### Chiang Kai-shek's Radio Address on the Eve of National Day

This Arduous War of Resistance Is a Path to Survival Amidst Death; We Must Be Resolved to Persevere, Endure Hardship, and Sacrifice Everything; We Hope the Entire Nation Will Rise Up and Strive to Achieve the Ultimate Goal of Victory

[Nanjing] On the eve of National Day, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a radio address to the people of the whole country. The original text is as follows:

Fellow countrymen, this year's National Day is a time of the most severe suffering and hardship for our nation, but it is also the only important time for the revival of our nation. Our country is suffering from the incomparably fierce invasion of a brutal enemy, and the whole country is engaged in a difficult war of resistance, fighting for the survival of the country with our flesh and blood. However, in this war of resistance, the enthusiastic patriotism of our overseas compatriots and the righteous and courageous struggle of the people of the whole country are enough to move and inspire us, and we deeply believe that we will be able to seek revival from extreme hardship. On this glorious anniversary, I have a few important words to tell our compatriots. First of all, we must know that this war of resistance is a battle for survival amidst death, and we must go through extraordinary dangers and difficulties to achieve final victory. Fellow countrymen, we must have a real understanding that the initial efforts must be followed by greater courage and sacrifice. We must recognize that this war of resistance is by no means something that can be concluded in a short period of a year and a half. We must anticipate that the hardships and difficulties in the future will only increase day by day. Therefore, we must prepare everything to bear a situation that is dozens of times more difficult and arduous than today. Only by establishing the determination to sacrifice to the end can we achieve the goal of national survival. Since the beginning of the war of resistance, the heroic and magnificent sacrifices of our soldiers at the front have inflicted great blows on the enemy and have exposed the enemy's weaknesses one by one. The international community has also shown infinite sympathy for our country. Recently, various countries have gradually made solemn and resolute expressions regarding upholding justice and respecting treaties and laws. Justice is gradually being extended. This is, of course, due to the inspiration of the brave and sacrificial spirit of the soldiers at the front, but there is also an important reason, which lies in the unity and solidarity of our country. Countries around the world have seen that our country has been divided and scattered for the past twenty years, and has never had such a unified spirit of the whole country as it does today, nor has it been able to fight against foreign aggression as a whole as it does today. Now we have unified will and sincere unity. Because of our unity and solidarity, the sacrifices of the soldiers have generated doubled strength. Because of our unity and solidarity, countries around the world have developed infinite sympathy and support for us. We must also know that true victory must be sought through long-term hard struggle and cannot be obtained by chance. International sympathy is enough to excite us, but we must not rely on it. We must first help ourselves before others can help us. Therefore, our people must first be resolved to persevere, endure hardship, and sacrifice everything, and we must fight to the end without turning back. We must overcome all dangers, bear any hardship and difficulty, and we must temper ourselves and transform our nation in the war of resistance to create a new national life. Secondly, we must not only maintain unity from beginning to end, but also continue to consolidate solidarity. We have already demonstrated the greatness of the power of national unity and national unification at the beginning of the war of resistance. We must also demonstrate our unity and strengthen our solidarity in the war of resistance. We must achieve common consistency in advancing, retreating, living, and dying, and we must share weal and woe from beginning to end. Under the highest interests of the nation, we must absolutely respect discipline and obey orders to win the final success, so that we can be worthy of the soldiers who have died and the martyrs, and we will not fail the sympathy of friendly countries. Third, we must establish the belief that we will win. This war of resistance is not only for national survival, but also for human justice and international credibility. Conversely, the enemy is fighting for aggression, not only destroying international credibility, but also making itself an enemy of the world and humanity. This inhuman and unfaithful war of aggression is what is called an unjust cause, and there is no way it will not fail and perish. The ancients said, "An army is strongest when it is young, and weakens when it is old." It is also said, "Those who gain the Tao receive much help, and those who lose the Tao receive little help." The current war of resistance proves that the enemy has already declared its doomsday and failure in spirit and in fact. As long as the whole country is united and sacrifices to the end, there is no way we will not achieve final victory. I have said before that the first stage of the National Revolution was to complete the unification of the country, and the second stage was to complete the independence of the country. In spirit, it is consistent. Now is the time when the second stage of the National Revolution is encountering a severe test, and it is also the time when the mission is about to be completed. As long as the people of the whole country move forward with one heart and one mind towards the goal of the Three People's Principles, I believe that there is no way we cannot achieve success. I myself, having been entrusted by the Central Government and the hope of the people, will surely follow the people of the whole country from beginning to end, leading all the soldiers, being loyal and courageous, and fighting to the end even if there is only one soldier left. I have an unshirkable responsibility to the country, the nation, my subordinates, and the Premier's principles, and I have long been determined to do my best to serve our party, our country, and all our compatriots. I only hope that our compatriots across the country, regardless of men, women, old, and young, will each contribute their abilities, and under the leadership of the Central Government, do their best, work together, and strive to first concentrate the power of the war of resistance, and then eliminate the invasion of the brutal enemy, so that our nation can become a nation that can stand side by side with all countries in the world. Fellow countrymen, we have 5,000 years of culture and history, 40 million square miles of land and resources, and 400 million people, making us the largest nation in the world. We believe that this great nation, as long as we have the spirit of sacrifice and struggle, will never be eliminated by others. Everyone must remember the last will of our Premier, which is called "peaceful struggle to save China." This sentence is not only to save ourselves, but also to save the world. This is the spirit of Christ's sacrifice, universal love, and peace. This truth is forever indelible. We should know that today's sacrifice and struggle is the foundation for establishing lasting peace, and it is the only way for us to save the country, save the people, save others, and save ourselves. In Chinese and foreign history, there is no nation that can survive without sacrifice, and there is no reason to achieve peace without struggle. If there is, then only those who are content to be slaves of a subjugated country and listen to others' commands will have this dream. The closer this war of resistance gets to the end, the greater the sacrifice we need to make, and the heavier our responsibility will be. However, our bright future lies in this darkness, waiting for us to struggle forward. Therefore, all compatriots, regardless of the front or the rear, must absolutely remove the mentality of being content with the status quo and seeking peace and security, and continue to work hard and become more and more energetic. All staff members must be determined to sacrifice themselves, take the lead, and work hard. The success or failure of our current situation is related to the good fortune, safety, and danger of the descendants of our nation. We must sacrifice everything for ourselves to seek the lasting happiness of the country and the nation. Fellow countrymen, on this important anniversary today, may everyone be determined to follow the example of the revolutionary martyrs of the past decades, step on the bloodstains of our soldiers at the front, rise up together, work hard for the country, the war of resistance will surely be victorious, and the Republic of China will surely have a bright and splendid future. Finally, I would like to express my highest respect to all the soldiers and civilians who have sacrificed for the country in this war, and express my deep love and protection to their families.

### National Government Awards and Encourages Soldiers Against the Enemy

[Nanjing] Order of the National Government on the 10th: Since the establishment of the Republic of China in the 26th year, we have been striving to strengthen diplomatic relations with foreign countries and to develop domestic construction, hoping to revitalize the nation and establish a foundation for lasting peace in East Asia. However, since the September 18th Incident, our eastern neighbor has been relying on its strength to invade and bully us, and it has not stopped. Recently, it has even violated treaties, disregarded humanity, and mobilized its land, sea, and air forces to launch a large-scale invasion, occupying our territory, slaughtering our people, and indiscriminately bombing unarmed cities across the country, which is cruel and atrocious, shocking China and foreign countries. The government has the inescapable responsibility to defend the country and protect the people, and it has no choice but to engage in a full-scale war of resistance. Thanks to our soldiers at the front who have obeyed military orders and pioneered for the country, fought hard for months, advancing one after another, their loyalty and courage are enough to help the world and inspire the people. However, to contain the brutal and powerful enemy, it is important to be able to persevere. We hope that you will strengthen your training and advance to achieve success. On the occasion of the anniversary of the founding of the country, we are deeply concerned about the importance of the backbone of the country. The Military Affairs Commission is instructed to send the message to the front lines, give generous awards and encouragement, and instruct the military commanders at all levels to investigate and report on the officers and soldiers who died in battle for commendation and consolation. Those who are injured in battle should be given medical treatment and care, and everything should be done carefully, so as to live up to the government's utmost concern for loyalty and courage. This is the order. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)

### Declaration to the Nation from the Central Propaganda Department

[Nanjing] The Central Propaganda Department issued a declaration to the nation on the occasion of National Day, initiating a campaign to raise labor funds and cotton clothing, saying: China has always established the country with peace, the national policy is upright, and there are few rivals in the world. However, due to the sowing of bad influences, the people have become weak and the country has declined. We have only sought temporary peace and complete preservation, and we have almost lost the self-confidence to dare to fight against the powerful. This has made the foundation of the country precarious and cannot last a day. The September 18th Incident was caused by this. For the past five or six years, relying on the military and civilians of the whole country under the leadership of the supreme leader, we have been trying to reverse the decline and working hard until now, and we have finally been able to demonstrate our ability to resist the powerful enemy. Before the praise of the world, although it is a little late, it is a major progress for our country. This is commendable and completely different from the past. Just look at the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, and the whole country asked to enlist, determined to gamble everything and make the heroic act of fighting to the end. The soldiers at the front fought bitterly, suffering casualties, and the refugees in the war zone forgot their grievances and complaints. The whole country, from top to bottom, swore to share the fate of the country and the nation with their lives and property, knowing that the long-term war of resistance would be extremely tragic, but all firmly believed that the final victory would belong to us. Even though Chu has only three households, it will surely destroy Qin. The fate of the nation will last forever. All the habits of seeking temporary peace and thoughts of complete preservation were swept away three months before the National Day of the 26th year of the Republic of China. This kind of spirit has never been seen in the past, and to the extreme, it will eventually be enough to sweep away the enemy's atmosphere and revitalize the national prestige. On this day of the success of the Xinhai Revolution, we should use this to comfort the spirits of the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the founding and defending of the country, and we should all swear to follow the bloodstains of the martyrs to forge ahead. However, although the opportunity to turn weakness into strength has already been created by the soldiers and civilians who are determined not to change their minds, the responsibility of rewarding merit and comforting the wounded should indeed be shouldered by us, the people of the country who live peacefully in the rear. Remember that at this time when the battle clouds are high and the festival is approaching again, if we still commemorate it as usual, it will not only obliterate the meaning of this year and today that is different from the past, but it will also violate the spirit of comrades and compatriots who should share weal and woe. The only plan is to raise labor funds on National Day to express our sincere respect to the pillars of the country, and to make winter clothes at the beginning of autumn to share the cold and warmth for those who are in need in this world, so that the brave soldiers on the battlefield will be more determined to drink the blood of the dragon, and the wounded soldiers on the sickbed will regain their strength to wrap their wounds and fight again. Even the displaced people will deeply appreciate the thought of the three armies sharing the same clothes and sing the song of common hatred without clothes, so that we can comfort the national sacrifices and martyrs in the ground and encourage the morale of the soldiers and the people in the country, and consolidate the foundation for the country to be celebrated for billions of years. With our 400 million divine and noble Chinese people, if each person contributes one dollar, we can immediately raise 400 million yuan. With our 200 million beautiful needlework women, if each person takes up a needle, we can immediately make 200 million winter clothes. With a single donation and a single move, the vitality of the country and the nation depends on it. The people of the country, do not neglect it, and do it quickly. The Propaganda Department of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

### The Enemy Intends to Build a Bridge to Invade Across the Yellow River, But Fails

Our Guerrillas Harass the Enemy's Rear; the War in Northern Shanxi Will Have New Developments

[Jinan] The main force of the enemy is still on the north bank of the old Yellow River. This morning, under the cover of airplanes and artillery, they attempted to build a bridge at the Yellow River cliff, but were driven away by our armored vehicles and troops and destroyed it. Our powerful guerrillas have been very active in the enemy's rear. Today, six enemy planes successively bombed Taian, causing no major losses, only bombing two or three sections of the railway track, and three bombs fell in the city. They also bombed Dakou and Yanzhou. In addition, an enemy plane scouted the areas of Pingyuan, Gaotang, Yucheng, and Enxian. (Special dispatch, 9th)

[Jinan] Our guerrillas harassed the enemy's rear, and a large number of reinforcements have arrived, and the enemy is very afraid. Yesterday, they retreated north of Huangheyazhan, and the front line is silent. Our armored vehicles are stationed north of Pingyuan Station, waiting for orders to advance. (Special dispatch, 9th)

[Beiping] The Japanese army has suffered heavy damage from attacks by the Chinese elite artillery behind them. Now the Japanese army, concerned about the safety of the rear, has decided to deploy heavy troops along the main roads to prevent repeated attacks from both the front and the rear. It is said that the Japanese army's material losses are also quite heavy, and the occupied land cannot be regarded as being under its rule, so it feels quite tricky. (National Maritime Telegraph dispatch, 9th)

[Jinan] Military rest, on the Tianjin-Pukou front, the remaining enemies are still on the north bank of the old Yellow River, constantly launching attacks on our positions, all of which have been repelled. Our guerrillas have bypassed to the far rear of the enemy. This afternoon, two enemy planes flew to Jining and strafed our airfield, dropping two bombs, with no losses. It was rumored in the evening that a certain unit of our army launched a flanking attack, and there was talk of recapturing Dexian. (Special dispatch, 8th)

[Taiyuan] The Central News Agency reporter recently met with a military expert here and talked about the course of the battle on the western front. The expert expressed the opinion that since the outbreak of the battle on the western front, our army has been at a disadvantage everywhere. The reason for this has been clearly pointed out by Commander Yan in his public speech a few days ago, that is, the enemy is active and our army is passive, so we are constantly being restrained by the enemy. Most of our army's fighting strength is consumed in coping, which is regrettable. If our army changed its position and took the offensive, although it may not have the power to win, the enemy would at least have to divide its forces to cope with our side, so the situation in northern Shanxi may not be what it is today. The expert continued, regarding this point, the authorities have a deep understanding and awareness, and are determined to improve the past mistakes, and have agreed on a new strategy. Once the newly added troops on the front line are deployed, they will be implemented according to the new plan, and the war in northern Shanxi will soon have a new appearance. We can wait and see.

### Reflections on National Day

— Wu Tegong

Time flows like a river. The Double Tenth National Day arrives again suddenly. The four northeastern provinces have fallen into enemy hands and have yet to be recovered. This year, compounded by the rampant atrocities of bandits, the flames of war are raging everywhere. In the north, they extend to the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. In the south, they are confined to the Shanghai area. The coastline is blockaded, shipping is cut off, and trade with Sichuan has come to a standstill. Coastal ports are constantly bombarded, and cities and towns in various provinces are repeatedly bombed. The areas where the fighting is most intense have been reduced to scorched earth. Millions of people are displaced, and millions more are suffering from unemployment, hunger, and cold. What is even more painful is that non-combatant civilians are indiscriminately slaughtered by enemy planes everywhere, with countless casualties. Even infants in swaddling clothes are not spared. The cruelty is appalling and arouses worldwide sympathy. All of us compatriots are filled with hair-raising, eye-splitting, grief and indignation. On this grand occasion, we may be reluctant to force a smile and celebrate together. However, I, for one, believe that precisely because of the tragic warfare this year, we should celebrate this National Day with even greater enthusiasm amidst the thunder of cannons and the roar of planes. Readers, please do not criticize me for violating the psychology of ordinary people. Please allow me to state my reasons.

This is the twenty-sixth National Day anniversary. The most enthusiastic celebration was undoubtedly the first year of the success of the Revolution and the establishment of the Republic. However, since the fifth year of the Republic, when Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands and the traitor Yuan Shikai accepted them, the future of the Republic has become increasingly bleak. Thereafter, national humiliations have piled up, and a cloud of sorrow has enveloped the nation. In the course of a year, the only day that could inspire people was this National Day anniversary. However, with urgent foreign threats and frequent internal wars, the people's hearts were filled with pessimism. On this day each year, people merely hung up the national flag as a token gesture. It was not until the sixteenth year of the Republic, when the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition was completed and the capital was moved to Nanjing, that the people harbored great hope for the Party and the nation. Therefore, the National Day celebration that year was more enthusiastic than ever before. However, in less than a few years, the September 18th Incident suddenly occurred. The National Day fell less than a month later. At that time, the people's grief was intense, and they had no time to celebrate. The National Government even declined congratulations from foreign envoys. Thereafter, on each anniversary, the officials in charge invariably exhorted the people to wipe out humiliation, save the country, and recover lost territories. However, the insatiable Japanese aggressors continued to encroach upon North China step by step, repeatedly losing national sovereignty. Our people were perplexed by the government's forbearance and non-resistance. Foreign friends even ridiculed our submission with "slapping our faces and offering smiles." In July of this year, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. Our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, at the point of being unable to endure any longer, still emphasized the importance of preserving peace and put forward three minimum conditions for resolving the incident. However, the Japanese aggressors, with their conspiracy long in place, suddenly dispatched a large army to occupy our Beiping and Tianjin and sent a fleet to Shanghai to create provocations, in an attempt to advance both north and south and implement the continental policy of the Tanaka Memorial. At this point, Chairman Chiang realized that concessions had reached their limit and peace was completely hopeless. He then resolutely made a great decision to make great sacrifices and resist the enemy. Once the order was issued, the whole country rejoiced. Thus, the Japanese dream of intimidating and subduing China with force was shattered, and their national order was disrupted due to the use of force. And countries around the world, because we did not lose our dignity as an independent nation, praised us unanimously. The world's most authoritative London Times stated that our resistance against Japan has secured our national integrity and that our international status has risen to an unprecedented level. These words truly represent the public opinion of the world. Therefore, although the final victory in this war is yet to come, we have already achieved such great results. This is the first reason why this year's National Day should be celebrated with even greater enthusiasm.

Since the slogan "Might is Right" has prevailed in the international arena, militarist countries have regarded their weak neighbors as meat on a chopping board, to be slaughtered at will. At first, they only tested their skills slightly and engaged in gradual encroachment. Then, because they benefited from their actions, they became even more aggressive and engaged in outright annexation, even to the point of destroying other countries and enslaving their people. International morality has been completely lost, and the explicit terms of treaties are equivalent to waste paper. In addition, with the advancement of modern science, the instruments of killing have become increasingly fierce. Those who engage in violence then use them to display their terrifying means, even to the point of disregarding the extermination of humanity. Although there are countries among the nations that advocate justice, they only utter empty words to express their indignation and never uphold righteousness by using force to stop them. As a result, countries that engage in violence become even more unscrupulous, even regarding themselves as the supreme legal authority in the world. Countries that share the same vile tendencies then follow suit, causing the world to descend into a state of anarchy. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said to a reporter from the Associated Press a few days ago, "When the September 18th Incident occurred, the international community failed to cooperate in upholding the obligations of treaties, causing the world to encounter various serious consequences." Therefore, treading on frost leads to solid ice, and it is important to prevent problems before they arise. Alas, if this state of affairs is allowed to exist, then the word "peace" can be deleted from the dictionary, and the effectiveness of justice will disappear from the world. Not only will weak countries that are being invaded be unable to protect their safety, but even strong countries that have dealings with those violent countries that embrace aggression will be in danger. Because violent countries are not short of like-minded individuals, they only seek profit. It is difficult to guarantee that they will not unite to apply the means used against weak countries to isolated strong countries. Well said, President Roosevelt said in a speech in Chicago, "The state of anarchy in the international community is enough to destroy all foundations of peace and endanger the present or future security of all countries, whether strong or weak." There is another cause for concern: If the powerful and violent gain the upper hand and run rampant in the world, then they will only value force and obliterate everything else. All religions, cultures, and academic disciplines will have no room for survival, because religions, cultures, and academic disciplines are all in conflict with the doctrine of aggression and cannot coexist. President Roosevelt has also taken this into account. He said, "We can foresee that if humanity reaches a point where it takes pleasure in slaughter, then it will run rampant throughout the world, causing all cultures and arts, and all the treasures accumulated over thousands of years, the weak, the small, and the defenseless, to disappear without a trace." From this perspective, can Japan's aggression against China be allowed to run rampant without being stopped? This is why Chairman Chiang, when absolutely necessary, resisted with our China alone, without waiting for the assistance of other countries. He did so not only to defend ourselves but also to save the world. If we were still to endure at this point, then Japan could easily satisfy its ambitions against China, and then dominate the entire Pacific region and continue its brutal aggression, bringing disaster to other countries in Asia. Even those countries that have colonies in the Far East would be hard-pressed to avoid being harmed. Therefore, this war contains supremely important significance. It is not merely a struggle for self-defense. Fortunately, conscience has not died, and justice has not been extinguished. The General Assembly of the League of Nations has passed a report condemning Japan and will convene a conference of signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty to reaffirm the obligations of the sacred treaty. And President Roosevelt, for the sake of upholding justice and humanity, has delivered a brilliant and forthright speech, raising his arm and calling out, causing the demons to tremble in fear. Others, such as Archbishop Lang of Canterbury, disregarded the protests of Japanese fellow believers and condescended to attend a mass rally at Albert Hall, speaking out to condemn Japan's trampling on humanity and advocating that the British government, in conjunction with other countries, implement economic sanctions to curb its atrocities. In addition, mass organizations around the world and great politicians from various countries have either expressed ardent sympathy for our people or have already begun to conduct boycotts of Japanese goods or have raised money and medicines to help our refugees and wounded soldiers. The fact that the war of resistance has been able to gain such worldwide sympathy is unprecedented in ancient and modern times. On the other hand, the violent Japanese aggressors have only one or two like-minded countries to defend them. Their current position is no different from being the target of public criticism. Therefore, although the final victory on the battlefield in this war of resistance against Japan is yet to come, we have already achieved a moral victory. This is the second reason why this year's National Day should be celebrated with even greater enthusiasm.

My beloved compatriots, do you also know why the governments and peoples of various countries are expressing such ardent sympathy for us? The September 18th Incident was also an act of Japanese aggression against China, but at that time, they merely perfunctorily dealt with it with the report of the Manchurian Investigation Team. Why then are they now taking a further step by convening a conference of signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty to uphold the dignity of the treaty? Some say that this is due to the fact that Japanese planes indiscriminately bombed Chinese civilians. However, to say that this is one of the factors is acceptable, but to say that this is the main reason is wrong. British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech in Scarborough yesterday, "The war in China and Spain, in which airplanes are used to bomb non-combatant men, women, and children, is truly a matter of heartache. However, in the natural indignation aroused by this type of action, one point may be overlooked. What is this point? It is that the cruelty, barbarism, and the death, starvation, and hardship of civilians are unavoidable consequences of modern warfare. The real crime against humanity is in not seeking to resolve disputes through peaceful discussion but in destroying dignified treaties and resorting to force." Therefore, even if Japan does not use airplanes to bomb our civilians, its crimes are still unforgivable. However, with the bombing of our civilians by airplanes, its crimes are all the more egregious. As for why the governments and peoples of various countries are expressing such ardent sympathy for us this time, there is more than one reason. I will elaborate on this later. Furthermore, in the midst of our celebration, we should all firmly remember Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's words to a reporter from the Associated Press: "We are now fighting to achieve the goal of the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops so that we can continue our peaceful construction plans. Our determination to defend ourselves has been consistent from beginning to end. Even to the last soldier and the last inch of territory, we will not change our original intentions. We will not stop our resistance until justice is established and the treaty is reaffirmed." My beloved compatriots, you must know that the position our country occupies today is not easily obtained. Now, the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty will meet within two weeks. However, the issue is complex, and discussion will require time. And the Japanese Diet will meet in December. Therefore, the next two months are a critical juncture. If the war situation can remain unchanged, then there will definitely be developments favorable to our side in these two months. The victory in the front-line battles depends on loyal and brave generals and soldiers, but it also depends on the enthusiastic assistance of the people in the rear. Enthusiastically celebrating National Day is only a superficial form of patriotism. Only by contributing manpower, financial resources, and material resources to the country is it true patriotism. Compatriots, you must know that having a country to love is truly the supreme happiness in life. Do you not see that the compatriots in the four northeastern provinces cannot love their country even if they want to?

### Inertia and Revolution

— Guo Moruo

— Written in commemoration of the 26th National Day —

The Xinhai Revolution was the prelude to the victory of the demand for democratic politics over autocratic politics in our country. This battle is still continuing, not only within our country but also in our international relations. More specifically, our current war of resistance against Japan can also be said to be a war between democratic politics and autocratic politics. The fact that Puyi, whom we deposed twenty-six years ago, was kidnapped by the Japanese to serve as the puppet emperor of "Manchukuo" is an event worth mentioning today on the anniversary of National Day.

The Japanese scholar, the late Dr. Naito Konan - this person had close ties with Luo Zhenyu, Wang Guowei and others, and those who study Sinology mostly know him - he once wrote an article praising Puyi for having the demeanor of Emperor Guangwu. This remark was actually not praising Puyi, but rather openly expressing Japan's ambition for our China. They have a historical analogy, believing that since our China has both the Former Han and the Later Han, there should also be a "Former Qing" and a "Later Qing," and this dreamed-of "Later Qing" should be a vassal state of Japan.

However, such a circuitous "Later Qing" dream, even in the eyes of the Japanese young military, I believe, would not be worth laughing at. Because they are more direct and straightforward, they are the reincarnation of Genghis Khan. They do not value the child emperor as highly as circuitous scholars do. However, the spirit is always the same set, which is to use the inertia of autocratic politics to hinder our revolutionary movement of democratic politics. For twenty-six years, our efforts to establish democratic politics have been greatly hindered, both internally and externally, and this hindering force is greatest in Japan, because most of our internal resistance is also cultivated and nurtured by the Japanese. The Japanese boast that they are "the stabilizing force in East Asia." With a slight modification, we can acknowledge this to mean that Japan is "the stabilizing autocratic force in East Asia." However, this "stability" is only artificial and temporary. The evolution from autocracy to democracy is the basic trend of human evolution. Observing the evolution of the one-male autocratic ape society into a more enlightened human society, one can see the foreshadowing of this trend. Today, in the twentieth century, to try to hinder the evolution of human society with the inertia of autocratic politics is merely a temporary afterglow of the ape society. I believe that the Japanese's "Later Qing" dream and "Genghis Khan" dream can never be realized.

The establishment of Japan is fundamentally incompatible with us, and we are now in a war of survival against her. We also believe, based on the principles of evolution, that the final victory will surely belong to us. We commemorate our glorious National Day in the sound of artillery fire of this war of resistance. We will fire more cannons as celebratory cannons for celebrating National Day, and we will kill more enemies as sacrificial offerings for celebrating National Day, but in addition to celebrating, we should also intensify our self-examination. We must—

Remind ourselves of the revolutionary spirit of establishing democratic politics,

Promote our elimination of autocratic inertia! (October 9)

### The Enemy's Attack on Guangfu Town Repelled; Our Troops Bloodily Defeated the Enemy at West Sixth House

Enemy Daredevils Attacking Cao Wang Temple Cleared Out By Us; Remnants of the Enemy Fleeing Across the Yunzaobang River Have Fallen Into a Desperate Situation; Two Enemy Tanks Destroyed at Jiangwan and Zhabei

Enemy troops declared they must advance to the Shanghai-Songhu Agreement line before October 10th; therefore, in the past week, they have deployed their full strength of the army, navy, and air force, launching offensives on all fronts. Now that the deadline has passed, not only have they failed to achieve their wish, but they have also suffered heavy losses in men and equipment, suffering repeated and disastrous defeats. Their tricks are exhausted, and they can only dream. The war situation on all fronts before 4 AM this morning is as follows: ㊀ On the Zhabei front, at 1:30 AM yesterday morning, about two enemy companies advanced from Six-Three Garden towards our Baziqiao (Eight Character Bridge). We ambushed them from two directions, fighting fiercely until about 4 AM, when the enemy finally collapsed and retreated, with more than ten killed. After dawn, the enemy attacked with artillery, and our army also returned fire with artillery. Also, before dawn, about one enemy company attacked from Guangdong Street. Our army immediately concentrated fire and fought bravely, engaging in fierce fighting for as long as three hours. By a little after 6 AM, the enemy began to collapse and retreat, with more than fifty killed by us and one tank destroyed. ㊁ On the Jiangwan front, over the past two days, the enemy has continuously used small units to harass the Ye Family Garden and Racecourse area. However, as soon as they saw our army attack, they immediately retreated. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, several hundred enemy troops suddenly advanced from the Sijing Golf Course towards Hejia Lane and the Municipal Cemetery. Our army also split up to meet the attack, engaging in fierce fighting for about two and a half hours, after which the enemy finally collapsed and retreated. In this battle, more than one hundred and twenty enemy soldiers were killed, and one of their tanks was destroyed. ㊂ The enemy who attempted to cross south at Tangqiao has already been blocked by our fresh troops. Yesterday morning, the enemy repeatedly attempted to build bridges to cross and resupply, but they were destroyed by us. The enemy's retreat route has been cut off, and the date of their elimination should not be far off. The enemy at Black and Large Huang House, west of the highway, is currently being surrounded and pursued. Although the enemy strengthened their fortifications before dawn yesterday, seemingly intending to hold out for a long time, we have strictly intercepted them, and their plan is bound to fail. As for the enemy at West Sixth House, they have been severely attacked by our army since yesterday morning, and more than half have been annihilated. Furthermore, the enemy attacking the front of Guangfu Town to the Xinmu Bridge area has been repelled by us. ㊃ The enemy troops at Luodian launched a raid with a suicide squad on our positions around Shi Xiangong Temple and Cao Wang Temple, but they were all cleared out by us, and we seized many spoils of war. Since yesterday morning, the enemy has only fired remotely with artillery, and their infantry no longer dares to attack. Our army still strictly guards the line. ㊄ On the Pudong front, enemy warships frequently bombarded our Pudong positions with artillery yesterday morning, and we returned fire several times, inflicting considerable losses on the enemy. At about 4 PM, an enemy plane reappeared over the Huangpu River, dropping several bombs, but our losses were minimal.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th: Military News, ㊀ On the morning of the 8th, the enemy crossing the river at Jiangjiazhai and Tangqiao had four enemy boats destroyed and sunk by our army's strong counterattack, killing sixty to seventy enemy soldiers and capturing five rifles and one light machine gun. In the afternoon, the enemy again used aircraft and artillery fire as cover to launch a fierce attack on us. Our army fought back fiercely and is still confronting them near Zhouchengzhai. ㊁ The enemy who crossed the river at Tangqiao Station on the 8th has not yet been completely repelled by the 9th, but our fresh troops have arrived. ㊂ The enemy troops actually used poison gas on the 9th. Our casualties are pending investigation. ㊃ The enemy on the Guangfu front launched a fierce attack on us on the 9th, but have been repelled.

The Enemy at Black and Large Huang House on the West Bank of the River Tenaciously Resist, Breaking Our Strict Blockade

The focus of the battle is currently developing along the Shanghai-Taicang Road between Liuhang, east and west of Tangqiao. Although the enemy south of Tangqiao has been almost completely annihilated by us, their ambition has not died. Yesterday morning, despite the rain, they still tried to build bridges to cross the river. Our army displayed its great power in the middle of the night, aggressively advancing on three sides of Qia Bang, destroying the enemy's temporary fortifications on the north bank of the river. With their retreat route cut off, the enemy dared not continue to advance.

Central News Agency, war correspondent, 12:20 noon on the 9th: The enemy at Black and Large Huang House on the south bank of the Yunzaobang River, west of the highway, is currently resisting tenaciously after being surrounded and attacked by us, trying to prolong their lives. Before dawn yesterday morning, a force suddenly rushed east, attempting to expand their position, but after our strict blockade, the enemy's plan has failed.

When the enemy attacked Black and Large Huang House on the south bank of the Yunzaobang River, they used tear gas. Many of our soldiers were poisoned, so the enemy was able to cross the river leisurely. The enemy's brutality is evident. After our reinforcements arrived, they launched a fierce counterattack starting yesterday afternoon, and the battle was extremely fierce. However, the enemy hid in temporary fortifications and dared not attack, seemingly intending to hold out for a long time.

The Enemy's Attack on the Xinmu Bridge Position Collapsed; Casualties Were Heavy

The enemy's 9th Division, southwest of Liuhang, fiercely attacked our West Sixth House position west of Tangqiao Station the day before yesterday, attempting to coordinate with the remnants of the enemy on the south bank of the Yunzaobang River. Starting at dawn the day before yesterday, the attack was particularly fierce. Despite the heavy rain, artillery fire continued all day, destroying our army's position. Our army responded calmly, holding firm and unyielding. However, due to the excessive destruction of the position, it was broken through. At noon the day before yesterday, our fresh troops arrived and launched a counterattack together, advancing in the rain. Although the enemy's artillery fire was dense, our entire army fought bravely, one falling as another rose. After several hours of bloody battle, the original position was completely restored. In the evening, the defeated enemy, with the addition of reinforcements, attacked our army's position again, and the bloody battle resumed. However, the previous fortifications had long been destroyed, making it difficult to defend, and it was broken through for the second time. Our rear troops rushed up to intercept, wiping out most of the attacking enemy. As of yesterday morning, both sides were still fighting fiercely, and the struggle was extremely intense. The enemy who infiltrated is west of Liuhang. On our army's Guangfu Town Xinmu Bridge area position, a large enemy force launched a relentless attack the day before yesterday. Artillery fire continued all day in the heavy rain, covering the advance of their troops. Our army fought bravely, and the attacking enemy never succeeded, suffering heavy casualties, collapsing and retreating. Yesterday morning, the enemy tried to attack again, but they were still driven away by our army.

The enemy at Gujiazhai, Liuhang, attacked Mengjiazhai, south of Guangfu Town, the day before yesterday, engaging in fierce fighting all day, but were eventually repelled by our army, causing a portion of them, who were stalemated with us near Lao Lüzhai, to be unable to hold out. Therefore, they moved southeast yesterday morning and gathered near Chenjia Lane on the north bank of the Yunzaobang River, seemingly intending to attack our position from the west.

The Enemy Daredevil Squad That Attacked Cao Wang Temple Was Surrounded and Annhilated; They Fled in Panic

Central News Agency, war correspondent, reported from the Shi Xiangong Temple front at midnight on the 9th, returning to Shanghai: At 4 AM on the morning of the 8th, the enemy organized three daredevil squads, groping in the darkness to our Cao Wang Temple area position. The enemy all held sickles on long bamboo poles, attempting to cut our barbed wire. The troops stationed in front of this position lay in the trenches, feigning ignorance. The enemy, thinking that our army was unprepared, swarmed in. The troops stationed on our right flank suddenly surrounded and attacked, and a fierce hand-to-hand combat broke out. Although our side suffered slight casualties, the enemy's deaths and injuries were several times greater than ours. After the fierce battle, the remaining enemy fled in panic and were intercepted by us, and we captured many spoils of war such as pistols, rifles, machine guns, telescopes, and grenade launchers. We also found diaries, talismans, and important documents among the enemy's corpses. After this heavy blow to the enemy, they dared not attack, only constantly bombarding our position with artillery. The front line has become quiet.

According to intelligence, in recent days, a portion of enemy troops, as well as military supplies and ammunition, etc., have been transported by car from Yangshupu via Jungong Road to the north, very busy, to reinforce and resupply the Liuhang and Luodian areas.

According to enemy soldiers captured near Lü Xiangong Temple, they are on the verge of running out of food while fighting near Luodian. Because the fields around Panjiazhai have been flooded by continuous heavy rains, making transportation difficult, they have used airplanes to transport canned food, etc.

The Enemy Covets Ye Family Garden and Hejia Lane; Enemy Tanks Destroyed

The recent battles in the Jiangwan area have been relatively quiet. Since the enemy withdrew heavy troops from that area, they have only coveted the Ye Family Garden line, harassing it from the evening of the 6th until now. Our army has responded calmly, immediately pursuing and killing the enemy when they come. Recently, no enemy traces have been seen. Also, in the Jiangwan Racecourse area, the enemy has occasionally dispatched small guerrilla units, in groups of more than ten people, to force our northeastern compatriots to probe our lineup and fortifications. After our army discovered this, they immediately pursued and attacked. In the past two days, due to continuous autumn rains, it has been very quiet.

Central News Agency, war correspondent, reported at 12:10 noon on the 9th: At 8 PM the night before last, the enemy troops at the Sijing Golf Course in Jiangwan attacked our Hejia Lane Municipal Cemetery area position, but retreated quickly due to unfavorable circumstances. Then, at 1:30 AM on the morning of the 9th, they attacked with reinforcements, engaging in fierce fighting for four hours. By 5 AM, the enemy had suffered more than one hundred and twenty casualties and had one tank destroyed before retreating in panic.

Central News Agency, war correspondent, reported at 12:20 noon on the 9th: In the Jiangwan area, our army's police-style line is frequently pushed forward, and the enemy's position is very close. The enemy's movements are clearly visible. Since last night until this morning, both sides have been lying in wait behind defenses, constantly shooting at each other from within the positions. The sound of gunfire has been intermittent, but there has been no fierce fighting. Occasionally, there has been artillery fire on the Zhabei side.

The Enemy Attacked Baziqiao and Sanyi Village From Two Directions, Killing More Than Thirty

The enemy at Six-Three Garden and the Japanese Cemetery on North Sichuan Road attacked our Zhabei position the day before yesterday and the day before, but after being ambushed and routed by our army, they still refused to give up. In the evening of the day before yesterday, the enemy launched several attacks on our Baziqiao area and the Sanyi Village area north of the railway on East Baoxing Road, but were met with fierce counterattacks by our army. The stubborn enemy not only made no progress, but also suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday morning, both sides continued to engage in artillery battles in that area until noon.

Central News Agency, war correspondent, reported at 12:10 noon on the 9th: At around 3 AM yesterday morning (the 9th), the enemy attacked the Yicun East Five Zhang section of Guangdong Street with one company, engaging in fierce fighting for three hours. The enemy suffered more than fifty casualties and had one tank destroyed. At around 6 AM, they began to retreat. Also, two enemy companies attacked our Baziqiao position from the Six-Three Garden Japanese Cemetery area at 1:30 AM that morning. Our army divided its troops and ambushed them from two directions, killing or wounding thirty of the enemy. By around 4 AM, they were also repelled.

### Fierce Fighting in Zhabei Last Night

Our Various Routes Succeeded in Annihilating Countless Enemies

(News this morning) On the right wing, at 6:30 PM on the 9th, there were engagements at various street intersections along North Sichuan Road. ㊀ At the East Baoxing Road intersection, the enemy was digging tunnels, seemingly planning to bury explosives. To preempt them, our army immediately rushed out of the trenches, crossed Qixiu Girls' School, and used hand grenades to destroy their fortifications. The two sides exchanged gunfire until midnight. ㊀ At Baoyuan Road, Guangdong Street, and Quan Highway, at around 7 PM last night, our army jumped up and threw grenades at the enemy's outposts, feigning a full-scale attack. The enemy was caught off guard and immediately retreated south towards North Sichuan Road. Our army then feigned temporary fortifications at the intersection of North Sichuan Road, set up machine guns, and waited. When the enemy saw that we were not chasing them, they sent tanks to reconnoiter. At around 8:30 PM, the two armies engaged in fierce fighting. At 9:30 PM, our army charged forward, killing more than thirty of the enemy. At 11 PM, our army retreated back to the Guangdong Street position, and the enemy dared not attack. ㊂ A dozen or so enemy daredevils launched an attack on our Baziqiao position from the Japanese Cemetery at 8 PM yesterday afternoon, hoping to seize our Liuying Road defense line. Our army had already been heavily prepared in this area in recent days. Therefore, they launched an ambush from the Fangjia Wooden Bridge area, along the Yokohama River and Liuying, simultaneously. The troops from Guangdong East Middle School also immediately moved from Tongli Road, crossed Six-Three Garden, and encircled them from the side. More than three hundred enemy troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Until about 1:30 AM this morning, more than fifty enemy troops at Baziqiao were surrounded and annihilated by us. Fighting is still going on in other areas.

### Fierce Battles in Luodian for Days; Enemy Suffers Over Two Thousand Casualties

We Intercepted More Than Three Hundred Rifles and Machine Guns; We Searched the Fallen Officers and Obtained Many Confidential Documents

The enemy in the Luodian area consists of the First and Second Regiments of the Taiwanese Infantry and the Forty-second and Forty-fourth Regiments of the Eleventh Division. Lately, in order to actively break through our front line, they have repeatedly increased heavy troops and launched fierce attacks on us. Our Wang Division, stationed there, has been engaged in bloody battles with the enemy every day from the 1st to the 5th of this month. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Taking advantage of the enemy's setback, our army launched a full-scale counterattack from the evening of the 5th, launching surprise attacks overnight, taking advantage of the wind, rain, and darkness to get close to the enemy's positions, and launching attacks with hand grenades and bayonets. The enemy suffered repeated heavy blows. In front of Shi Xiangong Temple and Cao Wang Temple, enemy corpses were scattered everywhere. In addition to those dragged back by them, hundreds of corpses were left behind. Our army found and confirmed enemy officers near their bodies, including Major Tanaka Kin, the first battalion commander of the Second Taiwanese Regiment, Captain Kawaguchi Joji, Captain Chida Nishio, Lieutenants Nishi Haru Arida, and Captain Bukuro of the Engineer Corps, and more than ten other officers. In total, over the past week, the enemy's losses from attacking our position and being surprised and attacked by us have totaled over two thousand. Our Wang Division intercepted 284 enemy rifles, more than ten light and heavy machine guns, and one grenade launcher. In addition, the deceased enemy officers had bags containing confidential important documents, maps, photos, charts, and various diaries and letters from officers. Examining the most common psychological expressions of the enemy's mid- and lower-level officers, most of them loathe war and miss their homes. The true feelings revealed in their family letters are particularly tragic. After our army reviewed them, they were sealed and sent to console their families.

Also, according to a broadcast from Tokyo at 6 PM on the 8th, Sergeant Takegami of the Ono unit said, "Our unit encountered strong resistance in the Luodian battle. The Chinese army often approached us at night using Japanese, causing us to become confused. Unit Commander Takehira has been killed in action. Fortunately, our unit only suffered sixteen deaths and injuries." This shows the intensity of the battle.

### Two Battalion Commanders Died Heroically After Killing Enemies; The Circumstances of Their Valiant Sacrifice

Commanded While Wounded, Refusing to Retreat Until Death

During the Battle of Liuhang in the middle of last month, our ××× Division defended the position near Yong'an Bridge. The enemy launched a full-scale attack. Our Battalion Commanders Yang and Chen supervised the battle at the front, boosting morale, charging, and inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. Unfortunately, they were wounded by stray bullets and sacrificed on the battlefield, killing enemies and displaying extraordinary heroism. The following is a record of the circumstances of the two battalion commanders' deaths:

The Circumstances of Yang's Death

At 9 AM on September 13th, the enemy from the Yanghang area attacked our Yong'an Bridge position. Yang Jiucun, the first battalion commander of the ×× regiment of our ××× division, immediately commanded his troops to fight back head-on, while using surprise troops to encircle the enemy and annihilate a portion of them. By 1 PM, the enemy had redeployed their full force to attack us, concentrating artillery and aircraft to bombard our position, and using six or seven tanks to attack our Gu Shifang position along the Bao-Liu Highway. The battle became increasingly fierce. Our Battalion Commander Yang personally led the reserve team to launch a fierce attack. While commanding on the front line, he was unfortunately wounded in the leg by a shell, and his bones were broken. Those around him advised him to retreat, but Yang firmly refused and continued to command calmly, killing over a hundred enemies. He finally repelled the enemy's main force, firmly holding the position, unmoved. Later, he fainted to the ground due to severe injuries and excessive blood loss. Those around him carried him to the rear, and he was transferred to Nanjing for treatment, but eventually died in the hospital due to his injuries being too severe. When the officers and soldiers heard this, no one did not shed tears. Yang, styled Shoushan, was from Weixian, Hebei. He graduated from the Lushan Military Officer Training Corps and served as platoon leader, company leader, regimental adjutant, and lieutenant colonel battalion commander. He is currently the battalion commander of the ×× regiment of the ××× division. He is usually strict in governing his troops, and his reputation is widely known. He is decisive and thorough in his work. The battalion's combat performance has always been excellent.

The Circumstances of Chen's Death

At 12 PM on September 15th, Battalion Commander Chen Hongyuan was ordered to take over the right wing, from the Nanpanjing to Xiaozhuzhai to Huoshaochang line. The enemy launched repeated fierce attacks, but all were repelled by the battalion. Finally, they used surprise troops to encircle and attack, killing over a hundred of the enemy. The enemy was wounded and dared not attack again. At 10 AM on the 16th, the enemy attacked with twice the battalion's strength, using concentrated artillery fire. Battalion Commander Chen led his troops in seven hand-to-hand combats, killing over two hundred of the enemy. In order to achieve their goal, the enemy reinforced their troops and used tanks to attack. Battalion Commander Chen held his position and supervised the battle, ordering his troops to resist to the death, not to retreat a single step, and to be punished by military law if they disobeyed. The officers and soldiers fought bloody battles, and the front line did not move. Unfortunately, Battalion Commander Chen was shot in the abdomen by an enemy gun and died on the battlefield. Just then, our Xiao Guangcan's battalion arrived as reinforcements, pursuing the victory and attacking, killing the enemy across the field. Our Battalion Commander Chen's officers and soldiers also sacrificed their lives for the country first. Battalion Commander Chen Hongyuan, styled Zijiu, was 36 years old, from Dingtao, Shandong. He graduated from the Northwest Cadre School and served as platoon leader, company leader, battalion regimental adjutant, and chief of staff. He is currently the lieutenant colonel battalion commander of the ×× regiment of the ××× division. He has a deep understanding of military science and is usually gentle and dignified, with the demeanor of a Confucian scholar. He is calm in combat and good at using wit, so he often overcomes the many with the few, achieving unexpected victories.

### The Enemy's Ammunition Transferred to Yufeng Cotton Mill

Fearing Our Artillery Bombardment

Central News Agency reports that the enemy's ammunition and other military supplies that have been transported in recent days, in addition to a portion that has been transported to the front for use, are stored in the wharves and warehouses along the Pudong area of Shanghai. According to a reporter's investigation, the Osaka, Huangpu, Huishan, and three wharves originally stored a large number of explosive enemy ammunition, bombs, shells, etc. Because our Pudong artillery positions have been continuously bombarding the area in recent days, the enemy has transferred all the explosive ammunition to the Yufeng Cotton Mill on Dongting Road, Yangshupu, for storage. The enemy's purpose is to use the nearby power plant as cover. The enemy's shamelessness is evident from this. In addition, the Osaka, Huishan, and Huangpu three wharves are still full of countless bullets. As for the North and Central warehouses of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, they contain food and other enemy military supplies.

### Matsui's Absurd Remarks Aim to Overthrow Our Government

Our Spokesman Says He is Not Surprised; Japanese Warlords' Wild Talk is No Different From Delirium

[Nanjing] Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the violent Japanese have been concentrating their army, navy, and air force to launch large-scale invasions of our various regions. At the same time, they have issued various absurd remarks to cover up their military setbacks and to threaten various countries in order to achieve their ambition of dominating East Asia. According to foreign wire reports, enemy General Matsui has once again made a comment in Shanghai, claiming that the Japanese army's purpose is to overthrow our central government and protect their various interests in China. Our government spokesman recently told reporters that we are not surprised by Matsui's talk of intending to overthrow our central government, because the Japanese warlords' policy towards China originates from their traditional aggression. Therefore, any government in China that can unify China and establish a peaceful and friendly foundation with various countries will be targeted by the Japanese warlords for overthrow. The September 18th Incident in the past was because the Japanese warlords witnessed the success of the National Government's unification and feared that it would hinder their aggressive purposes. Later, their gradual attempts to divide China in North China were merely to achieve their plan to destroy our unity. However, Japan's aggression and oppression only strengthened China's unity. Our government's strength to resist the enemy has also become more substantial because of this. Today, the National Government is a government supported by the entire country. Officers and soldiers from all provinces are on both the north and south battlefields, which is sufficient to prove that the central government has an inviolable force. Matsui's absurd remarks can be described as extremely arrogant. If he wants to overthrow the central government, he must destroy all of China's ten territories into scorched earth, which is difficult to succeed. This kind of delirious talk can make the world aware that the Japanese warlords have gone mad, and to maintain world peace, the people of all countries must remove these evil warlords from Japan. (Central News Agency, 9th)

### Double Tenth Festival in the Army

— Sun Yuanliang

On this year's Double Tenth Festival—National Day, my comrades and I in this army offer our country a solid axis of national defense, a source of deep honor. I believe that this axis is as strong as steel, capable of delivering extreme blows to the Japanese enemy.

From "August Thirteenth" to the present—a period of 58 days—the enemy has incessantly bombarded and attacked with aircraft, heavy artillery, and tanks, particularly intensely after September 29. They constantly seek to break through our defense lines, but our brave soldiers, with iron arms, have already shattered their delusions. The dedication and self-sacrifice of our officers and soldiers, contrasted with the enemy's cowardice and fear of death, is a stark difference. The enemy cannot cross this red line one step.

We must ask, why does the enemy lack courage and a spirit of sacrifice? The Japanese enemy itself is an aggressive group composed of warlords and arms dealers. Their intentions are so greedy and cruel, driving their people to their deaths in order to satisfy their selfish desires. Thus, the cowardice and fear of death among their officers and soldiers is understandable. Our soldiers shed blood for the survival of the nation and the righteousness of the world, sacrificing themselves for righteousness, and their courage is naturally abundant. Our guarantee of final victory lies in this.

The victory or defeat of war is determined by the strength of one's own will and collective consciousness. A long-term war depends even more on a spirit of perseverance and unyieldingness. This army has been fighting continuously for 58 days since its mobilization from the garrison on August 11, becoming stronger and more spirited with each battle. I am confident that we can continue indefinitely until we defeat the enemy. This is enough to contribute to my fellow countrymen, encouraging each other with perseverance, sharing the heavy responsibility of saving the nation and resisting the war. Recently, the comfort and assistance given to this army by the people in the rear, as well as the sympathy of international friends for our country, have further increased our efforts and courage. We pledge to wish the Chinese nation longevity with blood.

### Coming and Going in Bombing Raids

— Guo Moruo

㊀

I left Shanghai on the evening of the 20th and arrived at a certain place. Just as I was about to visit Luan Xiu, Ci Xiu and Minister Yu Qiaofeng came to meet me, saying they were going to the front to give a lecture to a certain division. So I was invited to get into the car again and set off for ××.

In the car, Ci Xiu told me that a certain division had the best combat record and was now reorganized and would be sent to the front line again, gathering officers above the rank of squad leader for a lecture.

Gathering the entire division's officers in front of the enemy to give a lecture, even at night, I felt was a bit risky.

Ci Xiu was also a little concerned about this risk. After a long silence, he suddenly said to me, "Tonight, we need to rely on your great fortune."

I didn't understand what he meant.

Ci Xiu then explained, saying, "Didn't you say in your own article that this year is your 'great luck year'?"

Hearing this, I suddenly understood. It turned out that Ci Xiu had read my article "Returning from Japan," where I wrote that I would have great luck at the age of forty-six.

The night was hazy, the moonlight hidden in the clouds, but its location was faintly discernible. When we reached our destination, red and various colored light balls were rising in the sky in front of us, signals set off by traitors. Then there was the sound of airplanes, but the silhouettes of the planes were not visible.

The officers had gathered in a field, having been waiting for a long time.

Ci Xiu invited Qiaofeng and me to give the lecture together, but we declined and stood by the side of the road, waiting.

The lecture lasted for more than an hour, because after Ci Xiu, the army commander and division commander also spoke.

In the middle of the lecture, a bomb suddenly fell with a loud crash, not far from the assembly point, naturally dropped by an enemy plane. But the officers stood firm, not even turning their heads.

After the lecture, we got back into the car and started our return journey. On the way, Ci Xiu said to me again, "Tonight, we really relied on your great fortune. If that bomb had landed in the middle of the ranks, wouldn't it have been a great disaster?"

Yes, I myself have recently started to believe in fate a little bit. It's just that I myself have been really fortunate in many things. Perhaps this is due to the blessings of the country and the nation? The saying "When a country is about to prosper, there will surely be auspicious signs" seems to make some sense. But I don't have the time to figure out this principle right now.

I parted ways with Qiaofeng at a certain place, as he was going to ××. He said he would be returning to ×× tomorrow afternoon, so I wanted to hitch a ride with him in his car and arranged to visit him in ×× tomorrow.

It was past 2 AM when we arrived at the headquarters. I spent the night in Ci Xiu's room.

### Britain Willing to Cooperate with All Nations to Uphold Treaties and Promote Peace

Chamberlain Elaborates on the Outline of British Foreign Policy in Echo to President Roosevelt’s Remarks

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain today attended the Conservative Party Congress in Scarborough and delivered an important speech outlining the main points of British foreign policy, focusing on important international issues, especially the situation in the Far East and the Spanish question. At the beginning of his speech, he praised Foreign Secretary Eden, saying that his work in maintaining peace was accomplished with talent and skill, and was commendable. He then spoke of President Roosevelt's speech on the fifth of this month, and unreservedly endorsed it, saying in brief that, although no formal declaration of war had been made, large-scale wars were in fact occurring in both Spain and China, and that these wars were characterized by the use of bombers, and that as a result, non-combatant men, women, and children were either bombed to death or maimed by weapons that were said to be aimed only at military targets, but which, judging by the circumstances, could not be considered accurate weapons. The bombing scenes were extremely tragic, and most people in the country felt indignant and indignant at the inhumanity, and sympathized with the victims of the bombing. This feeling is something that all human beings should have, but I think there is another genuine significance that cannot be ignored, that is, once a new type of war breaks out, all kinds of brutal and barbarous acts, such as the death and injury of non-combatants, the destruction of assets, and the distress of the people, are inevitable consequences. Moreover, the real crime against humanity is none other than violating solemnly adopted covenants and attempting to resolve any dispute by force without first attempting to resolve it by peaceful negotiation. Three days ago, a voice from across the Atlantic was timely, and the whole world listened attentively and rejoiced. Until now, the general public had thought that the most powerful country in the world, the United States, would only adopt a policy of obvious isolation, but President Roosevelt knew that if the scourge of unlawful action was allowed to spread without prevention, no country would be safe from attack. The President also said that the trustworthiness of promises and the sanctity of treaties should be restored, and this is not only representative of the psychology of the United States, but is also what Britain firmly believes in. The President also applied for cooperation from all countries to maintain peace, which the British government will naturally wholeheartedly support. Prime Minister Chamberlain then spoke of the convening of a nine-nation treaty conference by the League of Nations General Assembly, saying that he firmly believes that after President Roosevelt's speech, the United States government will definitely accept participation in this conference, so that it can discuss with other signatory countries ways to end the war in China. With regard to this, I am currently unable to say what action Britain will take, so as not to impose any restrictions on the government, but I can tell you that our main goal is to restore peace and maintain it, as it was in the past and is now. We are happy to cooperate with any plan that can achieve this goal. (Central News Agency, 8th, Havas)

Chamberlain's remarks on China have attracted much attention. The Prime Minister then spoke of other matters, saying that if Britain and Italy could make real progress on the Spanish issue, then the events mentioned in Mussolini's and his recent correspondence could be started to be discussed. As for armaments, he had to frankly say that their progress was not as rapid as he would have liked, but that this time Britain's armaments program was very large, and could not be compared with the preparations made in previous peacetime. Many preparatory works must be carried out in order. This stage has now been largely completed. The Prime Minister also briefly described the territorial army, the navy, and the air force, saying that the strength of the British air force in the country has almost tripled in the past two years. The Prime Minister also said that ordinary commerce is still thriving. At the end of June, the number of merchant ships under construction was 120% more than at the end of June 1931. The number of British merchant ships that were idle was only 3% of what it was six years ago. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that it was regrettable that Britain had to spend a huge amount of money on armaments, but the tragic situation in China today has made us realize that our security in avoiding this kind of tragedy is more precious than anything else.

### Three Ambassadors Gu, Guo, and Qian Issue Written Statements

Relating the Experiences of Attending the League of Nations Conference, the Resolution Is Deemed Unsatisfactory

[Geneva] Our country's ambassador to France, Dr. Gu Weijun, ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, and ambassador to Belgium, Dr. Qian Tai, because the League of Nations General Assembly has already closed, will all leave here to return to their posts. The Central News Agency's correspondent in Geneva took advantage of the opportunity before the three ambassadors left to present his visiting card and ask for their opinions on the following three questions: ㊀ Why did the League of Nations not invoke Articles 10 and 17 of the League of Nations Covenant in response to our country's complaint? ㊁ Will the sanctions clause of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant be able to be implemented in the future? ㊂ What are the impressions of the three ambassadors of the two reports of the Sino-Japanese Problem Advisory Committee and the resolution of the League of Nations? Ambassadors Gu, Guo, and Qian replied in written statements as follows:

This session of the League of Nations on the Sino-Japanese incident is divided into two reports. The "First Report" describes the facts of Japanese aggression and concludes: ㊀ Japanese military action goes beyond the scope of the initial incident; ㊁ Japan cannot justify itself based on treaties or legitimate defense; ㊂ Japan violated the Paris Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. The "Second Report" is a recommendation of measures, explaining that the Sino-Japanese dispute cannot be considered a matter only for China and Japan, and recommends that the countries of the Nine-Power Treaty discuss and try to find a solution. Before a result is obtained, the League of Nations General Assembly will provide spiritual assistance to China and advise the member states of the League of Nations ㊀ not to take any actions that would reduce China's ability to resist, and ㊁ each country to consider ways to assist China separately. This time, our country paid attention to the following points: ㊀ Denouncing aggression, ㊁ Implementing sanctions and not assisting Japan, ㊂ Assisting China. The results are listed as follows: Regarding ㊀ Regarding the report on denouncing aggression, the conclusion states that Japan has invaded Chinese territory and violated the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Pact. Although the word "aggression" was not used, the fact of aggression has been affirmed. ㊁ Regarding sanctions and not assisting Japan, since the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy failed, countries of all sizes have shied away from hearing about sanctions. Our side proposed that the League of Nations consider ways to stop Japanese aggression and not assist Japan in increasing its aggression, but countries refused to regard it as a disguised sanction. Our country had to continue to raise the issue at a later time. The opinions of the countries are that the League of Nations' recommendation to convene a Nine-Power Treaty Conference focuses on joint mediation. Since mediation is mentioned, sanctions cannot be mentioned. If mediation is ineffective, other measures will be mentioned again. Therefore, the Second Report stipulates that countries should propose measures to the General Assembly at any time, which is a step for future implementation of sanctions. ㊂ Assisting China. There was much debate on this section during the meeting. In the end, it was decided that the General Assembly would express spiritual assistance to China and that each country would consider ways to assist China separately. Because in reality only a few countries can assist China, with this League of Nations resolution, countries that assist us have more basis. This time, the League of Nations suggested that the Sino-Japanese incident be handled by the countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. Our representative explained that if the Nine-Power Treaty cannot proceed smoothly, our country can still request the League of Nations to implement measures. Therefore, the report states on the one hand that the countries of the Nine-Power Treaty must immediately discuss and convene a meeting as soon as possible, and on the other hand stipulates that the committee must convene within a month, and that the General Assembly will be adjourned without closing, all for future progress. Looking at the League of Nations resolution as a whole, it is of course far from our hopes, but in this handling of the Sino-Japanese incident by the League of Nations, after the Abyssinian incident, it coincided with the Spanish dispute, and Europe was too busy to look east. For a month, we have been working hard outside the meeting and arguing inside the meeting in accordance with the instructions of the government. Although our efforts have been hard, the result is only this, which is far from the expectations of the people, and we are deeply ashamed. However, all unresolved issues have been declared reserved. This report resolution can be considered a preliminary basis, which can be used as a foundation for future progress, and it is not completely empty. Now that the attitude of the United States is consistent with that of the League of Nations, the upcoming Nine-Power Treaty Conference should have results, and since there have been repeated reservations, our country can still continue to proceed with the League of Nations at any time. Guo Taiqi has already set off for London on the night of the 7th. Gu Weijun, Qian Tai, Jin Wensi, and Liang Long will return to their posts on the 8th. (Central News Agency, 9th)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Double Tenth Festival

— Yi

For the past six years, we could only celebrate the Double Tenth Festival with heavy hearts.

Today, as we celebrate the Double Tenth Festival, our hearts are much more relaxed. Because we have already gathered the strength of the whole country to fight to the death against the barbaric and violent enemy. This war has great historical significance. We have begun to embark on the road to national liberation. The light is ahead.

The lessons that the Double Tenth Memorial gives us allow us to see this light.

First, the main reason for the success of the Xinhai Revolution was that the people had the will to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. But at that time, the people's will was far less strong and widespread than the current national will to resist Japan.

Second, before the Xinhai Revolution, uprisings failed one after another, and martyrs were sacrificed in batches. Not only did this not diminish the revolutionary forces, but it made them increasingly strong. It can be seen that in the current national liberation war, military setbacks and the heroic sacrifices of soldiers are not enough to shake our confidence in final victory.

Third, the Xinhai Revolution was not successful by force. At that time, the revolutionary party's military strength was far behind that of the Qing government. But after the Wuchang Uprising, all places responded. Now that we are resisting the violent enemy on our own territory, it would of course be a serious mistake to estimate success or failure solely on the basis of military strength.

### Former Japanese Minister of Commerce Visits Germany on a Mission

Promote Economic Cooperation, Strengthen Anti-Communist Agreement

[Tokyo] Former Minister of Commerce and Industry Godo Takao, originally under the name of a national envoy, took a wheel to the United States from Yokohama on the 14th of this month and went to Germany. The summit meeting of the Japan Economic Federation was held on the afternoon of the 8th. Because Godo is now a councilor of the Federation, it was decided to appoint him as the representative of the Japan Economic Federation, so that he will have a greater mission of activity. Therefore, Godo's actions after his visit to Germany will also be backed by the Japan Economic Federation, which is formed by networking all levels of the Japanese financial community. At that time, all the Japanese financial community's demands for the German government and the German financial community can be accomplished by him alone. However, this kind of specific plan is still being carefully studied, and its general content is mainly about the financial and economic relations after the establishment of the Anti-Communist Agreement, and it will strongly advocate the close relationship between Japan and Germany, hoping to maintain a further intention.

[Rome] Officials here are unwilling to comment on Italian Ambassador to Japan Auriti's visit to Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Horinouchi today, but deny the claim that Italy has allowed Japan to provide military assistance. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 9th)

### Japan Purchases Large Amounts of Scrap Iron from Canada

[Vancouver] Newspapers here recently reported that Japan recently purchased 11,000 tons of scrap iron from Canada. This scrap iron comes from the dismantling of old ships. Moreover, Japan ranks first among countries that purchase scrap iron from Canada. (Central News Agency, Havas, 7th)

### Thoughts on Reading President Roosevelt's Speech

— Tang Mingshi

Since our entire country rose up to resist the enemy, what has made us the most distressed and puzzled is the indifferent attitude of the United States of America, which is known as our country's lifelong friend. But if we can understand the actual situation of the American political system, we may not be able to fully agree with the feelings of our ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, "We have not been disappointed in the end." Now we have indeed seen President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago on the 5th.

It turns out that the traditional foreign policy of the United States has always adhered to the Monroe Doctrine, that is, the so-called unwillingness to let Europe interfere in American affairs, nor to interfere in European affairs itself. At the beginning of the founding of the country, it was clearly known that the talent of Europe's horizontal and vertical arrangement was not something that simple America could match. Therefore, the ancestors told each other not to get involved. President Monroe just gave a concrete account of the ancestors' teachings. Later, the territory of the United States expanded day by day, and the humanities flourished. Although it was not comparable to the time when the country was founded, historical facts still proved the difficulty of this policy between gains and losses. For example, during the First World War in Europe, Wilson was president. Wilson ascended to the throne as a scholar, held his talent, and was eager to get angry. Therefore, he participated, but the good results of the war were nothing, and in political maneuvering, the Fourteen Points of the Peace Conference and the International League of Nations, the ideal became a dream, and he ended up in a mess, depressed. The lessons of the past are not far away, and smart people should know where to go. Although the American political system is centralized by the president, the term of office is limited by time, and political parties attack each other and enter when there is an opportunity. Therefore, the authorities must be good at using the so-called "diagnosis skills" to stand in an invincible position. Former President Roosevelt said it well, "Listen attentively to public opinion and shout from a high place." This is the unique democratic politics of the United States, and it is also the only way to maintain political power for oneself and the party. If you rely solely on theory and act rashly, you run the risk of ending your own political life and the political life of the party. This kind of public opinion, no matter what its source, whether it is a financial group, a newspaper group, the role of mature propaganda, or the outbreak of the people's sense of justice, must eventually reach a considerable degree of pressure before the responsibility for action can be borne alone.

In recent years, there have been many dangerous roads in European political relations, with the People's Front, the Fascist Front, the Franco-Russian Alliance, and the German-Italian Axis, which are intricate and incomprehensible to ordinary people. The United States is a wealthy and powerful country, and everyone wants to pull it to their advantage, but the American people have learned from the mistakes of the last European war and are determined not to be fooled again. Therefore, the maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine is becoming more and more firm, and various peace groups have been established. The Neutrality Act was enacted, intending to wash their hands and get rid of this chaotic vortex of war. Even if the authorities have ambitions, they cannot violate this intention. Otherwise, with the convenience of modern transportation, peace must be collective, so how can there be a deliberate adoption of this isolated policy that goes against the times?

This Neutrality Act was formed along with the roots of the Monroe Doctrine, so its application is of course aimed at European politics, and it is very clear that it cannot be applied to the situation in East Asia. However, in East Asian international relations, Great Britain is known as a hegemon, and Great Britain's diplomatic skills in East Asia are no different from those in Europe. The suspicion of the United States has thus restricted her actions. Looking at Stimson's active strategy, he encountered a cold situation. How can he not be discouraged by the examples before him? Hull's ambiguous attitude this time has a reason, and it is definitely not disappointing our hopes.

Now, Japan's atrocities are becoming more and more obvious, and the world is angry. Although Britain and France are carefully concealing their emotions, they cannot help but reveal their anxious mentality. This can dispel the suspicions of the United States. In addition, American public opinion is becoming more and more mature, and autonomous states in the Pacific such as New Zealand are vigorously urging it. At this time, as the British Archbishop of Canterbury said, "If we remain silent, people will mistakenly think that we are acquiescing." Roosevelt's declaration of restoring peace has probably been held for a long time, and he only hopes that the world's "90% of the peace-loving, just, and humanitarian people who are coerced by 10%" will gather together sincerely and wholeheartedly, and fight for peace, justice, and humanity. Suspicions should be eliminated, and expediency should not be used. Not only can the United States cooperate with the League of Nations this time, but the foundation of world peace can also be laid.

### I Am Willing to Participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Foreign Minister Wang Cables the League of Nations, Britain and the United States Conduct Preliminary Contacts, the US Plans to Propose Mediation Measures

[Geneva] China today notified the League of Nations that it is willing to participate in any international conference to discuss the Sino-Japanese situation. The League of Nations announced a cable from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui saying, "The Chinese government is happy to accept the League of Nations' invitation, but in view of the increasing Japanese military aggression, it hopes that the countries concerned will hold this conference as soon as possible in order to take effective measures, that is, to stop the Sino-Japanese conflict." (National Telegram, 9th)

[Washington] Britain and the United States today began preliminary contacts to prepare for the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. British Counselor to the United States, Marler, visited US Undersecretary of State Wilson today on instructions from British Foreign Secretary Eden. This morning, President Roosevelt met with Secretary of State Hull, Undersecretary of State Wallace, and US Envoy Davis, and decided to convene a full cabinet meeting to discuss international issues. According to private statements by State Department officials, The Hague, Locarno, or other neutral cities are all possible locations for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, and it does not have to be in Washington. (National Telegram, 8th)

[Washington] What resolutions were made at today's meeting of the United States Department of State has not yet been announced. According to State Department officials, the convening of a special session of Congress and the United States' diplomatic policy toward the Sino-Japanese situation were considered. As for whether the powers will be asked to unanimously declare economic sanctions against Japan, it is still a matter of speculation. The claim that the United States plans to greatly increase its military buildup program has now been denied by the highest administrative authorities. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 8th)

[London] Regarding the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the governments of Britain, France, and the United States are actively conducting talks. As far as is generally known, these countries have also considered the issue of inviting non-signatory countries (including Germany and the Soviet Union). (Central News Agency, Havas, 8th)

[London] According to official observations here today, US President Roosevelt will probably suggest a mediation method to Japan before supporting economic sanctions or other sanctions, and according to the same source, Japan may be willing to accept mediation methods without damaging its honor, firstly because the winter is approaching and Japan's front in China is already extremely afraid, secondly because Chinese volunteers within the puppet country are now rising up in large numbers, and it is difficult for the Japanese army to prevent them, thirdly because the Soviet Union's posture of intervening is becoming increasingly clear, and fourthly because world opinion is now unanimously opposed to Japan's actions. (National Telegram, 9th)

### Statement by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota

Distorting Facts, Covering Up Aggression

[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota issued a statement on the afternoon of the 9th, first expressing regret regarding the League of Nations' judgment and the U.S. State Department's statement. Secondly, he described the origins of the Gouqiao and Shanghai incidents, blaming China. Finally, he stated that Japan's actions toward China seek only that China abandon its anti-Japanese policies, the root of provocation against Japan, and achieve sincere Sino-Japanese cooperation for peace in East Asia, with no territorial ambitions whatsoever. Therefore, Japan's actions do not violate any existing treaties. He claimed that the Chinese government is manipulated by red forces, implementing stubborn and malicious anti-Japanese policies as national policy, and attempting to use force to exclude Japan's rights and interests in China, leading to the current incident, which he termed a violation of the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and a threat to world peace. The statement only defended Japan's actions as not violating treaties and did not mention whether Japan would attend the Nine-Power Conference, apparently because no invitation had been received. It also seemed to indirectly correct the statement made by the Foreign Ministry spokesman on the 6th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

[Tokyo] The "Nichinichi Shimbun" reported that Foreign Minister Hirota explained the international situation at the Cabinet meeting on the 8th, mainly as follows: The League of Nations, mindful of the Manchurian and Abyssinian precedents, is cautious in its attitude toward this incident. To evade responsibility, it has handed the matter over to the Nine-Power Conference. More importantly, advanced capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, and France see benefit in the existence of a state of war in one corner of the world, as it can lead to prosperity in finance and trade, so they are unwilling to delve deeply into the dispute and are focusing all their efforts on securing commercial interests. The Nine-Power Conference will merely clarify the principles of the League of Nations and emphasize pacifism, providing China with moral support but not taking joint action or adopting economic or financial blockades. The League of Nations' judgment that Japan violated the Nine-Power Treaty was unexpected. This should be discussed and decided by the nine countries themselves. If there is a proper and legitimate invitation to Japan for the Nine-Power Conference, Japan will not hesitate to participate. However, Japan will not tolerate being labeled as an aggressor state and then summoned. Japan is prepared to thoroughly refute the League of Nations' judgment that it violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

[Tokyo] The Foreign Ministry spokesman's explosive statement on the 6th caused a stir. It is said that at the Cabinet meeting on the 8th, Nagai questioned Hirota, leading to the issue of the Information Department Director Kawai's possible resignation. An article in the Asahi Shimbun on the morning of the 9th also criticized the statement, saying that it was tantamount to Japan admitting its aggressive behavior, inviting misunderstanding from the world and antipathy from foreign countries, and that it seemed arrogant. The Miyako Shimbun's short commentary also attacked it. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

### American Foreign Policy Abandons Isolationism

Russian Newspaper Praises Roosevelt; American Newspapers Advocate a Tough Stance Against Japan

[Moscow] Following President Roosevelt's important speech in Chicago the other day, the Soviet government's official newspaper, Izvestia, commented on it, saying, "President Roosevelt's speech is sufficient to prove that he is well aware of the brutality of the aggressors and the serious danger it poses to all countries in the world. Some of the views in President Roosevelt's speech coincide with the views and principles that the Soviet Union's diplomacy has been fighting to realize for many years. This is what Soviet public opinion should see. President Roosevelt spoke of the need to isolate the plague of aggression and the spread of war. However, it must be known that in order to implement isolation, those who are susceptible to the plague or unconsciously spread it should cooperate to take various measures to prevent it. However, in the current situation, it is difficult to effectively isolate the aggression of fascist countries, which is regrettable. For the present, the governments of all countries should not be satisfied with empty words but should take concrete actions to make a difference. President Roosevelt's speech has already made a start. As for whether he will continue to take action in the future, it remains to be seen. This kind of proposal to take concrete collective action against lawless military aggression will surely receive the support of the entire Soviet Union, which goes without saying." (TASS dispatch, 8th)

[New York] American newspapers continue to comment on President Roosevelt's foreign policy speech. The New York Daily News editorial stated, "If Roosevelt were a dictator, after issuing such a statement, he could order the mobilization of the U.S. Navy to attack Japan, preventing Japan from becoming too strong and controlling America's fate. However, what Roosevelt is saying now is merely a warning to the people, informing them of the stakes, making them aware of the possibility of American cities being bombed by Japan, and thereby realizing the need to jointly sanction Japan with other countries." The newspaper continued to argue that the U.S. Navy must be twice the size of Japan's. Finally, it added that Japan is an international outlaw, believing that the non-aggression pact and the nine-power treaty are only designed to restrict the actions of other countries, not Japan. Such a self-centered nation with no regard for others is destined to fail. The New York Times editorial stated, "If the foreign policy outline revealed by President Roosevelt in Chicago can become America's de facto foreign policy, then the Neutrality Act will have no place in the current legal framework. The essence of this new policy is nothing more than that peace-loving countries should unite in their efforts to oppose countries that disrupt international law and create a state of anarchy. The main purpose of the Neutrality Act is just the opposite, so once this new foreign policy is implemented, the Neutrality Act will have no place." The New York Daily News editorial stated, "Since President Roosevelt recognizes that the cornerstone of civilization has been endangered, and with his outstanding insight, he has indicated America's foreign policy, then our eyes cannot merely stop at empty talk without any factual manifestation." The New York Morning Post editorial advocated immediately convening Congress to abolish the Neutrality Act, as President Roosevelt's speech and the State Department's declaration both clearly indicate a dramatic change in American foreign policy. (National Telegram, 8th)

[New York] Stead, the former editor of the British Times, is currently traveling here. Reporters asked him for his opinion on President Roosevelt's speech on the 5th of this month. He replied that in the past few years, the main trend in American public opinion has been to avoid all positive international constraints and advocate a policy of absolute neutrality. The establishment of the Neutrality Act originated from this. However, regarding Europe, the nature of this law seems to be beneficial to Britain and France. Today, President Roosevelt's speech has shaken the neutrality policy. This new trend will inevitably develop more and more to the point of being irresistible. If Italy, Germany, and Japan continue to violate the fundamental ideas of the American people, then this new trend will become a reality in the shortest possible time.

### International Sense of Justice: Various Parties Call for Sanctions Against Brutal Japan

Boycott of Japanese Goods Gaining Momentum; American Citizens Demonstrate in Front of the Japanese Embassy

[London] The Minister for Coordination of Defence, Inskip, has recently received quite a few requests to find ways to deal with Japan. He responded yesterday afternoon in a speech in Stoutpington, saying in essence that the more friendly nations in Europe seek help from us, the greater our responsibility becomes. We should not rashly implement any policies that are beyond the reach of our country's power. In addition, our country should continue to improve its military equipment so that it can be in a leading position. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)

[Washington] Today, several members of anti-war and anti-fascist groups, holding flags with slogans such as "Sever Ties with Japan," "Down with Japanese Militarists," "Boycott Japanese Goods," and "Stop Japanese Aggression in China," marched to the Japanese Embassy. They intended to blockade the Japanese Embassy but were dissuaded by the police. However, the police allowed the demonstrators to deliver a declaration to the Japanese Embassy, which stated in essence, "Our boycott of Japanese goods will not stop until the Japanese government's actions are considered to conform to civilization and humanity." (National Telegram, 8th)

### Pittman Issues Proposal

⊙Airlie, USA U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman issued an article today, saying that financial and economic exclusion is the most appropriate measure that the Nine-Power Conference can pass. In this way, it will not cause a new war and can effectively eliminate the current war and prevent it from spreading. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### American Federation of Teachers Responds

⊙Chicago The American Federation of Teachers also issued a declaration today, advocating a boycott of Japanese goods, urging the people of the whole country to cooperate and adhere to principles. Vice President Astell of the association stated, "Our actions are to make the top echelons of Japan understand our hatred of war and aggression, and to let them know that we are not incapable of sanctioning them." (National Telegram, 8th)

### Edinburgh Mass Meeting

[London] A mass meeting was held in Edinburgh today. Dr. Zhang Suli (transliteration) from China gave a speech, the main point of which was that Japanese militarists have deeply imprinted the doctrine of force and conquest and the fallacy that to conquer the world, one must first conquer China, into the minds of the Japanese people. After the meeting, a motion was passed condemning Japanese aircraft and submarines for barbarically and systematically slaughtering defenseless Chinese civilians. The motion urged the British government to inform all member states of the League of Nations to use the most powerful possible economic pressure to stop Japanese aggression and to seek the closest cooperation with the United States to achieve this goal. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Swedish Trade Union Federation Declaration

⊙Stockholm, Sweden The executive committee of the Swedish Trade Union Confederation and the executive committee of the Social Democratic Party recently jointly issued a declaration with several other groups, calling on the people of the whole country to boycott Japanese goods. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)

⊙Ottawa The President of the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress, Dralebo, issued an article today, asking the Labour Party to boycott Japanese goods and asking the government to ban Canadian goods from being shipped to Japan. At the same time, the president of the Canadian Co-operative Union, Cordwell, claimed that the Union would follow the British Labour Party and the British Trades Union Congress in promoting a boycott of Japanese goods. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### British and Hong Kong Dockworkers Refuse to Load Japanese Goods

[London] Glasgow dockworkers are now awaiting an opportunity to implement a complete boycott of Japanese ships and will ask dockworkers in other ports to support this movement. The secretary of the Scottish Transport and General Workers' Union, MacLean, told a Reuters reporter today that the union has 4,000 members and is now strictly monitoring any attempts to avoid the boycott.

### Prominent Indian Industrialist Launches Fundraising Campaign

Give Us Economic Assistance

⊙Bombay Prominent Indian industrialist Sir Mody suggested today that an all-India donation be launched immediately to assist China. He stated that India has already made huge profits in its trade with China, and it is now India's duty to give back a portion of what it has earned to benefit China.

### Japanese Cabinet Establishes National Policy Deliberation Organ

Kazushige Ugaki Makes a Comeback; Will Serve as Advisor on China Policy

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe's plan to establish a national policy deliberation organ focuses not on meetings but on individual consultations. Personnel from the army and navy will be selected from preliminary candidates, and there is talk of Ugaki from the army. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

[Tokyo] According to Japanese newspapers, Prime Minister Konoe will hire General Kazushige Ugaki as an advisor on Japanese policy toward China. People in political circles believe that this move is a sign of the military gradually losing importance in the government. Not long ago, Kazushige Ugaki was a candidate for prime minister but was unable to form a cabinet due to opposition from the military. His participation in a key position now implies that the Japanese military is losing power. (Haitong dispatch, 9th)

### Japanese People Send Letters to British Newspapers for Counter-Propaganda

Accusing Us of Being an Aggressor Country; British People Angrily Refute

[Tokyo] Ietatsu Tokugawa, Kikujiro Ishii, Kakusuke Hayashi, Keishiro Matsui, Seinosuke Gō, and Eigo Fukai, six people in total, jointly sent a letter to the London Times, vehemently defending the war and aerial bombing. The original text is quite long. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

[London] Prominent figures from various sectors of Japan published a letter in the Times on the 6th of this month, claiming that China is the real aggressor country and that Japanese troops only landed after Chinese planes bombed the Shanghai concession on August 13th. The Times published several letters from readers today, refuting the claims made by the Japanese figures and pointing out that Japanese troops had already landed on August 11th, and that the so-called bombing of the Shanghai concession by Chinese planes occurred on August 14th. A letter from the famous writer Robertson Scott stated, "European countries recalling what they did in the Far East in the past should also feel ashamed, so it seems inappropriate for those countries to take the lead in condemning Japan at this moment. The Japanese people should also not be confused with their rulers." Robertson Scott further argued, "For the sake of Japan's own interests, we should refuse to supply Japan with any items that can be used for military purposes, including money, during the war." A letter from Conservative Member of Parliament Crook mentioned the incident of the killing of Japanese "puppet" officials in Tongzhou, saying that two days before the incident, 400 Chinese soldiers were slaughtered by the Japanese, which was the reason for the killing of the Japanese "puppet" officials.

### Famous Japanese Journalist Dissatisfied with the Shanghai War

Tokutomi Sohō Implies More Than He Says; The Idea of Defeating China Is Arrogant

The fact that the Shanghai war cannot be quickly resolved has caused serious repercussions in Japan. The people, under the high pressure of the warlords, dare to be angry but not to speak out. However, there is already a slight sense of dissatisfaction in the media. Tokutomi Sohō, a famous Japanese journalist, recently published an article in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun entitled "Preparing to Cope with the Worst Situation." The gist of the article is as follows: "We should observe the development of the situation and make the necessary preparations. If we hold the idea that 'the incident can be ended by defeating China,' we will be negligent in our defense and disrupt the overall plan. Will 'repelling China' be the grand finale of this incident, or the prelude to future events? It is still impossible to say for sure. If we can quickly resolve the war according to the predetermined plan and defeat China, will China sincerely repent? I am also willing to accept it with sincerity, but before it becomes a reality, we should have deep and far-reaching considerations. Therefore, we should rather regard the above idea as arrogant and recognize that the situation may deteriorate. From today onwards, we should step up our preparations, and we should have been aware of this long ago. The ancients said, 'There is plenty of room to maneuver.' Today, when using our strength, we should conserve it for tomorrow's use. The so-called strength is not only military strength but the strength of the entire nation. If we use it all up today and become breathless, exhausted, and unable to bear it, there may be new enemies appearing. The Japanese are known for their loyalty and courage, which is not something that started today. However, it is questionable whether our endurance and perseverance can safely get through the difficult times in the future. If there are those who criticize my above remarks as empty talk and alarmist, then I will have nothing to say."

### American Officials Deny Massive Military Expansion Bonds

[Washington] Foreign reports say that President Roosevelt intends to propose a military expansion plan after Congress reconvenes and advocate issuing public bonds worth $2,000,000,000 to implement the plan. Officials here have denied it, dismissing it as nonsense and saying that such a large military expansion plan would be opposed by the people. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)

### General Vasily Blyukher of the Far East (Galen)

— Qian Bohan

Recently, the headquarters of General Vasily Blyukher, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Red Army in the Far East, has moved from Boli, on the coast, to Irkutsk, outside of Baikal Lake and bordering Mongolia. What does this signify? What is the story of General Blyukher, his personal character, and his relationship with China? And what is his attitude towards Japan? Reading this article will give you a thorough understanding. If we know the personalities of great military strategists of the past and present, as well as the unique strategies that arise from their individual traits, we can understand their methods of military operation. As for the reasons for victory or defeat, Blyukher's offensive personality is one that favors striking deep into the enemy's center, but he dislikes directly confronting the enemy's front lines. This seems like a contradictory and impossible strategy. However, with modern offensive weaponry, it is absolutely possible, and something Blyukher is confident he can handle with ease. I most admire his bold words (which are not like the exaggerated, nonsensical claims of the Japanese warlords): "The lesson of Madrid is something Japanese cities dare not endure. Because Madrid is made of stone, and Japanese cities are made of wood." Therefore, we need not be saddened and indignant at the cruelty of Japanese aircraft. For although our cities are not made of stone, they are at least made of brick. We will one day see those wooden and paper cities being bombed and burned.

General Blyukher does not necessarily have to assist China. We can defend ourselves and resist aggression without necessarily relying on others to help us or avenge us. But as President Roosevelt said, this lawless plague in the international community should be immediately quarantined to prevent it from spreading and becoming a great disaster for civilized humanity worldwide. Japan is now like a dog suffering from terrible rabies and going mad. Of course, countries that consider themselves international police should all kill this mad dog. This is not necessarily to help China, but also to help themselves.

Speaking of the Soviet Union's strength in the Far East, there are now 200,000 soldiers under General Blyukher awaiting orders to advance, along with 1,100 tanks, ready to cross the border at any time. He has transported dozens of submarines from the great armaments factory in Magnitogorsk, at the western end of Siberia, to Vladivostok, and assembled and launched them in what many consider to be Japan's private sea.

As for the most important weapon—aircraft—how many are there? Perhaps no one knows the exact number except for Blyukher and the Soviet military. So when the Japanese say, "There must be at least a few hundred, right?" the mysterious Soviet General Blyukher smiles and says, "We don't need to argue. Maybe more, maybe less."

In Vladivostok alone, it is said that the Soviet Union already has several thousand fighter planes, and in addition to Vladivostok, there are three large airfields scattered throughout the Soviet Far East. When needed, Blyukher says, they can temporarily transfer forces from elsewhere, so that the number will always be greater than Japan's. But where are these aircraft's attack points?

"Of course, not necessarily on the border," Blyukher says. "They can certainly be deep inside the enemy's empire! And the lesson of Madrid is something Japanese cities dare not endure. Because Madrid is made of stone, and Japanese cities are made of wood."

Of course, if Japanese anti-aircraft guns are effective, many Soviet pilots will surely be burned to ashes. "But," Blyukher says, "Soviet pilots are prepared. The Soviet method of training pilots' physical and mental strength is similar to how Rome used to train gladiators. If we have to die, we will die willingly, so that you can enjoy the results of our deaths. The places marked with red dots are where we will die."

Blyukher can issue orders for his men to die without complaint. Because he is not a general who sits in a swivel chair and issues commands. Although he is not old, he has spent half his life on the battlefield, surviving countless battles. His bravery and achievements are beyond the reach of many. Now, I will briefly recount his past history:

We can say first that Blyukher is not an ordinary general. He is intelligent and brave, with divine foresight, good at turning defeat into victory and averting danger. He is a military genius. His swift and unpredictable movements can leave the enemy at a loss. If there were such a person in the Japanese military, he has not yet been discovered, or perhaps the Japanese military is still deeply entrenched in mediocrity. But that is unlikely. General Blyukher's reputation as a "mysterious general" has spread throughout the world. He is an old friend of our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Japan's nemesis. Fifteen years ago, he established his prestige in the Far East. At that time, although Japan wanted to take the opportunity to swallow the Far Eastern Province, its army was weak, and it retreated in disarray wherever Blyukher's banners pointed. Now that the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly urgent, the Soviet government's use of this person to intimidate the Far East undoubtedly has profound significance.

More than ten years ago, when Blyukher's army was in Shandong, some people said that he was an Austrian officer who joined the Soviet Union after 1918. Others said that he was a descendant of the Prussian generals Gebhardt and Leberecht von Blücher. These were all far-fetched stories intended to praise him. In fact, Blyukher was just the son of a farmer. His family may have been serfs of German or Russian landowners and adopted their master's surname, just as American black slaves used the surnames of their masters. Blyukher only received one and a half months of primary school education. The rest of his education was gradually supplemented informally. He is now very proud of this, feeling that he has surpassed all Japanese generals who graduated from military academies in this regard.

Blyukher's admirers say that the reason for his intelligence and competence is that he had to go out to work at a young age. When he was a child, his parents moved to the industrial center of St. Petersburg. At that time, he entered a factory. In 1910, he was a revolutionary thinker who did not belong to any secret party. He was arrested, tried, and sent to the Tsar's prison for two years and eight months for encouraging a strike in a railway factory. Later, when the European War broke out, Blyukher was conscripted into the army and sent to the front lines.

Blyukher was initially just a private, but because of his repeated victories in battles with the Germans, he earned a military armband. If he had not died in battle or been captured by the Germans, he could have been promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, which was the highest hope for a farmer's son in the Tsar's army, regardless of his genius or achievements. But as luck would have it, he was seriously injured in 1915 and considered permanently disabled, so he was discharged from the military. But this was a mistake by the Tsar's army medical officer, because in 1937, isn't Blyukher as healthy as can be?

Blyukher regained his civilian status and began working in factories again. He changed several shipyards and machine factories, while propagating his revolutionary ideas. By 1916, he had joined the Bolshevik Party, which was the last year of the party's underground secret work.

In the second half of 1917, when the October Revolution broke out, Blyukher immediately became an important figure in the Red Army in the Volga region. Because at that time, few members of the Kerensky Party had military experience, and Blyukher was a veteran and highly respected by civilians, he suddenly became the leader of the revolutionary army.

In an instant, Blyukher organized a makeshift army consisting of soldiers, workers, kulaks, and German and Austrian prisoners of war, and surprisingly, his makeshift army defeated the Cossack army of Ataman Dutov. Blyukher then led his army east, beginning his years-long march toward the rising sun. He continued eastward, farther and farther.

But between 1918 and 1919, another anti-Soviet army rose up, the Czechs and Admiral Kolchak's land forces, and began to encircle Blyukher's isolated army. Soon, Blyukher's army was surrounded on all sides. At that time, Blyukher led his men and women soldiers, rushing east and west, but all exits had been cut off.

Women, yes, because the soldiers under his command often brought their wives or lovers with them. In critical times, women also joined the front lines. Although Blyukher's army was like a trapped beast fighting desperately, the farmers in the villages they passed through, who were afraid of the White Army and hiding in cellars or hiding in haystacks, all secretly crawled out and joined his army. Blyukher also adapted to the situation, repeatedly using strategies to attack the White Army, cut off their transportation, and disrupt their rear. Finally, he led the main force to break through the encirclement and merge with the Red Army. His army had been missing for nearly a year, and everyone thought it had been wiped out. But when he returned, it had increased by 10,000 men compared to when it had departed.

Blyukher is indeed a military genius. He is never flustered. He has lightning-fast decision-making ability, able to adapt his tactics to the enemy's strategy. In 1918, he received the Order of the Red Star, the first person to receive it.

At this time, the victorious Blyukher army became the core of the newly formed 51st Division. Soon, he led the new army and continued eastward. In September 1919, he recovered Tobolsk, an important city in Siberia. Blyukher's strategy was not to directly attack the enemy's front lines. Encircling the enemy's rear was extremely dangerous but most interesting to him, so he attacked Kolchak's rear. Initially, they hid in farmers' homes, not showing their faces during the day and going out at night to attack the sleeping enemy's artillery. One day, he suddenly attacked, but it was too fast. Near the Irtysh River, his army was besieged. This time, the iron ring was very tight, and annihilation or surrender seemed inevitable.

But Blyukher always believed in his own lucky star. He used the few to defeat the many, winning by surprise, and broke through the encirclement again. Moreover, his encirclement strategy was terrible. In a feint to the east and an attack to the west, he defeated the White Army. In the months that followed, Blyukher's Red Army pursued the enemy all the way to Lake Baikal. In the spring of 1920, the well-groomed admiral was captured alive, tried, and executed by firing squad.

That autumn, Blyukher's army received an urgent order to transfer to the Crimean front to suppress the resurgence of the White Army under Baron Wrangel. In mid-October, they attacked the impregnable defenses of Perekop from the left bank of the Dnieper River. He defeated the White Army like a hot knife through butter, causing the White Army to scatter and flee to Constantinople and other foreign places. After this victory, meetings were held in various places in Moscow to celebrate. Lenin praised this mysterious general who was once a mechanic, and added many medals to him, and his 51st Division was awarded the honorary title of Perekop Division.

Blyukher turned his horse around and returned to Siberia, where he met the Japanese for the first time. At that time, Japan was using the remnants of its party to try to annex the Far Eastern Province. At this time, Blyukher recalled his first meeting with the "dwarf pirates of Honshu," saying: "Those Japanese executioners made demands of us, simply wanting to turn our Far Eastern Province into a Japanese colony." Of course, he did not agree. He immediately ordered an attack, occupied the coastal provinces, and Japan, seeing that the situation was not right, also slipped away, leaving the White Army in disarray. At the end of 1922, the Russian Far Eastern Province was dyed red.

At that time, China was a bystander with deep ties. In 1923, a young Chinese soldier returned from studying military affairs in Russia. When he passed through Vladivostok, he had a conversation with Blyukher, and they became kindred spirits. When that young military officer gained great power in his own country, he had not forgotten that Soviet general. He asked Moscow if he could borrow him. Moscow immediately agreed, and the Chinese military officer was overjoyed. His name was Chiang Kai-shek.

Blyukher came to Guangzhou, using the name Galen, which we all know. He assisted Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in establishing the Whampoa Military Academy, training many new-style military talents, and forming the mobile force during the Northern Expedition, which was able to defeat the Northern Warlords like cutting down dry weeds. Blyukher's prestige and ability reached their peak. But when the Ninghan split occurred, Borodin and other Soviet advisers gradually withdrew, and Galen Blyukher also returned to his country at this time—this was in 1927.

After Blyukher returned to his country, he served as the commander of the Red Army in the Baikal Lake area in the Far East. He liked the cold weather of northern China very much. In fact, if his army defeats Japan in the future and has to track the enemy south, his feelings will definitely not be pure joy, because he really does not like warm weather. Even when he was in Guangzhou, he once resigned and returned north, but later returned after being persuaded by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. However, these personal feelings will not prevent him from invading the enemy's deepest interior. He likes to attack the core no matter what problem he encounters. During the Northern Expedition, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek first attacked Shanghai—the financial center—because he adopted Galen's strategy. In the Second Far East War, he will definitely attack the place he considers the center.

He now comes out from time to time to inspect his army, paying attention to the economic development and offensive and defensive equipment in his area. When he comes and goes, he is always in the frost and wind, constantly reminding himself: "Now the flames of war have already lit up on our border. If the war in the Far East breaks out like a thunderbolt, we will immediately counterattack, causing the enemy to tremble and collapse. We have linked a chain of steel and cement along the border. No matter how strong your teeth are, you can't break it." Blyukher especially loves his tanks and aircraft like his children. He often says, "The time is coming for these children produced by the First Five-Year Plan to repay the motherland."

Blyukher often returns to Moscow, reiterating his views at Soviet meetings. Wherever he goes, glory always surrounds him, and representatives from all over cheer and support him. In November 1935, he was promoted to general. Karl Radek wrote an article in Izvestia praising him, saying, "When the 19th Route Army of China resisted Japan in Shanghai in 1932, shocking the world with their loyalty and bravery, even the petty-bourgeois Chinese patriots were boasting in Geneva, 'Our 19th Route Army was trained by Blyukher.'"

Recently, General Blyukher said with righteous indignation, "Japan is playing with fire in various places on our border. They have recruited many spies, murderers, Trotskyites, and all kinds of rogues." He never likes money and fame. When he was in China, he often said that he was a slave of the Chinese revolution, not its master. He now says that wherever the revolution is, it will always be his master, and he is willing to serve it to the end.

Let us wait and see what happens next.

### Celebrating National Day and All-out Resistance

— Yang Hu

Our Chinese nation has a long history of thousands of years since its founding, with a vast territory, a large population, and abundant resources. As a result, it has repeatedly aroused the covetousness of foreign tribes. Border troubles have never ceased. After the Southern Song Dynasty, due to poor human planning, the entire territory was lost. However, because of the excellent and persevering nature of our nation, it was able to restore its rivers and mountains and drive out foreign enemies after suffering humiliation. Descending to the Ming Dynasty, due to treacherous officials who misled the country and neglected military preparations, the tragedy of national subjugation was created for the first time. However, because our nation was unwilling to be humiliated, the Xinhai Revolution was finally launched, and the Republic of China was born on October 10th of the Republic's first year. This is an unprecedented great achievement in our nation's struggle, and its significance is self-evident.

Before the Republic, although our country suffered repeated turmoil and political instability, the national mood was still happy and excited every year on Double Ten Day. Unfortunately, the historical tragedy of the Japanese imperialists' ambitious aggression caused our nation to suffer great humiliation and shame in the "September 18th Incident" of the 20th year of the Republic. From then on, our Double Ten Day could only be spent with a kind of resentful and tragic mood, enduring humiliation and pain, in the face of the enemy's continuous pressure. However, the deeper our nation suffered humiliation, the more eager it was to wipe out the shame. The more oppression it encountered, the more intense its resistance. If others want to destroy us, we will never willingly perish ourselves.

The ambitious warlords of Japan, in order to satisfy their selfish desires, oppressed us more and more day by day. After the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, they seized Pingjin in one fell swoop and invaded Songhu in another, arrogating themselves as butchers and treating us like fish and meat. Although our nation loves peace, it could not but resort to resistance. The battle of "August 13th" was thus launched, and our nation's all-out resistance was implemented. Today, when our soldiers are fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy on the front lines, our National Day commemoration will no longer be spent in a dark atmosphere as before. The sound of artillery in the current resistance symbolizes the roar of a awakened sleeping lion. Our nation is using the spirit of all-out resistance to commemorate this year's National Day. Only by commemorating the National Day with the spirit of all-out national resistance can it be meaningful. At the same time, our nation should pay attention today to how to strive for national mobilization and protracted war, in order to inflict heavy damage on the enemy and achieve final victory. Only in this way can we express our sincere celebration. Therefore, first, we must adhere to and implement the policy indicated by our sole and supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, after the Lugouqiao Incident: "If it comes to the final moment, you must risk the life of the entire nation to seek the survival of the country. At that time, we will not be allowed to compromise halfway. It must be known that the conditions for compromise halfway are the conditions for complete surrender and complete destruction. The entire nation must clearly recognize the meaning of the so-called final moment. Once the final moment arrives, we can only sacrifice to the end and resist to the end. Only the determination to 'sacrifice to the end' can win the final victory. If we are hesitant and delusional about seeking temporary peace, we will plunge the nation into a place of no return." Second, we should urgently fulfill the true meaning of all-out national resistance, contributing all the manpower, financial resources, and material resources that each of us has to our country and providing assistance to our soldiers. If the ambitions of the Japanese imperialists are not quelled for a day, our resistance will not cease for a day. "Even if Chu has only three households, it is enough to destroy Qin." Even if we fight to the point where only one person and one bullet remain, we should exhaust our last strength. This is the true meaning of resistance. Third, rather than saying that we are celebrating this National Day commemoration for personal joy today, it is better to say that we are giving it greater significance for the liberation and independence of the nation and for the peace of mankind. We will use iron and blood to re-establish a foundation for national revival and create an even greater memorial day.

This is the determination and attitude that our National Day commemoration in the period of resistance should have.

### Anti-Japanese Sinology (3)

— Lin Gengbai

In my opinion, the first, second, and third points, the fourth, fifth, and sixth points, and the seventh, eighth, and ninth points each have their own connection. Only the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth are independent of each other. Therefore, they must be described separately and summarized to provide a systematic explanation.

Regarding the points to note in the first, second, and third points, life is the center. We should understand that there is a future here. Many Chinese people have a common contradiction, that is, the emotion of resisting Japan and the psychology of fearing Japan coexist. Therefore, some people with status and property often fall into a situation of inner conflict. Emotionally, they have to fight together, but intellectually, they cannot help but be invisibly terrified. But after all, their personal interests have almost merged with the interests of the nation and the country. Therefore, except for a few insane senior traitors, such as a certain secretary and a certain county magistrate recently discovered, they can still work hard within a considerable limit. However, the general small and medium-sized bourgeoisie and the proletarian vagrants are struggling in the occupational stratum, or are excluded from the occupational stratum, or have never had a career and live a wandering life. Like these people, they inevitably have a concept of personal interests that exceeds the concept of the interests of the nation and the country, and since they have a common contradiction, their only desire is to live. Usually, this desire for life cannot be satisfied, and some are even dissatisfied because of the temptation of material enjoyment in the cities. During the war, various agencies and groups reduced staff and salaries, and various factories and shops closed or reduced their scope. A countless number of vagrants suddenly appeared in society. At the same time, proletarian vagrants in China have their own special lives, such as how to help, how to meet, etc., and have always regarded the small and medium-sized bourgeoisie and the proletarian workers and peasants as the objects of their lives. During the war, these many objects lost the basis for their own lives, and the situation changed. After a long time, changes will occur. I dare not say that there are definitely no bad people mixed in, especially the prospect of prolonged war, which is a long-term concern for the general small and medium-sized bourgeoisie, and some members of the proletarian vagrants are easily transformed into a stage. During this period, self-righteous scoundrels are controlled by the contradictory consciousness of resisting Japan and fearing Japan, and become traitors, which is worrying. Not only that, but because of the war, the income of the general public is decreasing sharply, but the prices of goods on the market continue to rise, and the situation is just beginning. Production and consumption in society have become absolutely deformed, at least this can easily make unemployed people and people who feel insecure in their lives resentful due to panic, and the emotion of resisting Japan is invisibly reduced. All of these dynamics, whether they belong to the aspect of people's unemployment or the general aspect of insecure life, contain the danger of creating traitors. Another point that must be said is that although there are many reasons for the rebellion of traitors, the dominance of the peace faction throughout history and the activities of "quasi-traitors" and "Japan experts" are the direct or indirect sources of the emergence of traitors. Therefore, I hope that from today onwards, China, from top to bottom, will work hard to eliminate "quasi-traitors" and "Japan experts." This is the most fundamental and preliminary way to eliminate traitors. As for the peace faction, they should change their psychology of fearing Japan and catch up quickly to redeem themselves from the people. We must know that in the autumn of national crisis and survival, misleading the country and betraying the country are equally sinful, and the transition from misleading the country to serving the country is very easy. This is what I would like to sincerely tell my friends in the peace faction throughout history. I also hope that the central government and local governments will try their best to eliminate the motives of people's unemployment and general insecurity in life. For example, using unemployed people, allocating them to work in the front or rear, and strictly cracking down on price increases are all very necessary.

Regarding the points to note in the fourth, fifth, and sixth points, they are also closely related. Many people advocate resisting while building, which is naturally the best, but in my opinion, taking China's peacetime as an example, wartime seems to require "humility and no lofty talk," because China is still stagnating in the stage of agricultural economic organization, and the maintenance of order and system is still not as good as that of European and American countries. Therefore, China's lack of industrial social habits is the same from politics to this social aspect. People do not have the cultivation of the people of an industrial society, and they are all the same. It is the same at all times, and it can be known in wartime. But as the war is prolonged by one day, production, transportation, and other construction aspects will inevitably be hindered to some extent. Then how should we deal with this? This is indeed an important issue. I believe that we should adjust production, maintain transportation, and promote various designs for construction based on the common needs of national defense and people's lives. There is also a principle to pay attention to developing rural areas and stopping unnecessary construction in cities, as well as construction that is important but slow in efficiency or merely decorative. At the same time, attention should be paid to production aspects such as heavy industry and the supply of "food" and "clothing," and transportation aspects such as the need for "travel." In short, we should integrate urban and rural production, and even more should rural production be able to adapt to the needs of national defense and people's lives. In this way, although new-type cities that only provide consumption are destroyed, they will not affect national defense and people's lives. As for the detailed methods, due to space limitations, I will discuss them separately.

Regarding the points to note in the seventh, eighth, and ninth points, from their connection, we should make the masses and young people, as well as the domestic media, a trinity and concentrate on the basis of combining with military force. Individually, we should open up the organization of the masses and promote the anti-Japanese emotions of the general public and young people, as well as the media, and especially take the position of peacetime as the standard of attention. The most important work here is to eliminate the atmosphere of fearing Japan. In the active aspect, the government should strengthen the union of various parties and governments and incorporate them into the entire system to organize the masses and young people. In the passive aspect, the government should take effective and decisive measures to deal with the people's unemployment, the stability of general life, and the elimination of traitors, as a radical solution. As for the control of speech, it is relatively not a problem, but there are still some newspapers that have excessively faithful reports in a tangible or intangible way. I believe that this should also be banned, because in China's current situation, the fear of Japan is still a hidden reef for resisting Japan, and we are still afraid that we will not be able to eliminate it, let alone create such an atmosphere.

Regarding the tenth point, it is also very important. China has always had a drawback, that the central government and local governments restrain each other and shirk responsibility to each other. The accumulation of problems is difficult to reverse, and it is even more serious today. In fact, although the wealth of various places in China is uneven, the area and population are at least half of that of Japan. We should use this wartime to make every place a unit of resistance against Japan. Then the twenty-two provinces of mainland China are twenty-two units of resistance against Japan (including the lost provinces). Under the leadership of the central government, they will work together. This is an important matter for the authorities of each province to take responsibility for. Moreover, during the war, national taxes are reduced, and new-type cities are on the verge of bankruptcy. This is also the time for the central government to lead various localities to develop the strength of each locality through various designs. Because China's new-type transportation has not yet become widespread throughout the country, the development of localities in wartime can be free from the enemy's destruction. We can very well use the development of rural areas to replace the new-type cities that have been capitalized by the colonies. The methods will be discussed separately.

Regarding the eleventh point, we often see that countries or individual forces that have historically sent troops on expeditions far away have been defeated because their supplies were cut off by the enemy. Then this time, the Japanese imperialists' attack on North China and Shanghai, in the North China area, they have the four northeastern provinces and Tianjin as their base areas, and it is relatively difficult to cut off their supplies. However, in Shanghai, maritime transportation and the assistance of the concessions can still be disrupted. If we have a plan, the success of cutting off the enemy's supplies may not be impossible. In addition, it is also possible to plan for the division of the enemy army.

Regarding the twelfth point, since the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations, Japan has obviously failed in international propaganda. The slogan of eradicating communism is no longer enough to divert the attention of European and American capitalist countries. Moreover, in order to deal with Europe and the United States, Japan uses military force as the backing of economic competition. At the same time, it uses both military force and economic aggression against China and the Soviet Union, especially the blatant announcement of conquering China is envied by Britain and the United States. Therefore, internationally, no European and American imperialists, except Germany and Italy, want Japan to rise. The alliance between Britain and Japan has been brewing for a long time, but it has not been realized in the end, and it may not be that Japan's attempt to monopolize the Chinese market has aroused Britain's suspicion. Here we must recognize that so-called international sympathy is built on the conditions of power and interests. European and American imperialists attach far less importance and urgency to their interests in the Far East than to their interests in Europe. Then, between China and Japan, only the rise and fall of power determines the strength of their sympathy. This is a recognition that China should have. At least before the war broke out, they made the same mistake as the Japanese warlords, who suffered from China's fear of illness, thinking that China would not be able to defeat Japan. However, since the Sino-Japanese war has been deadlocked, their attitude has gradually changed. I dare to assert that as long as the Sino-Japanese war can last for one day, it will be a breakthrough for China's power for one day, and at the same time, it will be a weakening of Japan's power for one day. In other words, it can be said that China's international propaganda is beneficial to me for one day in the war. Moreover, we must be more confident that the longer the war lasts, the more China will win, even if it loses every day, it is equivalent to winning every day. This only needs to look at the Japanese imperialists' blind action this time, starting with arrogance and then with anger. Even Napoleon William would be defeated soon, let alone their eagerness to save this irreparable situation. From the recent expression of Konoe and his reply to the parliament, he has almost exposed his own weakness of not being able to fight a prolonged war. Seeing through the attitude of the Japanese imperialists to expand their pulse and debt, we should undoubtedly give them a firm blow. Our self-confidence will surely become the common belief of the international community. "Facts are the greatest eloquence." We must not give up the opportunity to win. Ah! Finally, I further and repeatedly advocate cutting off diplomatic relations between China and Japan "without declaring war."

### Songjiang

Change of Head of County Hospital

Chen Daheng, the head of the county hospital in this county, abandoned his post and neglected rescue work after the outbreak of the Shanghai war and the bombing of Songjiang by enemy planes. Last month, he was dismissed from his post and investigated by order of the province. Zhang Shaoxiu, the head of Rongcheng Hospital, was appointed to succeed him. Director Zhang has already taken over and is performing his duties.

### Wuxi

Stink Bugs Descend Like Rain

At about 9:00 p.m. on the 3rd, a large number of stink bugs suddenly flew over the sky of this county with a whirring sound. The number must have been more than hundreds of thousands. The head of the stink bugs was very small, the body was long and flat, about the size of a thumb, the color was dark brown and slightly yellow, with six legs, and the body emitted a strange smell. If a milky white liquid was released from the tail, the strange smell would be even more unbearable (the smell is similar to that of bed bugs). Residents inside and outside the city smelled this strange smell, and a large number of stink bugs descended like rain, as dense as raindrops, especially in the area of Yuantong Road, Chongan Temple, and Fuxing Road, which can be called an unprecedented strange phenomenon.

### After the Defeat, the Enemy Army Fabricates Absurd Rumors Again

Our Spokesperson Rebuts

The Japanese spokesperson said at the press conference yesterday afternoon that the Chinese army will withdraw from Shanghai in the near future. Although the reason for the withdrawal was not stated, it was said that it may be due to difficulties in food supply. The Central News Agency reporter asked our military spokesperson about this statement. He replied with a smile that this was an unfounded rumor by the enemy, which was extremely obvious. Since the enemy army invaded Shanghai for two months, it has encountered the strong resistance of our army. Five reinforcements and four general offensives have not only been fruitless, but also suffered heavy blows from our army, with extremely serious injuries, demoralized morale, and no fighting spirit. When the enemy army began its fourth general offensive at the end of last month, it actually claimed that it would drive our army to the demilitarized zone stipulated in the Songhu Armistice Agreement on Double Ten Day. Now that Double Ten Day has arrived, the enemy army's general offensive has not made any progress. The so-called prestige of the imperial army has been swept away. Therefore, in the face of the military defeat, it has no choice but to fabricate such absurd rumors, which are not worth laughing at by those in the know. Now the international community has unanimously upheld justice and imposed severe moral sanctions on the aggressors. Our frontline soldiers are becoming stronger and stronger, vowing to give the enemy army a fierce thrashing and strive for the final victory. As for the food supply, there is absolutely no problem.

### Nationwide Celebration of Double Tenth Day During the Songhu Resistance

Comforting Frontline Soldiers and Encouraging Anti-Japanese Efforts in the Rear

Today is the Double Tenth National Day, coinciding with the invasion of our country by the brutal Japanese. With full-scale resistance occurring both in the north and south, and with the hostilities in Shanghai unresolved, our frontline soldiers are engaged in fierce battles. The entire citizenry of this city, in planning commemorative activities, prioritizes increasing the strength of resistance. In addition to establishing three commemorative measures, the city's Party Headquarters is sending representatives with a large quantity of comfort items to various military hospitals to provide solace. Simultaneously, a public announcement to citizens and a letter to soldiers, elaborating on the significance of commemorating National Day, will be released. The city's Anti-Japanese Support Association has sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang and frontline soldiers expressing their respect. Other groups have also expressed their enthusiasm. Details are as follows:

City Party Headquarters of This City

Commemorative Measures

㊀ All institutions, groups, schools, factories, stores, and households must hang flags in celebration. ㊁ Responsible personnel from each institution, group, and school should, at ten o'clock this morning, lead their subordinates to hold National Day commemorations in their respective locations. They should also supervise their subordinates in purchasing national salvation bonds and donating relief funds or supplies (such as cotton clothing, cotton vests, and cotton quilts). Ordinary citizens should also donate according to their conscience. ㊂ At twelve noon today, representatives from this association will lead citizens in shouting "Long live!" three times on the radio (Long Live the Three Principles of the People! Long Live the Kuomintang of China! Long Live the Republic of China!) to express our celebration.

Sending Representatives to Comfort

All frontline soldiers in Shanghai are fighting bravely against the enemy and safeguarding the survival of the nation. This division expresses its respect for the wounded soldiers, and has specially purchased a large quantity of comfort items such as towels, handkerchiefs, gloves, and cigarettes. Special representatives have been dispatched to various military hospitals to offer condolences. The condolence group is divided into four teams, scheduled to depart at 2:30 PM today to comfort the injured soldiers at various military hospitals.

Main Points of the Announcement to the Public

Today is the Double Tenth Festival, the founding anniversary of the Republic of China, which was painstakingly achieved by revolutionary martyrs. Looking back at the past twenty-six years, because Japanese imperialism has continued to invade us, we have almost always spent this glorious Double Tenth Festival forcing a smile through a desolate scene. This year, the ferocious face of Japanese imperialism is even more exposed. However, the spirit of our compatriots nationwide is very excited, and we are not intimidated. Because we have launched a self-defensive resistance war against this brutal war of aggression. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the people of the whole country are determined to live and die with the country. Therefore, during this period of resistance against Japan, on this National Day, we should rise up and sincerely and enthusiastically celebrate, so that our enemies understand that we are 'roaring'. How can we say that celebrating this year's National Day is sincere and enthusiastic? We believe that first, we must comfort the frontline soldiers; second, we must relieve the suffering of the soldiers and civilians who have been displaced; and third, we must promote the purchase of national salvation bonds to show our determination to resist the enemy and our patriotic sincerity. In short, if each of us can do this, we will not only have celebrated the Double Tenth Festival during the period of resistance against Japan, but also wished for our ultimate victory in advance.

Message to Wounded Soldiers

Dear soldiers, this time you are bravely resisting for the sake of defending the homeland, and even more so shedding blood and being wounded for the sake of bravely resisting. This is the most glorious and splendid achievement in the history of China's revival. The people of the whole country express infinite admiration and enthusiastic sympathy. Now that you are about to regain your health, the enemy will also be gradually annihilated, and international opinion is unanimously condemning and sanctioning Japan. The final victory undoubtedly belongs to us. These are all the price of your bloodshed and the glorious rewards. Dear soldiers, today is also the National Day commemorating the founding of the country by our ancestors. We dare to offer a piece of respect and a few supplies as a gift to you today, and wish you good health.

All agencies, groups, newspapers, schools, and compatriots across the country are hereby notified: The Japanese invaders' atrocities have been condemned by friendly countries around the world, and the international boycott movement against Japan has risen like an angry tide. It is foreseen that this Japanese imperialism, with its fragile economic structure, will inevitably be swallowed up by the tide of peace and justice. We are deeply poisoned and deeply saddened. We should inflict a severe blow on the enemy's economy so that its combat power is shaken and collapses rapidly. At this critical moment of survival and honor, economic severance with Japan is the most effective weapon for the people in the rear to resist the enemy and an active manifestation of resisting to the end and vowing not to yield. This association was organized by all sectors of the city. In addition to dealing with the enemy in a practical way, please mobilize all sectors of the country to organize executive agencies for economic severance with Japan in order to implement the mission of resisting the enemy. The time is urgent, and it will be gone in a flash. Compatriots, please rise up and plan it quickly. The Shanghai Citizens' Anti-Japanese Economic Severance Committee kowtows respectfully.

### Anti-Enemy Association Suggests Severing Relations with Japan

A Central News Agency report states that the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association Presidium has recently been conducting repeated studies on the question of whether our country should declare war and sever relations with Japan. Yesterday, it was decided to first telegraph the government, requesting the recall of the ambassador and the prohibition of people from trading with the enemy. The two telegrams are recorded below:

Telegram Requesting Recall of Ambassador

(Salutations abbreviated) It is reported that our ambassador to Japan has already been subjected to invisible surveillance by the enemy, and diplomatic activities are no longer possible. Moreover, the violent aggression of Japan against our country is intensifying day by day. Apart from resisting the war, there is no diplomacy to conduct. It is proposed to recall the ambassador to Japan as soon as possible to demonstrate the government's determination to resist the war to the end. Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association respectfully submits.

Telegram Requesting Prohibition of Trade

(Salutations abbreviated) The violent Japanese are invading our territory, carrying out massive bombings, extinguishing humanity, and shocking the world. All those with blood and spirit should harbor unwavering hatred and fight the common enemy. However, this association has received repeated confidential reports that there are still unscrupulous merchants taking advantage of the situation to sell Japanese goods. Although there is an advocacy for national economic severance with Japan in this city, solely relying on social sanctions is probably not enough to chill their courage. Therefore, we specially telegraph to your council to clearly prohibit people from trading with the enemy, ensuring that during the period of resistance against the war, all financial trade and employment relationships between the enemy and ourselves are severed. Those who violate this will be severely punished according to military law. We await your urgent orders with utmost anticipation. Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association respectfully submits.

### Labor Circles' Anti-Enemy Association Cables Labor Parties to Boycott Japanese Goods

The All-China Labor Circles' Anti-Enemy National Salvation Association convened a meeting of labor union representatives yesterday afternoon and resolved: (1) To request the International Labor Party Alliance in Chicago, USA, to uphold justice and urge fellow laborers from all countries to unanimously reject Japanese goods and find ways to strictly sanction the violent and illegal acts of Japan. (2) To decide to hold a meeting at 9:00 AM on the Double Tenth Festival to express celebration. (3) To dispatch four propaganda teams on the Double Tenth Festival to intensify propaganda work. The China Seamen's Anti-Enemy Support Association also cabled seamen worldwide, urging them not to use or transport Japanese goods, it is said.

### Guangdong and Guangxi Banknotes in Circulation in Jiangsu and Shanghai

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received an order from the municipal government yesterday, forwarding regulations from the Ministry of Finance stipulating the method for Guangdong and Guangxi banknotes to circulate and be converted in Jiangsu and Shanghai. Guangdong banknotes will be converted at a fixed rate of 1.44 yuan to one yuan of legal tender, and Guangxi banknotes will be converted at a rate of one yuan of Guangxi banknotes to 0.5 yuan of legal tender. The Coastal and Yangtze River branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Farmers Bank, and Four Banks will conduct the exchange, and no higher or lower rates are allowed. The Chamber of Commerce has informed all industries to comply.

### Anti-Enemy Support Association Comforts Soldiers

And Prepares a Northern Comfort Delegation

The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association recently decided on three central tasks for the National Day, regarding comforting soldiers and wounded soldiers. It is now known that the association's initiative to solicit 200,000 cotton padded jackets has been fulfilled, and the frontline troops and the Quartermaster General have been notified to send personnel to claim them. On one hand, representatives of the association will present the frontline senior officers with a "Serving the Country with Loyalty" banner. Yesterday, it was also decided that today, the Presidium of the association, including Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Gongzhan, Tong Xingbai, Zhang Shouyong, Jin Runxiang, Ke Wuchen, Huang Renzhi, and Secretary-General Tao Baichuan, will divide into groups carrying 7,000 yuan in cash to comfort the wounded soldiers in various hospitals, giving each wounded soldier two yuan, with an accompanying note that reads, "Gladly celebrating the National Day, we have prepared a humble gift to respectfully present to the national heroes, expressing our heartfelt condolences and hoping you will accept it with a smile and remember it." Regarding the northern soldiers, the association is planning to organize a northern comfort delegation and will send a preliminary telegram of condolences today, it is said.

### Two Generals Thank Two Children for Donating Telescopes

General Zhang Fakui sent a letter yesterday thanking Mr. Pu Qiting's son, Zikang, for donating a telescope, with much praise and encouragement. General Song Xilian also sent a letter thanking seven-year-old Ying Lesun for donating a telescope, containing the words, "I saw your telescope, and it seems that I have already seen the dawn of the revival of China in the mirror. I don't need to worry about not being able to kill all the enemies, and I don't need to worry about China." He also said, "I still hope that you will exercise your body and cultivate your knowledge as soon as possible, so that you can take on your sacred task as a Chinese citizen, and also call on many children to join hands in this difficult and dangerous national fortune, and work together towards a bright future," and so on.

### A True Account of an Enemy Plane Crashing in the Countryside of Tudian Temple Township

The Enemy Air Force's Immature Technology and Erroneous Observations are Truly Laughable

Last time, an enemy plane crashed in the countryside of Tudian Temple Township, and all the newspapers in Shanghai had records, but unfortunately, they were all vague and incomplete. The process was quite meaningful and laughable. The enemy plane passed through the countryside of Tudian Temple Township and saw three farmers threshing rice in the fields. During the threshing, they moved their hands up and down, making a crackling sound. The Japanese pilot was very careful to scout everywhere, so he flew low, but somehow misunderstood and suddenly dropped a bomb. The soil in the field was moist, and the bomb entered the mud and did not explode. The enemy was angry and dropped another bomb, which still did not explode. After three consecutive bombs failed to explode, they lost interest and thought about taking off. Unexpectedly, the wing accidentally touched a tree branch, damaging the wing and causing it to descend, unable to rise. At that time, the three farmers who were threshing rice did not know what a bomb was, but they saw a long, round object like a "thermos bottle liner" floating down and did not know it was a very dangerous object. So they continued to work as usual. When the plane descended, they were all shocked. The Japanese pilots each took out double-barreled pistols and fled. The villagers dared not chase them and let them escape. After the Shanghai newspapers published the report, the enemy army immediately sent seaplanes to search and hovered in this area, and also sent warships to patrol the sea area near Haiyan to respond and prepare to rescue them, and signaled with flags. A villager saw an enemy plane coming and lay down in the field, exposing his back, which was accidentally seen by the people in the plane and mistaken for their companion, so they lowered a rope ladder from the plane, thinking of helping him up. The villager was greatly shocked. Two days later, the two Japanese were found in Yiqiao Town. The villagers did not recognize them at first, but they knew that they were the escaped Japanese pilots when they bought tofu from a tofu shop to satisfy their hunger. But when they sent the police to arrest them, they disappeared again. Only a pair of long leather boots left behind were found, so they searched everywhere but still could not find them. They tried firing a shot, but unexpectedly, the two men retaliated with a machine gun, and then they knew that they were lurking in the reeds, so they used this as a target and entered to search and arrest them. One escaped and jumped into the river, and the other was already dead. The one who was arrested was sent to Xiaoshi Hospital for treatment, but he could not be saved either. One of these two men was Major Imai, it is said.

Also, the enemy planes initially flew straight from Hangzhou Bay along the seawall to Hangzhou, but recently they suddenly changed their route and entered the inland from near Ganpu, flying over Shenfen Mountain and along the mountains to the south, and then turning west, and then along the seawall through Haining to various places in Hangzhou. Once, when passing Yujiatang Bridge, there were two boats carrying river mud, carrying river mud upwards. The mud workers had two long poles for holding their hands, and the enemy plane mistakenly thought that they were digging trenches and strafed them wildly. The enemy pilots' observations were unclear and their actions were immature, mostly similar to this. In fact, it just shows their cruelty.

### Night Rain and Autumn Chill Comforting Sent Cotton Padded Jackets

The colleagues of the Guoxin Bank once donated seven machine bicycles and sent them to the local association for forwarding to the front. It is now known that the association has also received 3,000 cotton padded jackets donated by the Guoxin Bank. Such enthusiasm is truly admirable. It is also known that the China General Edison Company also donated 100,000 anti-enemy biscuits and 5,000 cotton padded jackets, which were sent by the association for receipt and transfer.

The local association, after soliciting donations, custom-made cotton vests according to the dimensions set by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. The original price was set at 6 jiao 5 fen and a half per piece, but now it is heard that due to market prices, the cost per piece is 6 jiao 8 fen. If people from all walks of life entrust the association to handle the matter, they can send the goods at the new price.

### Lawyers Association Comforts the Eighth Route Army

The Shanghai Lawyers Association telegraphed Zhu De and Peng Dehuai, the commander and deputy commander of the Eighth Route Army, to express their condolences. The original telegram is recorded below: "To Commander Zhu and Deputy Commander Peng and all the soldiers of the Eighth Route Army in Shanxi, Your army has been ordered to kill the enemy, and you have been invincible. Good news has been frequently reported, and the whole country is rejoicing. I hope you will continue to lead your army and go straight to the enemy's lair to annihilate the ugly creatures and return our rivers and mountains. Yan and Yun are in sight. We pay our respects without end. Shanghai Lawyers Association respectfully submits."

It is heard that each grade in the school has 29 hours of classes per week, and in addition to the complete teaching of Chinese, English, mathematics, history, geography, and physics, courses such as first aid, nursing, and wartime common sense are added to facilitate the distribution of students to various rear agencies for service after school. Today is National Day, and the teachers and students of the school have raised funds to purchase and donate a large number of first aid kits for wounded soldiers to meet the needs of wounded soldiers. It is also heard that when the school proposed to raise funds, a maid of a student Yu Jinglan often donated one yuan of national currency, and her generous donation is truly commendable and praiseworthy, it is said.

### Pang Jingzhou Re-Appeals to Medical and Nursing Colleagues in Shanghai after Arriving in Beijing

Pang Jingzhou, Secretary-General of the Chinese Red Cross Society, came to Beijing from Shanghai some time ago to discuss the issue of rescuing wounded soldiers. He has now established an office in Beijing and established a large-scale wounded soldiers' hospital. It is reported that Pang Jingzhou, in order to solicit medical and nursing colleagues from Shanghai and to state his suggestion that permanent hospitals should be moved to the rear, specifically published "A Re-Appeal to Medical and Nursing Colleagues in Shanghai." The original text is excerpted below:

The national war of resistance has been going on for two months. Jingzhou is in charge of the Red Cross Society, and he only thinks that his talents are short and his responsibilities are heavy. His measures are often contrary to his wishes. However, everything within his power and what he should do has been tried one by one. Since the start of the Songhu War, the local rescue has been as urgent as a spark, so Jingzhou has been staying in Shanghai for fifty days to deal with local problems, spending most of his time, which is very detrimental to the overall plan of the Red Cross Society, which is still not thorough. Therefore, he came to Beijing on the first of this month to discuss everything with the authorities, and now fortunately he has a rough idea, so he dares to re-open each key point for my medical and nursing colleagues, (A) This war is huge in scale and will last for a long time. The general enthusiastic rescuers at sea still cannot avoid taking the old tricks of the January 28th Incident as a model, which is a big mistake, (B) Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the Puxi area is bombarded by artillery fire, so the concession is obviously the front line. It is not suitable to run a permanent hospital and unlimited shelters. This is what Jingzhou tried to shout loudly at the beginning of the Shanghai War. Later, I learned that the military's intention was the same. Therefore, in the recent ten days, taking advantage of the concession authorities' crackdown on cholera and the wounded soldiers entering the border, which was not very smooth, I made a suggestion to persuade each hospital to move as much manpower and resources as possible to the rear, (C) This suggestion and trend is very correct in terms of the current war situation and the recent concession environment. However, Jing asked the newspaper to clearly state that the central government ordered each hospital to withdraw to the rear uniformly. Some newspapers published news that they had inquired about, which was slightly different, which caused two major misunderstandings, (1) Those who enthusiastically run hospitals and hospitals that have not been established for a long time feel very unhappy when they get this news, (2) Those who are neurotic and have shallow views also involve strategic issues and make wild guesses, which is especially ridiculous. Now I specially add a statement, Jingzhou's so-called closing of each hospital refers to general sanatoriums and other original private hospitals that temporarily serve the wounded soldiers. Those hospitals have their own missions and position, so it is impossible to bother them to serve the Red Cross Society permanently in the long-term war of resistance. As for the wounded soldiers' hospitals that have been established, they have the possibility of existence, that is, to use the manpower and resources that generally cannot leave Shanghai, but it is not appropriate to increase them too much, so that most of the medical technicians are stuck in Shanghai, and we must know that even if the concession accommodates as much as possible, it will only solve a part of our wounded soldiers and contribute very little to the overall war of resistance, (D) The proportion of medical personnel in our country is not in line with the mobilization of the army. Shanghai, where civilian doctors gather, is the first to be promoted in Pingjin. Pingjin is trapped, and the colleagues are confined to the Shanghai concession. How can this be possible? This is what Jingzhou needs to sincerely explain to my colleagues, (E) The traffic on each station of Jinghu, Shanghai-Hangzhou is safe and the order is good. The enemy planes are rampant, and the rumors are too much. Our duty is to save the dying and heal the wounded. How can we give up eating because of choking? Jingzhou came to Beijing this time and experienced it personally and can frankly say to you, (F) The Red Cross Society has recently formulated a plan to expand its business, expanding the existing beds on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to 2,000, and expanding the beds on the Jinghu Road to 2,000, and establishing a large-scale hospital in the capital to accommodate 5,000 people (already arranged), and tentatively set 5,000 people in the Shanghai concession. For the North China routes, in addition to the three operating units originally in Jinpu and Pinghan, which are serving in the war zone, three more units need to be added and distributed on the Longhai Line to support them. In addition, the frontline first aid matters have been improved a lot by the military. The association's rescue and transportation work should continue to be carried out. It is also planned to add mobile first aid teams at each station and each ship pier to provide food and medicine to the wounded soldiers who arrive in port, (G) Jingzhou should sincerely ask the overseas Chinese and people from all walks of life for the funds needed in the above plan, and he has already had a considerable number of them. As for the medicines, the previous reserves are also enough for two months. However, the required technical personnel need my medical and nursing colleagues to rise up and be organized. Fortunately, the treatment has been revised recently, and the standards are higher, which is also enough for you to have a considerable living expense. If you are ready to go, Jingzhou will welcome you.

### Goods Shipped from Shanghai to Vietnam Must Go Through Disinfection Procedures

Passengers Must Also Have Certificates

The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to forward a letter from the Consulate in Saigon, based on a letter from the Saigon Health Bureau, notifying the receipt of a telegram from the Chief Inspector of Health in Hanoi regarding a health notice. It is claimed that cholera epidemics have recently been prevalent in Shanghai, and all goods transported from there must be disinfected in advance in accordance with regulations. Travelers coming from there since September 20th of this year must have a certificate of cholera vaccination, which must be six days or more and six months or less, it is said.

### Anti-Enemy Association Design Committee Continues to Handle Talent Registration

Registration Office Moved to Hartung Road

The Design Committee of the Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, in order to meet the needs of all circles in the long-term war of resistance, has specially held specialized talent registration for nearly a month. Now the temporary registration office has been moved to No. 142, Lane 3, Ci Hou Nan Li, Hartung Road (Fuxu Road). Many specialized talents from all circles have enthusiastically gone to register. Many of the registered talents have also been introduced by the association and have obtained jobs. Now, in response to the requests of specialized talents from all circles, the association has decided to continue to hold this registration. The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day.

### Measures for Relocating Goods from Zhabei

Committee Formed to Handle Matters Exclusively, Applicants Guaranteed by Guild

Since the garrison authorities announced three points to be noted regarding the relocation of goods from Zhabei, many people have inquired from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce in recent days. Here is the method announced by Yan Gesheng, Secretary of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Chamber of Commerce has been paying attention to the relocation of machinery and goods from Zhabei for half a month. However, due to the heavy procedures such as requesting and issuing passports, it has not been possible to obtain considerable results until recently. However, the current agreed method is not to issue certificates from the Chamber of Commerce and then ask the Zhabei garrison to issue passports batch by batch. Instead, the Chamber of Commerce will organize a wartime commercial goods relocation committee to handle the entire matter. The procedures are as follows: (1) All factories and shops that need to request the relocation of goods should first obtain a registration form from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and fill it in detail (private furniture will not be relocated). (2) After the registration form has been reviewed and confirmed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the original requesting shop and factory will be notified to come to the association to fill in the application form. (3) This application form is guaranteed by the trade association of each industry. (4) After receiving the application form, the Chamber of Commerce will use trucks and barges to relocate on behalf of the applicant in the order of registration. (5) When relocating, in addition to bearing the cost of renting trucks, renting boats, hiring porters, wages of escorts, and damage reserve fund, no other fees will be charged. The damage reserve fund will be kept independently. In the future, if it is not used, or if there is a surplus, the Chamber of Commerce will decide to use it as a charitable fund related to this war. (6) The Relocation Committee has now been officially established, and Ke Ganshen has been appointed as the director and Dong Zihua as the executive secretary. The staff members are all transferred from the Chamber of Commerce. For contact, the association or factories and shops can send personnel to handle directly, without the need to entrust acquaintances to transfer the request, so as to avoid malpractices. (7) The above methods will be implemented from today. If you have any questions, you can contact Xue Jianxin by phone at 97225.

### Private Shanghai Middle School Solicits National Salvation Bonds

### Cooks Donate Salary

Wu Xiaopin's Enthusiasm is Admirable

Wu Xiaopin, the chef of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank in this city, is from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province. He has served in the bank for many years. He is usually diligent and thrifty, and pays attention to national affairs, and has always been praised by the colleagues of the bank. This time, the violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, and Wu was extremely indignant. Because of the righteousness of donating money to save the country, he donated all the 50 yuan of wages given by the bank to the kitchen every month to purchase national salvation bonds. From then on, the chef's monthly wages will be borne by him personally. This kind of enthusiasm for saving the country is truly rare and valuable in the working class.

### Senji Paper Mill Loses Care

The fire brigades in various districts of Nanshi drove leather belt cars to rush to rescue. However, there were many paper materials inside, and once it caught fire, it was not easy to extinguish. Although efforts were made to rescue, the effect was not good. It took several hours to extinguish. It is estimated that all the machinery, property, and eight factory buildings were burned. The factory owner Liu Jichang, a native of Changzhou, was detained by the Xujiahui Supervision Office.

### Wartime Daily Special Issue

The Wartime Daily was very popular after it was published. This year's Double Tenth Festival, another special issue was published.

October 3rd

The fighting in Zhabei today was extremely fierce, but even by night, we still maintained our advantage.

Regarding Liuhang, after several days and nights of continuous shelling and bombing by the enemy, our front-line fortifications suffered considerable damage. Therefore, starting yesterday morning, our troops moved westward towards the Shanghai-Tai Highway. However, strong forces were still stationed along the Shenjiawan-Linjiazai line and in places like Liuhang. This morning, the troops stationed in the aforementioned areas also simultaneously retreated, taking a detour to defend the new positions west of the Shanghai-Tai Highway. Until evening, the enemy did not dare to advance rashly. Our new positions were very quiet, and the brothers who had fought fiercely for many days got ample rest.

Just tonight, in the flickering candlelight, Director Ke kindly pointed out our new positions on the map. After looking at the map, I was concerned that our positions on the south bank of the Wenzaobang would be attacked by the enemy. But he smiled and told me,

After our troops in Liuhang changed to defend the new positions, the positions on the south bank of the Wenzaobang would naturally be more vulnerable to enemy attack. Therefore, we have strengthened our forces in this area. However, if the enemy advances towards the south bank of the Wenzaobang, our army in Liuhang can attack from both sides. If the enemy advances towards Liuhang, our army on the south bank of the Wenzaobang can also attack from both sides. Under this situation, we estimate that the enemy also understands very well and will not dare to advance rashly. I felt very happy after hearing these words. I believe I can sleep peacefully tonight, even though the sound of artillery fire is still constantly ringing.

October 4th

Today, more than sixty or seventy enemy planes were dispatched, bombing the areas of Liuhang, Dachang, Jiangwan, Zhabei, Zhenru, Beixinjing, and Nanxiang, and constantly strafing downwards with machine guns from the air. The heavy sound of explosions and the crisp sound of machine guns rose and fell, one after another. However, according to reports from various lines, the enemy's fierce bombing did not cause any damage to our soldiers or fortifications. Only I was significantly affected because enemy planes were constantly circling overhead. I had to stay indoors and could not go outdoors. Not only was my daily work temporarily suspended because of this, but even going to the toilet was inconvenient. Also, our cook went out to buy vegetables in the morning, but his return was blocked by enemy planes. The meal that we usually eat at ten o'clock was delayed until after twelve o'clock before it was put into our stomachs.

Over the past two days, our positions along the Wenzaobang River were indeed attacked by the enemy, but even fiercer battles unfolded in Zhabei and Liuhang. A high-ranking officer told me that the enemy's ambition is great. They concentrated their forces, attempting to break through our Zhabei and Liuhang lines, complete a large encirclement, and surround our troops in the Jiangwan, Miaoxing, and Dachang areas. This high-ranking officer also told me various reasons why the enemy's attempt would forever remain a dream. He further said with a smile, "As a result of this enemy's reinforcement and ammunition replenishment, it is estimated that they have the strength to attack fiercely for another three or four days. After about three or four days, the enemy will again beg Tokyo for help and ammunition replenishment, and then think of other methods."

On the one hand, the war is proceeding fiercely, and on the other hand, the activities of traitors are also in direct proportion to the war here. Several traitors are caught every day. I heard that many, many of them are disciples of a big traitor from Shanghai, nicknamed Deputy Guan Wang (or perhaps Huang). They have been kept and raised for half a year, a year, or even several years. The brothers' hatred for the traitors is as bitter as their hatred for the enemy.

Today, a capable traitor was also caught in Jiangwan. He was a spy directly supported by the enemy. According to his own confession, he received orders from the enemy on September 11th, departed from Yangshupu, detoured through small roads to Dachang, and then sneaked from Dachang to Jiangwan. He was just planning to return to Shanghai from Jiangwan. This enemy spy who had penetrated deep into our rear was fortunately caught in Jiangwan. Otherwise, wouldn't many of our military secrets have been revealed to the enemy? (To be continued)

### Introductory Remarks

— Tong Xingbai

Amidst the storm of Asia, the brilliantly emerging Double Tenth National Day makes each of our emotions tense and excited. Before the sound of gunfire at the Marco Polo Bridge, the potential strength of the Chinese nation was already constantly being conceived and growing. However, the humiliation and oppression that the enemy inflicted upon us deepened year after year. This dark shadow was reflected in every Double Tenth National Day of the Republic of China. We only felt desolation and melancholy. The heart of the entire nation was like a buried explosive, brewing and waiting to be detonated. Due to contact with the ignition point, it finally exploded on August 13th under the trampling of the enemy's iron hooves.

The heroic battles of the soldiers at the front and the extensive national salvation movement of the people in the rear have combined to form a symphony that breaks through Chinese history. The gears of the era have turned towards a bright future society. This year's Double Tenth National Day, we only feel glory and place infinite hope in it. However, this hope still requires us to fight with facts to win. It is definitely not fantasy, hesitation, perfunctory attitudes, or theories that can succeed.

Since the national revolution has unfolded due to China's resolute resistance against the enemy, what is placed before us is not the boring celebration of the past, but the great mission of striving for freedom and equality. Therefore, on this year's Double Tenth National Day, we must especially promote three solid and effective movements: First, use the economic boycott movement against Japan to promote the collapse of the enemy's domestic economy, so as to affect the rapid collapse of its aggressive military force; Second, use the expanded public bond solicitation movement to build a strong national defense economic fortress; Third, use the movement to comfort the soldiers at the front to strengthen the political consciousness and fighting spirit of the soldiers at the front.

All sectors of this city have organized a Committee for Economic Boycott against Japan on the National Day, and will use the determination to persist to the end to shake the enemy's economic foundation, so that the aggressive flames of Japanese imperialism will be extinguished by the angry waves of national revolution. At the same time, the city's national salvation public bond solicitation team and the front-line soldiers' comfort team were mobilized, actively dispatching to all areas. We further hope that these three major movements can receive the response of all sectors of the country and overseas Chinese, and become a comprehensive national salvation movement on National Day, coordinating with the great comprehensive war of resistance.

### Should We Make Excuses for Not Buying National Salvation Bonds?

— Zhang Yi

Buying one more national salvation bond is adding one more point to the power of resisting the enemy. Everyone understands this principle. We, who cannot shoulder guns to kill the enemy, sit safely in the rear, hearing every day that thousands upon thousands of heroic soldiers are sacrificing their flesh and blood to fight against the enemy's artillery fire. If we are unwilling to take out even a little money to buy national salvation bonds, we will inevitably suffer the condemnation of our conscience, right? However, the more miserly a person is, the more reasons they will come up with to defend themselves. Such a mentality must be corrected.

㊀ Some people are unwilling to buy national salvation bonds because: We take out money and hand it over to the country. Is the country really using it for national salvation work? There are so many people handling it. Who can guarantee that someone won't embezzle from it, especially in this year of layoffs, salary reductions, and difficult living? In the past movement to dedicate planes to save the country, stingy people also used such a tone to refuse donations. However, since the "August 13th" War of Resistance, the facts have told us that the past donations for dedicating planes did indeed have a great effect. This time, the promotion of national salvation bonds is more thorough than before. It must be that every drop goes to the public. We should no longer maliciously doubt. We must know that excessive suspicion is a major obstacle to success. The current government is the government of resistance. Although it still has some weaknesses, it is improving every day. Now, if you harbor a distrust of the government or incite others to doubt the government, it is simply the action of a traitor.

㊁ Some people are still singing an old tune! "Saving the country requires everyone to save it. What use is it if I alone save it? If I alone don't buy national salvation bonds, will the sales of national salvation bonds be cut off?" This old saying can be refuted with just two old sayings. Since ancient times, it has been said, "The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every individual," and it also says, "Many hairs make a warm coat." May I ask, you say it doesn't matter if you alone don't buy, and he says it doesn't matter if he alone doesn't buy. If everyone says this, wouldn't the whole thing be taken apart?

㊂ Some people will reduce or eliminate their own responsibilities by blaming others. Such people will say, "Nowadays, high officials and wealthy merchants have millions and tens of millions of assets at every turn. If they are willing to take out money, it would be more and easier. Why do we poor common people have to dig into our pockets?" This statement is partly correct. Wealthy people should indeed bear more responsibility than those who have no money. The rich old men are now holding their money tightly, even buying foreign exchange and depositing it in foreign banks, which is truly hateful and killable. However, just grabbing onto the sins of others does not mean that we have no sins. We must fulfill our own responsibility before we are qualified to blame others. If we use scolding people to cover our own pockets, then it is too despicable.

㊃ The most comforting reason for one's conscience is: My finances are already tight enough, and there is no extra money to buy national salvation bonds. I don't buy national salvation bonds because I can't, not because I don't want to. Such a reason is so earnest and sincere! In fact, are we really so strapped for cash? People living in the upper-middle class can take a few percent of their monthly salary or profit as capital to buy national salvation bonds, which will not have any impact on their daily lives. At most, they will smoke a few fewer cigarillos, treat a few fewer tables of wine, and buy a few fewer bottles of perfume for their wives and young ladies. Even those who are poorer, if they are willing to run a few more steps, they can save some travel expenses every day, and eat one less dish to save some money for vegetables every day. If clothes are torn, mend them, and you can save the cost of making new clothes. Sew a pair of cloth shoes yourself, and you can save the money for leather shoes. I dare say, as long as you have the determination to save the country, there will always be a way to save money to buy bonds. People who say they don't have money and can't afford to buy national salvation bonds are ultimately unwilling, not unable. We hear news that even prisoners will give up their meals to donate money. We can't say any sufficient reason to refuse to buy national salvation bonds, right?

Dear compatriots, gentlemen, ladies, young masters, madams, young ladies, I know that you all care about national affairs. You are stretching your noses and standing on tiptoes every day, waiting for the good news of resisting the enemy. But to win battles and drive away the enemy, money is essential. You must endure some inconveniences and open your wallets! No matter what defensive reason you give to explain why you don't buy national salvation bonds, you know in your heart that your reason is insufficient. If you want to gain peace of mind, you should buy them quickly!

### Economic Boycott Against Japan

— Wang Dafu

Since the outbreak of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the war of resistance against Japan has been fully launched. However, this comprehensive war of resistance is so far limited to the military aspect. In diplomacy, although we have tried our best to expose the enemy's tyranny and cruelty, and tried our best to make it lose international sympathy and fall into isolation, we have not yet officially implemented the economic boycott against Japan, an important weapon in the comprehensive war of resistance.

Modern warfare is about the thickness of economic power and is the key to determining the outcome of the war. At present, the enemy is sparing no effort to use its greatest brute force to destroy our economic sources and damage our economy, attempting to realize its short-term dream of making our country "kneel." However, for such a serious attack, we have not given it a counterattack of the same importance as the military, weakening its combat power. In order to strive for final victory with a war of attrition, we must protect our own economic power on the one hand, and destroy the enemy's economic power on the other, so that it loses the material basis for a long-term war of aggression and is quickly defeated.

At present, the objective situation and subjective requirements are extremely urgent, and we cannot let the enemy take a breather.

Since the Japanese navy blockaded all of our coasts, our international trade has been cut off by it. Necessary imported goods and raw materials can no longer be imported, and items related to military use can no longer pass through its blockade line and be transported in. The material supply on the international level has been completely destroyed by the enemy. The drastic reduction in customs revenue is a clear proof of the Japanese pirates' sinister intentions, which is to isolate our country from the world and weaken our wartime economic power.

For two months, the enemy troops have been fighting on our vast territory, and enemy planes have been bombing our important cities and vast areas all day long, destroying countless properties and destroying countless economic power. Factories and houses, transportation and resources are all targets of the enemy's destruction. Our financial and material resources have suffered great losses. Today, we can no longer endure it and must inflict the same losses on the enemy.

The enemy's large-scale invasion and destruction in our country has aroused unprecedented indignation among the people and governments of various countries. The boycott of Japanese goods has become a unified requirement of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to sanction the violent Japan. The British Labour Party, the Liberal Party, and even the clergy have enthusiastically advocated the implementation of economic sanctions against Japan. The British Labour Party and the people of India have automatically stopped loading and unloading goods for the Japanese. American officials and civilians have expressed their willingness to participate in this sanction. As for the Soviet Union and France, they are the main forces in punishing the criminals and destroying the violent. The voices and demands for economic sanctions against Japan by various countries are growing. We should immediately implement economic boycott against Japan, on the one hand, to directly give the enemy a major blow, and on the other hand, to urge various countries to quickly expand the boycott of Japanese goods movement and quickly implement economic sanctions against Japan. Today, we have fallen behind our international friends and can no longer allow a moment of delay. We must immediately do it ourselves to win greater sympathy and greater assistance from the international community, so that our war of resistance will be more advantageous.

The above three points have proved that the enemy has blockaded and cut off our economic relations, and the demands for economic sanctions against Japan in various countries are surging. We must immediately and decisively implement the economic boycott against Japan. Therefore, the aspects of implementation are as follows:

㊀ Stop trade with Japan. So far, although our coast has been blockaded by the enemy, goods from enemy countries are still being transported to our country. We should immediately prohibit Japanese goods from landing in China, so that they cannot exploit us for a penny. Private orders for Japanese goods should be cancelled immediately, and payments should be stopped immediately for goods that have been delivered but not paid for. In areas trampled by the enemy, orders and reminders should be given to the people to refuse to buy Japanese goods.

㊁ Confiscate the enemy's assets in China. The enemy's assets in our country are no less than several hundred billion. Confiscate them, on the one hand, to deprive the enemy troops of their economic basis, and on the other hand, to use them as our country's war expenses. Japanese bank deposits, cash factories, machinery, raw materials, and commodities in China are all for our use.

㊂ Abolish debt. The debts borrowed by the enemy to invade our country are huge in number and should be immediately abolished as invalid, on the one hand, to avoid the loss of interest payments, and on the other hand, to destroy its financial resources and declare all economic privileges enjoyed by it in China due to loans invalid.

㊃ Confiscate the property of traitors. Traitors are the claws of the Japanese pirates, destroying the country and harming sovereignty, just like the enemy, and their property comes from the blood and sweat of the people exploited by the protection of the enemy. They should be immediately confiscated in full, and at the same time, large and small traitors are strictly prohibited from transporting and selling Japanese goods.

㊄ Stop working for Japan. Overseas Chinese in Japan must immediately strike and stop transportation under the general mobilization of the National Economic Boycott against Japan, so that it loses part of its working capacity and is no longer used by the enemy, harming oneself and benefiting others.

㊅ Cancel all Sino-Japanese government-private joint ventures. At present, there is no need to maintain Sino-Japanese economic cooperation relations. The existence of these relations is enough to hinder the development of a long-term and determined war of resistance. We must quickly cancel the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, Xingzhong Company, and Sino-Japanese joint ventures such as factories, mines, cotton production, and all other businesses from this year's National Day to eradicate the economic tools of the enemy's invasion of our country and strengthen the determination of all levels of the country to resist to the end.

The economic boycott against Japan must be implemented by the total mobilization of the people of the whole country. In other words, it must be done with the spirit of a comprehensive war of resistance in order to achieve practical results. At the same time, the government must immediately lead and implement this work strictly, then the blow suffered by the enemy must be very heavy.

### Front-Line Soldiers Become More Determined on Today's National Day Celebration

Continued Progress on the Zhabei and Jiangwan Front Lines Today. The Enemy Suffered Heavy Casualties Along the Wenzaobang River. The Enemy Used Poison Gas Again When Attacking Caowang Temple.

Today is the most meaningful National Day of the 26th year of the Republic of China. We are now in a comprehensive war of resistance, which has won the greatest sympathy from the world. The Songhu War of Resistance has given the enemy the most serious blow. The enemy's five reinforcements and four general offensives have been unsuccessful, and they are in a dilemma, suffering tens of thousands of casualties and countless ammunition consumption. The enemy's spokesmen have repeatedly made crazy remarks, setting deadlines for capturing our place, which is equivalent to dreaming. The continuous heavy rain has made the enemy even more embarrassed. Our loyal and brave soldiers on the front line are determined to sacrifice themselves and hold on to the solid fortifications. The enemy cannot cross our line. Today, the national flag is flying, and hundreds of millions of people are filled with shouts of killing the enemy. Under the enthusiastic celebration of the whole country, our determination to resist to the end is further strengthened. The final victory must belong to us. From last night to this afternoon, the war news on the entire front line has been relatively quiet due to the heavy rain. In Jiangwan and Zhabei, our army launched a vigorous counterattack in the National Day celebration, and the front line continued to make progress. In the area west of Luodian, including Shixianggong Temple and Caowang Temple, the enemy has failed to advance a step. Yesterday, the enemy used poison gas again, which proves that they have exhausted their tricks and their doomsday is coming. The battle in the area southwest of Liuhang and along the Wenzaobang River is still very fierce. Our army fought bloody hand-to-hand combat, killing enemies like hemp. The enemy retreated and advanced repeatedly, but we calmly responded to the battle and gave them a head-on blow. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Our positions near Guangfu Town were repeatedly attacked by the enemy and suffered heavy blows. This morning, the front line was relatively calm.

This morning, the reporter obtained news from a certain general headquarters and recorded it as follows: ㊀ In the Luodian area, our army has been operating in the area north of the Jiabao Highway Yanjiaduan for several days, and has been quite successful. The continuous overcast and rainy weather has given our army various advantages. The enemy in that area is the First and Second Regiments of the Taiwan Army. After the two night raids yesterday and the day before yesterday, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Among the hundreds of corpses left behind, many important confidential documents were seized, but it is not convenient to publish them. Among those killed by us and whose identities have been confirmed, five officers, such as Captain Chiada, Lieutenant Yamaguchi, and Petty Officers Nishihara and Arita, and Engineer Captain Butai, were found. After examining their diaries, they were mostly pessimistic about the difficulty of the war's future. ㊁ The enemy's supplies are lacking, and the morale of the army has begun to waver. The four general offensives, reinforcements, and troop rotations have not stopped. They have exhausted their skills and strength, so they have used poison gas twice near Luodian. The great sacrifices of manpower and material resources by them can be imagined. ㊂ The enemy's food and firewood have been moved away or burned in advance. Therefore, the enemy's food supply is very difficult. Also, because of the continuous fighting day and night, some have not had a full meal for several days, and they are all pessimistic about the future of the war and feel that the current situation is very difficult. Recently, we have often found enemy planes dropping food such as bread and steamed buns in front of our positions, which is enough to show the difficulty of their replenishment, but it is like a drop in the bucket and of no help. ㊃ Our front line recently captured more than a dozen soldiers of the enemy army who were from the Northeast. According to their confessions, they were only given one bread a day for their work in guiding the enemy and requisitioning materials, which was not enough to eat. According to their confessions, they came here involuntarily and deeply sympathized with our war of resistance. Some even cried relative to each other.

### Fierce Battles Along the River Southwest of Tangqiao

Several of Our Positions Were Destroyed. The Enemies That Sneaked In Have Been Surrounded.

Between Chenjiaxiang and Tangqiao, southwest of Liuhang, the battle was very fierce yesterday. Although the heavy rain continued, the enemy still fiercely attacked our Tangqiao and other areas. Enemy planes operated in the rain, and the enemy's artillery fire was concentrated on our army's positions along the Wenzaobang River southwest of Tangqiao, launching continuous bombardments. Yesterday afternoon, several of our army's positions were destroyed by them. In the evening, the enemy troops sneaked in separately at the points where they had broken through. Our army rose up to fight and immediately surrounded them. The two sides fought fiercely in a bloody battle. A fierce battle unfolded all night last night. Our brave soldiers rushed towards the enemy and attacked them fiercely. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties and retreated once. At dawn this morning, a large number of enemy troops launched an attack again, and the fierce battle started again. Our army gave them a head-on blow and besieged them. The enemies that sneaked in have been heavily besieged. The time to wipe them out is not far away, and the positions can be restored.

### The Enemy Used Poison Gas Again at Caowang Temple

Our Army Firmly Defends Its Original Positions

At the Luodian Caowang Temple, the enemy army used poison gas to attack us again yesterday. Dozens of our army soldiers were poisoned, fell into a coma, and vomited, but our army's positions remained solid and unchanged, and we were more than able to cope with everything.

### The Enemy's Attack on Guangfu Was Extremely Exhausted

Yesterday's Battle Was More Moderate Than Before. Our Army's Fortifications Are Extraordinarily Solid.

The enemy army has been fiercely attacking our army's positions in the Guangfu Town area for several days. Our army's fortifications are extraordinarily solid. The enemy has repeatedly attacked, and the deaths have been pressing into the wilderness. They have become very wary. Yesterday, the heavy rain did not stop, and the enemy troops were miserable and exhausted. Yesterday's battle was more moderate than before. It seems that they were waiting for reinforcements and support.

### The Enemy Continued to Transport Military Supplies This Morning

This morning (the 10th) at about 6 o'clock, two enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, the Nagasaki Maru and Guangde Maru, sailed in and docked at the Huishan Wharf and the Zhaoshangju North Wharf. A large number of enemy munitions, wood, and other military supplies were unloaded ashore in the rain.

### The Enemy's Airfield Was Flooded

According to people who came from Yangshupu this morning, the continuous autumn rain has led to a sudden increase in water accumulation in various places, and the airfield built by the enemy army on the open space near the Public University No. 1 Factory at the end of Yangshupu Road has been completely flooded due to excessive water accumulation and inability to discharge it. The large number of enemy planes parked in the airfield, except for a small number that were dismantled and transported to the Public University Yarn Factory and other places for parking, the rest were trapped in cement due to lack of time and could not be driven off. Therefore, the enemy army is now dispatching a large number of people to engage in towing work in order to remove the batch of enemy planes. However, the fuselages of the batch of enemy planes are all rusty and wet, and the parts are also damaged. Therefore, even if they are towed out, they must be repaired, so they cannot be driven and used until several days later.

### Enemy Warships Facing Severe Coal Shortage

Some Enemy Vessels Unable to Operate

Confirmed reports indicate that following the destruction of the Mitsui wharf, the enemy fleet's coal supply source, a large number of enemy warships anchored at Songkou and along the Huangpu River have been thrown into a panic. To date, most of the enemy warships have exhausted their fuel supplies, and resupply is impossible, rendering them unable to operate.

### National Flags Fly High in Pudong, Military and Civilian Morale Soars

The Pudong front remained largely quiet from last night until this afternoon. However, fearing an attack, enemy warships used searchlights to scan the sky and machine guns to strafe the shore intermittently until dawn. Since the August 13th Incident, Pudong has appeared desolate due to Japanese aerial and artillery bombardments, but the sudden appearance of national flags waving in the wind on National Day is truly inspiring. In addition to enthusiastic celebrations, the military and civilians have also intensified their vigilance in all positions. However, due to continuous autumn rains and inclement weather, there has been no activity on either side.

While fighting fiercely, enemy infantry swarmed up the walls. Our army commander personally led his troops in a brave counterattack, killing countless enemies. We also suffered heavy casualties. Until 1:00 AM on the 9th, the enemy continued to reinforce their troops and attack stubbornly. Because the city walls were destroyed and there was no defense to hold, we moved our main forces to new positions east of the city to continue resisting. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

### Flooding Disrupts Traffic, Enemy Troops in Difficult Situation on Tianjin-Pukou Line

Continuous Heavy Rains in Tianjin Cause Disaster; Enemy Supply Depots Flooded

[Tianjin] Due to continuous heavy rains, a disaster has occurred here. Several thousand coolies and Japanese soldiers have been building temporary embankments with sandbags along the Baihe River to prevent the flooding of Japanese military supplies and food depots. Most of the Japanese military supply and food depots are located in low-lying areas. If the river continues to rise, they will inevitably be flooded. The current river height has made it impossible for ships to pass under the bridges. (National News Agency dispatch, 9th)

[Tianjin] The Japanese troops on the left flank of the Tianjin-Pukou Line in North China are currently experiencing difficulties due to severe flooding and disrupted rear communications. Their advance has stalled. To prevent further flooding, the Japanese troops have cut off the earthen dikes near the railway at the "Tuli Hang" (transliteration). The Japanese command has stated that it is difficult to predict the extent of the losses suffered by the Japanese troops as a result. Currently, 7,000 square kilometers behind the Japanese front lines have been flooded. This flooding is due to various reasons: damage to canal sluices, continuous heavy rains, and the neglect of all waterways since the outbreak of war. The only route for the Japanese to transport troops has been temporarily blocked due to the cutting of the railway embankments. (National News dispatch, 9th)

[Nanjing] Since the outbreak of the war, our people have shared a common hatred for the enemy. All those who served the Japanese have voluntarily resigned whenever circumstances permitted. Chinese staff on Japanese ships, recognizing the importance of the ships for transportation and commerce, have resigned en masse despite the risk of unemployment. Our consulates abroad have reported multiple instances of Chinese staff on Japanese ships resigning and the assistance provided.

### Japanese Ambassador Saito Explains to the US

Japanese Telegram Transmits Contents of Conversation

[Washington] The Japanese Ambassador to the United States met with Secretary of State Hull for over 30 minutes at 3:45 PM on the 7th. Saito first stated that he felt that President Roosevelt's speech and the State Department's statement were somewhat different from previous policies and wished to hear the true intentions. Hull replied that the US's original intention had not changed, but because the League of Nations Assembly had also adopted a resolution, the US needed to make its position known regarding the global atmosphere. Saito then stated that the State Department's statement seemed to consider Japan as an aggressor and a violator of the Nine-Power Treaty, but it was difficult to accept being labeled as an aggressor. Japan's actions did not violate the three treaties. Japan was forced to take action to protect its interests in China and was facing the danger of China becoming communist. The meaning of Japan's actions was nothing more than self-defense. Saito was deeply pleased that US-Japan relations had not deteriorated since the incident, and it would not be beneficial for either country or improve the situation in China if US-Japan relations deteriorated. Japan would do its best to quickly end the fighting and sincerely hoped that the US would deeply understand Japan's position and continue to consider the matter carefully.

### Trivial Comments

— Xiang

Today is Double Tenth Day. I should write a few words of celebration. However, in this long-term war of resistance, it is unnecessary. Now I will tell a joke to serve as a celebratory appetizer.

On the Shanghai front, a soldier, having nothing to do in the trenches, gambled with his brothers. From a bad perspective, it was the brothers' bad habit. From a good perspective, it was the brothers' relaxed attitude. Unexpectedly, this soldier had bad luck. He lost every time. He had no choice but to write a note to a certain company commander. The note read:

"I have been losing heavily for days. I have no way to seek help. I have been trapped for several days. Can you lend me ten yuan so that I can make a desperate gamble?" (The original note has been published in a Western newspaper.) This note clearly said that he had been losing for several days and was borrowing ten yuan to try to recoup his losses. This kind of language is originally the cliché of Chinese gamblers using gambling as a metaphor for war. Even an eight or nine-year-old student can understand it. Assuming he was really surrounded, what would be the use of borrowing money?

Unexpectedly, this note somehow fell into the hands of the enemy and became evidence that our army was surrounded by the enemy and wanted to counterattack. The enemy regarded it as a wonderful propaganda item and sent it to a certain Western newspaper. The editor of the newspaper did not examine it carefully and actually thought it was excellent material and made a copperplate of it and published it in the newspaper.

The phrase "galloping in the literary arena" was previously translated by people as a joke about running horses in a pile of books. Unexpectedly, now the enemy regards our "soldier's toilet note" as an "international propaganda item." This is truly strange.

### Enemy Planes Repeatedly Bomb Kunshan

Inhumane Beastly Conduct

Kunshan Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, they have not gained an inch. Enemy planes are bombing everywhere, attempting to disrupt the rear. Kunshan is located between Suzhou and Shanghai. Since the outbreak of the war, enemy planes have flown to Kunshan five times to drop bombs. Houses have been destroyed, and civilians have been killed and injured. The first time was on August 24th and 25th. The main street was bombed, and houses were damaged. Most recently, at around 10:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, three enemy planes attacked and dropped eight or nine bombs in the urban area. After investigation, a newly built house in Zhou's residence in Beihou Street, Xiatang, was hit by a bomb and partially destroyed. Three bombs hit Xue's residence across from the New County Party Headquarters in front of the New County. The house was completely destroyed, and two women were killed and injured. The front door of the County Party Headquarters collapsed. Several bombs hit Nantannan Lane on Xiaoma Road outside the city, causing slight damage to houses. At 7:50 AM on the 3rd, eight enemy planes dropped 13 bombs at the train station, bombing the platform and parked vehicles, killing and injuring many innocent civilians. Again, at 6:30 AM on the 4th, one enemy plane circled over the urban area more than ten times for forty minutes, before dropping three hand-thrown bombs near the Cuiyuan oil factory outside the southeast gate, injuring three civilians.

### Henan Province's Solicitation of National Salvation Bonds May Exceed Quota of 10 Million Yuan

Specifies Solicitation Amounts for Various Industries Throughout the Province; 1 Million Yuan Has Already Been Remitted to the Central Government

Kaifeng Correspondence: Since receiving the order to solicit national salvation bonds, the Henan branch of the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee has been actively carrying out the solicitation work. It has tentatively set the solicitation amount for the entire province at 10 million yuan and has formulated solicitation standards based on this amount. In terms of business, broker, and slaughter license taxes, the local chambers of commerce are responsible for soliciting over 2.4 million yuan. In terms of land tax, the amount is collected on behalf of the counties according to the actual collection ratio, which can collect about 5 million yuan. Civil servants throughout the province subscribe on a monthly basis, which can raise more than 400,000 yuan. In terms of rent, the police bureau and county governments are responsible for collecting according to the original ratio, which can raise more than 300,000 yuan. Other major businesses, such as coal mines, flour mills, spinning mills, packing plants, egg factories, smoked tobacco, banks, and construction, have enthusiastically subscribed, which can raise about 4 million yuan. These amounts have been decided separately and are being actively raised. Wealthy households and freelancers are also very enthusiastic about subscribing, and it may be possible to exceed the quota of 10 million yuan in the future. It is planned to advance 1 million yuan to the central government first. On October 1st, 400,000 yuan was advanced from the bond funds recognized by the education production funds department, and 100,000 yuan was advanced from the bond funds recognized by civil servants, totaling 500,000 yuan. The remaining 500,000 yuan can be remitted within a day or two, and the balance can be remitted successively.

### Chinese and Foreign Banks Open Current Accounts

Foreign banks have never had the practice of Chinese banks depositing and having current accounts with each other. Although the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications joined the clearing group of foreign banks on the Bund, they used the safekeeping method to clear accounts that day, and there was no debtor-creditor relationship between them, so there was no so-called interbank exchange. Now, since the outbreak of the war, foreign banks have exceptionally opened interbank current accounts with our banks, and we have also opened accounts with foreign banks. There is now interbank exchange between us, so all our bills receivable from various banks on the Bund do not have to be collected one by one but are deposited in the foreign bank with which we have a relationship. They sympathize with each other and become a kind of agency exchange.

### Steerage Passengers Donate to Comfort Troops

When steerage passengers Mr. Wu and others of the Taikoo New Beijing ship were about to leave Shanghai and return to their hometowns, they were still concerned about the brave soldiers of Shanghai resisting the enemy. They generously donated their remaining travel funds (Wu Jiamo from Yuyao, 3 yuan; Wang Yongfu from Ningbo, 1.5 yuan; Hu Zhenzhong, 1 yuan; Hu Changchun, 1 yuan), totaling 6.5 yuan in national currency. They specially instructed the ship to forward the funds to the newspaper to send to the soldiers at the front for comfort. Although the amount is small, their sincere enthusiasm is commendable.

### Silver and Coin Shops Closed Today for National Day

Sunday Holiday to be Made Up Tomorrow; Customs and Post Office Also on Holiday

Today is National Day, and silver and coin shops are closed as usual. Today also happens to be Sunday, so the industry will have to make up for the holiday tomorrow and remain closed for another day. They will reopen on the 12th. The Jianghai Customs will also be closed all day today, suspending customs clearance. The post office will operate according to Sunday hours.

### Families Getting Married Should Save on Extravagance and Buy Grain

At this time of serious national crisis, when various places are being indiscriminately bombed by enemy artillery and aircraft, and the brave soldiers at the front are resisting the enemy and defending the country, fighting bloody battles in the border areas, risking their lives, it is therefore advised that families getting married should make one less piece of clothing, prepare one less table of wine, save on all extravagance, and buy national salvation bonds or make cotton vests to comfort the soldiers at the front and to provide relief to refugees without clothes and food, or various charitable causes, no matter how much, the more the better, which will benefit the country more.

### Bus Conductors Raise Money for Cotton Vests

Sun Shunfu, Zhao Gonghua, Chen Xiong and other conductors of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company have recently launched a cotton vest movement. In addition to raising 20.98 yuan in national currency, they are still promoting the movement through the Shanghai West Branch of the精進讀書會 War Zone Service Corps to continue soliciting donations.

### Customs Issues Special Transportation Permits for Domestically Produced Goods on Which Transshipment Tax Has Been Paid

In order to Present to Various Sub-Stations for Inspection; In Order to Prevent Double Taxation of Transshipment Tax

Jianghai Customs has issued Announcement No. 1616 regarding merchants paying transshipment tax on domestic goods and applying for special transportation permits for verification: "It has been found that the Customs has been ordered to collect provisional measures for the collection of transshipment tax on domestic goods and that all domestic postal packages must pay transshipment tax, which was announced on September 21st of this year in Announcement No. 1611 and on October 5th of this year in Announcement No. 1614. Now, in order to prevent double taxation of transshipment tax, all domestic goods, in addition to being transported in accordance with the ordinary shipping regulations, if they are transported to or through various places where customs and sub-stations are located by other routes, the merchant transporting the goods must apply to the customs where they paid the transshipment tax for a special transportation permit, that is, a Customs Transportation Permit for Domestically Produced Goods on Which Transshipment Tax Has Been Paid, and transport it with the goods for inspection along the way. Let all merchants be aware of this."

Since the Shanghai War of Resistance, enemy planes have repeatedly indiscriminately bombed our non-war zones and innocent civilians. A few days ago, several enemy planes came to the area again, dropping several bombs. The reporter rushed to the scene immediately, but the fire was still not extinguished. Several civilian houses were destroyed, and two people were killed and injured. The picture shows the people whose houses were not affected, but their houses and utensils were all destroyed, so they are all sad and unbearable to look at.

### Maritime Righteous War Ballad

— Li Ping

One, using Lu You's "Chang Ge Xing" original rhyme

A man's life is not wasted in serving his country,
His spirit surges to the Eastern Sea to slay the giant whale.
Once the evil miasma is calmed on the sea,
He must still rest his head on his weapon to reclaim Liaojing.
Brave soldiers pull tank vehicles with their hands,
And kill the enemy with ruthless blades.
A multitude of demons release smoke screens to meet them,
But a pure red heart illuminates the eyes.
The enemy is like rats, and we are like tigers,
Soldiers in the trenches fire their guns in unison.
Thousands buy silk, tens of thousands weave,
Large carts piled high with long jars.
The whirring of machines makes birds fall,
Trampling through enemy fortresses like collapsing mountains.
Alas, the sleeping lion has awakened,
His divine courage stuns the world.
For you, he shatters international dreams,
(At the international conference, they compete to listen to the sounds of Shanghai's cannons via wireless.)
Listening to the sounds of cannons in the arena of verbal combat,
Even an inch of land or a blade of grass is vowed not to be abandoned.
How magnificent is a nation with thousands of cities!

### Maritime Righteous War Ballad

— Li Ping

Two, using Lu You's "Zui Shu" original rhyme

A man's life is not wasted in this world,
Determined to exterminate the Japanese and pacify the rivers and mountains.
What are tanks and Damurs?
They are the bronze sinews and iron bones of brave men.
What good are strong armor and sharp weapons?
Ten thousand cannot match this heroic pass.
The officers and soldiers of the three armies live and die together,
Their loyal hearts serve the country with blood and potential.
Why bother to cross the sea to kill the enemy?
The Japanese slaves' heads and faces can be bought with the nation's wealth.
Iron feet, night eyes, and immortal stomachs,
(Our army's divine courage in defeating the enemy at once earned it the title of "Iron Feet, Night Eyes, and Immortal Stomachs" in domestic and foreign newspapers.)
Triumphant reports fly in, and cheers erupt.
Alas, my brave soldiers, the glory of the nation,
Punish you, Japanese warlords, you madmen!
When will the national hatred, layer upon layer, be forgotten?
The heroic souls of Yan and Huang are by my side.

War Times, Ninth Issue

### Double Tenth New Words

— Meng Mei

The glorious and brilliant National Day has arrived amidst the sounds of guns and cannons. The entire nation, while intensifying its efforts in resisting the enemy, is also contemplating ways to commemorate this glorious and brilliant festival. Thus, there is a resolution for three major movements: ㊀ Economic severance with Japan – to cut off the enemy's resources and put them to death. – ㊁ Solicitation of national salvation bonds – to enrich our treasury and enhance our strength to resist the enemy. – ㊂ Comforting the soldiers resisting the enemy – to clarify rewards and punishments, to inspire and encourage, – to boost morale and achieve the merit of annihilating the enemy.

Since our country has such determination, the glory of the National Day will certainly be fully displayed, shining with immense brilliance, and the significance of the National Day will be felt all the more profoundly!

Some say, "This festival is marked by wind and rain, a bad omen?" I say, "No - this is a sign of heaven washing armor, the enemy will flee far away; our country will ultimately achieve final victory and perpetual peace!"

The National Day falls on the Double Tenth, hence the name "Double Tenth Festival". The Shanghai pronunciation of "Double Tenth" is the same as "mourning day" and "wounding day". The poem says: "When will this sun perish? I will perish with you!" – this shows our determination to resist the enemy, preferring to be shattered jade than intact tile. The entire nation has this determination, then Japan will inevitably suffer serious injury before it is over.

"Double Tenth" is twenty. "Ten years of recuperation, ten years of education, and within twenty years, Wu was finally conquered by the strong Yue"! Our country has been humiliated by the Japanese for a long time. In recent years, thanks to the efforts of the government and leaders, the country has been unified, and national defense has been adequately prepared. Therefore, in this all-out war of resistance, "Japan" will be like Wu, destined to be conquered!

Our people's movement began with "May Fourth". May Fourth multiplied by itself is twenty. At this auspicious "Double Tenth" moment, we should follow the spirit of the past and rise up again as a whole nation to sweep away the Japanese miasma. Then next year's "Double Tenth Festival" will definitely be able to celebrate this founding and defending national day with joy and jubilation!

### Encouraging Livelihood

— Meng Mei

There is no doubt that during this war of resistance, we should not only continue production but also increase it.

Recently, the authorities in Fujian Province issued an order to all public and private factories in the province, encouraging workers to actively increase production, which is indeed an urgent task.

However, the production we need to increase is only daily necessities that stabilize people's livelihoods and military supplies that are beneficial to the war of resistance (including direct and indirect). Other consumables and luxury goods should not only not be increased, but also immediately change their style, transform the useless into the useful, and also save some extravagance to enrich the strength of resistance.
