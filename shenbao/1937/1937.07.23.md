### Our Side Complies with Agreement to Withdraw Troops, Japanese Positions Do Not Move

Instead, a Large Quantity of Military Supplies is Transported to the Front Lines; How the Future Will Unfold is Difficult to Judge

[Beiping] After China and Japan decided that both sides would withdraw troops on the morning of the 21st, the Japanese troops in the Lugouqiao, Wulidian, and Dajingcun areas should have withdrawn simultaneously. However, as of 6 PM on the 22nd, the Japanese troops showed no sign of withdrawal. They even increased the number of large and small cannons by more than twenty. A large quantity of poisonous gas was also transported to the area east of Lugouqiao. Given this situation, the future is unpredictable. (Urgent telegram from this newspaper, 1 AM on the 23rd)

[Beiping] Regarding the troop withdrawal situation at the front lines, no further reports have been received as of 6 PM this afternoon. Our special correspondent has also not returned to the city. However, it is heard that the Japanese troops have not moved from their front-line positions, and only the number of personnel in various locations has been slightly reduced. Therefore, it is still difficult to immediately determine how the future will unfold. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)

[Beiping] This morning, the reporter intended to drive out of Zhangyimen to Lugouqiao City to inspect the aftermath of the battle, due to the withdrawal of troops by both sides at the front lines. However, when arriving at the city gate, the guarding soldiers warned that most of the Japanese troops were still in the Dajingcun area, making passage difficult. They strongly discouraged going there, so the reporter returned in disappointment. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)

[Tianjin] According to reliable information from relevant sources here, the intention of the highest authorities in North China is to avoid conflict for the time being and first achieve the goal of troop withdrawal by both sides.

[Nanjing] According to a telegram from Beiping, the mutual withdrawal of one or two li by both sides on the banks of the Lugouqiao, Wanping, and Sanggan Rivers is intended to avoid the effective firing range of both sides' rifle mechanisms. It is only the first step in a ceasefire. There is still some distance to go before overall negotiation and peace. It would be a mistake to consider it one of the terms of the agreement.

[Beiping] Half a month has passed since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. Our authorities have consistently expressed a desire for peace and on the 21st, first moved the garrison troops in that area, filling the defense with Shi Yousan's troops. The Japanese troops also expressed their willingness to withdraw. The troop movement situation on the 22nd is as follows: 1. As of 5 PM on the 22nd, only a small number of infantry remained at the culvert area of the Pinghan Railway, and the main force retreated towards Fengtai. 2. The Japanese troops in the Dawayao and Guozhuangzi area moved towards Wulidian. 3. More than one hundred artillerymen of the Japanese troops in the Dajingcun area, carrying more than ten field guns, had already moved towards Fengtai on the morning of the 22nd. Chinese and Japanese troops have begun to withdraw, and all issues will be discussed at length. However, the Japanese troops stationed in the Dawayao area bombarded our army's defense area with artillery at 1:50 AM on the 22nd, with more than ten shells landing. Our side did not retaliate. Subsequently, Zhou Yongye and others, who were monitoring the troop withdrawal, questioned the Japanese troops. They replied that it was artillery cover during the withdrawal and not an attack on the Chinese side. The artillery fire then stopped immediately. At around 1 PM, heavy artillery fire came again from the Japanese defense area in Wulidian, a total of three rounds. After negotiation, the response was the same as before. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)

The second step is to continue to withdraw towards Fengtai for concentration. Zhou Yongye, Zhou Sijing, Nakajima, and Sakurai, the monitors of troop withdrawal from both sides, are still handling everything at the front. It is also heard that the Pinghan Railway is expected to be open to traffic on the afternoon of the 22nd. (Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)

### A Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Took Place at Yamenkou Yesterday Morning

[Beiping] Starting at 2 AM on the 22nd, Japanese troops from Dajingcun, Wulidian, and other places suddenly launched a fierce attack on our Yamenkou position with heavy machine guns. Our army resisted bravely. At 2:30 AM, more than one hundred Japanese troops attacked our position again. Our broadsword team also rose up to resist, and a very fierce hand-to-hand combat took place on a small earth hill southeast of Yamenkou. In less than ten minutes, the Japanese troops were defeated and retreated. Moreover, most of the Japanese troops who attacked us on the morning of the 22nd have now concentrated in Dajingcun, Xiaojingcun, Wulidian, and other places. Only about twenty people took cross-country vehicles to Fengtai. The rest have not withdrawn. Currently, the supplies for the Japanese troops in Lugouqiao and other places are still made into rice balls by Japanese prostitutes in Fengtai and transported to the Japanese troop positions. There are a total of four defense lines of Japanese troops near Lugouqiao. Last night, the Japanese troops only withdrew the infantry of the first line to the second line. Except for some of the Japanese soldiers near the railway who have withdrawn to Fengtai, the Japanese troops in the other defense lines have not moved. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)

[Beiping] Tensions in the North China situation have lasted for two weeks. Now that the Chinese and Japanese troops in the Wanping District have withdrawn, people's hearts have begun to settle down. The possibility of continued conflict between the two sides will be reduced as a result. The troop withdrawal matters of both sides will be jointly supervised and implemented by the Chinese and Japanese military committees in accordance with the agreement. The withdrawing Chinese troops are the 37th Division. The troops of that division stationed in Lugouqiao, Babao Mountain, Xiyuan, and Beiping are now all moved to various locations west of the Yongding River. The Japanese troops have withdrawn from the vicinity of Wanping to locations closer to Fengtai. The areas vacated by the withdrawal of the 37th Division are being filled by troops of the 132nd Division, which arrived from Hejian this morning. The troops of the 37th Division stationed in Beiping will be completely withdrawn by 3 PM this afternoon, boarding trains and heading to a certain location south of Baoding. Those stationed in Wanping were supposed to withdraw last night, but there was a temporary setback because the Japanese side initially agreed that they would withdraw to Xiyuan, but later changed it to withdrawing to the west of the Yongding River. The troops refused to comply and returned to their original positions, starting to dig trenches, causing tension to return to Beiping. But by this morning, everything had been compromised. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)

[Beiping] It is now learned that the 37th Division has accepted the plan to move to the west side of the Yongding River, and several detachments have already withdrawn to the north of Wanping. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)

### Wachi Flies to Tokyo to Report the Current Situation

### The Japanese Side Believes that a Full-Scale Conflict Can Be Avoided

[Tokyo] At 8 PM on the night of the 21st, news was received that the 37th Division of Feng Zhian's troops in the Babaoshan area had not yet withdrawn, and the situation became tense again for a time. Later, a report was received that they had withdrawn to Huangsi on the night of the 21st, and it was then felt here that a full-scale conflict could be avoided. The editorials of various newspapers on the morning of the 22nd are generally as follows: The Asahi Shimbun said that if the details of the agreement on the night of the 19th are fully implemented, the scope of the problem can be reduced. For the sake of China and Japan, nothing is more gratifying than this. What remains are only the two issues of Nanjing not recognizing the agreement and the central army moving north. Japan has a definite goal, and a final resolution seems to be approaching gradually, which is truly fortunate. The Nichinichi Shimbun still advocates that the roots of the expanded state of affairs should be eliminated in one fell swoop. (Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)

### Secret Observation of Lugouqiao and Wanping

[Beiping] Mentougou telephone: At 2 PM on the afternoon of the 32nd, the reporter arrived at Changxindian from Beiping to inspect. Local order is stable, and businesses are operating as usual. The defense is unusually solid. When the Japanese army shelled Lugouqiao on the night of the 20th, nine shells landed in the local city, injuring four people and killing one young girl. People's hearts are still calm. Wanping Commissioner Wang Lengzhai and Secretary Hong Dazhong have been traveling between Lugouqiao and Changxindian since the 20th, handling rear affairs. The reporter then met with Wang and Hong and inspected Lugouqiao Stone Bridge to Wanping County. The results are as follows: ㊀ The body of the stone bridge was not greatly damaged. The river beach under the bridge was hit by artillery shells, with numerous bomb craters. Fortunately, the "Lugou Xiaoyue" stone tablet at the east end of the bridge was undamaged. Entering the west gate of Wanping County, the city is under strict alert and is guarded by the Hebei security team. On the afternoon of the 20th, Japanese artillery fire was dense, and five to six hundred shells landed in the city. Civilian houses were hit, and the remaining tiles and broken walls were a scene of scorched earth. The commissioner's office and the police station were also completely destroyed. Security team soldiers and county residents were heavily injured and killed, and corpses were everywhere. The east gate tower was completely collapsed. Countless large pits were blasted on the roads connecting the east and west gates by artillery shells. The storefronts of merchants next to the bombing sites were destroyed. ㊁ Except for a part of the women and children who left the county seat after the incident occurred due to Commissioner Wang's advice, all the remaining strong men in the city remained in the city and were unwilling to leave the city. Wang provided food and distributed it to households. ㊂ The method for the withdrawal of troops between China and Japan has been considered and determined. On the 20th, our security team took over the Yamenkou and Babaoshan defenses. Before 6 PM on the 22nd, all Japanese troops in the area from east of Lugouqiao to Wulidian and Dajingcun were withdrawn to Fengtai.

### Feng Yuxiang Expresses His Opinion on the Lugouqiao Incident

The Entire Military and People of the Country Should Unite as One and Fight Resolutely for National Survival

[Guling] Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the reporter for the Central News Agency has long wanted to visit Vice Chairman Feng to listen to his opinions. Because Feng was busy with official duties, he was only able to speak freely on the 21st. Feng was energetic and stern, and he answered all inquiries earnestly. (The following is the reporter's question and Feng's answer.) (Q) What is Vice Chairman Feng's observation of the Japanese army's behavior this time? (A) The occurrence of the Lugouqiao Incident is by no means accidental. Some Japanese soldiers are fond of success and eager for credit, which is also one of the reasons for this challenge. Seeing the victory without a fight in the three northeastern provinces, they are enthusiastic about getting promoted as easily as picking up mustard seeds. Therefore, they want to repeat the old trick of September 18th in North China, forgetting the ancient training of deploying troops under strong city walls. Those who will not win will be angry and swarm like ants, killing one-third of the soldiers, but the city will not be supported. This is the disaster of attacking. I believe that there are many wise people among the Japanese people, and there are also many enlightened people in the Japanese government. If they quickly and thoroughly abandon their policy of aggression, it is still not too late to mend the fence. Otherwise, following the minority of rash people and continuing to mobilize troops and expand the situation will not only destroy the peace of East Asia and the world, but also suffer irreparable consequences themselves. (Q) What does Vice Chairman Feng know about the process of the Lugouqiao resistance? (A) As far as I know about the incident, it was not the 29th Army that provoked it. Instead, the Japanese side used the name of illegal exercises to complete their preparations for attack and then used the excuse of a missing soldier to launch a fierce attack on Lugouqiao and Wanping City, attempting to occupy them in one fell swoop to control Beiping. At that time, the soldiers guarding Lugouqiao were only a company, while the enemy concentrated three companies, artillery, and machine guns on Lugouqiao and bombarded it, causing the officers and soldiers who desperately guarded the bridge to make a tragic sacrifice. Only four of those who did not die. Our army guarding Wanping City only a part of the antique style Wenhong Regiment to speak of resisting and to recapture Lugouqiao, and then organized a commando team, using night attacks, killed and injured many enemy soldiers. In total, our casualties reached two to three hundred people, but the losses of the invaders should be greater than this. After learning the news of the war, I immediately telegraphed to the generals of the 29th Army, saying, "You are revolutionary soldiers and have the responsibility of resisting the enemy and defending the territory. You must not allow the slightest retreat in order to protect the glorious history of thousands of years. I deeply believe that the 29th Army and the people of North China are preparing to continue to make more courageous struggles and greater sacrifices to defend the country." (Q) What is Vice Chairman Feng's observation of the future of this matter? (A) The future of this matter depends entirely on whether Japan has any repentance. Our country certainly hopes for peace, but we cannot tolerate the continuation and expansion of the state of aggression, because the independence and freedom of the country are what the whole country, from top to bottom, is willing to sacrifice everything to achieve. But the officials, soldiers and civilians of North China have endured humiliation and borne heavy burdens for several years now. Their loyalty and courage are educated and historically sound, and their unanimous belief in saving the country cannot be easily abandoned. Regarding the attitude that our country's military and civilians should have, I have seen the chairman's conversation, so I will not repeat it. The entire military and people of the country should unite as one, be neither afraid nor proud, be loyal and courageous, contribute all their strength in their respective positions, and under the unified leadership of the government, resolutely fight for national survival and national recovery.

### A Visitor from Tokyo Talks About Japan's War Preparations and Anti-Chinese Sentiment

Controlled News Stimulates Public Emotion; Surveillance of Personnel at Our Country's Embassy

[Nanjing] Recently, a visitor returning from Tokyo spoke at length about various situations in Japan after the Lugouqiao Incident, which are worthy of readers' attention. I have recorded them as follows. According to the visitor, since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese side has been using every means to control speech and news. All newspapers are not allowed to publish freely. The controlling agency is the news section of the Japanese Army Ministry. The policy of control is that, except for news directly or indirectly released by the North China Garrison Army, the Kwantung Army, and the Army Ministry, no other news may be published. Important statements, declarations, or protest documents from China are even less likely to appear in Japanese newspapers. The purpose of the control is nothing more than to consistently propagate that China is provoking, that the Chinese army is large, that anti-Japanese sentiment is intense, and that China should bear full responsibility for this incident. The scope of control is not limited to newspapers. Even in films, during screenings, short, stimulating clips or slogans about the war are inserted every few scenes, in the hope of arousing the public's war sentiment and serving as a support for the military. As for Chinese students studying in Japan, especially those who are good at writing, they are often summoned by the police for questioning without any reason, and sometimes they are secretly followed by the police. Near the Chinese embassy, there are more than ten plainclothes and uniformed police officers, and two cars are parked there. Visitors to the embassy are thoroughly questioned by these police officers about their names, addresses, occupations, and the purpose of their visit, etc., which is extremely troublesome. If embassy staff go out, the cars parked near the embassy will follow closely behind, ostensibly for protection, but in reality, it is surveillance. This obliteration of the dignity and privileges of diplomats is truly an unprecedented example in the world. For example, Chen Bosheng, a reporter stationed in Tokyo for the Central News Agency, lives on the fifth floor of a certain building, and there are four police officers guarding his door. There is also a car ready to follow and investigate when Chen goes out. Visitors to Chen's residence are also subject to detailed inquiries. The atmosphere of preventing and排斥 China is so intense that overseas Chinese in Japan inevitably suffer insults from gangsters. Even Chinese female students passing through Ginza in Tokyo are subjected to such humiliations, and the police turn a blind eye. Chinese students are also unable to concentrate on their studies due to the harsh environment, and more than a thousand have returned to China one after another. One hundred and forty people returned on the American ship at the same time as me. The Japanese side's treatment of our country's diplomats and overseas Chinese in Japan is as strict as described above. On the other hand, our country's treatment of Japanese embassy staff, Japanese residents in China, and newspaper reporters is still completely free, no different from the past. This mutual contrast cannot but make people feel infinitely sigh. (Central News Agency telegram, 22nd)

Current Commentary

### General Mobilization of the Press

— Xing

At this time when the entire nation is launching a war of resistance against the enemy to save the country, it is time for a full general mobilization of the righteous press. That country which invades our territory and massacres our compatriots, its national newspapers are vigorously inspiring morale. We, the victimized people, can we lack the impassioned cries, the indignant roars? To charge and kill the enemy, to sacrifice generously, are the constant and foremost tasks of the military and the people. To arouse military spirit and inspire popular morale are the constant and foremost tasks of the press. In this extraordinary period, the government and the press should have extraordinary cooperation and effort, to expose malpractices and make contributions.

First, the national press should immediately have a close-knit organization. Based on the most pressing needs of the current national dispute, determine the common direction of work and specific implementation methods. With the enemy's blade at our chest and the enemy's sword at our head, at a time when there is no time to save oneself, the press should unanimously be the backing of the anti-enemy government. The government should provide the press with full convenience. However, under the current situation, the lack of organization in the press leads to different paths and small power. If the government wants to implement control, it is often overwhelmed, and the efficiency is not obvious. Instead, it is better to overcorrect and deviate from the original intention. To achieve effective control, it is better for the press to have its own organization and self-control. The principles and directions of control can be based on the government's intentions, and the press can be responsible for implementation and operation. In this way, internally, it can express the unanimous spirit of the entire nation against the enemy; externally, it can represent public opinion and show the world the perseverance and determination of the Chinese nation with lively speech.

Second, the conditions for the press to have power and vitality are freedom of information. A healthy public opinion comes from correct understanding, and correct understanding comes from true records. Groundless talk and numb indifference are due to ignorance of the actual situation. Accurate information is the basis for sound judgment. During the Lushan Talks, Mr. Zhang Zhirang proposed that the government should quickly improve freedom of speech and news censorship. We firmly believe that today's government does not fail to value free speech. Censoring news is an unavoidable measure because blind speech is more harmful than no speech, and baseless records are more dangerous than no records. However, censorship often takes the elimination of falsehood as the standard, preventing accurate information from reaching the public. The public can then recognize the current crisis and generate passionate feelings and patriotic actions. If certain information, such as military actions or diplomatic secrets, would be harmful to national interests if disclosed, the responsible press organizations should be informed. Although not published, if the press understands the real situation, its opinions will be more in line with current needs and will not be irrelevant.

Third, in order to safeguard the interests of the nation, the news control network should be as comprehensive as possible. The national press and the government should strictly prevent and crack down on foreign reporters and news agencies that create rumors. At this extraordinary time, international attention should be purely correct. Currently, the communications agencies, correspondents, and newspapers of Japan in China are full of malice, and those of Britain and the United States often exaggerate and make strange claims. Therefore, we should always find ways to prevent foreigners from using concessions and consular jurisdiction to roam outside the censorship network. We should also use the full power of the government and the people to crack down on or exclude foreign newspapers that spread rumors. For example, we can fundamentally refuse to publish absurd enemy communications agency drafts. Newspapers that harm our country's interests can be subject to postal suspension. On all these points, domestic newspapers should assist the government and work together.

This North China Incident is not comparable to a local event. From Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to peddlers, the entire nation is determined to rather die than surrender. We will never allow the Tanggu Agreement or the He-Umezu Agreement to be produced again today. We will never allow the tragedies of the January 28th Incident and the September 18th Incident to be re-enacted. We will no longer allow the generals guarding the three sides to be deceived by the smoke screen of peace negotiations and open the door to welcome thieves. The general mobilization of the nation's military strength, material resources, and human resources has begun, and the general mobilization of public opinion is the responsibility of the press. Provide facts so that the public can understand. Provide opinions so that the public can act. Observe clearly and be the eyes and ears of the people. Shout loudly and be the voice of the people. Otherwise, this great Chinese nation will inevitably perish in a daze and be destroyed silently. Future generations will not forgive us.

### Sino-Japanese Dispute Affects the European Situation; Britain, France, and the United States Conduct New Contacts

Eden Declares the Obligations Stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty; German Ambassador Assures the United States of Non-Interference in Sino-Japanese Affairs

[London] According to information from the Daily Telegraph, the meeting between British Foreign Secretary Eden and the French Ambassador yesterday afternoon was about the talks with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and Japanese Ambassador in the morning. Both Eden and the ambassador believed that the North China incident had reached a stage worthy of European concern and agreed to conduct new negotiations with the United States to discuss what steps to take to prevent the Far East incident from escalating further. (National Maritime Telegram, 22nd)

[London] It is learned today that Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, has requested the UK to initiate mediation in the Sino-Japanese dispute in North China. Members of the House of Commons also questioned Foreign Secretary Eden today as to whether the actions of the Japanese army in North China were considered an act of aggression. The Foreign Secretary avoided answering. (National Telegram, 21st)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently met separately with the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors to the United States. The two ambassadors informed Hull of the latest news regarding the situation in China. Afterwards, Hull told the press that the situation in North China had not produced any new elements. The State Department is now continuing its efforts to mediate with the governments of China and Japan in order to maintain peace. (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 21st)

[Washington] Republican Congressman Fish today strongly advocated in the House of Representatives that the United States withdraw all gunboats stationed in China and the army stationed in Tianjin. Fish said that if war breaks out between China and Japan, the United States should not be drawn into the vortex due to this outdated policy of stationing troops in other countries. Therefore, it is time to withdraw troops and abandon extraterritoriality. (National Telegram, 21st)

[London] British Foreign Minister Eden stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from Delegate Bevan regarding the North China issue that, except for Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty, which can be considered binding, Britain is not bound by any obligations under the treaty or the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant does not impose any obligations on Britain. Bevan asked, "Is it not a military aggression when a large number of troops from a foreign country act freely within the territory of a friendly country?" Eden refused to answer. (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram, 21st)

[London] The cabinet held a meeting this morning specifically to discuss the Far East situation. Subsequently, news was received from the Chinese side that the Sino-Japanese dispute had eased, and government officials were very satisfied, but were generally afraid that it might become tense again in the future. Official sources also said that the British government is currently maintaining close contact with the governments of France and the United States. Foreign Minister Eden also met with French Ambassador Corbin today to discuss the Far East situation. (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 21st)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden issued a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon regarding the dispute between China and Japan, stating that (if the current situation in North China remains unchanged, the British government will consider it inappropriate to engage in bilateral cooperation talks with Japan, and I have reluctantly informed the Japanese government of this view). Foreign Minister Eden subsequently met with Japanese Ambassador Yoshida and confirmed the statement he made in the House of Commons. It is reported that Eden insisted that Japan's attitude towards China was too strong and could harm the relationship between Britain and Japan. Therefore, the British government hopes that the dispute between Britain and Japan can be resolved through compromise. In addition, political figures said that Japanese Ambassador Yoshida assured Eden that Japan could not accept foreign mediation in the dispute between China and Japan. In addition, Foreign Secretary Eden's statement in the House of Commons this afternoon also stated, "As far as the current North China dispute is concerned, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Peace Pact do not stipulate that the British government has any kind of obligation, if any, it is only the article stipulated in Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty that the contracting countries should consult each other." Such an environment has now occurred. "A full and candid exchange of opinions" is now almost possible. (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 21st)

[London] Muto Jukuro, head of the Japanese economic delegation, delivered a speech at the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, hoping that peace in the Far East would not be hindered. He said, "For the sake of trade prosperity, we must have lasting peace. If peace is destroyed again, the adverse impact on trade will certainly be greater than this." He continued, Japan hopes that all tariff barriers that hinder Japanese trade will be lifted, and finally asked that the living standards of Japanese workers be improved day by day. "I believe that what Japanese workers currently regard as luxury goods will be regarded as necessities in the future." (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 21st)

[Washington] German Ambassador to the United States Dieckhoff met today with Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Welles to discuss international issues regarding the Far East situation. Although the three did not express anything after the meeting, according to reliable sources, Ambassador Dieckhoff assured the United States that Germany would not interfere in the dispute in the Far East and hoped that other countries would do the same, fearing that the war in the Far East might lead to a world war. It is reported that Hull welcomed Germany's "non-interference" policy, as this is the first time in recent years that Germany has been able to adopt the same attitude as the United States towards international crises. Before meeting with the German ambassador, Chinese Ambassador Wang Zhengting and Japanese Ambassador Saito also visited one after another to exchange the latest information on the Far East. Hull told reporters that the United States is paying close attention to the situation in all aspects and will do its best to help preserve peace if there is an opportunity. Other than that, there are no other developments. At the same time, it was officially announced here that the commander of the Japanese Embassy guard had formally apologized to the commander of the US Embassy guard for the incident on Tuesday in Beiping in which Japanese soldiers insulted an American woman. (National Telegram, 21st)

Berlin The Berlin Stock Exchange News commented on the Far East situation today, stating that some foreigners always believe that any incident that disturbs world peace must have a German conspiracy behind it. In fact, Germany only has purely commercial and legitimate purposes in the Far East and sincerely hopes that both China and Japan, which are friendly countries of Germany, will maintain peace. This has no other aspirations. As for the Anti-Communist Agreement between Japan and Germany, it is a completely separate matter. (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram, 22nd)

### London Times Says Japan's Actions Are Unjustified

A War's Outcome Holds No Profit; Even Localized Aggression Will Be Hit

[London] The London Times carried an editorial today stating that there are still three ways to resolve the conflict between China and Japan. The first is peaceful mediation, which is not impossible. The others are a fully armed war or localized military aggression. "Japan is free to choose between a major war and a minor conflict, or between tragedy and anticlimax." The newspaper added, "If Japan goes to war with China, it is best to immediately and decisively defeat the Chinese army, but this is impossible. Japan's invasion of China is also unjustified and an unprofitable attempt, because Japan's economic interests in North China are now in a precarious position. Thereafter, once war breaks out, even if it is only a localized aggression, it will be severely hit." The Times concluded, "Japan's military aggression in North China has no military, political, or economic goals that can be achieved." (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram, 22nd)

[London] The Times commented on the dispute between China and Japan, saying that Japan's attitude is at risk of losing British sympathy. "Japan has expanded a small mistake into an international crisis. Not only is the whole world surprised by it, but Japan itself is also confused. Moreover, the country should at least bear part of the responsibility for this mistake. What is the reason for this is impossible to grasp. The Chinese army is said to have acted to defend the country, and Japan is telling the world that these are all provocative actions. Countries around the world are not moved by it. Even Germany, which is difficult to form an anti-communist agreement with Japan, does not pay attention to the actions of its sister country in its newspapers. Although Britain has been paying attention to various issues in Japan with a sympathetic attitude, it is difficult to give sympathy because Japan is too nostalgic for one of the biggest problems, namely war." (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 22nd)

### Kobe British Newspaper Upholds Just Discourse

[Nanjing] The Japan Chronicle, published in Kobe, is run by British people and usually holds fair opinions. On the 14th and 15th of this month, the newspaper had editorials on the Lugouqiao Incident, which were quite insightful. We have specially excerpted and translated them below to show the general opinion of foreigners living in Japan. The editorial on the 14th first said that the news lately has been very depressing. No news is often not good news. However, since the Chinese side has no determination to attack the Japanese army in Pingjin, it can at least be speculated that it intends to resolve the situation locally. It is very willing to accept a compromise, but unfortunately, the Japanese government has failed to clearly state its true intentions. The editorial pointed out that Japan's current choices are a real war or to reach peace through negotiations, and there is no other way. The current situation is completely different from five years ago. Five years ago, the Manchurian War spread south of the Great Wall, and there was still the Tanggu Agreement to establish a demilitarized zone to stop the war. However, judging from the current mood of the Chinese government and people, it is impossible for Japan to stop military action after expelling the 29th Army from the borders of Hebei and Chahar and other places in North China. Japan can certainly use its superior military force to inflict a major blow on the resistance in North China, but this may only be the beginning of a major war, not the end of a major war. Given China's vastness, can it be completely turned into scorched earth in a matter of days? Moreover, Japan's interests are not limited to North China. If Hankou, Shanghai, and other places also need protection, then from a purely military standpoint, there will be insurmountable difficulties. Furthermore, international disputes will inevitably arise at that time. How will that be handled? The press seems to have not paid attention to this, but the government must have paid serious attention to this, no doubt. The United States and other countries have already paid serious attention to this. The development of the situation must depend on the actions of the Nanjing government in the future, but the real decision still lies with Japan. The editorial on the 15th suggested that countries should mediate according to the Nine-Power Treaty, stating that if the League of Nations still had credibility, the resolution of this crisis in North China would be very simple. Unfortunately, the League of Nations has lost its credibility after the Manchurian Incident, the Xia Gu Incident, and the Italo-Ethiopian War, so it is unable to help with this incident. However, this matter is not without room for reconciliation. The Nine-Power Treaty seems to be still applicable. This incident in North China is completely different from the Manchurian Incident in 1931. First, there is no doubt about the legal status of North China, although the Hebei-Chahar Political Council has been established. North China has always been an integral part of the Republic of China. As for whether the authority of the central government in Hebei and Chahar has reached the level desired by Nanjing since the Tanggu Agreement, it is not important. Second, the Tokyo government has no intention of treating the current conflict in Pingjin as equivalent to the Manchurian Incident in 1931. The commentary continued that Japan still has resentment towards the League of Nations' handling of the Manchurian Incident, and the major powers also have many unpleasant memories of past diplomacy. It is dangerous for China and Japan to negotiate directly, and it is difficult for countries to jointly mediate. However, although countries cannot jointly mediate, they do not necessarily have to believe that loyal advice will be effective. But this is the safest way to help the Japanese government stop its actions in North China. Moreover, Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates that when any contracting country believes that circumstances to which the treaty applies have arisen, "the contracting countries shall fully and candidly exchange views with each other." Such an environment has now occurred, and "a full and candid exchange of views" is now almost possible. (Central News Agency Telegram, 22nd)

### French Finance Minister Bonnet Explains Financial Management Steps

Saving 2.3 Billion Francs, Balancing Next Year's Budget

[Paris] According to reliable sources, the government has decided to reduce expenditures to alleviate the burden on the national treasury, with a total savings of 23,000,000,000 francs. Of this, the provisional budget will be reduced by 16,000,000,000 francs, railway expenditures will be reduced by 5,000,000,000 francs, and the remaining 2,000,000,000 francs will be supplemented by reducing the expenses of the Colonial Department and temporarily reducing the budget deficit of the Paris Market. In addition, regular national defense expenditures will reach around 9,000,000,000 francs, an increase of 1,000,000,000 francs compared to last year. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 21st)

[Paris] The Ministry of Finance recently issued a public announcement stating that the ministry has signed an agreement with the Bank of France. The current cash reserves of the Bank of France, which were valued at 0.049 grams of gold per franc after the first devaluation of the franc on September 26 last year, will now be revalued at 0.043 grams of gold. (The original gold content of the franc was 0.0655 grams. After the devaluation, the highest limit was 0.049 grams, and the lowest limit was 0.043 grams.) The resulting profit of over 6,000,000,000 francs will be allocated to the debt equalization fund. Furthermore, when the public debt equalization fund and the exchange rate equalization fund are closed in the future, all unused portions will be used to repay the loans from the Bank of France to the government. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 21st)

[Paris] Finance Minister Bonnet recently made a speech explaining the process of financial reorganization, stating that it is divided into three stages: ⑴ balancing the regular budget, ⑵ reducing provisional budget expenditures, and ⑶ establishing a French public debt equalization fund. Regarding the first item, he ordered the responsible authorities to make an accurate estimate based on a reasonable calculation to avoid accidents, and to issue substitute legal orders to save 8,000,000,000 francs, so that the 1938 budget plan is strictly balanced. Regarding the second item, the expenses for various large-scale public works, national defense expenses, railway expenses, and assistance to various provinces, cities, and towns have all been reviewed and reduced to prevent the national treasury from being overly burdened next year. In addition, the debt expenditures have also been reviewed and reduced by 16,000,000,000 to 17,000,000,000 francs. Regarding the third item, he stated that the issuing banks of European and American countries can purchase public debt in their domestic securities markets to a certain limit, or even indefinitely. In France, the public debt equalization fund does not artificially interfere with market prices, but should facilitate and regulate the circulation of public debt. As for the burden on the national treasury, he said that Central Representative Leino had estimated it to be 590,000,000,000 francs, but in reality, this number can be greatly reduced. The reasons are nothing more than the following three items: (A) National treasury income can be increased by tens of billions of francs to balance the 1938 budget plan; (B) Railway income can be increased by 2,500,000,000 francs; (C) After the adjustment of railway and highway transportation, the required expenses will also be reviewed and reduced, and the various expenditures listed in the provisional budget will also be reduced, as mentioned above. Therefore, the burden on the national treasury must be below 50,000,000,000 francs. "In short, the amount of public debt to be issued next year will be more than half less than what was estimated a few weeks ago, which can be reported to everyone."

### More Than 50 Countries of Scientists Participate in the International Geological Congress

Russian Representative Speaks on the Use of Science, It Should Benefit Mankind and Not be Used for Slaughter

[Moscow] The 17th International Geological Congress opened today at the National Conservatory of Music here. Representatives from 50 countries attended. Professor Smith of the United States delivered the opening address. Mezhlauk, Soviet Commissioner of Heavy Industry, delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Soviet government. He then proposed to elect Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, and the honorary professors present as honorary presidents. The entire audience warmly approved. After Professor Komarov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, delivered a congratulatory speech, Vice President Gubkin stood up and delivered a speech, saying, "We deeply believe that the representatives of all countries present hold the same desire, that is, to work for world peace and unanimously hate any destruction of peace and instigation of human war. Instead of using scientific achievements to overcome nature and seek welfare for all mankind, they are used to kill each other." The Congress then elected a presidium to guide all the work, and elected Professor Gubkin as chairman, the leaders of the delegations of various countries as vice-chairmen, and Academician Gorbunov as secretary-general. Gubkin then read a report on "World Oil Reserves", which attracted extraordinary attention from the audience.

According to a report in the News, Gubkin's paper on world oil reserves stated that the known oil reserves in the Soviet Union currently exceed 637,600,000 tons. However, the estimate as of January 1, 1935, was only 320,800,000 tons. In recent years, Soviet geologists have not only measured that the reserves in the old oil areas are actually larger than previously estimated, but also discovered many new oil areas, such as Bashkiria, the western foothills of the northern Ural Mountains, the Volga Province, and Central Asia, which have already begun to be exploited. The preliminary geological exploration results prove that there is also a possibility of oil reserves in Chuchukstan, western and eastern Siberia, and Yakutia. The Soviet Union's oil reserves are estimated to account for 54.8% of the world's total, and the United States accounts for 25%.

All Soviet newspapers published news about the papers of the conference. The News specifically wrote an editorial to welcome the representatives of all countries attending the conference, and elaborated on the great progress made by the Soviet Union in geology. It stated that in the 20 years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, not only have the various mineral resources discovered in the country been correctly investigated, but also countless important mineral resources have been newly discovered in the Ural Mountains, Siberia, the Caucasus, Chuchukstan, and Yakutia. The industrial life of these new mining areas has developed vigorously, supplying metals, fuels, chemicals, and building materials to the entire country. The holding of this conference in Moscow proves the increase in the authority of the Soviet scientific community internationally. All participants in the conference are world-renowned geologists. The authority and scientific value of this conference are very high. The conclusion of the discussion of various important issues will enable the progress and development of geological science and open up new paths for mankind to overcome nature.

### Soviet Report States the Arctic Ocean is Shaped Like a Bowl

The Arctic Has a Strong Warm Current, Summer Climate is at Zero Degrees, Life Discovered on the Ice

Leningrad According to Professor Shamoilov, chief professor of the All-Union Arctic Institute, summing up the work achievements of the four people, Bapatin, Clenkel, Schulakov, and Fedorov, since they started working on the Arctic ice floes, it has been one month. Although the four warriors stationed in the North Pole have not worked for long, they have made many important discoveries about the nature of the Arctic and its vicinity. We now know how deep the ocean floor near the North Pole is, so we can recognize that the Arctic Ocean is shaped like a bowl, with its deepest point near the North Pole. Previously, we did not know where the Gulf Stream of the Atlantic Ocean flowed to the north. Now we know that there is also a strong warm current of the Atlantic Ocean near the North Pole. We originally did not know where the polar ice floes drifted. Now, after 30 days of investigation, we have learned that the ice floes are drifting to the southwest, between Spitzbergen and Greenland. In the past, we could only speculate about the climate near the North Pole. Now we know for sure that the climate there is relatively warm in the summer, with the highest temperature being 0 degrees Celsius and the lowest being minus 12 degrees Celsius. The question of whether there is life in the Arctic has also been resolved. There is indeed life on the ice, because we have found birds. Of course, there must also be life under the ice. Finally, we have determined the magnitude of the Earth's magnetic force. From this, in a very short period of time, we have already discovered many extremely important scientific achievements. The daily work results of Bapatin and the other three people have allowed us to obtain quite important discoveries. Their experience, their self-consciousness, and the talents of the two young scientists, Schulakov and Fedorov, can guarantee that all observations must be exceptionally thorough, and this kind of observation is carried out under extremely unusual conditions with great sacrifice.

### Soviet Purge

Radio Stations and Newspapers Without Money Are First Reported

[Moscow] The editorial staff of the Truth newspaper in Kursk, an important provincial capital, has been arrested. It is believed that the arrested editors are accused of obstructing the government's policies. (National Maritime Telecommunications, 22nd)

[Moscow] The Central Committee of the Communist Party recently expelled Gu Lik, chairman of the Radio Broadcasting Committee of the Ukrainian Republic, from the party and dismissed him from his post. Many other officials of the committee have also been dismissed. It is said that Gu Lik was punished because he failed to eliminate the reactionary elements in the Radio Broadcasting Committee and included counter-revolutionary propaganda in the broadcasting items. According to the Communist Party's organ newspaper Truth, the Radio Broadcasting Committee of the Ukrainian Republic had been attacked several times. When Zinoviev and Kamenev were sentenced to death last year, the radio stations in the region immediately broadcast funeral marches after announcing the news, which was inappropriate.

### German Submarine Peeks at British Naval Exercise

Navy Corrects News

London Various newspapers published news saying that a British destroyer, the HMS Whirlwind, was conducting an exercise on the sea surface inside Portland Port on the 19th of this month, when a German submarine was found passing nearby. The HMS Whirlwind forced the submarine to surface. The Navy specially issued a public statement correcting the above news, saying that when the British destroyers HMS Whirlwind, HMS Walpole, and the submarine HMS Spearfish were exercising on the sea surface of Portland Port, the HMS Walpole glimpsed an unidentified submarine surfacing and sailing east. The British warships immediately stopped the exercise, and the HMS Spearfish was ordered to surface and record the number marked on the conning tower of the unidentified submarine, which was No. 34. Therefore, it was determined that the submarine was a German submarine that had sailed through the English Channel back to Germany. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 21st)

[London] Regarding rumors that a British destroyer discovered a German submarine in the English Channel on Monday, Foreign Secretary Eden and Naval Secretary Cooper both issued statements today, strongly denying it. (National Maritime Telecommunications, 21st)

### Japanese Special Parliament Opens Today

Emergency Situation in China, No Party Will Voice Strong Opposition

[Nanjing] The first 71st Special Parliament of the Kinoshita Cabinet will be convened on the 23rd amidst the dangerous situation in North China and the atmosphere of urgency. In order to prepare for various matters, the various factions of the House of Representatives have convened general meetings of their members from the 21st to the 22nd to decide on their attitude towards attending the special parliament. The various parties believe that at this time of emergency in North China, they should overcome the situation with a united national front, conduct parliamentary affairs with a spirit of cooperation, and provide strong assistance to the government. The power of the various parties in the House of Peers and the House of Representatives is roughly as follows:

House of Peers: Imperial Family 18, Research Society 163, Justice Society 66, Tuesday Society 42, Koyu Club 35, Dowakai 34, Doseikai 12, Independents 32, Vacancies 3, Total 397, plus 18 members of the Imperial Family.

House of Representatives: Minseito 180, Seiyukai 174, First Members Club (Showa Society, National League, Political Reform League) 48, Akikai 36, Second Club 13, Toho Kai 11, Independents 4, Total 466. (Domei News Agency, 22nd)

[Tokyo] Ando Kozo, a representative elected from Aichi Prefecture, flew his own plane from Nagoya to Tokyo on the morning of the 22nd to attend the special parliament. (Domei News Agency, 22nd)

[Tokyo] After the North China Incident, the Japanese army paid for expenses mostly using Bank of Korea banknotes, so their issuance must have increased. The Ministry of Finance fears that limiting the issuance will become permanent, and plans to expand the current guaranteed issuance limit. They are currently discussing this with the Bank of Korea. If they obtain an amendment to the Bank of Korea Act, they will submit a request for approval to the special parliament. (Domei News Agency, 22nd)

### Britain Plans to Break Deadlock in Spanish Problem

Eden Meets with British and Italian Ambassadors, Plans to Establish Three Committees for Discussion

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden today resumed talks with the French and Italian fire envoys to discuss the implementation procedures of the British compromise plan on non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. The British side hopes to convene a subcommittee meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee again on Friday, but the date has not been determined until the reasons for the Italian side's insistence are confirmed. If the dispute on the Italian side is of a certain nature, then the current difficulties will be difficult to break. Furthermore, the British side also expressed that its patience is not unlimited. The British side is still unable to prove whether the Italian side is willing to create a rupture over the priority of procedures, or whether it is only using it to delay the matter in order to avoid the serious juncture in the issue of withdrawing volunteer soldiers. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 21st)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden separately met with the French and Italian ambassadors today to discuss the current deadlock in the non-intervention plan for the Spanish civil war. It is said that the talks did not result in any progress. The positions of the two sides are fundamentally opposed. The British and French sides maintain the original method of the British compromise plan, advocating that foreign volunteer soldiers in Spain should be withdrawn first, and then the two parties involved in the civil war should be recognized as belligerent entities. The Italian side insists on the opinions put forward by the subcommittee yesterday morning and rejects the British and French proposals. Therefore, the general public is deeply afraid that the situation will be the same as on the day of the meeting of the subcommittee of the Coordinating Committee on the 23rd of this month, and that Germany and Italy may require Britain and France to stop naval surveillance in the sea areas under the jurisdiction of the Spanish National Army. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 21st)

[London] The House of Commons met today, and Liberal MP Mandel asked whether there was a deadline for the British compromise plan on non-intervention in the Spanish civil war to be submitted to the Coordinating Committee for discussion. Eden said, "The British government cannot agree to any method of delaying the discussion. This has been clearly stated by Plymouth, Chairman of the Coordinating Committee, Secretary of Foreign Affairs." (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 21st)

[London] Well-informed sources recently stated that Foreign Secretary Eden had proposed to Italian Ambassador Grandi yesterday to organize three shareholder committees: ⑴ a shareholder committee for the inspection plan for Spanish ports; ⑵ a shareholder committee for the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from Spain; ⑶ a shareholder committee for the recognition of the two parties involved in the Spanish civil war as belligerent entities. He also advocated immediately contacting the two parties involved in the Spanish civil war. However, the attitude of the Italian government is still unknown, so the subcommittee of the Coordinating Committee may not be able to meet as scheduled tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 22nd)

[London] The subcommittee of the Coordinating Committee for the non-intervention plan in the Spanish civil war appointed a technical shareholder committee yesterday to draft a plan for the inspection of Spanish ports. The shareholder committee is scheduled to meet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11 am tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 22nd)

[Paris] French officials recently stated that the French government has not changed its original position on the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. That is, the French government is prepared to endorse any procedure that resolves the current deadlock. However, France firmly insists that the main points of the British compromise plan must be respected. Therefore, the issue of withdrawing foreign volunteer soldiers in Spain cannot be resolved one day, and the belligerent group in the civil war cannot be recognized one day. In addition, officials also criticized Italy's tough attitude, saying that when the British compromise plan was announced, Rome warmly praised it, saying it was a victory for Germany and Italy. Now Italy's position is contrary to this. How can such a contradictory situation occur? It is also possible that Italy's attitude is due to France's adoption of a compromise position. In the past, France opposed recognizing the two parties involved in the Spanish civil war as belligerent entities, believing that this would be a source of permanent international disputes. However, later France once made a concession and agreed to recognize the belligerent group in the civil war after all volunteer soldiers were withdrawn. It is also possible that Italy is taking a tough stance now because France has expressed its recognition and is taking a step forward. As for the fact that the British and French navies have implemented inspection of the sea surface in the Spanish National Army's claimed sea area, officials believe that France insists that neutral inspectors must inspect the Spanish ports in accordance with the provisions of the British compromise plan before the sea surface inspection system can be completely abolished.

### The Philippines is Wary of Japanese Aggression

Quezon Says Independence is Not a Solution, But the US Has Not Changed its Position

[New York] Philippine President Quezon left here yesterday for San Francisco to take a boat back home. Before leaving, he gave an interview to the World Telegram, indirectly stating that immediate independence for the Philippines may not be the best solution to the US-Philippine problem. He hopes that the US Congress will discuss the bill during this transition period to allow the Philippines to remain under US protection. The newspaper believes that Quezon, when elected president, took complete independence for the Philippines as his political platform. This change is noteworthy. A special correspondent interviewed various senators to seek their reactions to this. Quinton, one of the proposers of the Philippine Independence Act, actually said that he did not want to express his opinion before the Mixed Committee's discussion. Only he himself is more in favor of the Philippines achieving complete independence as soon as possible. Vandenburg said that he agreed with President Quezon's statement that the current situation is unbearable. The Far East is like a powder keg. We are in the midst of it, with responsibility but no power. But today, there is no turning back. We should make the Philippines completely independent as soon as possible. The newspaper also carried a commentary saying that President Quezon's change of position is courageous and demonstrates statesmanship. Since the Japanese army invaded Manchuria on the night of September 18, 1931, creating a puppet state, the international treaties that the village issued are equal to waste paper. Philippine independence was originally expected to obtain international guarantees. Today, the military is again noisy in the fight in Beiping, which proves that collective security has become a bubble for weak countries in East Asia. The leaders of the Philippine decoration do not dare to tell the people directly about these facts, not to mention the economic issues. (National Society Telegraph, 21st)

### Palestine Problem, British Discussion Concludes

No Immediate Definitive Resolution; Report to be Submitted to League of Nations Committee

[London] The British House of Commons debate on the Palestine issue has concluded. The Palestine White Paper will be submitted to the League of Nations Mandates Commission in Geneva on July 30th. (July 22nd, Kuomin News Agency Telegraph)

[London] The British House of Commons has decided to postpone a definitive resolution on the Palestine partition plan. After lengthy discussion, the House passed a motion stating that all proposals regarding Palestine contained in the White Paper should first be submitted to the League of Nations, so that the British government, after thorough investigation, may carefully examine each proposal in the White Paper and draft a comprehensive plan for submission to Parliament. This debate was initiated by Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore, who first requested the House of Lords to approve the proposal and urged all members to carefully consider their words, as the debate would be closely watched by Jews and Muslims worldwide. The Colonial Secretary stated firmly that the British government had never promised to grant the land west of the Jordan River in Palestine to the Grand Mufti. Although the independence of Arab nations had been promoted, the Balfour Declaration only promised to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine, not to make all of Palestine a Jewish state. During the European War, the British suffered tens of thousands of casualties in Palestine, and many more in Iraq. If Britain had not made these sacrifices, how could the Arab independent states have emerged in the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Transjordan, and a large part of Palestine? This is something the Arabs should recognize. Regarding the provisions of the Mandate concerning education and the promotion of self-governance, he felt that these provisions were impractical and only served to widen the gap between Arabs and Jews. The British government is well aware that the continuation of this Mandate system cannot satisfy the hopes of either the Jews or the Arabs. Only partition can realize the ideals of both sides, as both sides fundamentally distrust being ruled by the other. There is no way to remove their doubts other than partitioning Palestine. Some have argued that the Palestine problem is economic in nature or caused by administrative failures, but they do not know that both Jews and Arabs hold deep-seated nationalism. Therefore, the Palestine problem is purely political in nature and unrelated to other factors. Nationalism has now spread throughout the world. The conclusion of the French-Syrian treaty has naturally excited Arab nationalism, and the flames of killing Jews in some places have also changed the Jewish view of Palestine. Previously, they considered it their concentration point, but now they see it as a refuge. The British government believes that the White Paper contains the best policy that the British government should adopt. Therefore, it wants to first seek the opinion of the Mandates Commission before engaging in contact with Jews, Arabs, and all relevant countries to establish a future administrative policy for Palestine. Mr. Law asked whether the British government would assume the protection of any minority group in the future. The Colonial Secretary replied that it was a matter for the League of Nations, and also stated that Britain had sympathy for this report, and many Arabs also supported it, such as the Transjordan government's endorsement. He sincerely hoped that Jews and Arabs would cooperate with the British government in good faith to realize the effort to bring peace to the Holy Land. (July 22nd, Reuters via Central News Agency)

[London] After the British Committee submitted a report proposing the partition of Palestine into a Jewish state, an Arab state, and a British mandated territory, the House of Commons began discussing it today. Opposition party leader Sir Archibald Sinclair spoke first, saying that he felt ashamed after reading the report. The League of Nations entrusted Britain with the mandate over Palestine, which was one of the greatest undertakings of British statesmen. Unfortunately, since 1920, British rule there has been indecisive, leading to failure, which is deeply regrettable. The British government should now seek the opinions of other countries, but it is feared that these countries will not necessarily agree with the proposals put forward by the British government. If we now abandon the task of governing Palestine, will other countries be willing to take its place? Does the House of Commons have confidence in this?” Several members of various parties spoke in succession. Among them, Conservative right-wing leader Winston Churchill proposed an amendment stating that the Committee’s report should be submitted to the League of Nations for discussion first. On the other hand, the House of Lords continued to discuss this issue today. Former Foreign Secretary Lord Reading vehemently criticized the report, stating that Palestine is one of the most delicate areas in the world. Establishing a Jewish state there is likely to lead to international disputes. The British government must not act hastily, and should organize a joint committee of the upper and lower houses to thoroughly study this matter. (July 20th, Havas News Agency)

Government newspapers have reported that the police have identified the perpetrator who injured himself in the explosion. In recent days, many people have been arrested in the capital and provinces. The Express newspaper also reported that this case involves many active-duty military officers, and a significant number of leftists have also been arrested. (July 21st, Havas News Agency)

### Japanese Residents in Shantou Return to Taiwan

Special Agents and Registered Taiwanese Engage in Activities in the Interior of Chaozhou and Shantou; Japanese Consulate in Shantou Holds Emergency Assembly Drill

Shantou Correspondence: After the Japanese army in Fengtai attacked Lugouqiao on the evening of the 8th, the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in Taiwan issued orders for the ships to mobilize that same night, dispersing to engage in activities along the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong. The speed of their actions indicates that this was planned in advance. The destroyers "Ume" and "Wakatake" entered the waters off Qilu, Shantou at 5 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, ostensibly to protect Japanese residents. Soldiers from these ships have been seen carrying heavy items back and forth between the ships and the Japanese Consulate in Shantou. Residents and members of the Japanese Association in Shantou hold meetings every night, discussing current events and reporting on the situation in the city, dispersing late at night. A secret intelligence committee has been established to assist special agents in gathering information about our military and political movements, and the sentiments of people in society regarding war and peace. Last month, a Mr. Lin led groups of special agents into the interior of Chaozhou and Shantou to carry out various activities. On the 13th, the Shantou Japanese Consulate received instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, notifying Japanese residents to prepare to leave. All women and children would first return to Keelung, Taiwan to gather. A reception center has been set up in Keelung. All Japanese residents leaving the country will receive a 50% discount on transportation. Men between the ages of 25 and 35 have received conscription notices, requiring them to settle their personal affairs and dedicate themselves to the battlefield. Those who have difficulties must submit a written application to the Consulate, requesting a postponement of conscription. Taiwanese residents with fixed occupations each have a self-defense gun hidden at home, and have been organized into intelligence, transportation, medical aid, and inspection squads, each with specific duties, maintaining absolute secrecy. Since this spring, the goods in the warehouses of the trading firms operated by Taiwanese residents in this port have been largely rotted and no one cares. Countless soybean cakes and marine products have been dumped into the sea, resulting in significant losses. The businesses of these traders have essentially failed and they have long thought of closing down, but this has been forbidden by the Japanese authorities. They are occasionally rewarded for colluding with Chinese traitors to purchase tungsten ore, scrap copper and iron, old cotton quilts, fishing nets, hemp bags, miscellaneous grains, sweet potatoes, sesame, etc. from the interior and transport them back to their country as raw materials for military supplies. For this reason, these Taiwanese residents have been able to barely survive, and the Chinese traitors, having colluded with these Taiwanese residents, are also becoming increasingly active.

On the 18th, the Japanese ships scheduled to sail between Shantou and Taiwan were detained by the Japanese military to transport soldiers. According to rumors here, the 5th, 11th, 13th, and 16th Destroyer Squadrons could arrive from Taiwan within days to protect Japanese residents, and some marines are preparing to land in the counties of Chao'an, Dongshan, and Nan'ao on the border of Fujian and Guangdong to seize these counties as bases for the navy and air force. Also, when the "Hong Kong Maru" left Shantou on the morning of the 18th, many Japanese women and children boarded the ship to Taiwan. At 9 PM that same afternoon, Japanese Consul-General Seichi Yamasaki ordered all Japanese residents to perform an emergency assembly drill at the Japanese elementary school playground. A command platform and a wireless transceiver have been built on the corner of the school building, which can communicate with Japanese ships anchored in the port using semaphore and signal lights. There is also a lookout and signaling platform on the roof of the Japanese Consulate. When a red flag is raised, it can be seen from the ships. A whistle is blown as a signal. The transportation group personnel on shore, many of whom live by the sea, hear the whistle and immediately travel by car to relay the message to the group leaders in the city's various districts. The group leaders notify the residents in each household, and each person gathers at the four designated locations in the shortest possible time, following the routes set in advance. Marines can also completely land within thirty minutes, and the transportation group guides them to the assembly points for protection. During the assembly, everyone is fully armed, awaiting orders to advance, retreat, or safely evacuate to the warships. The medical aid team of the Taiwanese residents also follows along to provide medical assistance. All designated assembly points have sandbags prepared in advance to provide cover, and temporary artillery platforms are erected to block traffic. There are currently over 500 Taiwanese residents in Chaozhou and Shantou. Judging from the steps of their emergency assembly and the thoroughness of the arrangements, the organization of other Japanese residents is even more evident. (July 20th)

### Japanese Consulate in Guangzhou Holds Meetings for Consecutive Days

Japanese Residents Preparing to Leave Guangzhou

Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of war in Hebei, Japanese warships have come to Guangdong in two teams: one patrolling the coast of Shantou and Guangzhou, and the other appearing off Hainan Island. Fearing that the fleet cannot penetrate deep inland, more than sixty Taiwanese fishing boats have been sent to Hong Kong to register with the Hong Kong government. Although nominally fishing boats, their purpose is unknown, and they have already attracted great attention from the Guangdong and Hong Kong authorities. Organizations in Hong Kong have requested the Hong Kong government to strengthen police preparations to consolidate the security of the territory. Organizations in Guangdong have also petitioned the government, requesting that the Hong Kong authorities be informed not to register these fishing boats to avoid future troubles. As for the Japanese warships arriving off the coast of Guangzhou, four of them attempted to sail into the Pearl River, but after persuasion, they turned back, yet still patrol outside Humen Port. It is said that the warships' intention to sail into the Pearl River was under the pretext of protecting Japanese residents, but the Guangdong provincial government has already explicitly ordered its subordinates to provide close protection to Japanese residents.

On the 16th and 17th, there were rumors that Japanese residents and women and children in Shamian had packed their luggage and were leaving the country. However, according to news from Shamian yesterday, not all Japanese residents in Shamian have left Guangzhou. Those who returned to their country a few days ago were only Japanese residents who were drafted into military service. Furthermore, the Japanese Consul in Shamian has ordered Japanese merchants to refrain from entering the Chinese territory unless necessary, to avoid misunderstandings. The Japanese Consulate has been shipping items to Japan and holding meetings. New Japanese have been seen entering and leaving the consulate, and the number of telegrams sent from the Japanese Consulate to Taiwan and Tokyo has increased many times. A certain secretary at the Japanese Consulate also admitted that Japanese residents in Guangzhou had indeed prepared everything so that if the negotiations on the Hebei incident broke down, they would leave Guangzhou at any time.

The coastline of Qiongya and Leizhou in the southern region is very long. Japanese warship sightings have been reported, and the authorities have made considerable preparations in Qiongya to consolidate coastal defenses. (July 20th)

### Wuxi

Dispute over Temporary Business Tax on Wheat

Regarding the case of the temporary business tax on wheat, the various flour mills in Wuxi and the wheat stores stationed in Wuxi from other ports have telegraphed to the relevant authorities, stating that the wheat raw material has already been subject to a unified tax. Since the business tax law has an exception provision, and the Ministry of Finance's original plan does not include an exemption method, the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department's order for wheat sellers to collect a temporary business tax fundamentally violates the tax law and cannot be responsible for its implementation. According to Article 25 of the Provisional Constitution, people have no obligation to pay taxes unless required by law. They request that the Jiangsu Finance Department be promptly stopped to comply with the law. At the same time, a letter was sent to the Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter to the Business Tax Bureau. Subsequently, an order was received stating that the Provincial Department had been instructed to investigate and verify. The Wuxi Business Tax Bureau yesterday received another order from the Finance Department stating that the temporary business tax on wheat is to be borne by the wheat sellers. The wheat sellers' sale of wheat is a business activity and they naturally have an obligation to pay taxes. They are instructed to implement this strictly. If the flour mills do not collect on their behalf, it is tantamount to not assisting, and their tax exemption passports should be revoked and shipments stopped. The Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded a letter to the various flour mills and wheat stores stationed in Wuxi from other ports, and they will negotiate together at the Chamber of Commerce at 9 AM on the 23rd.

Later, a Gao family resident in the area had 25 yuan of national currency stolen. The next day, the township chief reported this to the Public Security Bureau, which sent police to escort them out of the territory.

Opening Coffin to Steam Bones and Examine Corpse

Xiang A'san, a thief in the northeastern township of Tangda North, was caught stealing from Tang Ruixiang's house in the middle of the night in early January. Villagers beat him severely, causing him to die from his injuries. At that time, the relatives of the deceased, considering his past behavior, simply coffined and buried him. Later, the county police bureau learned of this and dispatched detectives to investigate. They detained a Mr. Shen, but the matter did not lead to any results due to certain reasons. Subsequently, the corpse's nephew, Xiang Xiaoxian, filed a private prosecution with the county. The county government successively ordered the arrest and interrogation of suspects Tang Wenhua, Tang A'san, Tang A'dong, Gu Tinglu, etc., but all denied participating in the assault. The case was shelved for some time. On the 20th, the corpse was transported to the temple grounds next to the moat outside the East Gate.

### Taicang

Bizarre Adultery Case

Jin Sheng, a resident of Mao Shi Township in the Sixth District of the county, works as a tanner. He married a woman named Shen, and they have been married for eight years. Jin Sheng recently discovered that Shen was having an affair with Ye Fengqing, who lived nearby, so he secretly monitored his wife's movements. On the night of the 16th, Jin Sheng was cooling off in a neighbor's yard. Fengqing, seeing an opportunity, went to Shen's place to have fun. Jin returned home and caught them, and full of anger, used his tanning knife to stab Ye. However, Ye was strong and instead knocked Jin down, seized the knife, and killed Jin. Then, with Shen, he wrapped the body in a quilt, tied it with a large stone, and threw it into the river. Yesterday morning, three small boats (commonly known as "fang yong lao ya") were releasing birds and fishing in the river. Suddenly, the birds gathered in one place. Soon, the birds were seen carrying a large package with their beaks and feet. The fishermen checked and found a corpse. The crowd gathered and identified it as Jin Sheng. Jin's grandfather and the neighborhood chief reported this to the police station in the district, who arrested the adulterous couple. On the evening of the 20th, the police were dispatched to the county to investigate. The county government is scheduled to conduct an on-site inspection this afternoon.

### 美麗盃單打複賽張定釗敗於卡遜

Yesterday, Zhang Dingzhao lost to Carson by a score of three sets to one in the semi-finals. Squia also secured a spot in the finals.

The Beautiful Cup tennis tournament, organized by the Kangdi Club, featured two singles matches and one doubles match yesterday. In the singles match, Carson competed against Zhang Dingzhao for the right to enter the finals. The match was originally scheduled for 4:00 PM, but Carson was late, so it was delayed until 5:00 PM. The strengths of both sides were relatively balanced, and the situation during the match was extremely tense. Carson's cannonball serves yesterday allowed him to gain the advantage. However, Zhang Dingzhao also demonstrated sufficient strength and, despite Carson's power, sometimes managed to subdue him. Zhang's main weakness lay in his weak backhand, which made it difficult for him to defend against Carson's serves. Otherwise, Carson would have been in danger. The final result was three sets to one, with Zhang Dingzhao sadly eliminated. Now, our Chinese players have no hope of winning the Beautiful Cup singles championship. In another semi-final match, Squia played against Fuchusi. Both players had similar skills, and the match was evenly matched. In the end, Squia defeated Fuchusi, who had purchased half of the match, with his powerful long strokes, thus earning the right to enter the finals with Carson. The finals date has been set for tomorrow. The two champions will meet, and it remains to be seen who will emerge victorious. In the doubles match, Shi Disheng and Cai Huitang were eliminated by Andrew Jinstibo Zhi Qiaofu's team with a score of two sets to one. The results of yesterday's match and today's schedule are recorded below.

▲Zhang Dingzhao loses to Carson. Zhang Dingzhao wins three consecutive points on Carson's serve, raising hopes of breaking Carson's serve. However, after a moment of hesitation, Carson wins the first game. Suffering this setback, Zhang allowed Carson to win five games in a row. Except for a slight improvement in the fifth game, Zhang only scored four points in the second, third, and fourth games, demonstrating how easily Carson won. Carson wins the first set with a score of 6-1. Starting from the second set, Zhang's strength returned, and his strokes were powerful. However, Carson's momentum remained strong. After Zhang won the first game, Carson immediately evened the score with a slippery serve in the second game. Fortunately, starting from the third game, Zhang repeatedly attacked with diagonal strokes. Carson suddenly lost control of his east side, resulting in numerous errors out of bounds. Zhang easily won the second set with a score of 6-1, making it one set each. Starting from the third set, Zhang immediately broke Carson's serve and won the second game with a slippery score, creating an extremely favorable situation. However, after Carson evened the score in the third game, Zhang lost two more slippery games, allowing Carson to take the lead with a score of 3-2. After two deuces in the sixth game, Zhang finally recovered. In the seventh game, Zhang saved a seemingly impossible ball by hitting it behind Carson, taking the lead again with a score of 4-3. After a 4-4 tie, the two sides reached 5-5 and then 6-6. In the thirteenth game, Carson seized the opportunity and won the game. After leading 7-6, Carson capitalized on his luck and won the third set with a net ball, ending the set with a score of 8-6. After a brief rest, the fourth set began. Carson continued his momentum and won three consecutive games. In the fourth game, Carson made several errors out of bounds, allowing Zhang to recover and narrow the score to 2-3. Unfortunately, this good situation did not last long. Carson then intercepted several balls at the net and lost three more games, losing the fourth set with a score of 6-2. In the end, Zhang was eliminated by Carson with a score of three sets to one.

### 一九三七年惠勃爾登網球大會（十）

— By Lieshan, Our European Correspondent

Day Eight

The eighth day of Wimbledon was again a day for women's singles. Regarding the men's singles, we dare to predict that the final two will likely be Bufan and Cranm. But when it comes to women's singles, it's much more difficult. These seven 'main players' are almost all equally strong. We can't even guess who the final four will be. The results of today's matches, except for the victory of Polish Ms. Jie Shiqiaosika, which was within our expectations, the other two matches were somewhat sudden.

Mrs. Ma Xiu defeated Ms. Li Shana, six to three, six to two.

Mrs. Ma Pu'er defeated Mrs. Shi Boling, seven to five, two to six, six to three.

Ms. Lan Chi defeated Ms. Jie Kebobu, six to four, six to two.

In fact, in terms of skill, the three who lost had a chance to win. Perhaps it was due to personal health or strategic errors. But no one can explain why they lost. Everyone felt that the losses were a bit 'sudden'.

▲ Li Shana's defeat is a pity

The most miserable defeat was naturally that of Ms. Li Shana. Not only was she the most popular for this year's World Women's Tennis Championship, but it was also more sympathetic that she was in England for eighteen months, with all expenses provided by the people of Chile (a total of five thousand pounds, a national donation to help a tennis player, perhaps this is the first time in history). So after her defeat, she felt sorry for the expectations of her compatriots. She cried for a full hour in the dressing room. We can understand her sadness. She had recently gotten engaged to a Scotsman and was preparing to get married soon. But the stimulation this time was too great. She told reporters that she had discussed it with her fiancé and postponed the wedding for a year. Next year at the Wimbledon Championships, her name will still be Li Shana, a Li Shana who is always popular with the public.

Here, we feel that Tielerden's prediction was correct. Mrs. Ma Xiu reached the final four somewhat relying on her own skills. She is already twenty-nine years old, a mother of two children. She participates in the Wimbledon Championships every year, but has never won a championship. The hope for this year is not very high either. After she meets Ms. Lant, there are still the Polish and American champions there. Ms. Lant has not appeared on the court for two or three months. Maybe she will be an “dark horse” this year. A British newspaper said that Mrs. Ma Xiu is a rare figure on the tennis court. When she won the French Women's Singles Junior Championship, she was already a married woman. This reporter's words were a bit mean.

▲ Jie Kebobu loses to Lant

Similarly, the defeat of last year's world champion, American Ms. Jie Kebobu, also made the general public feel that Ms. Lant's skills were particularly good today, and Ms. Jie was particularly bad. In the first set, Ms. Jie once led with a score of 4-2. At this time, Ms. Lant suddenly exerted herself, and her interceptions at the net were almost always successful. Later, she was even more blessed, and even her weakest forehand stroke could be used freely at this time, and the balls she hit were just over the net, and sometimes even touched the net. As a result, she won the first set with four consecutive games.

In the second set, Ms. Jie Kebobu was even more depressed. Ms. Lant took advantage of the situation and lost only two games in the middle. A champion from last year left the field in such a desperate situation. Most of the audience expressed their deep sympathy for her. Judging from Ms. Lant's performance today, the hope of winning the championship is much higher. In terms of personal skills, she is the most average of the seven. Although there are no special strengths, there are no weaknesses either. She can deal with all aspects. As long as she uses her strategy properly, she can take advantage of her opponent's weaknesses and achieve the final victory.

▲ Ma Pu'er is like Bo Qi

Mrs. Ma Pu'er's victory over Mrs. Shi Boling was the most exciting scene today. Mrs. Shi Boling is the number one player in Europe. Historically, I don't know how many female tennis players have been defeated by her. Her skills are more stable than those of Ms. Lant. However, she is also a traditional tennis player, like Jing Lan Jiao 克勞福. She lost to Ms. Jie Kebobu in the final of Wimbledon last year because the opponent adopted a new strategy. Mrs. Ma Pu'er's specialties are serving and intercepting at the net. As long as she uses this weapon effectively, she can defeat any famous player. And today is another day for her to be proud. In the first set, Mrs. Shi Boling once led with a score of 5-4. At this time, Mrs. Ma Pu'er seemed to have a determination to win or lose. Her forehand stroke and interception at the net had the style of a first-class male tennis player at Wimbledon (Mrs. Ma Pu'er's hitting posture is a bit like Bo Qi). In the blink of an eye, she reversed the situation and won the first set with a score of 7-5.

The situation in the second set was exactly the opposite. Mrs. Ma Pu'er's old problem, the forehand stroke, revealed her weakness again. Mrs. Shi Boling won this set with a score of 6-2.

After the start of the third set, Mrs. Shi Boling still used the method she used in the second set, specializing in attacking the opponent's right side, with a score of 3-0. Mrs. Shi Boling took the lead. At this moment, there was a sudden turning point. Mrs. Ma Pu'er suddenly took on a desperate attitude. The weight of her forehand stroke was terrifying. After the ball was hit, she immediately went to the net. Her rapid running did not give Mrs. Shi Boling a chance to think carefully. The ball that Mrs. Shi Boling came over could not pass the net, or it was split by her, or it became a wild ball that went out of bounds. In this way, she won six consecutive games, and on the contrary, she won the final victory with a score of 6-3. If we hadn't seen it with our own eyes, we wouldn't have imagined that a female tennis player could have such skills. Mrs. Ma Pu'er is the American champion from last month. After this battle today, she feels that her 'reputation is not reliable'. She may not win the world championship this year, but there is always hope in the next few years.

Ms. Jie Shiqiaosika won very easily. She defeated Ms. Shi Keleiweng with a score of 6-1 and 6-2. No one in the Wimbledon women's team can compare to the Polish girl's physical strength. No one can compare to the hardness of her hitting and the weight of the ball when it lands in the opponent's area. She is one of the final four today. In the next match, she will meet Mrs. Ma Pu'er. Although, we dare not predict who will win or lose, but Mrs. Ma Pu'er will not easily have the opportunity to go to the net. If Mrs. Ma Pu'er cannot use her interception skills, perhaps she will fail.

The third round of the men's singles has ended. Three pairs of 'main players', as well as Mansier and Hei Qu Te's pair, have passed safely. The fourth week of the women's doubles and mixed doubles has also begun. Wimbledon is only four days away. The closer it gets to the closing, the more tense the battle situation becomes. Everyone is waiting to see who the champion of this year will be.

### 汪主席對敎育問題之引論全文

Full Text of Chairman Wang's Introduction to Education Issues

Published in Group Discussions at the Lushan Conference

(Central News Agency) A special dispatch from Telinger: Chairman Wang made the following full text of his introduction to education issues during group discussions at the Lushan Conference on the 20th:

In recent years, due to the severity of the national crisis, the national education community has been stimulated and unanimously invigorated, and has made active efforts. With the stability of the country and the increase in funding, education at all levels has seen considerable progress in both quality and quantity. However, the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. Our work of building and saving the country should concentrate human and material resources in education and culture, and make more planned and step-by-step efforts to meet the needs of the country. In order to facilitate discussion, I will first briefly explain the current status of various education items:

㊀ Regarding compulsory education

The central government started implementing it in 1935. Currently, there are about 40 million school-age children in the country, and more than 20 million children are out of school. It was initially planned to have 80% or more of school-age children receive one-year, two-year short-term elementary school, and four-year elementary school education within five years. Since its implementation, the central government and various Geng funds have subsidized various provinces and cities with 3.2 million yuan in compulsory education funds in 1935. The compulsory education funds raised by various provinces and cities themselves totaled 11.5 million yuan. The number of students enrolled increased by 3,446,900. In 1936, the central government and various Geng funds subsidized various provinces and cities with 4.62 million yuan in compulsory education funds. The compulsory education funds raised by various provinces and cities themselves totaled about 16 million yuan. The number of students enrolled increased by about 5 million. This implementation result is not far from the original estimate. In 1937, the original plan will continue to be implemented. At the same time, the existing elementary schools will expand their enrollment and adopt a two-part system to facilitate children's enrollment. In addition, the compilation and printing of elementary school textbooks is being actively carried out.

㊁ Regarding the return of popular public education to education by the Social Affairs Bureau

In order to actively eliminate illiteracy, the Ministry of Education announced the outline for the implementation of remedial education for out-of-school people, and plans to achieve the goal of eliminating illiteracy within six years. According to the results of the promotion last year, 12 million out-of-school people have received remedial education, and 4.3 million copies of civil school textbooks have been compiled and distributed free of charge to various provinces and cities. This year's funding for this item is listed as 1.4 million yuan, and the original plan will continue to be implemented. In addition, the promotion of broadcast education and film education. As of December 1936, the Ministry of Education has distributed 1,000 radios to various provinces and cities, and more than 900 have been installed by the provinces and cities themselves. All secondary schools in the country have a public education section, which can directly receive broadcasts. The Ministry of Education has divided the country into 81 film education mobile screening areas, and some of the projectors needed for film education have been manufactured and distributed for application. This year's funding for electrical education is listed as 700,000 yuan. The promotion of broadcasting and film education will continue to be actively promoted, and the installation of various machines will be distributed free of charge or subsidized.

㊂ Regarding the training of compulsory education teachers and normal education

In order to train compulsory education teachers, the Ministry of Education has formulated measures for compulsory education teacher training classes in various provinces and cities, ordering various provinces and cities to comply with the total number of normal schools in the country. According to the survey in 1934, there were only 876 schools, and only 22,000 graduates each year were insufficient for application. Therefore, they were ordered to divide the normal school areas and expand according to the needs of local teachers, and set up simple rural normal schools and attach special normal courses and simple normal courses to normal schools and senior high schools to train elementary school teachers for the promotion of compulsory education.

㊃ Regarding secondary education

According to the survey in 1934, there are about 1,900 secondary schools in the country, and the total number of junior high school students is about 70,000. In recent years, the Ministry of Education has paid attention to the psychology and quality improvement of secondary schools, such as formulating measures for compulsory extracurricular sports for students, all students must participate in sports, and enrich the equipment of physics and chemistry instruments. In 1936, 80 sets of high school physics instruments, 180 sets of chemistry instruments, and 2,000 sets of junior high school physics instruments were manufactured and distributed to secondary schools in various provinces and cities for adoption. Start compiling some textbooks for application in various secondary schools, and seek to improve the further study of secondary school teachers. In the summer of 1935, 1936, and 1937, designated universities to hold summer training classes for secondary school teachers in conjunction with local education administrative agencies, hoping that teachers of all subjects in secondary schools will have at least one opportunity to participate in three years.

㊄ Regarding vocational education

According to statistics in 1934, there are about 350 vocational schools in the country, with a total of 46,000 students. In order to actively promote production education, the Ministry of Education ordered various provinces and cities to allocate at least 35% of the secondary school funding ratio to vocational schools by 1927. In order to enrich excellent public and private vocational schools, 430,000 yuan was allocated from the production education fund in 1936 to subsidize the equipment fees of excellent vocational schools across the country. Subsidies will continue in 1937, and it is planned to reorganize more than 30 mechanical vocational schools across the country within three years, so that more than 10,000 graduates of mechanical vocational schools will be trained in four or five years to meet the needs of construction. Vocational schools such as agriculture and midwifery are also planning to formulate annual reorganization plans. On the one hand, funds will be allocated annually from the production fund to establish national industrial vocational schools in the central locations of the country as models for vocational schools across the country.

㊅ Regarding higher education

At present, there are more than 110 schools above the junior college level in the country, with a total of more than 40,000 students. Recently, the Ministry of Education has paid attention to the reorganization of higher education, paying attention to the adjustment of departments, the full-time appointment of teachers, the rationalization of school funding, the improvement of teaching standards, and the promotion of research. Emphasis is placed on the development of medicine, agriculture, and engineering in order to cultivate excellent and sufficient talents to meet the needs of the country, and to appropriately increase the number of higher education institutions in remote or inland areas so that the distribution of regions gradually becomes more balanced. Special funds are allocated to subsidize excellent private junior colleges and universities across the country. The amount in 1936 was 730,000 yuan, and there will be a considerable increase this year. In addition, attention is paid to the addition of research institutes and the control of international students. The central government has also increased funding for higher education in recent years.

㊆ Regarding other special education facilities

In order to implement special training during the national crisis, the Ministry of Education has formulated the general outline of special education for schools at all levels and distributed it to schools for effective implementation. Special attention is paid to border education, and 500,000 yuan is allocated each year to subsidize border provinces for the promotion of education for Mongolian, Tibetan, Jia Miao, and Yi ethnic groups. An additional 230,000 yuan is allocated annually for youth education in the four northeastern provinces, specifically for the relief of out-of-school youth in the four northeastern provinces. Furthermore, in conjunction with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Education has drafted measures to reorganize overseas Chinese education and actively improve it. The above is an overview of the current education in our country. I hope that you will give it a thorough review and give accurate instructions on all the efforts and improvements that should be made in future education, so as to help with the facilities and provide a reference.

Established for three years, it has assisted more than a thousand out-of-school women. The school has a beautiful environment, excellent facilities, and a grand scale, with low tuition fees.

Great China Affiliated High School

Starting next semester, the high school of Great China Middle School on Zhongshan Road in this city will implement militarization, and the junior high school will implement military-style activities, hoping to integrate teaching and life.

### Municipal Museum Plans to Establish an Aquarium

The Municipal Museum was instructed by the municipal government in June, considering that there are no fewer than tens of millions of fishermen along the coast and rivers of our country who depend on fishing for a living. However, the production methods are backward, and fishing encroachment is severe. Shanghai is also an important fishing port. In order to enhance public understanding of the fishing industry, improve production, and resist fishing encroachment, it is planned to establish an aquarium. Furthermore, since the aquarium is an affiliated undertaking of the museum, the museum is responsible for the preparatory work and has designated 14,000 square meters of land south of Qiujiang, north of Zhengtong Road, and west of Funan Left Road in the two administrative districts of the city center for the construction of the municipal aquarium.

### Jiangsu Education Department Eliminates Educational Procurement Malpractices

Methods are established, and sub-bureaus are instructed to comply.

The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, considering that the educational authorities in various counties have deeply ingrained malpractices in the use of construction and procurement funds, resulting in substantial annual expenditures while school buildings remain in disrepair and equipment remains lacking. This is all due to the lax supervision by county bureaus, and the failure of supervisors and responsible education committee members to overcome personal relationships, or even collusion and fraud, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, it has specially drafted temporary measures for the construction and procurement of county education bureaus, sections, and county-level educational institutions in Jiangsu Province, with the aim of eliminating accumulated malpractices. A copy of the original measures has been issued to all counties for compliance.

### Securities

Shorts Seem to be Covering: Unified Bonds Soar Two or Three Yuan

Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange gradually turned to a peak, and the situation slightly reversed. Shorts became panicked and began to cover positions, causing market prices to skyrocket. The bond market, which had been heavily suppressed for two weeks, finally began to show its face. Throughout yesterday, the market opened with a calm atmosphere, and demand from various camps surged, leading to a strong upward trend. Prices for various bonds rose by more than two to three and a half yuan. Bonds No. 3, 14, 18, 45, 50, and 24 were bought, while only No. 6 and 10 were sold to a small extent. In the secondary market, there was temporarily more selling, but only Category E bonds rose by a quarter of a yuan, while the rest slightly retreated by two, three, or seven to eight cents. The total turnover amounted to 29,085,000 yuan. The resulting comparison of rises and falls is listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).

Lucrative Public Bond Arbitrage

Under the current phenomenon of a bond market where near-term prices are weak and long-term prices are firm (comparing the situation over two months), previous large-scale purchases can now be confirmed as speculative. This is because July-term public bonds can yield three yuan in interest. Looking at yesterday's closing prices (setting aside the initial market), the current month is only four cents more expensive than the August term, resulting in a profit of two yuan and six cents. If this is an investment arbitrage of two yuan and six cents, discounting by 30%, then the public bond interest rate reaches more than 3.5%. Despite such a high interest rate, the financial community is still watching from the sidelines, demonstrating that speculative waves hinder investment books. Where is the initial intention of advocating actively promoting interest rate policies and reforming the unified public bond now? I respectfully record the two-month difference in the secondary market yesterday morning for reference.

This phenomenon has been occurring for several days. Regardless of the need to deduct commissions and the difference in buying and selling prices, the generosity of the interest is undeniable and truly unparalleled.

New York Stock Market Declines Slightly

Yesterday (21st), the New York stock market was erratic, and trading was sparse. The total turnover for the day was 980,000 shares. According to brokers, prices are likely to continue to fluctuate, but there does not appear to be a crisis of a severe decline. Therefore, it is advisable to retain purchased stocks. Those with sufficient cash can take advantage of the dips to add to their positions.

### Finance

Benchmark Gold and Fine Gold Both Retreat Yesterday

The gold market retreated yesterday along with fine gold. With public bonds rebounding and people's confidence restored, the morning began with the London spot gold price unchanged. The central bank's posted prices revealed that both British and American gold prices were flat, and customs gold was unchanged. The benchmark gold bond remained at 1135.7 yuan, opening in the morning at 1144.5 yuan. Dadecheng, Wuchangxiang, Yifeng, Yongyuanmao, and Yongtuoshou sold off, retreating to three and a half yuan. Shengyuan, Yongyuanmao, and Yongnatiao raised to three yuan and eight cents. Yifeng, Yongyu, and Xixiang were still selling. The afternoon close retreated to 1142.5 yuan, a drop of three yuan compared to the previous close and a level still seventeen yuan higher than the settlement price. The addition of water to fine gold turned lower, at about 50 yuan, with a price of 1200 yuan. Jingfu sold 140 taels, Dafengheng 70 taels, and Tongfengheng 50 taels, all of which were absorbed by silver shops. There are still 189 bars of this month's strips remaining, 630 bars for August, and 854 bars for September. Among these, there are 14 long positions and 9 short positions. One hundred and sixty-one bars were traded in half-extinguished transactions.

### Speculation on the Soaring Price of Fine Gold

The soaring price of fine gold the other day and the horizontal jump in jewelry gold were said to be influenced by the Yangtze River and the inland areas, a similar reflection to the drop in public bonds. Shanghai tycoons can sell off and buy foreign exchange, while people in the inland, hearing the news of the drop in public bonds, are anxious and helpless, with the only option being to scramble to buy gold. This was the direct cause of the rise in fine gold the other day, while small banks indirectly felt the tremors.

The addition of water to fine gold has always been based on sample gold. If the benchmark gold price is 1140 yuan, then fine gold should be about 15 yuan higher, because benchmark gold has a fineness of 978, while fine gold has a fineness above 99. There is a difference of thirteen points in fineness between the two. However, since benchmark gold switched to opening gold for debt settlement on September 8, 1924, the market has been sluggish, and the source has also become silent. Furthermore, due to the low-interest-rate policy, arbitragers have also been releasing spot goods one after another, which the central bank has always been absorbing, resulting in a surprisingly dry base. Benchmark gold is also restricted by the settlement price, unable to receive goods upon maturity. Although London gold prices have not been expensive, ordinary merchants have no ability to directly order, and the situation still requires water fees and all kinds of miscellaneous expenses. Various spot gold houses have no choice but to act within their means and cautiously sell, and as a result, the demand for pure gold exceeds the supply, and market prices have soared.

### Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand is Complex

The Outcome is Close to Flat and Relatively Firm

The foreign exchange market initially showed that overseas telegrams indicated that London had narrowed by 125 for nearby months and 0625 for distant months. The New York silver market remained flat, with the British pound rising 7 mills against the US dollar, 69 centimes against the French franc, and unchanged against the Japanese yen. The US dollar narrowed by 0625 against the British pound, fell 2.875 against the French franc, and remained unchanged against the Japanese yen. The morning opening prices for nearby months were the same as the previous close, but distant British pounds and US dollars each loosened by 03125. Later, foreign firms and Chinese merchants vigorously bought US dollars, while banks aggressively sold them. HSBC posted prices that were flat for both British pounds and US dollars, gradually loosening. The forward market was even more so. However, banks took advantage of the cheap prices to buy forward sterling, while customers bought East Asian currencies. Midway through the session, more US dollars were offered from abroad. Foreign firms continued to buy British pounds and Japanese yen, while Chengjin bought US dollars and the Bank of China sold them. The situation was still loose. At the close, nearby prices were the same as the previous close for both British pounds and US dollars, and both were firm for distant months. The Japanese yen was also the same. Chinese merchants and foreign firms were buying from abroad, while banks were selling. Northern merchants sold US dollars and bought Japanese yen, with brisk trading.

British currency: Mecca and Great British sold 125 for October, China Italy sold 1875 for August. Later, profit Great British sold 15625 for September to the foreign bank, with a turnover of about 80,000 to 90,000 pounds.

American currency: Mecca Lee Hua Yi sold 2875 and 25 for September to the foreign bank, HSBC Mecca Lee sold 15625 and 1875 for October, Mecca Lee Shanghai sold 25 for September, profit Lee sold 09125, 125 and 1875 for November, Dalian helped sell to Citibank Mitsui for October, five foreign countries sold spot goods of 59375 to Citibank Huabi, and profit sold 125 for November. Later, Citibank entered 4375 for August from abroad, Mecca Lee sold 1875 for October to Xin Feng, and the Bank of China sold 4375 for August to Zhengjin, with a turnover of about one million yuan.

East Asian currency: Zhengjin and Sanmai sold 101.75 for July to Tianjin and Dalian gangs. Later, North Korea Zhengjin sold 101.75 for July to the foreign bank, with a turnover of about 600,000 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton

Public Bonds Rebound, Cotton Yarn Quickly Rises: However, Osaka Spot Yarn and Thread Plunge

The yarn market is trending upward again, with floating shorts covering positions and longs active. At the same time, public bonds are rebounding, boosting people's confidence. In addition, in recent times, demand from all sides has been smooth, and inventory in warehouses has been gradually decreasing, so the market is solid. However, cloth trading is sluggish, the condition of American cotton is deteriorating daily, and Osaka spot yarn and thread have plummeted. The price of 20-count spot yarn is already at a high level.

October Up Five Yuan, Two Corners

At the opening of the marked yarn market, prices for all months turned upward, and sentiment was good. Floating shorts covered positions, and prices rose by 1.9 to 3.2 yuan. However, overseas cotton industry conditions are still trending downward. Nevertheless, spot yarn trading is still considered robust, and cloth factories in the interior have not stopped stocking up. After the market stabilized, the prices for November and December were requested by the directors and chairmen of the brokers' association to the supervisors, and it was allowed to start trading temporarily before the completion of the registration certificate procedures for yarn factories and yarn and cotton merchants. The results of the marked yarn market show that prices for all months rose by 2.5 to 5.2 yuan compared to the closing prices of the previous day. The sales volume was 300 bales for Yuanda, 500 bales for Hexing, 500 bales for Fengtai, 600 bales for Shenji, 450 bales for Qianchang, 350 bales for Dachang, 400 bales for Fukang, and 300 bales for Yongda. The purchases were 500 bales for Dafu, 200 bales for Guji, 350 bales for Tongfeng, 350 bales for Renfeng, 1150 bales for Yuan Yi, 950 bales for Runkang, and 350 bales for Shengyuan. The half-day market prices are listed on the left.

Japanese Yarn Rises Back by Three to Four Yuan

Spot yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, the total purchase volume by various groups throughout the day was 1516 bales. Selling prices are average. Japanese yarn rose by 3.4 yuan. The purchase volume of each group is as follows.

The Condition of American Cotton is Deteriorating Daily; Local Cotton Rebounded Yesterday: An Expected Phenomenon After Days of Sharp Declines

After days of sharp declines in the cotton market, there was a dramatic rebound yesterday. This situation was also expected. Because spot cotton prices are low and the sales of delivered cotton yarn are brisk, factories may have a chance to develop. And futures cotton is also relatively cheap.

Chenhua Surges by Two Yuan, Two Corners

At the opening of the marked cotton market, prices rose rapidly as the yarn market rose and the recent downward trend suddenly reversed, aided by a piece of good news. Prices for all months surged by 5 cents to 1.2 yuan. After the second session, it remained quiet. By the close, there was more floating short covering, and August jumped again by 7 cents. The result of marked cotton was that Chenhua rose by 1.2 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the new rose by 1 to 1.6 yuan. The sales volume was 1800 dan for Tongxing, 900 dan for Hexing, 1200 dan for Ruid, 600 dan for Zhongda, 900 dan for Shenji, 700 dan for Taichang, 1400 dan for Yichang, and 600 dan for Laikang. The purchases were 2200 dan for Dafu, 1500 dan for Fenji, 1600 dan for Shenda, 1400 dan for Changyu, 1000 dan for Yi Da, 3900 dan for Yicheng, 1000 dan for Shengyuan, 2100 dan for Xincheng, and 1700 dan for Yikang. The highest and lowest prices for half a day are listed on the left.

Indian Cotton Consumption Remains Stagnant

Futures cotton has been falling sharply for a long time and is gradually showing signs of rebounding and stabilizing. The demand for spot cotton by factories remains sluggish. However, the sales of cotton yarn continue. The environment has improved slightly, and factories may have a chance to develop. 200 bales arrived at the dock. It is also reported that the market situation in Tianjin, Hankou, and other places is erratic due to the impact of the current situation.

Marked Yarn Restores Six-Month Term Trading

Regarding the restoration of six-month term trading in the marked yarn market, the Ministry's order approved the opening of trading. The November and December terms were added as usual the other day. Subsequently, due to cumbersome registration procedures, they could not be issued in time and could not be traded as usual. The directors and chairmen of the brokers' association went to the supervisors to convey the difficulties and asked the supervisors to observe the business difficulties and temporarily allow all legitimate yarn factory and yarn and cotton merchants to accept buying and selling commissions as usual before the registration and certificate procedures are completed in order to maintain business and prevent stagnation.

World Cotton Markets Plummet

Yesterday, American cotton opened, and the news from Liverpool was not good. Longs closed positions, and foreign merchants, New Orleans, and local gangs sold off. The weather was favorable, and pest damage was not severe. Prices for all months fell by 6 points to 1 pound sterling. Spot demand and cloth sales were poor, and new purchases were lacking. Although there was opportunistic buying and short covering, it could not withstand the general sentiment of selling. The close was calm. Spot goods fell by 19 pounds sterling, futures fell by 16 to 19 pounds sterling, British cotton spot goods fell by 9 points, and futures fell by 19 to 21 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to the sale of futures traders and shorts, but then rebounded slightly due to purchases by the same industry, short covering, cotton merchants buying Indian cotton, and selling American cotton. In the end, it was exhausted due to bad news from Liverpool. The prices of Pingguo rose by 1.5 to 2 rupees, Aomura fell by 2.75 to 3 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 2.5 to 2.71 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 21st).

▲ Osaka, 22nd Osaka telegram, spot yarn fell by 4 to 8 yuan, 16-count fan surface 235 yuan, fell by 5 yuan, 20-count goldfish 255 yuan, fell by 4 yuan, 40-count five stars 350 yuan, fell by 7 yuan, 42-count pheasant 365 yuan, fell by 8 yuan.

### Piece Goods

East White Fine Cloth Sales are Particularly Strong

▲ Printed Colored Fabrics are Sold at Reduced Prices: Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a consistent rebound in marked yarn and cotton. The buying interest in East Piece Goods and General Merchandise was slightly stronger. Local dyeing factories and wholesalers took advantage of the low prices to purchase more than 1,000 pieces, with fine cloth being the main commodity. It is said that the colored cloth belt along the Yangtze River is stirring, so they rushed to cover their positions. The market price of dyed blank fine cloth rebounded by 5 cents to 1 dime per piece. However, fine twill and color twill are weakly priced due to flat customer demand. The market is still weak. Japanese merchant companies and foreign firms are selling various types of spot printed blank cloth at reduced prices due to the decline in demand from printing factories. Offered prices can be negotiated, but transactions are very rare. The prices of Donghuo direct tribute pique and tribute satin, which are cleaned, dyed, and finished, have been falling continuously. They fell again yesterday (per yard) by 1.5 cents. The white cloth goods from this factory are still firm. Orders from Sichuan, Guangdong, and the Yangtze River are still strong. The supply of spot goods is limited. However, cleaned goods pique yarn twill currently have active sales, and sales are average. Bleached cloth and blue cloth, which were originally maintained and did not fall, are now continuing to rebound by 2-3 cents. Deep and light colored printed cloth is extremely sluggish.

▲ Yuanfang Auction House Has Not Yet Opened: Yesterday was Thursday, the scheduled auction day for Yuanfang Foreign Firm of this city. Due to the instability of the situation in the north, foreign goods piece goods industry counterparts held a meeting at the firm at 9:00 AM. After discussions between the firms, it was decided to temporarily suspend the auction for another period to observe the situation. It is tentatively scheduled to open next Thursday.

### Grains

Saigon Rice is Fixed to Open at 4,000 Tons: The Price is Seven Yuan, Five Jiao, Four Fen: Kexian Rice Sales in the North and South are Not Weak

Yesterday, Kexian rice digestion remained strong. Oil heads and greedy buyers remained active. Inland local streets were also not weak. Northwest Yang and Weihai gangs also made some small purchases every day. Yesterday's transactions exceeded 16,000 bags. High-grade rice continued to rise by 4-5 cents. Given the lively state of the north, south, and local Kexian rice, the market may need to be expanded further. However, Saigon No. 1 rice is newly fixed to open at 4,000 tons, sold by a certain foreign firm, etc., at a price of 7 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 fen. However, with the addition of taxes, each stone must cost about 13 yuan, which is not something that merchants can afford to divide. However, Kexian rice may be slightly flattened because of this. Yesterday, 5,819 bags of Jiangxi rice, 5,578 bags of Hubei rice, and 5,000 bags of Hancao rice were released.

Flour and Wheat Have Mostly Automatically Closed Out: Flour Factories Have Also Reduced Production

The prices of flour and wheat on the market remain unchanged. Due to the current situation, the prices of all months are automatically closing out. Although the distance between the standard and spot goods is still far, at this point, it seems that there is no longer any interest in the market. The situation of spot goods is also stagnant, with no obvious transactions. The export of flour is restricted, and factories have reduced production. Wheat is naturally unwilling to be cheaply sold because of the high price of flour in other cities. This kind of stalemate may not be broken for a while, and it also has an impact on the social economy.

The Rising Trend of He Xia Rice Has Stopped

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were more than 30 numbers, with a total of 67-800 stones. The rising trend of the previous dynasty still had aftershocks yesterday. At the beginning of the morning, the hands, urban and rural stores, and stomachs were still quite active. The selling side shouted higher and higher, and the prices of thick and early japonica rice all increased by 2-3 jiao. The price of thin rice also increased by about 1 jiao. However, the market suddenly turned sluggish at noon, and the market color returned to softening. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice both fell by a few fen to about 1 jiao. According to this situation, it seems difficult for the market to develop in the future, or to move towards a softer position. Duyang sharp high grade A, yuan reached a good price, etc.

(Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of Shanghai from various places were few, only 11-12 numbers. At the opening of the market in the morning, because the rising trend of the previous market was not strong, the customers also wanted to shout for a tightening of about 1 jiao, the intentions of the noodle shops became weaker, and the situation turned peaceful again, causing the trading of various goods to be sluggish. What was traded was also limited, and the market shape was fixed and laborious. The price of early and thin rice, which was in short supply, was not opened. The prices of various grains and other remaining goods were peaceful.

Yellow Beans are Driven by the Sales of Bean Cakes

Yesterday's yellow bean market, regardless of new or old goods, saw a good situation. Because of the lack of high-quality new beans, the sales of various gangs were tireless, so the atmosphere turned upward by 7-8 fen. The transactions were 4-500 bags of Chengmentou beans, 210 bags of Zhengyang beans, 300 bags of Jiangqiao beans, and 61 bags of Zhuxi beans. Old beans were still active due to the lively sales of bean cakes, with a total of more than 20,000 pieces of various brands of factory cakes made for both spot and futures. The market price rose by 2 fen, so people had to tighten, temporarily unaffected by the falling trend in the Lianshi market. However, the oil pressing factories were watching the stomach reflex, because the selling price was shouted high. Yesterday, the Guanggang, etc. on this street only handled 450 bags of Tancheng beans, 3 cars of Zhengyangguan beans, and 40 bags of Hankou Zhazha beans.

### Silk and Tea

There is no Shortage of Silk Reelers to Exit White Silk Factories

The silk market was weak in the morning and firm at noon. The silk sales of users and gangs were active yesterday. Shanghai white silk factories and Shandong factories all made transactions. The sale volume was generally the same. Because the inventory in this port was sparse and the arrivals were not many, the price of Sichuan and Lu silks was relatively firm. The sale volume of Shanghai white silk factories varied greatly. During the morning trading, the reelers exited, and the price of Tiantai grade Silk was 780 yuan. Some said that the lowest new price for this and that silk was 760 yuan. In the afternoon, because the price of Yokohama silk rebounded, the sentiment in this port also tended to be good. Ordinary white silk factories hovered above 800 yuan, while Yangfan silk was around 815 yuan. A total of 80 dan were traded. In the foreign firm silk market, British and French silk remained unmoved, and American silk remained silent. There was a slight purchase of non-sale silk, with a total of 37 dan for GuBao Mian, etc.

The Sales of Red and Green Tea Have Revived

Yesterday's red and green tea market rebounded. The inventory of Keemun and Ningxia black tea was only more than 20,000 boxes. British Zhuang and various foreign firms heard that Anhui Local Bank and Jiangxi Provincial Yumin Bank had prepared funds to buy all of them. The intention to enter suddenly turned strong. Chia Wo, Jinlong Baochang and other firms all selected and purchased a lot. The sentiment was quite excited. The trading of Zhuang green tea was still not lonely. Among the various goods, Xizhen Meishui and Mei Xiu Mei had the most smooth sales. Although the current inventory is not very abundant, the selling price has not risen. Zhongguan Zhenmei, Low Zhuang Zhenmei, and He He Fushi Baolong had slightly purchased, and the price had become softer than before by 2 jiao. At the Ping Shui tea market yesterday, Jinlong handled the Da Bang of National Goods at a price of 41 yuan. Also, Chia Wo and Cha Ban handled several colors of the Yipinxiang Da Bang, and the price was still stable. Xiehe handled more than 100 boxes of Tuzhuang Dingwenchang, at a price of about 50 yuan. In addition, the trading of eyebrow tea was still quite lively.

### North and South Goods

Pickled Mustard Tubers Rebounded by a Small Yuan

Pickled mustard tubers have been arriving in abundance recently. Due to the recent situation, the merchants have no intention of storing them in warehouses and want to sell them off quickly, causing the market to rebound by a small yuan. The market price of the genuine Luoxi Cai brand has been reduced to 30 yuan, and the price of Ling Cai has been reduced to 25 yuan. The customer sales stock is booming, and the business is currently in season, so the market is still stable. The market price is 26 yuan for the market sales, 29 yuan for Yu Tong, 24 yuan and 5 jiao for Hongli Yue, 22 yuan for Zengling Cai Gao, and 20 yuan for the lower grade.

▲Assembly Declaration

What time is it now? It is the time that concerns the continuation or interruption of China's five-thousand-year history and the survival or extinction of the 400 million people of the Chinese nation. To resist the enemy is to live; to fail to resist the enemy is to die. To fight to the death is to live; to greedily cling to life is to die. All those with blood and breath share this sentiment. Since the September 18th Incident to now, six years have passed. The Chinese nation's love for peace and its efforts to endure humiliation have been demonstrated to the world. However, the more we retreat, the more the enemy advances. Their intention is to never stop until they have exterminated the entire Chinese nation. Even with the Lugouqiao Incident, repeated provocations are not enough. They even use the name of compromise to conduct troop deployments in secret, intending to use military force to achieve their ambition of gradual encroachment. This is a blood debt that cannot be tolerated. Now the central government has announced a policy of self-defense, and the soldiers all have the determination to die. All Chinese people should rise up, unify their organizations, concentrate their strength, seek survival with iron and blood, and provide assistance in resisting the enemy. With one heart and one mind, we should always keep this in mind, each exerting their abilities and each doing their best. We vow not to slacken until we achieve the goal of territorial integrity and national rejuvenation. Alas, if our country does not want to survive, then so be it; if our nation does not want to live, then so be it. If we want to survive, then for the next ten years, there will be no day without war. Whether fighting or negotiating, we are still at war. Compatriots, from today onwards, strengthen your resolve and sharpen your weapons. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, act swiftly, ensure sufficient food and soldiers, and do not rely on temporary enthusiasm. Engage in a permanent war of resistance, never forgetting this shame and never slackening in your determination. Fathers advise, brothers encourage, forever remember and never forget. This declaration is hereby made for your public assessment.

▲Committee Meeting

Finally, slogans were shouted: ㊀ Unite to resist the enemy, ㊁ Eliminate traitors, ㊂ Support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ㊃ Long live the Republic of China. It was also learned that the association is scheduled to hold its first committee meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM on the 24th (Saturday). At that time, in addition to electing the secretary-general and other important officers and handling matters entrusted by the general assembly, a special committee will be established to actively promote the association's affairs.

### Flour Shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin and Tanggu Was Seized by the Japanese Army

Over 300,000 Bags of Flour Seized in Warehouses in Tianjin and Tanggu, Valued at Over 1 Million Yuan

Since the outbreak of war in North China, Shanghai's shipping industry has suffered a major blow. Recently, merchants from Tianjin also suffered a particularly huge loss, namely, a large quantity of flour was seized by the Japanese army for military use. Emergency meetings have been held for days without any remedy. The details are described as follows:

Both Wharves Occupied

When the Japanese army advanced into Shanhaiguan and arrived in Fengtai and Tianjin, they first occupied the Tanggu wharf and cargo ships of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for military use. The wharf is very large and can simultaneously berth three oceangoing vessels of 4,000 to 5,000 tons. Its warehouse capacity is the largest of all companies in Tanggu. After the wharf and warehouse were occupied, the Tianjin line of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's liners was immediately suspended. Yesterday, the company continued to receive telegrams from Tianjin reporting that the company's wharf and warehouse in Zizhu Forest in Tianjin had also been forcibly occupied by the Japanese army. Japanese troops were stationed in each warehouse. Zizhu Forest is located in the British Concession. How could the Japanese army forcibly occupy it? It turns out that the Osaka Company's wharf is adjacent to it. The Japanese army then invaded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's warehouse from the Osaka wharf. Therefore, as of yesterday, the wharves and warehouses in Tianjin and Tanggu had been occupied.

Flour Seized as Military Rations

The total amount of flour recently shipped from Shanghai and stored in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's warehouse in Tanggu was more than 300,000 bags. The current market price is more than four yuan per bag, totaling 1.26 million yuan in national currency. The Tianjin Zizhu Forest wharf and warehouse also contained grains and flour worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. After the Japanese army occupied the two warehouses, they seized all the huge amount of flour stored in the warehouses, worth more than 1 million yuan, to be used as rations for the Japanese army entering Shanhaiguan. This time, the company's "Gongping" ship was loaded with the latest batch of flour to Tanggu and had just been unloaded into the warehouse when it was seized. The "Gongping" ship only telegraphed to Shanghai yesterday morning, saying that it had left Tanggu. It was also fortunate that the ship was not detained.

Shanghai Merchants Hold Emergency Meeting

The bad news of the seizure of this huge amount of flour reached Shanghai, and the merchants in Shanghai who handled this flour were shocked. The batch of flour was recently purchased by merchants in Shanghai on behalf of merchants in Tianjin. It had just been shipped to Tianjin and Tanggu when the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and it was seized in full for use as military rations. It involved the merchants' capital of as much as 1.26 million yuan. Because the matter was too serious, the merchants immediately convened an emergency meeting of those concerned yesterday to discuss ways to salvage the situation. As a result, apart from telegraphed appeals to the authorities of Hebei and Chahar for negotiations, there were no other solutions.

### Kawagoe's Southward Trip Temporarily Difficult to Realize

The Kwantung Army Firmly Retains Him, and He Cannot Leave

According to a report from the Takung News Agency, according to relevant sources, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe Shigeru, originally planned to travel south to Nanjing on the 15th of this month to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui to discuss a solution to the Lugouqiao Incident. However, due to the firm retention of the Kwantung Army and the Tianjin Garrison Army, Kawagoe could not leave and announced its cancellation. It is now learned that the atmosphere in Tianjin and Beiping is still extremely tense. At the same time, a large number of Japanese troops are gathering, seemingly with major plans. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how the situation will evolve. As a result, Kawagoe seems unlikely to travel south for the time being. Moreover, Tajiri, the intelligence chief of the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai, recently went to Nanjing from Shanghai, also in response to Kawagoe's telegram, to receive a report on the general situation in Nanjing and Shanghai and to receive instructions on the future direction of diplomatic affairs. Based on this, Kawagoe is not preparing to travel south in the short term.

### China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping Flights Continue as Scheduled

Yesterday's Northbound Plane Arrived in Beiping

After the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the situation in North China became tense. In order to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Beiping, the Shanghai-Beiping flights of the China National Aviation Corporation continued as scheduled yesterday. The plane took off from Longhua Airport in Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday, carrying three passengers to Beiping. It arrived at Nanyuan Airport in Beiping at 2:45 PM that afternoon and will fly south from Beiping today.

### Yesterday, More Students Returning from Japan

Totaling More Than 40 People

Since the Lugouqiao Incident became serious, Chinese students in Japan have returned to China in batches on their own initiative. Yesterday, when the Shanghai Maru arrived in Shanghai, more than 40 people returned to the country.

### Records of Contemporary Figures' Movements

Niu Yongjian took the 7:50 AM express train out of Nanjing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 1:45 PM on the same day.

### The City Federation Issues a Notice to Pay Attention to Traitorous Activities

Preventing Disruption of the Rear

The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District issued a notice to the district branches yesterday to pay close attention to traitorous activities. The original letter read: "Dear Sirs, at the third standing committee meeting of the association held on the 11th of this month, Committee Member Gu Yucang proposed that, as the war has broken out in North China and the situation is serious, the association should issue a notice to the district branches to pay close attention to traitorous activities. This proposal has been approved. The corresponding proposal is hereby sent to you. It is important to pay close attention to prevent traitors from disrupting the rear."

### Preparatory Work in Various Circles in This City During the Extraordinary Period

After the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the enemy was insatiably greedy, and the people of the whole country were unanimously indignant. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech and announced the national policy, the people also understood the impact and began to make various preparations for the extraordinary period. For example, medical rescue and the statistics of food have been carried out separately. The details are recorded as follows:

Medical Rescue

In this North China incident, medical rescue is of paramount importance. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the National Health Administration, came to Shanghai today (22nd) to discuss the rescue work of the Red Cross Society with leaders from all walks of life. The reporter specifically interviewed Director Liu. Director Liu said that the administration and the Red Cross Society are actively preparing for medical rescue work for soldiers and civilians in the front. The organization of a severe injury surgery team in Beiping has long been completed. However, in the past few wars, although many compatriots in various places generously donated money to express their condolences, the items sent were not needed in the front, or they wanted to donate money without knowing where to send it, or they did not specify the purpose. As a result, the donors' expected goals were not achieved. Now the Red Cross Society is intensifying its work, purchasing materials, and recruiting personnel, all of which require funds. At present, we urgently hope that compatriots from all walks of life at home and abroad will automatically donate and actively contribute. All medical rescue supplies and medicines are welcome. Because what the soldiers and civilians in the front lack and urgently need is medical relief work, especially donations, so that they can purchase what is needed according to their discretion, which is more appropriate. All donations of funds and equipment can be directly delivered to the Shanghai China Red Cross Society or notified to the Health Administration for transfer. so that the Red Cross's front-line relief work can be carried out quickly.

In order to plan for the rescue of innocent soldiers and civilians as soon as possible, the medical institutions in this city have been actively preparing for the important work of the extraordinary period in accordance with the instructions of the Rescue Committee. According to sources, medical personnel have always been unwilling to lag behind in their loyalty to defend the country and resist the enemy. Now that all circles in Shanghai are preparing for this anti-enemy operation, the medical community should also catch up. The epidemic hospitals, the China Red Cross Hospital, the Chinese Medical Association, the Physicians' Association, the Anti-Epidemic Association, and various physicians' medical colleges in this city have all begun preparations. All rescue equipment and medicines have also been purchased. It is reported that as soon as the great war in North China begins, they will jointly mobilize and go north to carry out rescue work.

The United Federation of Charitable Organizations held a design group meeting at the Renji Hall at 5:00 PM yesterday. The design group leaders Zhao Jinqing, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, Yin Guanzhi, and Xie Jiaqian were publicly elected. Zhao Jinqing, chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting. It was then decided through discussion to establish a "Special Design Committee" under the Federation of Charitable Organizations to be responsible for overall planning and methods for rescuing refugees in the war zone. The organization charter was passed on the spot, and responsible personnel were appointed.

Statistics on Grain

In order to cope with the extraordinary period, prevent grain from assisting the enemy, and implement merchants' automatic control, the Coarse Grain, Bean, and Rice Industry Association of this city has specially organized a Grain Arrival and Sales Committee. Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and other 13 people were appointed as members. In order to carry out the work actively, the association held its first committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday on the third floor of the Coarse Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association on Minguo Road. Zheng Baozhao, Gu Xinyi, Yang Heqing, Chen Ziyi, and Cai Yukun, totaling 15 people, were present. Gu Xinyi was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, who first reported the purpose of the meeting and then discussed: ㊀ How to handle the investigation of the number of stocks? Resolved: Send personnel to each warehouse daily to investigate the actual stock quantity. ㊁ Investigation of the number of arrivals and sales?

It was resolved to submit it to the Municipal Government for approval and forward it to the Jianghai Customs for implementation. A notice was also issued saying: "Dear Sirs, the association, etc., convened an emergency meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members on the 20th of this month to discuss ways to prevent grain from assisting the enemy. It was resolved that all transactions of rice and grain from Dalian, Andong, Yingkou, Qinhuangdao, and Sipu should be rejected. Those who purchase rice from other ports in Shanghai must have a certificate from the local chamber of commerce before the transaction can be carried out. Industry members are notified to comply. The record of the meeting is hereby recorded and notified. It is hoped that everyone will follow these instructions."

National Products

The China National Products Manufacturers' Association of this city held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the Shuijili Association at 2:00 PM yesterday. The chairman was Liu Zhongying. Matters resolved: ㊀ At this extraordinary period, each member of the factory should make preparations for the extraordinary period and strictly control the output to maintain the needs of the country.

### The Silk Fabric Industry Association Cables, Requesting the Cancellation of the Ban on Dry Cocoons Leaving the Province

The Raw Materials Maintenance Committee Will Meet Today to Discuss Petitioning the Executive Yuan

After the Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces' cocoon and silk control agencies banned the export of dried cocoons, Shanghai silk factories and industries established a Raw Materials Maintenance Committee. Yesterday, they cabled Jiangsu Province, requesting the revocation of the ban, and have scheduled a meeting today to discuss petitioning strategies. The detailed situation is recorded below:

Jiangxi and Zhejiang Announce a Ban on Export

After the silk control agencies of Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces banned the export of dried cocoons, the announcement of the Zhejiang Silk Control Committee is recorded as follows: "It has been found that silk factories within the province are already lacking in raw materials due to the spring cocoon collection this year. There have been reports of dried cocoons from within the province being continuously transported out, causing further panic among the province's silk factories regarding the raw materials they require. A strict ban should be implemented to maintain the livelihoods of employees and the operations of manufacturers. This matter has been submitted to the provincial government for approval and is being handled accordingly. In addition to instructing the silk improvement zones of all counties and cities to supervise and ensure the prohibition of all affiliated departments, this announcement is hereby issued to all silk factories and cocoon merchants within the province. They are required to comply. Before a clear order of lifting the ban is issued after this announcement, they must not transport dried cocoons out of the province. Those who dare to disobey will be severely punished without leniency. This announcement is also being published simultaneously with the rules for cocoon merchants to collect cocoons. Article 6 stipulates that the registration date for cocoon merchants to collect cocoons will be the first three days of each period. Priority registration will be given to silk factories within the province. The amount of cocoon collection registered for both the spring and autumn periods will be calculated according to the number of machines each factory has, limited to half of the factory's annual raw material needs. If the amount collected is insufficient, it will be supplemented during the summer period to supplement the spring period, and the late autumn period to supplement the autumn period. After the silk factories in the province have completed registration, ordinary registration will be processed if there is a surplus. The start and end dates of each registration period will be publicly announced by the committee in the newspapers."

Cables Requesting the Revocation of the Dry Cocoon Ban

The Shanghai Silk Factory and Industry Association cabled Jiangsu Province yesterday, stating: "Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement and Management Committee, it is reported that various member silk factories of our association have reported to the association that someone recently suggested to your committee to ban the transportation of dried cocoons purchased and stored by various silk factories in Jiangsu Province, and requested your committee to investigate the amount of cocoons stored in Jiangsu Province and the capacity of silk factories in Jiangsu Province to accommodate them. During the investigation period, the transportation of dry cocoons was temporarily prohibited, causing panic in Shanghai silk factories for raw materials. Even more fearful are the sources of workers' livelihoods. Please transfer the request to revoke the ban. I think that goods are valuable in circulation, so the ancients had people exchanging goods, so as to adjust the surplus to remedy the deficiency. Premier Sun Yat-sen considered the world to be public, removed the biases of territories, and allowed people to operate freely. It is recorded in the canons that there should be no parochialism. To separate Qin and Yue. Even things like cotton and wheat have never been heard of being investigated for the capacity of this province, but intercepted. If what the proposer requests is true, what is the difference between encouraging monopoly? Even if the prohibition of transportation is limited to the investigation period, the investigation is not a clearly defined period of time. It is always possible to disregard the need of Shanghai silk factories for cocoons, and the lives of tens of thousands of silk workers. Based on the previous report, I hereby issue a telegram, begging your committee to consider that the relationship is not limited to one party, and to give more consideration to this ban before it is issued, and to withdraw it after it has been issued. I cannot but pray for it."

A Meeting Will Be Held Today to Deliberate Petitioning

The Raw Materials Maintenance Committee of the association has scheduled a meeting of the committee at 6 PM today to decide on petitioning the Executive Yuan and other rescue measures. A reporter from Xin Sheng News met with a member of the committee yesterday, who said that the flour mills' purchasing of wheat, the textile mills' purchasing of cotton, and the linen mills' purchasing of hemp, are the same as the silk mills' pasturing of cocoons. If each raw material producing area must be self-sufficient and prohibit exports, then Shanghai will have no manufacturing factories. Therefore, it seems inappropriate for the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to ban the export of dried cocoons. If the export is prohibited to prevent dried cocoons from being transported overseas, the government can order the prohibition of exports. In short, Shanghai colleagues hope that the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will quickly revoke the ban to prevent Shanghai silk factories from shutting down and tens of thousands of workers from losing their jobs.

### Shandong Native Place Association Received Li Guang'an Yesterday

Reported on the Course of the Incident; Decided to Uphold the Central Government's Intentions

Since the North China Incident occurred, people from all walks of life have been paying close attention. In order to understand the truth of this incident and its future evolution, the Shandong Native Place Association in this port held a discussion meeting at the Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road at 4 PM yesterday, inviting Mr. Li Guang'an, Director of the 29th Army's Shanghai Office. The meeting was attended by Shandong Native Place Association President Zhang Yipeng, Deputy Military Commander Ma Dengying, guests from all walks of life, and Shandong natives Zhao Pinsan, Shang Mujiang, Zhang Yiqing, Wan Futian, Gao Shikui, Wang Shicheng, Zou Jixian, Wang Fengji, Yang Dezhi, and others, more than twenty people in total. First, Chairman Zhang Yipeng reported on the significance of inviting Mr. Li, briefly stating that the 29th Army is fighting for the survival of the country with their lives, determined to coexist with Lugou Bridge, which is admirable. In recent years, many people have not fully understood Chairman Song's hard work and difficulties in maintaining North China, but since the occurrence of this incident, we should be able to understand the true face of the 29th Army. Today, we specially invited Director Li to report on the course of this incident and Chairman Song's hard work in maintaining North China, etc. Subsequently, Li Guang'an rose to report on the internal evolution of North China in recent years and the truth about the Lugou Bridge Incident. Finally, he summarized the conclusion that this incident is by no means an isolated incident in Hebei and Chahar. Regardless of peace or war, Chairman Song will only follow the orders of the Central Government. As for the future evolution of this incident, since no report has been received, it is not possible to draw a conclusion rashly. But what can be said is that the 29th Army will uphold the will of the Central Government and the wishes of the entire people. He especially hopes that the press will write more encouraging articles and fewer stimulating remarks, so as not to fall into the enemy's trap. After Li's report, it was already 5:30 PM, and the meeting was adjourned with tea and refreshments.

### Songjiang Administration Submitted Fish Inspection Methods to the Ministry of Finance for Review

The Association Claims that the Order to Stop Opening Cabins to Sell Fish Refers to the Fact that the Fish in the Second Class Had Less Salt

The Ministry of Finance received a report from the Songjiang Administration, stating that the Qidong Fish and North Goods Trade Association requested changes to the fish and salt inspection methods, which were deemed appropriate. It ordered them to conduct inspections at any time to facilitate the fishing industry. A document from the Salt Affairs Administration stated, "The report submitted by the Songjiang Administration on the 436th of July 26, regarding the Qidong Fish and North Goods Trade Association's request to change the fish and salt inspection methods, has been found to be appropriate. The presentation to the Ministry of Finance has been noted. Since the Songjiang Administration has stated that the previous claims by the Qidong Fish and North Goods Trade Association that the fish and salt inspectors ordered the cessation of opening cabins to sell fish refers to the fact that the fish in the second class had more fish and less salt, the bureau has ordered all inspectors to consider the circumstances and make flexible arrangements for boats with more fish and less salt, and not to be overly demanding or difficult, nor to order the opening of cabins. The handling is very good. You are still to transfer the instructions to earnestly investigate and prevent difficulties at any time to facilitate the fishing industry. This order is issued by Minister Kong Xiangxi and Vice Minister Zou Lin."

### Sichuan Villagers Rescued Students from Disaster Areas Staying in Shanghai

Yesterday was the Deadline for Registration; It Has Been Decided to Extend the Deadline Starting Today

The Sichuan Shanghai Native Place Association has been registering students from Sichuan disaster areas. Yesterday was the deadline, but the association felt that Sichuan students receiving military training and serving in rural areas did not know about the registration, so only a small number of students from Datong, Faze, Tongde, etc. registered. The association decided to extend the deadline for another three weeks starting today to avoid any omissions, and stipulated that all students from severely affected areas in Sichuan whose families' support has been cut off must bring proof documents to be registered and then pooled for relief.

### Cracking Down on Cars Registered with Out-of-Province Licenses in the City

Since the implementation of car intercommunication among provinces and cities, car owners residing in this city often registered with other provinces and cities to avoid the higher tax rates in this city, and to favor the lighter ones. The municipal authorities, in view of the fact that the car intercommunication regulations stipulated the duration of stay, but it was difficult to check and crack down on them due to the inability to verify, which affected the car donation income, and caused difficulties in the management of car affairs, recently, the Finance, Police, and Public Works Bureaus specifically consulted and decided, "Any car licensed in the two special districts of this city (except for temporary transit permits) and simultaneously bearing licenses from other provinces and cities, driving within the city, will be cracked down on in accordance with the measures for punishing unregistered vehicles." It is heard that the aforementioned measures have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and filing, and will soon be published in the newspaper to notify all car owners, and letters will be sent to various provinces and cities and the National Highway Traffic Committee for review.

### Bund Bank Protection Levee Completed

Another Section Will Continue Construction Immediately; There Will Be a Large Tide Next Month

The bank protection levee built by the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau on the Bund will continue to be added, and the location has been determined. The details are as follows:

The First Section of the Water Levee Has Been Completed

The bank protection levee on the Bund from Edward Road in the south to Jiujiang Road in the east, which has been built by the Public Works Department, has now been completed. Only a small part of the outer surface of the levee needs to be slightly chiseled to make it more aesthetically pleasing.

Another Section Will Be Built

As for the section from Nanjing Road to Beijing Road on the Bund, the terrain of the bank protection is higher, so there is no need to build the same levee. However, from the northern end of the Beijing Road Bund to the Bund Park, the Public Works Department has also decided to continue adding a levee, which can be started in the coming days.

Large Tides Coming Next Month

Next month, autumn floods will begin. According to the Dredging Bureau's predictions, there will be large tides, especially the morning tides from the 6th to the 11th. According to measurements, the high tide on the 6th will be about eleven feet one and five inches, eleven feet nine inches on the 7th, eleven feet five and five inches on the 8th, twelve feet two inches on the 9th, eleven feet five and six inches on the 10th, and eleven feet zero five inches on the 11th. The height of the Bund Bank is only thirteen feet, and the water level is very close to the shore. If there is wind and rain, there is a possibility of overflowing the bank.

### Divorcee Requests Confirmation of Legitimate Child Case

Blood Types are All Q Type; Former Husband Requests Adoption

Wu Xuezhen, a young woman from Luanhu Township, Wubaosi Village, Minhang District, Shanghai County, was married to Hua Shaoxiang from Erjiasi Village in the same township for a short period. Due to incompatibility, they divorced by agreement last spring. At the time of the divorce, Wu Xuezhen was already pregnant. On October 20th of last year, Wu Xuezhen gave birth to a daughter at the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, named Hua Shaozi. Because Shaozi is indeed Hua Shaoxiang's child, Wu Xuezhen filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the local court last winter, requesting confirmation of the legitimate daughter. However, Hua Shaoqun insisted that Shaozi was not his biological child, but was born from Wu Xuezhen's adultery before the divorce. As a result, Hua Shaoxiang lost the lawsuit. Hua was dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. After an expert examination by the Forensic Medicine Research Institute, it was found that the blood types of Hua Shaoxiang and Wu Xuezhen were both Q type, and the blood type of Hua Shaozi was also Q type, so it was determined that there was a possibility of birth. Recently, Hua Shaoxiang filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the local court against Wu Xuezhen, requesting the return of the legitimate daughter, claiming that the plaintiff and the defendant were originally husband and wife, and after they divorced by agreement in March of last year, the defendant gave birth to a daughter in October of the same year, but has not yet returned her, and should be ordered to return her. The case was heard by Judge Zhu yesterday. The plaintiff did not attend, and was represented by a lawyer. The defendant also did not attend, and only delegated lawyer Zhang Shewo to the court, arguing that the defendant should be designated as the guardian. The official adjourned the hearing until another date because both parties were not present.

### The Da Kang Bank Suspended Business

Bank Runs Caused Illiquidity; A Post-Mortem Plan Pending Shareholders' Meeting

The Da Kang Bank on Ningbo Road suspended operations yesterday due to bank runs and the inability to recover loans, resulting in illiquidity. The Board of Directors decided to temporarily suspend operations from yesterday. All follow-up measures will be decided by the shareholders' meeting. The details are recorded below:

Temporary Suspension of Business

The Da Kang Bank was organized in February of the 23rd year of the Republic of China by Zhou Weishi, Zhang Qinbo, and others with a capital of 500,000 yuan, which was fully paid up at one time. The inaugural meeting was held on April 1 of the same year, and it was approved by both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry. It opened on August 1. The Chairman of the Board is Zhang Qinbo, and the Manager is Chen Gongfu. Its business is mainly commercial credit loans. Since the 24th year, due to the depression in commerce, it has been particularly cautious with various loans. Now, due to bank runs and the inability to recover loans, resulting in illiquidity, the Board of Directors decided to temporarily suspend operations from yesterday.

Follow-up Measures

From yesterday, the bank temporarily suspended operations in accordance with the Board of Directors' resolution. A reporter from Xin Sheng News learned from the bank yesterday that the total amount of fixed and current deposits is about 500,000 yuan, and the total amount of loans is about 1.4 million yuan. In the past week, it was rumored that the bank's operations with public bonds had failed, resulting in depositors running to withdraw their deposits. At the same time, due to the inability to recover loans, resulting in illiquidity, the bank was forced to suspend operations. All follow-up measures will be decided by the shareholders' meeting. As for the bank itself, it has not suffered losses. This time, it is really due to illiquidity.

### The First Special Court Accepted a Case of Tax Arrears by Spanish Nationals

The Spanish Consulate Closed, First Case

Spanish national Sang Caizhi, 35 years old, was sued by the Public Works Bureau in the First Special District Court for owing about 400 yuan in patrolman's tax. The court issued an arrest warrant and approved his detention in the Huade Road West Prison.

This is the first case of our court detaining Spanish nationals after the closure of the Spanish consulate.

### Blood Case on Wenzhou Road

Wu Rongqing Was Cut Seven or Eight Times; The Truth Is Still Difficult to Ascertain

Wu Rongqing, a native of Tiejiang, 28 years old, works as a staff member in the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road and has no family. Therefore, he usually resides at his brother Wu Siqi's residence at No. 6, Lane 157 (Hongjili), Wenzhou Road, in a small room. Yesterday morning, at about 7 AM, Wu Rongqing was just getting up to wash when more than a dozen men suddenly came to inquire. They learned that he had not gone out, and they swarmed upstairs and broke into the small room. One of the men pulled out a kitchen knife and slashed at Wu. Wu Rongqing was unable to dodge and was cut seven or eight times in the waist, abdomen, shoulders, and back, causing a lot of bleeding. He immediately fainted and fell to the ground. The perpetrators, seeing that their goal had been achieved, abandoned the knife and fled. By the time the landlord of the house got up and discovered the situation, the perpetrators had already fled without a trace. The landlord quickly reported to the Xin Zha Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate and immediately sent Wu to the hospital for treatment in an ambulance. His injuries were serious and his life was in danger. The murder weapon was taken to the police station for safekeeping, and detectives were ordered to pursue and arrest the perpetrators. The truth of the matter is still difficult to determine.

### First Cholera Stool Test

Reportedly, Cholera Occurred in Ningbo; Patient's Stool Specially Sent to Shanghai; Test Results to be Released Tomorrow

According to reports, the Harbor Quarantine Office paid great attention to the fact that cholera patients were discovered in Ningbo Port last week. However, since Ningbo does not have the equipment to test cholera blood serum, it is difficult to determine whether it is true. Therefore, the China-America Hospital in Ningbo specially sent the patient's stool specimen to Shanghai for testing while keeping it frozen. The Quarantine Office attached great importance to this matter and specially ordered Dr. Bo Lishi of the Wusong No. 2 Hospital to test it. According to the office, the test results are scheduled to be released this Saturday. The office also stated that the Port of Shanghai is currently very safe and there has been no discovery of cholera.

### Wu Shaoqin Accuses His Wife of Adultery After Cutting Ties with His Family

Two False Accusations Proven Untrue; Requests Publication of Verdict to Restore Reputation

Wu Shaoqin, a native of Nanhui residing at No. 5 Kangjili, Kangti Road in the French Concession (48 years old, a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine), is currently being prosecuted by Wang Guangquan, a prosecutor at the Shanghai District Court, on charges of false accusation. The prosecution alleges that Wu Shaoqin has a history of impropriety and excessive spending and has secretly taken a woman named Xiao as a concubine, neglecting his wife, Wu Jiangshi. His father, Wu Yiqin, allocated land and property to Wu Jiangshi in June of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China [1924], allowing her to live separately with her children. He also accused Wu Shaoqin of disobedience in the Nanhui County government. However, Wu Shaoqin, instead of repenting, harbored resentment towards Wu Jiangshi. In addition to filing a civil suit for cohabitation, which was entangled in litigation for three trials and ultimately rejected, he also accused Wu Jiangshi of adultery with Chen Zisheng, which resulted in a decision not to prosecute. On June 21 of this year, Wu Shaoqin falsely accused Wu Jiangshi of engaging in adultery with Chen Zisheng and filed a complaint with the Shanghai Municipal Police. The detective team of the police bureau dispatched officers to Wu Jiangshi's home at No. 246, Lane 2, Yangsi South Road, along with Wu Shaoqin, to search the premises, but they did not find any evidence of adultery between Wu Jiangshi and Chen Zisheng. Subsequently, Wu Jiangshi and Chen Zisheng filed separate lawsuits against Wu Shaoqin for false accusation. After investigation, it was found that the defendant and his wife, Wu Jiangshi, had a history of litigation due to the allocation of property and separate residence, which was on record. Furthermore, it was determined through investigation that there was no adultery between Wu Jiangshi and Chen Zisheng, and a decision not to prosecute was made and finalized. However, the defendant, harboring resentment towards Wu Jiangshi, fabricated accusations based on past events and filed a complaint with the Shanghai Municipal Police, which again found no evidence after a search. This clearly constitutes a deliberate false accusation and a violation of Article 169, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing presided over the second criminal court hearing. The plaintiff, Chen Zisheng, filed an ancillary private prosecution, requesting that the full text of the verdict be published in the newspaper to restore his reputation, which had been damaged by rumors. The plaintiff, Wu Jiangshi, retained attorney Fang Junjie and filed an ancillary civil lawsuit, requesting: 1) compensation of 800 yuan for attorney fees; 2) publication of the verdict in the newspaper to restore her reputation; and 3) punishment of the defendant. When questioned, the defendant, Wu Shaoqin, testified that the matter of catching the adulterer was discussed with attorney Lu Dingkui, who introduced him to detectives Chen Weibang and a Mr. Jiang. They went to his wife's house, but there was no one there. He and his wife had separated in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China [1924]. Chen Zisheng is the grandfather of his eldest daughter's husband, but he did not officiate at the wedding. He insisted that there was adultery and claimed that his father and others were talking because his father was also not entirely proper. The official asked, "According to you, your parents, wife, and others are all bad, and you are the only good one. Is this all fabricated?" He replied, "No." The official then asked, "Did you write a letter demanding money?" He replied, "No." At this point, Chen Zisheng and Wu Jiangshi stated separately that their daughter married Chen's grandson, and the grandfather officiated at the wedding. Wu Shaoqin, using Chen's name, secretly took a large sum of money, causing a feud. He is not good to his parents, so why would he care about his wife? He has bad intentions and wants to extort money. There was a letter demanding money, which is now in the case file. The court ordered the summons of the detectives for further questioning. Wu Shaoqin was released on his original bail.

### Hurricane Changes Course Towards Sea of Japan

Wind Direction Shifts from Northwest to Due North; Has Passed East of Luzon

The hurricane that originated from Guam Island in the Pacific Ocean had its wind direction changed from northwest to due north yesterday morning. At 6:00 AM, it had reached 22 degrees north latitude and 126 degrees east longitude, within a radius of 60 nautical miles. It has passed east of Luzon Island. If the direction of the hurricane remains unchanged, shifting from northwest to due north, it will likely move towards the Sea of Japan. The coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang in our country will be spared from its impact.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Protection of Maids Encouraged by League of Nations

The Expert Advisory Committee on Slavery Issues of the League of Nations issued a report stating that the committee is greatly encouraged by the Shanghai Municipal Council's work in protecting maids. While formulating or implementing regulations regarding this work is difficult, the committee is confident that these difficulties can be overcome. The committee would be grateful if the Shanghai Municipal Council could submit a report by the end of the year and would be greatly interested in any news regarding maid shelters or relief centers.

### Chen Jiufeng Convicted of Fraud and Sentenced

Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment Yesterday; Wang Shuangcai and Others Sentenced to Detention

Chen Jiufeng, an Executive Committee member of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession and a Standing Committee member of the 39th District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, was suspected of illegally organizing a road workers' mutual aid society, collecting membership fees, and instigating Wang Shuangcai, Li Guilin, and Cui Yuliang to obstruct road work. The police arrested Chen along with Wang and the other three and prosecuted them in the First Special Court. The details of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Fengqi presided over the second criminal court hearing of this case. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, stated that the witness Zhu Lansheng, whom the court needed to summon, had been ordered by the police to be brought in, but Zhu had gone to Ningbo and was not in Shanghai, so he could not be brought to court today. When questioned, Wang Shuangcai, Li Guilin, and Cui Yuliang all denied obstructing road work or committing assault. Chen Jiufeng testified that the road workers' mutual aid society was not organized by him and that he was only one of the clerks of the society. He said that the workers joined the Citizens' Federation voluntarily because they could not bear the oppression of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The membership fees ranged from two jiao to twenty yuan, so the workers' payment of four jiao was in accordance with the rules of the society. Chen's defense lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Wang Jian'e, submitted an official letter from the Municipal Party Headquarters to prove that the road workers' mutual aid society was not organized by Chen Jiufeng. They also requested to summon four road workers who were present in court to prove Chen's relationship with the society. Judge Zhan examined the evidence and deemed it unnecessary to question the witnesses requested by Chen's lawyers. He ordered the commencement of the debate. However, Chen's lawyers argued that all evidence favorable to the defendant should be presented, but the court did not allow it. Chen's lawyers then requested the clerk to record the defendant's requests in the minutes. After mutual debate between the police lawyer, Jiang, and Chen's and Wang's lawyers, Wang Shuangcai, Li Guilin, and Cui Yuliang were sentenced to thirty-five days of detention each for jointly causing bodily harm, with the option of commuting the sentence to a fine of one yuan per day. Chen Jiufeng was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for repeatedly using fraudulent means to obtain property. The remaining charges were found not guilty. He was detained during the appeal period.

### Silver and Money Industry Invites Qian Junrui to Lecture on North China Issue

Lecture Title: "North China Today"

Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the Silver and Money Industry Association has sent telegrams to General Song Zheyuan to encourage him and has enthusiastically raised funds from its members to support the 29th Army. To enable its members to have a correct understanding of the Sino-Japanese issue and to understand the current status of North China, the association has scheduled a lecture by Mr. Qian Junrui on "North China Today" at 7:00 PM on July 24 at the association.

### Bankruptcy Administrator Accused of Debt Registration Dispute

Defendant Claims It Was a Share Payment, Not a Debt; Files Counterclaim for One Yuan in Damages

Li Ding, the accountant and bankruptcy administrator of Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory Co., Ltd., and the auditors, Zhou Baokang and Liu Huchen, have recently been sued in the First Special Court by Lu Jiasheng for criminal breach of trust. The details of their initial interrogation have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing presided over a renewed hearing of this case in the second criminal court. According to the plaintiff, Lu Jiasheng, he held a judgment document issued by the court in the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936] under case number Yi 1646, which had been finalized. He registered it with the defendant, Li Ding's accounting firm, according to the law, and a registration certificate was approved and issued. He then received consecutive notices to attend conciliation and creditors' meetings. Zhou and Liu were the bankruptcy auditors of Jingfeng. Unexpectedly, he then received a notice from Li Ding, stating that his debt of 500 yuan was not a deposit but a share payment and could not be registered as a debt and should be canceled. He immediately replied, stating that the defendants had no right to change the court's finalized legal judgment and demanding that they specify a date for payment within 24 hours. However, the defendants ignored him, which constitutes a violation of duty and a violation of Article 342 of the Criminal Law, and should be punished according to the law. He also filed an ancillary civil lawsuit, requesting an order to repay 200 yuan in national currency and statutory interest until the date of execution. When questioned, Li Ding testified that the registrar issued the registration certificate when the plaintiff came to his office to apply for registration. He did not see the judgment document. Later, based on the report of the creditor representative, which indicated that the plaintiff's payment was a share payment and not a debt, he sent a letter notifying the cancellation of the registration but asked him to provide further evidence. However, the plaintiff rashly filed a criminal lawsuit. Liu Huchen was absent. According to Zhou Baokang, the plaintiff's payment was a share payment and not a deposit. As the auditor, he naturally reported the facts. Now, the plaintiff can file a civil request for a ruling because the creditor's qualifications are in question. However, he rashly filed a criminal complaint, which constitutes false accusation. Therefore, he filed a counterclaim for false accusation and an ancillary civil lawsuit, requesting an order to compensate him and Liu Huchen for damages of one yuan each and to publish the verdict of this case in the newspaper. After debate between the lawyers of both parties, the court ordered the debate in this case to be concluded and set the pronouncement of the verdict for 9:00 AM on the 28th.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday was: Shandong and surrounding areas are cloudy and hot, with localized thunderstorms or fog, and northeast to southeast winds.

Its center was at noon within about 60 miles of 23 degrees north latitude and 127 degrees east longitude. The wind force is unknown. Also, the highest temperature in this city in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was 94.1 degrees, and the lowest was 75.0 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 92.8 degrees, and the lowest was 74.8 degrees.

Talks

### Elucidation of "Respond to War"

— Nai Yi

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his second speech at the Lushan Talks, said that the development of the Lugou Bridge Incident is related to the entire issue of the Chinese nation, and whether this matter can be concluded is the realm of the final juncture." He also said, "If it comes to the final juncture, we can only stake the lives of the entire nation to seek the survival of the country. At that time, we will no longer be allowed to compromise halfway. We must know that the conditions for compromising halfway are the conditions for complete surrender and complete destruction. The most important thing for the people of the whole country is to recognize the meaning of the so-called final juncture. Once the final juncture arrives, we can only sacrifice to the end and resist to the end. Only by sacrificing to the end can we win the final victory. If we are hesitant and delusional about temporary peace, we will plunge the nation into an abyss of eternal doom!" And "From the course of this incident, we know how deliberately the other side is plotting against us, and peace cannot be easily obtained." Therefore, if we want peace and tranquility at present, we can only allow the other side's troops to enter and exit our territory without restriction, while our own troops must be restricted and unable to freely station themselves in our own territory, or if the other side's troops fire at the Chinese army, we cannot return fire. In other words, it is "others are the knife and chopping board, and we are the fish and meat." And in this way, we are about to reach this extremely tragic state in the world, which "no nation with even a little bit of personality in the world can endure!"

Such a solemn and resolute expression is what the people have been running around and calling for for several years. Once heard, it is no wonder that they are indescribably inspired and celebrate the day when shame will be avenged. However, it is unexpected that when those with blood and energy are just "happily listening to the national policy has been decided, and especially celebrating that the way to ask for service has been opened" (see Li Bai's telegram), the news comes that the "our own troops" in the Lugou Bridge and Wanping area have already been "withdrawing on orders"!

The reason why the North China authorities arbitrarily withdrew the troops of the 37th Division and replaced them with security teams is said to be "to express a peaceful resolution in order to promote the other side's enlightenment." "Enlightenment" and the need to "promote" it makes it impossible for the common people to fathom its profoundness, and when compared with the position expressed by the government, "the 29th Army cannot be subject to any restrictions in the area where it is now stationed," it is even more impossible not to suspect that the "eternal sinners" have a prior agreement! Otherwise, why withdraw troops!

However, what is the effect of the so-called "promoting the other side's enlightenment"? The Beijing dispatch in this newspaper on the 21st said: "When our security team went to Lugou Bridge to replace the defense, they saw that the Japanese army's surveillance was extremely aggressive. The Japanese army not only showed no signs of retreating, but also had a stubborn attitude..." It seems that this is probably another set of "others' troops enter and exit our territory without restriction, while our own troops are restricted and cannot freely station themselves" tricks. With this result, "peace and tranquility" is indeed "peace and tranquility," but what about "others are the knife and chopping board, and we are the fish and meat"!

And to test whether the Japanese side intends to provoke, one first withdraws one's own troops. This is also a very absurd behavior and excuse. "From the course of this incident, we know how deliberately the other side is plotting against us" has already been heard and digested. Do we really still need to test whether "today's Hebei-Chahar" will become "yesterday's Northeast provinces"?

We are indeed a weak country, but we must maintain the life of our nation, and we must bear the historical responsibility left to us by our ancestors. Therefore, when it is absolutely necessary, we must respond to war." Now, the "consistent" and "must defend with all our strength" "minimum" four-point position announced by the government has been damaged. Isn't this still "when it is absolutely necessary"? "The other side's troops enter and exit our territory without restriction," and even arrive limitlessly and build fortifications everywhere, and then bombard and shoot as they please. Isn't this again "when it is absolutely necessary"?

Otherwise, when will we "respond to war" again? And does the so-called "respond to war" mean another name for "only resist but not retaliate"?

Of course not!

Then, good, we will wait and see whether it is "compromise halfway" or "resist to the end." And the people will also decide their actions from this fork in the road.

### Peace? Enlightenment?

— Warrior

Song Zheyuan, Shi Yousan, and others replied to the letter from the National Renaissance Association, "expressing their great determination regarding the North China incident, vowing to resist the enemy to the death, and not hesitating to make any sacrifice." This has already been seen in yesterday's newspapers. However, the Beijing dispatch on the 21st said, "The local authorities have consistently advocated a peaceful resolution to the Lugou Bridge Incident. On the morning of the 21st, they ordered the troops stationed in various places west and north of Lugou Bridge to temporarily retreat one or two li, and the defenses left behind will be successively taken over by Shi Yousan's security team. Cheng Xixian, the commander of the first brigade of the security team, led his troops to take over the defenses starting at 10:00 AM on the 21st. If the Japanese army does not attack our security team during the handover period, the handover can be completed by 12:00 PM. According to relevant sources, our side's advance withdrawal of troops this time is to demonstrate the ironclad evidence of peace and to promote the Japanese side's enlightenment. If the Japanese army still does not comply with the agreement to withdraw after our troops withdraw, their deliberate provocation will be seen by the whole world, and if the unfortunate incident expands, the responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side.

The Japanese's "deliberate provocation" has already been "seen by the whole world." Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said in his second speech at the Lushan Talks, "Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, some people may think it was accidental, but in the past month, the other side's discussions or direct and indirect expressions in diplomacy have made us realize the signs of the incident, and before and after the incident, there were also various news spread, saying that they wanted to expand the scope of the Tanggu Agreement, to expand the pseudo-organization of eastern Hebei, to expel the 29th Army, and to force Ning Zheyuan to leave, such news is countless, it is conceivable that this incident is not accidental." Are the public officials of Hebei and Chahar, who are on the front line, still not clear? And let's look at another urgent telegram on the morning of the 22nd: "Our troops stationed in Babao Mountain withdrew at 7:20 PM on the 21st. When they withdrew, the Japanese army fired six more shells..." To continue to "demonstrate peace" and to continue to "promote the Japanese enlightenment" is to "hand over" the entire China...

Not only that, but this "compliance with the agreement to withdraw troops" also violates the will of the central government. I don't know whether the "agreement" complied with this time is verbal or written. Is it based on the will of the central government or the personal will of the public officials of Hebei and Chahar? The matter has reached the "final juncture. I hope the public officials of Hebei and Chahar will give us (450 million people) a clear indication. At the same time, I hope the central government will resolutely take the four points announced by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to resolve the Lugou Bridge incident as the basis for negotiations. Otherwise, there is only war! Anyone who "abandons even an inch of land and sovereignty" is "an eternal sinner of the Chinese nation!"

### Should Lending Stop?

— Hu Yiang

Whether lending should stop has been clearly explained in the "Talks" on the 19th! "We know that the effect of consolation is more accurately said to be spiritual encouragement than material assistance, and the exchange of information with the anti-enemy brothers on the front line through a small amount of material media is even more precedented, then the donation movement can stop! What we want to express is precisely that outside of the limited number of brothers on the front line, there is still a unified public standing behind them, and the front line and the rear have already closely joined hands!" Now, Mr. Hu Yiang has put forward two more valuable opinions, which are published below:

(On the Road)

1.  It is easier to transport goods than to transport money. The first simple method, I think, is to change the "donation movement" to a "goods donation movement," that is, the rear public, who originally took "money" to comfort the soldiers on the front line, can change to "goods" to assist the soldiers on the front line, which seems more appropriate. For example, if the front line lacks a kind of poison gas protection tool, we can take out the money we are willing to donate to purchase poison gas protection tools. Also, if the front line needs medicines or food, we can also enthusiastically purchase and prepare a large number of applicable medicines or food at any time. However, in order to avoid supply and demand imbalance, we may as well allow the public to automatically purchase and donate any goods (limited to military necessities). One side should be transported and supported. One the other hand, a similar "People's Circles Transport Goods to Support Military Movement Committee" office should be jointly organized by local public organizations, and the duties it undertakes are to constantly communicate with the front line, find out what things are needed, and know how much is needed. Then, report to the public in the rear by various methods, and purchase and donate the required items on a specific day, collect them, and transport them to the front line. At the same time, if you want to make procurement convenient and practical, you can still maintain the donation method, just bulk purchase all the items required by the front line with all the donations. Then, although what the rear public directly donates is still "money," what Liu Qianfeng enjoys is already the appropriate "goods."

2.  The safekeeping and distribution of donations The second feasible method is that when the donation movement does not stop, if it is as above, you only need to easily purchase goods with money. However, this is only the use of part of the donations. We know that any extension or expansion of the war, what the army needs is definitely not only on the side of goods. According to past experiences, such as the treatment and burial of wounded and dead officers and soldiers, the aftermath of the families of dead officers and soldiers, the organization of rescue teams, and the organization of public military transportation teams, none of which are the responsibilities that the rear public should bear, and none of which can be helped without money. Therefore, the safekeeping and distribution of donations from all parties should be handled by a reliable office committee jointly formed by local public groups and personnel from the front line army to handle various urgent matters cautiously and fairly. Then, we can both avoid the unnecessary words "donations cannot reach the lower-level soldiers directly, etc." and remove the accidental malpractices caused by improper safekeeping and distribution of "consolation money."

Incidentally, we can choose one of the above two methods to handle the consolation donations that have been returned by the 29th Army.

### By the Iron Furnace

— Rural Dweller

Those blacksmiths are truly punctual. As soon as the rice seedlings are planted, they arrive as promised. They arrived on the day of "Lesser Heat," a group of seven or eight. Furnace, anvil, bellows, awning, large and small iron hammers; these tools have followed them to countless docks and traveled countless journeys, exposed to sun and night dew, enduring the attacks of storms. However, they, like their masters, showed no signs of decline, weakness, or fatigue. The blacksmiths' sturdy bodies, hard chestnut-like arms, broad chests, thick eyebrows, and spirited eyes were full of a calm strength. The hall-sized furnace, the large "Fortune" character on the furnace, the heavy iron hammer, and the smooth wooden handle worn by friction on the hammer all gave people a sense of power. I stood at the factory gate, watching them and their tools enter the ancestral hall.

The ancestral hall became lively again. The men and women of the village all wanted to learn about the situation and news from other places from these travelers who came once a year, especially news about the foreign devils, believing that they were all northerners and the news must be plentiful and reliable. Everyone held their bowls of porridge and rice, surrounding the iron furnace, eating and listening, interjecting a few words whenever they had the chance. At first, they always talked about business and asked about prices. Everyone complained that farming tools were expensive this year. A four-pronged hoe cost five or six dimes, which had never happened before. "Alas, not to mention bean cake fertilizer, even iron tools are soaring in price. It's really hard to expect success from farming..." They all sighed like this.

Blacksmith boss Wang Laowu had such a straightforward temper: "Don't say that I, Laowu, am black-hearted and lack friendship. No matter how the price rises, it's not my turn to get rich. The foreign devils have ulterior motives and are causing trouble, sending people everywhere to buy copper and iron, even scrap iron. They offer high prices and buy as much as they can..."

The ignorant Third Granny interrupted and asked, "What kind of tools do they need so much iron to make? Do they use iron rakes, iron hoes, and sickles for farming?"

"...Don't even mention that! They use it all to make cannons and bombs. After they started buying, the price of iron suddenly became expensive. It's not like I'm raising the price just for the sake of it. The cost is too high. What else can I do but do business at a loss? I can't support two wives, hehehe..."

These words made everyone burst into laughter. When the laughter subsided, Lao Long, the man with a full beard in the third room, leaned against the door frame and said seriously, "The Chinese are so spineless, selling iron to the foreign devils, letting them make guns and cannons to kill us, to bomb our cities and houses. It's not that I, Lao Long, am stubborn, but even if the foreign devils used gold to exchange for my old ironware, I would definitely embarrass them." He raised his fist.

Donggua, who was perched on a long bench sharpening a knife blade, turned to look at Lao Long: "The foreign devils aren't as sincere as you, coming out to collect iron in person. There are always those who swallow arsenic with their eyes closed, those conscienceless people, helping them. Their eyes are only fixed on bright, stinky money, with no ancestors, no descendants, acting as spies everywhere. They do things that others can't do. Not to mention helping the foreign devils buy iron, they even turn around and kill their own Chinese people. How can you defend against that? What if I were a spy, coming here to ask for directions, who would know!"

"If you were a spy, damn it, I would have beaten you flat long ago!" The long-necked blacksmith raised a large iron hammer and slammed it hard in the air above the anvil. The sound of iron hitting iron burst out sparks. The long-necked blacksmith gritted his teeth, as if he were really hitting a spy. That appearance again caused everyone to laugh. Donggua had become the target of everyone's criticism, truly like a spy. Some reached out to pat his bald head: "Let's all beat the spy!" Even the children excitedly gathered around.

"This is really no laughing matter. If the Chinese want to live upright lives, they must drive out the foreign devils and kill the spies. They have good artillery and powerful weapons, but when they see the big knife team, they are scared out of their wits. They are really spineless, running away and begging for mercy. This ugly state makes people feel disgusted. In this situation, there's no way to make a living by making iron tools. It's better to simply make big knives and let the soldiers kill a few more foreign devils, letting them know that the Chinese are not weaklings and are afraid of death. If you want to stand out, you have to fight!" The more Wang Laowu spoke, the more energetic he became, spraying saliva. The molten fire in the iron furnace shone on his sturdy muscles, emitting a glow of strength. I was almost moved to shout wildly.
