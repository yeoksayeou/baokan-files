### Japanese Military Issues Note to Hebei-Chahar Authorities

[Tianjin] A large-scale war in North China is difficult to avert, as Matsui notified Song Zheyuan at midnight, saying that Japan, in view of the Chinese army's lack of sincerity in fulfilling the agreement, had no choice but to take independent action. Matsui (now a representative of Japanese Army Commander-in-Chief Kashii Kogoro) listed the Chinese army's repeated provocative actions, such as the shooting of Japanese soldiers at Guang'anmen, which were insulting and unforgivable to the Japanese army. Matsui demanded that all Chinese troops in Beiping withdraw, saying that the presence of Chinese troops in Beiping would cause chaos and war, endangering the city and the lives of foreigners living in Beiping.

### Issue of Joint Protest to Japan by Britain, the United States, and France

Relevant Parties Are Seeking Opinions; Time Not Yet Ripe for Nine-Power Treaty Conference

[London] The Langfang battle has been reported in large headlines by newspapers here, and all parties are paying great attention to it. However, the British side seems to still regard this as a local incident. The issue of a joint protest to Japan by Britain, the United States, and France is currently under consideration. It is said that France is very active in favor of a joint protest, but the United States is willing to stay out of it in order to take any independent action. Britain still believes that Japan aspires to peace, but is constrained by overbearing militarists, so it feels that friendly mediation is the best approach.

### Traitor Captured in Miluo

Confesses to Many Accomplices

[Changsha] Xu Guoshen, a traitor, was captured by the Yuehan Railway in Miluo. After being handed over to Wang, the commander of the garrison regiment of the railway, for interrogation, he confessed that he was 32 years old, from Macheng, Hubei, and had served as a clerk in a certain army for many years. After his dismissal, he was lured and introduced into a traitor group by Li Qiangsheng and Hu Jincai in March of this year. After two months of training by the Japanese, he was assigned to the Aohan Railway to scout military intelligence, sabotage transportation, and other tasks. There were a total of seven accomplices, divided into several groups of two people each, distributed in Changsha, Guangzhou, Hengyang, Yueyang, Shaoguan, Wuchang, Lechang, and other major stations or cities. This time, he was ordered by the Japanese to come to scout the bridges in the Changyue area and attempted to blow up the railway bridges at Changsha, Miluo, and Nanjin Port at the end of this month. Wang Dayou and Wang Yuming were also assigned to work at Nanjin Port. The two were both from Jiangsu, dressed in plain clothes, and their secret sign was to hide two copper coins in the palm of their left hand and a burning cigarette between the ring finger and pinky finger of their right hand, or to proceed with a white towel on their head or white paper in their hand, appearing at noon every day at twelve o'clock in order for our party to transmit messages and be recognized. Sometimes they also disguised themselves as vendors at the station to facilitate their activities. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)

### American Newspapers Harshly Criticize Japanese Soldiers

The Only Country Threatening Peace in East Asia; Japan Should Bear the Blame for This Unfortunate Situation

[New York] American newspapers all carried news of the battles of Langfang, Guang'anmen, and Tongzhou on the front page. The Washington authorities announced that the United States and France and Britain had instructed their ambassadors to China and Japan to express to the Chinese and Japanese governments the hope of avoiding war. However, important newspapers here, such as the New York Times and the New York Tribune, today published editorials harshly criticizing the attitude of Japanese soldiers, saying that Japanese soldiers have repeatedly adopted aggressive tactics, which has chilled American public opinion. The New York Times editorial, in discussing Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's speech to the Diet, said that Hirota's so-called Japanese policy of seeking stability in East Asia through cooperation and coordination between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" was, in their view, nothing but empty rhetoric. After issuing this official statement, Japan then used heavy artillery, hand grenades, and rifles outside of Beiping, which was a great error. Japan claims its mission is to maintain its position as a force for stability in East Asia, but in reality, Japan is the only country threatening peace in East Asia. The newspaper continued that Japan, under the pretext of the Lugouqiao Incident on July 7, was attempting to coerce the Chinese government into giving up its jurisdiction over Hebei-Chahar and requesting cooperation from the Japanese army to eliminate the communists. All of this shows that Japan's so-called "stability" is actually "hegemony." The actions Japan is currently taking are making cooperation between China and Japan impossible. Japan has repeatedly stimulated the emotions of the Chinese people and disregarded the sovereignty of Chinese territory, brewing this unfortunate situation, and Japan should bear the blame. It is ridiculous that Japanese Prime Minister Konoe called on China to reconsider and exercise restraint on Sunday, because the Japanese cabinet is now allowing Japanese soldiers in North China to arbitrarily issue ultimatums to China. Finally, the newspaper said that Hirota expressed the hope that the great powers would fully understand Japan's patience and restraint. This tone is optimistic, because all countries except Germany or Italy have expressed deep concern to Japan. The demands made by Japan will plunge the Far East into war. This is an open secret. Japan has mistakenly believed that all countries have expressed approval for Japan's policy of invading China since the conflict with the Soviet Union caused a serious crisis. This is a misinterpretation of the attitude of Western countries by Japan. The New York Tribune editorial said that Japan believes that replacing the "belligerent" division of the Chinese army with a more moderate division would prevent incidents from breaking out even if the Japanese army continued to conduct night exercises. This is far from the truth. In the Guang'anmen Incident, a Japanese officer ordered the army to move from Fengtai to the scene of the incident. If the officer was not trying to cause trouble, he was simply foolish. In short, no matter what Chinese army is stationed there, it cannot avoid incidents from happening. The newspaper concluded that the peace that North China can enjoy, or rather the fact that peace cannot be maintained in North China, is because Japan does not want peace.

### Lushan Conference Chairman Wang's Speech Original Text

The Second Conference Concludes Today

[Kuling] The second Lushan Conference was held at 9:00 AM on the 28th in the lecture hall of the Kuling Library. At 9:00 AM sharp, Chairman Wang, the convener of the conference, arrived on time. A total of 72 guests and participants attended (the list is the same as yesterday). Chairman Wang delivered a speech (the original text is as follows: Esteemed guests, today we gather together. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for traveling from afar and offering your valuable advice. The purpose of initiating this joint conference with Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has already been explained in the first joint conference. For the sake of time, all the introductions from the first joint conference have been extracted for your perusal and will not be repeated here. The discussions expressed by the guests in the first joint conference have been carefully recorded. Although they have not yet been fully organized, the topics discussed will be brought up from time to time for your reference. Written materials will also be extracted as needed. Therefore, the materials for the second joint conference may be even richer than the first. The joint conference covers issues of politics, diplomacy, economy, and education, all of which are of great importance to the nation and society, and are of particular concern to both countries. Nothing is of greater concern to you all than the current situation. The sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge has focused the attention of all the guests in the first joint conference on this point. Now the situation is expanding and needs to be resolved urgently. Fortunately, Mr. Chiang has clearly announced the policy and determination to deal with the current situation in the first joint conference. All compatriots across the country must move forward with a united determination and a clear policy, without avoiding any difficulties or shirking any sacrifices. Since the September 18th Incident, our government and people have endured unbearable pain and humiliation, seeking only a period of peace to complete the task of building a modern nation. This task of building a modern nation is not only a need for China itself, but also a common hope of the international community. We believe that the completion of this task will also benefit Japan without harming it, because coexistence and co-prosperity are the common interests of mankind. For this reason, we have for many years endured with the greatest patience, hoping that China and Japan would sincerely join hands one day. But today, we have reached the final critical moment. Beyond this step, the fate of the nation and the people will fall into an abyss from which they will never recover. Therefore, we cannot but face this final critical moment with a united determination. We have been engaged in strengthening our national power on a daily basis, accumulating every bit of strength, for fear of not using it to the fullest. Today, we must be prepared to use all the gains we have accumulated for this final critical moment. Our army has no division between central and local forces. For years, we have been committed to unification, so that in the event of war, the entire army can be like a body using its arms and arms using its fingers, so that our blood will not be shed in vain. We have heard some divisive words, but we can prove them with facts. For example, when Shanxi and Suiyuan were in danger last year, when the central government sent troops to aid them, were there not many rumors? But later, the facts proved that the troops originally stationed in the area were encouraged by the arrival of the reinforcements, and the reinforcements were extremely kind and sincere to the troops originally stationed in the area. Such sharing of joys and sorrows, sharing of weal and woe, and seamless cooperation, has created a period of history of defending the territory and resisting the enemy. It was not long ago, and everyone can remember it. This proves that all loyal and brave soldiers who can do their best to defend the territory and resist the enemy will have their hearts and souls united as one, and no divisive tactics can be applied. Another example is that Yu Xuezhong could not settle in the Hebei government, so he was transferred to Gansu; Shang Zhen could not settle in the Hebei government, so he was transferred to Henan. The government was certainly very sad, but it did not allow them to lose their jobs or their troops to be displaced. This painstaking effort has also been understood by the people of the world. All of this is enough to prove that all loyal and brave soldiers who can do their best to defend the territory and resist the enemy, even if they encounter misfortune, as long as the country still has a piece of land left, this piece of land is their last foothold, and it is also the place where they can do their best for the country. The government will certainly provide food and clothing, and the people of the whole country will certainly provide food and drink. This is a wish from sincere unity, and no divisive tactics can be applied. Finally, one more sentence: At this final critical moment, we are a weak country, we are citizens of a weak country, and we have nothing to rely on, except for this spirit of sacrificing ourselves for the country. We encourage ourselves with it, and we encourage each other with it. If we are all willing to sacrifice ourselves for the country, then the final victory will be ours, because the reason why the aggressors dare to invade is nothing more than to occupy our land, enslave our people, make our people serve them, and use our land. If the result of the invasion is only a land full of corpses and ruins, then what is the use of the invasion? If everyone is like this, everywhere is like this, then the invaders will eventually have to turn back. We must have this united determination to move forward towards this clear policy. Today, I have spoken a few words about the current situation and my feelings. I am willing to accept your valuable opinions on all policies. After Chairman Wang finished his speech, guests such as Ren Qishan, Wu Kang, Xu Shilian, Wang Yunsheng, Zhang Yi, Wu Nanxuan, Pan Xulun, and Hong Shen successively expressed their opinions on the situation in the north. They all agreed that the government's established policy announced by President Jiang at the first conference and Chairman Wang's speech today should be upheld and fought for by the whole country. Everyone believed that since the government and the people are of one mind and are fighting for the final critical moment, it is even more necessary to unify, organize, and discipline local work in the future. Some cited historical facts from Germany, France, and the United States for reference, and some reported on the work of people's organizations during the Shanghai Incident for reference. As for the specialized issues that could not be fully discussed during the talks, they planned to write them into written form and send them to the Secretariat for transmission to the Chairman and distribution to the government authorities for reference and discussion. At 11:30 AM, Chairman Wang stood up, thanked everyone, and announced the adjournment of the meeting. From 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM in the afternoon, free talks were held separately in the economic, financial, and educational groups. (Central News Agency, 28th)

As for the confessions of Hu Dahai and Zhou Shiping, they also mostly relied on quibbling. As for Xu Yaoying's confession, although it was slightly vague, her situation seemed excusable. After the defendants were questioned, the presiding judge announced that the case was considered to have evidence that should be investigated further. After the investigation is completed, the hearing will be rescheduled, and the minutes will be read out on the morning of the 31st. Then Li Huaicheng's defense lawyer Chen Yaodong stood up and requested the court to issue an oral order to stop the defendant's detention and allow bail.

Current Commentary

### Establishing a Wartime System

— Yong

Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, more than ten days have passed. During these ten days, the Japanese army has been pressing forward step by step. At first, they treated us with arrogance, then lured us with troop movements, and finally occupied Langfang, issuing an ultimatum demanding that we withdraw our troops. Our authorities have been trying to defend our territory and maintain peace, but to no avail. The people of the whole country and the soldiers stationed on the front lines have already expressed their generosity and righteous indignation, vowing to defend our national rights and eliminate this fierce flame. When Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's declaration was issued, the limits were set and the national policy was clarified. The people and the government have strengthened their mutual trust and prepared calmly. Those who hope for resistance and hate the enemy are taking different paths to the same goal.

The peaceful situation broke down at midnight on the 27th, and battles broke out in various suburbs of Pingjin. Since the authorities have exhausted their efforts for peace, they should move on to responding to the war. The 29th Army, recalling the Battle of Xifeng Pass in those years, is ready to use its remaining courage. As soon as the commander issues the order to mobilize, they will all gather like clouds and advance at full speed. The heroism of the national heroes is bursting forth. Sure enough, within a day, Langfang and Fengtai were both brought under control. Recovering lost territory is a small start that has already achieved results. Chairman Song Zheyuan's command is calm and decisive, and the whole country is cheering and cheering.

However, now that the prelude to the war has begun, the people's responsibility is even greater. Before yesterday, they did their best to hope for the authorities. From today onwards, they should do their best to dedicate themselves to the country with loyalty. Hot blood like a tide should not be entirely devoted to words and writing, but should also be sought in facts. The so-called modern war calls for national unity and responds with national mobilization. Once something happens, the wartime system will immediately organize the old and young of the whole country to participate separately. This is something that knowledgeable people have already thought deeply about and researched. Now, it is time to see it put into practice.

The establishment of the so-called wartime system first lies in the careful planning of the leaders, and then in the allocation and organization of each unit. Both of these should be in line with the national conditions and should be based on facts. The government should be responsible for promoting it. As for the people, of course, every member is in this system as an active cell. Although the cells are small, their connection to the health of life is extremely important. Although the gears are small, their effect in driving the operation of this machine is extremely significant. If the people do not abandon themselves and want to achieve the final victory in the war, they should do their best in the system.

At present, the government is organizing the people step by step. However, since everything in wartime is in an extraordinary state, the organization should also be based on responding to the extraordinary. Everything from the stability of the rear economy, the transportation of food, the increase in production, the replenishment of materials, to the knowledge of street fighting and air defense, is related to the war on the front lines. Things that can be done leisurely in normal times should be done at full speed and with combined efforts in wartime. Everything should be centered on the war, and everything should be subject to extraordinary control. And those who control it must make it possible for the people to do it, so that the matter can be sustained and its effectiveness can be easily exerted.

As for the people's response to the war, in short, there is a distinction between direct and indirect. Direct ones, such as battlefield rescue, are as urgent as a fire. The organization should be stepped up immediately so that the soldiers on the front lines who are unfortunately injured can be treated. Indirect ones, such as enhancing efficiency in their respective duties, can be used to increase the strength of the country's wealth to meet the current difficulties. This is why the wartime system is established. Now that the war has begun, victory can be expected. The way to win is based on this. The strategists should not be mistaken.

### British House of Commons Passes Army, Navy, and Air Force Budgets

Wartime National Organization Formulates Plan; Defense of Western Mediterranean Safe

[London] The House of Commons recently discussed the budgets of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the afternoon, and finally passed the Army Department's budget with 325 votes against 7, the Navy Department's budget with 325 votes against 8, and the Aviation Department's budget with 327 votes against 7. When voting, the government obtained a very large majority because the opposition Labor Party abstained. The House of Commons will hold a debate today on the adjustment of the work of the three defense departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the wartime national organization. (Havas, 27th)

[London] Minister for the Coordination of Defense Inskip stated the measures to be taken in preparation for the dangerous period, saying that all plans, regardless of where the war takes place, are first formulated by committees of experts and approved by the General Staff. Those that have not been approved are currently under consideration by the government. Those who questioned Inskip today included Sir Sinclair, the leader of the Free Opposition Party, Smith, and Churchill. Churchill was particularly concerned about the situation in the Mediterranean, and Inskip repeatedly stated that the guns outside Gibraltar were not a threat to Gibraltar, and that two of the original four Howitzer cannons had been removed. The number and size of the cannons in Algeciras (near the British Gibraltar in southern Spain) were not as powerful as the Gibraltar fortress, so the government did not feel the need to panic. Inskip also said that the military preparations in Ceuta (in Spanish Morocco, across the sea from Gibraltar) were very adequate, but the heavy artillery there could not threaten Gibraltar or the navigation there. Inskip also stated the content of the organization of the Imperial Defense Committee, saying that the Prime Minister was the only permanent member, and since 1935, the people consulted by the committee included soldiers, sailors, aviators, industrialists, economists, politicians, etc., no less than 500 people. (Reuters, 27th) Finally, the opposition Liberal Party proposed an amendment requesting a reduction in the salary of the Minister for the Coordination of Defense. This was because the opposition parties expressed their disapproval of the government's habitual practices, but the House of Commons finally rejected the amendment with 306 votes against 14. The debate ended. (Havas, 37th)

### Non-Intervention Issue Still Deadlocked

Russia Refuses to Recognize Spanish Warring Faction; France Accepts British Compromise

[London] After the Italian Ambassador to the UK, Grandi, had a 12-minute talk with British Prime Minister Chamberlain yesterday afternoon, the Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, went to the British Foreign Office today to discuss the UK's new non-intervention monitoring plan for about an hour. It was learned that Maisky did not change his opinion when he spent time at the last non-intervention committee meeting. In any case, the Soviet government should not recognize the Spanish Nationalist Army as a warring faction. (Central News Agency, 28th, London Electric)

[Paris] Regarding the compromise plan proposed by the British government on the Spanish civil war non-intervention measures, it was recently accepted by France. The French Foreign Ministry is currently drafting a note and is scheduled to send it to Spain this afternoon. (Central News Agency, 28th, Havas Electric)

[London] After the subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee decided yesterday to abandon the British-proposed question list, diplomatic circles were quite pessimistic about the future. The only result of the future work of the Adjustment Committee is only to maintain a "talking club." Diplomatic circles also said, "Although the Chairman of the Adjustment Committee, Sir Plymouth, the British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, sent letters to the governments of the relevant countries, asking them to submit their opinions on the British compromise plan separately, it is expected that the responses of the relevant countries will follow the usual practice of making clever arguments, while maintaining the original reservation conditions for the two issues of withdrawing volunteer soldiers and recognizing both parties involved in the Spanish civil war as warring factions. In addition, it seems that no country is willing to bear the financial responsibility for the final breakdown of the negotiations. Therefore, it may be possible to establish a subcommittee to study the solution. However, this subcommittee will be close to empty talk, and its nature is actually equal to a "talking club." It is also heard that within the British cabinet, opinions are not consistent on the British attitude after the breakdown of the non-intervention measures. Some cabinet members believe that the UK should declare neutrality and prohibit arms from being transported to both sides of the Spanish civil war, but other cabinet members believe that trade with Spain should be fully restored. Observers generally believe that the UK is determined to delay the time until one party involved in the Spanish civil war has actually won, and then make a final decision. The Labor Party is deeply afraid that the government will recognize the Spanish Nationalist Army government during the parliamentary recess, so today the party's National Executive Committee passed a resolution to warn the people of the whole country. (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas Electric)

[London] The "Daily Express" reported that after the British Prime Minister Chamberlain and the Italian Ambassador Grandi met, there will be significant progress in British-Italian relations. The newspaper also said that the talk lasted for one and a half hours, breaking the record of long talks between the American Prime Minister and foreign envoys. However, the "Times" reported that the talk focused on the European situation, and especially emphasized the British-Italian relations, but it was purely an exchange of opinions.

[Washington] President Roosevelt recently summoned Admiral Leahy, Chief of Naval Operations, to discuss the replenishment of reserve officers during wartime. It is heard that the President will take various measures to increase the number of reservists (the existing number of reservists is still less than 150,000). (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 27th)

[Washington] Bowen, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance and Design of the Navy Department, told the Associated Press today that the chromite production in the Philippines is very developed and it is expected that this mineral resource will be an important item in U.S.-Philippine trade after the island's independence.

The Emperor appeals to the world to stop the Italian army's atrocities

[London] Emperor Selassie of Abyssinia has issued an appeal to Christian churches around the world, calling for an end to the Italian people's "mistreatment" of Abyssinian compatriots. He stated that Italian troops routinely massacre hundreds of Abyssinian women and children, and prisoners are burned to death. Italian soldiers also abduct and rape women. "I am issuing this appeal in the firm belief that church leaders around the world will be able to exert moral pressure to prevent the Italian army from going too far against our people and to stop all kinds of atrocities."

Chairman Kumagai of the Budget Committee reported on the process and results. Without any questions, it was immediately approved. The government then proposed a bill to issue bonds to fund the North China Incident. Finance Minister Kaya explained the reasons for the proposal, which was approved. (Domei News Agency, 28th)

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee convened at 10:20 this morning to deliberate on the expenses for the North China Incident. Finance Minister Kaya first explained the budget for the North China Incident. Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai also explained the details of the required expenses. Subsequently, Prime Minister Konoe spoke, saying, "In my opinion, we have reached a time when we should make a major decision. I hope that you will agree to this supplementary budget with this in mind." (Domei News Agency, 28th)

[Tokyo] Japanese Finance Minister Kaya recently presented two proposals at a special session of the Diet. One was to re-evaluate the gold reserves of the Bank of Japan, reducing it from 750 sen per yen to 290 sen, which is expected to generate a profit of 800 million yen. The other was to establish an exchange adjustment fund. At the same time, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has also completed a five-year plan to increase national gold production, stating that by 1942, it can be increased from the current 50 tons to 135 tons.

### British King and Queen tour Northern Ireland

Riots break out on the Southern Ireland border

Belfast: The King and Queen of England arrived here yesterday. Southern Ireland Free State people suddenly caused several incidents in the border area. Telephone lines around Dundalk have been cut. Four people were arrested in Omagh, all possessing pistols and rifles but refusing to explain the reason. Hundreds of Southern Ireland soldiers are patrolling the Free State border area. Cars traveling from the Southern Ireland capital to the Northern Ireland border are being checked. The special team of the Southern Ireland capital police department has been ordered to mobilize, and most of them have been sent to work on the border. No incidents have occurred in this city. When the King and Queen arrived, the citizens warmly welcomed them. (Havas Dispatch, 28th)

Belfast: Riots continued today between Southern Ireland and Ulster. Customs sheds were burned and sections of railway bridges were blown up. The police are unable to suppress them. Riots have also occurred elsewhere. The intention of these riots, which coincide with the King and Queen's imminent visit to Belfast, is probably to prevent tourists from going to that place. Five suspected rioters have been arrested and will be prosecuted on August 4 for disturbing public order. Other conspiracies have also been discovered. However, the people of Northern Ireland are making intense preparations to prevent disturbances. All vehicles going to the border are subject to inspection.

### Right of asylum for political prisoners

Argentina has drafted a plan and is notifying governments of all countries separately

Buenos Aires, Argentina: Foreign Minister Lamas recently sent a draft plan for universalizing political prisoner asylum to the ambassadors of various countries to Argentina, asking them to forward it to their respective governments. The plan argues that anyone who has not committed ordinary crimes but is prosecuted for political motives should have the right to asylum in foreign embassies, public consulates, naval warships, and military aircraft. Political prisoners who receive asylum can leave the country and reside in other countries, but the country providing asylum should be responsible for preventing them from engaging in any actions that could disrupt public order.

### Recent situation in Tongzhou

Japanese troops stationed in Tongzhou number 2,000, forcing laborers to build defenses, businesses everywhere refuse to use counterfeit currency

Tongzhou Correspondence: Tongzhou is the seat of the puppet government of Eastern Hebei and an area where the Japanese army stations heavy troops. The recent situation is something that the people of our country want to know, so I will briefly record it below.

Investigation of Japanese military strength

Approximately one thousand Japanese troops are stationed in Tongzhou, led by two regimental commanders, Yamagaya and Suzuki. 500 Japanese troops are stationed in the Tongxian Normal School in the city, 100 artillery troops are stationed in the Tongxian Women's Normal School science museum and the school's student dormitories, and 300 cavalry troops are stationed there. There are eight artillery pieces, one tank, and eighteen trucks. In the south of the city, in the villages of Bocun (village name), Zhangjiawan, Xiaojie, Shangmatou, Zhuan Factory, and Mazhuang, and in the west of the city, in the villages of Zhucheng, Chongyu Temple, Hongguoyuan, Huangguoyuan, Li Laogongzhuang Mibidian, and in the northwest of the city, in the villages of Wuxingqiao and Dengjiayao, etc. (the above is the first line of defense) (A total of 1,000 infantry and cavalry troops are stationed there. Almost all of the villagers' houses have been occupied by the Japanese army. Women, children, and strong men have all fled. Only a few old and weak people remain. Moreover, the positions where the Japanese army is stationed are all behind the security team. (At the same time, the Security Training Corps and the Security First Corps are stationed in each village, totaling 4,500 people.) Because the Japanese army has learned that the security team is not sincerely supporting the puppet government, but is simply going through the motions out of fear of the Japanese army's power, it is taking a strict monitoring attitude to prevent them. The Japanese army's rations and fodder are all taken from the local area, and requisitions are extremely frequent. Moreover, the green crops outside each village have been trampled or cut down by the Japanese army to feed horses, and the people have suffered great losses. Also, the puppet security Third and Fourth Corps, originally stationed in Qinhuangdao, Linyu, Funing, and other places, led by Li Haitian and Han Zexin, have been ordered to move west. Their vanguard infantry has arrived in Tongzhou city and is temporarily stationed in various hotels. The defense of Qinhuangdao has been completely taken over by a regiment of Japanese soldiers. It is heard that the two corps are preparing to go to the front lines, but no puppet Manchukuo troops have arrived in the territory yet.

Forcible conscription of laborers and vehicles

The Japanese army has established two lines of defense fortifications in Tongzhou, but they have not yet been completed, so laborers are still being forced to speed up construction. The puppet government has also secretly built a wooden bridge at the Shaizizhuang ferry crossing on the Tonghui River outside the west gate of the county seat for communication with the front lines and for transporting military supplies. Yesterday, the Japanese army ordered the puppet government to conscript another 1,000 laborers and 200 large carts. Counting the laborers previously conscripted, there are a total of 3,500 laborers and 430 large carts. The Japanese army also plans to select 500 strong men from the recently conscripted laborers and drive them to the front lines to transport ammunition and supplies. All laborers and vehicles are apportioned by the Tongxian County Government, acting on the orders of the puppet government, to the local villages. The county is responsible for 300 vehicles, with an average of one and a half large carts per village, and must hire twelve laborers. Each large cart and livestock requires 400 yuan in national currency, and the 12 laborers each require approximately 30-40 yuan in hiring fees. To date, each village's burden has reached 700-800 yuan. The people are complaining endlessly because of the poor harvest last year and the extremely difficult rural economy. However, they dare not resist out of fear of violence.

Counterfeit currency refused for redemption

The Jidong Bank, run by the Jidong Government, was established in Tongzhou on November 1 last year, with a branch in Tangshan. The total capital is said to be 5 million yuan. The puppet finance minister, Zhao Congzhao, serves as the general manager and issues 10-yuan, 5-yuan, 1-yuan, and 5-jiao banknotes, as well as 1-jiao white copper coins, 5-fen nickel coins, and 1-fen and 5-li bronze coins (all manufactured in Japan). It is also planned to issue 100-yuan and 1-jiao banknotes in the future. This puppet bank does not redeem any of these currencies. If you want to spend it in Beijing or Tianjin, you must first have the bank remit the money to the local Korean Bank, and then collect the legal tender from the Korean Bank with a ticket. This counterfeit currency is of extremely poor quality and cannot be redeemed in the counties of eastern Hebei, so it is called hell money. As a result, since its issuance, businesses everywhere in eastern Hebei have been unwilling to accept it. However, for fear of being accused of disrupting the financial order, they have all raised prices to resist it. Recently, since the Japanese army's attack on the Lugouqiao Bridge, the bank's general manager, Zhao Congzhao, and managers Jiang Hua and Zhang Zhiyuan, have secretly resided in Beijing and have refused to go to the bank to work. The bank has refused to remit money because no one is in charge. Businesses everywhere have heard the news and have uniformly refused to use the puppet bank's currency for more than ten days. The puppet government still has no remedial measures. It is estimated that the soft and hard currency issued by the puppet bank amounts to more than 600,000 yuan. Now that it cannot be redeemed, many businesses in Tongxian alone have gone bankrupt as a result. (Morning of the 16th)

### Guangdong People's Movement to Resist Aggression and Save the Nation

Trade unions establish salvation work groups and resolve to refuse to load and unload enemy goods

Guangzhou Correspondence: The resumption of the war in Hebei has greatly excited the people here. Various groups have risen up to spontaneously organize resistance and salvation work groups to prepare to assist in resisting the enemy and to thoroughly refuse to transport private goods of the enemy into the interior. In addition to the cities, counties will set up smuggling inspection committees to mobilize together to inspect for smuggling. Cotton yarn merchants and general merchandise merchants have been notified by their trade associations to stop handling enemy goods from today. The Guangzhou Newspaper Association has also resolved to unanimously stop publishing advertisements for enemy stores to show its determination to resist the enemy. Those who usually deposit money in a certain country's bank on Shameen are also withdrawing it one after another. Various trade unions in the area, such as the Guangzhou General Machinery Workers' Union and the Seamen's Union, have established salvation work groups, with 100 members formed into one group, and each group divided into several teams. Their mission is to promote salvation work, and their task is to prepare to maintain transportation in times of emergency. The Minchuan Trade Union has organized an investigation team to assist in investigating smuggling. The civil ferry department of the association has resolved to refuse to load and unload enemy goods in the future. Therefore, the enemy felt that transporting private goods deep into the interior was not as free as in Japan. The Japanese Consul in Guangdong, Nakamura Toyoichi, went to the provincial government on the morning of the 25th to see Ouyang Ju, the secretary-general of the provincial government, claiming that the dockworkers' refusal to load and unload goods was being directed by personnel who maintained autonomy, and asked the provincial government to stop it. Ouyang replied that the dockworkers' righteous actions were purely spontaneous, and the personnel maintaining public order could not direct them, nor could they stop them. Nakamura did not get what he wanted. On the 26th, he visited Diao Zuoyi, Special Envoy of Foreign Affairs for Liangguang, asking him to stop the civil ferry trade union's refusal to load and unload Japanese ship goods. Diao said that the workers' actions were a response to the Japanese military's aggression and were purely the people's sincere blood. The government could not stop them. The Japanese consul then silently withdrew. (July 27)

### Songjiang

The people cheer for the recapture of Fengtai

Wang Qintao, the head of the fourth district of this county, was previously accused by the heads of towns and villages in the district in a joint petition to the provincial authorities and the Supervisory Envoy's Office of engaging in corruption and irregularities, and five charges were listed, requesting a thorough investigation. The special commissioner's office sent personnel to investigate and the matter has been silent for a long time. Now, it is heard that the county government received an order from the province a few days ago to remove the district chief and appoint a suitable person to take over.

### Kunshan

Gu Changgan, Jiang Desheng, and Xu Changkang, young people from this county, considering the seriousness of the national crisis, intend to instill patriotic ideas in the public and organize a salvation drama troupe for publicity purposes.

First, the houses obstructing the work along the street will be completely demolished within one month. All roadwork in this section will be completed within the year. The project has been selected for continued contracting by the Tai Kee Construction Company.

### Changzhou

Police station seizes large quantities of drugs

Song Ruhang, police chief of the Boai Road police station of the Wuyi County urban police station, led the police to check the railway station at 3:00 AM on the 27th. When the Shanghai-Nanjing express train arrived at the station, they noticed that a man and a girl looked distraught, and immediately followed them and searched them. They found a large bag of heroin on the girl's side and another large bag of white powder. Police Chief Zhu immediately took the man and girl back to the police station and reported it to the urban police station for interrogation. The man confessed his name was Zhu Yueqi, from Shandong, living in Shanghai. The girl's name was Yun Yatou, 15 years old, living at the bottom of Tianhuangtang Lane. He then sent police to search Yun's residence. Yun Chunyin, a man, was ill in bed, and another large bag of drugs was found next to Yun's wife. Five medium-sized bags and nine small bags of drugs were also found on the bed and taken to the police station together and transferred to the main bureau for investigation.

### Yangzhou

Squadron Commander executed for communicating with bandits

Zhang Qingan, the squadron commander of the Detective Squad of the Jiangdu Police Bureau, was reported for communicating with bandits and harboring transporters of soil. The county detained him and removed him from his position before New Year's Eve of last year. After verifying that he was privately addicted to opium and had been through rehabilitation, it was confirmed through interrogation that he had indeed communicated with bandits and transported soil. The case was reported to the provincial government and then to the Military Affairs Commission, which approved the death penalty. At approximately 4:00 AM on the 27th, he was taken to court to verify his identity, tied up, and taken to the execution ground in front of the vagrant reformatory. The execution was supervised by Lv Dajun, director of the Third Section.

### Nantong

Foreign warships on the Yangtze River near Langshan

Recently, two foreign warships have arrived on the Yangtze River near Langshan from Shanghai one after another. Because they are in deep water, the flags are not clear. At night, searchlights are used to illuminate the shore. The local authorities have specially dispatched detectives to inspect the port.

Anti-Enemy Support Association established

In view of the urgency of the situation in North China, people from all walks of life in Tongyi formed the Anti-Enemy Support Association on the 27th and sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang and Song Zheyuan, expressing popular sentiment and vowing to provide support.

### Jiashan

Traitors emerge endlessly

The military and police in Jiashan County jointly carry out inspections, but traitors continue to emerge. They disguise themselves as hawkers, candy vendors, or Jin Tan sellers. Their cunning tricks are endless. Yesterday, a suspected traitor who was disguised as a glass cup seller was apprehended in the city. An empty box of opium was found in his possession, with a small character written in each of the four corners on the back, which was quite puzzling. After repeated questioning, he replied that it was a cloth factory mark, but his words were vague. He was immediately sent to the county for interrogation. In addition, Chen Chuxiang, a suspected traitor, was apprehended by Wang Qingyun, an investigative policeman of the Public Security Bureau, along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway track in Dongji, Fengjing. He was about 20 years old. A business card from Chen Xungui of the East Asia Company was found on his person. He has been temporarily taken to the bureau for investigation.

### Ningbo

Yin Feng Company earns profits

Due to the improved market conditions and the sharp increase in passengers this year, the Yin Feng Long-Distance Bus Company's business is booming. Furthermore, after adding diesel buses, the consumption of oil has been greatly reduced, so the business settlement for the first half of this year shows a surplus of tens of thousands of yuan.

### Yuyao

Strictly prohibit private slaughter of draft cattle

In the villages around the Yushanshi area of Yuyao, farm draft cattle are often stolen and slaughtered privately by general thugs, so there are meat stalls everywhere in the market. The county government believes that draft cattle are the second life of farm families and that the private slaughter of draft cattle is not permitted by life itself. It has ordered the Hushan District to strictly investigate and prohibit this.

Some were so enthusiastic that they even danced and shouted slogans. The upliftment of people's spirits was unparalleled, and it also demonstrated the progress of the people's concern for national affairs, truly a good sign for the future of the country and the nation.

Strung Firecrackers and Cheers of Celebration

The news, disseminated through reports and radio broadcasts, spread throughout the city within half an hour. The sound of firecrackers went from sporadic to a dense string. All the city's government offices, companies, shops, residences, and even shantytowns, hung national flags amidst the sound of countless firecrackers. Instantly, thousands of flags fluttered, and cheers resounded like thunder, a scene that lasted for three hours without ceasing, truly unprecedented.

Lively Areas, Various Scenes

Nanjing Road, Fuzhou Road, Yu Qiaqing Road, and Edward Road in the Public Concession; Avenue Edward VII, Baxianqiao, and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession; and the 16 Shoupus, Xiaodongmen, Laoximen, Minguo Road, and Zhonghua Road in the Nanshi area were the liveliest, with the most firecrackers and the largest crowds gathered in celebration. A reporter patrolled these areas starting at 1 p.m., and those celebrating held small national flags, shouted slogans, and rode bicycles in groups through the crowds on the roads. Others wrote large characters on white cloth proclaiming the capture of Fengtai and Langfang and attached them to cars, speeding around to spread the word. Especially at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, the crowds gathered and did not disperse. When the Sincere and Wing On companies set off long strings of firecrackers, the cheers were deafening, and white towels and straw hats flew in the air, their emotions of excitement beyond description. Moreover, many Westerners mingled in the crowds, cheering and clapping along with the people, expressing sympathy for the Chinese people's struggle.

Various Organizations Wire Condolences to Song

The General Association of Chinese Marine Engineers of Pingjin telegraphed Song Zheyuan, commander of the 29th Army, to express condolences, saying: "Commander Song of Beiping and all officers and soldiers, upon receiving the joyous news, the whole country is ecstatic. We hope that you will take advantage of the victory to annihilate the enemy and recover lost territory. The future of the nation and the people depends on you. A special telegram of condolence, the General Association of Chinese Marine Engineers."

Immediately took the express train to Beijing

Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan was ordered to go to England as the deputy envoy to attend the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor and conveniently visited various European countries to inspect the navy. Due to the deteriorating situation between China and Japan and the imminent start of a full-scale war, he took a Eurasian flight from England a few days ago to Hong Kong and transferred to China National Aviation Corporation's Zhejiang aircraft yesterday morning to come to Shanghai, arriving here at Longhua Airport at around 3 p.m. Those who went to welcome him included Ma Deji, director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, Lin Yuequan, director of the Ordnance Department of the Navy, and Huang Xihong, a staff officer of the First Fleet. After Chen got off the plane, he went directly to the North Station and took the 4 o'clock express train back to Beijing to serve the country.

### Shanghai Youth Group Forms Wartime Service Corps

Since the July 7th North China Incident, members of the Shanghai Youth United National Salvation Alliance affiliated with major secondary schools have been working hard to raise funds and give speeches. Now, with the outbreak of the war in North China, they are widely soliciting students from various schools to form a wartime service corps, planning to divide into groups for rescue, relief, protection, propaganda, reconnaissance, transportation, and technical defense, to engage in work. A members' meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow (30th) at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss everything. It is heard that preparations for various procedures are extremely busy, and students from various schools are actively participating, extremely indignant, vowing to perish with the tyrannical Japanese.

### Municipal Police Bureau Issued a Statement Yesterday Urging Citizens to Remain Calm

A spokesman for the Municipal Police Bureau issued a statement saying: "Since the North China Incident, the whole country has been saddened and indignant. Although important villages, towns, and stations near our Pingjin have been repeatedly occupied by invaders, we have still exercised restraint in seeking peace. Our nation's painstaking efforts to love peace are also recognized by the world. However, peace also has its minimum limit. Beyond this limit, the lives of the nation and the people are at stake, and we cannot but resort to self-defense. Therefore, our army's recapture of Fengtai, Langfang, and other places yesterday was nothing more than a necessary measure taken based on self-defense. It is natural for the citizens of this city to be elated and even set off firecrackers to express their celebration after receiving this news in addition to their grief and indignation, which is excusable. However, our complete territory is vast and the future is long, and the responsibility is also extremely heavy. The recapture of one or two occupied sections should encourage us to work hard, respond calmly, save all material resources, time, and money, and collectively move towards the path of recovering our territory and revitalizing our nation. This is the right way to do it. Moreover, local order is important, and evil people may take the opportunity to cause trouble. Gatherings and parades like yesterday, setting off firecrackers, etc., can easily be exploited by evil people at any time and place, causing incidents and disrupting order. It is hoped that the citizens of this city will accumulate strength, maintain calmness, and respond to the situation. Do not cause trouble, do not be afraid of trouble, respond calmly, and work together to survive. This will definitely enable us to overcome the current difficulties and achieve the goal of self-reliance. However, there is no need to be afraid. In recent days, in the Zhabei area, there have been occasional cases of citizens relocating, and we should observe each other and stop this. The general principle is not to cause trouble, not to be afraid of trouble, to respond calmly, and to work together for survival, which will surely enable us to overcome the current difficulties and achieve the goal of self-reliance."

### Citizens Enthusiastically Donate to Resist the Enemy

Since its establishment, the Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association has begun to work the day before yesterday. Citizens have come to the association voluntarily and generously to donate funds with great enthusiasm. With such patriotism and donations, vying to be the first, where the people's spirit lies, the humiliation can be expected to be wiped away. Yesterday's donations were very large. The Shanghai Paper Industry Association held a temporary meeting yesterday (28th) to discuss (1) the case of organizing the Shanghai Paper Industry Anti-Enemy Support Association. The executive and supervisory committee members decided to be permanent fundraising committee members, and it was planned to raise 100,000 yuan first. It was passed that Mr. Zhan Peilin, the owner of Yiji Paper Shop, would pledge 5,000 yuan first.

Jin Long, a fifth-grade student at the Municipal Shuji Primary School (10 years old), saw that the soldiers on the front lines needed gas masks, so he personally sent 20 yuan, which his parents had given him to make new clothes, to the Anti-Enemy Support Association of All Circles in Tianhou Palace yesterday to buy them on his behalf.

At the same time, a declaration was issued and the work outline was passed. The full text is recorded below:

Fundraising Declaration

The sacred war to defend the Chinese nation has opened its prelude in the ancient capital. The central authorities have declared their determination, and the soldiers of the whole country are bravely sacrificing their lives. Today, there is either an enemy or us, or us without the enemy. The ancestral tombs of 5,000 years and the fate of hundreds of millions of descendants will all determine their honor and disgrace at this final moment. If we are not willing to be slaves, not willing to be cattle and horses, not willing to be whipped forever, and not willing to be slaughtered for a long time, then at this critical moment, we should have the spirit of destroying our families to relieve the difficulties of the country, donate funds to save the country, and save the country and save ourselves. Modern warfare, in addition to spiritual conditions, must also have material conditions before it can last and then be decisive. The prelude has been opened, and the resistance to the war will continue to the end. The enemy will not leave for a day, and the resistance to the war will not stop for a day. If the resistance to the war does not stop for a day, the donations will not stop for a day. All my compatriots, fathers and brothers, save money and food, and do their best to jointly save the nation. The spirit of the Yellow Emperor in heaven will surely rely on it.

Work Outline

The work outline of the Fundraising Committee of the Anti-Enemy Support Association: (1) The purpose of this association is to raise donations to contribute to the country and prepare for the needs of resisting the enemy and saving the country. (2) The aforementioned donations are named national salvation donations. (3) This association entrusts banks, money shops, and other collection agencies to receive donations.

### Japanese Groups in Shanghai Meet to Rescue Japanese Nationals Evacuating to Shanghai

The Actions of Japanese Nationals After January 28th; When the General Situation Is Urgent, Send Women and Children Back Home

The "China Press" reported that on Sunday, Japanese government and civilian groups in Shanghai held a meeting and decided to form an emergency committee to respond to the development of this port due to the North China Incident. This was the first action taken by Japanese nationals after the January 28th Shanghai Incident. At 4:30 p.m. on Sunday, the committee held its first meeting at the Japanese Club. Consul General Okamoto was elected as the chairman. Participants in the meeting included the Japanese Consulate General, the Special Naval Landing Forces Officer's Office, the Japanese Residents Association, the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and the Joint Association of Japanese Cotton Mills in China. The purpose was to rescue Japanese nationals who had evacuated from the interior of China to Shanghai. If the general situation was urgent, Japanese women and children in this port would be sent back to Japan.

### Li Guang'an's Information Needs Rescue Work

Song Zheyuan Personally Commands on the Front Lines; A Large Battle Is Underway, Emergency Need for Rescue Supplies

Li Guang'an, director of the 29th Army's office in Shanghai, received a phone call from the army's staff office in Beiping last night, reporting on the military situation: (1) Our army recaptured Fengtai at 8:40 a.m. this morning. All Japanese troops are retreating southwest. In this battle, two enemy planes were shot down and seven enemy planes and three tanks were captured, as well as countless other spoils of war. (2) Langfang and Tongxian have also been recaptured by our army one after another. The Japanese army is unable to resist and is collapsing. Our army is taking advantage of the victory to pursue. (3) After our army blew up the Yangcun Railway Bridge, the enemy had no way to return. When retreating to 𣓾 Village to cross the river, many drowned. The situation was extremely embarrassing. (4) After our army issued the general offensive order, Commander Song personally commanded on the front lines, and morale was extremely high. In an interview with reporters, Li said that in the past few days, Commander Song, and Liu Rifang have been seeking peace, but the Japanese side has no sincerity at all. On the one hand, they sing praises of peace, and on the other hand, they take active action, even issuing an ultimatum, limiting our army to withdraw from the national territory in order to achieve their conspiracy of encroachment. Our army could not bear it any longer and had to come out to fight. Since Commander Song issued a circular the night before, he has personally gone to the front lines to command the army and recapture Fengtai and other places. His past spirit of forbearance for the sake of the country can be made clear to the world. However, what should be urgently brought to the attention of people from all walks of life across the country is that after a large battle begins, the front lines need a lot of rescue supplies. It is easier to buy these supplies in Shanghai. It is hoped that all circles in Shanghai can quickly raise and prepare them and send them to the front lines for use. As for the donations raised by all parties for our army in the past, Commander Song said at the time that because it was a local resistance war, he did not dare to accept the monetary condolences from all parties. However, the current situation is different, and the special situation has already expanded. If rescue work is carried out and wounded soldiers' hospitals are established, funds are needed everywhere. It is hoped that all circles will provide assistance.

### Mayor Yu Issues Address to the Citizens

Maintain a Calm and Composed Spirit to Cope with Events; Cherish Spiritual and Material Resources as Essential Elements for Revival

Yesterday, Mayor Yu issued the following address to the citizens: "Recently, the situation in Peiping and Tientsin has become exceptionally tense. Adding to this, the disappearance of Japanese sailors and the armed alert of the Marines, who have intruded into the urban areas, has caused the people of Shanghai to readily believe various rumors. For days, people have been moving about incessantly, unable to find peace. Today, with the victory at Fengtai, people celebrated with firecrackers, almost beside themselves with joy. These expressions of public sentiment, alternating between alarm and delight, are all commonplace in such circumstances and not at all surprising. However, I, Hongjun, feel compelled to sincerely address my beloved citizens. At this time of grave national crisis, when the life and death of the entire nation are at stake, all of us citizens should maintain a calm and composed spirit to cope with all events. Our minds should be cool, and our measures should be prudent. Do not fear trouble, but do not create it. In our thoughts, consider the safety and security of the overall situation. In our plans, consider the interests of the entire nation. Do not be shortsighted and neglect long-term considerations. Do not spoil great plans for minor impatience. Know that if the country perishes, nothing can be spared. It is better to adopt a detached perspective, find peace of mind, make appropriate preparations, and ensure that our steps are not chaotic. This is the first point. China's weakness has accumulated over time, and its revival cannot happen overnight. Therefore, we must not become arrogant due to temporary victories. We must grit our teeth, set our goals, and be compassionate and resolute. Our spiritual and material resources are essential elements for revival and should be cherished, not wasted. For example, the firecrackers set off by thousands of families today, while expressing the sincere feelings of the people, would be better spent on practical undertakings. Rather than venting emotions here, it would be better to alleviate the wounds of the soldiers at the front. Written messages of慰勞 are not as effective as providing material assistance and relief. This is something my citizens should consider after celebrating the victory. This is the second point. In summary, our country, under the guidance of the central government and wise leaders, is following a fixed course towards national salvation. All our compatriots should unify their wills and coordinate their actions. Our great Chinese nation will eventually have a day to hold its head high."

### Director Pan Gongzhan's Message to Compatriots Regarding the Victory

War is by No Means a Matter of a Single Day or Night; Do Not Become Excessively Excited by a Temporary Victory

Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, issued a message to compatriots regarding the recovery of Fengtai and Langfang. The original text is as follows: "This morning, our troops recovered Fengtai and Langfang. Citizens rejoiced upon hearing the news, some setting off firecrackers. I cannot help but feel both joy and concern. It must be understood that this war, triggered by the Lugouqiao Incident, is, on our part, entirely a forced and unavoidable response. It is a desperate war to defend the survival of our nation and people. It is what military strategists call a 'war of sorrow.' Therefore, if we do not fight, we should not. But if we fight, we must exhaust our sorrow to seek ultimate victory. As such, war is by no means a local affair, nor is it a matter of a single day or night. Spatially, we must gather the strength of the entire nation to defend the territory of the whole country. Temporally, we must unite the spirit of the entire nation to endure the longest possible period. Moreover, all major wars, past and present, Chinese and foreign, must have a final decisive battle to determine victory or defeat. Before reaching the main decisive battle, the advance and retreat of troops, and the attack and defense of battlefields, are entirely commonplace in military strategy. We should all heed the commander's directives. Our entire nation should clearly understand this meaning. Today, we must not become excessively excited by a temporary victory or the gain of a single place, leading to arrogance. Nor should we become overly despondent by a temporary defeat or the loss of a single place, leading to cowardice. Mencius said, 'Hold on to your will, do not be violent in your spirit.' This is indeed the most valuable lesson for our entire nation to strive for ultimate victory. I urge all my beloved compatriots across the country to unite their spirits, support the government, avoid arrogance, avoid complacency, avoid timidity, and avoid despondency from now on. Victory will surely be in our grasp."

### Health Campaign Held Closing Ceremony Yesterday

Previously, the Municipal Bureau of Health, in order to arouse citizens' deep attention to health and to instill various kinds of health knowledge, specially organized a summer health campaign to maintain social peace and tranquility. It is now known that in recent days, citizens from all walks of life have been actively going to get vaccinations, which is very enthusiastic. It can be seen that the general level of citizens has gradually improved, and they have a thorough understanding of health. Therefore, the harvest of the health campaign is also very significant. The campaign was scheduled to be closed by Li Ting'an, Director of the Bureau of Health, at the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road at 6 pm yesterday. At the same time, the health exhibition in the hall was also declared closed.

### Congratulations from Chinese and Foreign Parties on Mayor Yu's Inauguration

Mr. Yu Hongjun, Acting Mayor of this city, has been officially appointed to the position. He was immediately sworn in yesterday morning and started performing his duties as usual, without holding any ceremonies. Leaders from all walks of life in this city and diplomatic personnel from various countries' embassies and consulates went to the City Hall to offer their congratulations. According to Mr. Yu's statement to the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter yesterday morning, the position of Secretary-General of the Municipal Government will also be officially filled by Mr. Zhou Yongneng, the Acting Secretary-General. All other personnel below the rank of Section Chief will remain as before, without any major changes, in order to ensure familiarity with the work. It is reported that Mr. Yu is 41 years old, from Xinhui, Guangdong, and graduated from St. John's University in this city. He studied in the United States and initially served as Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Wuhan Government. He then joined the Shanghai Municipal Government, serving as Chief Counselor and Acting Director of the Finance Bureau. In 1920, he was promoted to Secretary-General. Mr. Yu is decisive in handling matters and has excellent relations with both Chinese and foreign parties. He is particularly skilled in diplomacy and has achieved satisfactory results in various negotiations in this city. Since the former Mayor Wu Tiecheng was transferred to Guangdong Province, Mr. Yu was appointed Acting Mayor on April 1st and has served until now. The central government's decision to officially appoint Mr. Yu has been welcomed by all parties.

### Miyasaki Found in Bajie Port, Jingjiang

According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on the 28th, the disappearance of Japanese sailor Miyasaki Sadao in Shanghai has been reported in Chinese and foreign newspapers. It is now learned that the sailor has been found in Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province. On the afternoon of the 28th of this month, he was escorted to Nanjing by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for transfer to the Japanese Consulate General in Nanjing. Thus, the mystery of the missing sailor in Shanghai has been solved. The circumstances are almost identical to the so-called "Tzangkamoto Incident" in June 1934. The details are as follows:

Recovered from the River

On the evening of the 24th of this month, the Japanese Marines in Shanghai suddenly claimed that a Japanese sailor was missing. Under the pretext of searching, they sent many soldiers to set up sentry posts in the Tiantong'an Yokohama Road area and searched pedestrians on the roads beyond the boundary, creating an unusually tense situation. On the 27th, a suspicious Japanese person was suddenly recovered from the river at Bajie Port, Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province. The county government sent him to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which transferred him to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 28th. The Japanese person identified himself as Miyasaki Sadao and personally narrated the circumstances of his actions. He stated that he had entered a brothel not designated by the Japanese Marines, which was discovered by a Japanese sailor, causing him to fear returning to his unit. He then boarded a British ship in an attempt to escape. On the 27th, he jumped into the river in Jingjiang County and was rescued, and so on. The sailor has now been sent by our side to the Japanese Consulate in Nanjing for verification.

Miyasaki's Own Account

The following is a translation of Miyasaki's handwritten record: "Miyasaki Sadao, First Class Seaman, Anti-Aircraft Company, Third Platoon, attached to the Command Headquarters Battalion, resident of 799 Xiangyuan Village, Kamo County, Hiroshima Prefecture, guardian Miyada Teisho. Due to going to a brothel other than that designated by the Japanese Marines, I was discovered by a certain sailor, causing me to fear returning to the unit. I proceeded towards the Shanghai Peace Pagoda. After passing the nights of the 24th and 25th, at around 8:00 AM on the 26th, I boarded a British ship. However, this action had no other purpose than to escape. At around 1:00 PM on the 26th, I jumped into the river near the Jingjiang County Police Station and arrived in Jingjiang County. I spent the night of the 26th in the mountains. At around 1:00 AM on the 27th, I jumped into the Yangtze River again. When I was about to reach the opposite bank of Jingjiang County, I was rescued by a certain ship and sent to the Jingjiang County Police Station. Since then, I have obeyed the orders of the police officers. The brothel is on Bazi Road. I went there alone at around 9:00 PM on the 24th. After paying 2 dollars, as I was about to return, I was pursued by three people resembling Chinese people who demanded money from me. There was a dispute, but I did not give them any money. I then took a rickshaw towards the Peace Pagoda. As I left the brothel, I was discovered by a sailor, but I do not know the sailor's name. The aforementioned dispute took place after I was discovered by the sailor. During the dispute, I was wearing my uniform. In the midst of the dispute, I discarded my cap badge and collar insignia and immediately left in a rickshaw. After passing the Peace Pagoda, I wrapped my uniform in newspaper and carried it with me on the ship. It was very painful when I jumped into the river because I discarded it. The reason for jumping into the river was that I had been sleeping on the top deck and was discovered by the crew, who said they would take me to the captain. Because I did not have a ticket, I felt terrified and jumped into the river. July 28, Showa 12. Miyasaki Sadao. (fingerprint)"

### International Settlement Volunteer Corps Mobilization Denied by Fessenden

There have been rumors in recent days that the Public Concession's Municipal Council has ordered the International Settlement Volunteer Corps to be on standby for immediate mobilization. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Council, yesterday to inquire. According to him, all the rumors are false. If necessary, an order for mobilization could be issued temporarily within a few hours. The International Settlement Volunteer Corps includes Chinese, British, Japanese, American, and White Russian teams. In the event of a Sino-Japanese conflict in Shanghai, only the British and American teams would be ordered to mobilize. The Chinese and Japanese teams would be excluded.

### Investigation of the Paint Guild's Embezzlement Case Reveals No Errors in Accounts

The Incident Arose from Misunderstandings Between the Parties; Request for a Verdict of Not Guilty; Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 31st

Representatives elected by the entire membership of the Shanghai West Paint Industry Guild filed a complaint against Le Zhenbao, Bei Runsheng, Zhang Lanping, Le Gengrong, and others, directors of the Shanghai Yanghuo Commercial Guild, now renamed the Renyi Shanhui (Benevolence and Righteousness Charity Association), alleging breach of trust and embezzlement of the guild's jointly owned property. The defendants also filed a counterclaim and submitted ten years' worth of account books to the court for verification by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. This case has been ongoing for a year. All the account books have been reviewed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and no flaws were found. The Chamber reported the situation to the court. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the court convened again to continue the hearing. The plaintiffs, accompanied by lawyer Chao Kun, arrived in court. The four defendants, accompanied by defense lawyers Lin Yingqing, Yan Yinwu, Wang Manyun, and Yuan Hanyun, also arrived in court. After the court questioned both parties, they stated that, after reviewing the accounts, the misunderstandings between the two sides had been clarified and resolved, and there were no errors in the accounts. The stone tablet in the association hall, which had been painted over, has now been cleaned, and so on. The court distributed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's reply to both parties' lawyers for review. As the case was already clear, the court ordered the start of closing arguments. On behalf of the plaintiffs, lawyer Chao Kun stated that the case arose from misunderstandings between the parties. It has now been verified that there are no errors in the accounts, and the defendants did not violate any laws. The misunderstandings between the two sides have been fully clarified. He requested that the court render a judgment in accordance with the law. The defense lawyers Lin Yingying and Yan Yinwu, among others, argued that the defendants did not act unlawfully to enrich themselves and therefore did not commit a crime. They requested that the defendants be acquitted. As a result, the court declared the closing arguments concluded and scheduled the sentencing for 9:00 AM on the 31st.

### Cholera Discovered in Haikou, Guangdong

Inspecting Ships Coming to Shanghai

Since the large-scale cholera epidemic in China in 1932, according to its cyclical pattern, there was a possibility of its reappearance last year. Fortunately, due to the effective epidemic prevention measures nationwide, the country was able to safely pass through it, which was truly fortunate. This year, it was generally believed that it would not occur, but unfortunately, the Seaport Quarantine Office has received a warning that cholera has been discovered in Haikou, Guangdong. The Seaport Quarantine Office has attached great importance to the above-mentioned warning. In addition to instructing the quarantine personnel to pay close attention, it has also telegraphed Haikou to report the details of the epidemic situation after its discovery. At the same time, the Hong Kong health authorities have declared Haikou a cholera-infected port. However, the direct traffic between Shanghai and Haikou is relatively light. Although there are occasional transport ships traveling between the two ports, they are not frequent. Moreover, the Seaport Quarantine Office has instructed the quarantine doctors to conduct thorough quarantine procedures on ships coming to Shanghai via Haikou before allowing them to enter the port. Therefore, Shanghai should not be invaded by it. At the same time, residents of this city should also voluntarily request cholera vaccinations and pay attention to summer hygiene to maintain their health and well-being.

### Barge Owner Sells Huge Amount of Cotton Yarn

Empty Boat Moored at China Merchants Bureau Wharf; County Offers Reward of 1,000 Yuan to Apprehend Barge Owner

On the morning of the 26th of this month, the China Cotton Industry Co., Ltd., located at No. 8 Gongguan Road (i.e., Avenue Edward VII) in the French Concession, hired barge No. 8608, owned by barge owner Wang Agen, to load 50 bales of 18-count Fugui brand cotton yarn from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank warehouse on the North Suzhou Creek and transport them to the Jiang'an steamer at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf in the French Concession Bund for shipment to Jiujiang. After loading was completed at 12:00 noon, the barge set off from the Suzhou Creek to the Outer Huangpu River and disappeared. Instead of delivering the goods to the Jiang'an steamer, the barge owner sold the goods midway. The empty boat was moored at the China Merchants Bureau China Wharf in Pudong. The company sent people to search everywhere, but they could not be found. After discovering the empty boat yesterday morning, it was learned that barge owner Wang Agen had abandoned the boat and fled. The company immediately filed a report with the French police and offered a reward for the apprehension of the barge owner. A reward of 1,000 yuan will be given to anyone who can recover both the person and the goods, and a reward of 200 yuan will be given to anyone who provides information that leads to the solving of the case. Yesterday, the French police issued a description of Wang Agen's appearance, age (approximately 30 years old), and origin (from Nantong) and requested the Public Concession police and the Municipal Police Bureau to assist in the apprehension.

### Chauffeur Sentenced to Ten Years for Manslaughter

Since the Ministry of Judicial Administration instructed all levels of courts to prosecute cases of automobile accidents causing death as intentional homicide in accordance with the Criminal Law to protect people's lives, courts in various places have been handling such cases with caution. Recently, Zhou Axiao, a driver of a certain automobile company, negligently crashed into and killed a worker of the Public Works Bureau who was building a road near Gujialong on Beijing Road. Subsequently, lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station prosecuted him for causing death through negligence in his profession (the maximum sentence for which is imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years). However, after trial by Judge Feng Shide, Zhou was found guilty of intentional homicide and was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment yesterday. This case is the first case handled by the Special First Court in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Justice.

### Wet Nurse's Negligence Suffocates Baby Girl

Court Has Verified; Wet Nurse Awaiting Trial

A woman named Yan Zhu, from Ningbo, residing at No. 4 Yuexiu Lane, Chunsheng Street, Jiangwan, due to the current situation, brought her newborn daughter, Jin Fang, aged five months and fifteen days, and her wet nurse, Wan Peng, a 23-year-old woman from Anhui, to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon to stay with her elder sister, Sun Zhu, at No. 10 Lane 410, Zhaofeng Road. In the evening, Jin Fang was breastfed and put to sleep by Wan Peng. At around 1:00 AM, Yan Zhu went to check on them and saw that the wet nurse and the girl were both sound asleep. She noticed that Jin Fang's face was pale and she could not be moved. Her skin was cold. Alarmed, she woke the wet nurse and immediately sent the girl to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The doctors diagnosed that the girl had died two hours ago. They reported it to the Huishan Police Station, which sent detectives to cordon off the scene and sent the infant corpse of Jin Fang to the Fei Lun autopsy room for examination. The wet nurse, Wan Peng, was taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Special First Court, where police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and filed a lawsuit against her for causing death by negligence (because the cause of the girl's death was no more than her body pressing on her mouth and nose, causing suffocation). Then, according to the victim Yan Zhu's proof of the course of events, questioned by the defendant, her confession was vague. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered that she be sent back to prison for further review. Tang, the prosecutor, arrived at the scene and found that the deceased girl, Yan Jinfang, had indeed died from suffocation while alive. The corpse was handed over to her mother, Yan Zhu, who signed a pledge to take care of the funeral.

### Patient Dies After Jumping from Building Due to Stress

Du Yisheng from Dujiaxing, Pudong, Fell to His Death at Guangci Hospital

Du Yisheng, 31 years old, from Dujiaxing, Pudong, went to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road at 8:00 AM on the 27th, claiming to have a stomach ailment and requesting to be admitted for treatment. After examination by the hospital doctors, he was admitted to an ordinary ward on the third floor for treatment. However, at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Du, for some unknown reason, suddenly jumped off the balcony outside the third-floor ward of the hospital, causing brain injuries and immediate death. The hospital nurses and attendants discovered the incident and reported it to the French police, who sent officers to investigate. The body was then taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for examination. Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Court, and a forensic doctor arrived at the scene and verified that the death was indeed caused by injuries sustained from the fall. As there was no way to locate the deceased's family, the authorities ordered the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to take care of the burial.

### Overseas Chinese Volunteers to Join Air Combat

It is reported that many children of overseas Chinese residing in Australia, the Philippines, and Hawaii who have studied aviation, upon hearing of the outbreak of war between China and Japan in North China, have telegraphed the 29th Army, expressing their willingness to return to China at their own expense with their own airplanes to join in the air combat.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Resolves to Repair the Public Hospital

In February of this year, the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council decided to form a subcommittee with the authority to consider the following two issues and report to the Council's Health Committee: ⑴ How to make the connection between the Public Hospital and the Hong'en Hospital closer; ⑵ Whether it is necessary to renovate the eastern buildings of the Public Hospital. After the subcommittee was established, it considered the above two items separately. The report was submitted by the committee at the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting this Wednesday. The Board of Directors resolved to proceed as planned. The subcommittee believes that the first issue does not need to be discussed in detail because the two hospitals are far apart, and the patients in the two hospitals do not belong to the same class. Therefore, it is not beneficial to have a closer connection between the two hospitals at present, but in the future, there may be room for mutual connection due to changes in the environment. Therefore, it is proposed to ask the directors of the two hospitals to hold joint meetings twice a year to consider whether there is a possibility of closer connection. Regarding the second issue, the subcommittee believes that the eastern part of the Public Hospital has been in disrepair for a long time, but it would cost too much to rebuild it, which is not suitable in the current situation in Shanghai. According to the reports of the hospital architect and the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department, if the north wall of the hospital is repaired with reinforced concrete, and the damaged wood, bricks, and tiles are replaced separately, the hospital buildings can still be used, and the cost will be minimal. Therefore, the subcommittee proposes to carry out repairs and add new sanitary facilities in the east, so as to avoid the trouble of demolition and construction. During the repair project, the patients in the eastern part of the hospital can be temporarily accommodated by Hong'en Hospital. This has been properly negotiated by the two hospitals.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Postpones Consideration of Opium License Issue in the Settlement

The Municipal Government previously submitted several plans to the Shanghai Municipal Council to register opium smokers in the settlement so that they could purchase and smoke opium with a license. For the sake of caution, the Municipal Council appointed Chinese Director Xi Yushu, Western Director McDonald, and Nai Berland to form a subcommittee to consider this issue. The committee is chaired by McDonald and is currently continuing to investigate the facts with the police department, such as accusations regarding opium offenders. The Board of Directors will discuss it again after the summer recess.

### Shao Yueru, Accused of Fraud, Found Not Guilty

Shao Yueru, a native of Shaoxing and a shareholder of the bankrupt Yang Qinghe Jiujii Silver House, was sued by creditors Guo Zhouzhu, Shi Yiji, Kang Yichu, and Kuai Shaozhao when the silver house went bankrupt, requesting the return of more than 110,000 yuan in deposits. As a result, a settlement was reached, with Shao paying a portion of the cash in advance, and the remaining more than 90,000 yuan was paid by check, but all of them could not be cashed when they were due. Guo and others then sued Shao for fraud to the police station. The police station recently arrested Shao, and the police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him in the Special First Court for fraud and damaging creditor's rights under Articles 339 and 356 of the Criminal Law. Shao also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. The Special Court has concluded the trial and is awaiting sentencing. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo of the Second Criminal Court announced the verdict, and Shao Yueru was found not guilty.

### Robbers in Ruihua Alley Sentenced to One and a Half Years

Ge Yunqing, a patrolman of the French Concession's Ruihua Alley on Lafayette Road and Beile Road, was attacked by rioters who attempted to rob his pistol on the afternoon of April 1 last year, and was seriously injured by wooden and iron rods. Ge still struggled to hold on to the two murderers, Pan Zhibao and Cao Zhiqing, and reported them to the court. They were sentenced to imprisonment. Pan and others confessed that they were instigated by Zhang Zifeng, also known as Cui Zifeng, the owner of the cigarette paper shop at the entrance of Ruihua Alley. The police station arrested him. It was not until the beginning of this month that Ge met Zhang on the road and handed him over to the patrolmen for investigation. The plaintiff filed a civil suit for damages of 58 yuan and 7 jiao. The case was repeatedly tried by Liao Pei, the chief of the Criminal Court. At 9 a.m. yesterday, Chief Judge Liao presided over the First Criminal Court and sentenced Zhang Zifeng to one year and six months for injuring the body and found him not guilty of robbery. The defendant should also compensate 58 yuan and 7 jiao in national currency.

### A Rice Shop Apprentice Fell to His Death While Unloading Rice From a Truck

Unstable Footing While the Truck Turned a Corner, Abandoned After the Fall

Cheng Yi Rice Shop at No. 89 Heng Street, Dama Road, Nanshi, ordered a truck to transport rice to the Wusong Rice Shop on the afternoon before yesterday. The driver of the truck was Ge Xingsheng, and the apprentice Li Guixing (28 years old, from Dongtai) and his companions stood behind the truck to unload the rice. When the truck arrived at Wusong, Li Guixing lost his footing at a corner and fell off the truck, breaking his head and bones. A group of apprentices and drivers ignored him and unloaded the rice first. Then, they took the injured person back with the truck. Unexpectedly, when the truck arrived at the gate, the person had already died. The Nanshi Branch was reported, and yesterday, the Sixteen Shop Chief was ordered to petition the court for examination.

The manager of the nightclub, Wu Guilin, intervened and drove them out, which angered the crowd and broke Wu's face. The police were called and the eight people were taken to the District Court. Prosecutor Chen released the defendants on bail and filed a public prosecution for injury. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Kangsun heard the case. Wu Guilin requested an incidental civil suit for 90 yuan. The defendants only admitted to grabbing and twisting, but did not admit to hitting. The judge mediated a settlement, first reprimanding the defendants for their violence, and then warning the plaintiff that merchants should also be peaceful. The defendants compensated the plaintiff 40 yuan, and the lawsuit was settled.

### Playing with a Handgun Injured a Servant's Leg

At 10:40 a.m. yesterday, Wen Jinchang, an employee of the Law Firm of Roger at 320 Sichuan Road, Anli Building, 3rd Floor, injured his servant, Chen Guangxun, a 16-year-old Shanghainese, while playing with a handgun. Lawyer Roger had a handgun for self-defense and often carried it with him. The day before yesterday, he forgot the handgun and hid it in the drawer of his desk. Yesterday, when Wen opened the drawer to take things out, he saw the handgun and took it out to play with it.

### Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency Sets Up a Temporary Information Center for Current Affairs

### Shanghai Witnesses Summoned in Hankou Counterfeit Coin Case

Those Summoned Include Social Bureau Staff, All Claiming Not to Be in Partnership With Liu Puqing

Last fall, Lu Fangzheng, a doctor from Xiangye, forged a letter of commission from the Hubei Provincial Bank and commissioned Liu Peiwei's Huadong Engraving Company at No. 25 Maoyili, Meibai Road, to print auxiliary coins for the Hubei Provincial Bank. Liu reported it to the police station, who ordered the investigators to arrest Lu and send him to the Special First Court for interrogation and sentencing. Subsequently, the Hubei Provincial Bank hired lawyer Sheng Peidong to file a complaint in the Special First Court against Liu Peiwei, the owner of the Huadong Engraving Company, alleging that he was jointly involved in counterfeiting auxiliary coins. When the court opened, Liu did not appear in court, resulting in the case being suspended. However, Liu Puqing, the brother of Liu Peiwei, was recently arrested and investigated by the Procuratorate of the District Court in Hankou for allegedly counterfeiting auxiliary coins of the Hubei Provincial Bank. Because Liu Puqing had raised shares in Shanghai to establish the Huadong Photogravure Printing Company, the Procuratorate of the Hankou District Court sent a letter to the First Special Court to entrust it with summoning the relevant witnesses in order to clarify the relationship between Liu's brothers. The witnesses summoned included lawyers Li Mo and Sheng Peidong, and key witness Rong Yueli, as well as Wu Langxi of the Cultural Life Publishing House, Tang Jinbai, an employee of the Municipal Social Bureau, and the clerk of lawyer Sheng Peidong, as well as Li Jingyu, who resided in the Wenzhou Hotel on Lafayette Road, a total of seven people. However, yesterday morning, only lawyer Li Mo, Wu Langxi, and Tang Jinbai appeared in court to testify. The remaining four people did not appear. According to lawyer Li Mo, I previously reported to the police station on behalf of Liu Peiwei, the owner of the Huadong Engraving Company, regarding the case of Lu Fangzheng counterfeiting auxiliary coins. I do not know where Liu is now. I also know Liu Puqing. He used to work at the San Yi Printing House. There are no shareholders of Liu Peiwei in the Huadong Photogravure Printing Company that is currently opened. According to Wu Langxi, I am one of the shareholders of the Huadong Photography Company, but there is no shareholder named Liu Peiwei among the shareholders. He then submitted the certificate documents of the shareholders of the Huadong Photogravure Printing Company to the court. According to Tang Jinbai, a supervisor of the Social Bureau, he is also one of the shareholders of the Huadong Photography Company and has no relationship with the Huadong Engraving Company, and there is no shareholder named Liu Peiwei. Judge Huang Risheng verified the testimony and ordered a change of date for summoning the remaining witnesses who had not arrived.

### Only the Determination to Sacrifice to the End Can Win the Final Victory

— Mu Chu

Mr. Song Zheyuan has a famous saying: 'Don't provoke trouble, don't be afraid of trouble.' The blame for the Lugou Bridge Incident is already known to the world. In other words, we did not 'provoke trouble.' Therefore, after being 'provoked,' we should continue with the promise of 'not being afraid of trouble.'

We really crave peace, but it is true peace, as Chairman Chiang said: "The Chinese nation has always been a peace-loving nation. The foreign policy of the National Government has always advocated seeking self-preservation internally and coexistence externally... In the past two years, diplomacy with Japan has been working hard in this direction, hoping to bring all kinds of disorderly states in the past into the right track of diplomacy to seek a proper solution." But let us look at the last ultimatum that Xiangyue proposed to Song, "The 37th Division near Lugou Bridge and Babaoshan must withdraw to Changxindian by noon on the 27th, and the 38th Division in Pingcheng must first withdraw to Yongding River by noon on the 28th, and then withdraw to Baoding." At the time, the Japanese government's statement, after describing the course of the incident, said: "In order to ensure the traffic line between Pingjin and to protect overseas Chinese from being harmed by the Chinese army, the Japanese army had to take necessary self-defense actions in order to carry out this task and ensure the implementation of the agreement. What Japan expects is to eradicate the root causes of such unfortunate incidents, not to be hostile to good people, nor to have any territorial ambitions. Japan will spare no effort to protect the rights and interests of various countries. Japan's mission is to ensure peace in East Asia. Even at this point, it still hopes that China will reflect on itself, limit the situation to the smallest possible scope, and seek a satisfactory solution as soon as possible." Just think, such inexplicable remarks, wanting to 'express peace' and 'urge Japan to be aware,' is it possible?

These are past mistakes.

Now Song believes that the situation is on the verge of a final moment, and peace is almost hopeless. Starting from the 27th, he decided to reject all unreasonable demands and prepare to fight for the survival of the country and the nation. The past is gone, the future can be pursued. Indeed, yesterday our army recovered Fengtai and Langfang, and attacked Tongzhou. When this manuscript was being written, firecrackers outside the window were deafening, as if it were the time when Chairman Chiang was in danger in Xi'an. The people in the neighborhood ran to tell each other: 'Fengtai has been recovered!' 'Langfang has been recovered!' An indescribable joy appeared on their faces. The bad mood that had been stifling in their hearts for the past ten days was completely vented at this moment. 'Only the determination to sacrifice to the end can win the final victory!'

Now that a full-scale war has begun, we should go further, not only 'respond to the war' but also 'seek war,' because 'when the final moment arrives, we can only sacrifice to the end and fight to the end...' We must use the power of our entire nation to give the enemy a head-on blow!

Let's see who owns the world in the city today?

### A Day of Triumph

— Ma Jia

Today (July 28th), I went out for some special business for half of the day, and didn't return home until 12:30 noon. After quickly eating lunch, I didn't care how hot the weather was, and I didn't care that I was sweating because of eating in a hurry. I hid in the attic, grabbed the Shen Bao, and started reading the newspaper. When I saw the big headline 'Song Officially Replies to Japanese Ultimatum, Strictly Rejects Unreasonable Demands,' I had already forgotten about the heat. I read every telegram carefully, like reading a great work of literature. The blood of anger and joy was rushing through the veins of my entire body.

I don't know how long I read, I only felt that I had already read all the telegrams about the international attitude towards me, and I was reading "Japanese Special Parliament Begins Questioning the War." That young Prime Minister Konoe was making his grand pronouncements, saying something like: "China's violence, we (referring to Japan) have been enduring and respecting ourselves..." I couldn't help but laugh when, suddenly, I clearly heard a sound: "Crack—Clap!" Because in this tense situation of panic, when I heard that kind of sound like a gunshot, I couldn't help but prick up my ears like a police dog. Then, the "crack-clap" sounds became denser, and the people in the family were also panicked. My mother had suffered the disaster of "January 28th," and she shouted in horror:

"Is there going to be another war?"

I wasn't sure either. After a while, I saw my father saying:

"Because of the solar eclipse, they are setting off firecrackers."

I said boringly and continued to read my Shen Bao. But the "crack-clap" sounds didn't stop for a moment, just a denser burst after another. My wife was downstairs talking to my father:

"Do you know how to set off firecrackers? The Japanese have been defeated!"

What? The Japanese have been defeated! Is this true? I hurriedly dropped the Shen Bao, ran barefoot down the stairs like rolling down the railing, and asked my wife this and that. I felt unsatisfied because the news was insufficiently reported, so I hurried back upstairs, put on my shoes, and ran outside.

Running out of the alley, the first thing I saw was our national flag all over the street, followed by a large crowd of people, all with genuine smiles from the bottom of their hearts. There was a watermelon stall in the alley, and that short hawker with a slightly cunning face, he generously took out a dollar and ran to the cigarette shop with a smile.

"Sell a dollar's worth! Sell a dollar's worth!"

His ugly old wife also followed with a smile. He held a bundle of big firecrackers and shouted loudly:

"Come and set them off! Ah ah..."

The children all crowded up. Then, the firecrackers exploded loudly one by one. Someone joked with him:

"Ah Mao! Did you earn a dollar today?"

"Who cares? As long as the Japanese soldiers suffer a few more defeats, what's this little money?"

I was so moved that I almost burst into tears. Across the alley was a Japanese-owned machine factory. The oil-stained faces of our Chinese workers, for some reason, were all clustered at the factory gate, their faces full of happy smiles. I paid close attention to them, but just then, a young black fellow came with a large pile of firecrackers. Then, a cry of joy erupted from the crowd. After a while, the sound of firecrackers bursting in the sky. The onlookers were a little surprised, and some even said this:

"The workers in their Eastern factory are also happy."

The onlookers all cast brotherly glances. I walked to another street, where the radio broadcasting machine at the door of the shop was broadcasting current affairs news. People were crowding there listening. Everyone shouted "Good!" when they heard "Fengtai Recovered!" "Langfang Recovered!" and that some Japanese aircraft fields were also recovered by us... Some even clapped their hands.

After listening to that current affairs news, I of course, with a joy that I had never felt since birth, walked forward. There was a cluster of people surrounding something. I pushed forward to take a look. It turned out that a fortune teller was reading a small extra to everyone. Of course, the listeners were all happy.

I walked forward again. There was also a large crowd of people next to a beef noodle stall. An old man with white hair was loudly scolding the Eastern people with saliva flying everywhere. He said, "If we Chinese people don't defeat them this time, it can truly be said that there is no distinction between heaven and earth!" As he spoke, he cursed with all the Ningbo swear words he knew, but the listeners didn't laugh. Everyone showed angry faces, and some also cursed heavily.

I turned to another street, where the corner was the tram station. Several trolley buses were parked there. I saw in a flash that three or four children were moving around frantically behind the tram. I walked forward to take a look. Ah ah! They were posting slogans. One of them was: "The 29th Army Has Won a Great Victory!" Later, I saw more of them, and that fat driver also squeezed up. One of the children was about to run away, but a pile of smiles suddenly welled up on that fat face: "It's okay! It's okay! You guys have posted them well!" Then he loudly said to everyone: "Our children also know how to save the country! Hmph! Is China still afraid of Japan?"

Watching the children so busy posting slogans, this thought floated into my mind: Today is a day for us to be proud and elated!

### Extra

— Li Yinfei

The people cooling off in the alley were gradually dispersing. Those who remained were casually lying on broken mats, exhaling sweet and even snores. Over there, under the street lamp, there were still people playing chess, but the number of people watching the game was obviously not as many as before.

The sound of mahjong upstairs had not stopped. At this time, it was even clearer. In addition to the sound of shuffling and playing cards, even the sound of arguing over one or two copper coins was clearly transmitted.

Because I didn't have any essential work to do during the day, and also because I didn't have the ability to fall asleep as soon as I lay down, I was rereading a friend's letter in the cool of the night, preparing to finish the reply that I hadn't finished writing last night.

My friend's letter was full of friendship. He said, "When the news of the Lugou Bridge Incident spread, the office was filled with joy every day. Everyone was praying for the arrival of the god of war. In this critical moment of survival, we can't find another way out except to fight hand-to-hand with our lives. 'See you on the front line with old friends,' the tragic words are very moving! Unfortunately, China still has millions of troops, even if war is inevitable, it still won't be necessary for a literati like you to go to the front line! And you are so thin, your body probably won't allow you to go to the front line; besides, in addition to the war of guns and flesh, the struggle of words is also indispensable. As long as we are loyal and patriotic, no matter where we are, whether on the front line or in writing, we can equally be loyal to the country, save it from ruin, and wash away the national shame! I hope you will value the pen more than the gun, awaken the masses, and win the sympathy of the world. These are all things that we pray our literary warriors will work hard for! Of course, we know that sympathy cannot reverse war or ruin, but our spiritual national defense cannot be lacking!..."

My friend is a military officer. He has a tall and strong body, just as he said in his previous letter about his recent situation: "I can only be comforted that my body has become more and more like a bull." So I said in my reply:

"I know that my body is not as strong as yours, but I think I can still go to the front line. I know that I can do nothing but write some so-called 'articles' that do not violate my conscience with my pen, but I think it would be more practical to use this pen to the front line to comfort some brothers who are going through life and death than to be in the rear. Even writing a couple of letters home for the wounded brothers is better than writing a few so-called 'arousing the masses' articles in the rear."

But when I wrote here, I couldn't write anymore. It wasn't that I didn't have a reason to persuade him, but rather that the situation in North China was supposedly "improving." I imagined that when he heard the news of the "improvement," he would also lament that there was no place for heroes to use their strength. So, why should I quibble over the words? So I put the letter aside, undecided on how I should tell him (to be continued)
