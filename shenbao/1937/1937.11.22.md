### I Abandon the Second Line of Defense in Changshu, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang

The Elite Troops in the Battle of Jiangyin Have Been Sent as Reinforcements; Military Leaders in the Capital Remain in Beijing to Command the Defense; After the Fall of Nanxun, I Build New Positions in Gucun

After two weeks of bloody battles, the left wing of our army has safely withdrawn from Fushan, Changshu, and Suzhou to the new positions of Wuxi and Jiangyin. The enemy is now making every effort to attack the Jiangyin Fortress in an attempt to break through our Yangtze River blockade. Our rear army is currently building strong fortifications in Zhenjiang and deploying a second line of defense on the river in case of emergency. In the capital, the entire population is unusually calm, and military leaders remain in Beijing to command the defense. More than twelve divisions of elite troops are stationed in the suburbs of the capital, sufficient for a strong defense. Meanwhile, after the enemy broke through our important strongholds of Jiaxing and Zhapu on the right wing, our new positions now defend the areas of Changchuan Dam, Shendang, Xiashi, and Tongxiang east of Ganpu. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway, the enemy has already made contact with our forces near Haiyan. Fierce fighting is taking place between the enemy and us east of Wangdian on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line. Another part of the enemy army in the Jiaxing area has crossed our Nanxun defense line and is advancing towards Wuxing, attempting to invade Nanjing via the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. Our reinforcements have arrived in Gucun, and we are determined to fight to the death against the enemy.

[Hangzhou] On the morning of the 20th, there was heavy rain. The enemy attacked westward from Jiaxing, and our army engaged in fierce blocking battles in Wuzhen, reaching a stalemate by evening. The enemy from the Nanxun area attacked westward at noon on the 20th, making contact with our forces in Gucun, resulting in intense fighting. Several enemy planes bombed Shengshan at around 7:00 AM on the 20th, but the losses are unknown.

### The Enemy Attempts to Break the Jiangyin Blockade

[Nanjing] According to reports from the Chinese side, Japanese warships have been heavily shelling Langshan and Fushan recently, with the obvious intention of breaking the blockade on the Jiangyin side. Furthermore, the fighting on the Suzhou-Jiaxing railway line is very intense, and Chinese reinforcements have been sent to the front lines to stop the enemy's advance. Therefore, new troops that opened the mountain from Nanjing are constantly on the way. (Central News Agency, 11th Reuters report)

[Nanjing] According to news from the Chinese side, Chinese troops in Fushan and Suzhou have retreated to new positions for strategic reasons and continue to resist the Japanese advance. Japanese troops in the Jiaxing area have crossed Nanxun and are advancing towards Wuxing, attempting to advance along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway.

### Our New Defense Line is 500 Li Long

In the Eastern Theater, our enemy has been fighting for more than 100 days. The initial front line was only 70 li in Songhu. Since the enemy landed in Jinshanwei, it has been extended to more than 200 li. Recently, the fighting has spread to Jiangyin and Wuxi, and the front line has been extended to more than 500 li. Our army on this new defense line can definitely achieve the goal of moving from a war of attrition to a war of main forces.

The China Eastern News Agency stated that although Suzhou and Changshu have fallen and the first line of national defense has been broken through by the enemy, our current position is actually advantageous. A reporter from the China Eastern News Agency met with a foreign observer in this city yesterday, who said, "Even if the Japanese army currently uses its tanks and mechanized units, Chinese soldiers can still use the terrain to launch guerrilla tactics. I am afraid that the Japanese army will find it difficult to advance deep in the future. The Japanese Marines in the swamps and rivers will also inevitably be ambushed by Chinese troops in the mountains and ridges." The China Eastern News Agency stated that after the left wing of our army moved back, it still remotely echoed the right wing. At present, the right wing of our army, Shanhaining, Haiyan, Xiashi, Chang'an, and other important points bordering Taihu Lake, remotely form a vertical line with Wuxi and Jiangyin. The city of Hangzhou is normal and has not been greatly affected.

### Hasegawa Commands Two Fleets

The *North China Daily News* reported that the Japanese Second and Third Fleets have now been merged into one, all under the command of Vice Admiral Hasegawa, and renamed the China Sea Fleet.

Subsequently, a Japanese naval spokesman claimed that the ship may be a Chinese gunboat, similar to a destroyer, and is one of the four ships estimated by the Japanese army. Two ships were towed to the lower reaches a few days ago, and one ship has now been requisitioned by the Japanese naval commander.

After the enemy troops landed, most of the ships sailed inland, mooring in the waters from Donggou to Huishan Wharf.

The Central News Agency reported that yesterday morning (the 21st) around 7:00 AM, the enemy transport ships "Nachisan Maru" docked at the China Merchants Bureau Central Warehouse, "Someono Maru" docked at Osaka Wharf, "Daisan Keihin Maru" docked at the Fish Market Wharf, and "Yayoi Maru" docked at New Huishan Wharf, carrying large quantities of military supplies, ammunition, and timber rafts, which were unloaded ashore and onto small barges, ready to be transported to the front.

### Yu Youren's Speech in Jiangxi

[Nanchang] President Yu Youren arrived in Jiangxi on the evening of the 20th. Reporters visited and he kindly received them and spoke as follows: I (President Yu referred to himself) relocated with the government from the Control Yuan, passing through Jiangxi Province, through Fuliang and other places, and saw the local people's spirit of common hatred against the enemy and the situation of comforting the soldiers. Upon arriving in the province, I saw the efforts of party, government, and military comrades, and I was very impressed. At this time of serious national crisis, what I can tell the people of the country is that the government's relocation is actually for the sake of implementing the spirit of resistance. As the declaration says, one is to prevent an alliance under the city, and the other is to strengthen the determination to resist, so that we can calmly plan for a large scale, so that the generals and soldiers in the front and the people in the rear know that the government has no intention of seeking temporary security. If everyone has the thought of laziness, they will be prisoners of the people in their hearts. If everyone can value themselves, unite their strength under the leadership of the central government, then everyone will be a defender of the city, and every place will be a stronghold. Our anti-enemy formation will definitely be stronger. Moreover, the international situation has already changed, and those who sympathize with us are now helping with real strength. We can gain the expectations of world justice, and we also have the supreme power of national unity. Although the enemy is fierce and cruel, the time to wipe them out is not far away.

### The Nine-Power Treaty Conference Will Hold its Final Meeting Today

Consider a Common Attitude Based on the Declaration; Peaceful Countries Are Afraid to Resist Aggression; The Major Powers Cannot Shirk the Blame for the Failure of the Conference

Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to resume its meeting on the 22nd in order to consider a common attitude in accordance with the provisions of the final paragraph of the declaration. The chief representative of the United States, Davis, and the acting chief representative of the United Kingdom, Malcolm MacDonald, recently held talks with the chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, former Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, and consulted for a long time on the agenda of the conference. The chief representative of China, namely the country's ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, has arrived here from Paris. (Central News Agency, 20th Havas report)

Brussels: European representatives at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference stated here today that the strict neutrality of the United States has led to the despair of international mediation of the Far East dispute. The representatives will reconvene once next Monday, probably formally voting to recognize that Japan's actions in China are purely an aggressive policy. British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Dalbos, knowing that the United States would not join other countries to stop Japan's oppression, decided not to attend the last meeting. According to general observations, European diplomats may blame the United States for the ineffectiveness of this meeting. Chinese representatives are particularly disappointed with the results of this meeting, saying that the failure of this Nine-Power Conference indicates that peace-loving nations are afraid to resist aggression. According to news here today, a new proposal may be put forward at the final meeting next Monday to form another committee, including the United States, France, and Belgium, to continue to study the Far East issue. If the situation improves, the committee may have the hope of reconvening the general meeting. (20th National Telegram)

[Washington] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with Secretary of State Hull today. Afterwards, Pittman said that it is ridiculous that Brussels criticized the United States for being responsible for the failure of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The holding of this conference was originally hoped to achieve something. If it is said that other countries are restricted by the United States' neutrality law and have failed to take action, then it is extremely ridiculous. Even if the provisions of the neutrality law are unexpectedly changed, what can the US Congress claim out of thin air, because Brussels has not yet made any concrete proposals. Pittman believes that the United States should act alone in the future, but still cooperate with other countries as much as possible. (20th National Telegram)

[Paris] French Foreign Minister Dalbos successively received League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, and British Ambassador Phillips today. It is said that the conversations of these people were all related to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency, 20th Reuters report)

### Roosevelt's Foreign Policy

Due to the Failure of the Brussels Conference, the Atmosphere in Congress is Not Good

[Washington] The first week of the special session of Congress failed to establish any constructive bills. It is said that the reason for the unsatisfactory progress is that the parties are strongly active in supporting and opposing President Roosevelt's foreign policy. At the same time, members of Congress have generally expressed disgust with the results of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying that the United States has been trapped and is burdened with the blame for the failure of the conference. Others said that all democratic countries should share the blame for failing to take a strong policy. The conversations in the parliament lounge recognize that the rapid progress of the Anglo-American Commercial Treaty is used to cover up the collapse of the Brussels Conference, so that the public's thoughts and status will not converge on the "cowardice" record of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency, 21st Havas report)

[Washington] It is rumored that isolationists intend to submit a petition to Congress, requesting the recall of the country's representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Davis, to avoid the United States being involved in the whirlpool of the Far East incident. Responsible persons believe that this statement may not be reliable, and said that Davis will return to the country after the end of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to rest. (Central News Agency, 20th Havas report)

### France Sees Benefits from Vietnam

[Paris] Colonial Minister Moutet recently made a statement to the press, saying that it is necessary for France's various colonies to set up appropriate defenses.

As far as the Far East is concerned, France's interests in the Pacific are very important, especially French Vietnam. Therefore, the Governor-General's Office of Vietnam and the French embassies and consulates in various Far Eastern countries should maintain regular contact. (Central News Agency, 20th Havas report)

### The Philippines Give Up Independence

Philippine President Quezon's Proposal; American Senators Express Support

[Washington] Republican Senator Gibson greatly supports Philippine President Quezon's proposal to give up independence and only demand autonomous status. According to his meaning, in the current situation in the Far East, it is more appropriate to make the Philippines obtain the status of a self-governing territory than complete independence. Democratic Senator McClellan claimed that making the Philippines completely independent is not only not beneficial to the Philippines, but also harmful to the United States. I deeply believe that if the Philippines is completely isolated and helpless, it will be swallowed up by other powerful countries. But if the Philippines only obtains the status of an autonomous territory, I do not agree. Only if we want to bear the responsibility of protection, we must manipulate its diplomatic rights and customs rights, and station powerful naval and land forces on the island. However, Tydings and others who drafted the Philippine Independence Act have not yet expressed their opinions. (19th National Telegram)

### British Universities Raise Funds

To Help the Expenses of Universities Outside My War Zone

[London] Students from British universities, seminaries, and technical colleges have now raised 1,500 British pounds to help maintain the expenses of universities outside the Chinese war zone.

### Commercial Shipping Between Shanghai and the United States

Will Resume Soon

In the initial stage, goods shipped to Shanghai may be shipped to any port for unloading if it is not convenient to unload in Shanghai. (Central News Agency, 21st Reuters report)

### A Model Soldier

Returned from the Front Line and Unwilling to Return Home; Donates the Reward Money from His Superior to the Country

Bengbu Correspondence: In this war of resistance against Japan in Shanghai, everyone fought bravely and desperately. The Feng Xingxian Department of the 33rd Division was particularly brave in resisting the enemy in Nanxiang. Ming Yanchen, a first-class soldier in the division, is from Hao County, northern Anhui Province, and is 34 years old. He is deeply admired by his peers for his bravery in combat. Recently, when he was in the process of reorganizing the troops, he was ordered to return home, and his superior rewarded him with 150 yuan in national currency for his mother to save money for him to marry a wife. Ming arrived in Bengbu by car a few days ago and stayed at the Huaiying Hotel behind the train station. Driven by patriotism, he voluntarily went to the Central Bank on the 11th and bought national salvation bonds for 50 yuan. Then he went to the Bengbu Anti-Enemy Support Association and donated 30 yuan to comfort the soldiers in the front. A reporter was introduced by someone and personally saw the receipts given by the two agencies. Ming was dressed in tattered military uniforms and looked extremely simple and honest, but his heroic spirit overflowed between his eyebrows. At first glance, he knew that he was a brave and good soldier. It is said that he joined the army five years ago. The troops fought in Nanxiang, and the officers and soldiers sacrificed a lot. He did not want to return home. When the troops are reorganized or there are other opportunities, he is still willing to go to the front line to kill the enemy and recover the lost land.

### Minyuan Held a Meeting to Promote Military Service and Raise Bonds

### Random Notes from Lieshan

— Feng Lieshan

Soviet Russia and the Jews

The Jews are perhaps the most unfortunate people in the world. Although some of them possess wealth, they still cannot avoid being discriminated against everywhere. Hitler was not the inventor of "anti-Semitism." He merely exaggerated the Jewish problem in particular, and as a result, everyone found his face particularly terrifying. In fact, the idea of excluding Jews has almost become a common phenomenon in European society. The only exceptions are socialists and "humanitarians." Only these people do not talk about racial issues.

During the Tsarist era, Russian Jews were also among the oppressed nationalities. When the Soviet revolutionary movement broke out, the Jews were the main backbone. For example, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Radek, Joffe, Litvinov, and so on. It is said that someone once questioned Lenin, asking why more than half of his close associates were Jews, which would inevitably arouse the resentment of the Russian people. Lenin replied that the Russian people were from an industrially backward country, and only people like Trotsky could complete the proletarian revolution. There should be no distinction between who is Russian and who is Jewish here. Since then, Jews in Soviet Russia have not only received equal treatment, but have even had considerable real power in politics. After Lenin's death, Trotsky was expelled, and Stalin took sole control of power, but the status of Jews in Soviet Russia has never wavered. About a year or two ago, a Soviet citizen of Jewish origin once said that the Jews living in Soviet Russia felt very happy and had no other hopes. Yes, comparing the Jews of Soviet Russia with the Jews of other countries, they naturally have reasons to be satisfied.

However, whether this phenomenon can last seems to be a question. Jews are a minority in Soviet Russia, but they occupy a leading position in the government. The power struggle between Stalin and Trotsky was mainly due to the conflict of political views and ideas, but another reason was also the trace of conflict between Russians and Jews. Recently, it has often been said that Stalin was influenced by Hitler's racial theory and became a Great Russian nationalist, and that he might start to exclude Jews in the future. This statement is naturally a joke about Stalin. However, things are so coincidental that the three major counter-revolutionary cases that have been tried in Moscow in the past six months have been headed by Jews in eight or nine out of ten cases. As a result, it has also raised a question in our minds as to whether these people are in contact with Trotsky because they are all Jews, hoping to restore the golden age of a few years ago?

No matter how the German newspapers attack Stalin, saying that he has completely Judaized Soviet politics, the reason is only because Stalin's deceased wife was a Jewish woman. In fact, Stalin's political measures in recent years seem to lead to the opposite conclusion. Whether this is due to a predetermined plan or an accidental fact is another matter. Stalin not only seized the Red Army from Trotsky's hands, but also replaced the Minister of the Interior, a Jew, with a genuine Russian. (The Ministry of the Interior is the former famous political police bureau.) Even the Soviet Foreign Ministry, which had always been monopolized by Jews, has recently undergone changes. The newly appointed Soviet ambassador to Germany (a Jew) has been transferred to be the ambassador to France. (It is said that the successor will be Russian.) The original ambassador to France, Potemkin (a genuine Russian), was transferred to be the Deputy Commissar of Foreign Affairs. Since the former Foreign Minister Chicherin left office, this is the first time that a Russian has held such an important position in the Soviet Foreign Ministry.

In recent years, counter-revolutionary cases have occurred from time to time in Soviet Russia. The content is complicated, and the news we read is very contradictory. Although the Soviet authorities never mention the Jewish issue, we have synthesized the facts from all aspects and always feel that there are some "clues." This point may help us understand the current party struggle in Soviet Russia. Perhaps Stalin's handling methods still represent the opinions of many Soviet people! Of course, this is a statement. However, whether it is an important reason in the Soviet party struggle is still up to the experts on Soviet Russia to study!

It's Hard to Be a Journalist

It is not easy to make a living as a journalist. Many senior veterans in the industry warn us with these words. What they mean is not just that the status of journalists is difficult. It is not necessarily possible to write out everything that is known, so there is a moral problem for readers, and there is a suspicion of deceiving readers. On the other hand, journalists are reporters of society. Their responsibility is to report various social events to readers accurately every day. In this way, every journalist should have sufficient common sense in all aspects. How easy it is for a person to become an encyclopedia! Many knowledgeable experts often feel that the articles in the newspapers are shallow. In our opinion, if we have not made any mistakes, it is already our responsibility to be slightly shallow. Because experts are only a very small number of readers in our eyes. To put it bluntly, what we write is not for experts at all. Our target is the general public of readers!

A scholar spends several years or decades writing a book, so his work is naturally not prone to error. A journalist does not have this blessing. His writing is completed in a very short period of time. He has to rush out in a few hours, and the news will become old news the next day. Which reader is willing to read it? Precisely because of the excessive haste, there is always a risk of making jokes. This is a common problem for journalists at home and abroad, the only question is the difference between big mistakes and small mistakes. The only exceptions are newspapers in the United Kingdom and the United States. Most of the newspaper industry in these two countries is large-scale, and there are at least dozens of internal affairs reporters. Every news article has to be revised and embellished by several people before it is printed. As a result, there are fewer jokes in British and American newspapers.

For example, after the news of King Edward VIII's abdication last year, the British correspondent of the German Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur hurriedly sent a special telegram to Germany, saying that the new King Albert I was about to succeed to the throne. Many German newspapers printed it as it was that day. The reporter made this mistake because he was too hurried. Originally, Queen Victoria's prince consort was called Albert. For this reason, the current King of England is not Albert I, but George VI. Nowadays, the old British socialist Lansbury (former leader of the Labour Party) went to Berlin to visit Hitler to discuss world peace issues. Dr. Goebbels' mouthpiece, the propaganda minister of Germany, called Lansbury Lord Lansbury, which may have other intentions, but the fact that Lansbury is not an aristocrat is well known. As a result, the common sense problem of journalists arises. England and Germany are so close to each other, and it is so easy to make jokes. It can be seen that it is difficult to be a journalist.

I remember that last year, the editor-in-chief of a European newspaper (who was a reporter) wrote an editorial about China. The article regarded Lanzhou and Gansu as two provinces in China. Also, last autumn, when the Chinese football team was competing in London, several major British newspapers said that Li Huitang was a medical student, and said that this medical student played very well. Why did Li Huitang change his career for no reason? I have thought about it and I can't figure out the answer.

### Preliminary Talks Conclude Satisfactorily, British Privy Councillor Leaves Berlin for Home

German Foreign Minister to Formally Invite London, Clarification of European Situation Awaits Future Negotiations

[Berlin] After British Privy Councillor Lord Halifax returned to Berlin this morning from Berchtesgaden, the British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson hosted a banquet in his honor in the evening. Many German government officials were also invited to attend. Lord Halifax is scheduled to return home tomorrow. It is generally understood that the main topic of discussion between the Councillor and the German authorities was the conclusion of the Western European Treaty, while the colonial issue was not discussed at all. (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)

[Berlin] An official told the Associated Press today that Führer Hitler had shown Viscount Halifax "credible evidence" indicating that Hitler was truly willing to maintain peace in Europe. Halifax had requested Foreign Minister Neurath to go to England for further discussions. If Neurath meets with British Foreign Secretary Eden in the future, the current informal talks can be given the significance of formal negotiations. It is understood that Germany's position is to establish a mutual understanding with Britain, which is different from France's proposed "collective" treaty. Therefore, diplomatic circles in other countries feel that Germany's position is difficult to achieve because the relationship between Britain and France is very deep, and Britain would not want to harm the relationship between Britain and France in order to establish an understanding with Germany. (National Telegram, 20th)

[Berlin] Today, General Göring invited Lord Halifax to lunch. It is said that Halifax will meet with Defence Minister Blomberg and National Bank President Schacht at the banquet. According to political figures here, the causes of the tense situation in Europe have been explored in these talks. Halifax has been able to recognize the authenticity of the German-Italian Axis, that is, Germany's conclusion of this axis has no intention of hostility towards other countries. (Haitong Telegram, 20th)

[Berlin] Regarding the British Privy Councillor Lord Halifax's invitation to German Foreign Minister Neurath to visit London, the German government has practically expressed its acceptance, but in fact, there still needs to be some diplomatic arrangements. It may not be possible to prepare it before Christmas. What needs to be noted in this regard is that since Germany insists that Britain must recognize its right to equal rights before it is willing to continue talks, and Germany has already agreed to put aside the colonial issue and is willing to establish a new Locarno Treaty to protect the borders of Western European countries, this has also been denied by well-informed German sources. In this way, even if a future Western European Treaty is concluded, although Germany solemnly declares that it will protect Belgian neutrality, it will only do so on the condition that other countries accept the same restrictions. What kind of attitude it holds towards Southern and Eastern Europe has not been revealed, and naturally no one knows. What can be said at this time is that the German diplomatic authorities should refuse to participate in future negotiations that involve the principle of collective security. German diplomatic figures also said that if the League of Nations Covenant is not amended one day, Germany's attitude towards the League of Nations will not be changed for one day. (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)

[London] People here are generally interested in the news that German Foreign Minister Neurath has been invited to Britain. British diplomatic figures also said that after Privy Councillor Lord Halifax went to Germany to hold talks with the German authorities, he had clearly inquired about the German views on certain issues. However, it is difficult to estimate the real value of the content of the talks. Therefore, although optimistic news about the Councillor's trip can be satisfactory, it should also be treated with caution. (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)

[London] Regarding the Privy Councillor Lord Halifax's visit to Germany, the Conservative Party's organ newspaper "The Observer" recently commented, "If the results of Lord Halifax's talks with German Führer Hitler were not satisfactory, Lord Halifax would not have invited German Foreign Minister Neurath to come to London for talks. Officials from both Britain and Germany believe that both sides can now take a second step to establish an understanding between the two countries. The so-called second step is to propose a concrete plan to make a decision. People here also believe that if the British government does not want to miss the opportunity, it should make suggestions to the German government as soon as possible." (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)

[Berlin] Today, the "Hamburger Nachrichten" commented on Lord Halifax's visit to Germany, declaring that Halifax would report the impression of his talks with Hitler in Germany to British Prime Minister Chamberlain. Chamberlain hopes that the two countries will establish an understanding. Whether there will be further progress in British-German relations in the future will depend on Chamberlain's decision. The newspaper pointed out that it would be too early to speculate on this issue at this time, because Britain has not yet decided its attitude based on the impression conveyed by Halifax. The "Berliner Vier-Uhr-Blatt" emphasized that the meeting took place at a time when the Far East and Spain were in conflict and the international situation was extremely tense. The entire world political situation is still very gloomy. Therefore, we hope that the international situation will be clarified before the British and German politicians hold further consultations. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)

[Paris] Well-informed sources here have declared that the French Foreign Ministry has not yet received a formal report on the results of the British Privy Councillor's talks with the German Führer and other dignitaries. However, judging from the fact that Britain has invited German Foreign Minister Neurath to visit Britain, these people believe that the results of the talks in Berchtesgaden and Berlin must be very satisfactory. Political circles believe that the Halifax-Hitler talks must be related to the Central European issue and are extremely interested in the possibility of Germany returning to the League of Nations to participate in disarmament talks. They also stated that if this possibility is realized one day, all the problems that are considered unsolvable today will be solved. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)

### Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Visit Berlin

[Berlin] Hungarian Prime Minister Darányi and Foreign Minister Kánya arrived here this morning and immediately met with Führer Hitler and met with the dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, General Göring, and Foreign Minister Neurath. (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)

### Italy to Close Five Consulates in Russia

German Consulates Also to Be Reduced

[Moscow] Diplomatic negotiations between the Soviet and Italian governments on the issue of consulates have ended today. As a result, the Italian government agreed to close its consulate general in Kyiv, consulates in Leningrad and Tbilisi, and vice-consulates in Novosibirsk and Batumi before January 20 next year. (TASS Telegram, 20th)

[Berlin] Regarding the closure of several German consulates in Soviet Russia, political figures here stated that this change was due to the sharp decline in the number of Germans residing in Russia over the years, and the great decline in German-Soviet trade. They also said that there is now a tendency for German-Soviet trade to be concentrated in Moscow, so there is no need to maintain the previous large number of consulates. In addition to Moscow, Germany will only establish two consulates in Russia in the future, one in Kyiv and one in Novosibirsk. It is believed here that Soviet Russia will take the same approach to German consulates, closing some and only leaving two in major commercial ports. (Haitong Telegram, 20th)

### Japan to Recognize the Spanish Rebel Government Soon

Salamanca - The Associated Press learned today from authoritative sources that the Spanish Chargé d'Affaires in Japan has reached an agreement with the Japanese government that Japan will soon formally recognize the Nationalist government. It is understood that at the beginning of the civil war, Japan was negotiating a treaty with Spain. Now this treaty will be signed by the Nationalist government. (National Telegram, 21st)

### Italian Giornale d'Italia Advocates Promoting Relations with France

Confiscated by the Authorities

[Rome] The Giornale d'Italia here published an article yesterday advocating the promotion of friendly relations between France and Italy. The authorities recently ordered the confiscation of the newspaper issued yesterday. It is generally believed that since the British-German talks, foreign newspapers have said that Italy intends to make peace with France in order to respond. In order to prevent the spread of this argument, the Italian authorities confiscated the Giornale d'Italia. (Central News Agency, Havana, 20th)

[Paris] After the Italian Giornale d'Italia published an article the day before yesterday advocating the promotion of friendly relations between France and Italy, it was ordered to be confiscated by the Italian government. This matter has recently been commented on by French newspapers. Le Matin reported, "The article published by the newspaper could have been a solid foundation for improving relations between France and Italy. The Italian government actually ordered it to be confiscated 24 hours after the newspaper was published. It would be regrettable if this move were not actually effective. Does the Italian government intend to express that the improvement of relations between France and Italy must be carried out within the scope of the German-Italian Axis?" Le Journal reported, "This move by the Italian government cannot be regarded as opposing the improvement of relations between France and Italy. It just does not want to take the initiative to initiate it. Its confiscation of the Giornale d'Italia is actually a firm denial of the views put forward in an article by the newspaper's Paris correspondent." (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)

### Belgian Cabinet Stillborn

Johnson's Cabinet Formation Fails Again

Brussels - Former Belgian cabinet member Johnson, a member of the Liberal Party, has also declared his failure after being authorized by the Belgian King to form a cabinet. It is said that the reason for his failure is that the Socialist Party refused to work with former Catholic Prime Minister Jaspar. It has been nearly a month since Belgium has been in a state of anarchy since Tsiran resigned. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 21st)

### Conspiracy to Overthrow the Government Uncovered in Paris

Authorities Take Stringent Measures to Suppress the Budding of Disorder, Many Extreme Right-Wingers Expelled

[Paris] According to a reliable source, the authorities uncovered the conspiracy to overthrow the government this time thanks to a tip-off from Rocque, the former leader of the Croix-de-Feu. This conspiracy is consistent with the views of the Croix-de-Feu, but its leaders are extremists, and Rocque does not approve of using violent means, so their views diverge, and they reported it to the government. At the same time, the Ministry of the Interior announced that the government has completely investigated the inside story of the conspiracy. None of the leaders can hope to escape the net. Thousands of detectives have been secretly deployed at all border crossings, airports, and train stations to prevent these leaders from fleeing the country before the list is announced. Currently, this list has not yet been announced, and there are rumors that it is related to "a certain country." (National Telegram, 21st)

[Paris] When the truth about the revolutionary conspiracy detected by the government is announced, it will reveal an extremely scandalous history. It is still remembered that before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the government also discovered a revolutionary organization. Therefore, the government authorities are taking strict measures to suppress this movement. After Prime Minister Chautemps obtained the power to handle this matter in the House of Representatives yesterday, 87 right-wing figures sympathetic to the Spanish Nationalist government have been expelled from the country today. Another hundred people will be expelled next week. According to official statements, the sources of support for the conspiracy are mostly on the border crossings. The government has seized countless military supplies, and important military locations have secretly hidden radio equipment. (National Telegram, 20th)

[Paris] French police authorities are now mobilizing nationwide to search for members of secret organizations attempting to harm the country. According to an official from the police, the truth about the discovery of the conspirators' arsenals and financial resources will be announced soon. Traffic on railways and airlines is currently being closely monitored to prevent the leaders of the secret organization from escaping abroad. As of now, none of the names of the conspirators have been announced, but the police have learned that many prominent figures are involved. (Haitong Telegram, 20th)

### Romanian Parliament Dissolved, Re-election

[Rome] It has been formally announced here that the parliament has been dissolved. The election for the Lower House is scheduled to be held on December 20. The election for the Upper House is scheduled to be held on December 22. The new parliament will convene on February 17 next year. (Haitong Telegram, 20th)

### Brazil Suspends Foreign Debt Payments

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - Since the coup in Brazil on the 10th of this month, President Vargas issued a statement saying that he would temporarily suspend the payment of foreign debt interest and principal in order to improve the country's economic organization. The government has now followed this statement and decided to suspend the payment of foreign debt interest and principal from today. It has also authorized the Minister of Finance to start negotiations with the countries concerned to formulate new agreements in accordance with Brazil's financial resources. However, this will not affect commercial debts. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 20th)

### The Issue of the Albanian Emperor's Status

Depends on the Judgment of the British Court

[London] According to the "Sunday Dispatch," whether the Ethiopian Emperor Selassie I still retains the status of Emperor of Albania will be determined by the British High Court. Two years ago, an American consortium and the Abyssinian government conducted negotiations. The American bank provided loans to the Albanian government to operate the country's mining industry. As a result of the negotiations, the bank opened by American Jew Geldock released 25,000 pounds to the Albanian Emperor Selassie. In addition, Geldock purchased approximately 15,000 square miles of mining rights in Albania in 1935 for a price of 1 million pounds. Later, Italy occupied Albanian territory. In order to avoid causing international disputes, Geldock abandoned the above-mentioned mining plan and filed a lawsuit with the British court, demanding compensation for losses from the Albanian Emperor. Therefore, the Albanian Emperor either refused to appear in court and accepted a default judgment, or he had to turn himself in and appear in court in person. However, according to British law, foreign monarchs enjoy privileges and cannot be prosecuted by the court. However, whether the current status of the Albanian Emperor is still a foreign monarch is now awaiting a ruling by the British High Court. (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)

### British-African Flight

Round Trip in Five Days, Seventeen Hours - British Lady Creates New Record

[London] The round-trip flight between London and Cape Town by female pilot Lady Cobham and her companion Crosstown has now come to a successful conclusion yesterday. Cobham and others arrived at Croydon Airport here at 3:23 pm yesterday. After departing from Cairo, they encountered high-speed storms over the Mediterranean, but were finally able to reach London directly without stopping in between. This flight round trip took only five days, seventeen hours, and twenty-seven minutes, breaking the previous record of seven days, twenty-two minutes, and forty-two seconds set by Amy Johnson. The actual round-trip flight time was only seventy-seven hours and forty-eight minutes. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 21st)

### Diplomatic and Overseas Chinese Circles Discuss Poland's Attitude Towards China

Always Maintaining Friendly Relations　Absolutely No Opposition to China in Any Way

A certain gentleman in diplomatic circles, who has resided in Poland for many years, recently returned from overseas and spoke in detail about the political situation in Poland. First, he discussed Poland's attitude towards the League of Nations in Geneva, believing that all issues raised in the League of Nations Assembly should be discussed by all members of the League, and should absolutely not be discussed by a small number of powerful countries or organizations outside the League. Poland believes that these meetings of a small number of powerful countries may be able to resolve disputes, but whether the resolutions made by these few powerful countries can be observed by all members of the League is a very big question. Because the strategy adopted by the League of Nations is different from Poland's views, the Polish representative finds it difficult to vote in favor. As for the Polish representative not advocating the use of the word "aggression" in the League of Nations Assembly, it was based on the failure of the previous vote. If the word "aggression" is adopted, the next step will be "sanctions." In fact, since sanctions are difficult to succeed, it is better to use other methods. Otherwise, if sanctions fail again, the collective security system of the League of Nations will collapse, so it must be treated with caution. Therefore, the Polish representative's move was for the sake of the future of the League of Nations, and there was absolutely no intention to oppose China. Therefore, in the meeting, the Polish representative only abstained from voting, and did not vote against it. The gentleman further said that the Polish government has repeatedly explained that it expresses sympathy and goodwill towards China and has no malice. For example, in previous League of Nations meetings, the Polish representative had repeatedly supported China's proposals, such as those concerning international labor issues and the anti-smoking issue. In addition, the League of Nations Technical Cooperation Committee for China sent the head of the health team, a Polish man named Raczyman, to China to assist the Chinese government in planning, reorganizing the port quarantine system, and establishing a national health design office. Okinski, a Polish Warsaw engineering consultant, was also appointed as the League of Nations Transport Group's representative in China. Mr. Okinski made great contributions to the construction of Chinese highways. Polish missionaries in China often provide great assistance to poor Chinese people. Bishop Palaci of Poland, who recently came to China, donated more than 1,000 Polish zlotys to the victims of the Sichuan disaster. Last year, in order to promote Sino-Polish cultural relations, the Polish Ministry of Education donated a scholarship for two years, totaling three to four thousand Polish zlotys, to Chinese students studying in Poland. Moreover, Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, has repeatedly stated that Poland will not join the Anti-Communist Pact. All of these are sufficient to prove that China and Poland have very friendly relations. Moreover, both China and Poland are countries struggling in adversity, and they should express sympathy to each other, and so on. The above are all facts. According to his observation, Poland's attitude towards China has always maintained friendly relations, but it is unlikely that there will be any ill will at this time. It can also be asserted.

### Mine Collapse in Gunma Prefecture, Japan

Seven Hundred People Buried Alive　Sulfur Warehouses Completely Destroyed

The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports that at 3:40 PM on the 11th, in Tsumagoi Village, Agatsuma County, Gunma Prefecture, near the border of Nagano Prefecture, a sudden landslide occurred at the Mikogushi Mine of the Hokkaido Sulfur Company (Mitsui affiliate). About 1,300 people living in the area and related to the mine, of whom six to seven hundred were completely buried alive in the mine. Nearby houses were also shaken and collapsed. At the same time, a fire broke out in the mountain dwellings, and all the sulfur warehouses were completely destroyed by the fire. Cries for help could be heard for miles. In addition, due to three inches of accumulated snow, the cries of hunger and cold were unbearable to witness. On the same day, the supervisor of the Tokyo Mining Supervision Bureau happened to be inspecting the mine on official business, and there is fear there is no hope for his survival. The Tokyo Ministry of Commerce and Industry urgently dispatched Supervisor Konishi to the scene to investigate the truth.

### German General Ludendorff Ill

[Berlin] Ludendorff, a famous German general during the European War, recently fell ill and underwent surgery. The progress is satisfactory. However, Ludendorff is a figure of great interest to the German people, and his illness has once again become a topic of conversation regarding his relationship with the Third Reich. It is said that there is a reason why General Ludendorff has clashed with the National Socialist government. The General and his wife founded the German Theosophical Society, which has hundreds of thousands of followers and is very powerful. This new and different religion does not entirely accept National Socialism. Furthermore, recent German school textbooks record the first National Socialist uprising in Munich on November 9, 1923, but do not mention the merits established by Ludendorff at that time. Ludendorff specifically protested this matter. In addition, a type of letter has recently been discovered in various parts of Germany, secretly distributed everywhere. The contents severely criticized the policies of Führer Hitler, especially his foreign policy, stating, "Spain and the Soviet Union should not become the targets of German foreign policy, and even less so Italy." Finally, it was said, "Long live freedom!" This secret letter is rumored to have been written by General Ludendorff. After Ludendorff protested, the police authorities declared that the letter was forged. It can be seen from these various things that General Ludendorff and the National Socialist government are not entirely in harmony. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

### Adventures in Pudong

— Fang Shu

From Nan Gaoqiao to Bei Gaoqiao

The author crossed to Pudong on September 25th and stayed there for more than fifty days in total, traveling all over the three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha, and learned about the local people's characteristics. Now, I will record the general outline of my adventurous experiences as I remember them:

On the gloomy morning of December 7th, three enemy planes began bombing Fengcheng in Fengxian County, without stopping for a moment from morning to night. At this time, the so-called Special Operations Team began its work of saving the country. (Temporarily serving as rescue and burial). On the morning of the first day (8th), six enemy planes soared over Fengcheng, bombing alternately. In the afternoon, they switched to artillery, and every minute, the sound of "whoosh... boom" continued incessantly. Around 6:00 PM that night, the sound of artillery subsided for a short time, and then a grinding sound approached. With a bang, the people of Nan Gaoqiao were scattered in shock. After investigation, the Japanese army bombed three kitchens of the Catholic Church again, slightly injuring two old people. Our garrison was less than a mile away from Fengcheng, so to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, we moved to Liangdian. That night, we could see shameless traitors releasing various different signals. On the 11th, we returned to Taizhen. That night, the sentries caught two verified traitors. They had firecrackers for releasing signals, white silk and small copper counterfeit coins in their pockets. Not only did he admit to being a traitor himself, but he also confessed his leader. People were immediately sent to arrest him, hoping to wipe them out in one fell swoop, but he had already received the news and escaped without a trace. As a result, his confidant was caught. After three trials, he admitted to the traitorous acts without hesitation. So, at about 1:00 AM on the 12th, three gunshots were fired, ending the lives of the three traitors.

On the 13th, we arrived at Xinchang. Just as we were having breakfast, the Xinchang Militia Team in the town came into contact with the Special Operations Team, fighting for about two hours and killing two traitors. At this time, our companions were scattered, leaving only me and Tao. That night, we stayed in Nanhui City.

On the 14th, a few more companions joined us temporarily. Tao and I walked for five days, sleeping in the rice straw, eating raw sweet potatoes. Everyone felt weak in their hands and feet and could not move forward, so we hired two small boats. Small boats are the best means of transportation in Pudong. When the boat arrived at Sifantuan, the so-called Militia Team, under the guise of inspection, actually took advantage of the fire to loot. They sent our twelve companions in distress from the boat to the town office. They all said in unison that we were traitors and could not be released. Later, after repeated explanations from me, Tao, and Hua, we were released. We were very grateful to a Mr. Zhou at the time, because he released us and also asked a guide to accompany us to Zhujiaqiao. However, a traitor is a traitor after all, with a heart as poisonous as ink. Just as we were approaching Zhujiaqiao, gunshots rang out. At the time, we were all confused, so we still moved forward. Later, the gunshots became more and more dense, and a wave of shouts of killing rushed towards us. We then realized the intention of the gunshots, and all scattered and lay down. I crossed the fields, jumped over the river, and lay on the sleepers in the middle of the railroad tracks, using the locomotive as cover. The bullets of the traitors flew over my head seven or eight times. I forgot about life and death and was very calm. But what was painful was not dying at the hands of the real enemy, but at the hands of traitors acting as accomplices. Later, they tied our hands behind our backs with grass ropes, searched our entire bodies, and plundered all our meager possessions, and locked us in three desolate empty houses. We sat in a semi-circular form on the brick floor, which was hard and cold. Looking around, it was full of guard posts, simply treating us like robbers. About an hour later, a young military officer in a Zhongshan suit came. Our twelve companions sized him up and then he left. We were not afraid at all and prepared to die. It turned out that this young military officer was the Security Team. Not long after, Zhang and Li said to us, "Because you are all related to ×××, we will let you go back." Of course, we were extraordinarily happy to gain hope of life in the midst of the despair of death. At 4:00 PM, we took a small train from Zhujiaqiao to Xinlu, and rushed to Bei Gaoqiao overnight. On the morning of the 15th, an Italian merchant ship sent our twelve companions, who had narrowly escaped death, to Shanghai.

Finally, I must explain that there are no real enemies in Pudong. Even if there are, they only land along the Huangpu River and leave, and do not stay. The so-called Japanese people in a certain place and Japanese people in a certain place are all rumors spread by traitors.

### The Jiaying Steamer Loaded with Tribute Rice to Help Civilian Food Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Registration of Rice Shops and Payment Procedures Need to be Completed Urgently　Unloading Begins This Morning and Can Be Sold on the Market This Afternoon

After the Shanghai Public Concession Board and the South China Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase foreign rice to regulate the food supply for Shanghai citizens, the first batch of Saigon rice, loaded on the British Taikoo Company's Xi Ying steamer, was imported at 1:20 PM yesterday. At 4:30 PM, it docked on the Huangpu River in front of the Taikoo Company in the French Concession. The total number was 25,000 bags, with 20,000 bags distributed to various rice shops for retail and 5,000 bags used for refugee relief. The Rice Shop Association has completed the payment procedures for 500 member rice shops and is allowed to start unloading this morning. The association will distribute 40 bags to each rice shop, and it will no longer be stored in warehouses. Because the foreign rice has been specially approved by our government to be exempt from import duties, the unloading procedures are very simple. It is scheduled that from this afternoon, 500 rice shops in the two concessions can sell it at a fair price, and the price per catty has been reduced to 8.5 cents. The second and third batches of rice that have been reordered will also be shipped to Shanghai by the end of this month. In addition, Siamese rice directly ordered from the Hengfeng Rice Mill in Siam by Lai Shang, totaling more than 2,500 bags, is expected to arrive in Shanghai for delivery around the 28th of this month. In addition, the Shanghai Rice Shop Association held an emergency meeting yesterday, attended by Zhang Nianxuan, Huang Rufeng, Gu Yuqing, Hu Xiangang, Xia Tongfu, Su Boxun, Xu Zhenyue, etc. First, Chairman Zhang Nianxuan proposed that rescue and retail matters are currently being handled. The allocation of rice for retail in the Public Concession and the French Concession has been implemented in order. However, there are a large number of refugees in the Nanshi refugee area, and there are still households living there. Whether this method is also applicable will be discussed with the authorities. If permission is granted, it is also planned to establish a system to popularize it. Finally, the committee members discussed various proper methods for the allocation of retail, and then dispersed. Of the 500 registered rice shops, more than 400 have completed the payment and rice collection procedures. There are still more than 30 that have not completed it. It is heard that the association has notified the more than 30 stores to go to the association to collect the application forms before 9:00 AM on the 22nd (today) and go to the Bank of China at 276 Sichuan Road to pay off the payment so that the shipment can be unloaded and distributed to the stores as soon as it arrives. It is also heard that the Bank of China's collection time is limited to 11:00 AM on the 22nd.

### Foreign Ships Resuming Navigation to Shanghai and Hong Kong One After Another

Wharf Damage Makes Stopping Difficult　Regular Postal Ships Not Fully Opened　A Total of Seven Lines Have Been Scheduled to Open

The foreign shipping companies in Shanghai, due to the outbreak of the Songhu War, most of the sailors on the ships were unwilling to risk going to Shanghai. If they sailed to Wusong, the crew and sailors had to ask the ship owners to increase their wages three times. As a result, the foreign merchant ships stopped sailing to Shanghai one after another. Recently, with the war front moving west, a large fleet of enemy ships outside the Wusongkou, led by the Nagato and Asahi ships, have successively opened to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. More than 70 ships have sailed in, roughly attempting to break through our Jiangyin blockade line and conspiring to attack Nanjing by land and water. The Wusongkou is becoming quiet. Therefore, the British and German foreign shipping companies are planning to resume the Shanghai route. In recent days, the British Company's Sudan ship, Jardine Matheson's Green ship, Blue Funnel Line's passenger ship Sarpedon, Jardine Matheson's Tai Yin ship, and North German Company's Saar ship have all arrived in Shanghai one after another. Currently, the foreign ships that have already opened to navigation in Shanghai include: ㊀ French postal ship on the Sino-French line, one ship every two weeks; ㊁ Italian postal ship on the Sino-Italian line, one ship every four weeks; ㊂ British Company cargo ship on the Sino-European line, one ship every four weeks; ㊃ Blue Funnel Line passenger and cargo ships on the Sino-European line, each sailing once a month; ㊄ Jardine Matheson's Green ship on the Sino-European line, sailing once a month; ㊅ British ship on the Sino-Australian line, sailing once a month; ㊆ Tianxiang ship on the Sino-American New York line, sailing once a month. As for the ships that have not yet resumed service, there are the Pacific Shipping Company's President Dollar, Changxing Imperial Ship, and British regular postal ship, and North German's express ship. The reason why they have not resumed navigation is not because of fear of war, but because the major wharves and warehouses from Yangshupu to Waibaidu Bridge were destroyed in the war and are currently temporarily controlled by the enemy, making it difficult to dock for a while. (In the past, most of the postal ships docked at China Merchants Bureau's Zhongzhan, Beizhan, and Gonghexiang wharves, but now they have all been destroyed. Dalae's Nichiren Kyodo wharf is still unable to berth large ships.) Therefore, the resumption of regular postal ships still has to wait. It is heard that Changxing's Fu Hou ship plans to come to Shanghai in January next year. The President Dollar ship has not yet had news of opening to Shanghai.

### The German Ping Steamer Stopped Sailing to Tongzhou and Will Open to Ningbo Today

Ningbo Replied Electrically to Approve the Resumption of Navigation　Passengers Going to Tongzhou Changed to Taking Ende

The German Ping steamer of the Italian merchant China-Italy Company, because the military authorities in Ningbo have responded to the request of the Ningbo fellow villagers association in Shanghai and approved the resumption of the German Ping steamer, so as to facilitate the travel of travelers. Therefore, the proposal to sail to Tongzhou has been cancelled, and it will open to Yong on the 22nd, as follows:

Current Status of the Zhenhai Blockade

Since the interruption of land transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang, it has been maintained by the waterway between Shanghai and Ningbo with difficulty. Therefore, the continuation of this line is not only convenient for the people of Yong, but also for the people of Yong. However, since Zhenhai Coast was shelled by enemy ships on the 5th of this month, and Ningbo was wantonly bombed by enemy planes on the 12th, the local military authorities have increased fortifications in the already blockaded Zhenhai Estuary, and the traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo has also been interrupted. The German Ping steamer has been stranded in Shanghai again and again and cannot open.

Original Text of Ningbo's Reply

The Ningbo fellow villagers association in Shanghai, in view of the obstructed traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang, the Shanghai-Ningbo route relies on the Ningbo authorities' efforts to maintain it, so as to ensure the safety of travelers. At the same time, fellow villagers from Yong residing in Shanghai have also asked the association to forward a letter to the Yong authorities to change the handling. After the association repeatedly telegraphed the responsible parties in Ningbo, it was only yesterday that it received a reply from Ningbo, saying that it had discussed it with Commander Wang, County Chief Chen, and Police Chief Yu, and agreed to resume it three days later. After receiving the telegram, the association immediately notified the China-Italy Company.

German Ping Opens to Yong Today

After receiving the news, the company originally scheduled the German Ping steamer to be diverted to Tongzhou yesterday (21st). After deliberation, it was decided that the company had already dispatched the Ende steamer on the Tongzhou line. At the same time, a large number of passengers who had purchased tickets to Yong did not want to refund them. Therefore, it was decided to cancel the proposal to divert to Tongzhou and advance the German Ping steamer from Shanghai to Yong on the 22nd. The official announcement is as follows: "The German Ping steamer will depart from the Jinliyuan Wharf at 3:00 PM on Monday, November 22nd, to Ningbo." As for those who have purchased tickets to Tongzhou yesterday, they will be transferred to the next Ende steamer to Tongzhou.

### Fire in Nanshi Still Raging

Fear of Spreading to the Refugee Area

The fire in Nanshi reignited again at 1:00 PM on the 21st, causing flames to fill the sky and spread in all directions within the area, burning for several days and nights. According to reporter investigation, the houses burned in Nanshi District in the past few days include those in Laoximen, Dadongmen, Linyin Road, Daji Road, Dananmen, Xiaodongmen, Gaochang Temple, Wenmiao Road, and more than ten places in Dalin Road. In addition, the fire on Zhonghua Road and near the police station is even more intense. As of last night, it was still spreading. If no measures are taken to extinguish it, it will inevitably spread to the houses in the refugee area.

### Gunshots at Midnight

No One Injured　But the Source of the Gunshots is Unknown

The North-China Daily News reported that a few minutes before midnight yesterday (20th), rifle shots were heard in the central area of the Public Concession.

### Continued Fundraising for National Salvation Bonds

Kui Yanfang Raised More Than 20,000　National Medical Association Reached 30,000

Since the Second Special District Group of the Shanghai Citizen Fundraising Team for National Salvation Bonds started fundraising, thanks to the efforts of the team leaders, the results have been quite impressive. Recently, Mr. Kui Yanfang, the deputy director of the group, raised another 25,000 yuan. Other team members also reported many achievements. It is heard that the group is still continuing to carry out fundraising work. Since the National Medical Association established a National Salvation Bonds fundraising team, it has been actively carrying out fundraising work. Until recently, the amount of subscriptions from its members has reached more than 30,000 yuan. In order to step up the promotion, the association has now expanded the fundraising to fulfill its duties. In addition, the association had previously handled the registration and certification of national doctors with the Health Bureau, which has now been suspended.

### Losses of Factories in Shanghai

Totaling More Than 800 Million Yuan　Nanshi District Not Yet Included

The New Voice Agency reported that after the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry to investigate the losses of destroyed factories in Shanghai in detail and estimate the amount, in addition to announcing the deadline for the destroyed factories to report, it also telegraphed the estimated losses of the destroyed factories. The New Voice Agency reporter learned from the bureau yesterday that the Ministry of Industry was telegraphed at that time that there were 2,998 destroyed factories, with losses of 564,535,297 yuan. The total number of factories, according to statistics before the war, was 5,255. The estimated losses were 30% in Nanshi, 100% in Zhabei, 70% in Special District 1, and 50% in the four suburbs. Special District 2 had none. When the report was submitted, our army had not yet withdrawn from Nanshi, and most of the factories in the district were intact. Now that Nanshi has become a war zone, and the factories at Rihui Bridge and Gaochang Temple, where factories are lined up, have all become scorched earth, it should be calculated at 100% according to the current estimate. Moreover, there are 2,272 factories in the district, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total amount. Therefore, the estimated losses of factories in Shanghai should be more than 800 million yuan in national currency.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government for Fuel Assistance

Shortage of Charcoal　Must Rely on Assistance

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, for the purpose of relieving the Shanghai fuel situation, telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, saying, "To the Hangzhou Zhejiang Provincial Government: Shanghai is extremely short of charcoal and must rely on Zhejiang Province for assistance. There are now firewood and charcoal firms such as Maoxing, Xieshunxiang, Xincheng, Sentai, Lianda, and Chitae, who plan to ask Wenzhou charcoal merchants to transport and assist. We hope that your government will telegraph the Yongjia County Government to allow it to pass as usual, so as to maintain the fuel supply in Shanghai. We look forward to your reply. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully."

### Flour Prices Rise Due to Urgent Need

500,000 Bags Still in Stock　Price Up 10 Cents from Last Week

Since the sudden change in the situation in Shanghai, food and fuel, as daily necessities for the people, have been cut off at the source, and supply and demand have not been met. Although the concession authorities have tried their best to find a way, the panic has not been reduced slightly. There are restrictions on the purchase of rice, so citizens have switched to buying flour to satisfy their hunger. In the past half month, the flour on the market has been gradually sold. According to current statistics, there are still 500,000 bags in stock, and the price is 4 yuan and 15 cents per bag, which is 10 cents higher than a week ago.

### Nan Cheng Da Secretly Hiding Rice Confiscated

On the One Hand, Showing a Slight Punishment　On the Other Hand, Helping Refugees

After the Nanshi Defense Army was ordered to move west, the food supply in the concession suddenly became scarce, and the poor were panic-stricken. Thousands of people stood at the gates of various rice shops, but they could not get even a liter or a pint of rice to take home. Who would not be saddened by this situation? Who knew that there were still a few profiteering merchants who secretly hid and sold white rice at high prices, creating shortages. A few days ago, Nan Cheng Da Rice Shop at the intersection of Niaolang Road in the French Concession hid dozens of bags of white rice and did not sell it. Whenever poor residents went to buy rice, they would sell a large batch of broken rice that they had accumulated at ordinary times on the market. It is heard that it was sold for 8 yuan per dan, but there were many bad grains in this broken rice, so it could only be used to cook porridge and could not be used to cook rice. As a result, those who bought broken rice complained incessantly. This matter was discovered by the Lu Jia Wan Chief Patrol Room, which sent investigators to investigate. More than ten bags of white rice were found in the rice shop and taken back to the patrol room. The patrol head thought that this matter was greatly related to public order, so he specially used the rice as food for the relief of refugees, showing a slight punishment. The general poor people all praised it.

### Dr. Niu Huilin's Funeral Today

Following Christian Rites　Held at 3:00 PM

After the death of Dr. Niu Huilin, celebrities from China and abroad expressed their condolences and offered funeral gifts. His wife, Ms. Niu Liu Yiji, led her sons and daughters, Enan, Enjian, Ende, and Enmei, to accompany the spirit and grieve as much as possible. Niu's remains, surrounded by wreaths, had been made up by a technician from the International Funeral Home. Although his face was lifelike, the famous doctor of a generation had become a historical figure. His wife and children cried and could not bear to look at him. The coffin and other items were simple in accordance with his will. All ceremonies followed Christian rules. At 2:00 PM today, a pastor will lead a funeral service in front of the coffin. The funeral will be held at 3:00 PM. Niu had extensive social connections in China and abroad during his lifetime, and there must be many relatives and friends holding the ropes at that time. The Public Concession has specially issued a permit allowing passage through the roads he passed, but there are no traditional customs such as ceremonial guards and roadside sacrifices. According to those who know the Niu family well, the Niu family has suffered repeated misfortunes and their assets have been exhausted. The famous and reputable doctor died in poverty, which is truly regrettable.

### High Tides in the Huangpu River for Several Consecutive Days

Unprecedented in Winter　Tide Was the Greatest on the 19th

High tides in the Huangpu River are usually the worst in autumn, and lower in winter than in autumn. Unexpectedly, this year it has suddenly changed. Now it is the lunar October season, and the tides have been rising for several consecutive days, even exceeding the amount in autumn. Especially the tide on the afternoon of the 19th reached more than 13 feet, causing many riverbanks to be flooded. The warehouses were also caught off guard due to the unexpected event, and the goods were soaked in water. The sugar bags piled up on the ground floor of the Wylie & Han Company's warehouse at 53 Sima Road have been obviously affected by the water, so the company has notified the cargo owners to go to inspect and retrieve them.

### Ministry of Industry Explains the Nature of Soybean from Eastern Provinces

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously had doubts regarding the issuance of certificates for soybeans and soybean oil from the three eastern provinces, and telegraphed the Ministry of Industry for clarification. On the 19th of this month, they received a reply from the Ministry of Industry stating: "Your telegram received. Soybeans and soybean oil, etc., produced in the eastern provinces and imported through various ports, which are only subject to transit duties, should naturally not be considered foreign goods. Please be informed." Ministry of Industry Seal.

### Over Thirty Customs Vessels on the Huangpu River Were All Seized Yesterday

The Water Police Department of the Jianghai Customs and the Dredging Bureau's Smuggling Patrol Boats and Fireboats Were All Seized

Central News Agency reports: Over thirty large and small customs vessels belonging to the Jianghai Customs, the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau, and the Water Police Department, docked south of the Jianghai Customs wharf on Bund, Hankow Road, were all seized by enemy forces yesterday. Upon hearing the news, Customs Commissioner R.L. Forster immediately lodged a protest with the Japanese side. According to reporters, seventy to eighty enemy sailors, aboard several speedboats, arrived at the location at 2:30 PM, and after mooring, armed, boarded each vessel, monitoring all crew members and forbidding them from leaving. At the time, the crew members were caught off guard, so apart from a few who took the opportunity to escape, most were detained on board. The enemy soldiers then hoisted the rising sun flag on each vessel and ordered them to raise steam and set sail. By evening, most had sailed away. Apart from a few docked next to the enemy warship "Izumo," the majority were docked at Wayside Wharf. Only the Haiguang and Liuxing remained at the original location, unable to sail away. After the incident, reporters went to investigate and saw enemy soldiers standing armed on the ships. The situation was quite tense, causing pedestrians to disappear from the streets. Only crew members who had escaped could be seen hurrying back and forth. The seized customs vessels and small boats are all vessels used for smuggling patrol on the Huangpu River. Among them, Puji and another vessel were the only fireboats in the Huangpu River and were also seized. If a fire breaks out in the Huangpu River in the future, it will be impossible to put it out, so its impact on international safety is particularly significant. After these two seizures, all of the Jianghai Customs vessels have been taken, making it difficult to carry out its work. With the disappearance of patrol boats on the Huangpu River, pirates will run rampant without any security.

### 300,000 Refugees Weeping from Hunger and Cold, Like Living in Hell

Fuel and Supplies Are Exhausted, Urgently Awaiting Donations from All Sectors, 100 Refugees Sent to Tongzhou

Because of the continuous rainy days in the city, the weather has suddenly turned cold. Reporters visited the heads of various relief organizations yesterday morning and learned that the city's 300,000 refugees are all trapped in hunger and cold. Only about 50% of the poor refugees have received clothing and bedding, and food supplies have been exhausted due to the changing situation in Shanghai and the lack of assistance. Therefore, most refugees in the shelters are weeping from hunger and cold, like living in hell. Although a batch of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai, it has not yet been distributed. At this difficult time, various relief organizations are imploring people from all walks of life to extend their compassion, generously donate, and enthusiastically contribute to save these disaster victims. According to the International Relief Committee, the refugee area in the Nanshi area urgently needs donations of temporary food items such as guangbing (crisp pancakes), steamed buns, bread, and large flatbreads. If there are large donations, please contact the committee in advance. In addition, items such as cotton quilts, clothing, fuel, mast lights, canvas beds, toilet paper, large public buckets, chamber pots, and sanitary medicines are also in great need. Please send these donations to the committee on the third floor of the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge or to the committee's third shelter at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Luson. Also, yesterday morning, when reporters went to the United Relief Association of Charity and Youth Groups, all the staff were busy moving cotton clothes to the shelters. However, according to the person in charge, they are struggling to distribute the cotton quilts and clothes, and the amount is still large. At the same time, fuel and food are also facing difficulties. They hope that all sectors will provide assistance quickly, or the association can purchase them at a price.

Difficulties with Supplies, Striving to Disperse

Due to the changing war situation, traffic between Shanghai and the mainland has been disrupted, making dispersal work more difficult. Although refugees in Shanghai have been continuously sent away, there are still 300,000 people. The issue of supplies will inevitably arise, and appropriate methods are being discussed to resolve it. At the same time, foreign shipping companies are being commissioned to arrange for repatriation. It has been learned that the Shanghai Charity Relief Association sent 100-odd people yesterday, who were transported to Tongzhou by the TaiKoo company's Wuxue ship, and then transferred to various places.

Soliciting Winter Clothing to Aid Refugees

The weather has turned cold in recent days, and most refugees still lack winter clothing, suffering from both cold and hunger, a pitiful situation. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate cotton clothing and bedding to be distributed to the refugees. Items can be delivered to the YMCA International Relief Association for collection.

Jiangxi Refugees Still Awaiting Rescue

The Shanghai Jiangxi Compatriot Friendship Association has requested the Jiangxi Compatriot Association to continue repatriating and rescuing the many fellow refugees stranded in Shanghai.

We would like to request your association to quickly continue the rescue efforts from the remaining funds allocated by the provincial government to alleviate the suffering of fellow refugees who are displaced and homeless."

### Sheltering Lane Refugees

Reaching 1,000 People, Continuing to Issue Supply Tickets

The Shanghai Charity Relief Association, noting that there are still many refugees from the French Concession wandering the streets and alleys, and that the continuous rainy days have left the refugees like chickens in a soup, in a miserable state that cannot be described, and that they are prone to infectious diseases, which is also a major obstacle to hygiene, the association's deputy director of the shelter group, Lu Deshen, led all the staff to go to various roads to shelter and transport refugees to various shelters for the past two days, reaching more than two thousand people. However, they feel that the days ahead are long, and the number of refugees is increasing sharply, making supplies difficult. They hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate to save those who are in dire straits.

The Shanghai Xilianyi Association received donations from all walks of life yesterday, including 8,300 large pancakes and steamed buns from colleagues at Shenxin No. 9 Factory, 3,100 from Mr. Tong, 2,800 from Mr. Liu Yongxu, 1,000 from Ruida Lumber Company, and 71 pieces of old clothes and shoes from Mr. Xian. Mr. Sun of the Fu Hua Silk Weaving Factory donated 10 cotton wadding rolls. After the association distributed them, they were distributed to refugees in various districts. The association's relief group issued supply tickets to civilians, entirely for the convenience of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. Refugees can use the tickets to collect 1 food item from the association. Currently, each ticket is temporarily worth 2 jiao (cents) in national currency for food. If people from all walks of life donate food and send it to the association to exchange for supply tickets, they can distribute them themselves. The association will issue official receipts for all items received, but will never send staff to solicit donations outside. For those who entrust the association to help refugees, please contact them by phone at 25627, or send donations to the association at Chengde Fang, Gordon Road.

### Jiaotong University Refugees Managed by the Salvation Army

The Continental News reports: Jiaotong University in Xujiahui is sheltering 15,500 refugees and has been maintained by the Municipal Council. However, due to the Municipal Council's recent busy schedule, it has transferred the management of the site to the Salvation Army on Friday of last week. The Salvation Army has been working tirelessly on various tasks for three months since the start of the Sino-Japanese War. Now that it has taken on this heavy task, its enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable. Since taking over the site, the army has greatly improved the affairs within the site, and the refugees are quite happy to be in it. Many refugees are very frightened because they did not bring cotton clothes with them and winter is approaching. Fortunately, the Straits Settlements Chinese have donated 300,000 pieces of clothing, which have been allocated to the army by the International Red Cross for distribution to refugees in various shelters. Each refugee in the shelter will receive five pieces of clothing, which will be enough to keep them warm.

### Auction of Relief Donations

### Pushan Villa Burial Work

More Than 17,000 Male and Female Corpses, Change of Burial Ground Due to the Change in Shanghai's War Situation

The Shanghai Pushan Villa has been handling funerals for many years and has achieved remarkable results. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War this year, the burial work has become more and more burdensome. All the soldiers and civilians who died in the British and French Concessions, Nanshi, Huxi, Hongkou, and the war zone were sent by the villa to send burial teams to collect and bury them. It is estimated that from August 13 to November 15, a total of 1,238 officers and soldiers, 142 refugees, and 23 children who sacrificed their lives in the Red Cross's various rescue hospitals and special hospitals were buried.

This work was all assisted and cooperated by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the Chinese Red Cross, and the Shanghai Relief Committee. The villa's tomb was originally in the Dabao Beiyi area, but after it became a war zone, it was changed to be buried in the Nanshi and Hongqiao tombs. However, due to the recent changes in the situation in Shanghai, the traffic was blocked, and the villa tried its best to find a safe area in the Huxi Special Zone to be opened as a temporary tomb. Because the handling was fast, the villa's collection of corpses was not interrupted for a day. It is reported that the villa has agreed to the request of the International Red Cross to take on the task of collecting and burying the accumulated corpses in the Nanshi refugee area, and has contacted the French Police Department a few days ago to start the process. Also, residents of the Concession who encounter deaths and have nowhere to bury them can also prepare official letters and request the villa to temporarily bury them. After the situation is calm in the future, they can still be claimed and buried by themselves.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Changes in the Battle Situation on the Sujia Line

— Yi

The recent battles on the Jiangzhe Defense Line have seen significant changes. The enemy, due to the addition of tens of thousands of reinforcements, has been able to aggressively invade the Gangwen area. Our important points of Suzhou and Jiaxing have finally been abandoned with a heavy heart due to strategic considerations. What we now hope for is that our troops can maintain a long-term defense on the Jiangyin-Wuxing line. At the same time, we can make maximum use of guerrilla tactics to wear down the enemy's strength. This way, the capital's position can be consolidated.

Our military authorities are extremely determined to defend the capital. The relocation of the National Government to Chongqing in the west, while leaving all military organs behind, is a clear demonstration of this. The Spanish Republican Army successfully defended Madrid in a similar way. May our capital have the same glory as Madrid.

Of course, Nanjing and Madrid have very different terrains. Perhaps we may not be able to defend it as long as Madrid. But since our country has not fallen into the same state of disintegration as Spain, and the impact of this war against Japan on world peace is far greater than that of the Spanish Civil War, the future of our resistance war is actually brighter than that of Spain. As long as we can sustain the defense of the capital for two or three months, the favorable situation on the international and domestic fronts will definitely become clear.

The National Government's move to Chongqing expresses its determination to rather be a shattered jade than a complete tile, and declares that it will engage in a larger-scale and more sustained battle thereafter. We believe that the capital can certainly be defended for a considerable period of time. Even if it is unfortunately lost one day, the future of the resistance war is by no means pessimistic.

### Refugee District Representatives Shen Xinfu and Others Request Expansion of the Refugee District

Large Number of People But Small Area, Still Sleeping on the Streets in Wind, Cold, and Rain, Food Supplies Exhausted and Urgently Awaiting Assistance

After the outbreak of the great war in the city, since Father Jacquinot contacted various relevant parties and designated the area between Minguo Road and Fangbang Road in Nanshi as a refugee area, the fellow refugees from Pudong Nanshi who survived the artillery fire, were displaced and gathered here. Including the businesses that originally existed in the area that had not been evacuated, there are a total of more than 200,000 people. Fortunately, Father Jacquinot, the International Relief Committee, and the French Concession authorities have made every effort to shelter them and maintain the security of the area. However, the number of people is large and the area is small. In this cold wind and rain, many are still sleeping on the streets. They hope to expand the area and obtain a roof over their heads to prolong their lives. The larger shops in the area specially discussed and dispatched several people, including Shen Xinfu, the standing committee member of the business association in the area, and executive and supervisory committee members, to visit those who are concerned: ㊀ Please find a way to expand the refugee area to Zhaojia Road. ㊁ Please move the sandbags, barbed wire, and other items that are no longer suitable for use in Nanshi and set them up around the refugee area, and set up import and export ports. In addition to the refugees from the shelters and the merchants with certificates from the business association, other people will be inspected or refused entry. ㊂ Please ask the French Concession authorities to open the iron gates opposite Dajing Road and Xiaodongmen for several hours a day or issue a certain number of passes to facilitate the entry and exit of goods from the stores in the area (but the goods are limited to oil, salt, firewood, rice, etc.). ㊃ Select a number of representatives of pure merchants who have lived in the area for more than three years to assist the International Relief Committee in handling sanitation, food, and discipline matters. ㊄ Set up a registration office for people who are lost in the war zone.

Father Jacquinot of the Nanshi Refugee Office telephoned the Shanghai Xilianyi Association yesterday, stating that there were no less than 200,000 refugees in the area, with huge supplies, and the food had been exhausted. After checking the inventory, it was only enough for two days. If assistance is not provided quickly, the tragedy of food shortages and hunger will inevitably be repeated. Therefore, he asked the association to quickly raise funds and provide a large amount of food to avoid interruption and panic. After the association learned about the situation, in addition to immediately sending a large number of food items donated by various sectors to the International Relief Committee for distribution to provide assistance, it also regarded the matter as a serious military matter. How to properly coordinate the refugee supplies in the future is a problem. It is necessary to expand the fundraising, make persistent efforts, and appeal to all sectors to donate. Therefore, the association issued another notice, calling on all sectors to enthusiastically donate food to prevent the more than 200,000 refugees in dire straits from falling into despair. Please call the association at 35627 to notify the association to send someone to collect it. Saving the dead and bringing the flesh back to the bones is truly a immeasurable merit.

### Correction

The Shanghai News Agency apologizes for the error in the Jilin West Newspaper's general discussion of the city's refugee problem, in which the phrase "If you want to seek the restoration of Shanghai's industry, the authorities should make the skilled workers difficult to stay in Shanghai for a long time." The "局" (bureau) character was a "勿" (do not) character, and there was a great difference in text, we have make this special correction.
