### Our Entire Line Launches a General Offensive, Achieving Great Victories and Recapturing Over Thirty Important Positions

Advancing an average of one kilometer north and south along the Guangfu Line. The enemy around Gejia Pailou is routed. Enemy forces in the Jiangwan area retreat to the city center.

At 8 PM the night before last, our army launched a general offensive across the entire front. Soldiers in all directions, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, advanced towards their designated targets. The intensity of the situation was unprecedented since the "August 13th" incident. Our loyal and brave soldiers, braving artillery fire, fought fiercely, making progress in all directions, recapturing many important strongholds, and eliminating countless enemies. Although the enemy counterattacked yesterday, they ultimately failed. The situation in each direction is recorded separately below: ㊀ From the Chenjiaxiang to Shixianggong Temple line, our army won a great victory, recovering more than ten important strongholds such as the north and south of Xinmu Bridge and the Mei Residence. Yesterday, the enemy attempted a counterattack, but was defeated and routed by our forces. We are now strengthening fortifications and planning further advances. ㊁ South of the Wenzaobang Canal and west of the highway, at about 4 AM yesterday, we recovered positions such as Gejia Pailou and Huanggang south of Cuntang. Our forward posts advanced to the line of Fengcuntang and destroyed three enemy tanks. Yesterday morning, the enemy launched fierce air and artillery bombardments, covering infantry counterattacks. With no defenses to rely on, we temporarily retreated to Huzhaizhai, Sujiazhai, and Chenjiazhai, awaiting an opportunity to attack again. We once approached Heida Huangzhai, but the enemy used aircraft and artillery to stop our advance. Yesterday, there was fierce fighting at Yujiazhai. With fresh troops, we inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. ㊂ In the Jiangwan area, we successively recovered Tianlu Temple and Houjiazhai. ㊃ In the Zhabei area, our army repeatedly attacked Baziqiao, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. ㊄ The enemy in Yanjiawan made reckless moves, but were all repelled by our forces. When the enemy attacked Luzhai and Gaorenqiao, we calmly responded, and our positions remained unshaken.

A Central News Agency reporter embedded with the army in Zhabei reported at 1:30 AM on the 23rd that the advance of our army in the Jiangwan area after the surprise attacks on the enemy the night before last and yesterday morning exceeded expectations. The newly recovered strongholds have now been firmly maintained. No enemy traces were found around Ye Family Garden, Fudan University, and Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, suggesting that they have retreated to the city center. Furthermore, after Houjiazhai was recovered by our forces, enemy sentries dared to come forward all day. Enemy aircraft bombed the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas more fiercely yesterday than before, but our positions were not affected in the slightest. By night, Zhabei and Jiangwan were silent and uneventful.

A Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou on the 22nd quoted a forward reporter at 10 AM on the 22nd, reporting that on the night of the 21st, our army launched a general offensive. All soldiers were loyal and brave, fighting to the death with the enemy. At the same time, our artillery also concentrated fire, fiercely shelling the enemy. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated in disarray. As of dawn on the 22nd, as a result of our army's fierce fighting overnight, we had recovered more than thirty important positions, including Chenzhai, Yuzhai, Zhuzhai, Zhangjialou, Yangshuzhai, Dingjiaqiaozhai, Taoyuanbang, Shengjiazhai, Qiaotingzhai, Zhu Sanfang, Tangqiaotou, Shiqiao, Xinmuqiao, Xi Erfang, Nan Meizhai, Bei Meizhai, Xiaojiazhai, Wangjiawan, Nan Zhouqiao, Hua Zhouzhai, Wujiazhai, Yanzhai, Dingjiazhai, Lao Danzhai, Xin Danzhai, Chenzhai, Zhao Jiaqiao, Gaojia Long, Zhoujiacun, Shuangcaodun, etc. The enemy forces collapsed in a panic, suffering extremely heavy losses.

The following front-line battle report was received at 2 AM this morning: ㊀ After yesterday evening, our army resumed its fierce artillery attack on enemy positions in the Yanjiazhai and Fengcuntang areas. The intensity of the artillery fire was no less than the night before last. Huangjiazhai to Chenjiazhai area, Yanjiawan, Caijiazhai, Ziyangbang and other places were also the targets of our artillery. At the same time, our infantry also began a fierce sweep of the above-mentioned places. ㊁ Our army northeast of Dunwu Temple made contact with Bangnan last night.

### Our Army's Counteroffensive Brings Great Victory, with the Left Wing Advancing One Kilometer

Recapturing more than ten important strongholds. The enemy's full-scale counterattack yesterday was repelled. We are strengthening fortifications and planning further advances.

A Central News Agency reporter embedded with the army in Guangfu reported at 4 PM on the 22nd that the entire left wing from Chenjiaxiang to Shixianggong Temple had achieved a complete victory after our major counteroffensive and fierce fighting throughout the night. More than ten important strongholds, including Xinmuqiao, Nan Meizhai, and Bei Meizhai, have been recovered, and the entire front has advanced an average of one kilometer eastward. Only at Daizhai did the enemy put up a stubborn defense based on solid fortifications. Our army has surrounded them and will conquer them soon. Today (the 22nd), the enemy army again bombarded our entire front with aircraft and artillery, and the infantry also launched a full-scale counterattack. However, our army was in high spirits after the great victory. On the other hand, the enemy army, having been severely punished by us, had their morale dampened. Once our army launched an attack, they retreated in a panic. Therefore, we are still firmly defending the new positions and searching for remnants of the enemy, strengthening fortifications, and planning further advances.

Caowangmiao Sucun Line

A Central News Agency reporter embedded with the army in Guangfu reported at 10 AM that the enemy at the western end of Wuzhai was still dreaming when we attacked. Our army suddenly arrived and surrounded and annihilated dozens of enemies. Various documents were obtained from the enemy corpses and are being investigated. Along the Caowangmiao-Sucun line, our army also launched a surprise attack, and the enemy at Lao Danzhai, Xin Danzhai, Qin Jialong, Meng Jialong, Zhao Jiaqiao, and other places collapsed and retreated. Our army bravely pursued and captured many enemies. Bieshuqiao Station and Yangzhai south of the Liuhe River were all recovered by our forces. The remnants of the enemy fled to Houjiazhai, Chenzhai, and Wangzhai. In this battle, a total of several hundred officers and soldiers were killed or wounded between Guangfu and Liuhe, while the enemy's losses were several times higher than ours.

Chenjiaxiang to Guangfu

Our army has made considerable progress along the entire line from Chenjiaxiang to Guangfu. Our army launched attacks from Dunwu Temple, Lao Luzhai, Guangfu, Wuzhai, Zhangjiazhai, and Zhu Bei zhai, creating a formidable momentum. The enemy collapsed at the mere sight of us. Nan Meizhai, which is currently in front of Zhangjiazhai and Wuzhai, was the focus of the enemy's right wing. We attacked from both sides, and the enemy finally succumbed. We captured many of their guns and other equipment. Guangfu advanced more than a thousand meters. From Xinmuqiao to Xi Erfang and Lao Luzhai, our army recovered Tangqiaotou and then advanced north, joining forces with the troops at Xi Erfang to attack and conquer Shiqiao. Among them, Daizhai was defended by the enemy who refused to retreat and has been heavily surrounded by us. Northeast and northwest of Dunwu Temple, we have recovered Shengjiazhai, Qiaotingzhai, Zhu Sanfang, etc.

### Fengcuntang: We Still Hold Our Original Position

Our army once approached Heida Huangzhai. Fierce fighting took place at Yujiazhai all day yesterday. Three enemy tanks were destroyed at Yangwanzhai.

A Central News Agency reporter embedded with the army in Jiangwan reported at 9:30 PM on the 22nd that during our army's full-scale counteroffensive last night (the 21st), in the war zone south of the Wenzaobang Canal and west of the Liuhang-Dachang Highway, our army bravely charged enemy positions and advanced to the Fengcuntang line by about 4 AM this morning (the 22nd). By 9 AM, the enemy continuously bombarded our positions on that line, while simultaneously launching fierce bombardments with a large number of aircraft. Enemy infantry then advanced on us under the cover of heavy artillery and aircraft. Our army calmly responded, and the enemy failed. Until the afternoon, we retreated to the original position, as there were no fortifications to rely on, and flesh and blood could not fight against concentrated artillery fire and massive bombs. By night, we were still holding the line of Guohuzhai, Sujiazhai, and Chenjiazhai, waiting for an opportunity to attack again.

A Central News Agency reporter embedded with the army in Jiangwan reported at 9:30 PM on the 22nd that the earlier report about our army recovering Heida Huangzhai was inaccurate. Our army launched a surprise attack west of the highway last night, approaching Heida Huangzhai and posing a great threat to the enemy forces there. To relieve the siege, the enemy launched a full-scale counterattack today, bombing with aircraft and artillery to stop our advance. Therefore, there was fierce fighting at Yujiazhai all day. Our army, with its superior posture, inflicted serious damage on the invading enemy forces. As of the report, fierce fighting was still ongoing. There was also a small skirmish at Chenjiazhai, northeast of Yujiazhai. Our army held its ground and did not move.

A Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou on the 22nd stated that when we launched a full-scale attack on the night of the 21st, we encountered five enemy tanks near Yangwanzhai. Our commando team destroyed three of them with hand grenades, and the remaining two were also damaged and fled.

### Fierce Fighting Erupts Again in Bangnan: Our Army Fiercely Attacks Yanjiazhai

A Central News Agency reporter embedded with the army in Jiangwan reported at 1:30 AM on the 23rd that the fighting south of the Wenzaobang Canal had become more intense by night. In addition to the fierce fighting and mutual attacks in the Yanjiawan area east of the highway, our army west of the highway advanced from the Huangjiazhai-Chenjiazhai area, targeting Yanjiazhai and launching a fierce attack on the enemy. Both sides unleashed the most intense artillery fire, persisting relentlessly. The capture of Yanjiazhai is a key to recovering Heida Huangzhai and surrounding the enemy forces in Bangnan. As of the report, our army was in an advantageous position and advancing. Our army at Dunwu Temple in Bangbei has also established close contact with Bangnan, pressing forward to provide support.

A Central News Agency reporter embedded with the army in Jiangwan reported at 9:30 PM on the 22nd that the line of Luzhai and Gaorenqiaozhai east of the highway south of the Wenzaobang Canal has been one of the enemy army's key attack points for several days. The situation was particularly intense northwest of Gaorenqiaozhai, which was under enemy attack. Yesterday, the enemy attacked again several times, continuing into the evening, and fierce fighting was still ongoing. Our army responded calmly, and our positions remained unshaken.

### Jiangwan and Zhabei Achieve Consecutive Victories

Tianlu Temple and Houjiazhai Have Been Recovered Successively. Our Army's Attack on Baziqiao Inflicted Heavy Casualties on the Enemy

A Central News Agency reporter embedded with the army in Jiangwan reported at 1:30 PM on the 22nd: ㊀ At about 1 AM on the 22nd, our army in the Baziqiao area of Jiangwan launched a fierce attack on the enemy army southeast of Fudan University, immediately wiping out all the enemy's forward posts in that area. The enemy suffered more than fifty casualties. Since then, our Baziqiao position has become more and more consolidated. ㊁ At about 2 AM this morning, our army at Baziqiao launched another fierce attack on the enemy army in the Dongyaozhai area, inflicting heavy casualties on them. The enemy army in that area was completely unprepared. After our army arrived at the enemy's position, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy with hand grenades at a single command. In a panic, the enemy all ran into the nearby woods. Our army then launched a dense machine gun barrage, with bullets flying like a string of pearls, killing more than seventy enemies in total. By dawn, we retreated to our original position at Baziqiao. ㊂ At about 2 AM this morning, our army on the Chizhi University side also attacked Houjiazhai. Houjiazhai was originally our position, so our army was very familiar with the terrain there. We surrounded the enemy army in that area from three sides, annihilating more than eighty of them. After we recovered the area, we set up a warning line.

Further reports indicate that in Jiangwan, we recovered Tianlu Temple and attacked Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School from both the east and west gymnasium roads, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In Miaohang, we also advanced 200 meters east from Guo Caizhai, recovering the point of the Water God Temple. Many enemies were killed near Houjia Wooden Bridge, and many rifles were captured. At Chenjiazhai and Yujiazhai, the enemy resisted stubbornly, so the fighting was very fierce. A certain battalion commander of our army took the lead near Luzhai and was unfortunately seriously injured. Shenjiawanzhai was once broken through by the enemy, but it was recovered by our daredevils by midnight yesterday.

### Seven Hundred Boxes of Enemy Aircraft Parts Were Destroyed by Our Air Force

Enemy Was Unloading Munitions at the Huishan Wharf Last Night, Which Was Hit by Our Air Force, Sending Flames Soaring into the Sky

Our air force came to Shanghai to assist in the battle again at 6 PM yesterday. They flew over Shanghai again at 10 AM. At that time, the enemy army was unloading munitions at the Huishan Wharf. Our air force dropped a bomb, which directly hit the target. A loud explosion was heard, and flames soared into the sky. By midnight, the fire had not yet been extinguished, and the enemy's losses were extremely heavy.

On the night of the 20th of this month, when our planes came to Shanghai to attack the enemy's base in the eastern district of Shanghai, the enemy's Yufeng Cotton Mill in Yangshupu was indeed hit by two bombs dropped by our planes. It burned for about an hour before being extinguished. A total of three and a half workshops fully loaded with important munitions and weapons were burned down.

Our air force has repeatedly raided Shanghai at night, and the enemy's munitions have been destroyed to a very large extent. Among them, 700 boxes of aircraft parts that had just been transported to Shanghai were also hit and destroyed by our bombs. Currently, these damaged parts are stored in the Shi'en School on Pingliang Road and Ningguo Road. It is also known that the airfield built by the enemy in Yangshupu has been repeatedly raided by our army and shelled from Pudong. Another airfield has been opened near the Wusong Paotaiwan, and the heavy bombers that have been active in recent days have been flying out from there.

### Tragic Incident of Enemy Aircraft Dropping Bombs at the Intersection of Xinzha Road and Meibai Ge Road

The Scene of the Disaster Was Half a Mile South of the Suzhou River. More Than Forty Chinese and Foreigners Were Injured

For days, enemy aircraft have been wantonly bombing Zhabei and McGone Road, and even non-combat areas along the north bank of the Suzhou River have been threatened and destroyed. The cruelty and ruthlessness of the enemy army, arbitrarily slaughtering the innocent, is truly inhumane. Yesterday afternoon, three enemy aircraft went to Zhabei and McGone Road to carry out wanton bombing. Fearing that our air defense teams would shoot at them, they flew high at an altitude of 8,000 to 9,000 feet, dropping bombs at will. The south bank of the Suzhou River was also bombed. The tragic case of the McGone Road Changping Road had just passed, and at 4:15 PM yesterday, another tragic incident occurred at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Meibai Ge Road. The location is half a mile away from Zhabei. Although the enemy air force's bombing experience is immature, it should not be so far off the mark. Therefore, the enemy bomb was dropped on the south bank of the Suzhou River, which is worth studying. The bomb was a sulfur incendiary bomb. When it was dropped, it fell in the center of the road at a time when pedestrians and traffic were busy. It exploded immediately, and iron pieces and flames flew everywhere. Therefore, pedestrians, shops, and peddlers around the intersection were burned. Flames rose immediately, and the scene was full of people with scorched heads and faces. Six rickshaws were burned on the spot, and the passengers and drivers were also burned. The doors and windows of nearby shops also caught fire and burned at the same time, and the order was chaotic, and traffic was completely blocked. For a while, ashes and fresh blood stained the ground, and the road turned into a bloody road. Fortunately, the Xinzha police station, the Chinese Red Cross rescue team, and the Xinzha fire brigade were nearby. Within minutes of the accident, they immediately dispatched all personnel to rescue, extinguishing the fire and transporting the burned men and women to Renji and Baolong hospitals for treatment. The stains and debris along the road were also washed away and inspected and filed. Traffic was restored. A total of 43 people were injured, mostly in the head, hands, shoulders, and other parts. Those sent to Renji included Cha Heying, 35 years old, Fang Xucui, 25 years old, Wu Meimei, 5 years old, Wu Didi, 2 years old, Wu Baoshi, 37 years old, Wo Fengjiang, 24 years old, Chen Wushi, 43 years old, Tang Sandi, 24 years old, Cai Baiyu, 26 years old, Yang Yongqing, 20 years old, Qiu Jintian, 24 years old, Wang Changlan, 20 years old, Weng Shi, 32 years old, He Tingsheng, 27 years old, Yang Fanshan, 32 years old, Gu Xiyu, 53 years old, Zhou Gufi, 26 years old, Wu Aming, 23 years old, Shen Youcai, 30 years old, Hong Wuquan, 43 years old, and a Yang man, 35 years old. Those sent to Binlong included Zhang Jinhai, 35 years old, Zhu Huien, 25 years old, Zhou Hongtai, 43 years old, Mei Chang'an, 24 years old, Huang Hengyi, 36 years old, Jiang Shoubao, 36 years old, Gao Ashou, 20 years old, Luo Qirong, 50 years old, Yin Xiangzhu, 41 years old, Zhang Jiadong, 13 years old, Zhu Shaoying, 53 years old, Zhang Liubao, 14 years old, Shen Xueshi, 42 years old, Mei Lushi, 23 years old, Yuan Guoyou, 34 years old, and Liu Genbao, 30 years old. There were also six others who were slightly injured and discharged after bandaging. In addition, the Indian police officers No. 520 and 402 stationed there, and an American sailor were also burned and sent to Gongji and other hospitals for treatment.

### Enemy Aircraft Run Rampant

A Daily Occurrence

At 10 AM yesterday, two enemy aircraft circled over Pudong to reconnoiter. At 11 AM, they dropped two sulfur bombs on the Huachang Match Factory on Xinma Road and Sanguantang, which burned fiercely for a time and had not been extinguished by noon. At noon yesterday, two enemy aircraft flew to Tangqiao District, which has no military facilities, and dropped two incendiary bombs, causing many civilian houses to catch fire and spread.

Starting at 1 PM yesterday, three enemy aircraft wantonly bombed civilian houses at Yangjiazhai, Tiandu, Yangjiadu, Zhangjiabangnan Shou, etc. in Pudong, dropping more than 20 bombs and injuring more than a dozen innocent civilians. In the evening, they strafed pedestrians with machine guns on Xinma Road.

Starting at 10 AM yesterday morning, enemy invaders were active again in all directions. The following locations were bombed: ㊀ The intersection of Guangdong Street and the railway, ㊁ A section of the railway between Qiujiang Road and the Indian Temple on Baoshan Road, ㊂ An area north of Dachang to Liuhang, ㊃ Pengpu, ㊄ East of the Pudong Electric Company (about three-quarters of a mile from the company). The Zhabei Chinese Army fired anti-aircraft guns at the enemy aircraft. At about 10 AM, there was artillery fire within about one mile north of the McGone Road Station. A fire broke out at the intersection of Kerlen Road and the boundary road, and the Concession Fire Brigade dispatched A to put out the fire. A fire also broke out in Pudong. At about 1 PM, there was bombing between Dachang and Liuhang, at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and the railway line, near St. John's University, and near the Central Mint. Enemy aircraft also bombed Pudong, with the bombing location about half a mile from the Gonghexing Wharf. From 2 PM to 5 PM, enemy aircraft continued to bomb the Liuhang area and along the railway line north of the Lianglu Administration Building. At about 4 PM, enemy aircraft bombed Pudong (about two miles north of Beicai Town) and an area northwest of the McGone Road Station.

### Our Artillery Hits Enemy Warships

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy flagship "Izumo" has been attacked by us many times and now often uses small gunboats and transport ships to surround it as a guard. It is known that the night before last, when our Pudong artillery showed its great power, it used the "Izumo" warship as the target for bombardment. Several shells hit two of its escort transport ships, both of which were seriously damaged, and one of them was half-sunk in the water. At the same time, two sand barges were also completely destroyed by the bombing. The ships were carrying enemy troops, and casualties were heavy. At about 3 PM yesterday afternoon, an enemy destroyer anchored at the No. 7 buoy on the Huangpu River suddenly fired artillery shells at Pudong, firing a shell every three or five minutes and continuing the bombardment until about 4 PM, destroying many civilian houses, but causing no military damage to our army.

### Another Yangtze Warehouse Destroyed

Cotton in the Warehouse Completely Burned

The Yangtze Warehouse (ie the Cotton Industry Public Warehouse) on the eastern end of the Pudong Merchants' Huazhai, since the three riverside warehouses were bombed and burned, destroying warehouses Nos. 7 and 8, was set on fire again with open sulfur bombs the night before last, burning down the planned No. 4 warehouse. Thus, all three warehouses were reduced to ashes, resulting in a loss of approximately 450,000 gold. Not satisfied with the enemy warships, around 7 PM last night, they used flat-trajectory guns to bomb warehouses Nos. 3 and 5 at the back, dropping shells into the cotton piles and causing them to catch fire again. At about 9:30 PM, flames burst through the roof, and the fire soared into the sky. From a distance, one could see half the sky in red light. The fire was even fiercer than in Warehouse No. 4 the night before last. Moreover, the warehouse was located in the Pudong war zone, and the local fire brigade was unable to provide assistance. The fire continued to burn until noon today and has not yet been extinguished. The two warehouses stored about 1,000 bales of foreign cotton, which have already been reduced to ashes, resulting in another loss of 200,000 to 300,000 gold. As for the rumors that the Pudong Huatong Wharf caught fire last night, it was actually a mistake for the Yangtze Warehouse.

### Han Fuju Denies Rumors and Resolves to Resist to the End

Reiterating His Loyalty to the Party and the Nation, Hoping That the People of the Country Will Not Speculate Recklessly

[Jinan] Recently, there have been many rumors circulating outside of Shandong Province, such as that Japanese aircraft do not bomb Jinan, or that there is a tacit understanding, which have been spread from person to person, causing widespread suspicion. Yesterday, the reporter met with Han and asked about the truth. Han replied that the Japanese bandits' consistent means of controlling us is to sow discord, divide and conquer. This time, our national war of resistance has been launched, giving the invaders a serious blow. The Japanese bandits have no other choice but to create doubts and try to achieve their cunning plans. However, such tricks of ghosts and monsters are not worth the laughter of those who know. I am a soldier and have a responsibility to defend the country. At this critical moment for the survival of the nation, I swear to resist to the end under the guidance of the Central Government and the Supreme Military Leader, and I will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. This is not only a matter of conscience, but also a fact. As for the military aspect, the government has its own overall plan and cannot report it. However, I hope that the people of the country will broaden their horizons and not make reckless speculations. In short, facts speak louder than words, and rumors and slanders will be defeated without attack. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)

Various Organizations Join in the Charitable Effort, Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement Continues to Expand

[London] Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Union held a meeting yesterday to discuss methods of pressuring Japan. Some suggested that Japan imports an average of 3 million tons of kerosene annually, 75% of which is purchased from the United States, and 17% from the Dutch East Indies and British Borneo.

### Fierce Fighting in Northern Shanxi, Our Guancun Position Lost and Regained

Recapture of Jiuguan in Eastern Shanxi, Enemy Retreats East, Our Troops on the Pinghan Railway Advance to Matou Town, Intense Artillery Battles at Yucheng on the Jinpu Railway Yesterday

[Taiyuan] The battle in northern Shanxi faced a tense situation on the night of the 21st. The enemy troops on the Xin Kou front concentrated their forces at Xiawangzhuang and Gongjiazhuang on the afternoon of the 21st and launched a fierce attack on our Guancun (5 miles north of Xin Kou). Initially, they attempted to destroy our position using their heavy artillery, but our loyal and brave soldiers calmly responded. Waiting for the enemy infantry to charge, they immediately jumped out of the trenches and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Suffering excessive casualties, the enemy disregarded humanitarian principles and international law, using poison gas and incendiary bombs. Because our troops did not expect the enemy to use such despicable means, many did not carry gas masks, leading to significant sacrifices under the cloud of poison gas. The enemy seized the opportunity to attack and enter Guancun, occupying several high grounds. Our commanding officer urgently dispatched elite troops to reinforce and counterattack. After several intense battles, the original frontline position of Guancun was recaptured. On the morning of the 22nd, enemy and our forces were still confronting each other on this line. On the left and right flanks, because the enemy was concentrated on the frontal attack, our army did not launch attacks, so the battles on both flanks were quiet. According to a senior staff officer who had just arrived from the front on the evening of the 22nd, although the Xin Kou line was threatened by the enemy on the evening of the 21st, our army vowed to defend it, turning danger into safety.

### Enemy Troops in North China Flee to Outside the Pass

Total Reaches 40,000, Japan Plans to Form Puppet Organization

[Beiping] According to reliable sources in Tangshan today, many Japanese military vehicles, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, are winding continuously, heading from North China to outside the Pass.

Currently, there are still large numbers of troops withdrawing from the Pinghan Railway to Fengtai and Tianjin, or they may also be transferred to Manchuria. Some foreign observers believe that Japan has begun to consider adjusting the military situation in North China and plans to find a way to establish a puppet organization similar to an autonomous government before October 30, so that it can create an accomplished fact before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. As for Shandong, the situation is unclear. For the past ten days, the Japanese army has stopped advancing, which shows that the military position in Hebei Province urgently needs to be adjusted. It is reported that the Japanese side believes that 60,000 troops must be stationed in Hebei Province to cope.

### British Parliament Discusses Foreign Affairs, Chamber Full, No Empty Seats, British King Concerned About Sino-Japanese War

Deep Regret for the Slaughter of Many Innocent Civilians, Foreign Secretary Declares Determination to Promote Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Prime Minister Announces Policy to Do His Best to Save Lives

[London] The House of Commons reconvened at 3:00 PM today and immediately began debating foreign policy. The chamber and the gallery were extremely crowded. During Eden's speech, the audience applauded from time to time. Regarding the Far East situation, Foreign Secretary Eden said in his speech, "Today, everyone's wish is to stop the killings and suffering in China. If the upcoming Nine-Power Treaty Conference can achieve this goal, it would be the greatest contribution to peace and humanity. If it fails, we must consider a new situation. However, in our minds, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has the greatest hope of success, which I will not hesitate to say again. The British government is participating in this conference with the determination to do its best to promote its success." Regarding the conflict between China and Japan, regardless of the final victory or defeat, the result will only be to make both sides, and even all countries in the world, increasingly poor. (Central News Agency, 21st, Havas dispatch)

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke in the House of Commons today to conclude the debate, saying that we should not allow hypothetical events that have not yet occurred to influence our minds. Many lives are sacrificed every day in the Chinese war, so we should devote all our strength and cooperation to the work of preserving life. After the Prime Minister's speech, the House of Commons passed the government's motion to adjourn with 204 votes to 111. The Labour Party had already decided to vote against it as a protest against the British government's policies on Spain and the Far East. In the gallery, the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, Argentina, Belgium, Spain, and China listened quietly to the speech, paying close attention. After Labour leader Attlee and Liberal leader Sinclair spoke successively, Chamberlain stood up and said that the purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels is to strive to restore peace in the Far East. Attlee argued that the government should declare that it seeks peace by peaceful means, and if that is not possible, what actions will be taken. He did not dare to agree, because it is not advisable to talk about economic and military pressure in the conference. We go to the conference to seek peace, not to expand the conflict. The first thing we should do is to study jointly what methods can be used to promote a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese conflict. (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters dispatch)

[London] King George VI attended the House of Lords at 11:20 AM and delivered a decree to the members of both houses, which stated in the section on the Far East issue, "The conflict between China and Japan is developing increasingly, and I am deeply concerned by what I hear and see. I am particularly deeply saddened by the repeated attacks from the sky and sea on innocent non-combatants, which have caused frequent deaths and injuries. I now trust in the upcoming Nine-Power Treaty Conference and sincerely hope that it can turn hostility into friendship. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas dispatch)

### Labour Leader Ridicules the British Government for Only Focusing on Its Own Interests

And Must Not Allow Aggressors to Leave Half-Satisfied; Liberal Leader Advocates Economic Sanctions

[London] The House of Commons debated foreign policy today. The entire house was packed, and Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech. He was warmly welcomed for convening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to resolve the Sino-Japanese War. Among those listening in the visitors' gallery of the House of Commons were the ambassadors of China, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Argentina, Spain, and other countries. After Eden described the British government's efforts to mediate, he stated, "We sincerely welcome the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. We deeply believe that a meeting of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty in the capital will be the most hopeful way to resolve this unfortunate war. The paramount wish of everyone now is to stop the slaughter and turmoil we have witnessed in China as soon as possible. If the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can achieve success, then the conference has already fulfilled its greatest mission." The speaker following Eden was the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Attlee. He questioned whether the Nine-Power Treaty Conference would use the Nine-Power Treaty as the basis for discussion, or whether there would be another Hull-Ryder plan. Attlee stated that Foreign Secretary Eden's speech consistently indicated that the only thing that influenced the British government was the interests of British imperialism itself. However, what the Labour Party advocates is the rule of law among nations and the development of public welfare organizations among nations, while the government has regressed to a state before Europe, with only its own interests as its sole concern. The government has neglected the true path to safeguarding world peace, which should be sought within international institutions. Attlee further inquired whether the government's policy on the Sino-Japanese issue seemed to be to allow those seeking to seize the entire loaf of bread to only take half. Therefore, Attlee questioned Prime Minister Chamberlain whether he could provide a promise to guarantee no actions incompatible with the Nine-Power Treaty. He further inquired whether, if China accepted the terms of a truce and Japan blatantly disregarded them, the government would advocate international economic sanctions against Japan. Attlee believed that it was insufficient for the League of Nations to merely declare who the aggressor was, and more concrete measures must be taken. Attlee stated that he firmly believed that the reason Japan dared to defy the world was because the British and other governments allowed it to run rampant. However, Japan's economic position is extremely fragile. If Britain could apply one-tenth of the determination it showed in the Mediterranean to the Far East, then Japan's aggression against China could be stopped. Japan's premeditated aggression is a natural consequence of British policy after the country's invasion of Manchuria.

Sir Archibald Sinclair, representing the Liberal Party, continued by saying that President Roosevelt's important speech was the most hopeful statement since the European War, and the British side should give a more full response. He also said that if Japan's customers could refuse its goods at the last moment, then Japan would have no way to raise war funds. However, he also acknowledged that the British Empire has vulnerable points, such as Hong Kong, and would certainly be unwilling to join this boycott movement. Sinclair finally summarized his policy as follows: ㊀ Call for reconciliation and assure China and Japan that Britain understands the reasonable grievances of each country, and that these grievances, such as commercial discrimination, can be discussed and ways to remedy them can be sought. ㊁ If this reconciliation cannot be achieved, then it must be prepared for economic pressure with sufficient force so that it will have the effect it should have in the event of resistance.

In his speech, Foreign Secretary Eden began by saying, "Today, in two parts of the world, namely Europe and Asia, there are wars. The war in the Far East, regardless of the military outcome, will inevitably result in mutual damage. Britain deeply regrets this, not only because of the huge losses in British commerce in the Far East, but also because before the outbreak of the war, the British government had consultations with the Japanese government, hoping that it could cooperate with China for the sake of friendship and trade between the two countries. Unfortunately, this conversation was interrupted by the outbreak of war, and in the current state, this conversation is impossible to continue." Eden then briefly described the British government's efforts to mediate, saying that the British government had been in constant communication with other governments, especially the United States, in its efforts to mediate. The views of the various governments and the actions taken by the British government towards both China and Japan were essentially the same. Regarding the discussions of the League of Nations and the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels on the 30th of this month, it is hoped that the British representative can be announced soon. Eden further stated that the League of Nations has already made considerable statements regarding the outbreak of war and aerial bombing. In addition to declaring that the government recognizes every word reported and declared by the British representatives in Geneva, I do not wish to add more. Eden also recalled the circumstances under which the League of Nations Subcommittee recommended convening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying that the League of Nations' decision was extremely resolute, and that the British government is continuing to consult with other governments until the time of the meeting, and has received news that French Foreign Minister Delbos will attend in person, and the Italian government will also send representatives to participate, and the chief representative of the United States has decided to be Davis. "It would be unwise to announce in advance what will be discussed and what will not be discussed at the meeting. We have a fixed and unwavering direction given by the League of Nations. The proper path we should follow is to consult with the representatives of the countries attending the meeting and do our best to fulfill the mandate of the League of Nations. If the meeting fails, then we will inevitably enter a new environment that everyone should consider deeply." Eden concluded by saying, "The British government will go to the meeting with the determination to do its utmost to achieve success" (Central News Agency, 22nd, Reuters)

[London] The House of Lords met today to debate the international situation. Labour Party member Lord Snell spoke, only criticizing the barbarity of the war in the Far East, saying that both China and Japan will suffer economic hardship as a result, and the world will suffer serious economic losses, especially Britain and the United States. Economic pressure is the weapon currently being used, and it is difficult to expect the British government to move in this direction. However, the Labour Party and the trade unions will do their best to apply this pressure to Japan. Snell hoped that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference would be successful and suggested organizing an international committee based on the method of the Lytton Commission to seek a solution based on the principle of the open door. Then Lord Plymouth, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, spoke, mainly the same as Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons, saying that the government warmly welcomes the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and believes that it has the best hope of ending the Sino-Japanese War by peaceful means. As for inviting non-signatory countries or countries that have not recognized the treaty but have close ties with the Far East incident to participate, it is currently under consideration, but it will not be decided before the meeting. Lord Plymouth clearly stated that this meeting is not held under the support of the League of Nations, does not follow the procedures of the League of Nations, and is not bound by the League of Nations Covenant, but can completely freely explore any path that has hope of success. The main purpose of the meeting is to find a way for all parties to agree to restore peace. If the meeting fails, what will be the situation, it is not convenient to discuss now. He hoped that the meeting could be successful and deal with difficult work in an atmosphere of goodwill and cooperation.

Lord Crewe, representing the Liberal Party, then spoke, expressing dissatisfaction with Lord Plymouth's failure to mention the development of the moral indignation of the people of the world and the methods of punishing Japan. He also said, "Has the British government indicated that it will, together with other countries, especially the United States, implement economic pressure? This is what we want to hear."

Conservative Party member Lord Balfour then spoke, saying that a boycott of Japan will inevitably cause the initiators to suffer. Britain's main goal is to maintain friendly relations with China and Japan in order to seek peaceful development in East Asia. Lord Halifax, Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords, then spoke, clearly stating that Britain's main goal is to restore peace in the Far East. The government does not fail to consider economic and military interests. As for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, we do not want to place one side or the other in the position of the accused, but only to proceed in accordance with the spirit of Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty. We sincerely hope that Japan will participate in the meeting, but even if Japan does not participate, the participating countries can still work together and use great forces. We only hope that the meeting can proceed in the spirit of the League of Nations resolutions and implement various beneficial methods of peaceful persuasion and reconciliation. If the meeting unfortunately fails, none of the participating countries will give up their freedom of action. Lord Halifax concluded by saying that although this meeting was initiated by the League of Nations, it was not held under the auspices of the League of Nations. (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)

### British Trade with China Sees a Sharp Decline

Regarding the status of British trade in China, it is not yet possible to describe it in detail, but in the current situation, trade in mainland China in September has seen a sharp decline compared to August.

### Bishop Costantini Talks About the Current Situation of Preaching

Focus on Mutual Aid Undertakings

⊙ Vatican City The Vatican's Minister of Propagation, former Apostolic Delegate to China, Bishop Celso Costantini, recently gave a speech on "The Enemies of Christ and the Church," stating that the way to stop the propaganda of Bolshevism is to use preaching and missionary activities, as well as social mutual aid undertakings, as the best weapons. On the other hand, wherever Bolshevism goes, the common sense of the Chinese people can play its instinct, and the number of those who convert to Catholicism is unprecedented. Bishop Costantini also said that there are currently 1,100 native priests in China, who preside over 25 missionary organizations. There are currently 100 Japanese priests in Japan, who preside over two missionary organizations. There are currently 1,100 native priests in India, who preside over six missionary organizations.

### T.V. Soong Broadcasts to America Yesterday, Bitterly Discussing Economic Boycott

Learning from the Past, We Should Advocate Resolute Action Against Aggressor Nations; Only a United Front is Needed to Subdue the Violent

T.V. Soong, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, broadcasted to America yesterday (22nd). The original text stated: "To what extent the Sino-Japanese War affects your country is currently swirling in the minds of your people. Indeed, the Sino-Japanese War affects your country. Today, I am broadcasting in China, and you can listen to my speech in California, Ohio, New York, and Tennessee. This already indicates that in the past, it once belonged to Britain, and today, some of your people's illusions of America's isolation no longer exist. Our tribulations, whether your people care or not, are also your people's tribulations. When I studied in your country many years ago, I was a guest in many of your families. Today, I am very happy to have this opportunity to express my personal opinion on how the war in the Far East affects your lives.

China, like the United States, was previously a peace-loving country, and it still is today. We pray for peace, we hate war, we have no desire to win wars, we do not covet the wealth of our neighbors, and what we seek is to be allowed to strive to complete our typical way of life. Since we are a peace-loving country, we hope that other countries will allow us to maintain peace. However, the ancient saying that 'a war is caused by two countries' is a big mistake. I believe that peace must be maintained by both sides. You can remember the game of building a house with blocks when you were in Boy Scouts. You put in a lot of effort to build the house, and at this time, a crazy man comes and kicks it lightly, which can destroy the entire building. In the past few decades, our people have worked hard to build a modern democratic country, devote themselves to spiritual and material construction, promote public education and public health, build transportation networks, and develop rural factories and mineral resources. However, when the construction had just begun to take shape, the violent Japan, the world's number one public enemy, destroyed the results of our hard work. How can we save ourselves? Our people across the country are now rising up to fight back for life and freedom. In Shanghai alone, Japan is using all kinds of modern mechanized weapons, such as warships, tanks, heavy artillery, airplanes, and bombs, to bombard our soldiers, non-combatants, women, and children at will. We now have to sacrifice our youth to prevent the aggressor from destroying us. Some may ask what the responsibility of peace-loving America is. However, if someone were to bomb your hometown, how would you deal with it? Would you hide yourself and pray that you would not be attacked? I don't think so. Your peace should be more constructive. Indeed, you don't want to destroy peace, but if someone bombs your neighbor, you will organize a militia to support them, because you know very well that if your neighbor is in trouble today, it may happen to you tomorrow. At this point, allow me to briefly describe the history of the past. Once upon a time, there was a certain country that was strong at the time, with abundant national power, and could be fearless of any invasion from other countries. Later, a neighboring country was invaded by another country, and all treaties and alliances were torn up by the aggressor country. The certain country was one of the signatories of the treaty, but because it was bound by economic difficulties, it turned a blind eye. At that time, some people advocated urging the country to pay attention and take joint action to stop the aggressor's atrocities. However, they listened to sophistry, saying that the situation in the Far East had its peculiarities, and that there should be different international laws for Western Europe and the Far East. As a result, the aggressor country regarded international law as nothing, and the world fell into chaos. Various countries are now spending huge sums of money to increase their armaments. The reason why I am saying this today is because when the Manchurian Incident occurred in 1931, I was also one of the people in charge of our country's government. At that time, your Secretary of State Stimson did not avoid hardships and attempted to plan effective measures to stop the aggressor's atrocities. International banditry is contagious. People of America, do not think that taking a disinterested attitude and maintaining a so-called isolation policy can stay out of the matter and avoid the catastrophe. If your concept of peace is not supported by a solid and powerful backing, it is not enough to stop the disaster. When I talk about the dangers that America will encounter if Japan conquers China, you may think that what I am saying is about the distant future, but what I have in mind also includes the near future. The current situation in China is just like when you were a child and played the game of building imaginary houses with building blocks with other children, but were suddenly destroyed by a domineering child. At this time, you are working hard to get rid of economic decline, create new organizations, formulate new laws, conduct experiments, and constantly strive to improve the situation. You have made substantial progress, and your success is in sight. Your people have better food, clothing, and housing. At this time, the violent Japan came and stirred up the demons of war, threatening to overthrow your great plans for recovery. Your stock market has become weak, the prices of your products have fallen, and you are still talking about cotton at 7 cents and wheat at 70 cents. In fact, you have returned to a state of recession due to the panic of the world's second war. Your country's great domestic market and your country's good isolation of the coastline have not exempted you from feeling the harmful effects of the Japanese war in China. We have no right, and we do not ask you to get involved in the whirlpool of war to stop Japan's threat, but the power of constructive pacifism, if you only implement it, is greater than violence. Japan is a violent man, and the weak China has risen up to resist. Japan does not dare and cannot provoke the group of peace-loving countries. If you can sincerely cooperate with the peace-loving countries and implement resolute economic boycotts against aggressor countries, peace can be achieved. You only need to show a united front, and the violent can be subdued. In this way, you can save the world and yourselves from the rioters who threaten to destroy modern civilization.

### The Third Hospital of the Red Cross Benefits Civilians

The Third Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross was formerly located at Shiliupu in Nanshi. After the outbreak of the August 13th War of Resistance, it moved to No. 1 Sichuan Road and formed the Seventh Rescue Hospital, which was presided over by Lu Shoubai and Zhang Zhenyan. In addition to the original medical staff, well-known doctors also participated voluntarily. A part of the nurses from the Bethel Nursing School joined, and there were also volunteer staff who enthusiastically helped with the work. Although it was a short time, the hospital admitted and treated hundreds of wounded soldiers, which showed its remarkable effectiveness. Later, the Red Cross General Association considered that there was a lack of places for the wounded and sick civilians to receive medical treatment, so it ordered the Seventh Rescue Hospital to be closed and the Third Hospital to be restored to provide hospitalization and treatment for injured and sick civilians to benefit the poor. The hospital is located at No. 1 Sichuan Road and is still presided over by Dean Wang Yiting and Vice Deans Lu Shoubai and Zhang Zhenyan. There are six doctors and many nurses in the hospital. The equipment is still adequate and can accommodate more than 100 patients. It is truly the gospel of the civilians.

### Zhang Zhixue Raises Clothes and Bandages to Help Wounded Soldiers

Ms. Zhang Zhixue of the Shanghai YWCA has been enthusiastic about running around for various donations since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, and has spared no effort. Recently, she has raised 100 sets of cloth shirts and trousers and 300 pairs of bandages, which have been handed over to the Songjiang Red Cross Society for distribution to wounded soldiers in the rear for replacement and treatment.

### Financial Problems During the War of Resistance

— Zhou Xianwen

We certainly know that China is a weak country, and a weak country needs long-term peace and should not talk about war. However, the environment since the September 18th Incident has clearly not allowed China to have long-term peace. China's demand for long-term peace can only be achieved by submitting to Japanese imperialism and becoming its colony. Therefore, China's demand for peace has a limit. Exceeding this limit, it must rise up in resistance. Although it is clear that this resistance will cause great losses to China, in order to avoid becoming a colony of Japanese imperialism without a fight, this unavoidable resistance is "sacred and inviolable." Now, the fierce flames of Japanese imperialism are becoming increasingly intense, and the "sacred and inviolable" resistance has already begun. How China should handle its finances during this period of resistance is indeed an extremely important question.

However, to answer this question, we must first estimate how much China needs to spend on this war. Today (the 22nd), the newspaper reported: Bank of China Chairman Song Ziwen recently met with a reporter from the London Daily Mail, saying he "did not want to reveal the amount of war expenses currently needed by China, but said it was insignificant compared to Japan." Song's "unwillingness to reveal" is naturally to "keep secrets." In fact, the amount of war expenses required for the war against Japan is related to the scope and duration of the war. Before the end of the war, it is impossible to have an accurate estimate. Taking the European War as an example, from 1914 to 1917, Britain spent a total of 4,142 million pounds, France spent a total of 66,076,396,830 million francs, Germany spent a total of 30,091,642 million marks from 1914 to 1916, and Russia spent a total of 23,458 million rubles from 1914 to 1916. The amount is so huge that it is astonishing. Such an astonishingly huge amount of war expenses is naturally beyond China's current economic capacity, so some "prudent" commentators believe that China is simply not qualified to participate in modern warfare. This kind of "prudent" remark is actually the mournful sound of "defeatists," the toxins of the Chinese national liberation movement. They do not know that China's resistance is out of necessity. They do not know that the outcome of the war between the two countries is related to the attitude of various countries in the world. They do not know the principle that "poor people can also struggle." They do not know that the war between imperialist countries (the European War) is fundamentally different in nature from the war between semi-colonial countries and imperialist countries. So, how will China's wartime finances be raised? Of course, in theory, this cannot go beyond the two methods of "increasing revenue" and "reducing expenditure." The former refers to increasing fiscal revenue; the latter refers to reducing fiscal expenditure. If we want to increase fiscal revenue during wartime, we must first know China's peacetime fiscal revenue; if we want to reduce fiscal expenditure during wartime, we must first know China's peacetime fiscal expenditure. Let us discuss them separately.

China's peacetime fiscal revenue, taking this year's budget as an example, is estimated to be about 1 billion yuan. Compared with the war expenses spent by Britain, France, Germany, and Russia during the European War, the difference is naturally very large. However, this is because one is during wartime and the other is during peacetime. The two situations are completely different. The current question is, in China, how much can the annual fiscal revenue be increased in wartime? To answer this question, we must take a look at the content of China's fiscal revenue. Taking this year's budget as an example, China's fiscal revenue is highest from customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax; that is, customs duties account for 26.90% of the total revenue, salt tax accounts for 11.85% of the total revenue, and consolidated tax accounts for 17.55% of the total revenue. The total of the three accounts for 7.72%. This is not only the case this year, but it can be said that it has been the case for many years. The above is a brief overview of China's peacetime fiscal revenue. As for the overview of China's peacetime fiscal expenditure, if we also take this year's budget as an example, the figure is still 1 billion yuan. What we should pay attention to now is: during China's resistance period, what parts of the annual fiscal expenditure can be saved and used for the war? To answer this question, we cannot help but take a look at the content of China's fiscal expenditure. According to China's peacetime fiscal expenditure, military expenses and debt expenses have always been the highest. In this year, military expenses account for 39.22% of the total expenditure, and debt expenses account for 32.45% of the total expenditure. The two together account for 71.67%.

Since the revenue and expenditure of China's peacetime finances are as described above, then what is the situation during this period of resistance? Let's start with the expenditure side. China's peacetime fiscal expenditure is mainly military expenses and debt expenses. During this period of resistance, how much can these expenses be reduced? This is the so-called "reducing expenditure" problem. Regarding this issue, I personally believe that this is not very important to China's wartime finances. Because China was originally a weak country, and various facilities have not yet been put on track, the annual fiscal revenue is, of course, "far behind" compared with various advanced and powerful countries. Even the annual fiscal expenditure is "insignificant" compared with various advanced and powerful countries. Moreover, during this period of resistance, military expenses will not only not decrease, but will increase greatly. Debt expenses can certainly be exempted, but in the overall wartime finances, it is only a "small supplement." As for other expenses such as cultural expenses, party affairs expenses, and internal affairs expenses, even if they can be reduced somewhat, they are really like a "drop in the ocean" compared with wartime finances. Therefore, China's wartime finances certainly need to "reduce expenditure," but it is even more necessary to "increase revenue." This goes from the expenditure side to the revenue side. China's peacetime fiscal revenue is highest from customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax. During wartime, how much can these revenues be increased? This is the so-called "increasing revenue" problem. Regarding this issue, we can say that during this period of resistance, these tax revenues will not only not increase, but will decrease as a result. Why? This is very clear. China's seaports are blockaded by enemy forces, and international trade is greatly affected. Customs duties will inevitably decrease. As for salt tax and consolidated tax, the salt-producing areas and factories of cotton yarn, flour, cigarettes, matches, cement, beer, etc. in China are mostly close to the war zone, and the result will inevitably be affected by the war, which will affect tax revenue.

In this case, China's finances will inevitably be very difficult during this period of resistance, right? But precisely because it is difficult, we must think of other ways. The common methods are nothing more than three: first, increase taxes; second, issue public bonds; and third, inflation. Let's talk about increasing taxes first. The government's newly established income tax and the proposed inheritance tax are, of course, beyond discussion. The proposals advocated by people at the time, such as collecting land value tax or land appreciation tax, as well as wartime profit tax or reorganizing land tax, are all ways to increase taxes. According to the collection of income tax and inheritance tax, under the current economic organization, even if we set aside wartime finances, it also represents the progress of the tax system and should be carried out. But if we say that China's wartime finances can be supplemented by income tax and inheritance tax, that is a kind of unrealistic fantasy. The reason for this is extremely obvious, because China has not yet fully met the conditions for implementing income tax and inheritance tax, and the international and technical difficulties of taxation cannot be completely overcome. As for land value tax or land appreciation tax, this is actually not a good way to increase tax revenue during wartime. Because once a war breaks out, the normally expensive urban land prices will inevitably plummet, and the impact will also cause rural land to fall in price. There is no "appreciation" to speak of at all. As for wartime profit tax, this can certainly be carried out, and should be carried out more. However, because China's military industry is not developed, the amount of so-called "wartime profits" is probably not large. The reorganization of land tax (land tax currently belongs to the income of local governments) is still a relatively large sum that can be collected. However, this also has a prerequisite, that is, the war can be sustained. Otherwise, it will be too slow to help. In addition, the natural increase in some taxes is worth mentioning. For example, although salt tax and consolidated tax have been reduced due to the occupation or destruction of salt fields and factories in coastal areas, at the same time, inland salt fields and factories will be more developed than usual due to the urgency of needs. As a result, it can form a natural increase in tax revenue. (Specifically for this part of the inland).

Secondly, let's talk about issuing public bonds; this can be divided into two points, one is domestic debt, and the other is foreign debt. Undoubtedly, whether it is domestic debt or foreign debt, issuing public bonds is always a major source of income for China's wartime finances. In other words, on the foreign debt side, in order to maintain the survival of the country and nation, we are willing to accept relatively harsh conditions and raise more funds from foreign countries. Regarding this point, Finance Minister Kong's efforts in the past few months have already achieved considerable results. On the domestic debt side, the 500 million yuan national salvation bonds have already been solicited. Although the results are not very good, this is not because the people lack the ability to bear the burden, but because the solicitation procedures are not well considered. Again, let's talk about inflation. Commentators often say that the foundation of China's inflation has already been built, and the problem is that the danger of inflation is too great, so we must be careful. Therefore, they advocate implementing limited inflation. But in my personal opinion, if inflation refers to the excessive issuance of banknotes, then the German mark during the European War can be taken as a lesson. The great danger is self-evident. As for implementing limited inflation, what is the standard for limitation? This is a real problem. It is important to know that once a war breaks out, the trend of currency inflation is inevitable. If the war is prolonged and there is no sufficient income to supplement it, then the currency will inevitably inflate further, and even lead to the excessive issuance of banknotes. Therefore, the theory of limited inflation is still feasible in peacetime, but less likely in wartime. In short, under a state of war, currency inflation is an inevitable trend, and this is not a special plan for raising war expenses.

Now, the War of Resistance has broken out, and the most likely and most effective way to raise war expenses is the ten characters of "those with money give money, those with strength give strength." This can be divided into two aspects, automatic and passive. On the automatic side, anyone with blood and spirit, regardless of wealth or poverty, knows that this resistance is a critical moment for the life and death of our country and nation. "Destroying the family to relieve the nation's difficulties" is what everyone wants. Those with strength automatically participate in service; those with money automatically contribute; (As for the property of high-ranking officials, it is especially necessary to contribute as much and as soon as possible to demonstrate promotion.) The latter can directly increase the country's wartime income, and the former can indirectly reduce the country's wartime expenditure. On the passive side, if the country needs labor, it may as well force conscription; if it needs property, it can also force requisition. As for the property of traitors, it is especially necessary to confiscate it as much and as soon as possible to warn traitors. These methods may seem a bit "excessive," but they are not. Because in this resistance, as long as the local authorities lead properly, the majority of the people will automatically "those with money give money, those with strength give strength." Even if a small part deliberately avoids it, due to the characteristic of so-called "feudal remnants" in China, compulsory conscription or requisition is not a strange or shameful thing.

During this resistance period related to the survival of the country and nation, "those with money give money, those with strength give strength" is the most likely and most effective way to raise war expenses in finance. Of course, in order to strengthen the possibility and effectiveness of this method, we must awaken the masses and organize the masses. Only the awakening of the masses is the only key for a semi-colonial country to defeat an imperialist country, and only then can a semi-colonial country raise war expenses during a war with an imperialist country.

### Refusal to Participate in the Tokyo World Games The Sports Community Salvation Association Appeals for Response from All Countries

Friendly nations are expected to declare justice and punish these evil accomplices. The Sports Salvation Association will handle registration immediately.

The Sports Salvation Association of this city, in response to Britain's refusal to participate in the Tokyo World Games, sent a letter to the National Sports Advancement Association a few days ago, suggesting that all countries be called upon to cancel the membership of the Japanese Olympic Committee. Yesterday, the responsible official of the Sports Association replied to the association, expressing his satisfaction, and also sent letters to friendly nations to declare justice and punish this evil accomplice. The original letter from Mr. Shen Siliang of the Sports Association is copied as follows: "Reply directly: Received your letter, and learned about the situation. The establishment of your association, saving the country and rescuing the nation, is a unique and brilliant event in our sports community. I am very pleased and also admire your suggestions, which are correct and pertinent. The Olympic Games are originally intended to promote friendship between nations and maintain peace. However, Japanese imperialism is arbitrarily brutal and destroys justice, causing universal indignation. The International League of Friends of the United Kingdom and the Sports Association took the lead in proposing to refuse to participate in the World Games to be held in Japan in 1940. When the news came, our association was deeply grieved and hated the national disaster. Having received such sympathy, we should immediately respond. We have immediately sent a letter to the association, expressing our warm comfort, and will also send letters to the sports associations of various countries, describing the facts of the Japanese atrocities, and clearly asking friendly nations to declare justice and punish this evil accomplice. We will also formally submit it at the meeting of representatives of various countries of the Olympic Executive Committee in 1938. I know that you are paying attention and use the announcement to inform you of the progress, hoping that you will take care of it. Sincerely, Shen Siliang, Director and Secretary-General of the China National Sports Advancement Association, to the Sports Salvation Association of the Chinese Sports Community." Also, the preparatory office of the Sports Salvation Association, in view of the fact that since the outbreak of the war, many comrades in the sports community have been displaced and lost, making it difficult to achieve the effect of finger-arm linkage, has started to handle registration work from now on, hoping that sports organizations and comrades in the sports community in this city will send letters directly to No. 787, Anhe Temple Road, Shanghai, for registration.

### British Financial Circles Refuse Yokohama Specie Bank Discount

Japan's Foreign Trade Progress is Extremely Worried

Central News Agency said, Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, October 14, published a special telegram from London on the 12th, saying, "The British civil anti-Japanese economic blockade movement is prevalent. All merchants are automatically stopping transactions with Japan, or canceling contracts that have been concluded. In the financial sector, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all Japanese-related bills, except for the Yokohama Specie Bank, have been refused discount. Japanese merchants can only use the Yokohama Specie Bank. Until this week, two of the five major banks in London suddenly demanded collateral for Yokohama Specie Bank bills before they would allow discount. The remaining three banks also have a strong tendency to follow the example of these two banks. Therefore, the Yokohama Specie Bank's funds have suddenly become short. It is found that 70% of Japan's trade with London is paid through the Yokohama Specie Bank. Now that it has been hit by this, the progress of Japan's foreign trade is extremely worrying. However, the British government is still avoiding implementing economic sanctions against Japan in the form of an order. This move by the two banks seems to have nothing to do with the government."

### Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Inspect Education in Various Places

In order to supervise the provinces and cities to earnestly follow the plan and promote various educational tasks during this extraordinary period, the Ministry of Education has now appointed Inspector Liang Zhao to inspect Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, Councilor Chen Can to inspect Jiangxi, Inspector Zhong Daozan to inspect Hunan and Hubei, Inspector Tang Xifen to inspect Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian, Inspector Zhou Bangdao to inspect Anhui, Inspector Xu Fengxi to inspect Sichuan, Xikang and Guizhou, and Section Chief Dai Yingguan to inspect Jiangsu and other provinces. It is heard that the key points of the inspection are: (1) the actual situation of education funds in various places during this extraordinary period and whether their distribution is appropriate, (2) the actual situation of the relocation of schools at all levels and the progress of the newly established temporary universities in the war zone, (3) whether the measures for schools in the inland to accommodate students from the war zone are being earnestly implemented, (4) whether vocational schools for cultivating intermediate technical talents needed during wartime are being actively promoted, (5) whether compulsory education and mass education necessary for arousing the national consciousness of the masses are being earnestly promoted in accordance with the approved plan, (6) whether the textbooks and other school supplies used by schools at all levels are meeting the supply and demand. In addition, if educational administrative organs in various places have special difficulties due to the war, the inspectors can present them to the Ministry for relief after on-site inspection. Those who have not done well or are not effective will be corrected at any time and place. In areas farther away from the war zone, education work can be intensified compared to peacetime. In areas closer to the war zone, education work can be carried out in accordance with the various measures set by the Ministry to carry out remediation, so as to ensure that there are no undesirable phenomena of relaxation.

### Madam Kong Cares for the Wounded Soldiers

Donates a Large Amount of Medical Supplies

Madam Song Ailing, wife of Vice President Kong, in view of the importance of the work of rescuing and caring for the wounded soldiers during the War of Resistance, has donated funds to establish wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai, Jiangsu and other places, and has repeatedly donated medical supplies. Now that the weather is getting colder, the need for clothing, bedding, and medicines in the wounded soldier hospitals in the interior is even more urgent. She has specially purchased a large number of cotton quilts, cotton clothes, and various medical supplies in Shanghai, which were transported by three or four large trucks yesterday to Suzhou for use in the local wounded soldier hospitals. It is reported that among these medicines, there is a large amount of special medicine for treating tetanus, which can treat at least a thousand people. Because many of the wounded soldiers on the front line suffer from tetanus, Madam Kong specially searched for and purchased them from various sources to meet the urgent need. It is also heard that the Shanghai Chinese Women's Association, inspired by the news, purchased a large truck of the same medical supplies and transported them at the same time.

### China-Japan Trade Association Cancelled

To Show Determination to Break Off Economic Relations with Japan, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, etc. Have All Resigned

The National Anti-Japanese Economic Severance Committee of this city, based on the resolution of the first Executive Committee meeting of the association, sent a letter to Zhou Zuomin, chairman of the China-Japan Trade Association, and Xu Xinliu, vice chairman, requesting that they immediately cancel the association to show their determination to break off economic relations with Japan. The original text reads, "It is found that item 8 of the resolution of the first Executive Committee meeting of this association states, 'Send a letter to the Chinese chairman of the China-Japan Trade Association to clearly announce the cancellation of the association, etc.' is recorded in the file. It is found that Mr. and other members are the Chinese chairman of the association. With the far-sightedness and wisdom of Mr. and other members, they must have already made a decision on the method of handling the association, and they must be happy to adopt the above-mentioned proposal. Therefore, the case is specially recorded and sent, respectfully hoping for your examination and handling, and also praying for a reply." Zhou and Xu replied to the association yesterday, saying, "I have received your letter and am very grateful for your teachings. Our hearts for patriotism are the same. Chairman Zhou, Vice Chairman Xinliu, and all 21 directors of our association have all resigned from their respective positions, and the association office will also be cancelled immediately. I know that you are paying attention, and I am writing to inform you, hoping that you will check it."

### The Northern China Frontline Urgently Needs Gas Masks

Because the Enemy Repeatedly Uses Poison Gas

According to a representative of the ××××× Army stationed in Shanghai, Commander-in-Chief ×× had a telegram mentioning that the best supplies for comfort from all walks of life would be to purchase more gas masks, because the tyrants have repeatedly used poison gas on the front line, so the army urgently needs a large number of gas masks. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "All telegrams are known. The comforts from all walks of life in Shanghai have greatly increased the courage of our army to work hard to kill the enemy. I cannot thank you one by one. Please express my thanks separately. At present, the bandits have been severely attacked by our army and are extremely frightened. They have disregarded any international law and humanity and are implementing the release of poison gas on the front line. Please express to all walks of life that if you receive comforts, it is best to purchase more gas masks, because there is no time to purchase them here."

### Various Groups Prepare to Welcome Kong

Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Kong, went to Europe this summer to attend the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor and took the opportunity to visit various countries in Europe and the United States, meeting with the leaders of various countries and exchanging various opinions on politics and economy. He worked hard for the country and achieved remarkable results. Vice President Kong has now returned home after completing his mission. The municipal party headquarters, municipal chamber of commerce, general labor union, local association, banking association, money industry association, shipping association, municipal education association, lawyers association, accountants association, anti-Japanese support association, and more than 30 other groups have decided to hold a grand welcome meeting in the coming days. The preparations have been made by personnel sent by the municipal party headquarters, chamber of commerce, and local association.

### Hoping that All Circles Will Comfort With "Black Dates"

Can be Stored for a Long Time and is Resistant to Hunger

In recent days, the front-line battles have been fierce. Our loyal and brave soldiers have charged into battle, almost forgetting to eat and sleep. Although light biscuits and dried beef are enough to be used as meals at any time, they may easily mold after being exposed to moisture and may be harmful to the health of the soldiers. Therefore, the front line is currently hoping that all circles will comfort them with black dates, because the dates can be stored for a long time and are extremely resistant to hunger.

### The Public Works Department Refuses to Accept Checks for Tax Payment, The Association Asks for Correction

The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Director General of the Public Works Department yesterday, saying, "Sir, I am directed to refer to the letter from the Shanghai Instrument and Stationery Industry Association, which states, 'According to the letter from our member, the Huaguo Chemical Glass Factory, which rents a warehouse on the first floor of No. 1 Hengye Lane, Jiangxi Road, British Concession, paid the police fee to the Public Works Department with a check from the Jin City Bank on the first of this month in accordance with customary practice. Unexpectedly, the bureau refused to accept it and said that it would only accept cash or checks from foreign banks. This matter affects Shanghai's financial situation and is extremely important. Moreover, taxes have always been paid by check, so why is this time uniquely different? Therefore, I am writing to ask your association to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Taxpayers Association to effectively negotiate.' In this regard, I am specially writing to you, asking you to make efforts to negotiate in order to maintain the national system and stabilize the financial situation, etc. It is found that the use of checks to pay debts is a common behavior for both the payer and the payee, and for the market to exercise, and it is also the recent order of the Ministry of Finance to stabilize the financial situation. Taxpayers should follow it. That is, your bureau should not have any objections to the obligation to accept checks in terms of absorption. In view of the foregoing, I am writing to your bureau, requesting you to quickly find a way to correct it in order to stabilize the financial situation and benefit taxpayers."

### The Number of Casualties in the Concessions Since the Shanghai War

The Continental News said that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, a total of 17 Chinese in the French Concession have died from stray bullets, and another 77 have been injured. The people who died from bombs in front of the Great World have not been included. In addition, two Russians were injured. Counting the Public Concession together, a total of 2,074 people died and 3,034 people were injured in the two concessions in the first two months of the war. It is found that in the January 28th incident, only two Chinese died in the French Concession on the first day of the war, and only six or seven Chinese were injured thereafter.

### Employees of Foreign Firms Launch a Winter Clothing Donation Campaign

Old and Broken Clothes and Shoes and Socks are Needed

The Shanghai Foreign Firm Employees Association said that at six o'clock, the weather turned cold, and the refugees in the war zones had no clothes or bedding. They were blown by the wind and rain, and their suffering was unbearable. They have launched a winter clothing donation campaign. All old and broken clothes, shoes, and socks are needed. In addition, the association has now established (1) a singing class, with class time set from 5:00 to 7:00 every Tuesday and Friday, and from 2:00 to 4:00 on Saturdays, at No. 641, Foch Road; (2) a current affairs discussion group, reporting on the news of the week, discussing and studying various current affairs and life problems, and member speeches, etc., with time set at 7:00 p.m. every Wednesday, at the association; (3) a weekly lecture, with time held at 1:30 p.m. every Sunday, inviting experts and celebrities to lecture on various important issues.

British Foreign Secretary Eden recently gave a speech in the House of Commons, stating, "The purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to stop the acts of massacre and suffering within China. The British government participates in the conference with the determination to do everything possible to make it a success." Since the September 18th Incident, our nation has suffered the poison of violent enemies. Now, we have been forced to resist in self-defense, and the disasters we have endured are indeed even deeper and wider. It is something we should deeply appreciate that friendly governments are making great efforts to stop the current acts of massacre and relieve the suffering of the Chinese people.

However, we must also make it clear to the friends of our nation that the Chinese people, as history has shown, have always been a peace-loving nation. Now, at this critical moment of national survival, we have launched the war of resistance. This war of resistance is anti-aggression and anti-war in nature. It not only indicates a new opportunity for our nation but also reveals a glimmer of hope for world peace. It must continue until the arrogance of aggression in the Far East is thoroughly extinguished and international relations in the Far East are completely stable. During the war of resistance, no matter how many prosperous cities and beautiful villages are ravaged and destroyed by the enemy, no matter how many respectable soldiers and lovable compatriots are massacred and abused by the enemy, our entire nation has no choice but to endure it for the sake of survival. This is because the lessons we have learned from the humiliating peace and appeasement of the past are too painful. We must never easily let go of the current new opportunity for the nation.

Based on the above concept, we believe that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can only guarantee peace in the Far East by adopting a collective sanctions approach against the aggressor country. But as Eden said, if the purpose of this conference seems to be only to have the warring countries cease fire, then the future of peace in the Far East is still very slim.

### The Enemy Pours All Efforts into Attacking Our Left Flank, Fierce Battle at Guangfu, Enemy Retreats Due to Being Unable to Hold

Stubborn Enemy at Gejia Archway Attempts to Break Through Without Success; We Hold a Very Advantageous Position on the Front of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway; Our Position at Chenjia Alley Moves Slightly Backward

Since our army ordered a full-scale general offensive, our loyal and brave soldiers, under the cover of airplanes and artillery, advanced fiercely to kill the enemy, achieving great victories on all fronts, and recovering more than thirty important positions. Having suffered this defeat, the enemy actively reorganized and prepared. Starting at dawn yesterday, they also desperately launched a counterattack against us. From Guangfu Town to Chenjia Alley, the artillery fire filled the sky, and the battle was fierce and unprecedented. Our army fought bloody battles, killing countless enemies in a day and night. The enemy retreated and advanced repeatedly, using a force of more than one brigade and dozens of tanks to try to invade our position in Guangfu Town. Fierce fighting continued until noon today. The enemy left hundreds of corpses behind and retreated in a terrible state. Our army is holding Guangfu Town tightly. If the enemy dares to try, we will annihilate them. The line north of Guangfu to Luodian is relatively quiet. Our army's position in Chenjia Alley suffered considerable damage due to the enemy's continuous bombardment. To avoid excessive sacrifice, it moved slightly backward. From last night to this morning, the stubborn enemies around Gejia Archway and Huanggang on the south bank of Fengcun Pond have been constantly breaking out and attacking, but they have all been repelled head-on by our army. Our army is still firmly defending positions such as Hulizhai and Sujiazhai. There are also fierce battles at Yujiazhai and Zhujiazhai on the front of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, where our army holds a very advantageous position. More than thirty enemy planes indiscriminately bombed Guangfu, Dachang, and Zhenru this morning. The enemy's heavy artillery concentrated its fire day and night, attempting to support the advance of their infantry. Our army defended calmly, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed.

### The Enemy Launches a Fierce Attack with a Large Force on the Line from Guangfu to Chenjia Alley

The Intensity of the Artillery Fire is Rare Since the Start of the Shanghai Battle; Fierce Fighting Until Noon Today, the Enemy is Already Unable to Hold and Collapses in Retreat

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that a correspondent of this agency accompanying the army in Guangfu reported at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that, after our counterattack succeeded in recovering several strongholds along the line from Guangfu to Lujia Alley, we pressed towards Liuhang, posing a significant threat to the enemy on the south bank of the Yunzaobing. To relieve the crisis, the enemy concentrated artillery fire on this line for two days and launched a fierce attack with a large force of infantry. Most of our newly built temporary fortifications were destroyed, so we retreated to the original positions. At dawn today, the enemy continued to use thirty or forty tanks to cover a fierce attack by a large force of infantry. The intensity of their artillery fire was particularly rare in recent days. However, our loyal and brave soldiers, all embracing the determination to defend the soil, responded calmly. Around 9:00 AM, enemy planes joined the battle, making the situation even more intense. Military sources also report that our position in Chenjia Alley was severely damaged by enemy artillery fire last night and was slightly moved backward. However, the position in Guangfu Town remained unshaken, while the area north of Guangfu was relatively quiet.

After our army ordered an attack on the entire Guangfu line, progress was rapid. The enemy army collapsed in panic and was at a loss. Our army advanced step by step, not yet deeply. After the enemy army collapsed, they reorganized and reinforced, and last night launched a fierce attack on our army positions from Guangfu to Chenjia Alley, to prevent our army from advancing. Intense fighting broke out near Guangfu. The enemy's artillery fire was dense, bombarding our army's positions. Dozens of tanks covered their troops' advance. Enemy planes were extremely active in the night sky. Our army responded calmly, not retreating at all. Our artillery also retaliated. The intensity of the artillery battle between the two sides was rare since the start of the Shanghai battle. Our soldiers all jumped out of the trenches and charged fiercely at the enemy, fighting hand-to-hand with bayonets and grenades, fighting bloody battles against the enemy, advancing without retreat. The attacking enemy showed signs of being unable to hold on until dawn this morning. By noon today, they were finally defeated and collapsed by our army, abandoning corpses all over the ground, in a state of great embarrassment. Our army is still firmly defending the Guangfu position, which is exceptionally solid. South of Guangfu, the enemy also launched a fierce attack on Chenjia Alley on the right flank of our army last night, acting rampantly. Our army fought bravely, engaging with them and killing countless enemies. Eventually, because many positions were destroyed by artillery fire, making it difficult to defend, they moved slightly backward, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack the enemy. The line north of Guangfu was relatively quiet last night.

### Enemy Troops at Gejia Archway Attempted to Break Through Last Night but Were Repelled Again

No Changes in the Positions on the South Bank of the Yunzaobing

On the south bank of the Yunzaobing, north of Dachang, the enemy troops trapped in the Gejia Archway and Huanggang area attacked our army several times last night, attempting to break through. After being hit head-on by our army, the enemy troops who rushed out were killed by our machine guns, scattered all over the field. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated to their original positions, hiding deep in the trenches, afraid to come out again. The two armies of our enemy each guard their original positions.

### Killing the Enemy on Three Routes South of Yunzaobing

Enemy at the Municipal Cemetery Moves Northward

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that a correspondent of this agency accompanying the army in Jiangwan reported at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that the enemy on the south bank of the Yunzaobing was blocked in the Gejia Archway and Huanggang area. After our army counterattacked and annihilated many enemies for several days, our army attacked from Hulizhai, Sujiazhai, and Chenjiazhai last night to this morning. Our army bravely charged, repeatedly pressing towards the enemy's positions. However, the enemy stubbornly defended with fortifications, and bullets flew like rain. After dawn, we still retreated to our original defenses.

A correspondent of this agency accompanying the army in Jiangwan reported at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that about 200 enemies near the Municipal Cemetery were moving northward, seemingly to reinforce Zhanghuabang. However, as of the time of the report, the enemy east of Miaohang had not taken any action.

A correspondent of the Central News Agency in Jiangwan reported at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that the enemy on the south bank of the Yunzaobing, west of the highway, had been attacked and was now actively attacking east of the highway. There were three fierce battles last night to this morning: ㊀ The enemy currently surrounded in front of Zhouchengzhai attacked with five or six tanks covering the infantry before dawn today, but they retreated immediately after being met with our resistance. ㊁ The line from Luzhai to Gaorenqiaozhai is where our army's position is exceptionally solid, so the enemy attacked several times in the past twelve hours, but they were severely damaged and failed to succeed. ㊂ The battle was very fierce in Chenjiazhai and Yujiazhai on the west side of the highway. The enemy attempted to control the highway and invade Dachang, so they did not hesitate to make heavy sacrifices and continued to attack. Their only tactic was to use intensive artillery bombardment and tank assaults, but our fortifications were solid, so they held on until this morning, and the enemy finally retreated.

### Our Air Force Bombs the Enemy's Armory

Fire Breaks Out Again on Broadway This Morning and Spreads; Enemy Navy Warehouse on Miller Road Completely Destroyed Yesterday

Behind the Nanyang Tobacco Company on Broadway, a fire broke out again around 6:00 AM today and had not been extinguished by 10:00 AM. It is reported that the enemy troops entrenched there suffered significant casualties. It is also learned that the enemy navy warehouse at No. 400 Miller Road, which contained a large amount of military supplies, was also hit by our air force last night and completely destroyed. The building also caught fire and burned until dawn this morning.

### Enemy Planes Continuously Bomb Zhabei

More Than Ten Bombs Also Dropped on Pudong, Injuring Several People

At 11:30 AM today, three enemy heavy bombers continuously bombed Zhabei and the vicinity of the North Station. At the same time, an enemy high-speed fighter plane flew high in the clouds to provide cover. They temporarily stopped their atrocities at 12:55 PM.

Enemy planes have been bombing Zhabei continuously for days, without interruption, and each time there are at least four planes. Each plane carries four bombs, so calculating with four planes, there are sixteen bombs. They circle over Zhabei for about thirty minutes, dropping all the bombs before flying towards Yangshupu. As for their bombing targets, on the 20th and 21st, they concentrated on the Maigen Road Station and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant area, as well as the Xinmin Road Police Station. However, starting this morning, their targets shifted to the North Station, Ningshan Road, and the Oriental Library area. At the same time, each time they dropped more than five bombs. However, apart from damage to our local civilian houses, there was no impact on our military aspects.

At 8:00 AM this morning, four enemy bombers again patrolled and bombed over Pudong, dropping more than ten bombs in succession. More than half of them landed in the fields, and a few hit civilian houses. In Shenjianong, one bomb destroyed a bungalow and injured Chen Xiangqi. Near Qin Ci Yangdian, one bomb injured Wu Xushi. In Zhangjiamen, one bomb destroyed two houses and injured Zhang Zhushi. In Qianjia Alley, one bomb injured Zhang Xiushan. In Wangjiazhai at the eastern end of Yangjing, one bomb destroyed a house and injured Wang Yuanshi.

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that at 10:30 AM today, three enemy planes scouted back and forth in the vicinity of Zhongshan Road and Zhongshan Bridge in western Shanghai. They then dropped three bombs at Dujiazhai, north of Datong University, killing one woman and injuring one man. Afterwards, they flew low in front of Datong University and strafed with machine guns, fortunately without injuring anyone. In Pudong, three enemy planes also indiscriminately bombed the area east of the Nisshin Pier and behind the Shenchang Warehouse and the China Merchants Huazhan Warehouse at 9:00 AM this morning, destroying many of our civilian houses. As for Zhabei and Dachang, multiple enemy planes continued to drop bombs, destroying more than ten civilian houses, but there were no losses to our military.

### Enemy Warships Transport Airplanes and Artillery Vehicles

Today (23rd) morning, four more enemy transport ships arrived in Shanghai, including the Nata and Maru, and the merchant ships-converted transport ships Jia Guda Maru, Guangde Maru, and Tianjin Maru. They docked at the North Dock and Middle Dock of the China Merchants Bureau and the Qiujiang Wharf, carrying three assembled airplanes, countless unassembled airplane parts, as well as artillery vehicles, heavy artillery, timber, and other military supplies.

### "Build Strong Forts, Fight to the Death!"

— Huai Qing

"Build strong forts, fight to the death!" It is said that this was Zeng Guofan's strategy of using troops. According to a senior officer, our side is now adopting this strategy in the Shanghai battle.

On the evening of the 20th, we learned of the news of the full-scale general offensive, so we drove along the intermediate road to the "headquarters" of a senior commander on the front line to hear the news of the battle and to inquire about the safety of Dachang and the situation on all fronts.

The reason is that the newspapers have been using large characters to report the bloody battle at Gejia Archway for days, and the enemy army has a plan to invade Dachang in one fell swoop. People can't help but feel uneasy about this news. Because the safety of Dachang is [important?], and the military focus of Zhabei is even more of a barrier to the prosperous city.

According to a certain officer, the gain or loss of a small village is really irrelevant to the overall situation. Now, although the enemy army in the direction of Hei Dahangzhai has penetrated deep into the vicinity of Gejia Archway and Huanggang, the situation in Dachang is still extremely stable. It is definitely not as dangerous as imagined. Now the enemy is surrounded by us on three sides, and the position is getting smaller and smaller, becoming an extremely narrow pointed shape; being confined to the tip of a bull's horn is no different from falling into a desperate situation. They exchanged a huge price for a few small villages, and because they occupied those small villages, they made themselves fall into an extremely unfavorable terrain. Their purpose and their current situation are probably a bit incredible even to themselves! That is to say, it is not easy for them to invade Dachang. There, we have extremely solid layers of overlapping trenches, equipped with strong forces. Even if the enemy only wants to occupy a foot, they have to prepare for a very big sacrifice!

The enemy's destination - a certain officer continued to say - is obviously in Nanxiang and Jiading, occupying the so-called "Songhu Non-War Agreement Zone; thinking that occupying those places can realize their quick victory and end [? ] the Shanghai battle. Therefore, their initial goal was to attack the old trick of the January 28th Incident, trying to land in Liuhe, copy our rear, and drive straight to Jiading, but this old trick failed, and they had to take Luodian with all their strength, and the goal was still in Jiading, but they were met with extremely strong resistance, so an unprecedented bloody battle of repeated gains and losses, and loss of troops and generals, was launched there, and they are still being blocked at Shi Xianggong Temple. Therefore, they can only change their plan and attack Chufu, but they are still blocked by us and cannot make progress. Therefore, the focus of the current battle situation is entirely on the line from Yanjiawan to Chenjia Alley on the south bank of Yunzaobing. Although the enemy's firepower is concentrated there, trying to break through the center; but they absolutely have no way.

A certain officer is extremely optimistic about the current battle situation. He never thought there was any danger.

"During the January 28th Incident, the 19th Route Army resisted for a month and always occupied an advantage; but later the enemy landed in Liuhe, and we had to retreat completely, and the army moved to Nanxiang and Jiading like water. Why doesn't the enemy still attack Liuhe with its main force this time, but insist on taking an extremely difficult central breakthrough plan at the cost of extreme sacrifice?" We asked a certain officer with half-understanding.

"The situation is different now," a certain officer replied with a smile. "During the January 28th Incident, because our military strength was not enough to control, the general retreat was out of necessity. Now that we don't worry about insufficient military strength, and we have seen through their tricks, the fortifications on the Liuhe side are built very firmly. Even if he brings up a marshal or two divisions of troops, it is not difficult for us to quickly annihilate him completely. In short, the enemy is hitting walls everywhere this time and never expected that this battle would be so difficult. This is an underestimation on his part, and he will defeat himself."

The sound of artillery rumbling and shaking the fields, a certain officer said excitedly: "Tonight we have been 'young masters' once. Our artillery has never fired so much. This is the first such big expenditure since the outbreak of the war. - Give the enemy a 'punishment' and let him know our interests."

All around were roaring artillery sounds, bullets came out of the artillery mouth, like a fire snake, and shot through the misty sky like an arrow. We were in the dance of these fire snakes, stepping on the undulating fields, and everyone forgot their safety in the tense atmosphere.

We embarked on the way home in the roar of the never-ending artillery fire. (October 22)

### Fierce Battle in Gehua Area of Northern Shanxi

[Taiyuan] Front Line News: The enemy in the central area attacked our Guancun and Gehua area south with a brigade. Fierce fighting continued all night on the 20th, and they are still in a stalemate. (October 22 Special Dispatch)

[Beiping] According to telegrams from the front line received here, the Japanese army's offensive in Shandong Province is extremely slow. The Chinese army is firmly defending the line of Yucheng and Linyi, which is extremely solid. The fortifications in the four suburbs of Yucheng are particularly impregnable, so although the Japanese army arrived at Lingxian, 30 kilometers southeast of Dezhou, at 9:00 AM this morning, everyone hopes that it will be met with strong resistance from the Chinese army.

### Shanghai Telephone Bureau Works Hard to Maintain Traffic in the City

Since the Shanghai War on August 13th, enemy planes have been wreaking havoc everywhere, destroying most of our cultural and transportation construction projects, and the losses are indeed not cheap. The city telephones of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, except for Zhabei, Wusong, the city center, Jiangwan, and other places that have been reduced to war zones and cannot be repaired, are still able to be called as usual for Nanshi, Pudong, Longhua, and Minhang in the county seat of the Chinese Concession. If the line is destroyed by artillery shells, the bureau will immediately send craftsmen to repair it, so that traffic will not be affected. However, since the outbreak of the war, residents have been moving frequently in the Nanshi Tongdong area, and the market is still extremely deserted, resulting in the number of users being less than one-tenth of the usual.

### Enemy Aircraft Scattering Banknotes, a Ridiculous Act of Desperation

—A Soldier-Accompanying Farmer's Account—

A reporter from this newspaper recently met a villager who had just arrived in Shanghai from the front lines of Maqiaokou (nine li north of Liubei River). He reported a very interesting piece of news that he had witnessed firsthand. According to him: "I am a farmer near Maqiaokou. Since the outbreak of the war, my family has taken refuge elsewhere. However, I could not bear to leave my ancestral home, the foundation of my family's livelihood. So, I remained alone in my home. Fortunately, the troops stationed in our village are highly disciplined and have a very good relationship with the villagers. They strongly encouraged the villagers to continue farming during the day and assist the troops in building fortifications at night. They were paid for their labor and given a day off every three days, so the work was not hard. The neighboring villagers were all happy to do it. My mother is responsible for miscellaneous tasks in the army at night, such as digging trenches, transporting bullets, delivering tea and meals, and carrying wounded soldiers. During the day, she sometimes cleans the battlefield and buries the dead. She is active in all these duties. In the two months since the war began, she has gained some basic knowledge of warfare and has accumulated more than ten yuan in wages, which is better than the displaced and wandering drafted men. Now I will tell the reporter an interesting fact: "Three days ago (the 19th), at about 9 a.m., four or five steamers suddenly unloaded more than 600 enemy soldiers from Japanese warships. They jumped onto the beach, formed several rows, and marched quickly towards Maqiaokou to land. At the same time, two enemy planes scattered two-corner, five-corner, and three-yuan banknotes in the air, flying everywhere, trying to tempt us. This made our troops even more indignant. At that time, our commander also anticipated that the enemy would launch a large-scale landing when they hoped our soldiers would be distracted. So, he divided his troops, aimed at the targets, and waited in full battle array. He ordered a small number of soldiers to pretend not to know and scramble for the banknotes. At this time, the enemy thought they had succeeded and rushed over immediately. When they were about a hundred meters away, our army swept the enemy with a dense network of fire. The two sides confronted each other for a long time. Finally, our army was brave and powerful, and the enemy fell to the ground one after another, with no one surviving. We seized more than 500 rifles and a lot of machine guns and ammunition. However, afterwards, dozens of us spent two days burying the enemy corpses."

### The Times Reports on Our Military Positions

Heavy artillery and aircraft bombardments everywhere are suitable; it is not easy to drive out the Chinese army

Mr. Zhang Tingrong, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Government, invited many foreign reporters from this port on Wednesday to guide them to the Zhabei war zone. The next day, all the foreign newspapers had records. They all praised the calmness and indifference of our soldiers under the bombing of enemy planes. The Shanghai Times reprinted a short article yesterday, saying that a group of foreign journalists returned from a tour of the rear of the Zhabei Chinese military front on Wednesday, praising the morale and tenacity of the Chinese army. They have all been subjected to heavy artillery and aircraft bombardments for many weeks. The Chinese army is in a position that others think is almost impossible to hold, but they feel it is suitable everywhere. This is the general result of the war. However, the defenders of Zhabei resolutely confronted the fierce attacks and built solid defensive works and lay in them. This state is due to their bravery and the effectiveness of their command. From north of Zhabei to the Yangtze River, the Chinese army is well-deployed and has the strength to resist the Japanese army fiercely. Although the front lines have been slightly broken, in many parts, they immediately counterattacked and restored the original state. Therefore, in terms of the entire front line, there will not be a major change for a while. A large number of fully equipped and well-commanded Chinese troops are stationed in the Shanghai war zone. Their positions are full of trenches and ditches everywhere. No matter how powerful the Japanese artillery and aircraft are, it is not easy to drive out the Chinese army. This is obvious. Now, one has to draw a conclusion. If there is an unpredictable change in the overall situation, the war will inevitably be prolonged, and both sides will consume a great deal of manpower and financial resources. Zhabei has now been turned into a wasteland due to the tragic aerial bombardment, and no one knows how much more property will be destroyed in the future.

### Pudong Pujiang Defensive Artillery War This Morning

The two sides fought until dawn with no fierce action.

From two o'clock this morning, enemy ships in the Pujiang River and the Pudong artillery unit engaged in sparse artillery fire. Every one or two minutes, one or two artillery sounds could be heard until dawn. This was a defensive battle between the two sides, so there was no drastic action.

### 〔Short Commentary〕

— Phase

According to reliable sources, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, from August 13 to October 5, the number of enemy soldiers killed and wounded totaled 65,000. The North China front is not included in this figure. Therefore, the enemy's use of troops against China this time has sacrificed at least 100,000 people. Naturally, our country has also made considerable sacrifices. However, this kind of sacrifice is for the country. It is a sacrifice for the survival of the nation. How valuable and meaningful is this sacrifice? Not only should our people offer incense and bow down to worship it, but even foreigners cannot help but praise it. And what will be the name of the enemy's sacrifices? It is only to fill the desires of a few aggressive ambitious people. Even a million is not enough.

### Talking About Jinan Amid National Crisis

— Ji Ping

(Special report by this newspaper) Just as the all-out war of resistance was being launched, due to the irresponsibility of a few local defending generals, the North China war allowed the enemy cavalry to drive straight in. The enemy took this opportunity to stir up trouble and fabricate various bizarre rumors against Lu and Han, causing people to panic and worry. Now everyone understands that they have been poisoned by the enemy again. Last night, the reporter met with Mr. Hu Hehuang Renzhi, who had just returned from Jinan. He had a very thorough observation of the political situation in Shandong. Here, I have written down what he said and reported it to the public, which is worth making people excited and comforted.

Throughout history, all domestic political changes have been poisoned by the Japanese's divisive and slanderous schemes. This time, the enemy vainly attempted to seize Shanxi first, and then used political disintegration to take Shandong in one fell swoop, completing his North China country dream. Therefore, he released air early, such as what Doihara met Han in Jinan, what Shandong protected the territory and people, and compromised with Japan, etc. Compatriots across the country have been discussing a lot. In fact, the Japanese were doing ghosts, and that's not the case. However, Chairman Han didn't care. He always advocated resisting the war to the end, and there was no need to defend himself to the outside world. When we (Mr. Huang claimed himself) arrived in Jinan, after two meetings with Mr. Han, we felt that this matter was of great importance. Then we discussed with his left and right and obtained his consent before we made the solemn statement last time. The enemy planes dropped secret letters in the sky over Jinan twice, to Mr. Han and the people of Shandong, saying a lot of words of not invading Lu Province and peaceful friendship. Nonsense is not worth laughing at. Mr. Han said that at this juncture, there is only resistance to the war, what else is there to say. However, the Japanese have not given up on this idea, and they are still creating rumors to confuse the public these days.

Japanese investment in Shandong has reached more than 300 million yuan, and the operation of industry and commerce is deeply rooted. They always can't bear to destroy the situation in Shandong. Therefore, they vainly attempted to occupy the four provinces of Ji, Cha, Jin, and Sui, and swallow Shandong in one breath without moving a single soldier. Even if they use troops, they must land at Longkou and Lianyungang, and go straight down to Xuzhou from the Jinpu Line. In this way, the two routes of sea and land attacked from both sides, with the half wall of Shandong as the core. In other words, the enemy wants to occupy the complete Shandong, and does not want to break the ground in Shandong. The enemy's dream is really ridiculous and hateful. Mr. Han once said to the Japanese僑, "In peacetime, I am responsible for protecting the僑. In wartime, I am not responsible." Therefore, when the war of resistance began, all the Japanese僑 in Lu Province returned to their country one after another. The Japanese employees of the Jiaoji Railway also returned. When they held a meeting and took a farewell photo at the Qingdao Japanese Consulate, everyone hugged their heads and cried. It can be seen that they hate the warlords and the anti-war emotions are high.

Seventy-seven of the 108 counties in Lu Province have implemented rural education, which has had considerable results. In terms of people's organization, Shandong is a very promising province. This cannot but be attributed to Mr. Liang Shuming, who tried rural education with great hardships. Mr. Liang is a great hero of Shandong's people's education. Therefore, Chairman Han also respects Mr. Liang very much. He believes in Mr. Liang's proposal very much. When we were in Jinan, we helped them organize a Shandong Provincial People's Mobilization Committee and a Anti-Enemy Support Association. Mr. Liang was elected as the chairman of the two associations. With Mr. Liang in Shandong, everything can be optimistic. In addition, the training of strong men in Shandong is also very good. With a mobilization, the power is very great.

When I was in Jinan, I heard that the war in northern Jin had turned for the better, and everyone was very excited. It is said that Li Fuying, who did not resist, was shot, and General Hao Duoling, who was loyal to the country, died in battle. Many generals suddenly realized their mission, giving the war a major turning point. After all, for good or for evil, the history books will be passed down forever.

After our mission in Jinan was completed, we wanted to go to the Pinghan Road for inspection, but because of some relationship, we were anxious to return to Beijing to report. We stayed in Xuzhou briefly on the way. Xuzhou is indeed an important town, and the national defense is very substantial. The local elders are also willing to come out to lead the people and participate in the work of supporting the war against the enemy. This is indeed the most precious atmosphere of national revival.

### Enemy Aircraft Continuously Bombing Inland Cities and Towns with Cruel Gestures

Hefei

The Hefei Air Defense Post suddenly received a phone call from Bengbu at 9 a.m. on the 18th, saying that four enemy planes were flying to Hefei to carry out an air raid. The post immediately sounded the bell to warn, and schools and churches throughout the city sounded the bell in succession. The military police immediately came out to guard. Four enemy planes arrived in the city sky at 9:10 a.m., circling and reconnaissance for a week, and did not drop bombs. They flew southeast along the Huainan Road. This is the third time that enemy planes have attacked Fei.

### Checkpoints Set Up on Important Water and Land Routes

Commercial goods and equipment pass with certificates, and strict sanctions are imposed for disobedience

In order to maintain order and facilitate transportation, the military authorities have set up checkpoints at important water and land transportation points in the rear of the front line. It is heard that the main tasks are: ㊀ Maintain order, ㊁ Investigate and arrest traitors, ㊂ Arrest fugitives, ㊃ Facilitate traffic, ㊄ Facilitate transportation. Since the establishment of checkpoints, any situation in which officers and soldiers block the road and detain cars and ships, or use military vehicles and ships to privately transport commercial goods, etc., will be strictly investigated and prohibited. When officers and soldiers travel alone, if they do not have a pass or road slip, they must be investigated to confirm that they are not suspected before they are allowed to pass. When troops and organs send people to escort public goods, equipment, and daily necessities, they must have a certificate or pass, and they will be released after verification. Merchants transport ordinary commercial goods and equipment from Shanghai with a certificate issued by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in the prescribed format, which will be released after verification to facilitate it. In the rivers near the cordon, if there are blockade facilities, the wharves, routes, and passage times will be stipulated for the passing ships, and the personnel will be dispatched by the institute to supervise the people and guide the loading and unloading methods. It is heard that the crackdown is extremely strict. Regardless of officers and soldiers of various troops or any public officials of any organ, those who disobey the correction will be strictly sanctioned regardless of the boundary.

The Catering Industry Long-Term Bond Purchases

The Shanghai Western Catering Industry Association, at the beginning of the outbreak of the war, was initiated by all the members of the committee to raise donations from all the industry. More than 2,000 yuan were raised and sent to the Anti-Enemy Support Association and the Refugee Relief Association. Later, more than 6,000 Guangbing biscuits were purchased and sent to the front line to comfort our brave and anti-enemy soldiers. It has now been learned that the association decided at the executive meeting the other day (20th) that, in addition to starting to raise donations for public bonds from the industry immediately, it was also decided that all the industry would purchase national salvation bonds for a long time in order to resist the enemy to the end and win the final victory. The simplified rules are as follows: ㊀ The association will make iron boxes and hang them on the counters of each store, sealed with fire lacquer, as long-term savings bond boxes. ㊁ Long-term savings will be started from now on to purchase national salvation bonds until the end of the war of resistance. ㊂ On the 1st of each month, a member of the association will be sent to collect the savings together with the manager of each store, register them in the book, and have the store stamp them to exchange for national salvation bonds. ㊃ The minimum savings standard is to save 1% of the daily income, the more the better. ㊄ If managers and employees are willing to save individually, they can come up with their own regulations for each store to save a certain amount per person per day, and then settle the accounts and distribute the national salvation bonds. ㊅ All savings of each store will be used to purchase national salvation bonds, and the association shall not spend a single penny.

Municipal Public Works Bureau Solicits Donations Separately

The Municipal Public Works Bureau, in addition to subscribing on its own, also spontaneously launched separate solicitations. As of now, the amount of privately solicited subscriptions has reached more than 6,000 yuan, which has been fully incorporated into the civil engineering team organized by the Chinese Institute of Engineers. The subscription form has been submitted to the association for collection.

### Enemy Goods Are Sold in Shanghai

All industries have paid attention to strictly refusing

Since the national economic boycott movement against Japan was launched in this city, enemy goods have also sought to be active. It is heard that Japanese companies such as Mitsui 洋行, South Manchuria Railway Co., Mitsubishi 洋行, Sumitomo Bank, and 正金 Bank have jointly sought to sell the goods stored in Shanghai. Representatives such as Fukuda (South Manchuria), Takahashi (Mitsui), and Shimizu (正金) have been assigned to secretly discuss changing the brand names and posing as goods from other countries to seek dumping. All goods are transported by trucks, such as cotton cloth, rayon, Taiwan sugar, sea cucumber, and various seafood products. Now all industry associations in this city have paid close attention and notified members not to accept them.

### Print "No Buying or Selling of Japanese Goods" on Commodity Wrapping Paper

The Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Handle

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified all industry associations, saying that, according to a letter from the Shanghai Vocational Circle Salvation Association, the city's companies and stores frequently contact people from all walks of life to buy and sell daily necessities. If the words "This company or store does not buy or sell Japanese goods" are printed on the commodity wrapping paper, it will alert the public, increase the hatred of the enemy, and express the determination of business compatriots to sever relations with the enemy. This move is limited in material resources and is simple and easy to implement for business owners, and can be a powerful propaganda for the economic boycott movement against Japan advocated by your association. It is hereby suggested that your association inform all industries to adopt this method as soon as possible. The association believes that this suggestion is sufficient to express the determination of the business community and is an aid to encouraging compatriots. The matter is feasible, and a letter is sent to inform you, and it is hoped that your association will notify all industries to check and handle it.

### A Cotton Vest Is Better Than a Brocade Robe

A thank you gift from the front-line warriors

The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association Investment Committee has set up a public opinion collection office in order to gather ideas from all sides. It has received more than 400 suggestions. The other day, it received a letter from Mr. Li Xiaobai, a loyal and brave soldier on our front line, saying that the cotton vests donated by patriotic compatriots in the rear were very suitable for our armed comrades. Patriotic compatriots who have donated can be comforted when they hear this. The original letter is disclosed as follows: "To the comrades of the Design Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, the Japanese invaders are a common anger to adults. All compatriots have risen up to fight for the country and for survival. In recent days, we have received the cold clothes and food sent by our brothers and sisters in the rear, and we have become more and more enthusiastic. Even in the bloody battle with the enemy on the battlefield, we have not felt the suffering. I came to Shanghai with the army from ☓ and fought with the enemy for more than ten days. The weather suddenly turned cold and I had to use charge to keep warm. Suddenly, I got a cold cotton vest, like a brocade robe with sewing thread in the bag, which is even more encouraging. Our soldiers have the inescapable responsibility to kill the enemy and defend the country. How dare we not work hard? For more than 20 years, we have been determined to resist the enemy, and now we will pay it off. This time, the enemy army increased its defenses and heard that our army was coming, and they fled in panic and dared not fight head-on. They chased for more than 50 li overnight and forced the enemy to ☓, killing countless enemies. The spoils of war have been transported to ☓ for storage, which is comforting. The enemy has exhausted the power of its naval, land, and air forces to come to us, but it has not succeeded. This is due to the spiritual victory over the enemy of compatriots across the country. The enemy's momentum has become the end of a strong crossbow. Compatriots rise up and unite to persist in the war of resistance. The final victory is ours. The humble soldier Li Xiaobai wrote in the black light of the field flashlight in a certain place on the front line, October 16."

### Customs Pay Attention to Smuggling Vessels

Xin Sheng News Agency said that in the past few weeks, boats transporting private goods have suddenly been discovered in the Huangpu River. After unloading garbage in the Yangshupu area, the boats secretly transported a large number of Japanese private goods back at night. The Jianghai Customs has now received this report and is strictly ordering the customs patrol boats stationed at the Waibaidu Bridge to pay close attention to the investigation of the war.

Youth in Wartime, Issue 19

### How Should the Youth of Today Improve Their Lives?

— Leng Xueqiao

We feel that past education has mostly only paid attention to the aspect of teaching, and has not focused on management, nurturing, and defense, etc. Therefore, among the four words of management, teaching, nurturing, and defense, only the word "teaching" has been accomplished. As a result, most of the current youth only possess some intellectual knowledge from textbooks, and do not understand manners, let alone discipline. They are wasteful and lazy, with weak wills. Imagine, how can we expect such youth to love their country and take on the major responsibility of defending the nation?

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident in Shanghai, many enthusiastic young people have participated in various national salvation works, such as student soldiers, boy scouts, and wartime service corps. However, the majority of young people are still well-fed all day long, doing nothing. They don't know what else to do besides eating and sleeping every day. They have thrown away the training they received on weekdays. Even worse, some unscrupulous young people, despite the national crisis, are still dancing and watching their movies. Even if wounded soldiers are carried past them or refugees are lying at their feet, they can remain indifferent and unmoved. Alas, with such youth in a country, it is truly not far from its demise.

In the past, our country's education for young people emphasized theory and did not pay attention to practice; it only knew how to read books to death and did not know the principles of being a person. Therefore, I believe that the lives of young people in the future must be improved. If the youth themselves cannot be healthy, then we cannot really expect them to take any responsibility for the country and the nation. Because the ancient saying goes, "Cultivate yourself, manage your family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world," it can be seen that the great task of governing the country and bringing peace to the world must start with self-cultivation, especially starting with small things. Therefore, I believe that the following points are really a few points that the current youth must achieve; the lives of the current youth must have the following improvements.

First, be filial to parents, respect teachers, and be kind to others. All actions must conform to the rules; everything must be in order. If young people have this good attitude, then the impact on society will naturally make the country rich and strong. In the past, the lives of young people were too chaotic, simply disregarding everything, thinking that there was nothing but themselves. Therefore, there were disputes in the family, disturbances in the school, so that society could not be peaceful, affecting the country's survival and being bullied by the enemy. Therefore, in the future, the lives of young people must indeed have rules, because this is the fundamental condition for the country to survive.

Second, in our lives, things that should be done must be done, and things that should not be done must not be done no matter what. Even if there is no reward for things that should be done, we must still do them despite the difficulties; things that should not be done, even if there are significant benefits, we still do not do. Like the various national salvation works now, many young people do not hesitate to sacrifice their precious spirit, time, studies, and everything, and bury themselves in hard work. Only such youth can be worthy of being the new youth of the Republic of China. If they encounter some difficulties, they immediately retreat; or they are only willing to work if there are profitable things to do; this behavior is simply no different from that of a traitor. Therefore, in the future, all work of young people must be premised on being beneficial to the country, and they must never do various things that should not be done based on their own interests.

Third, now that we are in this extraordinary period, all manpower and material resources must be particularly frugal. If we take useful time to waste and valuable money to squander, it is really no different from borrowing a knife to commit suicide, which is most regrettable. However, there are still many young people now who, with disaster imminent, are still living a life of singing, dancing, and peace in a dream, extravagant and wasteful, doing everything. Therefore, in the future, young people must be hardworking and strive to become stronger, and must never seek selfishness and self-interest again, otherwise the country will really have no hope.

Fourth, the lessons that the enemy has given us today and the pain that we have felt are very profound. Know that if the country still has no hope, then our descendants will still suffer greater and deeper pain than we have suffered. If this great humiliation cannot be remembered in the mind, then one cannot be considered human. However, the young people now still think it is nothing, and do not feel ashamed at all, as if it were a natural environment, treating it indifferently. Therefore, in the future, young people must deeply realize this point. If every young person can remember the humiliation firmly, then the humiliation of the country can also be immediately wiped away.

In addition to the above four points, like the aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the few points that young people should improve now, I have also given a few examples above. In short, all actions must be in accordance with propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, in order to be worthy of being a young person of the new era; I earnestly hope that young people will sincerely and earnestly implement them.

Now the country is facing a very critical juncture, and all life is war, and all must strive. We feel that the failures of the past were due to the youth going astray; now it is time to turn back, and there is still time to save it. If we still cannot strive, then the beautiful rivers and mountains and thousands of years of history will be forever lost. We must, no matter what, wash away our humiliation and fight for our country. If we want to fight for our country, we must first pay attention to our own cultivation, improve all bad habits, bury ourselves in hard work, and be hardworking. If all the young people in the country can strive, I think the enemy will retreat when they see this spirit of our youth; and our country will naturally reach a state of wealth and strength.
