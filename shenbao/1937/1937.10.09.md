### Chiang Kai-shek Expresses Support for U.S. President's Stern Position

Our Soldiers Will Not Stop Until Justice is Established. Foreign Minister Wang Expresses Similar Sentiments and Thanks to Friendly Nations. He Hopes Powerful Nations Will Take Active Measures to Uphold Law and Morality.

[Nanjing] An Associated Press reporter yesterday visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, inquiring about his feelings regarding President Roosevelt's speech. Chairman Chiang issued the following statement: "The U.S. President has issued a famous statement advocating the respect for human rights and the sanctity of treaties. This not only moves the people of China, who have endured great hardship, but also excites those powerful nations who have always advocated for lasting peace built upon international morality. When the September 18th Incident occurred, the international community failed to cooperate in upholding treaty obligations, causing the world to suffer all sorts of serious consequences. Now, Japan once again disregards everything and repeats its aggression throughout China, directly believing that it is above any treaty or international law. Japan believes that all countries should obey its command regarding any issue in East Asia. For years, China has been moving towards unification, striving for peaceful construction, but Japan wants to destroy it with one cold blow. Japan does not allow any country to question or comment on its actions and plans, as if it considers itself the supreme legal authority in the world. Japan's aim is nothing more than to impoverish and weaken the Chinese people, eliminating their purchasing power completely, disregarding that China's purchasing power is an essential element in promoting international commerce. It not only wants to seize our nation's livelihood and monopolize the Chinese market but also wants to dominate the entire Pacific region. If this conquest of China is a delusion that China cannot overcome on its own, and other relevant countries cannot legally stop it, then China's great market will surely fall, and there will never be peace in the Pacific situation. Fortunately, today's news is that the U.S. State Department and the League of Nations General Assembly have both taken steps to condemn Japan as an aggressor, which deeply moves the Chinese people. We are now fighting to achieve the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops so that we can continue our peaceful construction plan. Our determination to defend ourselves is consistent from beginning to end. Even if it comes to the last soldier and the last inch of territory, we will not change our original intention. We will not stop resisting until justice is established and treaties regain their dignity. If countries that signed relevant treaties continue to allow international justice and law to be trampled upon, allowing Japan to continue its brutal aggression, it is tantamount to supporting its poisonous plot to defeat and destroy us. Now, the U.S. President has issued his great statement, clarifying human rights and peace, which makes us believe that those who uphold justice will surely get their wishes." (Central News Agency, 8th)

[Nanjing] Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui met with reporters on the 8th and issued the following statement: "China's current resistance is purely to maintain justice and humanity. In recent days, many facts have been gratifying, that all peace-loving countries in the world have risen up together and gathered under this clear banner with China. Civil society groups around the world have passed numerous resolutions expressing their deep sympathy to the Chinese people, and major politicians and leaders from all walks of life in various countries have condemned Japan's aggression against China, especially its killing of Chinese civilians, in Geneva and elsewhere. I, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, express my sincere gratitude to these groups or individuals for all the moral and spiritual assistance they have given us during this national crisis. The Chinese government and the people have always firmly believed that truth and justice will ultimately prevail over might. Although the recent resolutions passed by the League of Nations General Assembly regarding the Sino-Japanese incident, and the first and second reports, are still somewhat lacking compared to the actions that China hoped the League of Nations could take in accordance with the Covenant, they are sufficient to clearly show that the entire civilized world is at least spiritually sympathetic and willing to support China in its resistance to aggression. This report has also established an important fact: that Japan's actions this time are a destruction of its treaty obligations, especially its obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and are absolutely indefensible. What is now hoped for is a swift and active measure to halt Japan's arbitrary destruction of international treaties and the fundamental principles of justice and humanity. Regarding the incident of Japan's aggression against China, the U.S. State Department has now reached the same conclusion as the League of Nations. The statement issued by the U.S. State Department on the 6th stated that Japan's actions are inconsistent with the principles of regulating international relations and violate the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Moreover, President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago a few days ago has won the sincere support of all peace-loving countries. The principles stated by Roosevelt can be said to be timely and sufficient to serve as the basis for the United States and the League of Nations to jointly work to contain international aggression. Although Roosevelt's speech did not explicitly mention the Sino-Japanese conflict, there is no doubt that the peace crisis he pointed out already exists in the current Far Eastern situation. Roosevelt reiterated that no country should hope to escape the terrible consequences of international chaos through isolation or neutrality, which is an accurate and unchanging argument. Only when all peace-loving countries understand this principle and work together to reverse the trend can international morality be prevented from being completely destroyed. Now, the unanimous opinion of the world inside and outside the League of Nations has recognized that important peace treaties in the Far East have been destroyed. The current question facing the civilized world is how to restore the dignity of international treaties and save the world from returning to the great chaos of the past. From the Far Eastern Incident in 1931 to Japan's large-scale invasion of China, the facts have proven that merely stating morality and passing resolutions are not enough to restrain Japan, which is controlled by warlords and despises public opinion. If the Far East is to be restored to peace, peace-loving countries must take active measures to uphold the dignity of law and morality. President Roosevelt said, 'All nations who wish to live in peace under international moral standards can and should find a way to make their aspirations prevail over the evil forces of disorder and lawlessness.' I fully agree." (Central News Agency, 8th)

### U.S. Statement on Attending Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Roosevelt Returns to Washington, D.C., Calls Cabinet Meeting. Davis Summoned to Washington.

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the press, saying that the State Department has not yet received an invitation to the conference of the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, but he intends to accept participation once the invitation arrives. When asked whether the State Department's public condemnation of Japan yesterday would be sufficient to trigger the implementation of the Neutrality Act, Hull replied that the public statement was purely based on the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. As for whether the nine countries of South America agree, the State Department did not consult with those countries before issuing the public statement because the United States made this decision alone as a signatory of the Nine-Power Treaty. When asked if the rumor that the Nine-Power Treaty conference would be held in Washington was accurate, Hull did not express an opinion. He also declined to comment on former Secretary of State Stimson's suggestion that the United States and Britain should jointly boycott Japan. (Havas, Central News Agency, 7th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt returned to Washington D.C. this morning and convened a cabinet meeting in the afternoon to discuss issues such as international cooperation to prevent war and convening a special session of Congress. The President arrived in Washington D.C. at 8:30 this morning after touring the northwestern states, and many government officials welcomed him at the station. (National News, 8th)

[Washington] Prominent American political figure Davis, who has repeatedly served as a special envoy for the United States and attended major European conferences, has been urgently summoned from New York to Washington and arrived this morning. He will discuss with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull the U.S.'s participation in the Nine-Power Treaty conference. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)

[New York] According to the New York Times, if the Nine-Power Treaty conference is held in London, the U.S. government will likely send Special Envoy Davis to attend. Davis is a friend of President Roosevelt. Whenever there are major diplomatic issues, Davis represents the U.S. government in Europe, and is therefore known as the "Special Envoy to Europe." (Havas, Central News Agency, 8th)

[London] The location of the Nine-Power Treaty conference has not yet been decided. Procedures for holding the meeting are currently being actively discussed through diplomatic channels. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)

### Germany Also Not Participating in Pacific Conference

[Berlin] Although German political figures refused to comment on the U.S. State Department's public statement yesterday, they all acknowledged that it was a startling move. They said that Germany has significant economic interests in the Far East and will naturally pay close attention to the development of the situation. Germany is not a signatory of the Nine-Power Treaty in Washington and will not participate in the arbitration of the Sino-Japanese dispute. (Havas, Central News Agency, 7th)

### Japanese Ambassador Saito Visits Hull

British Ambassador Visits Japanese Vice Minister

[Washington] Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Hiroshi Saito visited Secretary of State Hull today, reportedly for the purpose of exchanging information. Afterwards, Saito said that he did not raise any protests regarding the League of Nations' criticism of Japan's actions in China. However, he voluntarily visited Hull to explain certain information. He did not believe that the State Department's declaration would strain U.S.-Japan relations. He believed that the recent progress in the Far East conflict could clear the air and promote a better understanding between the two countries. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 7th)

[Tokyo] British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Clive visited Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi at the Foreign Ministry today for a long discussion. Although no official statement was issued, it is widely believed that the content of the meeting was related to inviting Japan to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty conference. (National Maritime News, 7th)

### Hirota Has Audience with Emperor, Reports on International Situation

Cabinet and Privy Council Both Hold Meetings. Will Issue Declaration Responding to U.S. Attitude

[Tokyo] The Japanese Cabinet held a meeting today to discuss the international situation. Foreign Minister Hirota met with the Emperor to report on the attitudes of various countries towards the Sino-Japanese conflict. Prime Minister Konoe also entered the palace shortly after to report on general affairs to the Emperor. Soon after, the Privy Council also held a meeting for a long discussion. The Minister of Finance discussed the issue of issuing public bonds again with the President and Vice Presidents of the Bank of Japan. (National News, 8th)

[Tokyo] A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry met with foreign reporters this afternoon, saying that the Japanese government has decided to issue a statement that can be made public on the 8th. When asked whether it was issued in response to the U.S. statement and the League of Nations resolution, the spokesman avoided answering. When asked whether the rumor that Japan would abandon the Nine-Power Treaty was true, he also did not answer. (Central News Agency, 8th)

[Tokyo] This morning, all newspapers published articles opposing the U.S. State Department's statement. The Asahi Shimbun said that Roosevelt's speech and Hull's statement seemed aimed at providing spiritual support to the League of Nations and could be used to justify the safety of some domestic opinions and actions. The United States has always had a correct understanding of the Far East, and its past actions show that it is seeking to end the current war urgently but without investigating the cause. Trying to resolve the situation without sufficient understanding will only increase disputes. The actions of various countries only fuel China's fighting spirit. The League of Nations invites a situation contrary to its purpose, which must be noted. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun expressed surprise and regret over the U.S. attitude and further argued that the Kellogg-Briand Pact does not deny any war, so it does not prohibit self-defense wars or punitive wars. The United States and other countries only see the surface or are misled by superficiality and take rash actions. Even if the motives are good, they will greatly harm world peace and the maintenance of justice. The Miyako Shimbun said that Japan will stand in a state of siege and must be aware of future difficulties and not retreat a step. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that the League of Nations and the United States want to accuse Japan of violating the treaty and convene a meeting, which will naturally not be accepted. The Pacific Conference is nothing more than two methods: one is limited to moral sanctions, and the other is to implement an economic blockade through the League of Nations. The United States has a decisive dominance in the meeting and must be paid attention to. The other newspapers are largely the same. (Central News Agency, 8th)

### Japan Plans to Abandon Nine-Power Treaty

Japanese Securities Plummet

[Tokyo] The Japanese Cabinet met today to discuss the changes caused by the League of Nations and the U.S. government issuing declarations on the Sino-Japanese conflict. It is rumored that Japan plans to declare the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees the political and territorial integrity of China, abolished. Some say that the declaration of abandonment of the treaty has reached an inevitable point. At present, the Japanese stock market is panicking greatly due to the U.S. State Department's declaration condemning Japan's atrocities, and most securities have seen a drastic decline. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)

### U.S. Will Implement Military Expansion

British Government Greatly Welcomes

[New York] Regarding President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago denouncing Japanese aggression, The New York Times stated today that the American financial community deeply feels that the United States will implement a broad military buildup program in the future. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)

[London] There is great attention here to the news of the U.S. government's large-scale military expansion. It is reported that the cost of this military expansion plan will reach $2,000,000,000. The Daily Mail states that all of Britain welcomes the United States' strengthening of its military because its purpose is exactly the same as Britain's military expansion, which is to safeguard world peace. The report also states that this move will have a significant impact on political and economic development. (National Maritime News, 8th)

### German Authorities Deny Supplying Military Equipment to Japan

[Berlin] Rumors have spread that Germany has already or will conclude a contract to sell military equipment worth 40 million Swiss francs to Japan. Responsible authorities here have sternly refuted this rumor, stating that they have not signed any military equipment contract with Japan and that the above rumors are absolutely baseless. (National Maritime News, 8th)

### U.S. Military Officer Plans to Lead Volunteers

To China to Join the War Against Japan

⊙Los Angeles U.S. Army Major General Hahn, a junior officer, declared that he will lead a troop to China in a private capacity to participate in the War of Resistance Against Japan. According to Hahn, he can gather 10,000 veterans and volunteers to participate in the war. The problem is transportation costs. He also said that if he cannot raise the funds within this month, he will temporarily suspend his plan to lead the entire army and will only go with a small number of volunteers at their own expense. In other words, he will start with 250 people, including 200 pilots, and the rest will be machine gunners and specialized technicians with combat experience. According to Hahn, placing this small, well-trained army in key positions in the Chinese army will demonstrate its power. After our people's abilities are recognized, the Chinese will definitely welcome us. At that time, all those who sympathize with China will have the opportunity to do more for China. (National News, 7th)

### British and American Labor Unions Contact Each Other to Boycott Japan

Major U.S. Department Stores and Factories Have Begun to Stop Buying Japanese Goods

[New York] Three major U.S. groups today all endorsed a boycott of Japanese goods. American Federation of Labor President Green has suggested boycotting all Japanese goods in opposition to "Japan's desire to control China." The American Standards Protection Association, organized by major manufacturers, also announced its support for a permanent boycott of Japanese raw materials and finished products. At the same time, the Anti-War and Anti-Fascist Alliance announced that it has completed a plan to patrol retailers selling Japanese goods. (National News, 7th)

⊙Denver, USA It seems that the powerful U.S. labor union's movement to boycott Japanese goods will become a reality today. President Green of the union stated that he knows that the American Federation of Labor will be able to endorse Sir Walter Citrine's telegram from the leaders of the British Labor Party, requesting a joint boycott of Japanese goods to deal with Japan's barbaric behavior. (National News, 8th)

⊙Denver, USA American Federation of Labor President Green today submitted to the AFL's annual convention a request to endorse the British Labor Party's boycott of Japanese goods. Vice President Woll also called for a boycott of Japanese goods, saying that he is convinced that the American people do not want to indirectly help Japan carry out its brutal war of aggression. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 7th)

[New York] National department stores have now canceled orders worth millions of dollars for Japanese goods due to the enthusiastic anti-Japanese sentiment of the American people. There are now pickets monitoring stores selling Japanese goods. (National News, 8th)

[London] The civil society movement in Britain to boycott Japanese goods is underway in many areas. The Labor Party newspaper is now vigorously promoting it. Several cooperative societies have passed lectures opposing Japanese aggression and promoting a boycott, and many free churches in England and Wales have also taken the same action. The Daily Citizen today published in large letters a telegram from Ms. Soong Ching Ling, stating the situation of China's struggle for national survival and requesting that the great British Labor Party express its sympathy with concrete actions to stop Japan's arrogant destruction of civilization. However, the force of those advocating caution is also worth noting. For example, Councillor Roswell, Speaker of the Salford City Council, stated today that although the city expresses its sympathy for China, the boycott is a dangerous tool and easily becomes an explosive. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)

⊙Victoria, Canada The Victoria Trades and Labor Council executive committee today passed a resolution endorsing a boycott of goods from Japan, Germany, and Italy. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 7th)

### U.S. Government Statement Original Text

Recognizes Japan's Violation of Treaties

⊙Nanjing On the evening of October 6, 1937, the U.S. State Department issued the following statement to the press: The League of Nations Advisory Committee stated that the committee's report on the current situation in China and Japan's treaty obligations has been passed by the committee. The original text has been reported to the U.S. State Department by the U.S. Minister to Switzerland. According to the Minister, the report was adopted by the League of Nations General Assembly on the 6th of this month. Since the beginning of this conflict in the Far East, the U.S. government has taught and persuaded the governments of China and Japan to curb hostile actions, and proposed to assist both sides in finding a mutually acceptable peaceful solution to the Far Eastern situation. On July 16 and August 23, the U.S. Secretary of State publicly elaborated on the U.S. government's attitude towards international issues and international relations. This attitude is applicable to the whole world, and it is especially applicable to the current unwelcomed hostile actions between China and Japan. The U.S. government believes that the principles necessary for maintaining peace in handling international relations are: all countries should avoid using force to conduct their national policies, and avoid interfering in the internal affairs of other countries; apply peaceful negotiations and consultation procedures; adjust international issues; mutually respect the rights of other countries; and abide by the defined obligations; and maintain the principle of the sanctity of treaties. On October 5, the U.S. President further detailed these principles in Chicago, emphasizing their importance, and when discussing the international situation, he pointed out that without observing the moral principles of law and covenants, there will be no stability or peace, whether domestically or internationally. The state of international chaos will destroy all foundations of peace, and this situation will inevitably endanger the current or future security of all countries, large and small. Therefore, the American people believe that it is extremely important and concerning to restore the dignity of treaties and international morality. In terms of the development of the situation in the Far East, the U.S. government has been forced by the facts to state that Japan's actions in China are not in line with the principles that should be used to handle international systems and violate the Nine-Power Treaty of February 6, 1913, which was signed to handle the principles and policies that should be observed in handling Chinese events, and the provisions of the Kellogg-Briand Pact signed on August 27, 1928. The government's continued arguments regarding the aforementioned matters are generally in line with the conclusions of the League of Nations General Assembly. (Central News Agency, 8th)

### Italy Sends More Reinforcements to North Africa

Also Recruits New Soldiers

⊙Naples Another 2,000 Italian soldiers will be sent to Tripoli to strengthen the defense of Libya. This is the fourth reinforcement in three weeks, bringing the total number of Libyan defense forces to over 16,000. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)

⊙Rome Regarding the rumors that new recruits from the 1907, 1908, and 1909 classes in Italy will be drafted into the army, responsible sources had previously denied them and now reiterated that only new recruits from the 1909 class in a certain district will be drafted, and only those who are interested in specialized technology will be drafted. This is to encourage the enthusiasm of these skilled talents. (Havas, Central News Agency, 7th)

⊙Rome The autumn session of the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party, originally scheduled to begin tonight, has been postponed indefinitely. Responsible sources in Italy stated that the reason for the postponement is purely "technical." (Havas, Central News Agency, 7th)

### British Foreign Secretary Responds to U.S. President

Soviet Foreign Committee Newspaper Expresses Approval; French Parliamentary Speaker Herriot Condemns Japanese Atrocities

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden received U.S. Chargé d'affaires Johnson today, stating that the British government deeply agrees with President Roosevelt's foreign policy speech in Chicago, considering it a genuine contribution to peace. (8th National Telegram)

[London] British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Plymouth, spoke today at the Scarborough Conservative Party Congress, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the large number of civilians who have died in the Far East. He stated that when the Conservative Party holds a public meeting on Friday, British Prime Minister Chamberlain will speak in detail about the Far Eastern situation. (7th Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)

[Moscow] The Soviet Russian Foreign Committee expressed sincere welcome to President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago, but stated that if one wishes to stop Japan's aggression against China, it is necessary to take resolute collective action. According to the Communist Party's organ, "Pravda," today's publication stated that the United States' new attitude towards the Far East conflict shows that Japanese aggression has reached the point of disrupting world opinion. The continuous attacks by aggressors have made it impossible for countries to continue to embrace the so-called "non-interference policy," and they must take effective collective measures against the instigators of this "new world war." The newspaper believes that if all peace-loving countries truly unite, then stopping the instigators of war will not be a problem at all. (8th National Maritime Telegraph)

[Moscow] The Soviet government and the Communist Party organ today unanimously published commentaries supporting U.S. President Roosevelt's foreign policy declaration, and stating that Soviet Russia is willing to fully support collective action to deal with aggression. Pravda and Izvestia praised President Roosevelt for being able to warn the American people with complete truth, which is truly commendable. Pravda also stated, "The faces of the aggressor countries may seem fierce, but in reality, they are not that frightening. If peace-loving countries can approach them with joint action, they will surely be able to stop the spread of war." (8th National Telegram)

⊙Lyon The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and Mayor of this city, Herriot, gave a speech here yesterday, roughly stating, "China has now become the target of large-scale aggression, and the massacre of civilians, women, and children occurs constantly. Such violent behavior should not be tolerated. Those who are driven by conscience to protest are ridiculed by shameless people, which we also cannot tolerate. The principles on which human progress should be based have never been destroyed so frequently and violently as they are today. The barbaric act of indiscriminate killing has already become apparent today. There is no distinction made between undefended cities and fortified cities, and civilians and combatants are bombed indiscriminately. Our great French Republic should protest against such dishonorable atrocities. Fortunately, the results of the last few meetings of the League of Nations have given us considerable hope. The Nine-Power Treaty to guarantee China's territorial integrity has also been invoked by the United States. President Roosevelt's denunciation of the terror the world is encountering and the unjustified interference of certain countries in the internal affairs of other countries is satisfactory. The current issue is which is superior, the collective will of a free nation or the private intention of a dictator, and a judgment must be made." (8th Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

### Full Text of U.S. President Roosevelt's Foreign Policy Speech

[Nanjing] Diplomatic circles say that U.S. President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the dedication ceremony of the bridge built in Chicago on October 5. The full text is as follows: I am now here in Chicago and have the opportunity to participate in the dedication ceremony of this important municipal construction, which I find very pleasing. As I traversed the country, I have seen the various results of cooperation between local governments and the central government based on common sense, and from the welcoming sounds and expressions of millions of people, I can see that they have made significant progress in both material and spiritual aspects in recent years. However, when I see the prosperity of our country's rural areas, the prosperity of factories, the development of railways, and our country's happiness, safety, and peace, I cannot help but compare it with other parts of the world, and I find the scenery quite different. It is necessary to know that the American people, under modern conditions, must look beyond the United States for their own future. In my capacity as a responsible representative of this country, I would like to take this opportunity in Chicago, a large inland metropolis, and on this auspicious occasion of the dedication ceremony, to speak to you about a matter of great importance to the country. The recent world political situation has become increasingly dangerous, causing all peace-loving people and countries to feel extremely concerned. Ten years ago, more than sixty countries solemnly pledged not to use force as an instrument of national policy, and humanity's hope for permanent international peace reached its peak. However, this expression, in the noble spirit of the Non-Aggression Pact and the desire for peace, has recently been destroyed by the idea that a great disaster is imminent. The current state of terror and international disregard for the law is but the beginning of a few years ago. At first, it was illegal interference in the internal affairs of other countries, or violations of treaties and aggression against other countries' territories, which has become increasingly serious today, and will seriously threaten the foundations of civilization. All signs and heritages of civilization's evolution toward legal order and public reason have been swept away. Without declaring war, or warning, or reason, many innocent civilians, women, and children have been brutally bombed and killed by the air force. In a so-called state of peace, without reason or notice, numerous ships are being arbitrarily sunk by submarines. Other countries, though not harming us, are inciting and fostering internal strife. While not allowing other countries to interfere in their own internal affairs, they are interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Innocent people and countries are now being brutally sacrificed by those vying for hegemony, who have absolutely no sense of justice or humanity. Recently, a writer said, "We can foresee that if humans are happy to kill, they will run rampant throughout the world, destroying all culture, art, and all the treasures that have survived for thousands of years. The weak, the small, and the defenseless will be wiped out without a trace." If such a situation occurs elsewhere, do not think that the United States can be safe, do not think that the United States can be forgiven, do not think that the Western Hemisphere will not be attacked, do not think that the Western Hemisphere can continue to develop the morals and arts of civilization in a state of peace. If this unfortunate day comes, then force will be unreliable, authority will be useless, science will lose its effect, until all the flowers of culture are trampled upon, and all mankind will fall into a great state of chaos. If we want to avoid the advent of this unfortunate day, if we want to live and work in peace, freedom, and without worry in the world, then all peace-loving countries should rise up and cooperate to maintain the laws and principles that are the foundation of peace. All peace-loving countries should rise up and cooperate to oppose acts that violate treaties and humanity, as such violations of treaties and humanity cause international chaos and instability. It is not possible to avoid the waves of this chaos and instability by strictly adhering to isolation and neutrality. Those who embrace freedom and recognize and respect the equal rights of their neighbors to live in peace must work together to ensure that law and moral principles prevail, and that peace, justice, and trust flourish in the world. In short, it is necessary to trust promises, to trust the value of signed treaties, and to recognize that national morality and private morality are equally important. A certain bishop recently wrote to me, saying, "We should protest on behalf of humanity against the terror of war being inflicted on innocent civilians, especially on infants. The so-called realists may say that this kind of resistance is of no practical use, but in fact, the human spirit is agitated by the current senseless sacrifices and will surely concentrate great power to reduce future cruelty. Even if this collective protest against barbarism takes twenty years to be truly effective, there is no doubt that strong public opinion can accelerate the arrival of this day." Today, the world's technology and morality are intertwined and interdependent. It is impossible for any country to completely isolate itself from economic and political trends, especially when such trends are expanding day by day. If treaties and moral standards are not universally observed by all countries, then neither international peace nor national peace can be stable. International anarchy is sufficient to destroy all foundations of peace and endanger the present or future security of all countries, whether strong or weak. Therefore, restoring the dignity of international treaties and maintaining international morality are matters of great importance and relevance to the American people. Today, the vast majority of people and countries in the world hope to live in a peaceful world. They all hope to eliminate the forces that oppress them. They would rather work hard to produce profitable goods for industry, agriculture, and commerce to increase wealth, and are unwilling to manufacture military aircraft, bombs, machine guns, and cannons to destroy human life and useful property. Countries that are enriching their military purchases in an attempt to engage in aggression, as well as countries that fear foreign aggression and undermine their own security, are now directly wasting a large portion of their national income on armaments, with proportions reaching 30% to 50% of their national income. As for the United States, the annual expenditure on armaments is lower than this, only 11% to 12%. Our current environment allows us to spend money on bridges and highways, on sluices and forest transformation, on soil conservation, and other useful projects, instead of on huge standing armies and war instruments. We are very happy, but I cannot help but feel deeply worried about the future. The peace, freedom, and security of 90% of the world's population are now threatened by the remaining 10% who disrupt the international order and international law. However, these 90% who wish to live in peace according to the law and universally accepted moral principles can find a way, and must find a way to realize their wishes. The situation today is undoubtedly related to the whole world. The issue is not just about a certain provision of a certain treaty being violated, but about the issue of war and peace, the issue of international law, and especially the issue of humanitarian principles. It is indeed a violation of treaties, especially the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Non-Aggression Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, but it is also related to the world economy, world security, and world human problems. The world's moral consciousness must recognize its right to seek a solution for imbalances and well-founded grievances, but at the same time, it should recognize the supreme necessity of respecting the dignity of treaties, valuing the rights and freedoms of other countries, and preventing international aggression. Disregard for the law is like an epidemic, spreading throughout the world without end. Unfortunately, when an epidemic is on the rise, members of society know to approve of isolating patients to protect public health from infection. I am determined to focus on a policy of peace and take appropriate measures to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. In the present world, and with past experience, it is an inconceivable act of folly that there are still countries that violate sacred treaties and invade other countries that have not actually harmed them and are not strong enough to defend themselves, thereby endangering the world by dragging it into war. However, the world's peace, the security and happiness of nations, are now threatened by this folly. A country that cannot restrain itself and does not respect the rights and freedoms of other countries will never be strong for long and will never gain the trust and respect of other countries. A country that handles disputes with a spirit of compromise and can patiently consider the rights of other countries will never lose its dignity or status as a result. War, whether declared or not, has the potential to spread, and even countries and people far from the original theater of war can be involved. Therefore, although we have decided to stay out of the war, we cannot guarantee that we will not be affected by the misfortunes of war, nor can we guarantee that we will not be drawn into the vortex of war. We are now taking necessary measures to reduce the risk of our involvement, but it is difficult for us to have sufficient guarantees in this chaotic world of broken trust and security. If civilization is to continue to exist, the Christian principles of peace must be restored, and the trust between nations that has been broken must be rebuilt. What is even more important is that the peaceful intentions of peace-loving countries must be clearly expressed, so that countries that attempt to violate existing treaties and the rights of other countries will change their behavior and maintain peace. Maintaining peace requires active efforts. The American people hate war and hope for peace, so they are now actively pursuing peace. (7th Central News Agency Telegram)

### Coming and Going in Bombing Raids

— Guo Moruo

Mr. Guo Moruo returned to China on the eve of the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai and was summoned to Nanjing by President Chiang last month on the 19th. This article is a record of Guo Guangsheng's journey between Nanjing and Shanghai during enemy air raids. As the first long article after his return to China, it vividly describes the atrocities of enemy air raids, the wartime capital Nanjing, the military and political authorities, the front lines of Shanghai, Suzhou, and the two elders Zhang (Yilin) and Li (Genyuan).

### Complete Economic Severance with Japan

— Wu Yugan

Our resistance to the brutal Japanese not only relies on military force, but also requires the full implementation of economic resistance. Therefore, in recent days, organizations such as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce have been vigorously advocating economic severance with Japan, and at the same time, people around the world who sympathize with China have been actively advocating the boycott of Japanese goods. This shows that the power of economic resistance is great, no less than that of military force, and has already been recognized by the world.

However, it may be very difficult for people in various countries around the world to truly help us boycott Japanese goods. It should be understood that their declaration of boycotting Japanese loans is originally just to uphold justice and express righteous indignation; if it is truly implemented, they have many vital interests that they must first consider. Last year, didn't various countries in the world boycott Italian goods for Abyssinia and impose economic sanctions on Italy? What was the effect? It should be understood that before the international relations of various countries with Japan fundamentally change, it is very difficult to hope that their boycott of Japanese goods will be effective. Because under normal circumstances, upholding justice cannot overcome one's own economic interests. For example, Japan's important imports of cotton from the United States and India are around 400 million yuan each year. May I ask if they can sacrifice such a large export interest to boycott Japan's large imports of raw silk or cotton cloth? Also, Japan's wool almost entirely comes from Australia. May I ask if Australia can sacrifice its 200 million yuan a year wool business to boycott Japan's imports of cotton cloth and sundries? We only need to see that in the past few days when the League of Nations is meeting, when discussing economic sanctions against Japan, the representatives of the British Empire's colonies are somewhat evasive and dare not offend. It is also possible to imagine the future of international help for China to boycott Japanese goods.

Therefore, to truly boycott Japanese goods, we can only do it ourselves; and we must not only boycott Japanese goods, but also sever all economic relations with Japan in order to achieve the effect of economic resistance. It is very strange that since July 7, when the Lugouqiao Incident launched the war of resistance, it has been a full three months. Why haven't we simultaneously implemented economic resistance and severed all economic relations with Japan? Now, launching economic severance with Japan, in our long-term war of resistance, is not too late; but from now on, it must be thoroughly implemented, and not just treated as a mere formality, in order to have a great effect. We must understand that in the past two or three months, we have not been able to achieve economic severance with Japan. On the one hand, it is because in the areas occupied by Japanese military force, the power of import and export of goods is in their hands; they can use general traitors to help them promote everything and monopolize everything. Naturally, there will also be batches of unscrupulous merchants to collude with the enemy and traffic with them for profit; at the same time, perhaps some people use the restraint of contracts as an excuse, or for the sake of private feelings; so they have to temporarily maintain economic relations with Japan. But now, these things should not be allowed to exist anymore.

What is most important for us now, whether in the war zone or non-war zone, is to be strictly vigilant, use the method of clearing the fields and strengthening the walls, and pay close attention to the activities of traitors and the unintentional actions of ordinary people to aid the enemy. Anyone who sells enemy goods or sells loans to the enemy, or serves the enemy, or has any economic relations with the enemy, should be regarded by the government as colluding with the enemy and punished. Even those banks and stores established by our country in Japan should be closed down and returned to the country to cut off economic ties. Japan relies on our country's commercial and economic interests the most. We can only sever commercial and economic relations with her to give her a major blow. We believe that the current economic severance with Japan needs to achieve at least the following points:

㊀ The customs registers must not have import of Japanese goods and export figures to Japan in the future. If there are any, we should trace the source: who is colluding with the enemy, it is not difficult to find out the truth; even if foreign firms come forward to handle it, it is also possible to indirectly trace clearly to completely eradicate the source. If, like in August, during the Shanghai war, the import of Japanese goods at Jianghai Customs was still more than 7 million gold units, then our bloody war on the front lines would be a waste of effort.

㊁ Japanese goods that have already been imported into the interior should be sealed and not sold. Chambers of commerce and trade associations in various places should urgently implement this matter and must not allow unscrupulous merchants to sell the Japanese goods they have stored under any pretext. They should especially prevent them from disguising themselves and pretending to be goods from other countries, or even pretending to be domestic goods for sale. We know that before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai had reported a large number of Japanese goods to be shipped to various ports downstream of the Yangtze River, so that the water freight of exported ships once reached more than 100,000 yuan, and the huge value of the Japanese goods being sold is even more conceivable. If old Japanese goods are prohibited from being sold, it can prevent unscrupulous merchants from continuing to import Japanese goods. This is also a necessary work for rectifying the source.

㊂ All those who serve in enemy public and private institutions, groups, industrial and commercial firms should withdraw: especially those who serve in enemy merchant ships and warships, whether sailors, stokers, or pilots, should quickly withdraw from the work that they are directly harming the motherland. Our seafarers' union has an unshirkable duty to contact seafarers all over the world to undertake and urge this work. Currently, in various war zones and non-war zones, there are still many people who serve the enemy or keep all kinds of property and equipment, or even have enemy passes to travel in enemy-occupied areas. If these people do not withdraw, they should also be treated as traitors and punished.

㊃ All public and private debts to Japan should be stopped or postponed immediately. A few days ago, while our government was fiercely resisting Japan, it still paid Japan's indemnity debt. This is naturally irreproachable in terms of our government's efforts to maintain credit, but this method of "feeding the bandits" is too dangerous for the future of the war of resistance. Some people suspect that if we do not pay, the enemy will plunder the customs of the occupied areas, and then all tax revenue will be lost. I hope that these speculations are not the truth. Because we are fighting for the reasons of justice, public morality, national survival, and we have already spared no sacrifice, do we still want to benefit from a little bit of tax revenue under enemy occupation? As long as we believe that stopping the payment of enemy debts can strengthen our war of resistance, we should do it without hesitation. This is also a concrete manifestation of the government's and the people's determination to resist Japan.

In short, economic severance must be thoroughly implemented to be effective. This does not entirely depend on the government. What is most important is to hope that chambers of commerce and trade associations in various places will strictly implement it. I am afraid that some unscrupulous merchants with strong financial resources can collude with the enemy or secretly entrust foreign merchants to seek profit and carry out treacherous plans. This requires the government and the people of the whole country to pay attention to and monitor them at any time and impose severe punishments. We hope that this great economic severance with Japan can achieve the greatest unprecedented effect, just like the military war of resistance!

### The Enemy Charges Guanyintang Positions, But is Encircled and Driven Back to Original Defenses

Our Army Outflanks and Annihilates the Enemy Southeast of Guangfu Town; Enemy Attempts to Assault Hejiaxiang Yesterday, but Suffers Crushing Blow; Enemy Attempts Three-Pronged Sneak Crossing of Wenzaobang, But are Completely Annihilated

Central News Agency Correspondent with the Army, 8:30 PM Report: The defensive perimeter of our army near Guanyintang, south of Fudan University in Jiangwan, was breached by attacking enemy forces at 4:00 AM this morning. However, the enemy did not dare to penetrate deeply and was quickly encircled on three sides and attacked on their flanks and rear. After a brief but intense assault, they were repelled, and our original defenses were restored. At the Bajiao Bridge and Guangdong Street, both sides maintain their original positions under strict vigilance. Although there were several skirmishes between outposts, they quickly ceased. However, enemy artillery fire was intense, and several enemy aircraft continuously dropped bombs and strafed with machine guns, but there was no damage to our fortifications or troops. Furthermore, a report from 12:20 AM this morning stated that on the Jiangwan-Zhabei front, there were only a few outpost skirmishes from yesterday morning until evening, and enemy aircraft were active once in the late afternoon. However, sporadic artillery exchanges continued to be heard. At approximately 5:00 AM, two enemy companies, supported by seven tanks, advanced from the Sijing Golf Course towards our Hejiaxiang defensive perimeter near the Municipal Cemetery, launching a fierce assault. It seems the enemy intended to exploit a perceived weakness to break through, but our army had full deployments along the entire line, making their efforts futile. Upon seeing the enemy approach, our forces met them with a crushing blow. Our flat-trajectory guns unleashed their power, destroying one enemy tank and killing over thirty enemy soldiers. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy formed a line and confronted us. At the time of the report, fierce fighting was still ongoing, with the sounds of gunfire and grenades filling the air. However, our positions remained steadfast.

Enemy Attack on Guangfu Town's Southeast Sector Repelled with Heavy Losses

The enemy forces in the Liuhang area have been continuously attacking our Guangfu Town's front and both flanks. After our forces intercepted and repelled them separately, the enemy at the front suffered especially heavy losses, so since the day before yesterday afternoon, the enemy has not dared to come again, instead switching to attacking our flanks, particularly the left flank, attempting to force our army to retreat and coordinate with forces on the southern bank of the Xing River to prevent us from attacking their flanks and rear. However, our army anticipated their plan and stationed significant forces there for careful defense, preventing the enemy from gaining even an inch. At dawn, over a thousand enemy troops advanced towards the Mengjiazhai and Laoluzhai areas southeast of Guangfu. Our army calmly responded, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. In the northeast, the enemy attacked Chenjiazhai at 3:00 AM yesterday. Our army bravely fought back, engaging in several close-quarters battles, ultimately repelling them. When the enemy retreated in disarray, they left behind four machine guns and many other military supplies, all of which we seized.

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 8th Dispatch: In recent days, our army has been fiercely battling the enemy's 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Taiwan Infantry Regiment northwest of Luodian. Our army launched courageous assaults, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Among the enemy corpses, we were able to identify the names of Captain Chinan, Lieutenant Yamaguchi, Lieutenants Nishihara and Arida, and Captain Nisuji, an engineer. Moreover, we found many documents and diaries on the corpses, which reveal a pessimistic outlook on the prospects of the operation. Their morale is evidently low.

Enemy Advances from Dongbaoxing Road but Suffers Heavy Casualties in Our Ambush

Central News Agency: Our correspondent with the army reported at 12:45 PM on the 8th that the enemy forces on North Sichuan Road launched another attack from Dongbaoxing Road on the evening of the 7th. Our forces rose up to intercept and kill them, engaging in fierce street fighting amid heavy rain. By 2:00 AM yesterday, the enemy had retreated in silence. In between, there were two unprecedented artillery duels. Our heavy artillery fire was accurately targeted, and the enemy, after suffering losses, realized that our forces there were well-prepared and there was no room to maneuver. Thus, they changed tactics and, at around 4:00 AM, advanced from the 63rd Garden and the Japanese Cemetery along the eastern bank of Yokohama. At that time, our forward scouts had already advanced past the Bajiao Bridge towards Liuying Road and encountered the enemy. The troops stationed at the Guangdong Middle School also launched an attack along the Shuidian Road and arrived at the same time, ambushing the enemy. At that time, the enemy's artillery units and tanks had been transferred to other locations, so their strength was weak and they were unusually cowardly. Our forces then bravely moved forward and engaged the enemy in close-quarters combat, fighting a bloody battle for three hours, annihilating over ninety enemy soldiers and returning victorious to our positions. As for the Jiangwan area, the day before yesterday and yesterday were both very quiet, as the enemy was focusing all its efforts on trying to break through our Dou Mountain Road and Bajiao Bridge positions and had no energy to attack there. Yesterday morning from 6:00 to 10:00 AM, artillery fire was heard between the two locations, but it was not very intense.

The Enemy Repeatedly Launches Fierce Assaults on Zhabei, But Makes No Progress; Moreover, That Area Consists Entirely of City Streets, Making it Difficult to Attack, So Since the 6th, the Enemy Has Employed New Weapons to Bombard with Artillery, with the Aim of Burning Down Civilian Houses and Threatening Our Army. The First Time the Enemy Employed These, Their Charging Infantry Was Repelled by Our Machine Guns, Rendering it Ineffective. The Enemy Forces Have Recently Repeatedly Employed New and Illegal Weapons, Indicating the Heavy Blows They Have Suffered and the Difficulties They Are Encountering in Their Operations in Shanghai.

Enemy Forces Attempt Sneak Crossings of Wenzaobang, But Are Completely Annihilated in Three-Pronged Encirclement

The Battles Along the Wenzaobang Riverfront, Which Had Abated Slightly the Previous Night (the 7th) Due to Heavy Rain, Fiercely Resumed and Continued Until This Morning. The Situations at the Three Locations are as Follows: ㊀ The Enemy, Who had Crossed the River from Dongyangzhai and Gathered at Yanzhai and Duzhai, Attacked Xuzhai the Previous Night, But Were Intercepted and Killed, With Most of Them Annihilated. This Morning, Their Remnants Were Trapped on the Riverbank, Unable to Advance or Retreat, Appearing Quite Wretched. ㊁ The Enemy Stationed at Zhangjiazhai Was Besieged by Our Army for a Long Time, and Ultimately Remained Trapped and Refused to Come Out. Our Army Then Deployed a Clever Plan, First Ambushing Troops Nearby, Then Feigning a Defeat and Retreat to Lure the Enemy to Pursue. Near Nijiayuan, the Ambushing Troops Rose Up on All Sides and Encircled the Enemy. Fierce Fighting Continued Until This Morning. ㊂ At Tangqiao, Jiangjiazhai, and Weiwan, the Enemy Was Building Bridges to Continuously Reinforce Their Forces. Our Army Saw Them Crossing Midway and Immediately Swept the Area with Machine Gun Fire from Left and Right. Enemy Soldiers Were Hit and Fell Into the Water. Approximately Two Hundred Were Drowned or Killed at That Time.

Central News Agency Correspondent with the Army, 8:30 PM Report: The Enemy Forces on the Northern Bank of the Wenzaobang River, Who Had Attempted a Sneak Crossing near Dongyangzhai the Day Before Yesterday, Numbered Only One or Two Hundred. Just as They Were Deploying Their Positions, They Were Suddenly Fiercely Attacked by Our Forces and Most Were Annihilated. This Morning at Dawn, We Launched Attacks from Yanjiawan and Zhangjiazhai, Finally Forcing the Remaining Enemy Troops to Flee. Many of the Enemy Troops Fell Into the Water in Their Hasty Retreat. A Small Number of Enemy Soldiers Were Salvaging Supplies on the Riverbank When We Swept Them with Machine Gun Fire, Leading to Another Fierce Battle. Near Jiangjiazhai, the Enemy Continued to Attempt Sneak Crossings. We Were Well-Prepared, and as Soon as Some Had Crossed, We Leapt Out and Charged, Striking Over Sixty Enemy Soldiers and Seizing One Light Machine Gun and Multiple Rifles. At That Time, There Were Also Four Small Boats that Had Already Crossed Midway. Our Army Pursued and Heavily Bombarded Them with Artillery and Grenades, Sinking Them. Many Enemy Soldiers Drowned.

Our Army's Heavy Artillery Inflicts Heavy Damage on the Enemy, Who Issues a Threat of Retaliation

The English-language *China Press* reports: This morning (the 8th), a Japanese military spokesman told foreign reporters that the Japanese army had never damaged any foreign property when counter-attacking Chinese artillery positions in Pudong, but as a result of Chinese artillery bombardment of Hongkou last night, it may change its tactics. The Japanese army will take concrete steps to deal with it, and those steps, which do not necessarily constitute retaliation, are currently under consideration. [Translator's Note: The Japanese are positioning their artillery in Hongkou to bombard our army, but object to our army's bombardment of Hongkou. Only the Japanese are brazen enough to voice such absurd reasoning.]

Our army's heavy artillery heavily bombarded enemy warships and enemy military positions in Hongkou and Yangshupu the night before last. The targets were accurately hit, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. In retaliation, the enemy dispatched three aircraft at approximately 8:00 AM yesterday to conduct low-altitude reconnaissance over our positions in Pudong. At the same time, enemy warships in the Huangpu River simultaneously launched a fierce bombardment of Pudong. The loud rumbling shook the surrounding area. To avoid enemy air strikes, we ignored them completely, and the enemy aircraft gained nothing. Moreover, due to the rain, they left in frustration. Although enemy warships in the Huangpu River continued to bombard Pudong randomly and without targets until noon yesterday, at around 4:00 PM, our army's artillery once again displayed its power, and the enemy warships in the Huangpu River hastily retaliated. At around 5:00 PM, the rain stopped, and six enemy aircraft, divided into two groups, once again became active over Pudong. Our side immediately ceased firing, and the enemy aircraft had no choice but to haphazardly drop over twenty bombs in areas such as Lanni Ferry, Yangjia Ferry, and Tangqiao, destroying many civilian houses. The enemy aircraft flew away with a smug sense of accomplishment in the fading light. At 6:35 PM, enemy warships in the Huangpu River once again launched a senseless bombardment of our Pudong positions, firing a total of over fifty shells until 7:20 PM. When our side continued to ignore them, they stopped on their own accord.

Disregarding International Law, the Enemy Actually Employs Poison Gas Shells

Central News Agency: The enemy is constantly attacking northwest of Luodian, and sometimes approaching our army positions at Shi Xianggong. After our army bravely repelled them, the enemy, due to the heavy losses they suffered, are now disregarding international law and repeatedly employing poison gas shells, fully revealing their brutal and vicious nature. According to a responsible statement issued by our military spokesman, the sneeze gas used by the enemy at Beizhouzhai on the 5th was found to contain toxic substances according to the reports from medical and chemical experts. As a result, of the fifty people exposed to the gas, twenty were diagnosed with symptoms of poisoning, and twenty have already died due to a lack of treatment. Six others are severely poisoned and have no hope of survival. The remaining number are not yet conscious, showing the potency of the gas used by the enemy. On the 6th, the enemy again used poison gas southwest of Luodian, causing over twenty of our soldiers to be severely poisoned.

London, 7th, Havas: The Chinese Embassy has just issued a statement saying, "On the evening of the 4th of this month, when Japanese troops attacked the town of Luodian near Shanghai, the Chinese troops resisted calmly and fiercely. The Japanese troops then used poison gas, causing many Chinese soldiers to be killed and wounded. This matter has now been conclusively proven."

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch: Relevant parties have just received a telegram from Shanghai stating that last night, when the enemy attacked our Beizhouzhai positions, they released poison gas, and dozens of our defending soldiers were poisoned. Subsequently, our reinforcement units arrived to counterattack and repelled the enemy. The Beizhouzhai positions are currently still in our hands. Furthermore, it has been discovered that the enemy is using illegal Wimu shells in combat in recent days.

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 8th Dispatch: At 7:00 PM on the 4th of this month, the enemy near Luodian used grenade launchers to fire tear gas at our positions. At dawn on the 5th, they released sneeze gas and asphyxiating gas. Twenty or thirty of our defending soldiers were poisoned, all unconscious, vomiting, and unaware of anything. Over twenty of them have already died from poisoning, and the remaining five or six have been rescued and are no longer in danger.

Our army defended the city, and the artillery fire from both sides was extremely fierce. Later, because a hole was breached in the city wall of Guoxian, Liu Qingkui, the company commander guarding that section, was shot and killed by Commander Wang after he was found to have retreated in fear. This greatly boosted morale. Commander Wang then directed a large-scale counterattack and recaptured the original position.

Aside from several sections of track being destroyed, over ten civilian houses near the railway were destroyed, with dozens killed and wounded. This reporter visited the Sanyuanli Village in the suburbs of the city on the afternoon of the 8th to investigate the areas ravaged by enemy aircraft in the morning.

Current Commentary

### Resistance to the End

— Appropriate

At the same time as the League of Nations took steps to condemn aggressor nations, US President Roosevelt delivered an astonishingly great speech. Subsequently, the US State Department declared Japan an aggressor nation. As a result, global public opinion responded enthusiastically. This unfolding of a favorable international situation is clearly the result of our nation's heroic spirit of resistance. At the same time, it can further ignite our spirit of resistance.

Our China 'possesses unlimited capacity for resistance' and is gaining powerful international support. Victory in the war of resistance can be ensured. The only question is whether our compatriots nationwide can resist to the end.

Chairman Chiang recently expressed his thoughts on President Roosevelt's speech, saying, 'We are currently struggling and will continue to struggle in order to achieve the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, so that we can continue our peaceful construction plan. Our determination to defend ourselves remains consistent. Even if we fight to the last soldier and the last inch of territory, we will not change our original intention in the slightest. We will not stop resisting until justice is established and the sanctity of treaties is restored.'

This powerful statement once again demonstrates to the world that our compatriots nationwide are resolved to resist to the end. Any attempt by the international community to force China down a path of humiliating compromise should be thoroughly eliminated from now on.

### City to Enthusiastically Celebrate National Day Tomorrow

All to celebrate by raising flags in place, and to independently assist by taking practical steps to defeat the enemy

Tomorrow is the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. At this extraordinary time, looking back on the hardships faced by the martyrs in establishing the nation, the significance of commemoration is greatly increased. The City Party Headquarters has therefore formulated commemoration measures. The City Chamber of Commerce has issued a notice to celebrate by raising flags, the Anti-Enemy Association is making every effort to publicize the event, and various groups are setting out to conduct publicity and provide comfort. Details are recorded as follows:

Party Headquarters Formulates Commemoration Measures

The City Party Headquarters issued a notice saying: "For the purpose of notification, the following measures are formulated to celebrate this year's Double Ten National Day commemoration: (1) All agencies, groups, schools, factories, shops, and households in the city shall celebrate by raising flags. (2) Responsible persons of all agencies, groups, and schools shall, at 10:00 AM on this day, lead their subordinates to hold National Day commemorations in their respective locations, and supervise their subordinates to donate to the national salvation public bonds, and to donate comfort funds or relief items (such as cotton clothes, cotton vests, cotton quilts, etc.). Ordinary citizens should also donate according to their conscience. (3) At 12:00 noon on this day, the association will send personnel to lead citizens in chanting 'Long live' three times at the radio station (Long live the Three Principles of the People, Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party, Long live the Republic of China) to express their celebration. It is hoped that all agencies, groups, schools, factories, shops, and citizens in the city will follow these instructions."

Chamber of Commerce Notifies Flag-Raising Celebration

The City Chamber of Commerce issued a notice saying, "October 10 is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Looking back on the hardships of the revolutionary martyrs in establishing the nation, and the heroic courage of the soldiers on the front lines who shed blood to defend the country today, all of our compatriots should increase their devotion to this Double Ten Festival and offer their protection. Therefore, an urgent notice is hereby issued to all factories and shops in the city: on this day, the national flag shall be uniformly raised; all freight trucks, private cars, and rental cars shall also uniformly display the national flag to show the utmost sincerity in cherishing the nation."

Anti-Enemy Association Issues Publicity Outline

The Propaganda Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association yesterday released a publicity outline for the National Day commemoration: (1) The significance of this year's National Day commemoration: A. The united front of the Chinese nation has been strengthened due to the all-out war of resistance. B. 'Supporting the government, trusting the leader, sacrificing everything, and resisting to the end' has become the unanimous position of the people nationwide. C. Regardless of north or south, man or woman, old or young, all are fighting for the freedom and equality of China. D. The old accounts of historical humiliation have begun to be settled in this year's National Day commemoration. E. China's strength in the war of resistance has been fully demonstrated through the unity of the military and the people. F. This year's National Day commemoration marks the starting point for peaceful forces to resist aggressor forces. G. This year's National Day commemoration has closely linked China with peace-loving and just countries and peoples around the world, giving a serious blow to aggressors. H. This year's National Day commemoration has revealed the dawn of China's national rejuvenation. I. This year's National Day commemoration has grasped the future of victory in the war of resistance. J. This year's National Day is a day of commemoration that advances on the blood of revolutionary martyrs. (2) How we commemorate this year's National Day: A. Economic boycott of Japan. B. Encouraging the purchase of national salvation public bonds. C. Comforting the soldiers on the front lines. Finally, it is hoped that all sectors of the city, shops, and residents will uniformly display the national flag on this day to show their celebration. In the past, during each festival holiday, a small number of shops and residents in the concession areas often remained indifferent, as if they were outside the pale of civilization, which was not as it should be. This National Day commemoration, in the midst of the all-out war of resistance, has profound significance and should be unanimously celebrated, so as to eliminate the shortcomings of the past.

Groups Set Out for Publicity and Comfort

The Shanghai Branch of the Relief Association intends to actively publicize the significance of the National Day and national salvation to refugees during this Double Ten Festival. A publicity outline has been drafted and distributed to instructors for compliance.

In addition, the corps's publicity department plans to hold a special broadcasting program on this day.

The Shanghai Association of Mobilized Students for National Salvation has received notification from the Anti-Enemy Support Association to send all its members on the National Day commemoration to carry out publicity, solicit donations, comfort goods, and solicit national salvation public bonds. It is reported that the association has already notified its members separately, and it is scheduled to gather at the Meihua Girls' High School on Carter Road at 8:00 AM on this day to depart.

The Anti-Enemy Support Association of the Chinese Seamen's Union believes that at this time of intense war of resistance, all matters should emphasize practical measures. Therefore, in addition to ordering the special party branch of the Chinese seamen to hold a simple ceremony for the Double Ten Festival, it has decided to expand various effective movements to enrich national strength and assist the front lines.

The Children's Circle Wartime Association has edited and published the third issue of "Chinese Children," published by the Chinese Children's Association, ahead of schedule. It is a 'National Day Special Issue' printed in 60,000 copies and distributed to members to comfort the soldiers on the front lines and the wounded soldiers, providing them with entertainment on the battlefield and in the hospital beds.

The Shanghai Wartime Education Service Corps has decided to carry out a large-scale national salvation movement and publicity campaign tomorrow. The drama group of the corps has decided to choose the drama "Chinese Mother," which is filled with anti-enemy consciousness, and perform it on the streets and in various refugee shelters tomorrow to arouse the anti-enemy emotions of the citizens. In addition, the speech group of the corps has decided to set out for street speeches on this day.

In the past, thanks to the efforts of all members of the media to promote the issue, it aroused attention from all walks of life, who enthusiastically donated to relieve refugees. Now, in response to the letter from the Anti-Enemy Support Association, a systematic overview of the relief work is required. It has now been sent to press and will be distributed for reference. Once the proofreading is accurate, it will be officially released. Mr. Pan asked for corrections and criticisms on the various processes of running the relief effort. The refugees who have been accommodated have all been sent to various places. Most of the refugees remaining in Shanghai are from Jiatai Bao and other places, because the refugees in those places have no homes to return to. The association has provided appropriate education to the young refugees and divided the adult refugees into technical and ordinary categories. Technical workers are given appropriate work, and in addition to assisting in various military works in the rear, ordinary workers are also planning to accept suggestions from various parties and give them the opportunity to reproduce. At the same time, it is hoped that all sectors will contribute opinions on how to deal with refugees for adoption. Subsequently, Qu Shao Yi delivered a speech on behalf of the press.

### British Prime Minister Chamberlain's Speech Responds to the U.S. President's Speech

Cooperating with Each Other, Striving for Peace Appeal, The British Government is Willing to Support it with All its Strength

[London] British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech to the Conservative Party Congress in Scarborough today that President Roosevelt's remarks in Chicago regarding the dignity of treaties not only expressed the confidence of the United States, but also represented the views of Britain. President Roosevelt's remarks were timely, arousing widespread response, and are welcome. In the past, it was generally believed that the United States, the world's strongest country, would always be content with its isolationist policy. However, President Roosevelt now clearly understands that, as he said in Chicago, if the plague that destroys the laws of the world is allowed to spread, no country can escape its infringement. President Roosevelt's statement that it is necessary to restore the credibility of promises and the dignity of treaties represents not only the opinion of the United States, but also the opinion of Britain. The British government is willing to support its call to cooperate with each other in striving for peace with all its strength. At the beginning of his speech, Chamberlain praised Foreign Secretary Eden, saying that none of the government officials worked as hard as Eden. Eden, young and capable, with extremely rich experience, is using his talents and skills to maintain peace and safeguard national interests. The country is fortunate to have such a statesman. Chamberlain then mentioned the wars in China and Spain, saying that it is heartbreaking to use airplanes to bomb non-combatant men, women, children, and infants. However, in the natural indignation caused by this kind of action, one point may be overlooked. What is this point? That is, brutality, barbarism, the death of civilians, hunger, and suffering are inevitable consequences of modern warfare. The true crime against humanity lies in not trying to resolve disputes through peaceful discussion, but in destroying dignified treaties and resorting to force. Speaking of the Far East incident, the League of Nations Assembly has now launched a conference of signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty and other countries with interests in the Far East. After President Roosevelt's speech, there is no doubt that the United States is willing to participate in this conference and discuss with other countries how to stop the Sino-Japanese conflict. It is still too early to say what special actions the British government will take, but its purpose is to restore peace and maintain it. The British government is willing to cooperate with any useful method to achieve this goal. Chamberlain's remarks about China attracted much attention. The Prime Minister then spoke of other things, concluding by saying that the tragedies that China has today have made us understand that our security in avoiding such tragedies is more precious than anything else. (8th Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch)

### Britain and the United States Begin Preliminary Talks on Convening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

[Washington] Britain and the United States began preliminary talks today on the methods for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Undersecretary of State Welles has stated to the British Charge d'Affaires that the United States will definitely participate in the Nine-Power Conference. The location of the meeting should be determined within a few days. The US State Department has not yet announced any resolutions from today's meeting. According to State Department officials, consideration was given to convening a special session of Congress and the US's diplomatic policy towards the Sino-Japanese situation. As for whether the powers will be asked to unanimously declare economic sanctions against Japan, this is still a matter of general speculation. The highest administrative authorities have now denied rumors that the United States intends to greatly increase its military buildup program. (8th Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch)

### Britain, France, and the United States are Negotiating on Convening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

[London] The governments of Britain, France, and the United States are actively engaged in negotiations regarding the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. As far as is generally known, the countries have also considered the issue of inviting non-signatory countries (including Germany and the Soviet Union). (8th Central News Agency Havas Dispatch)

### US President Arrives in Washington

Summons Hull and Others to Discuss the Situation

[Washington] President Roosevelt recently returned to the capital from Hyde Park and immediately summoned Secretary of State Hull, former US representative to the Disarmament Conference Davis, and Undersecretary of State Welles (who had just returned from Europe) to discuss the Far East situation. When meeting with newspaper reporters, the President refused to comment on the international situation. When asked whether the future meeting of the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty would be held in Washington, he did not answer. Secretary of State Hull later told newspaper reporters that he and the President had discussed general international issues. Regarding the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the League of Nations has not yet sent an invitation to the United States, so there is nothing to announce at this time. In addition, State Department Assistant Wilson met with British Charge d'Affaires Mallet in the afternoon to discuss the preparations for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (8th Central News Agency Havas Dispatch)

### British Labour Party Supports Government's Rearmament Program

Passed at General Assembly

[London] At the Bournemouth Labour Party Congress held today, the Executive Committee presented a report on international policy and defense, advocating support for the British rearmament program passed by the previous Trades Union Congress. Former opposition leader Ramsay MacDonald vehemently opposed it, while Lord Ponsonby and one or two other representatives spoke in support. MacDonald, a staunch pacifist, was praised by the representatives for his personal sincerity. Subsequently, former Home Secretary Clynes expressed his views, which can be regarded as the will of the entire Labour Party. Clynes stated that the main purpose of the report was to ensure that when the Labour Party next comes to power, it has a strong military force to defend the country in the current state of the world. This is truly for the benefit of the working class and the entire nation, and the Labour Party cannot remain inactive, only to engage in rearmament after an attack has occurred. The Labour Party dare not decide the danger of fascist countries attacking democratic Britain. Afterwards, the report was put to a vote, with 2,169,000 votes in favor and only 262,000 votes against. Before the vote, the Congress had rejected, by a similar majority, a motion requiring Labour MPs to vote against the defense budget. Finally, Dallas, Chairman of the National Labour Party's Agriculture and Rural Issues Committee, was elected Chairman of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee, replacing Dalton, and Mrs. Gould was elected Vice-Chairman.

### Our Guerrilla Forces Harass Enemy Rear, Enemy Retreats North of Yellow River Cliff Station

Rumor of Flanking Attack by a Certain Unit, Claim of Recovering Dezhou Yesterday

[Jinan] Our guerrilla forces harassed the enemy's rear, and a large number of reinforcements arrived, causing great fear to the enemy. Yesterday, they retreated north of Yellow River Cliff Station. The front line is quiet. Our armored vehicles are stationed north of Pingyuan Station, awaiting orders to advance. (9th, Special Dispatch)

[Jinan] Military News: The remnants of the enemy on the Jinpu Railway are still on the north bank of the Old Yellow River, constantly attacking our positions, but they have all been repelled.

He will consult with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull on all matters. It is reported that they will discuss ways for the United States to participate in the Nine-Power Conference.

### Enemy Recruits Our Compatriots for Military Service through Bribery

Discovered in All Frontline Battles

[Nanjing] According to reports from various sources, the enemy fighting against us on the front lines, in addition to the puppet Manchukuo troops, also includes many of our compatriots. Upon investigation, it was found that the enemy previously used the name of recruiting Chinese laborers to gather unemployed or demobilized soldiers in various places at high prices and send them to the Northeast for organization. This time, they were driven to Shanghai to fight, under strict enemy surveillance. (Central News Agency, 8th)

### A Certain Military Expert Discusses Western Front Operations

Determined to Improve Past Mistakes, Shanxi-North Battles Will Have a New Posture

[Taiyuan] A Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed a certain military expert here to discuss the progress of the Western Front operations. The expert expressed his opinion that since the outbreak of the Western Front battles, our army has always been in a disadvantageous position. The reason for this, as Commander Yan has openly stated, is that the enemy is on the offensive, while our army is on the defensive. Therefore, we are constantly restrained by the enemy, and most of our army's fighting power is consumed in responding, which is a regrettable matter. If our army were to change its position and take the offensive, even if we might not be assured of victory, the enemy would at least have to divide their forces to respond to us, and the situation in northern Shanxi might not be what it is today. The expert continued that the authorities have a deep understanding and awareness of this point, and are determined to improve past mistakes. They have also agreed on a new strategy, and as soon as the newly added troops on the front line are deployed, they will implement it according to the new plan. The battles in northern Shanxi will soon have a new posture, and we can wait and see. (Central News Agency, 8th)

### Enemy Attacks Guangfu Town, Repelled; Fierce Fighting Continues Southwest of Liuhang

Intense Struggle between the Two Armies for the Xiliufangzhai Position; Shixianggong Temple Area Still Held by Our Army; Enemy Remnants Crossing Yunzaobang Trapped in Dire Straits

Once Breached, but Quickly Recaptured by Our Army; Intruded Again Last Night and are Currently Being Blocked; Enemy Attack on Xinmu Bridge Repelled

Southwest of Liuhang, the enemy's 9th Division fiercely attacked our army's Xiliufangzhai position west of Tangqiao Station, attempting to echo the enemy remnants on the south bank of the Yunzaobang. The attack was particularly fierce starting at dawn yesterday. Although under heavy rain, the artillery fire continued all day long, destroying our army's position. Our army calmly responded and firmly defended, but because the position was destroyed too much, it was breached. At noon yesterday, our army's fresh troops arrived and jointly launched a counterattack, advancing in the rain. Although the enemy's artillery fire was dense, our entire army fought bravely, rising one after another. After several hours of bloody battle, the original position was completely restored. In the evening, the defeated enemy, with reinforcements, attacked our army's position again, and the bloody battle resumed. However, the previous fortifications had already been destroyed, making it difficult to defend, so it was breached again for the second time. Our rear troops rushed to intercept and annihilated most of the attacking enemy. Until this morning, the two sides were still in intense fighting, and the struggle was extremely fierce. The intruding enemy is west of Liuhang. On our army's Guangfu Town Xinmu Bridge line of defence a large contingent of enemy troops launched fierce attacks yesterday, with incessant artillery fire throughout the day in the heavy rain, covering their troops' advance. Our army fought bravely, and the attacking enemy was never successful, suffering heavy casualties and collapsing in defeat. This morning, the enemy attempted to attack again, but was still driven away by our army.

A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 12:20 PM on the 9th that the enemy at Heida Huangzhai, west of the highway on the south bank of the Yunzaobang, is currently resisting stubbornly behind the river after being surrounded and attacked by our forces, attempting to prolong their survival. This morning, before dawn, a force suddenly rushed eastward to expand its position, but after our strict blockade, the enemy's plan has been dashed.

### Enemy Remnants' Retreat Route Cut Off

The focus of the battle is currently developing east and west of Liuhang along the Shanghai-Taicang Road Tangqiao. Although the enemy troops who crossed south near Tangqiao have been almost completely annihilated by our forces, the enemy's ambition has not died. Even this morning, despite the rain, they are still constantly building bridges to cross secretly. Our army showed great power in the middle of the night, advancing fiercely on three sides along the bank, completely destroying the enemy's temporary fortifications on the north bank. With their retreat route cut off, the enemy did not dare to continue advancing.

### Enemy Attack on Zhabei Suffers Another Heavy Blow

Repeated Attacks on Baziqiao Sanyili Unsuccessful

The enemy at Huayuanli 63 of North Sichuan Road and the Japanese Cemetery, after attacking our Zhabei positions in the past two days and being routed by our army's ambush, still had not given up their ambition. Yesterday evening, the enemy again launched several attacks on our Baziqiao and Sanyili areas north of the Dongbaoxing Road Railway, all of which were met with a head-on blow from our army. Not only did the stubborn enemy make no progress, but they also suffered heavy casualties. This morning, the two sides continued artillery fire on that front until noon.

The recent battles in the Jiangwan area have been relatively quiet. Since the enemy withdrew their heavy troops from that front, they have only been coveting the Yejia Garden line. Since the evening of the 6th, they have occasionally harassed us. Our army calmly responded, pursuing and killing the enemy as soon as they came. As of press time, there was no sign of the enemy. Also, in the Jiangwan Racecourse area, the enemy occasionally sends small guerrilla units, in groups of ten or more, to drive our Northeastern compatriots to probe our defenses and fortifications. After our army discovered this, they immediately pursued and attacked them. Since last night, with the continuous autumn rain, it has been very quiet.

A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 12:20 PM on the 9th that our army's警戒 line in the Jiangwan area is frequently pushing forward, and is very close to the enemy's positions. The enemy's movements are clearly visible. From last night to this morning, both sides have been lying in wait behind their defenses, constantly firing at each other from within their positions. The sound of gunfire rises and falls intermittently, but there are no fierce battles. There is occasional shelling in the Zhabei area.

A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 12:10 PM on the 9th that at around 3:00 AM this morning (9th), the enemy attacked Yicun, five zhang east of Guangdong Street, with a company. After three hours of intense fighting, the enemy suffered more than 50 casualties and had one tank destroyed, and finally retreated in defeat at around 6:00 AM. Also, two enemy companies, starting at 1:30 AM, reconnoitered our Baziqiao position from Huayuanli 63 and the Japanese Cemetery. Our army divided its forces and ambushed from two directions, inflicting more than 30 casualties on the enemy, and also drove them back at around 4:00 AM.

A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 12:10 PM on the 9th that at 8:00 PM last night, the enemy army attacked our position at Hejiaxiang Municipal Cemetery from the Si Jingqiu Field in Jiangwan. Due to the unfavorable situation, they retreated immediately. Later, at 1:30 AM this morning, they launched a reinforced attack, and after four hours of intense fighting, the enemy suffered more than 120 casualties and had one tank destroyed, and retreated in a disheveled manner.

### Enemy Seizes and Confiscates Private Property

Areas Such as Hongkou in East Shanghai, Loaded into 3,000 Boxes and Shipped Back to Japan

Central News Agency reports that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the property of our residents living in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas of East Shanghai could not be evacuated in time. The enemy not only refused to allow us to move it, but also proceeded to seize and confiscate all of our property. In addition to food and other items that could be used for military purposes being used locally, all of our small industrial machinery, hardware parts, and other metal products in that area were all looted and loaded into more than 3,000 boxes, which were transported to Japan by the enemy transport ship Noiima at around 3:00 PM yesterday (8th).

### Temporary Silence on the Pudong Front

Our Pudong artillery displayed fierce firepower the night before last and yesterday morning, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy's reinforcements. Fearing another bombing by us, the enemy on the other side was extremely panicked. After 7:00 PM last night, the ships in the Huangpu River continued to fire intermittently, reaching two or thirty rounds, and stopped only after seeing no movement. However, every half hour, they would use machine guns to strafe the banks of the Huangpu River to prevent our army from attacking, so the clear sound of machine guns in the Huangpu River could be heard all night long. The state of their panic can be seen from this. Today, from morning to noon, the autumn rain has been incessant, and the entire Pudong front is unusually silent, having entered a state of truce.

### Number of Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in September

### Trivia

—Phase

Today is October 9th. It is the day before the Double Tenth National Day. Originally, today should be spent happily preparing for the celebration. However, this year we are being invaded by the violent Japanese and are in a period of determined resistance. Let's put the celebration aside for now. Let's take the spirit of preparing for National Day and use it to resist the enemy. Let's take the money to prepare for the celebration and use it to resist the enemy.

National Day is like a person's birthday. This year is the 26th, not a round number. And in this extraordinary period, we should naturally keep things simple and economical. We should use the attitude of "lying on firewood and tasting gall" and the spirit of "sleeping on spears and waiting for dawn" to desperately drive the enemy out of our national defense line. It is not too late to have a very glorious and solemn celebration next year.

### A Visit to the Registration Office for Chinese Employees Retiring from Japanese Banks

Having Personally Experienced the Oppression of the Japanese, the Anti-Japanese Sentiment is Even Stronger; Who Doesn't Find it Intolerable to Still Be Employed by the Enemy?

(Special Feature by this Newspaper) After the July 8th Lugou Bridge Incident, Chinese employees of Japanese commercial banks in Shanghai, including Chosen, Taiwan, Seisho, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and major business companies and spinning mills, resigned one after another to show their determination to resist the enemy. According to newspaper reports on August 4th, "more than 260 people have resigned, especially management-level talents." After the outbreak of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, it can be said that all Chinese employees of all Japanese commercial banks, companies, and factories have automatically resigned. Although this number has not been statistically calculated, it must be quite large. So, how are these unemployed people living now? This is something we should pay attention to.

Regarding the unemployed workers of various spinning mills and the retired employees of various Japanese trading companies, formal agencies have been handling registration procedures separately. Now, the "Shanghai Silver and Money Trade Association" is also handling registration procedures for Chinese employees retiring from Japanese banks at No. 542, Lane 5, Xiafei Road (next door to the Paris Grand Theatre). To learn more about the situation, the reporter made a special visit there yesterday.

According to Mr. Shao and Mr. Han, the persons in charge of the association, it is their unshirkable duty to handle the registration of Chinese employees retiring from Japanese banks "for the sake of colleagues" and the future of this war of resistance. However, due to other reasons, the process has been delayed until now. As for the aftercare issues for these retiring employees, after the registration and statistics are completed, a mutual aid and exchange association (name not yet determined) will be temporarily established, and they will jointly discuss all wartime economic issues. Because they have all personally experienced the oppression of the Japanese, their anti-Japanese sentiment must be very high, and their will must be very firm. Moreover, many of them are "management personnel," and they can learn more about Japan's economic situation in Shanghai. Then, they will try to introduce them to jobs—this issue is indeed too difficult, but they will work hard to do it.

In addition to the name, place of origin, age, and contact address, the registration form also includes the following two items: ❶ Name of the original serving bank, address of the original serving bank, whether there is a current job, and when is available; ❷ What special skills do you have, what kind of work do you want to do, how do you hope the association can help, what are your feelings about the original serving bank, and what are your feelings about this war of resistance? When the reporter went there, he happened to meet two Chinese employees retiring from a Japanese bank who were filling out the registration form. They were trainees at a certain Japanese bank, so they had a brief conversation with them.

According to the two of them, since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, all Chinese employees of Mitsubishi and Mitsui have withdrawn. Although Seisho, Taiwan, Chosen, and Sumitomo are still operating as usual, only one or two out of ten Chinese clerks remain. They are all trapped in a dilemma for the sake of livelihood. This situation deserves our pity and sympathy. Therefore, it is imperative to handle the registration. Even if we cannot immediately introduce them to jobs, we need talents everywhere in the long-term war of resistance. Their efforts are known when compatriots who have personally experienced the oppression of the Japanese come to do anti-Japanese work. And I can say with certainty that they—everyone—is willing to do their last bit for the country. Now, these compatriots who have not retired are even lodging in the bank. From this, it can be known that their homes may have been destroyed by artillery fire and have nowhere to live; or they may feel ashamed that they are still employed by the enemy and are unwilling to show their faces. But can they endure this way? Our answer is: "Absolutely not!" And we also sincerely await them to give themselves to the great cause of the nation!

Most of the expenses for Japan's invasion of Shanghai this time are negotiated and paid by Japanese commercial banks, calculated in Shanghai currency, and remitted to Citibank and HSBC. The special affairs expenditure is absolutely confidential, and Chinese employees of course have no way of knowing. Some of the Japanese employees of the Yokohama Specie Bank have been recalled to their country to participate in the Kanazawa Division Detachment to fight in Shanghai. What do these Japanese people, who also love peace with us, think when they are fighting with their lives on the battlefield?

Finally, he also told the reporter that four important Japanese military personnel lived on the upper floor of a certain bank, and Chinese employees were of course absolutely not allowed to go up there.

At a time when the soldiers on the front lines are sacrificing their lives for the country, the people in the rear can actively express their determination to resist the enemy. The final victory of this spirit of military-civilian cooperation will soon be proven by facts. (Ping)

### The People Enthusiastically Console the Wounded Soldiers

Sufficient to Demonstrate the Value of the War of Resistance

The Shanghai Municipal Consolation Committee has established a wounded soldier consolation group at Room 418, Zhonghui Building, Aidoa Road (telephone 85439) to facilitate the people's consolation of the wounded soldiers and to prevent unscrupulous people from taking advantage of the opportunity to inquire about military information. It has also consulted with various wounded soldier hospitals to hire enthusiastic ladies to serve as commissioners, stationed in various hospitals to receive condolences from all walks of life. The number of people who have come to offer condolences and apply for regular visits has been very enthusiastic. The groups that have already offered condolences include the Shanghai Islamic Association, the Drama Circle National Salvation Association, the 12th National Salvation Performing Troupe, and the 13th National Salvation Performing Troupe. The groups scheduled to visit various hospitals tomorrow, National Day, include the Shanghai Municipal Local Association, the Shanghai Municipal Vocational Circle National Salvation Association, the Foreign Firm Chinese Staff Association, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Women's Consolation of Anti-Japanese and Self-Defense Soldiers Association, the Women's Movement Promotion Association, the Chinese Women's Society, the Shanghai Education Circle Wartime Service Corps, the Shanghai University Students' Friendship Association, and Ms. Liu Jun'e and Ms. Hu. This kind of enthusiasm for comforting the wounded soldiers is sufficient to demonstrate the value of the national war of resistance. If the wounded soldiers return to the front line and convey the feelings of the people in the rear, they will surely increase the morale of the front line.

### Westerner Talks About Our Wounded Soldiers Yearning for War News

The North-China Daily News yesterday published a letter from a Westerner, Mr. Stirling, stating that after a foreigner visited one of the Chinese wounded soldier hospitals, he brought news that one of the things the wounded soldiers felt most lacking was news from the front. I believe that many Chinese young ladies in Shanghai, knowing that the wounded soldiers are eager to know the progress of the war on all fronts at any time, will be willing to come out to help. Now, if several copies of newspapers are sent to various hospitals twice a day for the wounded soldiers to read, this kind of sacrifice is not too great. I dare to say that they are still able to take on this task at this time. Translator's note: Although this is a small matter, it is enough to show Mr. Stirling's concern for the lives of our country's loyal and brave soldiers. I hope that the young ladies will immediately take action and not disappoint Mr. Stirling's good intentions in writing the letter.

### Cotton Vests

People from All Regions Enthusiastically Donate

The Shanghai Municipal Consolation Committee recently received 390 cotton vests raised by the town head Huang Zhongqing from all walks of life in Yexie Town, Sixth District, Songjiang County, packed into six large packages, and sent to Shanghai by Jiang Shuisheng and Han Dashi. In addition, Chen Peide, Mrs. Mo Shangqing, and Xinyi Company each donated 100 pieces, and Zhu Gengxin donated 50 pieces. It is now heard that in order to make it easier to collect the quota of one million pieces, if commissioned to produce them in other places, each piece will be charged 6 jiao, 5 fen and 5 li in national currency. If commissioned to handle the donation of first aid kits for the soldiers, each kit will be charged 1 jiao in national currency. They can be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Yu Qiaqing Road in Shanghai, or to the Shanghai Municipal Local Association in the Zhonghui Building on Aidoa Road.

The faculty and staff of Zhengshi Middle School on Shanzhong Road in this city believe that since it is late autumn, the soldiers on the front line should be consoled because they are eating wind and dew and fighting bloody battles. Therefore, the dean of teaching, Yu Xiangsen, initiated the fundraising for cotton vests. With the enthusiastic donations of the faculty and staff, 400 pieces were raised in one day and will soon be entrusted to the local association to be sent to the front. It is heard that many foreign teachers in the school also gladly donated, showing that foreign friends also sympathize with our loyal and brave soldiers.

Since the Shanghai Municipal Consolation Committee launched the fundraising for cotton vests to keep the front-line soldiers warm, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have been sewing and donating them. The entire Chinese staff of the Jardine Matheson Tug & Lighter Company on the Bund in the French Concession specially donated 260 cotton vests, which were delivered to the local association yesterday for transfer. It is hoped that the Chinese staff of other foreign firms in this city will follow suit and donate.

The students of Shanghai Municipal He'an Elementary School initiated saving sugar expenses to save the country after the outbreak of the Sui War, and raised a total of 479 yuan, 7 jiao and 6 fen. When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, it was remitted to the front, but it was unexpectedly rejected and returned. Now, this money will be used to purchase cotton cloth and flowered clothes, which will be brought back by the students and asked their parents to sew 548 cotton vests to be delivered to the Shanghai Municipal Local Association to be transported to the front on Double Tenth to comfort the soldiers and express their respect.

### Famous Courtesans of the Northern District Broadcast Fundraising

Relief, Rescue and Comfort - Initiated by the Zheng Yun Fellowship

Mr. Ji Chun Tang, Mr. Cheng Jian Han, Mr. Wang Zi Xian, and others from the Zheng Yun Fellowship of this city, are now planning to collaborate with the sisters of the Northern District to initiate a broadcast fundraising campaign to provide relief to refugees, rescue wounded soldiers, and comfort the soldiers at the front. The Relief Committee has already approved this initiative. The broadcast date and radio station address will be announced later upon designation. Now, we first publicly announce the names of the enthusiastic and famous courtesans of the Northern District who will participate: Miss 卿卿 Sixth, Miss 卿卿 Seventh, Yue E, Yue Hua, Yin Hua, Ying Hua, Xue Zhu, Xiao Mei Mei, Miao Zhen, Hua Qun Fang, Xin Tan Chun, Wen Juan, Xin Yue, Li 卿, Xiao Chou, Yuan Chun, Ying Xue, Li Xiang Jun, San Mei Mei, Zhen Huan Lü Hong, Zhen Ming Yue, Jin Yu Lou, Qing Mei, Qin Xin, Qin Di, Di Di, Ping Hu Di Di, Li Wen, Qin Fang, Zhang Su Zhen, Miss Wang Jiu, Ma Li Lian, etc. Others who have not yet joined will be announced one day before the broadcast. We hope that all listeners will actively donate and request songs at will. All donations will be handled by personnel dispatched by the Relief Committee. When donating, please specify whether the donation is for relief, rescue, or comfort, so that we can distribute it accordingly.

### Commercial Press Celebrates National Day by Comforting Soldiers

The Commercial Press will, as usual, be closed for one day on National Day. However, as this day falls on a Sunday, according to regulations, a compensatory day off should originally be given on the 11th. However, due to the current national resistance period, and the need to make extra efforts in culture, it has been decided that work will continue as usual on the 11th. All wages that should be compensated to employees for one day will be fully used to comfort the soldiers at the front. The sum of one thousand national currency has already been sent to the Shanghai Comfort Committee today. The balance will be settled when salaries are paid in the future, and any remaining amount will be sent as a supplement. The fact that the company is contributing money and the employees are contributing labor deeply aligns with the meaning of concerted national salvation. All sectors will surely be inspired upon hearing this.

### The Anti-Enemy Association's Design Committee Continues Talent Registration

In order to meet the needs of all sectors, the Design Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association has specifically organized the registration of specialized talents. For a month now, specialized talents from all walks of life have been eagerly registering. Among the registered talents, there are quite a few who have been introduced by the association and found work. Now, in response to the demands for talent from all sectors, the association has decided to continue to organize this registration. A temporary registration office has been set up at No. 142, Lane 3, Ci Hou Nan Li, Hartung Road. The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day.

### Inland Cotton Mills Need Several Thousand Workers

Same treatment as in Shanghai - Can register at the Cotton Mill Workers' Association

The Cotton Mill Workers' National Salvation Association has received requests from factories in various regions, requiring several thousand male and female workers. It is hoped that all male and female workers will quickly register with the association, and then be escorted by the association to work inland. The treatment is the same as in Shanghai. The association will find ways to provide relief to family members. Those who wish to go with the workers are also welcome. Displaced workers in the Eastern Shanghai area can register with the association. The association has a shelter specifically for cotton mill workers. The general headquarters is located at No. 24, Fuxing Village, Lane, Huxi New Stage, the intersection of Laobiesheng Road and Jiaozhou Road. The Eastern District branch is located at No. 37, Sanhe Li, Xiaoshadu Road, Binlang Road.

### Four Points That the Public Should Pay Attention To

— Ya Lu

We can only survive in the War of Resistance, which is something everyone should know. In the Battle of Shanghai, the enemy army not only failed to gain any advantage strategically, but also suffered significant damage from our army. This strengthens our conviction that only through long-term struggle can we achieve final victory. All previous unhealthy mentalities such as hope, reliance, timidity, and fear of Japan should be completely eradicated. Although our public does not yet need to go to the battlefield to kill enemies, in this extraordinary period, the public in the rear should also live a disciplined life like in the army, and work hard in their respective positions to contribute to the country. I believe that at a minimum, the following four points should be implemented:

㊀ Thrift: In normal times, everyone only knows how to consume and lacks the intelligence of new production. Therefore, social extravagance has become a universal trend, which is truly heartbreaking. Now that the country is resisting the enemy, the people should be awakened. Moreover, military supplies and other application materials are very important in the war of resistance. Our public should reduce clothing and food expenses and use the remaining funds to support the country in order to increase the effect of killing the enemy. This is the national salvation spirit that the public should have.

㊁ Diligence: An ancient saying goes, "The people's livelihood has diligence, and diligence will not be lacking." In this long-term struggle, farmers and workers are directly engaged in production, and they should intensify their work to increase production, so that necessary needs are continuously available. Even other indirect production occupations should also be spirited and diligently serve. As for those who have already lost their jobs, they should quickly find opportunities inland. Whether doing labor or farming, there is room for development, and it is especially hoped that groups and organizations will provide them with various conveniences and assistance. In this way, everyone can get the opportunity to be diligent, and the economic structure will definitely be very solid.

㊂ Patience: To demand national survival, considerable sacrifices must be made. Now that the soldiers defending the country have already given their lives on the battlefield, then we, the public, should also endure some mental suffering and material losses. We must know that material losses can be compensated for in the future, but if we become slaves of the enemy, then we will never be able to turn over for generations. Therefore, during wartime, we should all grit our teeth and be extremely patient in order to gain national survival and future happiness.

㊃ Assistance: As the saying goes, "Many hands make light work." A big thing cannot be accomplished by one person, and it must be done with everyone working together with one heart. It is certainly the soldiers' duty to resist the enemy at the front, but it is our public's obligation to provide support in the rear. Because the military and the people can cooperate with each other, we can strengthen morale and consolidate military hearts. As for relief to refugees, development of agriculture and industry, and other work that is beneficial to resisting the enemy, we should all rise up and give play to the spirit of assistance.

The above four points, although they are clichés, I think they are very important in resisting the enemy. Therefore, without avoiding my own insignificance, I hope that everyone will earnestly do them and give the country unlimited prospects. Announcement to Mr. Jing Ming, Yong Jian, and Yi Xiang: Please indicate the mailing address and send it to the Editorial Section of the Shanghai Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps Propaganda Department, No. 178 Tianjin Road, for communication purposes.
