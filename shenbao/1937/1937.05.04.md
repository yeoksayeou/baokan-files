[Nanjing] Wang Jingwei's report at the Central Party Headquarters' Memorial Week on the 3rd was as follows: "Comrades, today I have been instructed by the Standing Committee to report on the work of the past week. The most important aspects are threefold. The first is the amendment of the National Assembly Organization Law and Election Law, the reasons for which have already been explained by the Secretariat and need not be repeated. The second is that recently, several major newspapers in Tokyo have made statements about China that have greatly stimulated our people. Especially on this day of the May Third Movement anniversary, our attitude towards Japan, in a nutshell, is resistance, not rejection. By 'not rejection,' we mean that we have no intention of harming others. By 'resistance,' we mean that since others have harmed us, we cannot but resist. Undoubtedly, our years of diligent work have been to strengthen the country's resistance. An individual without resistance will succumb to illness and die. A country without resistance will not only be conquered by foreign enemies but also face extermination. The focus of all our work today is to strengthen the country's resistance. We should reflect daily on whether our work that day has contributed to strengthening the country's resistance. This applies not only to memorial days but to every day. The third aspect concerns the economic construction plan. Since the Third Plenary Session, Central Committee members have been constantly striving to study, sometimes jointly and sometimes in groups. We cannot yet provide a concrete report, but there is one key point that I would like to take this opportunity to explain. Economic construction concerns society and people's livelihoods. In addition to formulating plans and cultivating technical talent, it also requires a common understanding of economic construction among the people. We have examined the literary and artistic works that have been popular in the country for several years, which have had a considerable impact on thought. We feel that most, almost all, of these works are filled with negative, destructive ideas about the current social economy, with no positive, constructive ideas. They seem to be applying the slogan of literary and artistic writers, 'only pointing out the symptoms, not prescribing the cure.' However, this slogan, if applied excessively, can be dangerous. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood points out a broad path for us in economic construction, which is to use peaceful means to achieve the ultimate goal. It points out that the illness of China's current social economy is poverty, and then prescribes the cure of creating national capital to engage in large-scale industries, while allowing private individuals to operate small and medium-sized industries, with the state providing appropriate protection. Some people think that this method is not thorough enough, believing that the current social economy cannot be built until after thorough destruction. Therefore, they outwardly comply but inwardly oppose Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, still adhering to negative, destructive ideas in their propaganda. This kind of thinking has two levels of error. The first error is misdiagnosing the illness, equating China's poverty with the deeply entrenched private capitalism of European and American countries. The second error is considering destruction too easily and failing to adequately estimate the dangers of destruction. Now, the advanced countries of Europe and America have never stopped thinking of various ways to correct the deeply entrenched private capitalism. Observing the recent economic plans of various countries, they are gradually trending towards state capitalism, which is evident. The advanced countries have already expanded their national power and increased their people's strength, not fearing foreign aggression, and are still so cautious about economic planning. How much more so should our country, which is currently suffering from foreign aggression and facing imminent danger, consider this? Even Japan, in recent years, has been advocating a broad national defense theory by the military, focusing on expanding productive forces while also focusing on improving distribution. This is because since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has been pursuing the advanced countries of Europe and America, engaging in the cultivation and development of private capitalism, which has reached a considerable stage. They cannot but correct the current situation of extreme wealth disparity. However, recently, it has gradually transformed into a narrow national defense theory. Without going into the rights and wrongs, the concern is that if destruction is applied to the current social economy, the country will suffer a period of economic instability, and if taken advantage of by others, it will have no way to maintain its current international position, which is obvious. Japan is currently a country capable of inflicting harm, and its consideration of economic issues is still so cautious. How much more so should our country, which is currently suffering from harm, not think from the perspective of uniting the power of the entire nation, but instead indulge in its views of hating the present and engaging in negative and destructive propaganda, causing all people to perish together? If it is believed that construction is impossible without thorough destruction, then it is also believed that there is only one path to take. However, the world in the last ten or twenty years has clearly told us that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood is not only the path that China must take but also the path that all countries in the world must take. Even the Soviet Union has changed from war communism to the New Economic Policy and then to two five-year plans. Lenin once clearly said in 1923 that if Russia could implement state capitalism, it would already be considered a step towards success. Recent facts prove Lenin's words. Now, some people, fearing the red disaster, treat all Soviet construction with a shake of the head and closed eyes, which is certainly foolish. However, not analyzing and studying the transformation and evolution of Soviet economic construction is also equally inappropriate. From all this, it can be known that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood is indeed the correct solution to world economic problems, and for China, it is especially the right medicine for the disease, the only magic cure for resurrection. If we want to carry out economic construction, we must, based on the Principle of People's Livelihood, arouse a positive spirit and make all the people have a common thought and belief. What we need to study is how to create national capital to engage in large-scale industries and how to protect private capital to engage in small and medium-sized industries. It must be known that the large-scale industries that the state wants to run are already carrying a heavy burden, and it cannot possibly bear the burden of all other small and medium-sized industries. It cannot but allow private capital to operate. If the state does not protect it, then there will be no possibility of growth and development. Since large-scale industries are run by the state, then the essence of capital control has already been grasped. There is also another layer: If China wants to save the country and seek survival today, it cannot but focus on national defense industries, that is, so-called military industries. However, military industries are unproductive. This statement is not to despise military industries, but to use them to guarantee the survival of the country. Although they are unproductive, their effect is greater than production. However, we must not forget that the effect of production is expected from peaceful industries, and when peaceful industries develop, the people's strength develops, and the national strength follows with it, and military industries are naturally like trees with roots and water with sources. Understanding this layer, then it goes without saying that economic construction requires the government and the people to divide labor and cooperate. It is hoped that our literary and artistic writers will understand this meaning and move from a negative and destructive mindset to a positive and constructive mindset, which is of great importance to national economic construction and, at the same time, of great importance to strengthening the country's resistance to save the country and seek survival."

### Essential Understanding for Amending National Assembly Regulations

Chairman Lin's Speech at the National Government Memorial Week

[Nanjing] The National Government held its Memorial Week ceremony on the morning of the 3rd. Attendees included Deng Jiayan, Li Wenfan, Chen Xunyong, Wei Huai, and other officials from the National Government and various Yuan, ministries, and commissions, totaling about 400 people. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and then gave an impromptu speech on "The Essential Understanding of Regulations Regarding the Upcoming National Assembly," the original text of which is as follows:

"The Central Executive Committee resolved at its 42nd meeting to amend the National Assembly Organization Law and the National Assembly Representative Election Law, and also to delete Article 146 of the Draft Constitution. Now, the principles of this amendment have been researched by the Legislative Yuan for legislative technique, and the relevant regulations will be amended accordingly. They can then be submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. The re-election of National Assembly representatives can also be actively promoted to ensure the timely convening of the Assembly. The principles decided upon by the Central Committee this time follow the instructions of the Third Plenary Session in February this year, and were decided after careful consideration and detailed study, with reference to opinions from all sides. A few days ago, the person in charge of the Central Committee issued a statement on the process and spirit of this amendment, which everyone must have seen. Because this is a major political issue, different from the amendment of general regulations, it has attracted great attention from all over the country. Therefore, I am making a special report on it today.

The principles of this amendment can be explained in two points. The first point concerns the National Assembly Organization Law, the most important of which is the revision of the powers of the National Assembly. According to Article 1 of the National Assembly Organization Law, the National Assembly has the power to formulate the constitution and exercise the powers conferred by the constitution. This is now amended to 'The National Assembly formulates the constitution and decides the date of its implementation.' There are several reasons for this amendment. First, because the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, it should be formulated by a specially established body in an impartial position, which can better show the dignity of the constitution. Looking at the process of constitution-making in modern countries, not only is the procedure different from that of general laws, but the organs are also mostly specially established constitutional conferences. Because when the people use revolutionary forces to eliminate reactionary forces and build a new country, they must first decide on the fundamental law of the country. The formulation of this fundamental law is undertaken by a specially convened constitutional conference. For example, after the independence of the thirteen states of the United States, in 1787, commissioners were elected by the states to hold a constitutional convention in Philadelphia. The commissioners selected were mostly the leading politicians of the time. The conference lasted for four months before the draft constitution was completed and submitted to the specially organized temporary national assemblies of the states for agreement. By 1790, the thirteen states had agreed one after another, completing the constitution of the North American Union. The first Republican Constitution of France was also formulated by a specially established constitutional body and passed by a referendum. Therefore, in order to show the dignity and sublimity of the constitution, we should separate the organ that formulates the constitution from the organ that exercises the powers conferred by the constitution, so as not to confuse them. This is the first important reason for the amendment.

Second, since the publication of the draft constitution, all parties believe that the most important thing to study and consider is the chapter on the National Assembly. The National Assembly Organization Law is formulated with reference to the draft constitution, so related problems have also arisen. Because the National Assembly Organization Law stipulates that the National Assembly is a constitution-making body and exists prior to the constitution, it also stipulates that it exercises the powers conferred by the constitution. Before the constitution is formulated, the organ that exercises its powers is stipulated. If the provisions of the constitution are changed in the future, or directly opposed, the powers of the National Assembly will inevitably be affected. Moreover, it is far-fetched in law and time to have a National Assembly that was not produced in accordance with the constitution exercise the powers of the National Assembly stipulated in the constitution. Therefore, the organs that formulate the constitution and exercise constitutional powers should be separated. This is the second important reason for the amendment.

Third, the draft constitution was drafted by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the government. According to the Outline of National Reconstruction, it should be publicized to the people at any time in preparation for adoption and implementation when the time comes. Therefore, it is a natural method for the people to express their opinions on the draft constitution through representatives of the National Assembly. However, the term of the National Assembly is originally shorter by law. During this period, it must not only formulate the constitution, but also exercise the powers of the constitution. I am afraid that the representatives will not have the opportunity to deliberate on the provisions of the draft constitution in a leisurely manner. Therefore, in order to concentrate efforts on formulating the constitution, the organs that formulate the constitution and exercise constitutional powers should be separated. This is the third important reason for the amendment.

Furthermore, Article 23 of the Outline of National Reconstruction stipulates that 'when more than half of the provinces in the country have reached the constitutional period, that is, the period when local autonomy in the whole province is fully established, the National Assembly shall be convened to decide on the constitution and promulgate it.' According to the law, the National Assembly was originally a constitution-making body that existed prior to the constitution. The intention of the Central Government in this amendment is to make every effort to produce a perfect constitution, and after the constitution is promulgated and implemented, to elect representatives to the National Assembly in accordance with the law to exercise the powers conferred by the constitution. As for the change of the alternate executive and supervisory committee members of the Central Committee to ex officio representatives, this is because our party builds the country with the party and governs the country with the party. After the military and political period and the period of political tutelage, we are now preparing to return power to the people. The draft constitution was formulated in accordance with the government's experience in implementing the five-power system. All personnel who bear important political responsibilities should of course be allowed to attend and contribute.

The amendment to the National Assembly Representative Election Law can also be explained in several points. First, in addition to special elections, the provision for the National Government to designate candidates has been deleted. This is because the method of designating candidates stipulated in this election law is likely to cause misunderstandings among the people. Therefore, it was decided to abolish it and allow the people to freely elect the most appropriate representatives from the winners of the primary election in order to promote the spirit of universal suffrage among the people. Second, 240 designated representatives have been added. This is because although elections are a manifestation of public opinion, it is feared that in reality some political talents will still not be elected. Therefore, 240 positions have been set aside for the government to designate in order to make up for the shortcomings of the electoral system. The government will naturally use a sincere and open attitude to recruit experts from all parties and people who have fought for the country and have a good reputation and outstanding achievements to participate in the constitution-making, so that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the fundamental law of the country. This is the government's intention to draw on collective wisdom. As for the designated representatives for special elections, this is because the territory is vast, transportation is inconvenient, and for other special reasons, when elections cannot be held in accordance with the law, the government designates representatives as a last resort.

In summary, it can be seen that the Central Government's amendment to the regulations relating to the National Assembly this time is entirely to adopt the opinions of criticisms from all parties and to adopt the principles of free election and concentration of talents in order to complete the fundamental law of national construction. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said in his speech on the five-power constitution, 'We want to use the five-power constitution as the foundation for building the country. We must have a good constitution in order to establish a truly republican country.' It is hoped that the whole country will understand this instruction, exercise the right to vote carefully with the will of the government, and strive to make a perfect five-power constitution."

### Ministry of Interior Revises Police Uniform Regulations

Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Review; Soon to Be Promulgated and Implemented

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Interior believes that the current police uniform regulations and drawings have been in effect since November 4th of the 17th year of the Republic of China, almost nine years. Now, due to the continuous adjustment of the police organization and the changes in official ranks, the above-mentioned regulations and drawings are difficult to apply. Therefore, it is planned to re-formulate them to meet the needs. However, police uniforms are related to public appearance. They represent the dignity of the country and evoke the respect of the people. It is difficult to be proper without gathering opinions from all sides. The Ministry is aware of this and has instructed the responsible department to send letters to solicit reform opinions from police agencies in various provinces and cities, participate in police uniform styles from around the world, and conduct in-depth research in accordance with the principles of solid and simple materials, solemn and beautiful forms, and national uniformity. A draft of the police uniform regulations, comprising four chapters and thirty-six articles, and thirty drawings have been prepared. The content divides the uniforms into three types: full dress, formal dress, and regular dress, so that regular dress can be worn when performing duties at ordinary times, and formal dress can be worn on ceremonial occasions to show solemnity. Regarding the ranks of officers and police, they are separately stipulated on collar badges, sleeve badges, shoulder badges, and arm badges for easy identification. As for the wearing of police uniforms, the old regulations were limited to general officers and police below the senior level. There was no provision for the highest-ranking official in charge of national police administration, which was inconvenient when inspecting police ceremonies. Therefore, the regulations for special police officers have been explicitly stipulated to respect the system and show solemnity. In addition, due to the vast territory of our country and the different climates in the north and south, the color of the regular uniform has been made flexible for practical implementation. It is reported that the above-mentioned uniform regulations and drawings have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review by the Ministry and will soon be promulgated and implemented.

### On the National Defense Line (II)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shu Di

Twice Passing Through Datong

It was on the way from Shanxi east to Datong.

This area, on the Ping-Sui Railway, is the highest and therefore the coldest region. The shadows of dusk cover everything in a haze. The railway line, like a snake, meanders and lies on the plateau; on both sides stand mountain peaks, of which two and a half trees can barely be seen. In the desolate wilderness, there is not a trace of green; only patches of remaining snow, here and there, remain in the shady places, lining the boundless expanse of gray and white.

Suddenly, the train entered a misty drizzle, mixed with fine ice particles, which rustled on the train skin. The wheels ground out a monotonous and dull sound on the rails: "Glug, glug, glug..." No figures can be seen, no houses can be seen, and no smoke from the chimneys can be seen either. Right, front and back, all are surrounded by boundless desolation. Occasionally, the steam whistle roared. Then, we can immediately see the lambs scurrying around on both sides of the railway, and the shepherds staring at the train with wide eyes, full of surprise. Only then did I suddenly remember: This is the borderland! However, the train flew forward rapidly at a speed of eighty li per hour on this wilderness...

Three hours later, the train arrived at Datong Station.

I followed the porter out of the platform. Outside, along the roadside, were rows of tofu-like wire lanterns. In those clusters of lanterns, there were chaotic shouts: "Here! Here!" "XX Inn! XX Inn!" "Stay at XX Hotel, hey, stay at XX Hotel!"... In the dim yellow light, the shadows of the wires flickered on their thin, yellow chins.

Suddenly, the porter called over a hotel tout. He muttered a few words, and the porter handed him the box. At the same time, he reached out to ask me for money, and with the other hand, poked his own nose and said loudly: "Stay at his place, I guarantee it's the cleanest inn here. If I'm wrong, find me at the station, my name is Liu San."

The tout called two rickshaws. The rickshaw, being pulled on the uneven dirt road, swayed to the east, then to the west. Ten minutes later, we arrived at the inn, half a li away.

"How much money?" the tout asked me.

"Didn't you call the rickshaws? You pay according to the rules."

"It was I who asked you, sir." He bowed and retreated. After a while, he sneaked back in. "Sir, they want two dimes a rickshaw."

"Two dimes for half a li? Nonsense!"

"Yes!" The tout bowed again.

Outside the door in the shadows, the hoarse voices of two rickshaw pullers sounded: "The rule is two dimes, two dimes is even less!" Accompanied by some incomprehensible local dialect, as if complaining. The meaning seemed to be that not a penny could be less. The tout listened to the outside of the door, but his eyes were fixed on me, watching how I would deal with it. I wanted to explain a few words, but my voice was drowned out by the voices outside the door. I felt trapped in something and had no choice but to wave to the tout, as if acknowledging it.

When the tout walked into the courtyard, he shouted in a hoarse voice: "Number XX, the counter will advance four dimes for the rickshaw fare!"

When the towel was wrung out of the oily water and rubbed on my face, there was a greasy feeling, mixed with the smell of coal smoke. The tout, now dressed in a long gown and wearing a top hat, squatted against the wall under the cigarette card of a beautiful woman, watching me wash my face and drink tea... For a long time, he seemed to be waiting for me to order something. I kept sipping tea and pacing, pacing and sipping tea, and then pacing again... Saying nothing, he took the initiative to start a conversation.

"Datong is a small place. In recent years, it's been a little better when gentlemen come to visit Yungang; otherwise, ah, it wouldn't be! Sir, do you think our shop is too dirty? The other places are even worse: there are no electric lights. Are you going to Yungang tomorrow?"

I thought for a moment and said, "Not necessarily."

"If you want to go to Yungang, you'd better book a car tonight."

I considered this question back and forth: Having come here, it would seem a pity not to visit Yungang; however, it would take up another day, and there are many more meaningful things to see in Taiyuan! But then again...

"The only good thing about Datong is the water and soil." The tout interrupted my thoughts, and I had no choice but to listen to him continue. "Sir, if you don't believe me, go into the city and see, the skin is white, and the hair is black. There are very few black-haired people here. Alas...!" He suddenly sighed. "It's just that, ah, the customs are not good: in three families out of five, the men rely on women to make a living. The men here are useless; the women are, there is a saying that goes: 'Laugh at poverty, but don't laugh at prostitution.' As long as they eat and dress well, they don't ask where the money comes from."

He paused, as if waiting for me to say something. However, after being blown by the wind and smoked by the coal gas, I had been having a headache for several days; at this time, it was getting worse. I had no energy to speak, not even the slightest sound.

"Alas...!" He sighed again. "But it's been very strict recently: if they find out, they'll be punished. Currently, the government is repairing roads. If they find out, they'll be fined twenty or ten square stones."

"Fined stones?" Feeling something a bit comical, I couldn't help but laugh.

He explained: "To pave the road, you have to crush the stones, right? If they find out, they'll be fined for crushing ten or twenty square stones, and there are even fines of one hundred square stones! If you can't crush them, you have to pay to hire someone, two dollars per square foot. But our shop is okay, they don't check us."

He looked at me with hopeful eyes, as if waiting for me to order something. My head was throbbing in waves, and I remained silent. Then, he found some more things to talk to me about, asking "where is your home?" and "how old are you this year?" and "did you come out to visit Yungang?" and so on. I ignored him completely, and he determined them one by one himself: "You're a southerner," "probably from Guangdong." "At most, you're only twenty-one or twenty-two to twenty-three or twenty-four years old." "Since you've come to Datong, you definitely want to visit Yungang, right?" Then, he began to discuss the matter of young people going out.

"Young people who go out are all the same! Just like us poor people, also—"

"I suddenly guessed what he meant, and quickly stopped him; I'll go to bed right now."

He stood up as if startled, stepped slowly, and said in his mouth: "Then, sir, don't you want to have some fun?"

When he brought in the quilt, he asked me again. I waved my hand and told him to go out. After going out, he used more force than necessary to slam the door shut with a "bang". In less than a minute, he turned off the electric light with a loud "thwack."

Current Affairs Commentary

### Results of the Japanese General Election

— Yu

The results of the Japanese general election have been revealed. As everyone expected, the pro-government parties have achieved an overwhelming victory. Although the total number of seats for the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties is slightly less than the previous election (the Minseitō lost 26 seats, the Seiyūkai gained 3 seats, for a combined loss of 23 seats), they still hold an absolute majority. In the 466 seats, the Minseitō won 179 seats and the Seiyūkai won 175 seats, for a total of 354 seats, nearly 76% of all seats. On the other hand, the Social Masses Party increased from its original 18 seats to 37 seats, a sudden expansion of more than double, which is more noteworthy. On the other hand, the Showa Kai, known as the backbone of the government and the party, decreased from 24 seats to 19 seats (the Domei News Agency on the 3rd said 18 seats). The semi-governmental Kokumin Domei remains at 11 seats. The ultra-right-wing Toho Kai (the Domei News Agency on the 3rd listed the Toho Kai in the anti-government system, but the facts may not be so) spent a lot of effort, only increasing from 9 seats to 11 seats. Other small fascist parties are even weaker and powerless. For example, the Political Innovation Council, the Kodo Kai, the Meirin Kai, and the Yōsei Kai together have only 8 seats. The total number of seats for all right-wing parties is 49, which is far behind the 391 seats of the three major parties of Seiyūkai, Minseitō, and Social Masses. Moreover, it is said that there were particularly many abstainers in this election, accounting for 26.5% of the voters. This is not, as Kawaharada Kakichi said, entirely due to the voters' indifference to the parties. The main reason may be that some voters, threatened by the fascist forces, want to use a passive attitude to express their dissatisfaction with the political status quo. If the voting is not discounted, then the division of power between the government and the parties may be even more significant.

According to the norms of constitutional government, since the Hayashi cabinet did not win the support of the majority in the election, it should resign and be replaced by a cabinet formed by one of the two parties with the most seats, the Seiyūkai and Minseitō, or by a coalition of the two. However, the reality of Japan's political structure is abnormal, and the special position of the military-fascist is by no means completely subdued. In fact, it is impossible. The so-called revival of the party cabinet is also difficult to talk about. Therefore, regardless of whether the Hayashi cabinet resigns or not, the relative decisive power of fascism in Japanese politics will probably continue to be maintained for some time. However, due to the resentment of the majority of the people, the entire future of Japanese fascism is not considered stable.

Looking at the situation these days, on the one hand, there is electoral infighting, and on the other hand, there is an atmosphere of compromise. Even if the New Party movement is intensified before the convening of the special parliament, it will obviously not have much certainty. Re-dissolving the parliament is not a proper way, because there has already been experience this time. Therefore, it is not impossible for the Hayashi cabinet to make conditional concessions to the political parties. The Tokyo government has now issued a statement on the current situation, stating that the last dissolution of the parliament was for moral correction, and that in the future, if there is the same understanding, any party is willing to cooperate with it. Obviously, this is the government's covert invitation to the political parties. At the same time, according to a Domei News Agency report on the 3rd, the government decided to supplement the full-time cabinet members of the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs within the shortest period of time, and intends to look for suitable figures from the political parties. This also reflects the considerable rise of the compromise movement. As for the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties, although they are openly demanding the total resignation of the Hayashi cabinet, they know that they can only relatively contain fascism and cannot absolutely suppress it. Under certain conditions, it should be possible to agree to a temporary compromise. There are still three or four months before the convening of the special parliament. During this period, whether a temporary compromise can be reached between the two parties can be determined.

### The Lin Cabinet Decides to Cling to Power Despite General Election Failure

Political Parties Condemn as Constitutional Treason, Military Takes Wait-and-See Approach

[Tokyo] On the afternoon of the 3rd, at 0:20, the government, in the form of a prime ministerial statement, issued a declaration clarifying the direction of the Lin Cabinet as follows: It is undeniable that the current domestic and international situation is fraught with difficulties. The way to overcome them is to eliminate complacency, guard against recklessness, and resolutely implement reforms suitable for the times. There is no other way. I, [Lin], bearing the great mandate, organized the cabinet with this belief. In attending the 70th Diet session, the recognition of the Diet's renewal is the foundation for reforming all administrative affairs and a stage for expressing the essence of the Imperial Constitution. After careful consideration, I requested the dissolution of the House of Representatives. Therefore, the previous dissolution was not due to differences between the government's policies and the political parties, but was very clear. Now that the general election has been conducted fairly, what I sincerely expect is that the newly elected members, with a spirit of selfless service to the public, based on the essence of the national polity, will promote the ideals of the founding of the nation and strive for the development of our country's unique constitutional politics. Under a correct understanding of the current situation, they will strive to support the great cause. I also believe that the above expectations are shared by those who are concerned about national affairs. The government is determined to implement policies with sincerity under such beliefs and expectations, to cope with the difficulties of the times, and to carry out various policies that are considered most important. I hope that all citizens will fully understand the government's intentions, unite as a nation, and work together to promote the prosperity of the country. (3rd, D盟电)

[Tokyo] The Minseito Party, Seiyukai Party, and Social Masses Party each issued rebuttals in the form of statements regarding the government's declaration, resolutely demanding that the government immediately resign to apologize to the people. The respective statements are recorded below:

Statement by Sakurai, Secretary-General of the Minseito Party

Reading the government's declaration, it has not slightly changed its self-righteous attitude, listing abstract opinions, using the difficulties of the times as a reason, and telling the members to eliminate selfishness and serve the public, and asking the whole country to unite to advance the country's fortunes. However, the current cabinet is destroying the unity of the whole country by illegally dissolving [the Diet], taking an attitude of provoking the people. The entire nation has expressed its opposition to the current cabinet, but it still does not reflect and remains the same as before. How can the current cabinet be said to have the sincerity of eliminating selfishness and serving the public? If Prime Minister Lin truly has a patriotic heart, then he should retire as soon as possible to plan for a united cabinet that realizes the national will.

Statement by Ando, Secretary-General of the Seiyukai Party

Without the efforts of the political parties, destroying cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties, and resolutely carrying out reckless dissolution, all of these are the government's own doing. Now making such a statement is a constitutional treason that does not understand political responsibility. As a result of the election, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties occupy an absolute majority, and the number of members of the Showakai, which supports the government, has greatly decreased. According to this obvious fact, the government's resignation at this time is a matter of course. Now, violating the public's conscience and deliberately making words to plot, it is completely trampling on the constitution and deceiving the people. Our party resolutely attacks this kind of insidious and inferior government.

Statement by Aso, Secretary-General of the Social Masses Party

Looking at the government's declaration, it is still self-righteous, recognizing others through its own recognition, and merely listing things that have no specific substance. The government's attitude is to abandon innovative policies, abandon broad national defense, and switch to narrow national defense, ignoring the stability of the people's lives. The Lin Cabinet, with this kind of policy direction, should resign to apologize to the people. Issuing a statement to attempt to cling to power means that during the special Diet session, everything abstract will be discarded, and specific policies for innovation will be announced, asking whether or not they are for the masses. Regardless of the government's power or attitude, in view of the party's original mission, the party will implement domestic reforms with its own propositions and move towards stabilizing the people's livelihood. (3rd, D盟电)

[Tokyo] On the 2nd, Army Minister Sugiyama invited Vice Minister Umezu, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Kogu, and others to his official residence to discuss countermeasures for the new political situation that unfolded after the general election. Regarding the future moves of the army, the general direction will proceed according to the following views, in order to achieve the army's desired goals of strengthening national defense and advancing national power:

Whether or not to dissolve the new Diet will depend on how the political parties deal with the government with their understanding of the situation. If the Seiyukai and Minseito parties submit a motion of no confidence at the opening of the special Diet session, taking an attitude of overthrowing the cabinet, and the government also decides to dissolve [the Diet] again, the army's attitude will depend on Prime Minister Lin's determination to implement innovative policies. What the army now eagerly desires is to improve productivity, expand and develop resources, and improve the people's lives, in order to prevent and adjust the obstacles to the implementation of national defense preparedness plans: rising prices and malignant inflation. Therefore, recognizing the integrated and unified development of national policy and establishing "legal" investment to concentrate it on the entire line of national policy should be a concrete means of urgent need. In particular, the realization of the Capital Control Law is absolutely indispensable for implementing the increased national defense budget over the years, and should be realized in conjunction with the adjustment of prices and the balance of the people's burden. The army's attitude towards the Lin Cabinet depends entirely on Prime Minister Lin and Finance Minister Yuki's determination on these specific innovative policies. However, if the government has no active expression of implementing the program of policies and remains hesitant, then the army will resolutely oppose the re-dissolution of the Diet and acknowledge the collapse of the weak cabinet as a last resort.

Regarding the issue of new parties, because it is related to the army's control and morale, it is also of considerable concern. However, it does not intend to provide active assistance to the establishment of a new party, but adopts a bystander attitude. (3rd, D盟电)

### Political Situation in Japan Remains Unstable

Cabinet Meeting Not Entirely Unanimous, Prime Minister Hopes New Members Recognize the Times

[Nanjing] An important cabinet meeting to determine the path of the current cabinet to deal with the post-general election situation was held at the Prime Minister's official residence from 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd. All cabinet ministers, including Prime Minister Lin, attended. First, Interior Minister Kawaharada reported in detail on the results of the current general election. Based on the minister's report, they began to discuss the government's policy for dealing with the political situation in the future. Prime Minister Lin stated that he expects the new members to make efforts with a spirit of selfless service to the public, to strive for the implementation of the great cause under a correct understanding of the current situation, so the government also intends to cope with the situation under this expectation and move towards the eight major policies declared in the past. The cabinet members all expressed their approval of this. Next, the content of the government's statement was discussed. Although two or three cabinet members made high-sounding speeches, the result was a declaration of the contents as reported in the previous telegram. The Prime Minister also explained that he intends to quickly evaluate the full-time civil servants of the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Railways, and Ministry of Colonial Affairs before the middle of this month, and requested the understanding of the cabinet members. The meeting adjourned at 0:20 p.m. (3rd, D盟电)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Lin entered the palace at 11:17 a.m. on the 3rd to meet with His Majesty the Emperor. He presented the government's policy decided at today's cabinet meeting to deal with the political situation in the future and reported the contents of the statement issued by the government. He then answered various questions from the Emperor and withdrew. (3rd, D盟电)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Lin has indicated today his determination to expect the new members' correct understanding of the situation, the unity of the whole country, and the advancement towards overcoming the major situation. The government believes that how the political parties criticize this statement is not worthy of attention at all. A unilateral statement from the government is sufficient. The Prime Minister himself does not intend to visit the leaders of the political parties to ask for cooperation, but quietly waits for the political parties to have a correct understanding of the situation and express fair actions. Therefore, the government will not take an active attitude towards the political parties. That is, regarding the evaluation of the three cabinet members, it will also proceed according to the principle of "seeking talents widely in the world." If there are suitable party members among the political parties, they will be evaluated. However, this is based on talent and is not recognized as a party representative. Therefore, there is no change in the previously established policy. (3rd, D盟电)

[Tokyo] Financial circles believe that the statement is still a unilateral attitude of the government and has not eliminated the political unrest. Therefore, they are still taking a cautious attitude towards the future moves of the political parties and the development of the political situation, as before. That is, the situation in the economic world is still difficult to undergo major changes due to the development of the political situation. However, recently, important issues such as the price problem, exchange rate countermeasures, and even public debt policy are difficult to decide without the establishment of a national policy that is united by the whole country. Therefore, the delay in resolving the above-mentioned problems caused by political unrest is worrying, and the results are worth paying attention to. (3rd, D盟)

### Analysis of General Election Results

[Nanjing] The Ministry of the Interior today announced the number of votes in the April 30 general election, totaling 10,317,237 votes, of which 1,110,739 were invalid. The number of votes obtained by each party is as follows: Minseito Party 3,689,356 votes, Seiyukai Party 3,605,575 votes, Social Masses Party 1,011,802 votes, Showakai 418,367 votes, National Alliance 281,834 votes, Toho Kai 217,656 votes, other small factions 317,231 votes, neutral 664,668 votes. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters)

[Tokyo] As a result of the Japanese general election, the two anti-government parties, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, together won 354 new members, gaining an absolute majority in the new field of the House of Representatives, as generally expected at the beginning. Among them, the Minseito Party had 179 new members, exceeding the Seiyukai by only 4, and still maintained its position as the first party. As for the Social Masses Party, its number has doubled from before, becoming 37, threatening the two major parties and other small factions. Furthermore, based on the results of the election, let us look at the situation of the government and anti-government factions. On the government side, the Showakai, the only party allied with the government, originally had 24 members before the dissolution of the Diet. However, as a result of the re-election, it was reduced by 18 members. The National Alliance, a semi-government party, maintained its original state. Therefore, the number of members of the government faction, including all the small factions, is only about 40. That is, the government army camp has completely retreated. On the anti-government side, the Seiyukai, Minseito, Social Masses, Toho, and other factions together reached more than 400 people, ten times more than the government faction. The future political situation under this situation is more complicated, and its future is worth paying attention to. (3rd, D盟电)

[Tokyo] Among the 48 candidates put forward by various right-wing factions, 8 were elected, namely Akamatsu, Eto, Nakahara, Koike, and Yamazaki of the Political Reform Council, Hirano of the Kodo Kai, Tanaka of the Kansei Kai, and Imai of the Meirin Kai. Although these factions have not yet determined their course of action in the Diet, there is little doubt that they will participate in the Japanist camp. However, with a small number of 8 people, they will continue to carry out independent actions in the Diet. Therefore, it is also unknown whether they will organize a second caucus group with neutral members. The Toho Kai and the National Alliance seem to be in contact with purely neutral members such as Akita, Kita, Tsazaki, and Kazami, and their actions towards the government do not seem to take an absolutely anti-government attitude.

### British Press Ridicules Japan's Cooperation with China Depends on Sincerity

Britain is Willing to Consider Japan's Concrete Suggestions, But Will Not Accept if it Still Uses its Usual Tricks

[London] The Times today published an editorial stating that the results of the Japanese general election are not bright. Although the current situation is not easy to judge with Western concepts, it does not seem to be much different from before the dissolution of the Diet. What people in London are focusing on today is Japan's diplomacy, and the development of the election is secondary. It is widely known that Britain and Japan have been negotiating in London to place the relations between the two countries on a more solid foundation. It is also heard that the negotiations have reached the point where the British government is waiting for the Japanese government to put forward concrete suggestions. If the suggestions are satisfactory, the British government will warmly welcome them. If Japan wants to enhance friendly relations with Britain, the basic issue is to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. Japan now intends to take a more moderate attitude on this issue, which is a welcome sign. Britain is willing to recognize the clear fact of Japan's special position in China, but if Japan tries to consolidate this position by means of the usual practices of the past six years, Britain cannot express sympathy. These methods have not been successful. The policies pursued by the military in the Asian continent, south of the Great Wall, are no longer unusual, but only fail again and again. This not only constantly arouses China's suspicion, but also causes other countries to doubt it because their interests are unduly affected. At the same time, China's internal strength is growing and it is becoming increasingly difficult to subdue. Japanese politicians all know that Japan's progress in the Far East depends on the sincere cooperation between China and Japan. It is time for the extremists in Japan to recognize this. Empty words of goodwill have been heard often. The word "sincerity" has been tarnished and even ridiculed, but what is still needed is this word. The development of China into a strong, friendly, and prosperous country is the first step to solving Japan's internal problems and most of its external problems. Japan alone can greatly contribute to China's development, but in the economic sphere, both China and Japan need the cooperation of friendly countries and countries with interests. Japan's actions have so far had some stubbornness to exclude cooperation. Once Japan's desire for friendship with China is true, the British Empire will give sympathetic assistance, and no one can say that the United States will not rise up to help. The Times concluded that Japan's geographical position and its economic structure are suitable for occupying the lion's share in the Chinese market, but it is not a good idea to win it by the methods of a lion.

[London] The News Chronicle today published an article by diplomatic correspondent Bartlett, saying that Japanese Ambassador to Britain Yoshida may submit suggestions for British-Japanese cooperation in China to the British Foreign Office this week. The growing strength of British, Soviet, and Chinese forces, the failure of Japan's policy towards Mongolia, and the unfavorable results of the Japanese general election for the government have all encouraged the Japanese government to adopt a prudent attitude and promote the friendly policy advocated by Japanese Foreign Minister Sato. The British government will give sympathetic consideration to the proposals submitted by Yoshida. If the suggestions can prove that Japan has changed its attitude towards China, the British government will give a useful reply. All that can be said now is this. In addition to serving as a diplomatic correspondent for the News Chronicle, Bartlett also serves as a reporter for the World Review magazine. The magazine was founded by Bartlett, who is generally regarded as an expert in diplomatic affairs. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters)

[London] The Times Weekly Supplement published a message this morning, saying that after Japan will negotiate with Britain on cooperation in China, diplomatic circles are not surprised. It is also stated that Japanese newspapers have repeatedly published such messages recently, indicating that the negotiations are initiated by the Japanese government. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)

[London] Regarding the news that Britain and Japan will be holding talks in London to enhance their relations, British officials have confirmed it and said that an understanding on what issues should be the basis has not yet been agreed upon. Therefore, the talks that can be conducted at this time are of a preliminary nature. Although the people concerned expressed optimism about the outcome of the talks, they said that Japan must first put forward concrete suggestions and earnestly explain its views on the problems in the Far East.

### Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Talks About the Difficulty of British-Japanese Compromise

Saying That It Will Use the Spirit of Mutual Concession to Strive to Open Up the Sino-Japanese Situation

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato returned to Tokyo from Kyoto this morning and discussed the Sino-Japanese issue with Japanese reporters, saying that the current positions of Britain and Japan in China are exactly the opposite of those in 1926 and 1927. At that time, China was full of anti-British sentiment, and the British government suggested to Japan to jointly send troops to China, but Japan refused. At present, Japan is firmly holding the view of British-Japanese coordination, but it is feared that Britain will not easily express a friendly response. Furthermore, the Chinese authorities seem to be unhappy with the British-Japanese consultations. In short, the compromise between Britain and Japan is extremely difficult. Britain is very willing to join some form of collective security guarantee, but Japan considers it impossible because this move is tantamount to restoring the Nine-Power Treaty. Although any new disputes between China and Japan need to be strictly prevented from happening, it is not a good idea to let the current Sino-Japanese relations go on like this. In the past, Sino-Japanese negotiations have all been initiated by Japan with positive suggestions to China, but at present, some suggestions that China expects from Japan are still lacking. If the current situation is allowed to pass without dealing with it, it is unknown whether some unfortunate events, such as the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, can be repeated in the future. Therefore, Japan must show a positive attitude in the near future to open up the current situation. But in any case, we must abandon our past attitude and proceed with everything in a spirit of mutual concession. For example, Japan assists in cracking down on special trade in North China, and hopes that China will reduce tariffs on Japanese goods. I am convinced that if this is the case, various pending issues can be resolved one by one, and Sino-Japanese relations can be clarified. (Central News Agency, 3rd)

### Nagasaki Elementary School Students to Visit Beijing and Shanghai

Carrying a Mission of Goodwill

⊙Nagasaki It is recognized in Nagasaki Prefecture that the goodwill between China and Japan should start with the goodwill between the children of the two countries. Since the ninth year of Showa, with the support of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, plans have been made to mutually send elementary school student representatives to China and Japan and to hold exhibitions of the achievements of elementary school students in the two countries. Recently, there is a gradual possibility of realization. Therefore, the Nagasaki Prefectural authorities and the City authorities negotiated concrete methods, and as a result, it was decided that 10 male and female students should be selected from the elementary schools in Nagasaki City as student representatives. They will be led by 5 teachers on May 23, take the Nagasaki Maru to China, and visit elementary schools in Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. They will return to the country in early June. After the group returns to the country, the Nagasaki Prefectural authorities will hold an exhibition at Katsuyama Elementary School in Nagasaki in mid-to-late June to display various achievements of elementary school students in China and Japan, such as books, writing, composition, and handicrafts, for general public viewing. At the same time, a Nagasaki City elementary school student conference will be held, inviting students from Overseas Chinese middle and elementary schools to attend. The students who went to China will report on the results of visiting various schools in China, and will perform singing, music, dancing, etc. to help its excitement. It is heard that the authorities intend to invite Nagasaki Mayor Sasai Koichiro to be the head of the delegation of students going to China. (3rd, D盟电)

Bordeaux Residents of the port of Bilbao in northern Spain have now begun to evacuate. The port authorities have taken various measures so that refugees from the port of Bilbao can be settled immediately after they arrive here. Before these refugees land, they will be injected with anti-epidemic serum, and those who are sick will be sent directly to various hospitals for treatment. Other refugees will be provided with food and accommodation by the port authorities after landing, and then sent to various provinces. In addition, the Rochelle port authorities have also taken similar measures to plan for the reception of West National refugees. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas)

[Paris] Spanish rebel leader General Franco has announced on the radio that he does not object to Britain and France rescuing civilians from Bilbao. Therefore, British destroyers and French warships have sailed to locations convenient for protecting refugee ships today. The refugees will probably begin to leave the country tomorrow. Most of the first batch of 30,000 people are children. There are currently 9 British freighters anchored in Bilbao, which will successively transport refugees. Today, a French commercial aircraft carried 200 cans of milk to Suerbo. Refugees fleeing to Saint-Jean-de-Luz are given food, clothing, and medicine and sent to the French interior.

Capital of Hungary: Austrian President Miklas and his wife arrived to pay a visit, scheduled to arrive here tomorrow morning. Observers commented that the fact that German Foreign Minister Neurath is visiting Italy at the same time indicates that Germany and Italy are paying close attention to the talks between Austria and Hungary. The nature of these talks is considered extremely important. However, due to the need for both Austria and Hungary to maintain a cautious attitude toward Germany and Italy, it is unlikely that any communiqué will be issued as a result of the talks. In addition, several Hungarian restorationist newspapers have published articles stating that although Austria and Hungary have been separated for eighteen years, their relationship remains very close in political, economic, and emotional terms. The government newspaper, *Magyar Hírlap*, stated that Austrian President Miklas is one of the most ardent opponents of Marxism. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 2nd)

### The Political Situation After the Japanese General Election

㊀ Victory for the Opposition

Tokyo Dispatch: What impact will the Japanese general election on April 30th have on the future political trends in Japan? Perhaps unexpectedly for the Hayashi Cabinet, or perhaps within their expectations, the overall trend of this general election, with the absolute victory of the two established major parties (the Minseitō and the Seiyūkai), is undeniable. In this election, the Minseitō and Seiyūkai clearly raised the banner of opposition to the government before the national electorate. Therefore, the victory of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai should naturally be seen as a victory for the people's opposition to the government. Under such a victory, the existence of the cabinet is naturally meaningless. According to general constitutional principles, it should announce its resignation without waiting for a special session. However, it has become common sense in Japanese politics that the recent political landscape of Japan cannot be judged by general constitutional principles. Therefore, we are not surprised to hear Duke Konoe Fumimaro say today, "If we resign immediately because the election results are unfavorable to the government, then what is the point of dissolving the Diet? I think there must be some other good move." Prime Minister Hayashi himself has also indicated, "What exactly will happen if the results of the general election are unfavorable to the government? The government has not yet decided."

㊁ Failure of the New Party Movement

In the face of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai's grand triumph and the success of the "proletarian parties," what means will the Hayashi Cabinet use to cope with the special Diet session convened in July? Currently, only the Showakai consciously acts as the government party. As of yesterday (April 22nd), the deadline for candidate registration, the Showakai has submitted only thirty-six candidates. Even if all of them are elected with one hundred percent success, it would not be even one-tenth of the total number of seats that the Minseitō and Seiyūkai are likely to win. It is true that Adachi Kenzō's Kokumin Dōmei and some "neutral" elected candidates will openly support the current cabinet, but even combined, they cannot exceed one hundred seats. The three most right-wing factions in the Diet—Nakanō Seigō's Tōhōkai, Egawa Tōkurō's Seiji Kakumei Kyōgikai, and Tanaka Kōtarō's Yōseikai—have a total of fifty candidates. Even if all of them are elected, they would only account for one-tenth of all Diet members. Moreover, firstly, their rate of election is certain to be very small; secondly, they are not absolutely satisfied with the current situation.

"It doesn't matter. There are still more than three months between the general election and the opening of the special Diet session," some have hinted. This means that the government still has ample time to create a new party and gain a majority in the Diet during the three-month interval.

However, "creating a new party" is easier said than done. We firmly believe that General Hayashi himself has given up hope of creating a new party. Hayashi's visit to Privy Council President Hiranuma Kiichirō and House of Peers President Prince Konoe in the middle of this month, and Hayashi's remarks after the visit, are strong evidence.

Naturally, creating a new party has been a long-standing movement lurking within the right wing and the established parties. It was previously centered on cooperation between the Minseitō and Seiyūkai. At the end of 1931, Adachi Kenzō, Tomita Shinjirō, Kuhara Fusanosuke, Nakanō Seigō, and others were plotting it. At that time (immediately after the September 18th Incident), it was an attempt by financiers who were secretly maneuvering the "gold embargo" to purchase U.S. dollars to realize cash flight. Politically, it manifested as a plan for cooperation between the Minseitō and Seiyūkai to form a coalition cabinet. Thereafter, the movement for mutual cooperation between the Minseitō and Seiyūkai continued intermittently. This was the first stage of the new party movement. After the Hirota Cabinet was formed, although Kuhara's faction in the Seiyūkai declined due to the February 26th Incident, Yamamoto Teijirō's faction and Nakajima Chikuhei's faction continued to plot "innovation." In the Minseitō, Nagai Ryūtarō was generally regarded as the central figure of the new party. In addition, Tomita Kōjirō, Hyō Sun'ichi, Tamo Gikei, and others also had a strong inclination towards a new party. When General Hayashi was about to form a cabinet, it is said that these "midwives" of the new party from the Minseitō and Seiyūkai and House of Peers member Ganmai Rainei gathered with Hayashi at the Arima family residence on several occasions to discuss the matter. Although Nakajima and Nagai refused to join the cabinet because Prime Minister Hayashi (or rather, the military) insisted on the condition of leaving their parties, it is generally accepted that they would not have refused to participate in the cabinet simply because Hayashi was the prime minister if that condition had not been imposed. However, the "punitive dissolution" on March 31st had the effect of placing the Minseitō and Seiyūkai in the position of opposition parties, so the second stage of the new party movement also failed. After the Diet was dissolved, everyone thought that the Hayashi Cabinet was confident about the emergence of a new party. However, after ten days, there was no movement. Two weeks later, we saw Prime Minister Hayashi begin to seek a party leader. When he finally couldn't find one, there were meetings between Akita Kiyoshi, Mochizuki Keisuke, and Adachi Kenzō, and Yamazaki Tatsunosuke and Kodama Hideo joined the Showakai's election campaign. This entire process proves how difficult it is to create a government party.

㊂ Prospects for a New Party After the General Election

If the Hayashi Cabinet creates a new party from the elected Diet members after seeing the results of the general election, it will undoubtedly make the current cabinet a target of public criticism and a source of national resentment, because that can only be achieved by using the most despicable and dirty methods of discord, division, and bribery. Here, we can quote the words of political commentator Mitesaki Tatsuo in an article in the May issue of *Nihon Hyōron* as an observation:

"The government is now, on the one hand, assisting candidates who hope to join the new party, and on the other hand, severely cracking down on and suppressing the established parties' financial networks, while also announcing some new policies in an attempt to win over the people. However, thinking that it can obtain a majority of new party Diet members in this election as a government party is completely hopeless.

Firstly, the government can only attract thirty or forty people from small factions and twenty or thirty people from established parties. Even so, they are of extremely poor quality, nothing more than an unprincipled rabble that is swayed by money and power. A permanent and solid political party will never emerge."

At the very least, if you want to create a new major political party, it is useless unless you take the ground away from the two major established parties. The prerequisite for gaining ground is to win over the majority of the genuinely powerful members of the two parties. But what do the powerful members of the two parties, who are united in their hatred of the enemy, say now? They will not immediately break their promises after the election, reversing the public pledges they made during the election and joining the banner of the new party.

If this cannot be done, then what the government can grasp is nothing more than a pathetic and inferior group of thugs. It seems that the government is currently pouring all its efforts into these people.

㊃ Another Dissolution or a Resignation En Masse

From this perspective, if no unexpected events occur, the special Diet session in July will inevitably see the Minseitō and Seiyūkai, along with the "proletarian parties," use the even stronger opposition sentiment of the vast majority of Diet members to fight the Hayashi Cabinet. Without a doubt, it is generally estimated that the Minseitō and Seiyūkai will certainly propose a motion of no confidence at that time, and if one is proposed, it will certainly be passed. Although the Japanese Constitution does not have a clause stating that the cabinet must resign if the Diet passes a motion of no confidence, this is a common practice in any constitutional country, and it has become a convention in Japan since the collapse of the Itō Hirobumi Cabinet due to this. However, as we said at the beginning, the current political situation in Japan cannot be judged by constitutional principles at all, so even if a motion of no confidence is passed in the special Diet session, the Hayashi Cabinet does not have to retire.

At that time, what is more likely is to announce another dissolution of the Diet. Why?

It is clear that the driving force behind the advancement of the current political situation in Japan is no longer the Diet. The Japanese Diet has no meaning of existence other than passing the government's bills. The only meaning of the general election is to express a kind of passive resistance by the people. The driving force behind politics does not lie in the "pioneers" of politics (as declared by Minister of the Army Sugiyama), but in the military. If it was the military that enabled the Hayashi Cabinet to be established, and if it is the military that dares to boldly dissolve the Diet without a government party, then the force that can bring down the Hayashi Cabinet will not be any power other than the military. However, it is possible that the Hayashi Cabinet feels that it cannot shoulder the heavy responsibilities imposed on the government in the future, or that it resigns itself due to the behind-the-scenes machinations of the military and other schemers. However, that will never be due to a mere motion of no confidence passed by the Diet.

㊄ The End Result is Compromise

However, "another dissolution" is actually probably just a means of intimidation and may not become a reality. From the current government's point of view, another election after another dissolution will absolutely not improve the government's position in the people's minds. From the established parties' point of view, although they believe that as long as the current situation does not change, victory will always be in their hands no matter how many more elections are held, they are worried about one thing: the shortage of election expenses. This is a very interesting problem. Everyone knows that the established parties would collapse without the huge capital of financial tycoons and capitalists, and their base would have been taken away by the proletarian parties long ago. In the past few elections, the Minseitō and Seiyūkai each spent three to four million yuan each time. In the current election, because the government's blockade and vigilance against the established parties' campaign funds are extremely strict, in last year's general election, the Minseitō candidates spent an average of 5,000 yuan each, and the Seiyūkai candidates spent an average of 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. During the Hamaguchi Cabinet, because the Minseitō was in power, each person had an average of 10,000 yuan spent on them, plus secret bribes, totaling 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. In this general election, the Minseitō proposed a total of 264 candidates, and the total campaign amount was only 1 million yuan. Although the Seiyūkai was funded by the four major bosses, Hatoyama, Maeda, Nakajima, and Shimada, each candidate could only spend an average of about 3,000 yuan. The situation was much more desolate. If another election were to be held within a year, they would probably face a serious problem in terms of funds. Therefore, most people who know the inside story of Japanese political parties predict that the most likely development before the opening of the special Diet session is a compromise between the established parties and the Hayashi Cabinet, or at least the same scene as in the 70th Diet session will be repeated in the special Diet session. In short, commentator Kiyosawa Retsu's assessment is correct: "On the surface, the government, political parties, and the military are in a kind of triangular struggle, but there is a general trend moving them together, which is the continuous advancement of fascism."

### Plague Epidemic in Various Parts of Fujian Province

The Provincial Government Has Sent Personnel to Prevent and Eradicate the Disease in Various Regions

Fuzhou Dispatch: In recent days, the plague has been discovered in eight counties in southern Fujian. The epidemic first arrived in Fuqing County, in places such as Zadou, Gaoshan Township, and Longtian, where there were a few patients. Through active rescue and prevention measures, it gradually subsided. There was a plague epidemic in Huangshi, Hushi, and even the Pinghai and Makou areas outside the East Gate of Putian County. The county health bureau's investigation revealed that it was not a genuine plague. Preventative work is actively being conducted. The epidemic has spread most widely in the first and third districts of Hui'an County. There have been many deaths in Liucuo, Guocuo, Sanchuan, Shage, and Fengwei, with approximately one hundred deaths. The plague has also occurred in Minglun Town outside the East Gate of Jinjiang County, with only one death. The plague has occurred in Kengwei, Banqi, Yuye, and Gutou in the first district of Nan'an County. One patient from Hui'an County fled to Xiamen and was detected by the quarantine station. He was detained in the isolation hospital for several days and died. A nurse at the hospital was infected with the plague due to inadequate precautions and also died. It has been determined that the plague epidemic in various regions is bubonic plague, and no cases of pneumonic plague have been discovered. After receiving the report, the provincial government immediately ordered the epidemic prevention committees in various regions to begin free plague prevention injections. At the same time, personnel were sent to Xia Dou and Aotou to begin strict inspection of incoming and outgoing travelers. Long-distance buses in the Hui'an section suspended ticket collection, and Cao Shouli, the chief of the epidemic prevention section of the health department, and technicians and assistants were sent to various regions on the 9th of this month to inspect. On the 20th, the head of the health department, Lu Diwan, led Chief Cao and more than ten epidemic prevention technicians, along with injection medicines and other items, to carry out fire protection and rescue operations. Four epidemic prevention teams were set up in Liucuo Street, Shage Street, and Sanchuan Fengwei in the third district of Hui'an, and another epidemic prevention team was set up in Dongyuan in the first district to implement preventative work and issue plague serum for injections. The total population of Hui'an County is 82,405, requiring 3,108 cylinders of plague serum. The health bureaus and other health agencies in Fuqing, Putian, Jinjiang, and Nan'an counties were supervised and urged to handle the matter responsibly. The Yong'an County New Life Movement Promotion Association issued a notice for preventative purposes, offering a small reward for the purchase of rats at four coins each and flies at one dime per two, in order to eliminate the source of harm. After receiving the report, the Central Health Administration entrusted U.S. Ambassador Johnson to order a large amount of rat poison, calcium cyanide, from the United States for preventing the spread of the plague. The Central Health Laboratory Director Yang Yongnian and a large number of personnel, carrying machinery and vaccines, arrived in Fujian on the morning of the 27th of this month to engage in extermination and protection work in southern Fujian. In addition to the 30,000 yuan that has been approved by the Executive Yuan to be disbursed from the national treasury for prevention and protection expenses, the Quartermaster General's Office has allocated 20,000 yuan, and the provincial government has allocated 20,000 yuan. Furthermore, on the 12th, the provincial government received a report from Haicheng County stating that dead and diseased rats were frequently discovered. Technician Fan Degao and assistants were dispatched, carrying the necessary instruments and drugs, to rush to the site to investigate and eliminate the rats. Yesterday (the 26th), Gao Dengting, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, held a conversation with the county magistrates who participated in this provincial police affairs meeting, informing them of the methods for preventing and controlling the plague. In the future, if plague-stricken counties are discovered, they must pay attention to isolation work and not arbitrarily migrate or circulate to prevent the spread to other regions.

### Promoting Production: Jiangsu Province Promotes Rice Cultivation

Provincial Rice Experiment Station Establishes Rice Implementation Zone

Songjiang Dispatch: Production and construction are the central work for revitalizing rural areas and saving the country from peril. Especially during wartime, there are many supplies and much consumption, and the food problem will inevitably become more serious. It is not enough to actively increase production in advance to achieve self-sufficiency. The government authorities are well aware of this and have specially formulated a production and construction plan by the Construction Department, ordering the Jiangsu Provincial Rice Experiment Station to comply with it and be responsible for the rice crop improvement and promotion of the entire province. Because the station has focused on breeding work in the past few years, the superior rice varieties have not been propagated on a large scale, which is insufficient to meet the needs of the entire province. Therefore, a five-year promotion plan is formulated to proceed in an orderly manner. This year, Songjiang, Wuxian, and Gaoyou counties, where the general and branch locations are located, will be set up as rice promotion implementation zones. Songjiang will promote 15,000 mu of the pure-line rice "No. 261" and selected and propagated "Dwarf Green Variety," "Bais Variety," and "Lugengqing." Wuxian will promote 8,000 mu of the pure-line rice "No. 314." Gaoyou will promote 8,000 mu of selected and propagated "Hongguzi." In other counties, the agricultural promotion institute will import superior rice varieties from the Agricultural College of National Central University, the Jiangsu Provincial Educational College, the Agricultural College of Jinling University, the Agricultural College of Nantong University, the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, and the station to establish demonstration zones with specially contracted farmland ranging from 500 to 2,000 mu to serve as a demonstration and facilitate promotion. Thereafter, in subsequent years, a wave-like approach will be adopted to gradually expand the promotion area, striving to make good varieties and good methods universal throughout the province within five years to achieve the goal of food self-sufficiency. Now that it is the sowing season, farmers in Songjiang, Wuxian, and Gaoyou counties have been repeatedly told by the station's promoters about the significance of rice promotion and the benefits of planting superior rice varieties. They have understood the needs of the current environment and their own interests. They have also seen that the promoted rice varieties are purer and better than the local varieties, and they have actively requested registration from the station or branch locations. Within ten days, the predetermined promotion area has been fully booked. More than 4,800 farming households in the three counties have registered to receive the seeds in recent days. Those who have arrived later have mostly been disappointed due to the limited quantity of rice varieties being promoted. It is planned to carefully select the promoted rice varieties, remove impurities and inferior grains, and collect them in large quantities within the rice promotion implementation zone this year to meet the needs for next year.

### Songjiang

Electricity Price Dispute to Escalate

The electricity price dispute in our county has been deadlocked for ten days, and users are still quite persistent. Although the county government and local figures have mediated, the company has stubbornly insisted on the cost issue, which is far from the users' demands, so the matter has not been resolved. Electricity was uniformly cut off on the 22nd of last month. The various shops and users have recently stopped doing night markets. The bustling area of Zhongshan Road is dark and desolate at night, which is a cause of deep concern for the citizens. On the 23rd, more than a thousand users sent a telegram to the Central Construction Commission, requesting it to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the company's accounts and order a price reduction to maintain public utilities.

### Suzhou

Suspected Bandit Accomplices Arrested

Ke, the director of the second district of the water police, learned that Cao Xiaobai, who previously served as a clerk in the water police district headquarters and now lives at No. 123 Jingde Road, and Qian Gaofan, who previously served as a staff member, were in collusion with bandits and were not unrelated to the major robbery case on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. Therefore, on the 1st, he sent the detective team leader Hui Li and others to lead detectives to arrest the two men and detain them for interrogation. It is reported that many other accomplices have fled after hearing the news, but the district headquarters is still in the process of arresting them. The suspects in this case will be escorted to the Wujiang-Zhejiang Water Police Joint Defense Office for interrogation. It is reported that a former detective was involved in the previous case.

### Wuxi

Physician Attempts Rape Case Opens

Former physician of the county's opium detoxification center, Zheng Fuxi, was charged with attempting to rape a female opium addict undergoing rehabilitation (namely Hua Jinglan). After the court-appointed prosecutor conducted a rigorous investigation and went to the detoxification center for an on-site investigation, the prosecutor determined that Zheng's criminal behavior was verified and filed a public prosecution according to the law. On the 3rd, the case was publicly heard. Prior to the hearing, Judge Zhang Xianxin issued subpoenas to the witnesses who were in the detoxification center with Hua Jinglan. At 2 PM, the witnesses who reported to the court included Qi Hong, a worker at the detoxification center, and female opium addicts Zhou Yinshi, Zhou Zhangshi, Fan Zhoushi, Wang Sunshi, Wang Zhoushi, and six others. Zheng Fuxi was brought from the detention center, looking haggard, and entered the criminal waiting room. At the same time, the bailiffs went to the Security Command to bring Hua Jinglan from the detention center. Hua Jinglan was calm and stated that she had recently contracted malaria, so she walked with difficulty. She requested the court to severely punish Zheng's beastly behavior and sought additional civil compensation for her losses. By 4 PM, hundreds of people had arrived to observe the proceedings. At 4:30 PM, Judge Zhang ascended to the second courtroom to begin the trial. Because the case concerned public morals, spectators were not allowed to attend. The crowd who arrived were all disappointed. First, Zheng Fuxi was brought to the court. His testimony was the same as the testimony in the indictment, and he still insisted that he did not attempt to rape her. Next, Hua Jinglan was brought to the court for questioning. Hua immediately confessed the process of Zheng's attempted rape in the center. She described the events vividly. Then, the witnesses were questioned one by one for four hours before the interrogation was completed. Zheng Fuxi and Hua Jinglan were ordered to be returned to detention. Witnesses Qi Hong, Zhou Yinshi, and Zhou Zhangshi were dismissed. Fan Zhoushi, Wang Sunshi, and Wang Zhoushi were returned to the county government for detention due to their opium cases. During the court session, Zheng Fuxi hired Sun Zuhong as his defense lawyer, and Hua Jinglan was represented by lawyers Li Yaochun and Jiang Gongjian, who provided their services pro bono. It is said that the case still requires further examination and additional witnesses before a final decision can be made.

### Changshu

Opium Offender Substitution Discovered

The First District Commissioner's Office recently discovered that Sun Kangkui, the 27-year-old son of Sun Jiliang, a wealthy household outside the East Gate of the county, was arrested by the county after being reported for smoking opium. The county sent bailiff Zhang Xinheng to arrest Kangkui and bring him to the county in the middle of the night. Afterwards, Sun tried various methods and bribed the anti-opium department with 1,100 yuan to have his younger brother, Kangtai, substitute for him. He went to the hospital for a medical examination, and was told that he was drug free and had no addiction. Later, because the matter was not kept secret, someone complained to the Executive Yuan, which was forwarded to the Second District Commissioner's Office for investigation. The Commissioner's Office sent Sun Yating to Changshu to secretly investigate. The Sun family has admitted to this fact, and Sun Kangkui has changed his name to Fuyuan and obtained an opium permit. The local town guard, Lu Sangu, also confirmed the brother's exchange. Therefore, Zhao Mu, the commissioner currently trying opium cases, and Police Chief Zhang Xinheng have both disappeared.

Tonghai Sericulture Revives

The sericulture industry in the areas of Nanhui and Haimen has declined sharply in recent years. Recently, the Construction Department has actively promoted it, and sericulture guidance centers have been established in Zhangzhishan and other sericulture areas. This spring, the Tonghai counties have distributed a total of 10,000 silkworm egg sheets. The silkworms are currently in good condition.

### Hangzhou

Widespread Torrential Rains Cause Disaster

Continuous spring rains have battered Zhejiang province for the past two weeks. Rivers in the eastern counties of Zhejiang have overflowed, turning low-lying areas into swamps. More than ten counties, including Lanxi, Jinhua, Lishui, Qingyuan, and Shaoxing, have reported disasters to the province, stating that early rice seedlings have become moldy, and wheat and rapeseed crops have suffered significant losses. The spring flower harvest is bound to be significantly reduced. If the weather clears up immediately, farmers may suffer fewer losses in the autumn harvest.

### Transboundary Road Construction and Donation Collection Issue to be Submitted as a Separate Case by Japan

Shanghai Consulate Asks for Instructions to Benefit Japan

According to the Japanese-language Daily News, the draft proposal on the issue of tax collection in the transboundary road construction area concluded between Fessenden and the Municipal Government, which was originally intended to be submitted for discussion by the Municipal Council of the Public Concession on the 21st of last month, was postponed until the next meeting because the chairman still needed to study the case. Later, with the approval of the members of the council, it is scheduled to be submitted at the council meeting to be held at 2:00 pm on the 6th of this month. After receiving the draft proposal from the Public Concession and the Municipal Government, our (referring to Japan) Consul General's Office not only asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions, but also worked hard to study the case itself. Now, a concrete Japanese case has been created and sent to Mr. Fessenden. The content is very secret and difficult to find out. However, the Japanese side has many interests to be resolved on this issue. Now that the Public Concession is in financial difficulty, if the Japanese case can be accommodated, the problem of taking into account Japan's welfare can be easily turned around and a fundamental solution can be expected.

### Japanese Ship Meya Maru Refuses Customs Inspection

Customs Officers Fulfill Their Duties and Forcibly Board the Ship, Discovering Artificial Silk in Quilts

Yesterday morning, the Japanese ship Meya Maru arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Mitsubishi Wharf in Pudong. The Jianghai Customs received a report that the ship was carrying a large number of tax-evading rayon. The customs sent all the baggage room inspectors to the ship for inspection. When they arrived at the ship, the ship refused to allow the inspection team to board. The customs supervisor negotiated with the shipowner to no avail. Fortunately, the wharf was located in the Chinese territory, and the Japanese ruffians did not dare to use force. The inspectors forcibly boarded the ship and searched the cabins, finding twelve quilts, all of which were filled with rayon. They were immediately taken back to the customs for confiscation.

### Imbalance in Customs Duties, Dumping of Rayon Fabrics

Finished Rayon Products are Six Times Cheaper, Requesting Population Tax to be Changed to Ad Valorem Duty

The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Joint Association received a letter from the Yunjin Office yesterday stating, "We respectfully inform you that the national silk market is plagued by smuggling and dumping. Since the work of inspecting private smuggling has been intensified, the trend of smuggling has subsided, but the harm of dumping has become more intense. Because rayon goods are strictly inspected and difficult to import, and official transportation and customs duties are very high, the cost of weaving them into silk products and paying taxes is high. Neighboring countries are cunning and skillful at avoiding this. Therefore, foreign silk products are dumped wildly. According to rayon, each box weighs 200 pounds and is valued at 150 yuan. Levying tax according to quantity, each box is about 290 yuan in legal tender. If the raw materials are woven into goods and taxed ad valorem at 80%, only 120 yuan is required. There is an opportunity to take advantage of this, so a large number of finished products are dumped with all their might. Since January, the silk market has been chaotic. Large and small retail stores in the city are eagerly buying them because they are cheap and easy to sell, which can attract customers. Therefore, inferior goods are spreading quickly, while national silk is stagnating. This is because the customs duties are imbalanced, differing by more than six times. Therefore, this strange phenomenon of the guest taking over the host has occurred. If this continues, the silk weaving industry will have no place to survive, and the livelihoods of millions of workers in the two provinces will be starved to death. If the tax rules are not leveled and revised, how can we save this crisis? We ask your association to convene members of the industry in the two provinces and quickly hold a meeting to elect representatives to go to Beijing to petition, and be sure to change the import tax rate of rayon to ad valorem duty to remedy the imbalance, so that domestic silk merchants and the majority of laborers will not perish under the unequal customs duties and can maintain their existing livelihoods. We are awaiting your urgent orders."

### Shanghai-Hankou Water-Land Intermodal Transport Reduces the Entire Journey by About Two Days

Shanghai-Nanjing and Jiangnan Railways and China Merchants Bureau Cooperate

According to reliable information, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the Jiangnan Railway, and the state-run China Merchants Bureau, in order to facilitate the travel of passengers between Shanghai and Hankou, began to pilot the intermodal transport of passengers by train and ship between Shanghai and Hankou last year. Now that the pilot period has expired, all three parties have agreed to continue to jointly operate. The Shanghai North Station, Wuxian (Suzhou), Wuxi, Wujin (Changzhou), and Zhenjiang West Station of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway are intermodal stations. Zhonghua Gate (Nanjing), Dangtu, Xuancheng, and Xuancheng East Station of the Jiangnan Railway are intermodal stations. Datong, Anqing, Jiujiang Wuxue, and Hankou of the China Merchants Bureau are intermodal ports. The Wuhu riverside station is the connecting station for trains and ships. The intermodal fares are discounted by 21% for first and second class and 11% for third class on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Jiangnan Railways. If you take the Shanghai-Nanjing special express train, you must pay an additional express train surcharge. The special class cabin of the ship is discounted by 25%, the first class cabin is discounted by 20%, and the second, third, and fourth class cabins are discounted by 10%. The validity period of the combined ticket is 10 days. Passengers taking the outbound intermodal transport in Shanghai must contact the inquiry office at the North Station in advance (telephone 46677, 46200, extension 279) to arrange cabin reservations. It is said that since the implementation of this method, passengers between Shanghai and Hankou have found it very convenient. Compared with taking a boat from Shanghai to Hankou or from Hankou to Shanghai, the entire journey can be reduced by about two days.

### Longhai Intermodal Transport is Blocked

More than 7,000 Tons of Goods Piled Up in Lianyungang, No Room on the Wharf, Temporarily Suspending Loading

The northwest has been barren this year, and the people are worried about food shortages. In the past few months, tens of thousands of tons of rice, flour, etc. have been purchased in Shanghai and transported there. At present, there are still about 20,000 tons of wheat flour and thousands of tons of other goods stored in Shanghai, all waiting to be transported to Xi'an. Because the Longhai Railway Bureau has no vehicles available for transfer to Lianyungang, the transfer of goods to the northwest has caused 7,500 tons of goods to be piled up on the wharf in Lianyungang, and there is no room on the wharf. The goods from the northwest to Shanghai and the intermodal goods from Shanghai to Shaanxi and Gansu cannot be unloaded to Laoyao. Yesterday, the person in charge of the intermodal transport department of the state-run China Merchants Bureau said that in addition to the Haixiang ship, which is loading another 2,000 tons of goods to Lianyungang, Lianyungang will not be able to load goods there afterwards, and the intermodal goods of the Longhai Railway will be temporarily blocked.

### Zeng Guangqiong, Business Director of the China Merchants Bureau, Returns to Shanghai from the Philippines

China Opens Up Overseas Routes, the Future is Promising

Zeng Guangqiong, Business Director of the state-run China Merchants Bureau, went to Xiamen in March to preside over the launching ceremony of the Haiheng ship on the Xiamen-Philippines route, and then went to the Philippines with the ship to inspect the economic situation of the overseas Chinese and general commerce. He has now completed his work and returned to Xiamen and then to Shanghai. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency specially visited him yesterday to inquire about his impressions of his trip to the Philippines. According to him, the overseas Chinese welcomed the Haiheng ship because it was a national ship, so the passengers were extremely crowded since the Haiheng started running. However, there was less freight between Xiamen and the Philippines, and passenger transport was the main body. This time, the Haiheng's operation on overseas routes is of a trial nature. After three or six months, it can be expanded according to the business situation. According to the current business, China's opening of overseas routes has promising development prospects. As for the economic situation of the overseas Chinese in the Philippines, it is generally still good. In the past year, with the recovery of the world economy, the commercial situation has also improved.

Once approved by the transportation authorities, operations can begin. The company's goal is to develop air transportation between Europe, Asia, and the Southern continents. Since the Shanghai-Xinjiang route was obstructed by the Xinjiang incident, it has been proceeding towards the southwest to open a new route. Technically, multiple flights of the Rong克斯 large aircraft have been successful. By the end of this month, another new aircraft will be flown from Berlin along this route to China. As for the official opening of the route, it is more difficult due to the many countries involved and the extremely complex situation. However, once the full Ping-Guangdong line resumes operations, the first step will be to deliver mail from Northwest China to Europe via this route in Guangzhou to the Southwest Airlines for transfer to Europe.

### Sichuan River Water Rises Over Five Feet, Yichang-Chongqing Route Open

Yichang Can Reach Chongqing Directly, Accumulated Goods Being Shipped

This year's low water level in the Sichuan River is unprecedented in decades, mainly due to the drought in Sichuan, with no water flowing downstream. As a result, the water level from Yichang to Chongqing was at its lowest, falling below the water level by several inches, causing all Sichuan River steamers to be blocked and unable to navigate. For the sake of transportation and relief, the Minsheng Company opened a three-stage connecting flight method to maintain traffic on the upper Yangtze River. In recent days, there have been several rains in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the Sichuan River water has suddenly risen sharply. Yesterday, the local shipping companies received telegrams from Yichang stating that the Sichuan River water has risen to five feet seven inches, allowing ships with a draft of seven feet to travel directly from Yichang to Chongqing. Minsheng, Taikoo, Nissin, and other shipping companies have all resumed the Shanghai-Chongqing route to facilitate commercial transport. The large quantities of goods accumulated in Yichang and the rice stored in Shashi for relief in Sichuan are being shipped upstream one after another. However, large transport ships are still unable to pass.

### Domestic Rosin's Sales Decline in the Netherlands

Due to Impure Color and Foreign Matter, Manufacturers are Encouraged to Improve Production

The International Trade Bureau sent a letter to various domestic product organizations yesterday stating: "According to the instructions of the Ministry of Industry and the letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Consulate in Surabaya reported that the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Surabaya reported that rosin has a large market in the Dutch East Indies, and Chinese products originally occupied a considerable position here. However, in the past two or three years, they have been overwhelmed by American goods. Although the current market price has risen to about 15 guilders, this refers to American goods. Chinese products are only about 9 guilders. The reason for this is that American goods are transparent and clean, while Chinese products are impure in color and contain foreign matter. In order to restore rights and international trade, the Ministry of Industry should be requested to instruct manufacturers to improve production and compete with American goods." Therefore, rosin is rosin, and the above is true. It is appropriate to submit a written report and request the Ministry of Industry to investigate and instruct manufacturers to improve it. In addition to replying, the Bureau is hereby instructed to instruct manufacturers to improve production and improve quality to increase international trade. In addition to reporting, the association is requested to instruct the relevant manufacturers to comply.

### HSBC Further Reduces Interest Rates, Foreign Banks Initiate More Competition

Facilitating Import and Export Merchants to Order Goods, Business of Chinese Banks Will Be Under Pressure

HSBC Bank has changed its current deposit interest rate to 1% per week from the 1st of this month. From now on, the business of foreign banks will tend to be more competitive. A reporter from China East News Agency learned the details from all parties yesterday, as follows:

Foreign Business Relies on Exchange

The business of various banks in Shanghai, including British HSBC, Great Britain, Mecca Li, American Citibank, Japanese Taiwan, Korea, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, French Sino-French, German National, etc., has always been dominated by international exchange business. Before the unification of the monetary system in China, various banks extended their special power and manipulated the exchange business in Sichuan, Guangdong, the Yangtze River, Pingjin, and other gangs, each occupying one side, and the annual net profit was very high.

Unification of Monetary Policy Damages Foreign Businesses

Since the implementation of the new monetary policy in the winter of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the international exchange of foreign banks has been hindered due to the sharp increase in the international exchange credit of the Bank of China, and the domestic exchange rate has been unified, with only one yuan per hundred yuan charged for near and far exchange rates. Therefore, the business of foreign businesses has been damaged.

Repeatedly Lowering Deposit and Loan Interest Rates

Since May of last year, the market chips in China have suddenly become wider, and foreign exchange chips have become more active. Therefore, HSBC, Mecca Li, Citibank, Taiwan, and other banks have successively revised the deposit interest rates of current accounts to solicit business. Initially, the interest rate on current deposits was reduced from 6% to 5%, and then gradually reduced to 3%, to facilitate overdrafts for import and export merchants. Because the interest rate on production was high, import and export merchants did not hesitate to purchase goods at high interest rates. When the chips were sufficient last year, various gang merchants were unwilling to eat high profits anymore.

Speculation Disappears, No Need for Loans

Also, since last year, the daily speculation amount in international speculation markets such as the Gold Exchange has decreased from tens of millions of yuan to several million yuan, and sometimes even less than one million yuan. The Far East is the only one, after losing its center of gravity in speculation, speculators need to borrow money, and foreign speculators also take out chips to change to the right business.

Another Change in Interest Rates, Chinese Businesses Suffer

Recently, HSBC Bank has reduced the amount of current account deposits for customers to one percent per week from May 1st. It is heard that the loan is to facilitate the overdraft of Chinese and foreign industrial and commercial money merchants, which is one of the reasons for the excess of chips. It is heard that other foreign banks will also follow up to reduce interest rates and compete for foreign exchange business. Chinese banks are in this period, and if they do not compete, their prospects are quite pessimistic.

### Money Industry Association Revises Member Agreement

In the event of an unforeseen event, the public receipt remitted that day must still be remitted in the order of the example, and must not interfere with the rolling number. If the current money has been mutually resolved first, it shall be discussed for change and shall not be returned. Article 7. Interbank transfer of money is also discussed for change. Once the transaction is completed, the money shop transferred in on the same night shall be responsible for any unforeseen events. Article 8.

Customers who need to be guaranteed shall have the guarantor draw up a guarantee form, stating the amount of the guarantee and interest, and adding the words "Guarantor is willing to waive the right of prior litigation defense and the right of search defense." Article 14.

(The book of incoming tickets is filled in with the certified checks that have been exchanged). Article 17. For various bills, if the money shop encounters irregularities, non-compliance with procedures, insufficient funds, or other reasons for returning the bill, it shall fill in the reasons and return the bill to the recipient. The above-mentioned returned bills shall be recorded in the ledger with the bill number, account number, face balance, name of the issuer, reason for returning the bill, and the date of returning the bill for future reference.

If the bills and various transfers have been sent to the issuer or acceptor for selection in advance, they should still be recovered from the issuer or acceptor, or a certificate of non-resolution should be provided and delivered to the recipient. Article 20. This agreement is an agreement between industry members and shall be submitted to the industry association for record. All industry members shall abide by it. Article 21. This agreement may be amended at any time if there are any matters that have not been exhausted. After being passed by the members, it shall still be submitted to the association for record.

### Peach Bloom Causes Jiang River to Surge More Than Ten Feet

Hankou Water Level Suddenly Reaches Over 22 Feet, Customs Houses Open Floodlights

Recently, due to heavy rains in the Yangtze River basin, water flows are discharging, and the Jiang River has surged by more than ten feet. Customs Houses have opened floodlights. A record of the situation is as follows:

Jiang River Surge

The water level of the Yangtze River in Hankou used to be only slightly above ten feet. On the 18th of last month, it was only nine feet. The water levels in Jiujiang, Anqing, etc., were also similar. The water level in Yichang, in the middle reaches, was previously still six inches below zero. Therefore, although the customs had removed the draft restrictions during the shallow water period, it was still difficult for heavy-laden river steamers to navigate. Unexpectedly, due to heavy rains along the Yangtze River, water flows converged, and the river surged sharply. Yesterday, the water level in Hankou suddenly rose to 22 feet 8 inches, Jiujiang rose to 26 feet 8 inches, Anqing rose to 24 feet 3 inches, and Wuhu rose to 15 feet 4 inches. The water level in Yichang also rose from zero to 7 feet 1 inch.

Opening Lights

The above water levels have all surged by more than ten feet. Therefore, the entire Yangtze River waterway is now open. The customs have revoked the previously announced night navigation bans for waterways such as Huoyanshan Jianggaopo, Madang, Daijiazhou, Jianglong Reef, and Heshanggang. At the same time, the draft restriction signs posted in Jiujiang, Anqing, and Wuhu have been removed. As for the floodlights along the waterway, such as at Huangliandang, the customs have also opened them to guide ships and will re-determine navigation facilities based on the development of the flood situation.

The court immediately declared that the defendant had been diagnosed with neurasthenia by forensic doctor Wei Ligong during the adjournment period, but it was very mild. The forensic report was issued to Yan's lawyer and the lawyer appointed to defend the defendant for inspection. Jin denied having a mental illness and expressed dissatisfaction with the forensic doctor's assessment. Judge Qian stated that the victim Yan Duhe's injuries needed to be assessed by the court's forensic doctor, so he ordered the case to be adjourned for another week for further questioning.

### The Notorious Bandit Pan Wanshun Was Found to Be an Escaped Convict

He Readily Admits to the Huzhou Robbery; Another Box Cannon Was Found at Sanjiangkou

Bao Yuxing, the captain of the Fourth Team of the Inland River Water Police Bureau of Zhejiang Province, recently arrested a bandit named Pan Apei in Huzhou. Pan confessed that he had gathered a crowd on the afternoon of April 17th to rob the home of Ma Dexian in Hengjie Township, Wuxing County, Zhejiang, of valuables worth more than 1,000 yuan. He also confessed that an accomplice, Pan Wanshun (also known as "Big Belly Three"), from Jiangbei, was hiding in Shanghai. Captain Bao came to Shanghai and requested the assistance of the Public Concession Criminal Investigation Department in arresting him. Chief Inspector Lu Liankui ordered a secret investigation and learned that Pan was hiding at No. 112 Changan Lane, Yangshupu Road. On the previous day, he led Chinese detectives Liu Shaokui, Wang Chengying, Qian Xianting, and Xie Futang to arrest Pan and his concubine Pan Zhu. Many stolen goods were seized. According to Pan's confession, accomplices Guo Xiaoxizi and Guo Jiang from Jiangbei were arrested at No. 14 Huafu Lane, Xingjiazhai Road. Then, Sun Wengui (also known as "White Hair") from Jiangbei was arrested in a shed on Zhongshan Road. Sun confessed that in addition to the robbery of Ma Dexian's home, he had also robbed five hunting rifles from Shanghai Municipal Council West Detective Mei Sheng and his party hunting in Xi Tang Town, Xiahudang, Wuxing County, last October 24. The rifles were hidden in an empty coffin in the Xu Family Cemetery in Sanjiangkou, Kunshan. The detectives took Sun to recover the original stolen five hunting rifles and two rifles, and 252 bullets, and returned to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated that the defendant Guo Xiaoxizi could not arrive today because he accompanied the police officers to search for four box cannons near Sanjiangkou, Kunshan. It was found that Pan Wan had been sentenced to 18 years in prison by the Songjiang County Court for kidnapping and escaped from prison on December 12th last year. When Sun Wengui was arrested, a silver necklace and two silver bracelets were found on his child, all of which were the original stolen items from Ma Dexian's home. The lawyer requested an adjournment for further questioning. Judge Qian Hongye questioned the two convicts, Pan and Sun. Both confessed to the robbery of Ma Dexian's home, and Pan admitted to the prison break. Judge Qian ordered that the defendants be returned to custody separately and adjourned the hearing for further questioning.

### China Merchants Bureau Adds Two Shallow-Draft River Steamers to the Sichuan River

In order to expand cargo and passenger transportation capacity and attract Sichuan River business, the state-owned China Merchants Bureau is building the new steamer Jinjiang No. 1, which is currently under construction. Recently, two additional shallow-draft river steamers have been added to the Sichuan River to meet the needs after the resumption of Sichuan navigation. It is learned that the construction of these ships is exquisite, and the equipment is complete. They are 164 feet 6 inches long, 29 feet 6 inches wide, and 8 feet 9 inches deep, with a speed of 14 to 15 nautical miles per hour and a load of 315 tons. They are also equipped with an oil tank that can hold 150 tons of oil each time, so that Sichuan Province tung oil can be transported smoothly. There are berths for 12 first-class passengers, 16 second-class passengers, and 48 third-class passengers, totaling 76 people. Sanitary facilities are complete, and a crane is installed, which can lift about 10 tons of cargo at a time, in order to transport railway materials. After launching in the future, the bureau will have three ships traveling back and forth on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The Sichuan River navigation, which has been suspended for several years, will soon be restored. At the same time, Sichuan Province is now building railways, and water and land transportation are developing. However, given the large volume of goods imported and exported in Sichuan now and in the future, adding one ship to the bureau will only be enough to cope with it.

When I (Li refers to herself) was flying on the southwest routes, the weather was extremely bad, and the fog was so thick that I could hardly see the rooftops. In addition, there are many mountains in the southwest, so flying is very difficult, but the responsible personnel of the company are not discouraged by this. They are now planning to open up routes in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Beijing-Guangdong. It is reported that the purpose of Li's visit to Guangdong this time was to find writing materials.

### Nail Industry Banquets Iron Industry, Seeking Assistance

Japanese Merchants Dumping Wire Nails, Chinese Factories Urgently Seek Countermeasures

The Nail Industry Association of this city, including Gongqin, Zhongguo, Wangfu, Huadong, and other factories, stated that recently, a certain Japanese factory, regardless of the actual market demand, has been dumping finished products everywhere, attempting to disrupt the market. To prevent this, they specially hosted a banquet for iron industry colleagues at the Fulai Hotel yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Present were Chen Guisheng, Liu Jinliang, Zhang Haoru, He Xitang, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Iron Industry Association, and more than eighty other members of the iron industry. Huang Jiefu of Gongqin Iron Factory delivered a serious speech based on recent findings, stating that the history of China's industry includes a page on the nail and wire industry, which has been achieved entirely through the hard work and struggle of colleagues. For more than ten years, they have faced storms and setbacks and have not had a single day of peace. Last year, taking advantage of the rising trend of global steel raw materials and the parallel domestic economic construction, the industry began to see a revival. It is a rare opportunity for our colleagues to cultivate strength and make full preparations. At this time, we must not allow any foreign goods to occupy our market and usurp the host's role. Unfortunately, there is now a certain Japanese factory that is taking advantage of manufacturing in China and attempting to seize the nail industry market that we have painstakingly built over more than ten years. Observing their actions, they are using tactics such as price cuts and sweet talk, leaving no stone unturned. Once their plan is successful, the disastrous defeat of our own nail and wire industry is not the only thing to regret. The outflow of national funds, the daily decline of national fortune, and the unemployment panic of those who work in this industry will follow, and the impact will inevitably endanger the foundation of the country. The iron industry and the nail industry are closely related, and the Iron Industry Association holds the lifeline of the national manufacturing industry. It must provide considerable assistance to domestic nail factories under this special situation of unequal treaties. This matter is of great importance and should be discussed openly, and countermeasures should be decided. The proposal was discussed for a long time during the banquet, and everyone expressed their support for Chinese nail factories. The specific plan will be to convene a formal joint meeting of the large and small iron industry associations within days to discuss everything.

### Longhua Temple Candle Oil Lawsuit

Although the two parties have reached an out-of-court settlement, the criminal lawsuit cannot be withdrawn.

The monk Xinghui of Longhua Temple, also known as Qin Xingjia, is in charge of the temple's finances. He claimed to Gao Chengde, a merchant, on November 8th of last year that he had seventy dan of candle oil, priced at nine yuan per dan, and that Gao would have priority in picking up the goods during the incense festival in March of this year. Gao believed that the remaining candle oil in the temple only needed to be reprocessed to still fetch a good price, so he paid 350 national currency. However, he was unable to pick up the oil in full when the time came, so he took Xinghui to the police station, who transferred him to the local court's prosecutor. After investigation, it was determined to be purely a trade dispute, so it was decided not to prosecute. However, after accepting the decision not to prosecute, Gao Chengde filed a private criminal suit in the criminal court against Xinghui, the former abbot Yuanming (who resigned after fighting with merchants Wu Rugui, etc.), and the monk Fangcheng for joint fraud. He claimed that they used fraudulent tactics to falsely claim that he had priority in picking up the goods during the incense festival and claimed that the monks in the temple were so poor that they had no rice to cook, requesting an advance payment of 250 national currency, which the plaintiff paid in full. A contract for the goods was signed and receipts were held. On the first day of March this year, the plaintiff rushed from the countryside to Shanghai to pick up the goods, only to find that all of them had been pledged to Hengjinfu Yang Liansheng and others before November 8th, receiving more than 1,000 yuan to offset the debts of Juxingcheng Bank. The monks of the temple divided the remaining candle ends and gave them to three households, like promising one daughter to three families. There were no goods to deliver at all, just castles in the air. After the plaintiff came to Shanghai from the countryside, he lived in a remote inn, and repeatedly went to the temple to negotiate, but the abbot disappeared, and Xinghui also hid in a lodging in the concession, and Fangcheng also avoided meeting him, so he asked them to be punished for fraud. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Qing opened the court. The defendant, through lawyer Liu Xiang, presented the original decision not to prosecute, arguing that the case should not be tried twice. However, the plaintiffs claimed that they had reached an out-of-court settlement and requested to withdraw the lawsuit. The court ruled that the case was not one that could be resolved through private prosecution and did not allow the withdrawal. The case was adjourned for further hearing.

### Commander Yang's Car Damaged by a Truck

The driver was injured.

After finishing, he took Yang's own car, number 2594, to the court for work. After arriving at the court, Yang's driver was turning the car around when it was unexpectedly hit by a truck coming from the side road at the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and Lafayette Road. The front of Yang's car and the engine were completely damaged, and the driver was also injured. The patrolmen on duty saw this and sent the injured driver to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, they took the truck driver who caused the accident and the damaged car back to the police station for investigation.

### Counterfeit Coin Case Results in Punishment

Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective chief, and Yang Xinzheng, a detective, of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, learned on the afternoon of the 1st of last month at 8:00 PM that Pan Wenbao, a Pudong native, residing at 149 East Jiaxing Road, was hiding and manufacturing counterfeit nine-yuan coins of the Bank of China. They secretly went to the address and arrested Pan, confiscating a large sheet of white paper on which twelve single-sided five-yuan banknotes of the bank had already been printed. Upon questioning, it was learned that Qian Yongfu, a runner of the Xiesheng Printing Shop at 143 Hujiabang, Zhabei, had hired him to sell them on commission. The detectives rushed to the shop to arrest Qian but did not find him, only finding a roll of similar white paper. Together with the suspect, Jin Gurong, a native of Changzhou, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Jin hired lawyers Qian Xingzhong and Ma Leming to defend him. Judge Xiao presided over the trial yesterday and ruled that Pan Wenbao be sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, while Jin was acquitted.

### Fang Xiong Arrested for Fraud

Fang Xiong, a Ningbo native residing at 1935 Avenue Edward VII, is 28 years old. He was acquainted with Shen Zaikang, a student at the Nanyang Wireless Telegraphy Training School on Rue du Consulat. Recently, Fang lost his job and had a whimsical idea. On the morning of the 12th of last month, he went to the Nanyang Wireless Telegraphy Training School with Shen and falsely claimed to the students Liu Jingqiu, Du Zhaoyi, Deng Yaozhong, Dong Weihua, etc., that the Zhongwei Shipping Company needed telegraph operators and that he could introduce them, but they had to join the Seamen's Union and the China Ship Wireless Telegraphy Union, with a membership fee of four yuan per person. At that time, all five of Liu and others were willing to join and handed over the money to Fang to register and introduce them on their behalf. Fang issued receipts, took the money, and left. However, Liu and others waited for a long time without any news. They inquired at the union the day before yesterday and found that there was no one with the surname Fang, and they realized that they had been deceived. They were about to track down Fang's residence when Fang went to the school again that afternoon, trying to continue his deception. He was reported to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Fang. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Chen Ming, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the facts of the case and requested an adjournment for further investigation and prosecution. After a brief interrogation by the judge, he ordered that the defendant be detained for three days for investigation before further hearing.

### Can Cinder Stop Pain?

Yuan Shen Died in Vain

Wen Songhe, a native of Huzhou (37 years old), who resides at 219 West Aihamus Road in the French Concession and works as a Chinese bookkeeper in the rental office of the Darley Accountant and Real Estate Department, had a wife, Wen Shen, who was 34 years old this year. On the evening of the 30th of last month, her old stomach pain recurred. Misled by others, she believed that opium could treat illness and stop pain, so she swallowed a large amount of opium ash, resulting in poisoning. When Wen returned home at midnight, he found her unconscious, with a pale face. He immediately took her to the Baolong Hospital. Due to severe poisoning of the internal organs, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 1:30 AM the next morning. The hospital reported it to the French police, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. Yesterday afternoon, the Second Special District Court was requested to send prosecutor Dong Qiming and a forensic doctor to the hall. After examining the body, it was determined that Wen Shen had died of opium poisoning. After questioning the undertaker and the deceased's brothers, Shen Bingliang and Shen Bingkui, they were ordered to sign a guarantee to claim the body for burial.

### Football Player Assaults Referee, Case Filed

During a match between the Liangxi football team organized by Chih Chih College and the Nanching football team, Zhou Cheng, a Liangxi player, assaulted the referee Liu Hesheng due to a refereeing issue, causing injury. Liu Hesheng filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Local Court. Zhou Cheng was summoned but did not appear. Recently, he was apprehended. Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court yesterday. Liu Hesheng accused him of public insult, while Zhou denied any acts of violence. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation.

### Zhang Li Sues Sister-in-Law for Forging Documents and Fraud

Zhang Li, a 44-year-old housewife and owner of the Hengyuan Flower Factory in Yangsi District, Pudong, hired lawyer Zhang Shewo to sue her sister-in-law, Li Han, who resides at 24 Baosantu, Hejiahang, Shanghai, for forging documents and extortion at the Local Court. The suit stated that the defendant's husband, Li Changsheng, was the plaintiff's younger brother, who did not work and repeatedly borrowed money. In the spring of the twelfth year of the Republic, Changsheng asked Li Hegen to act as an intermediary to borrow 500 yuan from the Tianxiang family in Cunsi Township by mortgaging land. Subsequently, he continued to borrow, and by the twentieth year of the Republic, he owed the Tianxiang family 1,042.5 yuan. At the same time, other creditors urged him to repay. Changsheng was forced to ask the original intermediary, Li Hegen, and the plaintiff to act as intermediaries to resell the aforementioned six mu of land to Liu Ziqing, obtaining a price of 1,430 yuan. The plaintiff, considering his poverty and their close relationship, accepted 990 yuan on the spot to clear the debt, and the remaining 440 yuan was personally received by the defendant, Li Han, for debt repayment. For five years, there was no objection. In November of last year, the defendant suddenly had a whimsical idea. Her two sons were either serving in the army or working in a bank, and they had gained some fame and their family was becoming prosperous. She thought there was an opportunity to be seized, and she used a lawyer's letter to falsely claim that the aforementioned land deed was kept by the plaintiff and that in December of the 21st year of the Republic, the land was sold to Liu, a fellow villager, for 1,425 yuan. 960 yuan of it was borrowed from the plaintiff, and there was an IOU as proof. She demanded that it be returned within a time limit, otherwise she would sue. However, the claims in the lawyer's letter were completely false, so the IOU was also forged. Therefore, she asked for an investigation into the forgery of documents and extortion. Yesterday, Judge Yu Qingde opened the court. The defendant stated that the land deed was indeed kept by the plaintiff and that after the property was sold, the plaintiff had borrowed 960 yuan from her, and the IOU was not forged. The court summoned witnesses Li Hegen et al., who stated that the defendant had previously borrowed money from the plaintiff and that he was the original intermediary. Another witness, Li Huaiqing (Li Changsheng's uncle), stated that he did not know whether they had borrowed money or not. Li Changsheng stated in court that he had not borrowed money from his older sister, Zhang Li, siding completely with his wife. The court adjourned the hearing for a verdict after the conclusion of the arguments.

### Kuang Zhongmou Trusted an Old Woman, Her Son-in-Law Beaten by the Woman

Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai Market, is over sixty years old. His son, Kuang Baohui, works in the market, and Kuang's son-in-law is lawyer Wu Qinyan, who also lives there. There is an old woman named Xu Xiujin, who is over fifty years old but dresses like a woman in her twenties. Recently, she has gained Kuang Zhongmou's trust. Therefore, despite being an elderly woman, she is the manager of the Shaoxing Theater in Penglai Garden and the manager of the Yingbin Hall Bookstore in the center of the market, wielding great power. Kuang Zhongmou's son and others were dissatisfied and hated her, and their resentment grew. Unexpectedly, last month, Xu Xiujin, together with hooligans Zhao Jinbao and others, went to beat Kuang Baohui, and lawyer Wu Qinyan was also injured. Wu Qinyan was furious and sued Zhao Jinbao and seven or eight others for assault and injury. After prosecutor Jiang examined the injuries, he summoned the defendants yesterday, but none of them appeared. Only Wu Qinyan testified and requested their arrest.

### Two Opium Addicts Sicken and Die During Detoxification

Hou Afu, an opium addict, 29 years old and a native of Songjiang, was arrested by the Municipal Police Bureau on March 27th and sent to the Longhua Drug Rehabilitation Center. Unexpectedly, Hou's opium addiction flared up and turned into illness. On May 1st, he was unable to support himself and was sent to the Shanghai Hospital in Nanshi, where he died despite treatment.

### Ma Sifa's Corpse Was Devoured by Dogs

Ma Sifa, a 30-year-old native of Shandong, and his wife, Wang, made a living by rowing a boat together. On the 25th of last month, at 3:00 AM, Ma was lying naked in a quilt on the boat. Wang alone rowed the boat to the outside of the third and fourth pontoons of the fish market. In the darkness, a pair of Chongming fishing boats tilted and crushed the port side of the boat, causing water to enter. The next day, Wang reported to the Customs Water Police Station, claiming that her husband had been awakened at that time and jumped onto the fishing boat to reason, and then was taken away and never returned. She requested an investigation. The police chief approved the request for investigation. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, a naked male corpse was found on the shore of Chenjiazuijiao in Pudong, three or four zhang away from the water. The face, hands, and feet had been devoured by wild dogs. A Chinese policeman from the Water Police Station discovered it and retrieved it to the police station. Ma Wang was brought in and confirmed that it was the corpse of her husband. In the afternoon, Detective Yao Guofa was dispatched to report the corpse to the court for examination. The wife was ordered to collect the body and await investigation to determine the cause of death.

### Fire at Yangjiadu

In Qianjia Lane, east of Yangjiadu in Pudong, a hookah tobacco workshop opened by Qian Fuqing, a native of Jiangyin, consisting of three self-built thatched houses, one of which in the east end was rented to a tenant. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen behind Qian's house. Because the thatched house was flammable, the fire was quite fierce. The Pudong District and Yangjiadu Fire Brigades dispatched fire trucks to the scene to put out the fire, which was extinguished after about half an hour. Three thatched houses were destroyed, but the houses to the east were fortunately not affected. The Yangjiadu Police Station took Qian to the station. According to Qian's statement, the cause of the fire was an electrical short circuit. The Yangjiadu police chief ordered an investigation.

He has served as the president and medical director of the Public Health Association. He has been practicing medicine for more than ten years and has saved countless lives. Recently, Huang Tianzhu, the editor-in-chief of the Shishi Xinbao, had a son, Peiwen, who was four months old. Last month, he fell ill and was diagnosed by Western doctors as having meningitis. He was sent to the hospital for treatment, where he was subjected to two or thirty spinal taps and serum injections. After three weeks, his condition worsened, and the doctors gave up hope. Huang, who loved his son dearly, took him out of the hospital and hired traditional Chinese medicine doctor Gu Yushi for treatment. Gu diagnosed him with infantile convulsion. Although the illness was dangerous, there was still hope. He treated him well, and within days, he recovered completely. Huang was so grateful that he presented a plaque with the inscription "Hua Tuo Reborn" to express his admiration. Dr. Gu's clinic is located at 53 Tangen Road, Hongkou, telephone number 41118.

Commentary

### Floating Corpses

Last spring, in the Hai River area of Tianjin, as many as three or four hundred floating corpses were continuously recovered. At the time, this case "caused a great sensation" and attracted attention from all sides. However, when the floating corpses disappeared, the "detective cavalry" of the public security organs also "found no clues to follow" and it was unknown "where they went out" to investigate.

It has been a year since the floating corpse case. Although we are forgetful, and seem quite happy to be forgetful, the facts simply won't let you forget. Even if you forget about last year's events, this year you have another round. "Since April 17th, drifting floating corpses have been found in the Dazhigu area of the Hai River every day, as many as five or six, and as few as two or three. As of the 27th, more than 30 corpses have been recovered." This makes it impossible for you to kick away unpleasant memories even if you want to. Moreover, according to a special dispatch from this newspaper on the 30th, "Floating corpses are still being discovered in the Tianjin River in large numbers every day." It seems that even if you have the ability to forget about yesterday's events, there are constantly new facts to remind you!

Now that floating corpses have been discovered again, the public security organs will naturally have to "send out detective cavalry" again. Thus, in addition to stationing troops along the Hai River in Chentangzhuang County, they are "taking turns patrolling day and night along both banks of the Hai River." However, despite this, "no clues have been discovered." Perhaps this time, the "detective cavalry" that "went out" will again find no clues to follow and give up?

However, although the "detective cavalry" that "went out" has "not discovered any clues," there are many speculations about the source of the floating corpses. "Among the various speculations, the most compelling" is: "Recently, a certain party in Tianjin is recruiting laborers to go out of the pass. Han traitors are going all out to solicit them. No less than a thousand people respond every day. These laborers are not completely leaving the pass. It is rumored that there is a very large secret project in a certain concession. A certain party is forcing the recruited laborers to work there. However, in order to prevent the leakage of secrets, once each task is completed, they are all thrown into the Hai River to drown and silence them." This theory is quite credible, as evidenced by the "three major doubts" researched by the police bureau's detective corps: "First, in terms of age and gender, why are they all middle-aged men between the ages of twenty and forty, without a single old person, child, or woman; second, in terms of the condition of the corpses, most of them look like coolies, without any knife or stick wounds; third, dozens of corpses have no 'relatives' claiming them, nor are there any announcements of missing persons or people searching for them. They must not be residents of this city or nearby," which is consistent with the "coolies who come to Tianjin from the inland areas of Hebei and Shandong to make a living."

From the above phenomena, we can infer that the "most compelling" "speculation" will be correct. Although "it is still difficult to confirm what a certain party's secret project is due to lack of evidence," this is only a question of whether the case can be solved or not.

So, can this tragedy be solved? I believe that if we do not shy away from difficulties and pursue the matter seriously, it is not difficult to solve the case. If we are timid and shrink back everywhere, and as soon as the floating corpses disappear, the "detective cavalry" is also withdrawn, then this is only equivalent to guarding the floating corpses. If we want to solve the case, we don't even need to dream about it.

### The Fall of the City

— Sha Wen

——Remembering Shi Kefa——

"Not afraid of smoke and dust from all sides,
There is still Ya Fu's camp at the river;
Dim old eyes with deep night tears,
To lure out ten thousand troops from Huainan."

The Qing soldiers had already encamped at "Banzhuyuan" in a mighty manner.

Worry had dyed a few gray hairs on Governor Shi's head.

After writing an urgent appeal for help, the Governor tossed and turned, thinking about Duo Ergun's so-called well-intentioned proclamation to him: "If you are good at persuading people, no one will be killed." Should he surrender? However, the shame of surrendering and humiliating one's will, how could a tough guy like him who would never surrender do such a thing? He measured the situation with the country in mind, thinking about how to deal with this deadlock. Duo Ergun clearly pointed out two paths: either surrender or fight! Moreover, he maintained his majestic power of winning every battle: if he fought, the lives of the entire city would be completely trembling in the exchange between life and death. He was now taking an arrogant stance: "Surrender, Shi Kefa."

These words rang in Governor Shi's ears like thunder. He clenched his fists almost madly, and suddenly jumped up from the tiger skin chair: "Duo Ergun and some Manchurian slaves, come on, unless Shi Kefa dies, he will give up this ancient city of the Ming Dynasty." Although he was still thinking about the lives of this city; he loved the people, he defended the people: however, the yardstick of loyalty and integrity shattered this thought in an instant: "When the country is about to perish, every man is responsible."

Afterwards, the Qing court sent several letters of persuasion to surrender. He simply didn't read them and burned them to ashes in a fit of anger.

He anxiously awaited the reply to his plea for help.

A stone was thrown into the sea. Ma Shiying hid the urgent appeal. Only ghosts knew.

King Fu was immersed in the dreams of sensual pleasures.

Here was in a dangerous situation of deep water and scorching fire. Governor Shi walked onto the city wall, looking at the Qing soldiers nearby, the bright and luxurious banners, and the neat and orderly camps.

There had been several sieges.

The Qing soldiers surged up like a tide. The caltrops, rolling logs, stones, deer antlers, and horse traps on the city wall also flew down like thunderstorms. The tide retreated wave after wave, constantly rolling, and moreover, rolled up more violent waves, venting the shouts of the storm. The sky was darkened a lot by their shouts, and the mountains in the distance trembled and roared wildly.

It had been several days.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!..."

This sound wave gave the people in the city a threat:

"The red-coated cannons!"

"Boom!"

The city wall was hit, and the mud, bricks, and stones collapsed and flew apart.

Governor Shi, while ordering the repair of the city wall, continued to supervise the soldiers in scattering the caltrops, deer antlers, and other things densely; and stacking sandbags one by one, stacking them high.

"Boom!" The sparks exploded again among a group of soldiers. There was a burst of screams, but nothing strange was seen, only a mass of bloody flesh and bones, and some fragmented bones.

During the day, the sound of cannons would ring out at any time: unless it was late at night, the mouths of the cannons would have a chance to breathe, but occasionally there would be one or two blank shots that made people palpitate.

### The Five Elements of a Bank Experience 3

National City Bank of New York, Shanghai Branch, 41 Jiujiang Road

Money earned through sweat and blood, deposited in a bank, it is necessary to first understand the elements of a sound bank.

The third element is experience. The development of business and the stability of the foundation of a bank depend on experience.

National City Bank of New York, with its long history of one hundred and two hundred and fourteen years, has branches in major cities around the world with rich experience. In addition to operating various banking businesses, it also has a savings department. The operation is perfect, the guarantee is practical, and it serves the society.

The savings department can open an account with 10 yuan in national currency, and deposits can be made successively thereafter, with an interest rate of 3.5% per week.

## Page 20

The Governor led his subordinates, patrolling and defending day and night, repairing and rebuilding the dilapidated ancient city again and again. For the sake of the country and the public, they did not have the slightest fatigue or negligence, especially Governor Shi.

That day.

Strange rumors arose in the city, and people were uneasy. In addition, the supervising army Gao Qifeng and the general soldier Li Qifeng secretly lowered themselves down the city wall in the dark of night to surrender. Thus, a strong line of defense was shaken. Governor Shi's melancholy was increased by a large amount of bitterness. His face became increasingly haggard.

Under the attacks from all sides, Governor Shi Kefa, Prefecture Governor Ren Minyu, County Magistrate Zhou Zhiwei, General Soldier Liu Zhaoji, and Deputy General Shi Dewei, racked their brains to think of every possible way, but shook their heads. What else could they do in such a situation except expect reinforcements?

Reinforcements? This expectation was too far, far away. They forgot about the jealous Ma Shiying.

Food was also running out, and spies spreading rumors of exile were densely distributed in the city. Many soldiers fled, and Governor Shi sighed helplessly: "The affairs of the country are hopeless!"

Unexpectedly, they learned from the mouth of a captured spy that this day was the Qing soldiers' general assault.

The red-coated cannons were powerful and brutal like demons:

Boom boom boom boom

In the middle, countless arrows and flints swept past Governor Shi's hairline. He commanded calmly and unhurriedly. Originally, he had long since discarded death and left it to fate to decide.

The diffuse smoke, containing the smell of gunpowder, made the city wall seem to be falling into clouds, and the enemy's movements could not be seen clearly. The destruction of the city wall could not be rebuilt in time; corpses fell one by one, piled up, and a foul smell of blood could not be smelled at this moment.

Such slaughter continued until night:

The black wind rolled up the sand.

The city was finally broken, and a tragic scene was in the prologue:

Screams shook the heavens!

Overwhelming people:

—Children, women, the old and weak, the young and strong:—

—Screams, trampling, horse hooves, wails...—

Governor Shi's attempt to commit suicide was stopped by the quick-eyed adjutant Xu Jin, and they fled in a panic.

A cold arrow came and hit Xu Jin squarely, and he stretched his legs and fell to the ground and died. The Governor felt a pain in his heart. His subordinates were scattered and dead.

Suddenly a crowd of soldiers rushed up:

"Shi Kefa is here.

Undoubtedly, a cruel execution was added to the head of a hero!

### Especially on the Watershed

— Especially

Two thousand people

Walking along the secluded winding path, their footsteps made a harmonious sound in the muddy dampness. From the depths of the forest, a few crow calls came intermittently. The tenant farmers in the late evening allowed songs to break through the silent sky, overflowing into the fields, overflowing onto the blades of sickles.

In the stream, we stood our muddy feet on moss-covered stones, and with that, a turbid whirlpool, the mud floated away. Not far away, surrounded by small trees, was a large earthen grave. The area was quite large, and the green grass on top covered the eternally resting soul inside like a thick velvet.

Suddenly, a strange thought struck my mind. Graves were rarely seen along the way, or perhaps there were, buried in the shady side of the mountains that travelers could not reach. However, why was it so large? I didn't understand. I asked Old Zhang. He raised his loose eyelids, touched a few graying whiskers, and said:

——That is the grave of a thousand people, ah! His finger pointed to it, and then he pointed the peach wood stick into the distance: the ridge towering at the head of the watershed is the back ridge, which is the bloody place that caused this grave of a thousand people.

So, we sat on the slope of the mountain and let our nerves fly out with his narration.

It was more than ten years ago. Power was controlling people to compete, and the main part of the competition was the importance of the terrain. In this way, the provincial army and the foreign army used all their strength on the back ridge. In our eyes, it didn't seem that special. Afterwards, the war began, and the villagers nearby all fled. The artillery fire destroyed the simple thatched huts, and those who could not escape in time were buried under the broken tiles. It was early autumn, and fog and dew rose all over the fields. From the desolate moonlight until dawn, and from dawn to dusk, they faced each other for four consecutive days. As a result, the provincial army retreated, like a flood.

Afterwards, someone, I don't know who, took the lead and dug a large pit deep in this mountain ridge, and buried the bodies of both sides, and some who were half-dead, together. Although it was not quite "a thousand people", the number was always about the same when I thought about it.

We seemed to hear the fierce artillery fire exploding with huge sounds in our ears, and it was as if we heard the panic and wailing of people in the hail of gunfire. The dark sky was stained with red light, and warriors crawled out and rested again in the red light. With indescribable feelings, we circled the grave. The small trees were already taller than our heads, and the grass was several inches long. It had been more than ten years!

——Oh, the souls resting inside, how can they express the beautiful dreams they cherish?

### Sai Jinhua 14

— Chen He made

City after city was captured by their artillery fire. Wherever the Allied forces went, the people were massacred, the women were raped, the property was seized and robbed, the army had no discipline, the soldiers had no humanity, the sky was dark, the sun and moon were without light, and it was as tragic as hell!
