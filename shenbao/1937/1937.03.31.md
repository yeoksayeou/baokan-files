### The Revival of the Battleship and Big Gun Policy

— Fu

After the expiration of both the Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty at the end of last year, various countries began a major arms race this year. US President Roosevelt has already submitted to Congress a message with a huge national defense budget in the new year. In addition to passing a huge military expenditure, the British Parliament has also approved the issuance of huge national defense bonds. Japan in the Far East is also implementing its third naval replenishment plan this year. It is planned to build a huge 600,000 tons of warships within ten years. Other countries such as France, Italy, Germany, and the Soviet Union are naturally catching up, not letting the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan be uniquely beautiful in front.

Although the major arms race of various countries began after the expiration of the naval treaty at the end of last year, the policy of battleships and big guns has been revived only recently after Japan refused to join the regulations restricting the maximum gun caliber. Originally, although the London Naval Conference last year did not agree on the quantitative restrictions on the navies of various countries due to Japan's withdrawal, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France agreed on local qualitative restrictions afterward, that is, the maximum caliber of the 35,000-ton battleship armed gun should be limited to 14 inches. However, this restriction stipulated that it could only take effect after other naval powers also accepted it. Therefore, since December last year, the United Kingdom has been vigorously encouraging Japan to join the new agreement, and hoped that Japan could issue a satisfactory reply before the end of April. But now Japan has formally refused to join the regulations restricting the maximum gun diameter to 14 inches on the 27th.

Due to Japan's refusal to join, this qualitative restriction naturally became invalid. Because no naval power is willing to see its naval combat power inferior to that of other countries. According to foreign news, the United States has decided to install 16-inch heavy guns on the two battleships that will begin construction this summer. At the same time, the British side is also preparing to build battleships over 35,000 tons. From then on, the policy of big guns and battleships from more than ten years ago will be revived again.

Japan's reason for refusing to participate in the new London Naval Treaty is that it refers to the fact that there are only qualitative restrictions and no quantitative restrictions, which fundamentally violates the spirit of arms reduction. On the surface, this statement has considerable justification. Because quantitative restrictions on armaments are as important as qualitative restrictions, and even more important than qualitative restrictions. And now the new London Naval Treaty ignores quantitative restrictions and only stipulates a part of qualitative restrictions (in a broad sense, qualitative restrictions should include the abolition of aggressive weapons such as heavy guns, battleships, bombers, and poison gas). This naturally cannot be considered the true spirit of arms reduction. However, we have to say back. Although this part of the qualitative restriction method cannot satisfy people, it is better than no restriction at all. At the same time, we must also point out that the reason why the London Naval Conference last year failed to agree on quantitative restriction methods was because Japan was holding on to its policy of outward expansion and insisted on the principle of parity, and even withdrew from the conference, which led to the complete failure of the conference. Now Japan is saying that the restriction method agreed upon by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France only emphasizes quality and does not consider quantity. This truly fully demonstrates the self-deceiving attitude of aggressionism.

Now the maritime arms race has actively begun in terms of quantity and quality. Although the famous reporter Warner said in the New York People's Voice Forum that the United States is still willing to abide by quantitative restrictions and earnestly hopes that the United Kingdom will initiate negotiations and re-sign a new treaty. Although the United Kingdom has appointed arms reduction expert Craigie as the ambassador to Japan and is traveling to Tokyo via the United States to take office, preparing to take the opportunity to reopen naval reduction negotiations, it is inevitable that the arms reduction envoys will encounter a nose of ashes in this world shrouded in gunpowder.

### Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan

Remarkable and Impressive Achievements: Rapid Development in Agriculture and Industry; Entire Plan to be Completed by the End of This Year

[Moscow] The Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union recently released a report outlining the results of the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan in the past year and the progress of various economic construction projects this year. The report stated that in 1936, heavy industry and food production both saw significant increases, as did cotton harvests. Railway construction and transportation also experienced substantial development, and general wages have increased, along with the number of employees. However, forestry, coal, oil, and inland river shipping experienced slower development due to the sabotage of the Trotskyists. The report then outlined the various programs to be implemented by various sectors of the national economy this year, and stated that based on the current situation, it is expected that the targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan will not only be achieved by the end of this year, but also surpassed. (Central News Agency, Havas, 30th)

[Moscow] According to a report released today by the Central Executive Committee, the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan is expected to be completed satisfactorily this year. According to the report, industrial output in 1936 increased by 28.4% compared to the previous year, far exceeding the expected 23%. Furthermore, although the southwest suffered severe drought this year, agricultural production was still very abundant, and cotton production in particular exceeded expectations. Railway projects have also exceeded planned targets, but coal, oil, and other industries have not yet reached their planned figures. The value of industrial products planned for 1937 is 103 billion rubles. In addition, it is planned to construct hundreds of miles of railways, several power plants, and a number of mining fields and oil wells. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 30th)

[Moscow] The resolution of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union on the 1937 Soviet National Economic Plan has been released. The content first pointed out that the basic political and economic tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan have made great achievements in 1936, and the conditions for completing the plan in 1937 have also been created.

Industrial production in 1936 increased by 28.4% compared to 1935, while the original plan was only to increase by 23%. Heavy industry, light industry, food, and local industries all exceeded the plan for the year. Heavy industry has also completed 98.3% of the Second Five-Year Plan. In agriculture, although the Volga region and other areas in the southeast experienced severe drought, the consolidation of collective and state farms still resulted in good results, and the large over-fulfillment of cotton harvesting quotas for the Five-Year Plan was the most important victory. Railway transportation exceeded by 8% in the year, and the railway aspect of the Five-Year Plan has been completely exceeded. The trade plan has also been exceeded, and the total trade volume has increased sharply by 30%, exceeding 10 billion rubles. The income of workers and employees has also increased, and the number of people employed has increased by one million last year.

On the other hand, the resolution also pointed out the shortcomings in the development of the national economy, such as the lagging technical transformation of light industry, the timber industry, and waterway transportation, and the failure of coal mining, oil, and other industries to complete their plans. It also stated that the sabotage activities of Japanese, German, and special agent spies uncovered last year in industry and transportation caused great losses to the development of the national economy. 'At the same time, their inability to hinder the rapid growth of the socialist economy proves that our organizational structure is better and more serious in the struggle against anti-Soviet forces. We will surely achieve greater success.' The resolution declares that eliminating the above shortcomings is a necessary condition for completing the 1937 national economic plan.

The resolution then announced that the total value of industrial production in 1937 should be 103 billion rubles, an increase of 20% compared to last year, of which heavy industry and national defense industry account for more than 40 billion rubles, light industry accounts for more than 10 billion rubles, and the food industry accounts for about 11.5 billion rubles.

This year's plan stipulates that the electricity production target is 40.5 billion kilowatt-hours, coal is over 150 million tons, oil is over 32 million tons, pig iron is over 16 million tons, steel is over 20 million tons, copper is 145,000 tons, lathes are 41,000 units, locomotives are 1,900 units, railway cars are 44,000 units, tractors are many units with a total horsepower of 2.59 million, combine harvesters are 55,000 units, cars are 220,000 units, bicycles are 900,000 units, phonographs are 1 million units, cotton fabrics are over 4 billion meters, meat is 800,000 tons, sugar is 2.6 million tons, and bread is 17 million tons.

The plan stipulates that compared with last year, industrial labor productivity should increase by 19.5%, increase income by 5.6%, and reduce industrial production costs by more than 3%. The capital construction expenditure in the industrial sector is 13.926 billion rubles. The plan stipulates that many new power plants should be completed this year, with a total generating capacity of 1,469,000 kilowatts, 16 coal mines with a total output of 7,470,000 tons, and 23 new coal mines with a total output of 21.5 million tons. In addition, 2,100 new oil wells, 8 oil refineries, 5 iron smelting furnaces, 10 hot bed steelmaking furnaces, 3 Bessemer steelmaking plants, 14 iron rolling mills, the first part of the Balkhash copper smelting complex, the entire Buriat copper and sulfur smelting complex, the entire Ural aluminum plant, and 2 ore washing plants should be put into operation. In addition, the Stalin Automobile Factory should increase its output to 100,000 cargo trucks and 15,000 cars, and the Molotov Automobile Factory should increase its output to 200,000 cargo trucks and 50,000 cars.

In the timber industry, the output of various paper mills should increase by 151,000 tons, and the output of celluloid factories should increase by 20,000 tons. Many new paper mills and celluloid factories should be established, and about 1,000 kilometers of timber transportation railways should be constructed. In the light industry, various yarn mills should increase spindles by 450,000, and two linen yarn complexes and one rayon factory should be established. Other factories and plants should also be built in several locations. In the food industry, two meat processing complexes, one fishing complex, several refrigeration plants, two sugar factories, 19 mechanized bread factories, one alcohol factory, and various other enterprises should be established.

The plan stipulates that the basic task in agriculture is to improve labor organization methods based on the experience of agricultural Stakhanovite movement participants, to make 100% use of agricultural technology and equipment, and to introduce excellent agricultural technology to achieve a sharp increase in the yield of all crops. Within this year, 612 new machine-tractor stations should be added, and 66,000 tractors should be added, with a total horsepower of 1,829,900. 55,000 combine harvesters and hundreds of thousands of other machines should be added. This year, the grain harvest should be 661.3 million poods, cotton should be over 46 million poods, flax should be 8.3 million poods, and sugar beets should be 245 million quintals. The capital construction expenditure in the agricultural sector is 2.614 billion rubles.

On the railway side, the average daily loading of wagons should be 95,000 (86,000 last year), and the total freight volume should be 565 million tons. The capital construction is planned to be 5.553 billion rubles. New railways opened to traffic should be 1,167 kilometers, double-track railways should be 1,104 kilometers, and electrified railways should be 561 kilometers.

Air transportation should reach 25 million ton-kilometers, an increase of 19% compared to last year. Trade revenue should reach 13.1 billion rubles. Housing construction projects should exceed 2.5 billion rubles. Water plants should be built in 17 cities, and sewage systems should be added in 10 cities.

The number of students in primary and secondary schools should reach 30,033,000 (27,418,000 last year), and the number of children in kindergartens should be 1,279,000 (1,030,000 last year). 930 new schools should be built in various cities, with 528,000 new students enrolled.

This year's health expenditure should be 752.8 million rubles (580.3 million rubles last year). The capital construction cost for this project is 1 billion rubles.

The expenses of scientific institutions should be 92.4 million rubles (79.7 million rubles last year), of which 24.5 million rubles are used for capital construction.

Nine new theaters and 56 cinemas should be opened this year, and 5,945 movie projectors should be installed.

The number of workers and staff employed by all state-owned enterprises and institutions should increase by 2.1% compared with last year, and the average wage should increase by 7.4%. The total capital construction plan for the national economy should be 32.5 billion rubles.

The resolution finally pointed out that the completion of the 1937 plan will enable the Second Five-Year Plan to not only complete but also exceed the entire industry and other basic tasks. (TASS, 30th)

### U.S. New Deal Laws: Three Upheld by Supreme Court as Legal

Minimum Wage Law for Women Workers: Ruled Valid by One Vote

[Washington] The Supreme Court today ruled that three New Deal laws are constitutional. Two are federal laws, and one is a law of the State of Washington. All are of great importance to the New Deal's social and economic programs. The first is the Farm Mortgage Moratorium Act, which allows farmers to retain their collateral for up to three years while adjusting their debts. The third is the Railway Labor Act of 1934, which stipulates that workers have the right to organize unions and negotiate with employers. The third is the Washington State law stipulating a minimum wage for women workers. The rulings on the first and second cases were unanimous among all judges. The third case was decided by a ratio of five to four. Previously, the New York State unemployment law also had the same minimum wage provision, but the court did not pass it. This time, Judge Roberts changed his attitude, so the proponents were able to obtain a majority. The dissenting opinion was issued by Judge Sutherland, whose words were similar to responding to President Roosevelt's proposal to reform the judicial system. He said, 'Changes in economic conditions cannot change the meaning of the Constitution.' (National Telegram, 29th)

### U.S. Delegation Arrives in London

To Attend International Sugar Conference

[London] The International Sugar Conference is scheduled to open in London in April and May. The U.S. delegation led by Davis arrived here today. News article reporter Jordan recently published an article stating that Davis will take this opportunity to discuss with the British government the issue of establishing an economic understanding between Britain, France, and the United States. According to reports, U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, had previously held talks with French Prime Minister Blum in Paris, during which he discussed the issues of reducing tariff barriers among the three major democratic countries of Britain, France, and the United States, and establishing a political understanding to safeguard peace. However, the British government believes that this plan conflicts with the Ottawa Imperial Agreement, so it does not quite agree with it. When British Trade Minister Runciman visited the United States and met with President Roosevelt, he explained Britain's position to Britain. (Central News Agency, Havas, 30th)

### Atmosphere of Parliamentary Dissolution Thickens: Japanese Political Situation Chaotic

Centered on Amendment to Election Law: Political Parties and Government in Secret Conflict

[Tokyo] Because political parties centered on the election law bill halted the deliberation of the government's proposal, the government convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 4:10 PM on the 30th. Cabinet members reported on the situation of reviewing the bill and discussed countermeasures. Minister of the Navy Mitsumasa Yonai expressed strong opinions, saying that the two major parties, the Seiyukai and Minseito, strongly demanded that the government pass the amendment to the election law and stopped the deliberation of important bills. Such facts are difficult to believe that political parties have sincerity, so they should implement dissolution under the meaning of urging political parties to reflect. However, Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki and Minister of Communications Kodama and others advocated prudence, saying that the arguments of the political parties are not unreasonable. The government must fully consider this point, and at the same time, urge the political parties to reflect. Everyone expressed their opinions, and the question of whether to dissolve is currently being discussed, so the situation is very serious. (Domei News Agency, 30th)

[Tokyo] The Seiyukai and Minseito parties are strongly hoping to pass the amendment to the election law, but the government is not actively working on it. Today, the relevant committee of the House of Peers adjourned in the morning, and the atmosphere of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties suddenly deteriorated. Today, the plenary session of the House of Representatives was convened and immediately adjourned. From 2:00 PM, Sakura, Koizumi of the Minseito party, and Matsuno, Ando of the Seiyukai party discussed the issue of promoting the bill and passing the election law. If the government's attitude towards the election law is still not to work hard to promote its passage, then the deliberation of important bills will also be stopped. Therefore, the government's attitude and the parties' handling of this matter are worthy of attention. (Domei News Agency, 30th)

### House of Representatives Plenary Session

Poor Atmosphere in the Chamber

[Tokyo] The plenary session of the House of Representatives convened today from 2:20 PM and immediately adjourned. After two hours and forty minutes, it continued to convene until 5:00 PM. Masakazu Miyake of the Social Mass Party requested to speak on the progress of the proceedings, shouting,

The government attempts to proceed with the proceedings, extending the session by six days for this purpose, while the political parties are clamoring about the amendment of the election law and the issue of human rights abuses, and have not proceeded with deliberation. This is a loss of the authority of the parliament and can be called a complete disgrace. Moreover, when the plenary session convenes, it adjourns for such a long time, wasting time. What is the reason?

Speaker Tomita replied,

The speaker had no choice but to adjourn in order to conduct the proceedings smoothly. At this point, the proceedings began, the agenda was changed, and the 'Industrial Association Central Treasury Law Amendment' proposed by the government was discussed. After Minister Yamazaki explained the reasons for the proposal, it was entrusted to the committee.

The following two proposals were also urgently submitted: ㊀ Japan Fuel Industry Co., Ltd. Bill, ㊁ Artificial Petroleum Manufacturing Bill, both of which were confirmed to be resolvable according to the committee's report.

Next, the government's 'Department Store Bill' was proposed. After Torakichi Oshima (Minseito) and the Minister of Commerce asked and answered questions, Koichi Tsuru (Seiyukai) questioned the Ministers of the Army and Navy, saying that according to the recent claims of the military, the countryside is the reservoir of national defense, so the poverty of the countryside will cause defects in national defense. Why is there no mention of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists?

The Minister of Commerce gave a brief reply, and the military ministers did not answer.

Next, after Kosaku Maeda asked and answered questions with the Minister of Commerce regarding the establishment of department store tax, it was entrusted to the committee. The following two proposals were also confirmed to be resolvable with supplementary resolutions added by each faction: ㊀ Seafarers Law Amendment, ㊁ Japan Wireless Telegraph Co., Ltd. Law Amendment.

At this time, Sakichi Hattori of the Minseito party moved to change the agenda in order to deliberate on the bills proposed by the members.

Speaker Tomita rose and said——

Regarding the change of agenda, it is being negotiated with the government. Please wait for the time being.

At that time, the atmosphere in the chamber seemed to be poor. The government also did not agree. After the clerks came and went, the speaker announced an adjournment, which was already 6:39 PM. (Domei News Agency, 30th)

[Tokyo] The important bill for this Diet session, the next fiscal year's budget, was formally established after passing the House of Peers on the 29th. However, although the Diet session has been extended by the government for six days, there are only two days left now, and 44 government bills have not yet been established. Among them are important laws such as the Iron and Steel Business Law and the Export Control Tax Law, which may be difficult to deliberate on in this short period of time. Therefore, from all aspects of observation, the government must extend the session by one more day. Government officials also recognize the need to extend the session. (Domei News Agency, 30th)

[Tokyo] Ikeda Seihin, President of the Bank of Japan, visited Prime Minister Hayashi on the evening of the 29th and had a conversation for more than an hour. President Ikeda explained the current state of the financial world in detail. Prime Minister Hayashi originally planned to implement the current cabinet's independent policies after the end of the Diet session. Therefore, he listened to the Minister of Finance's report on the situation of the economy and the financial world, and listened to various opinions from President Ikeda to establish a reference for policy.

### U.S. Decides to Proceed with Supplementary Shipbuilding Plan

Large Navy Faction's Plan Shelved: British Newspaper Comments on Naval Competition

[Washington] According to today's news, senior U.S. naval officers have decided on a shipbuilding plan to temporarily maintain the principle of supplementing at any time, regardless of the actions of other countries. The plan proposed by the large navy faction to add ten cruisers has been shelved. Secretary of the Navy Swanson also agreed with this claim in order to avoid repeating the mistake of having a large number of destroyers becoming obsolete after the European War. It is reported that the Navy may build the U.S. Navy to the limit permitted by the treaty by 1942 in accordance with the Queen Delaware Act passed by Congress, and build two battleships this year. Although Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Leahy, has stated that the U.S. Navy has decided to maintain its strength equal to that of any country, the British naval expansion plan may cause the U.S. to increase its construction of warships. However, judging from the situation, the U.S. may still adhere to the original plan. Naval officers expressed that they are not surprised by the British seven-year shipbuilding plan. However, this decision does not mean that there is still hope for various countries to conclude a naval treaty within one or two years. Officially, no news of convening a naval conference has been heard. (National Telegram, 29th)

[London] The Japanese government recently notified Britain that it refused to accept the battleship gun diameter limit (i.e., 14 inches) stipulated in the 1936 London Naval Treaty. The Times recently commented on this matter with rather harsh words, stating that 'if the caliber of battleship guns is changed from the 14 inches stipulated by the London Treaty to 16 inches in the future, the naval arms race will start again. Whether this competition can be avoided is in the hands of Japan. Although the country withdrew from the naval conference midway last year, if it can accept the 14-inch gun diameter limit before April 1, the naval arms race can be saved. Otherwise, countries around the world will inevitably expand their navies without limit and recklessly. Who is responsible for this? There is no doubt about it.' (Central News Agency, Havas, 30th)

Approximately one hundred officers and soldiers have been executed by firing squad, half of whom were executed in Morocco. The reason for this defection on the rebel side is said to be that General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebels, intended to cede command of the army to Italian officers. Rebel officers and soldiers, feeling humiliated by the defeat at Guadalajara, blamed the Italian troops for it and were dissatisfied, so they considered rebellion and plotted to assassinate Franco and release government prisoners. There are still hundreds of people in custody, and the case was solved by German spies. (National Telegram, 30th)

⊙Tangier  According to news obtained here today, thirty soldiers serving at the Tetuan airfield in Spanish Morocco were all shot on the 24th of this month.

### Italian Troops Massacre People in Abyssinia

Affecting Many Italians; U.S. Embassy to be Closed

[London]  After General Graziani, the Italian Governor of Abyssinia, was ambushed by natives in Addis Ababa on the 19th of last month, a portion of the Italian garrison immediately carried out a large-scale massacre in the city as retaliation. According to The Times, after General Graziani learned of this retaliatory action, he immediately ordered two hundred of his soldiers to be sent back to their home country. It is also reported that the Italian troops were indiscriminately slaughtering people, and several Italians in the area were even shot and killed, demonstrating the brutality of the massacre. Since this tragedy occurred, trade relations between Abyssinia and other countries have been suspended. The companies operated by British and Indian merchants, as well as Belgian banks, have been closed. It is heard that the intention of the Italian policy is to force all non-Italian-operated stores in the two countries to close within a few months. In addition, the two sons of Dr. Martin, the Abyssinian minister to England, were recently executed by firing squad in Addis Ababa on suspicion of plotting to assassinate General Graziani.

[Rome]  The U.S. Consul in Addis Ababa, Mr. Heath,

has completely closed the U.S. diplomatic mission in Abyssinia today and is preparing to go to Djibouti this week. The U.S. Embassy will be officially closed this Wednesday. In the future, the interests of the American people in Abyssinia will be jointly managed by the U.S. Embassy in Italy. Italian people are quite surprised by this move, as they believed that the United States would follow Britain's example and still establish a consulate in Addis Ababa. However, the Italian government must recognize the Italian king as the Emperor of Abyssinia before it can recognize Heath's consular qualifications. The State Department naturally refused, so Heath is temporarily only using a regular tourist passport in Abyssinia. As for the former U.S. Minister to Abyssinia, Mr. Engert, he is currently staying in Naples, Italy, for a few days before departing for the United States. (National Telegram, 29th)

### Japanese Naval Commissioner Measures Tanggu Port

Nomura Appointed to be in Charge, Coming to Handle Matters; Eastern Development Invests in the Development of North China's Economy

Tianjin Correspondence: Okano, Commander of the 14th Destroyer Division of the Japanese Ryojun Naval Port, arrived in Tianjin on the destroyer "Ogi" at 7:00 PM on the 29th, berthing at the Dalian pier in Special District No. 3. On the morning of the 30th, he will, along with Captain Iwashita and all the officers and men of the ship, land to visit the shrine, and visit Tasiro, Commander of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, and Kubota, the naval attache in Tianjin. The ship sailed from Ryojun on the 27th, arrived in Tanggu on the 28th, and is scheduled to stay in Tianjin for four days. On April 2nd, it will sail to Tanggu again, berth for one day, and then sail back to Ryojun. Regarding the Japanese plan to construct Dagu and Tanggu into primary and secondary seaports, since strengthening the Headquarters of the North China Garrison Army, they have sent hydraulic expert Sakamoto to China to survey and prepare a plan to be submitted to the Japanese Military Department. The Japanese Military Department then decided to hand it over to the naval authorities for re-evaluation, as preparation for construction, and specifically ordered Nomura, the 3rd Section Chief of the Naval General Staff, and his staff member Nakamura to fly to Pingjin on April 1. That afternoon, they will arrive in Tianjin, and together with Kubota, the naval attache in Tianjin, and Kobetsu, the naval attache in Pingjin, take the destroyer 'Ogi' to Tanggu to measure the harbor mouth, and return to Tianjin on April 2. They will then consult with Tasiro, Hashimoto, and the naval attaches stationed in Pingjin to exchange harbor construction opinions, and then travel to the Northeast to meet with Tojo, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, to hear their intentions before returning to Japan to report. How the project will be implemented in the future, the highest Japanese military department will take Nomura's report as the guideline.

In addition to planning to construct the Tanggu and Dagu ports, Japan also plans to build the Daqing River Estuary in the puppet Jidong area as a free trade port or a port for both military and commercial use. The river mouth was designated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen as one of the three major northern ports. The Japanese naval authorities have long paid attention to the area and measured it many times last year, believing that the shape and water volume meet the conditions for port construction. Only the location is not as important as the Tanggu and Dagu ports, and the situation of holding the throat of Pingjin, but in the Luandong area, it occupies a special position as an import and export outlet. Therefore, they advocate its development. Recently, after contacting the puppet Jidong government, the puppet side has also agreed to the construction. However, due to funding issues, it will first be developed as a trading port, to be used as a port for unloading smuggled goods. A highway is planned to be built first from Tangshan to the river mouth to facilitate transportation. If the port is officially built, a railway line will be built along the highway route. This time, Nomura will come to Tianjin and will visit the area after measuring the Tanggu and Dagu ports.

Ikeda, Chief of the Third Section of the Japanese Army Headquarters stationed in North China, will return to Japan to activate economic development funds in North China and is scheduled to return to Tianjin in early April. The Japanese Army Headquarters has only two ways to raise capital for the restoration of the Longyan Iron Mine and the construction of the Jinshi Road: one is to transfer 24 million yuan from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' fund for cultural undertakings in China, with 10 million yuan for the restoration of the Longyan Mine and 14 million yuan for the construction of the Jinshi Railway; the other is to draw out the Oriental Development Company for cooperation and invest capital. After Ikeda returned to China to negotiate the former method, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected it, determining that the fund for cultural undertakings in China is specifically for cultural undertakings in China, and its importance is no less than economic development issues. Once transferred, all cultural matters in China would be suspended. Therefore, the Japanese Army Headquarters was asked not to transfer it. After Ikeda negotiated the latter method, a report has arrived in Tianjin, stating that the Oriental Development Company has agreed, and its president, Yasukawa Yunosuke, may come north in the near future, and the Japanese Army Headquarters will guide the investigation. It is said that the Oriental Development Company plans to invest about 25 million yuan. If this can be done, then the priority plans of the Japanese Army Headquarters to restore the Longyan Mine and build the Jinshi Road will all be realized. As for the Jinshi Railway, the Japanese side had intended to reduce it to the Cangshi Road in order to save construction costs. Recently, because the Tanggu harbor construction project is also in the plan, in order to obtain land and water connections to achieve its long-term plan to control North China, it has decided to build the Jinshi route as originally planned.

### Bandit Leader Fang Buzhou of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Border Area Surrenders to the National Army

You Guocai Reports Victory from Southern Hubei by Telegram to Hankou

Hankou Correspondence: The bandit leaders Chuan Qiutao and Fang Buzhou have kidnapped bandit crowds and roamed the border areas of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi for several years, with Huangjindong as their main bandit nest. Since You Guocai was transferred to Hubei to serve as the commander of the Fourth Column, the 121st Division under his command, commanded by Wu Jianping, and the newly-established 8th Division, commanded by Jiang Pishu, have also been stationed in southern Hubei, engaged in searching and suppressing bandits, repeatedly inflicting heavy losses on the bandits. Bandit Chuan served as the chairman of the puppet Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Soviet Province and the political commissar of the military region headquarters. Bandit Fang served as the commander of the puppet 16th Division. In terms of official rank, Chuan was above Fang. Earlier this month, the old nest of Huangjindong was captured by the National Army. Bandit Chuan led more than 300 remnants of the puppet Independent Regiment and the Special Service Battalion, fleeing east from the nest, passing through Xiushui in Jiangxi to Tongcheng in Hubei, joining forces with the puppet 16th Division. The puppet 16th Division of Bandit Fang had been repeatedly suppressed by You's army, suffering heavy losses, and his wife was captured alive. Fang's attitude gradually became negative. After Bandit Chuan entered Hubei, he criticized Fang as right-leaning, removed Fang from his post for inspection, seized his army, and appointed his puppet chief of staff Zhang Shunxin as the acting commander of the puppet 16th Division. In Sanjietian, the bandit crowds were reorganized, incorporating the puppet Independent Regiment into the puppet 16th Division, forming the 46th and 48th Regiments and the Special Service Company directly under the division, with more than 600 rifles, two heavy machine guns, and three light machine guns, and more than 800 bandits. Ammunition and supplies were in panic. Fang fled with two pistols. On the 27th of this month, he fled to Longgang, which belongs to Yangxin, and surrendered to the Wei Regiment of the newly established 8th Division. At the same time, You's army also defeated the main force of the bandits in Hengling, Sidu Port, Zhumuwo, Yanglousi and other places belonging to Chongyang, and destroyed the bandit nest. The future of the bandits will be eliminated due to internal divisions and the fierce attack of the National Army. Yesterday, You Guocai telegraphed Hankou to report the victory. The text is as follows: (1) The remnants of the bandits in southern Hubei have been repeatedly suppressed by our 121st Division and the new 8th Division, suffering heavy losses. Now the bandit leader of the puppet 16th Division, Fang Buzhou, has surrendered to our Longgang garrison Wei Regiment today, and will be escorted to Yangxin tomorrow. After the headquarters arrives, the details will be telegraphed again. I hope it will be forwarded to the headquarters as soon as possible. Commander You Guocai felt it. (2) According to the telegram from Commander Li Yoyou, I was ordered to lead the Liu and Li Battalions and the machine special departments to reach Sidu Port before Yoyou, and in Zhumuwo, Yanglousi and other places, I copied the Soviet government and Red Army 6th Division political department bandit hospital of the puppet Hubei-Jiangxi province, more than 100 bandits, carrying dozens of guns, fleeing in two directions, one to Panshuping and the other to the border of Bixi. More than 20 bandits were captured, including a political commissar, and a new-style rifle and many printed materials were obtained, including a mobilization guide. The bandits built sheds of thatch and lived in the deep mountains, and the companies are searching for them, so that no one escapes. In addition to ordering the regimental commander to continue the search and suppression, I specifically report. (29th)

### Songjiang

Strong Men Dredge Gu Pu Pond

Gu Pu Pond outside the East Gate of the county is an important waterway for transportation in the western district. Due to years of siltation, the county government has convened township chiefs of various related districts and towns to discuss dredging. Now, 1,000 strong men are drawn from the first and second district offices, and the dredging will start on April 1.

### Kunshan

Raise Funds to Dredge Xu Fen Pond River

The Xu Fen Pond River in the first district starts from Gaoban Bridge in the south and ends at Tongcheng Road in the north, with a total length of 480 meters. It is an important transportation route in the urban area. However, due to years of siltation, the impact is quite significant. Moreover, the north end of the river is about 45 meters away from the outer city river and does not connect to the flow. Therefore, whenever the water level is low, the river water is smelly and turbid, which is even more relevant to public health. Now the county government plans to dredge and open it to connect to the city river, and has sent personnel to measure it, and plans to use national labor service to implement the work.

### Taicang

Committing Suicide for Being Unable to Repay Rent

Shen Ruixiang, a villager in Xuetian Port, Guliu Township, First District, is forty-six years old this year. In addition to farming, he also works as a plumber. His family is poor and he owes the Education Bureau 42 yuan in rent. The Education Bureau has repeatedly sent Zhou Pinlian to urge him to collect the money, but to no avail, so he sent a letter to the police station to pursue him. The bureau sent two policemen to capture Shen. When he arrived at the new wooden bridge on the east side of Ban Jing Wan, Shen jumped into the Liuhe Pond. The river there is wide and deep, and the currents are rapid, and he was immediately submerged. The body was rolled up by the bureau with a rolling hook. After the county sent personnel to inspect it, the body was buried. The old and frail mother carried two children to the scene to ask the Education Bureau for compensation. The director agreed to give 100 yuan to settle the case.

### A Certain National Entered the Country Causing Disturbances

At the South Gate Station on the afternoon of the 29th, a strange car suddenly came without a note. The drivers were two foreigners who spoke Japanese. The station did not stop them to avoid disputes. Unexpectedly, the foreigners took photos arbitrarily in the car, and the guards stopped them. When checking their side, there was no travel passport. It is inevitable that there will be some disputes, which is actually caused by the fact that the two sides do not understand each other's language. However, the audience gathered more and more and followed behind. When they arrived at the South Gate, the guards saw that the crowd was disturbing and hindering traffic, so they stepped forward to disperse them. Unexpectedly, the foreigners misunderstood and involved them in the agitation, and smashed the police car. At the time, someone who knew a little Japanese and a patrol team of the garrison happened to pass by, and translated and ordered them to hand over the photos taken along the way, and then the matter was over. The Japanese also returned immediately.

Education News

### Municipal Education Association's Movement to Reduce Textbook Prices

▲ Lists Four Reasons for Price Reduction

▲ Sends Another Letter to the Booksellers Association to Argue Based on Reason

The Municipal Education Association and various educational organizations of this city, in order to reduce the burden on students, jointly requested the Ministry of Education to order the Booksellers Association in various places to reduce the selling price of textbooks, as reported in previous newspapers. The Municipal Booksellers Association once sent a letter to the Municipal Education Association stating that it could not reduce prices. The Municipal Education Association specifically listed four reasons yesterday and sent another letter to the Booksellers Association to argue. The original letter and reasons are excerpted below:

Sends Another Letter to the Booksellers Association to Argue Based on Reason To the point, the large letter has been read. The association previously stated that your members have increased the selling price of textbooks, hindering the popularization of education. We once sent a letter requesting that the selling price be based on the actual price without secret commissions, and that the selling price be appropriately reduced based on the cost. Unexpectedly, the reply stated that the members had reduced the list price and implemented it last year, and that the price of paper may increase again. After reading it, I felt very regretful. What is the truth about the so-called reduction? The original price was one dime, sold for six cents, and now the price of six cents is actually sold. What is the so-called reduction of half a catty or eight taels? Moreover, I heard from people in the book industry that last year's industry rebates were as high as 40% or more. This year's industry rebates are 15% in this city and 25% outside the city. The Ministry of Education ordered that the selling price be reduced. Your members not only failed to comply, but also increased it accordingly, secretly raising it by another 20%, and saying that it had been reduced last year. What was reduced? It is really confusing. The so-called increase in the price of lead printing, the increase in the price of silk, and the increase in the price of other industries are indeed facts. However, the business of other industries is clear, and the business of real industries is obscure. When the raw materials of other industries rise, they have to rise accordingly. When the raw materials of your industry rise, there is still twice the profit to be made. In other words, according to the report of Director Wu Yan of the Ministry of Education, the cost of elementary school textbooks is about four li. Even if the price of raw materials increases this year, it will be at most one cent. Proof of the facts, such as a certain bookstore in your industry that has not joined your association to jointly monopolize and profit, so the price of each textbook is only three cents at the store. The same industry adds rebates and short-term textbooks, and literacy textbooks cost raw materials. What is the difference? They only sell for one cent, and each bookstore is rushing to sell them, which shows that the price you are selling now still has a lot of profit to be made. You should consider reducing it to benefit education, and your industry's reduction of textbook prices will benefit others and not harm yourself. I have enclosed a copy of the materials obtained by this association for the reduction and sale of textbooks, and I ask you to consider it again.

Four points of materials to be reduced ㊀ In February 1936, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to all painting bureaus to abolish the selling price based on actual cost, and to reduce the selling price according to the cost to reduce the burden on students' parents. The bookstores published this order in the newspapers (between March, April, and May) and said that they would comply with the Ministry's order. How do they know that the booksellers actually implemented the first half of the order, but did not implement the second half of the price reduction, and instead reduced the industry rebates. Because of the Ministry of Education's order, it became a talisman for price increases. Now let's list it as follows: The list price of elementary school textbooks before July was one dime, sold at 60% off, which is six cents. The industry rebate was up to 40%, and the average was 30%. After July, the actual price was six cents. The industry rebate was 15% in this city, and the highest was 25% outside the city. ㊁ The list price of middle school textbooks before July was one yuan, and the actual price was 90% off, which is nine dimes. The industry rebate was up to 40%, and the average was 30%. After July, the actual price was nine dimes. The industry rebate was 15% in this city, and the highest was 15% outside the city. ㊁ The cost of textbooks is quite light. The cost of primary and secondary school textbooks is listed as an example on the left: (A) The third volume of the Business Elementary School Chinese uses thin kraft paper for the bottom and face, and white paper for the inside. The bottom and face account for four sides (ie two pages), and the heart accounts for seventy sides (ie thirty-five pages). Cost (1) White paper, 31 pieces, is used for a large sheet and 3/32. The current market price is five yuan per order (formerly only two yuan and three corners), which is 1.6 cents. (2) The bottom and face are made of thin kraft paper, 16 pieces, which is 1/16. The current market price is 16 yuan per order, which is one cent. (3) That is, the labor cost is one cent (printing cost is calculated at 80 cents per order, including the above number) (binding included). (4) Plate making fee is two li, editing fee is one li, and advertising fee is one li. The above costs a total of 1.8 cents per copy, and the actual selling price is 7 cents per copy. (5) The above fees are all calculated at 50,000 copies. If 500,000 to 1 million copies are printed, it will be less than this number. (B) The third volume of the Business Junior High School Chinese, (1) The bottom and face paper, nine pieces, costs three cents and three li. (2) The heart uses 70 pounds of white Daolin, one corner per pound, 14 yuan per order, counting 244 pages, each book uses four sheets of paper, costing one dime, one cent, and two li. (3) Printing cost (260 pages) is eight li. (4) The cost of typesetting (110,000 words) is two li (calculated by printing 5,000 copies). (5) The cost of editing and advertising is two li (calculated by 5,000 copies). The above costs a total of one dime, two cents, seven li, and three hairs per copy, and the current list price is nine dimes, and the actual selling price is eight dimes and one cent. According to the above calculation, not only does it violate the national government's stipulation that the interest rate should not exceed 20%, but it is now as high as 200% to 300%, which is really shocking. ㊃ Textbooks compiled by the Ministry of Education are compiled by the country, and now they also collect royalties, which is even more inappropriate and should be waived to promote popularization. ㊄ In the past, Shanghai organized literacy education. Mr. Tao Baichuan compiled the "Literacy Textbook." Various bookstores scrambled to sell it, and the result was obtained by the Business Bureau, which cost one cent per copy (at that time, the newspaper cost more than two yuan per order), which is enough to prove that the current sales of six cents, seven cents, and two is inappropriate.

### Municipal Social Bureau Bans Unsound Private Schools

The Municipal Social Bureau, in order to rectify private schools, investigates, inspects, urges improvements, and recently found that Shangren Elementary School, Qinghua Elementary School, Ziguang Elementary School on Pinlang Road, and Tongzhi Elementary School on Tianji Road are all poorly managed. It has ordered them to close down voluntarily.

### Japan's Modern Science Library Opened Yesterday

The Shanghai Japanese Modern Science Picture Library, which was funded by its government and organized by the Japanese in Shanghai, was established last autumn.

In the future, it plans to publish a Chinese-Japanese combined magazine, host academic lectures, and show science and culture films to introduce Japanese industry and academia. It is heard that Mr. Funatsu will invite people from all walks of life in this city to visit after returning to Shanghai from Japan in the near future.

Chairman Lin is the honorary chairman of this art exhibition, and Presidents Jiang and Cai, Yuan Pei, etc. are the vice-chairmen. Wang Shijie is the chairman, and Duan Xipeng and Qian Changzhao are the vice-chairmen. 6,000 exhibits were solicited, and more than 2,300 were selected. All are masterpieces of ancient and modern art. The venue is divided into six exhibition rooms: 1. Painting and Epigraphy, 2. Fine Arts and Crafts, 3. Antiques from the Academia Sinica, 4. Western Painting, Sculpture, Pattern. Architectural models, 5. Modern Calligraphy and Painting, 6. Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties. In addition, photography is displayed in the corridor. Special commissioners have been assigned and the military and police have been requested to be responsible for the reception and security matters at the venue. The Preparatory Committee held a plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 30th to report on the preparatory work, which was reported by Chairman Zhang Daofan.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th The second National Art Exhibition is scheduled to officially open on the 1st. The reporter specifically visited Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education on the 30th to ask for his opinions on this National Art Exhibition. He agreed to meet and gave a very eloquent speech. The main points are as follows: ㊀ The first National Art Exhibition was held in 1929. One of the purposes of this art exhibition is to examine the degree of progress and trends of art in our country in the past eight years in order to determine the plan for promoting art education in the future. ㊁ Art matters were often regarded as the facts of a few people or the aristocratic class in the past. The more people appreciate and identify with art, the greater and faster the progress will be. The direct purpose of holding this art exhibition is to arouse the public's interest in art and aesthetic ability, in order to gradually achieve the so-called popularization of art. Indirectly, it can encourage writers to improve their future art achievements. ㊂ The country is in serious trouble and the whole country is depressed. In order to prevent the people of the whole country from being overcome by any setbacks or troubles in this depressed atmosphere, and to always maintain their positive spirit of fighting to the end for the nation and for the doctrine, it is urgent to provide all staff with proper spiritual nourishment and spiritual adjustment. The appreciation of art can expand the mind of the appreciator and calm his temperament, which is just enough to meet this need. This art exhibition is held during a period of serious national crisis, and it has its own special significance. Furthermore, the scope of this art exhibition is quite wide, including calligraphy, photography, sculpture, architecture, patterns, fine arts, crafts, rare books, and epigraphy, etc. The exhibits include not only modern works, but also historical masterpieces of various public and private collections. Ancient art from the ruins of Yin and the Dunhuang Shibo has also been selected. The National Art occupies an important position in the history of world culture. Since the London Chinese Art Exhibition was held last year, it has been universally recognized by the world. The inclusion of ancient works in the conference aims to continue to promote the government authorities, and to continue to work hard by the wealthy generation of writers to extend the glory of our ancestors to infinity.

### Grain: Jin and Chu Compete for Supremacy, Wheat Flour Rises and Falls with Many Constraints

—May Futures to be Open for Trading Starting on the First—

Flour: Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for various months showed mixed gains and losses, with a trend of near-term weakness and long-term strength. In terms of foreign wheat quotations, during the market closure period, Chicago was still better by seven to eight jiao or so, while Canada rose by one yuan and forty-five jiao in the near term, and seven jiao in the long term. After the opening price, this month's initial opening was three yuan, nine jiao and three fen, but sales were sluggish, and the bulls retreated, immediately falling by one fen and seven li and a half. Therefore, the opening prices for July and August followed, slightly down by one fen or so. After the first trade, due to some floating short positions being covered, market sentiment stabilized, and factory owners also seized the opportunity to cover short positions, leading to a gradually improving situation, with prices rebounding by one fen and three fen from the lowest point. By the afternoon opening, this month's initial price remained stable, but later, as the bulls retreated, another factory sold short, and market sentiment gradually loosened. As for July and August, due to the cold weather, the bulls pushed up long-term prices, so the initial drop was followed by a rebound. As for the May standard, at the request of brokers and fixed clients, trading will resume on April 1st as usual. As for the trend this month, if actual sales remain inactive, the market is expected to remain flat or weak.

Wheat: Yesterday, at the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, prices for various months showed mixed gains and losses, while the afternoon futures showed a consistent strong trend. Although foreign wheat quotations continued to be good, ranging from seven to eight jiao to one yuan and forty-five jiao, the recent standards must depend on the flour market for direction. If northern sales are active, the wheat market will naturally follow, otherwise, given the experience of March, various parties are wary and dare not act rashly. The initial opening price for April was down by as much as one jiao and six fen due to the retreat of floating long positions. June and subsequent months also fell back by three or four fen due to near-term considerations. Later, with the absorption by northern buyers, the trend returned to strength. By the afternoon opening, the price trend for April was flat, while June and subsequent months rose by three to five fen as the flour market improved and the weather also changed. The current wheat supply is tight, and various factories are slightly eager to replenish their stocks, so various stalls have raised their prices by three to four fen. Fufeng and Shenda handled the purchase of three to four thousand bags.

Lian Dou Telegrams Frequent Rises

### Standard Soybean Oilcake Soars

—Recent Oil Rises Sharply by Seven Jiao—

Yesterday, the standard soybean oilcake market rose unanimously. Because the Dalian market had already risen during the market closure period, and the Lian Dou telegram reported a rise of about two jiao, people in Shanghai were excited. Brokers and retail customers dared not sell, while floating short positions and new entrants were active again. The market opened sharply higher in the morning, and the buying sentiment was particularly strong as the telegrams continued to be strong in the afternoon. Although there were no wholesale channels for spot goods, market prices and sentiment had already risen. Closing prices: standard oil up seven jiao this month, four and a half to four jiao for later months; standard beans up one jiao and three or four fen; standard cake up two or three fen.

### Guangdong Merchants Stop Buying Ke Xian Rice, Cargo Owners Still Seek to Sell

Yesterday, sales of Ke Xian rice from Guangdong improved, and the market weakened before stabilizing. Given the abundant harvest in various provinces along the Yangtze River last year and the ample supply in Shanghai, the market would have been difficult to stabilize. However, the Guangdong merchants were active, so they were able to support the market for half a year. Recently, the Guangdong merchants have completely stopped buying. There are rumors in the market that a large batch of foreign rice has arrived in Guangdong Province, but according to news from Guangdong Province yesterday, there are currently only a few small shipments, and wholesale shipments are still pending. However, because the Transportation and Sales Bureau, the Farmers' Foundation Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Regulation Committee are meeting to handle the import of one million shi of foreign rice and grains, applying for tax exemption, it may be possible. Therefore, the merchants dare not rashly buy again while their existing rice stocks have not yet been sold. With the Guangdong market stagnant, the Shanghai market immediately trended downward. Yesterday, there was active trading between local merchants and Quanzhou merchants, and the market was still able to support itself. However, cargo owners are still seeking to sell, and the outlook is not very optimistic. The total daily sales were 6,471 bags of Jiangxi rice, 340 bags of Hunan rice, and less than 2,000 bags of sales by Quanzhou merchants, with the rest being handled by local merchants.

### Thick and Thin Geng Rice Rebounds by One Jiao or So

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, nearly thirty shipments arrived from various sources, totaling sixty-odd dan of goods, with thick and thin Geng rice being comparable. Since the Foreign Rice Tax Exemption Petition Delegation arrived in Beijing, sentiment has stabilized somewhat. Moreover, it is heard that Xian rice markets in various provinces such as Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi have all risen, so sentiment has risen, prompting activity among urban and rural stores, and wholesale sales are also acceptable. It is estimated that Qingdao and other merchants handled more than three thousand bags of thin rice, leading to a tight situation, and the market is showing strength. The prices of thick and thin Geng rice have all risen by one jiao to beyond one jiao. However, due to unsuccessful price negotiations in the wholesale market, it is still difficult to estimate accurately. Dujian also improved by several fen. Only Yangjian and Yinbianyuan have similar supply and demand, with no gains or losses.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about thirty ships arrived from various merchants downstream. Trading in various goods was brisk on the market, with the price of top-grade white Geng rice rising by nearly one jiao, and the price of medium-grade rice rising by more than one jiao. The price of Yangdu Buxian rice rose by nearly one jiao, and the price of Yinbianyuan also tightened by several fen. The prices of other types of rice all rose by several fen to one jiao.

### Exchange Rate Rises, Foreign Exchange Market Tight in British, Flat in US

Yesterday, the exchange market rose due to the increase in exchange rates. The British market was tight, while the US market was flat. The overall trend was stable. In the morning, overseas silver markets were quoted against the closing rates. London large-denomination forwards were flat, New York silver prices were unchanged, and the Montreaux forward silver price narrowed by five hao to one li or so. British versus US rose by seven hao, British versus French fell by one centime, British versus Japanese was unchanged, US versus British rose by 0.1875, US versus French rose by 0.25, US versus Japanese rose by one li, and London spot gold rose by half a penny.

The opening selling price for near-term British exchange was one shilling, two pence, and 0.625, and the opening price for US exchange was 29.78125 yuan, which seemed tighter for British and looser for US compared to the previous closing rates. After the opening, the market gradually flattened out, with banks showing good appetite. Therefore, although Xiaoluson and Sassoon were sellers, HSBC posted the same British and American rates, and the silver balance tax remained unchanged. The intermediate process was still flat, and the same was true at midday. In the afternoon market, the US dollar continued to be weak. Banks took advantage of the low prices to maintain their positions, which was still supportable. Foreign firms also had some appetite, and the shilling weakened slightly, with similar results. The closing selling prices for near-term British exchange were one shilling, two pence, and 0.625, and the closing price for US exchange was 29.78125 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, the British exchange was slightly weaker, while the US dollar was flat. Sassoon Xinfeng slightly sold shillings. Here is a record of the day's transactions:

### Securities: March Government Bond Delivery and Its Process

Large Accounts Absorb, Market Price Turns From Low to High: Delivery Amount 8,085,000

Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange was the delivery date for March futures, and the market remained closed for one day. The total delivery amount was 22,890,000, of which 14,805,000 was settled through account transfers by brokers themselves, and 8,085,000 was delivered at the exchange. The surface delivery quantity was not large, but the quantity delivered off-exchange must have been large. The process of the market price for Type A bonds was uniquely sluggish. Because this time, 3.5 million yuan worth of Type A bonds were delivered for number 35, and number 20 received the most deliveries. The market price process lasted for a total of 39 days, including the Lunar New Year holiday. The initial market price for Type C bonds was only 62 yuan, and Type A bonds were 72 yuan when the March futures began on January 27. After the Lunar New Year red market, the market situation gradually improved. Although March was an ex-dividend market price, market sentiment improved due to preparations for reform, and market prices rose step by step. After about three weeks of hovering and brewing, the market situation suddenly turned bullish on March 17 and 18. Rumors spread in the market that the visit of Mr. Kodama or the economic aspects might be beneficial. Market sentiment was excited, and large accounts absorbed, which was very lively. The intensity of the bullishness was beyond expectation. By March 23, the last day of March, Type C bonds had risen to 70 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, with a difference of 8 yuan between the highest and lowest prices. The highest price for Type A bonds was only 76 yuan and 7 jiao, with a difference of only 4 yuan and a half between the highest and lowest prices. Therefore, the futures for April and May continued to rise, and the situation was excellent, with a tendency to rise rather than fall. Today is the end of the holiday, and the market will open as usual, which will be lively. The delivery, account transfer, and total transaction volume are listed separately below (unit: 100 yuan).

### Yarn and Cotton: Overview of Yarn and Cotton Delivery

Quantity: Cotton Increased, Yarn Decreased

Yarn: The March futures for Golden Rooster yarn opened on October 1 last year at 210 yuan, and fell slightly to 205 yuan. Subsequently, due to the well-distributed rainfall in the country and the abundant harvest of agricultural products, autumn sales gradually developed. In addition, due to business difficulties, many yarn factories suspended operations and reduced working hours in July and August, and cotton yarn production was drastically reduced. Therefore, speculators, seeing the favorable environment, raised prices against each other, and new peaks appeared one after another. By October 19, the panic of the short positions reached its peak. The prices for each month soared by 8 yuan and 8 jiao, and a suspension of trading was announced. Yarn sales continued to be active. The price rose again to the upper limit on December 1. The peak was once seen at 251 yuan on January 8. Later, with the suspension of yarn sales at the beginning and end of the Lunar New Year, yarn factories fully increased spindles and started production, and the Indian merchants sent bulls to sell short. On March 3, the low price reached 234 yuan and 9 jiao again, but Bian Shao, seeing that spring sales had not yet occurred, tightened his hold and rose again to 45 yuan and 2 jiao. The final price was 242 yuan, 32 yuan higher than the opening price. As a result, 11,150 bales remained to be delivered, a decrease of 12,350 bales compared to the previous month. The delivery price, calculated based on the last three days, was 243 yuan, 12 yuan lower than in October. 10-count yarns accounted for the majority of the delivered goods, and 20-count yarns were also substantial. The brand names and quantities of the brokers on both the receiving and delivering sides are listed below.

▲Delivering Party for Marked Yarn

▲Receiving Party for Marked Yarn

Cotton: The March futures for marked cotton opened on October 1 last year at 41 yuan and 3 jiao, falling to 40 yuan. Afterwards, due to the improvement in yarn sales and the soaring yarn prices, the interdependent cotton market was brought into a better situation, and the market also moved forward. Unfortunately, domestic production was abundant, and cotton stocks from all sources were abundant, so the upward pressure was not as strong as in the yarn market. The peak was once seen at 45 yuan and 2 jiao on December 14, but ultimately, due to the thick stocks of blended cotton and sluggish demand from factories, the price slowly fell back to 42 yuan and a half. Recently, US cotton has risen step by step, and is currently rising to 1 jiao and 5 fen, causing market turmoil and rising to 474 yuan and 8 jiao and a half. The final closing price was 44 yuan and 4 jiao, 3 yuan and 1 jiao higher than the opening price. As a result, 63,800 dan remained, an increase of 14,800 dan compared to the previous month. The delivery price, calculated based on the last three days, was 44 yuan, 1 yuan higher than the previous month. The delivered goods included Hankou cotton, Shashi cotton, Huoji cotton, and Lingbao cotton, all of which were taken in by arbitrageurs. The brand names and quantities of the brokers on both the receiving and delivering sides are listed below.

### During Five-Day Holiday, 1,600 Bales of Spot Yarn Opened

Yesterday, the Yarn and Cloth Exchange held the March delivery and closed the market as usual. The spot market met as usual, and spot yarn trading was still good. Selling prices rose by 2 yuan to 3 yuan. The quantities traded by each merchant are listed below.

Trading was not much during the holiday. Only Tianjin merchants imported 650 bales of 16-count Airplane, Double Dragon, Peacock, and Jincheng yarns, and the same merchants imported 107 bales of 20-count Double Deer and other yarns.

### Factories Compete to Buy Lingbao Cotton

Spot cotton sales are still good. Because foreign cotton is rising and spot yarn is rising, the situation is firm and rising, but factories are unwilling to accept high prices because they still have abundant cotton stocks. Therefore, it is not easy to conclude deals when asking prices are higher. Yesterday, the factories mostly purchased Lingbao cotton. The quantities and prices are listed on the left.

### US Cotton Merchants Await Developments in Pledged Cotton and Labor Strikes

Indian Cotton Falls by 1-2 Rupees

Yesterday, at the opening of the US cotton market, prices fell by 1 pound of sound to rose by 5 pounds of sound for each month. Before noon, trading was not much, and prices were weak due to the liquidation of long positions and the sale of cotton farmers, but brokers and the New Orleans consortium bought in unison, so the market situation immediately recovered. Afterwards, the market situation was mixed, with limited new accounts. The industry is awaiting the progress of pledged cotton and labor strikes. Spot cotton is firm, and the cloth market is firm but stagnant. At the close, short accounts covered at low prices, foreign merchants bought in, and market prices rose again. Spot goods rose by 3 pounds of sound, and futures rose by 3 to 9 pounds of sound. With the US cotton market closed, Indian cotton initially rose due to speculative buying, but fell back due to unfavorable telegrams from New York. Transactions were few. Pingguoer was unchanged, Aomula fell by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.75 to 2 rupees, according to the original telegram on the left (telegram of the 29th).

It is also heard that the Mumbai telegram forecast the opening on the 30th, with Bailuoxi at 243.25 rupees, Pingguoer at 199.5 rupees, both up by half a rupee, and Aomula at 230.5 rupees, unchanged.

### Rise and Fall of Grade-Three Yarn and Cotton Market?

Osaka telegram of the 30th: spot yarn fell by 1 yuan, 16-count fan surface at 251 yuan, 20-count goldfish at 272 yuan, both up by 1 yuan, 40-count five-star at 403 yuan, 42-count pheasant at 392 yuan, both unchanged. Grade-three futures yarn fell by 1 to 4 jiao, with near-term at 266.9 yuan and far-term at 263.4 yuan. Futures cotton rose by 1 jiao and 5 fen to fell by 1 jiao, with near-term at 80.55 yuan and far-term at 82.25 yuan.

### Qingdao Yarn Market: Futures Up, Spot Down

Qingdao telegram of the 30th from the same alliance: Songlu marked yarn on the Qingdao Exchange rose by 4.5 to 5 yuan, and marked cloth rose by 1 jiao, according to the original telegram record on the left.

### Piece Goods: White Goods Selling Prices Rise One After Another

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was due to holiday closure, but foreign cotton of all three grades were rising. East-made fine cloth and fine twill saw good sales. Sentiment among industry players was firm and rising, so the selling prices of white goods in the morning market rose unanimously. Fine cloth rose by 5 fen (per piece), and fine twill rose by 7.5 fen to 1 jiao. This was because sales of military uniform dye blanks continued to be strong, and bottoms were particularly scarce. Changzhou factory twill was actually higher than last week by over 2 jiao (per piece). Heavyweight coarse cloth from Shenxin, Zhentai, and other brands of this factory were increasingly depleted, and the increase in unified tax was about to be implemented, so market sentiment was even stronger. Selling prices rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half per piece. Yihua 16-pound coarse cloth increased its asking price by 2 jiao, 13-pound and 11-pound increased by 1 jiao, and 9-pound increased by 5 fen (per piece). Wholesale merchants in this street absorbed more than 600 bales of coarse cloth of various grades. There are approximately 1,000 bales of dye blanks, fine cloth, and fine twill in the current futures market. The best in terms of sales was the Yangtze River merchant, and the demand from the northern regions of Yantai, Qingdao, Jinan, and Jinjie was still strong. Merchants from Ningbo and Shaoxing also handled more than 300 bales of coarse cloth.

### Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Decline Consistently

Local Japanese Factories Follow Down by 5-10 Yuan

Yesterday, the silk market resumed operations after the Spring Festival holiday, and Western merchants and foreign firms resumed normal business. According to Reuters, silk prices in Japan and the US all declined consistently after the customs opening. Yesterday, the near-term and far-term prices of standard silk in New York each fell by a massive 9.5 fen (compared to the market of March 25, other holding prices such as Japanese silk at 0.83 and Shanghai silk, etc., were not changed). The spot market price in Yokohama yesterday, compared to the market before the holiday, showed spot prices down by 50 yuan and futures down by 2-3 yuan. In the Lyon silk market, Japanese silk fell by 4.25 francs, Shanghai silk A-grade was unchanged, B-grade fell by 1 franc, and Guangdong silk fell by 1.5 francs. The Shanghai silk market was difficult to trade due to the low prices of overseas supplies (such as ordinary white factory silk without uniformity only costing 700 yuan). However, Indian Zhuang Chuanjing slightly purchased user silk. The Hangzhou merchant was still purchasing substantially, but the market price decreased by 5-10 yuan or so. A total of 57 bales were sold yesterday.

### North and South Goods: Gold Needle Vegetable Market Difficult to Loosen Again

Recently, the sales of gold needle vegetables have been sluggish, and market prices have gradually fallen back, with ordinary ones once entering the 20 yuan range. However, the current price level has reached a considerable point, and sellers are unwilling to loosen further, gradually showing stability. Yesterday, it was heard that 70-odd bags had been opened, with higher ones at 20 yuan and 8 jiao, followed by 20 yuan and 5-6 jiao, and ordinary ones at 19 yuan and 8 jiao, 4-5 jiao better than the previous time. If inventory consumption is activated, it may need to be tightened again. The market price for top Zhuang vegetable is called at 21 yuan and a half, followed by 20 yuan and 19 yuan and a half.

### Sugar Market: Dongbai Discount Continues Slightly by 5 Fen

Yesterday, there was not much movement in the sugar market. The association's discounts, such as spot and re-export goods for 24 coarse white, were unchanged. Spot 8-number Dongbai was at 12 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, 9-number was at 12 yuan and 2 jiao, a slight discount of 5 fen continued. The remaining prices were quoted at the original prices. Among the Benchang mian, Zhenji 1-number was at 21 yuan and a half, and 2,3,4,5 numbers were discounted accordingly. Only the Da merchant opened up dozens of boxes of mixed-brand Da ice, with prices as before, unchanged.

### Hardware: White Lead Sheet Footing Firm and Rising

Since the lead sheet market has been firm overseas for several days, yesterday, Reuters reported that goods produced by Bide were all purchased by Japan, so there were no goods that could come to China, and the goods produced by the UK and US were not much. Therefore, the market is very strong, and the footing is as strong as steel and other products. As for the recent situation in the Shanghai market, the market situation is relatively quiet because actual sales have turned sluggish, but the hoarding account is mostly absorbing, and industry players are also mostly monopolizing, so the market price is exceptionally strong. Number 2 opens at 210 yuan, number 3 at 200 yuan, number 4 at 195 yuan, number 5 and 6 at 190 yuan, number 7 at 185 yuan, and number 8, 9, and 10 all open at 178 yuan. The price for quasi-color opens from 180 yuan to 200 yuan. It is found that yesterday's market成交 totalled 600-700 buckets.

### Industrial Exhibition

—Yang An

Shanghai is the industrial center of the country. What is the state of Shanghai's industrial progress? This is well worth a look. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs is preparing to hold a large-scale Shanghai Municipal Industrial Exhibition. This is the best way to promote industrial technology and to draw the public's attention to domestic industrial goods, and is by no means comparable to ordinary gatherings.

We believe that there are three points to pay attention to at the beginning of the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Exhibition.

First, the items collected for this time must pay attention to the grade and quality standards of domestic goods, and must be carefully selected, and must not be abused. If there is any doubt, a field investigation must be conducted to ensure that there is no doubt before it can be selected. If there is only a sales store number and no factory, it will not be accepted. If there is the form of a factory, but there is actually no working technology, it will not be accepted. If it is purely foreign technicians and foreign raw materials, it will not be accepted. Because Shanghai is the focus of attention from all countries, and is watched by all eyes, if there is any place for fraud, it will not only damage its reputation, but also be despised and laughed at by various countries.

Second, since it is called the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Exhibition, then all the products of Shanghai factories are of course in the scope of collection. It is not appropriate to collect too much, and it is also not appropriate to omit any. Therefore, during the preparation, it is best to focus on investigation work, and all industrial products that are valuable and worth exhibiting should be collected in many ways to avoid omission. Products that are creative inventions with promotional value should be especially displayed to attract attention.

Third, the classification of the collected items must be paid great attention to, so that the audience can see at a glance and will not be confused. The method of display is best to adopt the method of manufacturing process. For example, for wool textiles, it can start from wool and end with the production of woolen cloth. The intermediate steps can all be displayed and explained. This not only shows the manufacturing method, but also shows the quality of the technology, and also allows the public to understand the production steps and strengthen their confidence in using domestic goods. The problems of abuse and falsehood can also be avoided, which is very important.

In short, the holding of an industrial exhibition is an important matter. The prior investigation, collection, classification, review, selection, the on-site display, arrangement, the post-event evaluation, research, and awards, etc., all require strict procedures and scientific methods to achieve perfection. The industrial community is even more in need of enthusiastic participation and enthusiastic assistance to complete this great undertaking.

### Salt Quality and Dental Hygiene

— Xiang Rong

Among the human body's tissues, the hardest is probably teeth. Logically, since teeth are the hardest, they should be the least prone to damage. However, the reality is quite different. According to expert statistics, tooth decay is widespread throughout the world, affecting at least 60% of the total population.

This is because, although teeth are hard, there are several things that easily damage them. First are acids, especially lactic acid, which is present in sugary substances. If it remains in our mouths, it can gradually erode the enamel on our teeth, causing it to flake off. Once the dentin underneath is exposed, the nerves inside our teeth will begin to ache. Second are microorganisms, which constantly produce toxins on our teeth. These not only damage our teeth but also cause problems in the mouth and the entire body. Third is tartar, which preserves acids and microorganisms that decay teeth. Because of these three things, human teeth suffer significant damage.

To avoid this damage, the most important thing is to pay attention to the hygiene of the teeth and mouth. Brushing teeth is, of course, essential, and the use of dental cleaning products is indispensable every day.

Regarding dental cleaning products, in terms of nature, there are various types such as toothpaste, tooth powder, and mouthwash. In terms of materials, there are various ingredients such as mint, calcium carbonate, chalk, and alkaline substances. However, according to modern scientific research, salt is also one of the best dental cleaning products. First, salt can neutralize acidic substances in our mouths, preventing them from harming the enamel on our teeth. Second, salt has strong antibacterial properties; it is commonly used as a preservative. Therefore, it can kill microorganisms in our mouths without harming our bodies. Third, it has the effect of removing tartar. In addition, it can also eliminate bad breath, which is extremely important for protecting oral hygiene.

In fact, the significant effect of salt on dental hygiene has long been noted in our country. Many people use table salt to brush their teeth, which is clear evidence. However, it has not been scientifically formulated, which is of course a deficiency. As far as I know, the Tanggu Jiuda Refined Salt Company has used salt to produce Neptune toothpaste, tooth powder, and mouthwash. However, these products are common in the north but not yet widespread in the south. It is said that they have a good effect on cleaning teeth.

Therefore, we should not only know that salt is essential for maintaining life but also understand its significant relationship to dental hygiene.

### A Brief Discussion on Sales Promotion (5)

— Ding Kai

㊂ A Perspective on Gimmick Sales Tactics

We often see certain goods or companies relying on novel ideas and endless "tricks" to promote their products, or focusing on methods like "low prices" and prize-winning "lotteries." The business itself may either achieve success by chance, remain stagnant, or even be affected negatively. The costs of sales promotion (auxiliary costs), such as advertising and giveaways, may actually increase as a result. This is what people in Shanghai commonly call "gimmicks."

Based on people's inherent desires for stimulation and novel experiences, any such sensations can certainly create a temporary demand. However, as circumstances change, they become relics of the past. We understand that the establishment of commercial and industrial enterprises is primarily aimed at creating a foundation. While temporary stimulation may be suitable, it is not a sustainable basis for permanent growth. I will now analyze this from different perspectives:

Sales Promotion ㊀ Appealing Gimmicks ㊁ Price Reductions to Lure Customers ㊂ Giveaways to Attract Customers ㊃ Lotteries to Create Excitement
The Motives Stem from the Desire to Boost Sales, Win Competitive Advantages, or Reduce Excess Inventory
The Benefits Are Limited to the Short Term

The author does not fundamentally oppose the use of gimmicks. In fact, I strongly advocate for the implementation of innovative methods to support the foundation of goods sales. I often secretly observe businesses that employ these methods and, based on my experience, have reached the following conclusions:

㊀ As a short-term measure, it is beneficial without drawbacks and can create opportunities for products to imprint on consumers' minds.

㊁ For clearing out inventory, it can be used temporarily to gain an advantage.

㊂ For opening up new markets and providing temporary assistance in advertising.

㊃ For maintaining existing markets and stimulating the metabolism of old and new products.

The conclusion is that these are "temporary dynamics" and cannot be considered permanent sales plans.

### Explanation of the Pocket-Sized Folding Umbrella for Both Sunny and Rainy Days

— Gong Xinglei

Purpose of Creating a Folding Umbrella

Umbrellas are everyday items, but because the weather is unpredictable, with both sun and rain, carrying an umbrella while traveling can be cumbersome. I, therefore, decided to reform the umbrella so that it could be stored in a bag when not in use, making it easier to carry. Thus, the pocket-sized folding umbrella was created.

How to Use the Folding Umbrella

When using the umbrella, align the notch on the edge of the outer shell of the sliding ring with the spring pin in the middle partition. Then, use your right hand to pull out the contracted umbrella handle, and use your left hand to take the sliding ring and push it upward until the spring on the sliding ring is controlled. The umbrella will then be fully opened.

When retracting the umbrella, use your right hand to take the umbrella handle and your left hand to take the sliding ring. Then, turn your right hand to the left and your left hand to the right until it stops. Push the sliding ring downward and push the umbrella handle inward at the same time. When not in use, tie the strap tightly and then put it in a thin rubber bag.

There are four steps for using the umbrella:

㊀ Align the notch on the edge of the outer shell of the sliding ring with the spring pin in the middle partition.

㊁ Loosen the umbrella cloth.

㊂ Use your right hand to pull out the contracted umbrella handle, and use your left hand to take the sliding ring and push it upward, keeping the top of the umbrella facing upward, until the spring control ring is reached.

㊃ After opening, it is similar to a regular umbrella.

Materials of the Folding Umbrella

Steel sheets are ordered from a steel factory, which are specifically made for folding umbrellas. After quenching, the outer layer is hard, and the center is still tough. Steel that is not easily rusted even when wet is most suitable. The umbrella handle and sliding ring should be made of a net material to make the umbrella light and sturdy. However, the thickest section of the umbrella handle should be made of a material similar to bakelite to make it non-slip and more aesthetically pleasing. The umbrella cloth can be made of domestically produced silk or a material of similar quality. All of the above parts should be ordered from the raw material factory, otherwise, the cost of labor and materials will be high.

Manufacturing of the Folding Umbrella

All parts must be manually assembled, but the rest can be manufactured by machines.

Size and Weight of the Pocket-Sized Folding Umbrella

(Large, for men) The diameter after retraction can be reduced to 1.5 inches, the length is 9.3 inches, and the weight is 1 pound, which is 6 ounces lighter than a regular umbrella (produced by the Shanghai Fuxin Factory). The size after opening is the same as a regular umbrella.

(Small, for women) The diameter after retraction can be reduced to 1.1 inches, the length is 9.3 inches, and the weight is a little over 9 ounces. The diameter after opening is 36 inches.

### The Decline of H鹽 Sea Salt Silk Fabric in Agriculture (Part 2)

— Zhu Qin

However, even though the price of this silk fabric is so low that it cannot be reduced any further, the dumping of foreign goods and fabrics into our inland rural areas has resulted in some being sold for only a few cents per foot. Because farmers are greedy for the cheap prices and beautiful patterns of foreign goods, they all flock to buy them, abandoning local silk fabrics. Local silk fabrics have plain colors and complicated weaving methods. Therefore, due to the impact of the foreign fabric market in recent years, farmers there are already considering giving up weaving altogether.

Mr. Ren also said: "I am willing to invest in rural areas, promote domestic silk fabrics, establish a model silk weaving factory in the area, develop rural industry, and use scientific methods to improve the speed of production, the quality, and the beauty of the patterns. The various silk fabrics produced will surely develop day by day. In a few years, it will not be difficult to become the iron army of domestic silk fabrics."

Overall, the development of the rural sideline silk fabric industry in Haiyan is gradually declining. At the same time, the threat of foreign goods makes it impossible for local silk fabrics to develop. Indeed, our government authorities and local leaders should quickly devise remedies. There is an urgent need to develop and manufacture goods to develop China's rural industry and increase domestic goods.

### A Visit to the Yixin Toothbrush Factory

— Liang Tongfang

Toothbrushes are one of the necessities of daily life. Because they are closely related to human hygiene, they are indispensable. The breadth of their sales is self-evident.

Before 1925, the toothbrushes sold in the Chinese market, apart from a very few domestic toothbrushes that were of poor quality and clumsy design, were all imported. The annual outflow of money was considerable.

In 1925, Mr. Wen Shaohe and Mr. Dai Zhicheng, in view of the lack of domestic toothbrush factories and to promote the scientific manufacturing of toothbrushes, raised funds to establish the Yixin Toothbrush Factory on Huining Road, Xieqiao, in the Nanshi district of Shanghai. It now has more than 300 workers, and its products are trademarked "Yixin."

The raw materials for toothbrushes are cattle bones and pig bristles. Pig bristles are purchased from Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and other provinces, and cattle bones are also domestically sourced. The toothbrush manufacturing process can be roughly divided into two parts: bristle washing and bone making. Bristle washing involves using chemical agents to bleach the pig bristles white and then dividing them into various types according to thickness, length, softness, and hardness. As for the process of making bones into toothbrushes, it is very complicated. I will now write about it roughly below: First, the cow leg bones are sawn into the length of a toothbrush. They are split into the shape of a toothbrush, and the bone material is polished. Many eye holes for threading the bristles are made with a machine, and several very long vertical holes are made at the top of the toothbrush. In this way, when threading the bristles, the thread can be threaded out from the vertical holes without being exposed on the outside. This is called the hidden threading method. That step is relatively difficult. The next procedure is to grind and cut the bone material to make it flat, smooth, and the same as an ordinary toothbrush. Then, it is boiled in chemical agents for five or six hours to remove the toxins from the bone material. Then, the bristles are threaded, and the threaded bristles are cut flat, or the middle part of the bristles is cut short so that the top and tail protrude. This is more elaborate because, when brushing teeth, the protruding part of the toothbrush can easily brush away dirt and food debris from the gaps between the teeth. The vertical holes of the hidden-threaded toothbrush must also be filled in so that the thread is not exposed on the outside, and the bristles must be straightened and washed clean. Finally, the trademark is printed on the toothbrush handle, and it is polished to make the toothbrush more shiny. Before packing and shipping, a rigorous inspection procedure is carried out to remove damaged toothbrushes, and the finished toothbrushes are disinfected again to avoid sticking to unclean dust. The above-mentioned manufacturing procedures, except for threading the bristles, are all made by machines. Therefore, with division of labor and cooperation, the output is very rapid.

In addition to paying attention to never losing bristles, the machine-made toothbrushes of the Yixin Toothbrush Factory have many other characteristics: ㊀ They are manufactured using new-style machines, and the products are neat and excellent. ㊁ They use high-quality raw materials and have excellent quality. ㊂ The work is done entirely by workers with more than five years of experience, so the work efficiency is fast, and the products are exceptionally exquisite. ㊃ There are many styles, some are made in Western style, and some are designed independently, or they are identified by dentists, with as many as fifty or more types. Men, women, old, and young, each have various toothbrushes that are suitable for them, making them comfortable to use. ㊄ All products must undergo several boilings, bleaching, and thorough disinfection. After being tested and certified by dentists, they are extremely hygienic. ㊅ The bristles are threaded using the hidden threading method, which makes it difficult to lose bristles and hide dirt, making them smooth and comfortable to use. ㊆ The packaging is exquisite, and the sealing is complete and tight, so dust and bacteria cannot enter.

Just mentioning the above few advantages, the exquisiteness and practicality of Yixin brand toothbrushes are worth recommending to readers.

I sincerely hope that Sino-Swedish relations will become closer and that the Swedish embassy in China will be established soon." Chairman Wang immediately replied, stating, "Sino-Swedish relations have always been close. Your country has made great contributions in science, industry, and commerce, which we have always admired.

### Shanghai Consular Corps Hosted a Farewell Banquet for Mayor Wu Yesterday

Expressing Sympathy and Understanding to Each Other at the Banquet, The Silver Plate Will Remain a Lasting Remembrance

The consuls-general and consuls of various countries in Shanghai hosted a banquet for Mayor Wu at the American Club on Sima Road last night (the 30th).

They also invited Chinese and foreign guests to accompany them. More than 100 people attended. At the banquet, the leader of the Consular Corps, Norwegian Consul-General Erle, delivered a speech on behalf of all, praising Mayor Wu's achievements in Shanghai and expressing the admiration of foreigners. He also presented a silver plate on behalf of the consuls-general and their wives as a memento. Mayor Wu then delivered a response in English, expressing his gratitude for the grand banquet. He said that he felt very sad and indescribable as he was about to leave Shanghai. Mr. Erle said that his departure from Shanghai to Guangdong was a loss for Shanghai and a gain for Guangdong. But he believed that his departure from Shanghai was his loss, and no one else would gain anything. Because in Guangdong, there will always be a chairman who is better than him, while he will be separated from his good friends. This loss is irreparable. He said that the reason why he took up his post in Guangdong was that he could not disobey the government's orders. Looking back over the past five years, he was deeply impressed by the broad-minded attitude, sympathy, understanding, and ever-ready cooperation of his foreign friends. The past five years have been full of hardships, but they have never failed to receive generous understanding and sympathy. This is due to the spirit of mutual understanding and consideration. The pleasant and friendly relationship between the Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai has always been a source of pride for him. This is undoubtedly due to the guidance and encouragement of the consuls and related foreigners. The fact that there are three municipal governments in one corner of Shanghai naturally creates an unusual situation. In the past, the three municipal governments were seen as standing in opposition to each other, competing with each other. This situation has now completely changed. They are now gradually moving towards the point where they must combine their strength and share the difficulties. This trend, although slow, is gradually progressing. The spirit of close cooperation has been demonstrated in extremely difficult circumstances. He dared to say that, on more than one occasion, they have proved that they can put aside petty difficulties when necessary and work together for the overall well-being of Shanghai. He believed that now is the time for them to think and plan for the entire people of Shanghai. He thanked the friends for giving him the silver plate and said that he would always cherish this plate as a souvenir of the friends' love for him and their friendship. His wife was unable to attend the banquet due to health reasons, and he hoped that they would understand. Finally, he would like to thank the friends for their kindness again and wish them good health. In another news report, Arnold, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, sent a letter to Mayor Wu the other day to congratulate him on his new position. Mayor Wu replied with a letter of thanks, which is translated as follows: "Dear Mr. Chairman, I have received your kind letter and am deeply grateful for the congratulations from you and all the directors. I feel very happy and appreciative of the kindness and concern shown by you when I leave Shanghai. The fact that the authorities of the concession have always cooperated with me willingly and that the relationship between the two sides is harmonious is something that I will always remember. To Mr. Arnold, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council."

### City Government Colleagues Held Farewell Banquet for Mayor Wu Yesterday Afternoon

Yu Hongjun and Huang Boqiao Gave Farewell Speeches; Mayor Wu Responded with Words of Encouragement

All colleagues of the Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus held a banquet at noon yesterday in the auditorium of the Municipal Government to bid farewell to Mayor Wu. The hall was filled with convivial toasts and bustling activity. The City Police Bureau band played music, creating a lively atmosphere. First, Acting Mayor Yu delivered a farewell speech, followed by an introduction of Huang Boqiao, former Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and current Director of the Two-Roads Administration, who also gave a farewell speech. Finally, Mayor Wu delivered his response. The speeches of Yu, Huang, and Wu are recorded separately below:

Mr. Yu's Speech: Acting Mayor Yu began by delivering a farewell speech, stating that Mayor Wu had been ordered to take up a post in the Guangdong Provincial Government. The colleagues of this government, under the leadership of Mayor Wu, have served the local community of this city for many years. Now that we are parting ways, we feel a sense of melancholy. In a few days, Mayor Wu will leave Shanghai to take up his new post. Therefore, the colleagues of the Municipal Government have initiated this farewell banquet. Mayor Wu has taken time out of his busy schedule to attend, and our attachment is hard to express in words. Mayor Wu's great personality, far-sighted vision, broad-minded attitude, and patriotic spirit are well-known to his friends and colleagues, and are also widely understood by people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign. I saw a Western newspaper article that regarded Mayor Wu's transfer to the chairmanship of Guangdong Province as "Shanghai's loss and Guangdong's gain." Today, we are parting with a good official, which is naturally depressing and unpleasant. However, Mayor Wu's trip is also for the service of the Party and the country. In the future, we will still be able to receive his guidance from time to time. We have benefited from Mayor Wu's kindness in the past, and we will still be able to hear his great teachings in the future. Although we are separated physically, our spirits remain united, so we can still be optimistic about the future of this city, he said.

Mr. Huang's Speech: Huang Boqiao then delivered a speech, stating,

Today, I am very fortunate to participate in this grand farewell banquet for Mayor Wu as a former colleague. The establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government has been ten years to date. In these ten years, the mayor has changed four times, and Mayor Wu has served the longest term. Recalling that since Mayor Wu took office, the 'January 28th Incident' occurred, he was able to work hard and endure hardship, dealing with this great difficulty with a calm and composed spirit. Recalling that at that time, each bureau had a joint office, Mayor Wu handed me a handwritten order to immediately rescue the refugees in the war zone. I still keep this handwritten order to this day, which shows that Mayor Wu, even when diplomacy was very tense, the military was very urgent, and the economy was in a very difficult situation, was still able to take care of the safety of the citizens. His concern for the citizens can be seen from this. Today, as we hold this grand event in this magnificent auditorium, we cannot help but think of Mayor Wu's efforts in municipal construction over the past few years. After the 'January 28th' catastrophe, Mayor Wu was still able to devote himself wholeheartedly to promoting various important constructions. Today, the magnificent buildings in the central area of the city stand tall, and various undertakings for the benefit of the citizens are also being carried out one by one. Now, the plan for Greater Shanghai has taken shape, and people from all walks of life, especially Europeans and Americans, unanimously sing praises. Mayor Wu's departure from Shanghai to Guangdong is certainly a loss for Shanghai, but a gain for Guangdong. As the Chinese say, "Guan Yin of the South Sea," Guangdong has suffered considerable losses in the twenty years since the rise of the revolutionary army. Now, our Mayor Wu, like Guan Yin of the South Sea, will surely benefit the South Sea and be able to save the people of Guangdong Province with his spirit of great compassion. Finally, I raise my glass to wish him: 1. Good health, 2. All the best, 3. Bon voyage.

Mayor's Reply: Mayor Wu then delivered a response, stating, Today, I am grateful for the kindness of my colleagues in holding this farewell banquet. Such a banquet is due to our separation, and at a time of separation, the emotions are naturally different from usual. Especially today's farewell marks my separation from colleagues who have shared weal and woe for five or six years, and there must be an even more difficult to express sadness. I recall that when I took office as mayor, it had not been three weeks before the unprecedented disaster, the 'January 28th Incident,' occurred. This kind of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity can either make people more determined to save the situation, or it can make people avoid difficulties and give up on themselves. I dared not give up on myself after taking office. The more serious the difficulties, the more my sense of responsibility was encouraged. After the end of the war, we recovered the lost land, handled the aftermath of the war zone, and carried out the reconstruction of the war zone. Then, we worked hard to develop the central area of the city and gradually realize it. This achievement is not the result of my efforts alone, but the result of the hard work of the previous mayors and the consistent efforts of the colleagues of the Municipal Government over the past ten years. Especially during my tenure, the continuous efforts of the colleagues of the Municipal Government and the unanimous support of people from all walks of life have made this achievement possible, and I have not failed in my duties. This is something that I am fortunate to have for the rest of my life. Now, the Chinese and Western media and the general public have expressed considerable satisfaction with the recent progress of the city's construction. I am very happy, but there are still many undertakings that have not been carried out, which still require our efforts. After this extremely difficult encounter, it is enough to encourage me how to deal with major responsibilities in the future, and how to be more loyal to the duties of officials and the duties of the people, and to make contributions to the Party and the country in the future. This transfer to the chairmanship of Guangdong Province, Guangdong is a part of China, and it is no different from serving Shanghai. However, first, Shanghai is my second hometown. I have served in Shanghai for six years and lived in Shanghai for nearly twenty years. Especially in the past six years, I have shared weal and woe with Shanghai, especially the Shanghai that suffered severe national disasters. Once separated, there will be endless emotions. Second, in these five or six years, the Shanghai Municipal Government has made considerable progress with the efforts of its colleagues and the support of the citizens of the city. However, in the past, there were still many undertakings, some of which were in the process of design, and some of which were in the process of construction, but they have not been completed. These undertakings are of great importance to the spiritual and material aspects of the citizens, and our municipal party bureau should strive to carry them out. In the future, I will not be able to directly participate in these matters with my colleagues and work together. This is what makes me feel sad at the time of parting. However, the Shanghai Municipal Government has its unique points among the local administrative organs in the country. First, the Municipal Government has its consistent and fixed plans and policies, which are implemented in stages and gradually realized. Now, in these ten years, no matter which mayor, they all follow the rules. Second, for the past ten years, most of the staff of the Shanghai Municipal Government have worked hard according to the rules until now, and have not changed due to the departure of the mayor, so that the colleagues can be stable. This is enough to increase administrative efficiency, and it is rare in other places. At the beginning of my tenure, I also followed the good rules and models of the previous mayors, and everything proceeded as usual. Now, after the good rules and models of the previous mayors and the careful efforts of all the colleagues, a foundation has been laid. Therefore, I hope that the successor mayor will also follow this principle and work hard. The future of Shanghai will definitely have great hope and great progress. Finally, what I have particularly felt in these six years and what I want to particularly mention here is that ㊀ Shanghai used to be dominated by the concessions, but today everyone knows that the Municipal Government is the main body, which makes Shanghai's position more and more upright, and makes the general public know that the Municipal Government can indeed work for the welfare of the citizens and can indeed work hard for modern construction. ㊁ In recent years, colleagues have worked hard to promote service to the society, and the general public has been able to revitalize this spirit, so that the government and the people are united and the whole society is united. ㊂ In recent years, citizen training and student training have been held, which has made the customs of the citizens change day by day, strengthened the people's patriotic confidence, and increased the people's organizational strength. It is rare to achieve this result in this complex and chaotic city. Therefore, when I reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, I specifically reported this matter. The Chairman also appreciated it very much. We are very pleased to have this harvest. In the future, when I go to Guangdong to take up my post and go to Nanjing to report, I can always meet with you when I pass through Shanghai. I also hope that you will give me assistance at any time if Guangdong Province will need Shanghai's help in the future. Finally, I express my gratitude. After the meal, the meeting was adjourned.

Cantonese Public Banquet: The Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Association • Guangzhao Public Association • Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation • Chaozhou Guildhall • Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Association, five organizations initiated and scheduled to jointly hold a banquet for Mayor Wu at 7:00 pm on March 31 at the Dadong Restaurant on Nanjing Road. Fellow villagers who wish to participate can register at the above five national body offices or the Ningbo Road Taihe Xing Bank before March 31, so that seats can be reserved and tickets can be collected. It is thought that there will be a lively affair.

### Citizens' Branch Sent a Letter to Arnold

Criticizing Improper Handling of Increased Donations

According to New Voice News, the United Association of Citizens of the First Special Zone of this city, the branch associations of the seventh, twelfth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-seventh, thirty-sixth, thirty-eighth, forty-second, and other more than ten districts, jointly sent a letter to Arnold, the Director General of the Public Works Bureau, yesterday morning, saying, "Dear Sir, Mr. Arnold, you have been in charge of the Public Works Bureau for only two years, but from the various measures taken, the welfare of the principals has been considered empty or real or counterproductive. The proposal to increase donations can better make people recognize its courage, but it must be told to Mr. Arnold that public undertakings and private undertakings must have the courage to deal with them, but this kind of courage is used because of the incorrect recognition of the facts. The impact of this is that the business fails in private undertakings, which is only the loss of the shareholders. Mr. Arnold is a big businessman, and he should know this kind of experience. Public undertakings make the political expenses huge, which is for the entire public. Mr. Arnold may be so focused on business that he does not have time to study politics. If he measures it with common sense, he should also know it. According to reports, the financial director said at the meeting of the Finance Committee that the rent has fallen by 70%. Is this the result of the prosperity of the social economy, or the result of the decline? Otherwise, is the director's statement untrue? Mr. Arnold said that the rent is ten yuan, and the monthly increase in donations is only two corners, as if it is not a big deal. Compared with the business loss, which is as high as 700,000 or 800,000 pounds, it is really indifferent. However, there are still people in the world who are very concerned about every penny. Mr. Arnold should have heard of it. Mr. Pei has returned to the mountains, and the public still has the song of Gantang. How much goodwill has Mr. Arnold gained from the public? Is it estimated? Increasing the public burden is a major accident. The proposition of seven to six, extending it for a week, and considering it for a long time, but Mr. Arnold is brave enough to use the weapon of two votes by one person to dismiss the consideration of exercising reason. The establishment of the resolution of increasing donations is due to the courage of Mr. Arnold. Now that the big mistake has not become an iron case, please Mr. Arnold carefully examine the truth of the social economy, review the political books, use the courage to maintain the music team's remittance subsidy, reduce the number of public rickshaws, support public buses, and seal off the Yu Yucun, and release the bells attached to it to make up for the previous faults. I hope to see a reply. Sincerely yours, Mr. Arnold, Director General of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession."

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent an Urgent Telegram to the Government Requesting that the Import Tax on Foreign Rice Not Be Waived

Representatives Gu Xinyi and Others Have Gone to Nanjing to Petition; Please Take Into Account National Interests and People's Livelihoods and Adopt It

Gu Xinyi and other representatives of the bean and rice industry, miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, miscellaneous grain store industry, and Jiangsu Ning Shanghai county rice industry association in this city petitioned that the exemption of foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province would harm national interests and people's livelihoods. Special representatives Gu Xinyi and others went to Nanjing last night and petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance today. This morning, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent an urgent telegram to the Yuan and the Ministry, requesting that it be adopted. The details of each telegram are recorded below:

Urgent Telegram from the Chamber of Commerce: To the Nanjing Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, the exemption of tax on foreign rice and foreign grains for transportation to Guangdong will increase the national leakage and put the national rice in a desperate situation. Gu Xinyi and other representatives of the Shanghai miscellaneous grain and bean rice industry jointly petitioned with representatives from various places today. We respectfully ask you to take into account the national interests and people's livelihoods and adopt it. We are eagerly looking forward to it. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Koushi,

Rice Industry Association: The Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, the Miscellaneous Grain Store Industry Association, and the Jiangsu Ning Shanghai County Rice Industry Association Joint Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying, "Dear Sir, the import tax on foreign rice in Guangdong Province should not be exempted in terms of the integrity of customs duties, and it cannot be exempted in terms of the national economy. Even in terms of the people's food in Guangdong Province, it is not necessary to be exempted. The reasons for this have been seen in the articles and telegrams of various groups published in the newspapers. We will not repeat them here. Who would have thought that the foreign rice tax, which should not be exempted, cannot be exempted, and is not necessary to be exempted, Guangdong Province actually has a saying that it will exempt the tax on imported foreign rice and foreign grains from April 1st by 2 million dan. If it is seen in fact, its impact on national interests and people's livelihoods will be extremely serious. It is no wonder that the people are shocked, the customs are suspicious, and the voices of opposition are all over the provinces. Now, food groups in various provinces and cities have sent representatives to Nanjing and are scheduled to jointly petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on the 30th of this month, requesting that the exemption be cancelled. We cannot bear to remain silent, and in addition to sending representatives to Nanjing to participate in the petition, we specially ask your association to quickly send a telegram to the Yuan and the Ministry to approve the adoption of this petition, and we will not be able to pray for it."

Telegram from Changsha: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, yesterday received a telegram from Guangdong, stating that the province has clearly approved the tax-free import of 2 million shi of foreign grains, etc. This matter is very important for the domestic rice sales market in the Yangtze River Basin. In addition to sending details separately, we hope to strive for it together to maintain the national economy. The United Office of Export Rice Merchants in Changsha Kou You,

Lunhui Ganzhang: The Nanjing Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, the Guangdong provincial food administration, have repeatedly followed the province's request to put the import of foreign rice and foreign grains on a half-tax account, relax the quota limit, and limit it to 1 million dan, and order the domestic rice-producing provinces to dredge up transportation and sales, allocate special vehicles, and continuously transport them. According to the inspection member sent by the Ministry to inspect the people's food in the province, the situation has improved, and it is reported that the surplus rice that can be exported in Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces is about 20 million dan, and the rice and grain shortage in Shandong Province is only 4 or 5 million dan by the end of the year, which is more than enough to make up for the shortfall. But at this time, there is another request for 2 million dan of foreign rice and foreign grains to be put on a half-tax account again. In this situation, it will not only increase the national leakage, but also put the domestic rice in a desperate situation. Guangdong Province has always taken the overall situation into consideration, and it does not seem that it should follow the habit of eating foreign rice for many years and put the national interests and people's livelihoods behind the plan. It is reasonable to send a telegram to the Yuan (Ministry) to review and approve it, and not to follow the request, so as to maintain domestic agricultural production. We are eager to wait for orders. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Kougan,

### Silk Weaving Workers Went on Strike Last Night

Party and Government Organs Failed to Mediate This Morning

According to Dagong News Agency, the workers of all silk weaving factories in the city demanded to improve the treatment conditions. Other parts have been decided after mediation, but the opinions of labor and capital on the wage issue are different and have not been resolved. The party and government organs of the city convened both parties to hold the third mediation from 9:00 am yesterday. Cai Shengbai, Yuan Weichen, and Jin Deqing of the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Industry Association, Pan Yuncai of District 1, Zhu Yousheng of District 3, He Yao of District 4, Wu Ying of District 7, and others, as well as Wang Jisong, the representative of the American Asian Factory, Lu Yinchu and Li Weixiong, the representatives of the Municipal Party Department, Xu Yefu, Zhu Guilin, and Zhang Chuqiang of the Social Bureau, etc. attended. Xu Yefu chaired the meeting and Jiang Shifu recorded the meeting. After the chairman read out the second mediation decision, the mediation began. The wage part (including the wage level of weavers, warp and weft workers, apprentices, and pedaling workers), but the labor side insisted on a 20% increase across the board, and the capital side opposed taking the Pu Jia method because the situation of each factory was different and the capital was not uniform. Although the representatives of the party and government organs held individual talks separately, there was still no result. The mediation was declared unsuccessful and adjourned at 5:00 pm.

After the Social Bureau's mediation failed, the labor representatives immediately announced that they would not be responsible in the future, and then went back to report the mediation situation to the city's silk weaving workers, requesting to improve the treatment committee, and held an emergency standing committee, which decided on many important cases before adjourning. The representatives of each district reported back to each district, and the workers in each district automatically went on strike because the mediation had no results. Before 9:30 pm last night, the strikers included Yuhou, Jinji, Xiefeng, Yumin, Yinli, Jinhua, Yuanyuan, Rongzhang, Tianfu, Jindong, Tianxing, Hengyi, Huatong, Xinsheng, Xinfeng, Jinxin, Yifeng, Yiyou, Damei, Puyi, Meiwen, Tiancheng, China, Wanlong, Yuanyuan, Gexin, Linji, Hongchang, Hexing, Jinsheng, Zhicheng, Hengxiang, Xieji, Xielong, Xinhua Zhouji, Dexing, Yongli, Zhicheng, Jiulong, Xieda, Jiufeng, Huiqing, Yunlin, Xiesheng, Jingwei, and 9 factories in the American Asian Factory in the East Shanghai District, the American Asian General Factory, the American Asian 7th Factory, the American Asian 5th Factory, Shengdan, Huacheng, Wufeng, Yuanyuan, Yuanyou, Yili, Yuanxinfeng, Weichang, Yong'an, Qinyu, Tongyuan, Tongfeng, Jiren, Chongqing, Tianyuan, Guangming, Zhongyu, and Sanyi in the South Shanghai District, and the American Asian 10th Factory, the American Asian 2nd Factory, Rongcheng, Juchang, Shengsheng, Yonghua, Xingmin, Weixin, Shixin, and other more than 130 factories in the North Shanghai District. The workers will hold an emergency representative meeting at 7:00 this morning. After hearing the news, the party and government authorities are planning to eliminate and reconcile the situation.

### The New Yu Spinning Mill Labor Dispute Remains Unresolved

The Ministry of Industries Sends Telegram to Shanghai to Inquire About the Truth; Party and Government Order the Factory to Resume Operations

The labor dispute at the First and Second Factories of the New Yu Spinning Mill has yet to be resolved. The Ministry of Industries yesterday telegraphed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the truth of the labor dispute. Yesterday morning, workers sent representatives to the Party and Government to petition. In addition to ordering the factory to resume operations, the Social Affairs Bureau has also scheduled a mediation meeting for April 1st. The details are as follows:

Ministry of Industries Investigation: Since the outbreak of the New Yu labor dispute, no resolution has been reached due to the persistent stances of both parties. In order to maintain industry and promote cooperation between labor and management, the Ministry of Industries specifically telegraphed the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to inquire about the situation and how it is being handled. After receiving the telegram from the Ministry of Industries, the Bureau replied yesterday, stating that the Bureau had instructed the factory to resume operations and ordered the workers to return to work. As for the dismissal of workers, the dispute will be mediated according to the law.

Petition to the Party and Government: The entire workforce of the Second Factory of the New Yu Spinning Mill, located on Robison Road in West Shanghai, sent eight representatives, including Xu Peijin, to the Party and Government offices yesterday morning to petition. Lu Yinchu, a cadre from the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Committee, Xu Yefu, the head of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Long Yuting, an executive committee member of the General Labor Union, received them. The workers' representatives first explained the reasons for the difficulty in resuming work and the strict precautions taken by the factory, requesting assistance from the authorities. The Party and Government representatives advised the workers to resume work first and await mediation regarding the dismissed workers. The representatives left at 11:30 AM.

Order to Resume Operations: Since the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau issued an order for the workers to resume work by a specific date, the workers have been slow to return to the factory due to various difficulties. At the same time, the factory has not announced any plans to resume operations. The authorities believe that the prolonged dispute is detrimental to the welfare of both parties. Therefore, the Party and Government jointly ordered the First and Second Factories to resume operations immediately to allow the workers to return to work.

Scheduled Mediation: As for the 56 dismissed workers, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered a temporary suspension of their return to work. Therefore, the dispute is scheduled for further mediation between labor and management at 10:00 AM on April 1st in accordance with the law, in order to resolve the labor dispute as soon as possible. It is also reported that the factory will issue wages today. All workers have decided to refuse to receive them because the dispute has not been resolved.

Issuing Wages: The spinning mill authorities posted a notice at the factory gate last night stating: "This factory will issue the first half of March wages for the Second Factory from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM tomorrow, and the first half of March wages for the First Factory from 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Unless there are special circumstances, all workers are requested to bring their work booklets to receive the wages." According to the above situation, it is feared that it will be difficult to resume factory operations for a while.

### Important Recommendations in the Shanghai Municipal Council Housing Committee Report

Reduce Rents and Improve Sanitation; Divided into Six Sections and Listed in a Chart

According to the "North-China Daily News," the Shanghai Municipal Council Housing Committee has been working for many months and has drafted a report for submission to the Municipal Council. The report lists several important recommendations and is specially published in the "Indian Municipal Gazette" on Monday.

The Municipal Council has not yet studied the report and will leave it to the new Board of Directors to consider. One of the most important recommendations is that the Municipal Council should appoint a permanent officer or committee to continue studying ways to ease the situation. From an economic perspective, there are two ways to consider this: one is to reduce rents, and the other is to improve sanitation. The first method includes: ㊀ public subsidies for housing construction; ㊁ reducing the assessed value of cheap housing properties; ㊂ allowing the construction of more multi-story buildings that are not too tall; ㊃ cooperating with the industrial sector to build workers' housing; ㊄ improving cheap transportation; ㊅ cooperating with authorities outside the concession to build houses; ㊆ increasing wages; ㊇ cheap dormitories for single men and women; ㊈ reducing lending rates; ㊉ reducing mortgage rates. The second method includes: ㊀ increasing sanitary facilities; ㊁ rejecting excessive occupants; ㊂ widening roads and alleys, increasing the construction of parks, and planting more trees to improve air circulation; ㊃ reducing coal smoke in the sky; ㊄ cleaning waterways or setting up water pipes; disposal of commercial waste is also included; ㊅ cheaper public water supply; ㊆ separating warehouses and factories to prevent them from concentrating in one place; ㊇ demolishing unsuitable buildings; ㊈ providing family planning education; ㊉ not encouraging excessive immigration into the concession. The report also suggests that the Municipal Council Public Works Department should

Encourage the construction of a standardized style of housing for the establishment of small-scale factories, with workers' dormitories, in order to gradually replace the current unsuitable改造的factory buildings. In the future, no residential building may be used for industrial purposes without obtaining a permit. The regulations in the permit must ensure the safety and hygiene of the workers, and toilets should also be made available. Other important recommendations are as follows: After the committee reviewed the designs of Chinese-style houses proposed by the Public Works Department that would be convenient to build in the future, it advocated that the Municipal Council should approve the

Construction principles contained in this design and advocate that the Municipal Council should encourage and assist in the construction of this type or similar houses, and formulate trial rules for this construction. However, it does not advocate the exclusive use of a fixed design, because it believes that architects should be allowed to make improved designs

Chinese houses within a wide range of possible concessions. All designs for new-style houses should be placed in the Public Works Department for public reference. The trial rules for new buildings should limit the height of rooms in Chinese-style houses to eight feet (Mr. Fraser dissented and advocated eight feet six inches). Furthermore, it is difficult to prevent the courtyard space, which was previously used to provide necessary air space for residents of Chinese-style houses, from being misused. Therefore, the committee advocated that the new trial rules for house construction should not allow courtyards to be used as space, and that space should be provided in the walkways thereafter. The width of the walkways should not be less than five feet. All top floors of buildings used for industrial purposes must be demolished. In the future, no more top floors will be allowed to be built. The report is divided into six sections, along with attached charts, more than thirty pages long, and includes a chart showing the population density per acre in the International Settlement.

### Second Special District Municipalities Jointly Issue Declaration Opposing Increased Donations in the International Settlement

According to the "National Society," the Municipal Citizens' Federation of the Second Special District of this city held its 13th Organizing Committee meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved to issue a declaration on the increase in the Municipal General Donation in the International Settlement. The details are as follows:

Organizing Committee Meeting: The association held its 13th Organizing Committee meeting yesterday. More than ten people including Huang Xianggu, Wang Deyan, Li Weiliang, Wang Haifan, Dong Kechang, Qu Zhenhua, Bei Zairong, Zhou Lingfu, Long Jingyan, Zhang Shishi, Mao Yun, He Erming, and Zheng Ziliang attended. Qu Zhenhua was elected chairman. After the formalities, the progress of the association's affairs was reported, and then the discussion began: ㊀ The association's charter has been drafted and is submitted for review (resolved) and submitted to the Municipal Party Department for review. ㊁ The Board of Directors of the International Settlement Municipal Council, regardless of the economic difficulties of the citizens, brazenly passed the method of increasing the Municipal General Donation. How should the association express its opinion? The resolution was to issue a declaration and send letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement, and the Municipal Citizens' Federation of the First Special District to strive for cancellation. ㊂ A letter from the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association stated that the French Concession authorities have recently severely cracked down on the sale of proprietary medicines by non-pharmacies. All foreign grocery stores selling proprietary medicines have been banned. This matter has greatly affected the safety of patients and the business of pharmaceutical merchants. Please preside over justice and forward a letter to the主管authorities of the French Concession to immediately stop the crackdown to benefit hygiene. The resolution was to forward a letter to the French Concession Public Works Bureau. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.

Issuing a Declaration: The Municipal Citizens' Federation of the Second Special District issued the following declaration on the issue of the increase in the Municipal General Donation by the International Settlement Municipal Council: "This time, the International Settlement Municipal Council, regardless of everything, brazenly passed the case of increasing the Municipal General Donation at the Board of Directors meeting. When the news came, the public was panicked. The reason why the Municipal Council wants to increase donations is entirely because the income and expenditure cannot be offset. To solve the financial difficulties, we must start from the root and eliminate waste and save expenses. This is a good way. However, the Bureau does not do this, but wants to use the increase in donations to資挹注, abandoning the root and pursuing the end, only increasing the suffering of the citizens without helping the actual finances. Moreover, in recent years, commerce has been declining, and the suffering suffered by the citizens is difficult to describe. Now, in order to solve the financial difficulties, the Municipal Council directly treats the merchants and people who are苟延殘喘 as a move to敲骨吸髓. In this situation, it is tantamount to deliberately摧殘 the merchants and people. Even if it is a dying tree, there is still no time to cultivate and maintain it, but to exploit it will inevitably lead to death. Alas, my citizens, how are we different from this? Although this association is not in the same area, it shares the same fate as the market. Therefore, we believe that the move by the International Settlement Municipal Council to increase the Municipal General Donation is inappropriate. We only hope that the authorities will综聚 the advantages and disadvantages and make a decisive decision to submit this case for reconsideration and cancellation, so that commerce can prosper and the market can be revived."

Please Order He Kangli to Compensate Damages of More Than 20,000 Gold; Seek Justice from the Judge Based on Legal Basis and Human Sympathy

Luo Xi, a girl from Changsha, also known as Wei Xuezhen, 17 years old this year, was forcibly raped by He Kangli, a fellow villager from Huarong, on October 19 last year. She reported to the French Concession Police Station and filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court, which sentenced He to six months in prison and a three-year reprieve on the 10th of this month. During the appeal period, the defendant was transferred to a detention center. During the criminal trial, the victim filed an incidental civil lawsuit for damages of 20,200 yuan, and the judgment was transferred to the Civil Court for trial. After the criminal verdict, Luo Xi personally wrote a complaint in vernacular and submitted it to the Civil Court of the Second Special Court. Her

Original Complaint Reads: "Wise Judge, I believe that national law is a weapon to punish cunning villains, so the only way for those who抱不平 is to resort to law. I am a weak woman who is零丁孤苦 and suffers重重 oppression. I could not bear the abuse of my foster father and fled to Shanghai to live independently. I was蹂躪by He Kangli, a beast in human form. Because of the exposure of this tragedy, I was冷諷熱嘲 by feudal society, especially this hymen

Still being valued now, my entire future and lifelong happiness have been ruined and I am in a desperate situation. This kind of mental pain is really hard for a sensitive animal to bear. Moreover, I have no artistic talent and my education level is extremely幼稚. I have no way to help myself. Since the ugly thing has been publicized, those who can help me have撒手不顧. Not only is my lifelong life a big problem, but even my current clothing and food are still nowhere to be found. At the hearing on March 6,

The sympathetic audience gave me a few dollars, which were used up long ago. Recently, the Court sent a subpoena. The travel expenses of three 角 five 分 were borrowed from a fellow villager. Because my mind was过受stimulate,禍不單行 and I became seriously ill. The medical expenses were also borrowed东扯西挪. These are all my current difficult situation. These indescribable pains are all given by the道敗類 He Kangli. Wise Judge, this is

What an unfortunate thing. According to the law, "Those who unlawfully infringe upon the rights of others shall be liable for damages." "Those who unlawfully害侵害 the body, health, reputation, or freedom of others, even if the damage is not on property, may also request a price equivalent to the amount." Therefore, I beg the judge, based on the law and with human sympathy, to order the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for living expenses of 40 yuan per month (480 yuan per year), calculated for 40 years, totaling 19,200 yuan, plus a consolation fee of 1,000 yuan, totaling

20,200 yuan. He Kangli is the number one土豪劣绅 in Huarong County, Hunan. He has always used money and power to oppress and引誘 women. I am just one of the people he oppressed and引誘. (After I was 강간 by him, I asked him to marry me formally. He replied to me, "If I play with a woman, I have to get married once, then I don't know how many wives I have." See the criminal court's testimony. I have always believed that

The dignified national law, the wise and upright judge, will give this kind of敗類 appropriate punishment." The case was heard by Judge Li Liang of the Civil Court of the Second Special Court in the seventh court yesterday morning. The plaintiff and her lawyer were present.

Compensate for living expenses and a consolation fee of a total of 10,200 yuan. Asked, why do you want so much? Answer, in Shanghai, 40 yuan a month for one person is not too much. Asked, does the defendant have the ability to compensate? Answer, he said he is a gentleman from Huarong, Hunan, and he can afford to compensate. He Kangli, the defendant, testified that he was 27 years old, from Hunan, and used to study at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. He graduated two years ago. Because of family difficulties, he stopped studying. Through a friend's introduction, he became a teacher at Guangxia Middle School with a monthly salary of eight yuan. When I met the plaintiff, I lived in a

Small亭子間 and she also knew about my difficult living conditions. Now she wants me to compensate more than 20,000 yuan. Where do I have this much power? Even if I have the power, I am not willing to compensate her even a penny, because the criminal case has already been appealed, and she has another情入 Liu Binru who will support her. At this point, the court believed that the case was clear, ordered the opening of the辩谕, announced the end, and set the judgment to be announced on April 3. The defendant was still remanded to the detention center because the judgment in the criminal case was not yet determined. Although he submitted a statement requesting交未 未裁定核准.

### Zheng Guanghe Company to Move to New Building Today

The Zheng Guanghe Company, located at No. 44 Fuzhou Road, has been there for 42 years. The original site was renovated at the beginning of January this year, and the new building was completed day and night. It is called the McLeish Building and is in the Elizabethan style, similar to an ancient Elizabethan旅邸 with a large courtyard and a triangular gabled oak-paneled hall, which can be used as a conference room or reception room.

### Gliding Machine to Be Transported to Shanghai for Repair

To Be Re-Flown After Repair in Longhua

Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, advocated the organization of the Piao Xiang Sports Association by promoting air sports with people from all walks of life in the country. Two Piao Xiang machines were specially commissioned by German mechanic Hao Yixin. The machines are monoplanes, each about two丈 long and five or six feet wide, made entirely of thin panels, without engines. Relying on wind power, they can飄翔 in the air. After the machines were completed, Hao Yixin took one of them to Qizi Mountain near Suzhou for a test flight a few days ago. The mountain is only 500 feet high, so the test flight results were not good. Both flights only lasted more than a minute before landing.

### A Tragic Tale of a Girl in Human Hell

Sun Xiaohong Attempted Suicide by Drowning, Prevented by Police; Gu Fengbao, with Malicious Intent, Forced Her into Prostitution

At 5:20 AM on the 28th of this month, Sun Xiaohong, a 17-year-old girl from Liyang, was found weeping along the North Suzhou River on North Xizang Road, attempting to drown herself. She was spotted by Chinese Constable No. 550, who stopped her and took her to the Huishi Police Station. Upon questioning, the girl stated that in May of the year before last, she had been lured to Shanghai by her stepfather, Fang Deqing, who then took her to Gu Fengbao, a Yangzhou woman who ran a brothel at No. 111 Baker Road, and sold her to Gu for 200 yuan. From then on, Gu taught

Sun to dance and sent her to work as a dancer at the Yuegong and Shunfeng dance halls on North Sichuan Road. However, because her career was not going well and her income was meager, Gu forced her to engage in prostitution in January of last year. She lost her virginity to a Mr. Zhang at the Zhongzhou Hotel on Shandong Road. From then on, Gu would send an old woman or a maid named Su Ying to accompany her to various hotels every night to solicit customers, causing her immense suffering. She often thought of escaping this sea of misery but never had the chance. On the night of the 27th of this month, Sun was again called upon to accompany a certain Mr. X, a traveler staying at the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, so Gu ordered Su Ying

to accompany her. Upon arriving at the hotel, Sun excused herself to use the restroom and took the opportunity to escape. She walked to the North Xizang Road Bridge and, thinking that this kind of life was no different from hell, decided to die. Just as she was about to jump into the river, she was stopped by the police. She also stated that Gu Fengbao currently resided at No. 690, Lane 130, Xiamen Road. The police station believed that this case should be handled by the Lao Zha Police Station, so they immediately sent her there. Chinese Detective Qiu Sijiu went and arrested Gu Fengbao, and Su Ying (currently 15 years old) was also present. They were both taken to the police station. It was discovered that Su Ying had also been

bought by Gu. Furthermore, the girl had been raped by Gu's husband when she was 13 years old. The police decided to send Sun and Su Ying to the Jiliang Institute for temporary shelter, while Gu was detained. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court, where Judge Qian Hongye interrogated her. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the situation and charged her under Article 241, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, stating that the police station had found many deeds of sale in the defendant Gu Fengbao's home, indicating that she was in the business of forcing women into prostitution. Therefore, further investigation was needed, and the court was asked to postpone the hearing. The defendant's lawyer, She Yan Li Zhongwen, argued, and Judge Qian, after reviewing the case, decided to postpone the hearing.

The writer paid a special visit yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM. Ms. Gao was packing and graciously agreed to an interview, the outline of which is recorded below. Implementing the ten methods of advance petition is really not an easy task. The first step now is to publicize. The Central Propaganda Department and the Central Photography Studio have already sent people to accompany us along the way. Furthermore, the central government will establish border area party affairs to first carry out publicity work, promote it, and then seek to develop all the rich resources, striving to achieve the three main points of education, upbringing, and healthcare. Although the result of this petition was very good, how to do it is the responsibility of the local government and everyone to cooperate. Furthermore, when we go back, we will visit various places. She said that the people's autonomous factory in Wuxi has the best method and is easy to implement. I will immediately go back and do the same. Therefore, other places must also be visited. During this period in Shanghai, it will be no more than two weeks at most, because Chairman He Jian of the Hunan government has already made several appointments, and it is decided to visit Hunan. There are many Yi and Miao people there, so it is good to meet and discuss development methods. Recently, universities have invited lectures. I am now thinking of reporting the situation of my Yi and Miao people to various universities, and also to investigate the factories and schools in Shanghai.

Paper money other than that of the Central, China, and Communications Banks in Shanghai has been gradually withdrawn. The credit coupons issued by merchants in various counties of Fujian have also been strictly banned by the provincial government and have been cleared up. The original subsidiary currencies of the three banks circulating in the market have suddenly decreased, while the five-corner, one-corner, and one-corner subsidiary currencies issued by the Fujian Provincial Bank are prevalent among the people. The use of these subsidiary currencies is mostly issued by various agencies affiliated with the provincial government.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,

Our bureau held a public auction of inland waterway vessels on the 22nd of this month. The winning bidders were Li Junqing, Lin Xijin, and Zhang Jinshi. The vessels won were the Xin Wanli, Gongji, and Yuanji, three in total, and the transfer of ownership is currently being processed. However, there are still many vessels that were not successfully bid for. We are continuing to advertise for tenders, and another public auction is scheduled for the 15th of next month. However, in today's news in your newspaper, there is a section entitled ‘First Tender for Inland Merchant Ships Invalid’. This does not correspond to the facts mentioned above. All three tenderers were successful in their bids. We are therefore writing to your newspaper to request that you investigate and correct the record accordingly. Sincerely, The Shipping Department of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, March 30th.

Dear Editor,

Recently, we have received letters from many sources informing us that an organization using the name "Chinese Government International Relief Socic" is soliciting donations in this city, claiming that its headquarters is located in the Qingdao city area of Shandong Province. Because its name is similar to ours, many suspect that it is a branch of our association and have inquired about the matter. Lately, social morals are not what they used to be, and unscrupulous individuals often create sham charitable organizations to collect money for their own gain. We therefore consulted the Qingdao Municipal Government to inquire whether such an organization exists within its jurisdiction and whether it has sent personnel to solicit donations outside the area. We have now received a reply stating that there is no such organization in the city. It is clear that unscrupulous bandits are engaging in fraud for profit. We are deeply concerned that the public, unaware of the true situation, will be deceived. We are therefore writing to you to request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section so that the public will be aware. Sincerely, The China International Famine Relief Commission, March 30th, 1937.

### Weather Report

The Xu Jia Hui Observatory's weather forecast for 4:30 PM yesterday states that the area around Shandong is clear, with southwest to northwest winds and smog. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River are overcast, with rain or fog and a gentle cyclone due to low pressure passing through Jiangxi. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River have northeast to northwest winds. The East China Sea and northern Taiwan are overcast, with rain or fog and strong northeast to southeast winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 59.9 degrees, and the lowest was 45.7 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 56.5 degrees, and the lowest was 39.7 degrees.

Spring and Autumn

### Need

— (Wang Jihua)

The reason for "need" lies in lack: the affluent do not "need".

The prerequisite for "need" lies in envy.

"Need" is the starting point in the history of human evolution.

Before "need" there must be thought, at this time there must be twelve points of enthusiasm.

The aftermath of "need" is pursuit, at that time the heart must be filled with infinite hope.

To realize the future purpose of "need", there must be abundant patience.

Near the end of "need", there must be an unspeakable anxiety in the heart.

The final end of "need" is either disappointment or triumph.

"Need" is not desire, unreasonable, inappropriate.

Excessive "need" is greed and insatiability.

### Talking About Marked-Down Green Pillows

— Pillow Green

“49 cents,” “95 cents,” “$1.98,” “$2.88,” “$4.95,”…

Walking into a department store, looking at the price tags in front of the colorful goods, each one wears an unwavering face with a fixed price. You can't help but feel that the price marked above is more like the amount of a fine or the years of imprisonment under a legal judgment. This is even more conclusive, with no room for protest or appeal.

The numbers on those price tags are so strangely odd, each showing off its different posture, vying for customers' attention. Customers, accustomed to daily contact, are at ease and not surprised, thinking in their floating minds that they are indeed the accurate and appropriate numbers they should take. But if you think about it a little, you will definitely find that most of the odd-numbered price tags are not only accidental, but also subtly grasp the customer's psychology!

Temporarily putting aside the method of intentionally reducing the price by one or two cents, avoiding taxes, and pleasing customers, discarding national obligations for the sake of immediate business interests. In any case, the odd and incomplete numbers can easily make customers' memory fall into a state of confusion. What they remember and can say is often "less than a few yuan" or "a few yuan and change". But taking "$2.88" as an example, this price is not much shorter than the clumsy whole price of "$3", but in people's general concept, it can occupy a lot more winning labor because of this.

Looking at the few price tags mentioned at the beginning, most of them are enough to suggest that there is a higher original price to be calculated by inference, and the current price is the result of a discount, which shows that it is truly cheap.

If you choose that item priced at $2.88, and you happen to have $3 in legal tender in your pocket, enough for the transaction, then you pay according to the price, and you can still get 12 cents in change. This small amount of 'return to the warehouse' does not let you shrink back empty-handed, enough for your transportation home or the price of a pack of cigarettes, isn't it also a way to comfort you that is better than nothing?

The role of such pricing also contains the meaning of life. By extension, enlightening it, it can be said to be all-pervasive and suitable for all applications. For example, even the dignity of the law must allow a person who is being searched or declared bankrupt to retain the tools for his personal life. Even the humblest of young children often kindly return a few coins to a person who has been robbed of everything, so as not to make him walk home barefoot in the cold of the night. Cunning officials seize land only up to eight or nine tenths, still leaving some for the common people to stand on. People in Jiangxi always leave a few grains of rice in the bottom of their bowls when eating. The world is generally like this, this is called "leaving a hand" for others, sharing the thought of "having surplus and not exhausting".

Thoughts turn to fantasy: If our country's diplomacy could adopt this kind of "pricing method", would it be helpful? Come up with a "pricing diplomacy", what is so-called "water bird diplomacy", what kind of diplomacy, etc., why bother to mention it?

### Bird's-Eye View of the Huai River Diversion Project Section — Tu Hongxia

— Tu Hongxia

To fulfill my long-cherished desire to visit the Huai River diversion project section, on a sunny and breezy day full of spring, I rushed to my destination with two close friends.

In the past, this road was desolate, but now, because of the Huai River diversion project, it is much more lively. In addition to the trees that have not yet turned green, there are also many pedestrians coming and going.

The Huai River diversion is the most recent and greatest project. After more than two years of time and the efforts of hundreds of thousands of workers, the initial phase of the project to divert the river into the sea has not yet been completed. It is said that there are only two months left until the final deadline. The provincial government and the authorities in charge of the Huai River diversion are preparing to release water on May 1st of this year. We believe that this project is indeed related to the water conservancy and agriculture of the entire northern Jiangsu Province. Although it is currently consuming a lot of manpower and financial resources, its future success will bring unlimited benefits.

The organization of the workers is completely militarized, with team leaders, platoon leaders, and company leaders leading the workers to work in an orderly manner. In addition to their work, the remaining time is spent sitting around in reed mats like military tents, chatting, telling stories, and telling jokes to relieve the fatigue of work.

The authorities, in addition to trying their best to make their lives fulfilling, also sometimes gather them to give speeches on the spirit of cooperation. In terms of entertainment, there are also music, movies, and other organizations, so the workers feel very comfortable.

Each worker can earn between one and two jiao of wages per day. In addition to the cost of firewood, rice, and noodles necessary for living, they can still save three to five cents, because many of them live very frugally, mixing coarse grains with rice for cooking, and most of the side dishes are dried radishes and raw salt. This spirit of seeking benefits for the majority and willingly being frugal themselves is truly admirable.

In order to protect the safety of the workers, the authorities have specially dispatched troops and security teams from various counties to take charge, stationed in various places. There are always hundreds of people stationed every mile. At the same time, many clinics have been established, and medicines are supplied by the clinics. The sanitation of the project section is also well-equipped.

Goods arriving at the project section are much more expensive because of the transportation costs along the way and the merchants' greed, but all the necessities of life are available.

There are almost only men on the project section, with very few women. "Journey to the West" has a country of women, and this place has the flavor of a country of men.

The county magistrates of the counties along the river and the district chiefs of each district are almost always supervising the project section. The progress of the project is certainly the crystallization of the workers' blood and sweat, but it is also due to their effective command!

On the way back, I silently prayed for the happiness of these many hardworking workers!

### Records of Human Suffering (3)

— Zhou Shoujuan

I usually handled matters on my desk, which was in the children's bedroom: we always had one lamp on together at night, and laughter and the sound of reading echoed each other. My desk was often piled with books, manuscripts, and newspapers like fallen leaves in autumn, and Rong'er always organized them for me. Now, the stack of newspapers and several stacks of miscellaneous books on the windowsill of my desk are the last ones Rong'er organized, and I seem to still see the traces of her hands. Alas, from now on, how can I bear to examine and read them again! Every time I returned from Shanghai, my suitcase was full of manuscripts and letters, which were always unsealed and sorted by my eldest son, Zheng, divided into several categories, and then placed on my desk, waiting for me to select and edit them. If my eldest son was busy with his studies, Rong'er would do it for him. Her work was as orderly as her brother's. Sometimes, seeing something that caught her eye, she would also write articles on children's knowledge and secretly insert them among the other manuscripts to submit. When I selected and read them, I was secretly delighted. I would choose the best ones and publish them in the 'Children's Supplement' to encourage her to improve. The other day, I examined her belongings and actually found two manuscripts in a book, one called 'Clam' and the other 'Sea Urchin', one marked for use in April and the other for use in May, apparently written in advance during her holidays. Alas, Rong'er, how could you know that you would leave this world before the day was out and could not even last until April or May! What is even more painful is that all the manuscripts she had recently written were about aquatic creatures, and she ended up falling into the water and dying, joining the aquatic creatures: every time I think of this, tears fall lightly.

My eldest son and I loved flowers as if they were our lives, and Rong also loved them: whenever it was time to plant flowers and trees, she would always help us. Last winter, I obtained an ancient plum tree stump from the mountains. Half of the massive trunk was hollow, and it was probably several hundred years old. I brought it back and planted it in a giant pot, reclining it in the shape of a hanging cliff. Rong then chose the branches and trunks that had not withered and carefully carved them one by one, making them look like dry trunks, full of artistic intent. I was overjoyed and praised her warmly, and then had her carve all the other small plum tree stumps, all of which were successfully completed. One day, Rong saw me planting pines, bamboos, and plums in broken pottery jars, and she imitated me, finding half of a broken flowerpot, carving it into the shape of a boat, and transplanting three clumps of violets onto it, adding a piece of stone for support. It was naturally picturesque. I was even more delighted and kept it in the greenhouse, watering it frequently. The other day, I painfully took it out to look at it, and the leaves were all fresh green, and the buds were about to bloom. I immediately placed it on the porch and asked my family to take care of it, so that it would be a permanent memento. How could I have known that when I looked at it the next morning, one clump in the middle had withered: could it be that the flowers also had knowledge and were making this painful expression? In the summer, the gardeners were busy cultivating chrysanthemums and had no time to take care of other things; Rong would wear a broken straw hat and old leather shoes every evening and go with her brother to draw water from the pond and carry it to water the garden, often with sweat on her body and her trousers wet with water, and she was content. Alas, Rong'er, who would have known that the pond from which you used to draw water to irrigate the garden would be the place where you died today! In the past, Jingwei carried stones to fill the sea of hatred; this pond is also my sea of hatred: I will wait until the period of mourning for my child has passed, and her soul returns, and I will hire workers to transport mud and fill this evil pond, to atone for my child.

Rong'er was strong from a young age and never suffered from any illnesses. She was bold and could endure pain: if a fleshy growth appeared under her chin, she would pluck it out, blood would gush out, but she would not care. One day, she was racing with her classmates at school and lost her footing and fell to the ground, and the skin on both her knees was broken like the size of a palm, with coal dust embedded in the flesh. Rong then removed it herself, applying iodine. The pain was excruciating, but she endured it silently, fearing that her mother would find out. Later, her mother saw it by chance and comforted her for her pain, but Rong only smiled it off. I then said to Fengjun: This child is bold and ruthless, and could become a surgeon in the future to save the world and help people. How could I have known that she would die prematurely and abandon her loving parents!

### Reincarnated Phoenix

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter 12: White Tablet and Red Paper Vainly Return Two Lines of Tears, Reed Flowers and Maple Leaves Alone Walk Half a City of Autumn

Guoqi could tell that he was forcing a smile when he arrived. Now that he was saying goodbye, he had the same forced composure, so he didn't try to persuade him to stay. He walked with his head down towards the alleyway, and kept walking until he reached the entrance, then he turned back to look. He didn't seem to expect that Guoqi would still be standing at the gate. At first, he was shocked, but then he stopped, smiled, and nodded, saying, "Please go back." He figured that Guoqi would still be standing at the gate, so he didn't turn back again. After that one turn, he seemed to have a strong feeling. Between people, there is always that "fate" that Buddhists talk about. With fate, things go well, whether it's making friends, or even marriage between a man and a woman. Without fate, no matter how close people are, they can't succeed in anything. Guoqi hadn't even had a conversation with Menglan, and yet they had become the kind of friends who would live and die for each other. From this point of view, you can't force anything. There's a reason for this. It's also a case of getting twice the result with half the effort to help those who are destined for each other. He and Menglan had such a good friendship, so he would try to put in a little more effort for them. Thinking like this, he felt like he had a load off his mind. He decided that he would meet Menglan at school the next day and go to his house together. With this in mind, he deliberately went to school earlier the next day, hoping to have a contact with Menglan before class. But he didn't come in the morning, and he still didn't come in the afternoon. After school, Youmei simply grabbed his bag and headed to the Jiang's house. As soon as he entered, he met Xiaoju, who said, "Miss Li, you've come at the right time. Our lady is sick again." Youmei said, "Sick again? Why?" Xiaoju smiled and said, "Being sick is just being sick, why does there have to be a reason?" Youmei paused and smiled, "That's my mistake. I'll just go straight to her room, don't bother anyone else." So he lightened his steps, crossed several houses, and went upstairs. When he was upstairs, he was almost to Menglan's room, he was careless, and made his footsteps heavy, and the leather shoes stepped on the stairs with a thud. Then he heard Menglan say in the room: Xiaoju, I told you not to come upstairs and disturb me, why are you here again? Youmei laughed: The one who came is not chrysanthemum, but plum blossom, are you welcome? Menglan heard this, and went straight to the door to greet him, took his hand, and said with a wry smile: I was looking forward to you coming, you really came. Very good! With that, he pulled him into the room. (152)

### On the Revival of Kun Opera (Part 2)

— Qin Shouou

Moreover, in terms of facts, the reason why Kun opera is not easily understood by people is definitely not because of the depth of the lyrics, but because the scripts of Kun opera are not widely circulated and too few people know about them. Because they do not understand the plot, they are not easily interested. For example, people who do not understand English often like to watch foreign sound films. How can they understand the dialogue of the characters in the play? It is only because they read the synopsis first and have a full understanding of the plot that they can understand the expressions of the characters in the play, and thus develop an interest. Even people like us who understand a little American English, and ordinary people in the West, do not understand most of the singing in sound films, but their interest is not diminished at all. Therefore, if we want to save Kun opera from extinction today, the first thing we must not do is to scare people with high-sounding arguments such as "high art is only appreciated by a few". Secondly, we must distribute the lyrics in the theatre (the lyrics should be preceded by a brief summary of the entire plot) to increase the audience's interest.

However, the symptoms of Kun opera are already deep, and these two points alone can only prevent further deterioration. If we want it to flourish and expand, I think there are still several points that must be paid attention to:

(1) Add scenery: It is an undeniable fact that scenery can increase the audience's interest. For example, the garden tour in "Peony Pavilion", although the lyrics and expressions are already extremely beautiful, if we can add a garden scene, then its moving power will be doubled!

(2) Delete vaudeville: Not every scene in Kun opera is wonderful. Scenes such as "Beating Chen Cha", "Beating the Flower Drum", and "Major and Minor Frauds" can be said to be extremely boring and are most likely to give the audience a bad impression. They should be deleted and not performed.

(3) Rehearse new plays: I have read "The Ten Plays of Sheng Weng", "The Melody Score of the Eyun Pavilion", "The Legend of the Jade Lion Hall", etc., and I deeply feel that there are countless excellent plays that have not yet been performed by the Kun opera troupes today. In the future, those who study this art should not be afraid of hard work and should learn more new plays to make up for the bias and lack of today.

(4) Enhance the music: Kun opera has always been accompanied by the haidi flute, which is a bit monotonous. It should be accompanied by sheng, xiao, moon guitar, pipa, etc. Then the various sounds will resonate, and there will be a wonderful sound that you will never tire of hearing.

Talk

### More on the Spanish Civil War

— Me

Up to now, the Fascist side in the Spanish Civil War has not been able to completely occupy Madrid or completely eliminate the government forces, so it cannot be considered an absolute victory. To go one step further, it can be considered a 'mishap', because when the Spanish rebels raised their flags, they were in a fierce momentum, sweeping everything away, with the intention of annihilating their enemies in one go. But now that many days have passed, and the two sides have been winning and losing each other, rising and falling alternately, there is a great tendency to be deadlocked. This kind of power is naturally not the power of General Franco on the one hand, nor the power of the government forces on the other hand. Therefore, the success of General Franco this time is not the success of General Franco, but the success of the Fascist party. The failure of General Franco is not the failure of General Franco, but the failure of the Fascist party.

'Hitting a crying child, adults show up', this kind of situation has the possibility of evolving into a world war, but the reason why it has not yet evolved into a world war is because the time is not ripe. Since the European War, countries have learned from their pain and are inevitably disheartened. In addition, their vitality has been damaged and they urgently need to recuperate, so they have not had active preparations for military affairs. Only Germany and Italy have been preparing for war, burying their heads in hard work. Until last year, although they cannot be said to have absolute military preparations, they have had considerable military preparations. Therefore, once Germany rearmed and reclaimed lost territory, and Italy went on an expedition to Abyssinia, the English and French countries were almost at a loss. Therefore, the reason why the Spanish campaign did not turn into a second world war is due to this reason.

Although the non-Fascist faction is very weak towards the Fascist faction and dares not actively restrain it, the Spanish Civil War is a great area for comparing the skills of the two sides. The Fascist faction used the most modern weapons and full military support to help the rebels, but up to now, news of the government forces' victory is still coming from time to time, so the power of the Fascist faction can be imagined. And the non-Fascist faction still has considerable power, but the reason why the non-Fascist side is cautious in doing this is that if the war expands, the world will inevitably suffer, and this kind of price is immeasurable. Therefore, they have to take a patient attitude. Another reason is that they do not have absolute confidence in winning if a war breaks out, so they are expanding their military while perfunctorily compromising. The reason why the situation has not become extremely serious for a while lies in this.

But the Fascist faction believes that the attitude of the non-Fascist faction has softened and they dare not break with them, so they are flexing their muscles and acting freely, knowing that the time is not to be lost. If the non-Fascist faction has military preparations and unites as one, there will be no room for development. Therefore, if there is a possibility of causing a world war, it is not only the Spanish case, but also the September 18th Incident, the German army's entry into the Rhineland, and the Abyssinian expedition. They are all fuses for world wars. But although they have been lucky enough to escape now, there will always be a day when the two sides fight each other. That day will inevitably get closer and closer.

### Boating

— Lin Di

Our boat has been sailing for three days already.

The boat is fully loaded with heavy cargo: tobacco leaves, betel nuts, white sugar, large barrels of raw oil... the narrow boat is so crammed that there is almost no space to sleep, the boat is sinking so heavily in the sea!

Old Jin and I – we've been partners for a long time – rely on this boating to sell goods for a living. We sail along the hazy, green coastline, peddling our goods along the way, until everything is sold – this is our entire life.

Old Jin slowly rows the oars, fragrant water lilies float past with the rushing water. Tiny droplets of water splash under the oars. I hold the rudder, my bare legs crossed high: we are often calculating, planning, falling into a deathly silence. Our thoughts never leave our business, how can we make ourselves richer? Life is too hard!

'Old Jin, that debt from XX Company, they've been chasing us for it several times, what do you plan to do?'

'What else can we do? We can only wait until the grains are harvested.' Sweat has already flowed from Old Jin's broad, purple forehead, at this moment suddenly furrowing - slightly. His hands still row the oars tirelessly, the boat is too heavy, Old Jin seems to be struggling quite a bit.

'Qi Mao (the native's name) the hundred dollars of credit he owed last year, we have to sue him in court. Damn it, it's too much, the grain in the warehouse is all gone, but he's hiding it from us and not paying back.' Old Jin has mentioned this several times. This time, because someone is pressing us for debt, he angrily remembered that cunning fellow, Qi Mao.

'Let's think of a solution when we get back, anyway...' I grumbled impatiently, I was also annoyed by that hundred dollars – a large sum for us.

Then we both fell silent with our worries. The sound of the oars hitting the water, Old Jin's heavy breathing, seemed too desolate on this vast Irrawaddy River. The boat was pushed forward by the waves, the blue sky covered the boundless water, our boat was so small, in order to sell the goods quickly and rush back to replenish them, even if we encountered headwind, we could only struggle with manpower.

Whenever the boat arrived at a small village, we were familiar with them: we slowly moored the boat to the shore, greeted some old customers, the narrow boat was temporarily extremely lively. Sounds of greetings, sounds of weighing goods, noises of arguing over prices, all mixed into one. Some hypocritical courtesies, we could use them at this time, deception was also very common for us. Old Jin packed the goods, his face flushed:

'XX, one catty of white sugar, tobacco leaves...'

Quickly, I recorded the accounts in the running ledger. We also had to take advantage of the spare time to run around collecting debts. What was left was cooking, which was not at a fixed time. Some coarse rice, a plate of stinky fish sauce, was our daily meal. Then, we started the boat again and moved towards the endless journey. Life was so tasteless.

In July and August, the sea waves are very big. But our boating must continue. Often, the boat was difficult to move forward due to the large waves, and we did not reach the predetermined place, and the dark night attacked us. We had to moor the boat near the barren shoal, insert the bamboo pole deep into the water, and tie the boat and the bamboo pole together with hemp rope. The small kerosene lamps were all turned off, for fear of attracting attention. In these places, we often encountered robbers who came to rob and seize; they would rob all the money and goods, and even stab you with a bright knife and push the body into the water. This kind of massacre was often played out in this area, and every boatman had to be wary in advance. Quietly, with a worried heart, we took turns on night watch, the night seemed to deliberately make things difficult for us, creeping past without a sound moment by moment. In our minds, amazing scenes played out, the sound of leaves falling from trees, or fruits falling from trees, would startle us to trembling. The water flowed gurgling under the boat, the sky was full of stars, the sea was vast, shining in the darkness, and the time was approaching dawn.

Throughout the year, life never changed for us. We struggled in hardship, time slipped by year after year, and we still lived a bleak boating life. Sea waves, bitter rain, deathly loneliness, we were all already tired of.

Note 1: There are many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and Burma who live this kind of boating life. They carry goods to various small villages to peddle, one trip after another, without end.

Note 2: When boat merchants sell goods to natives, they rarely get cash. Mostly, they put the debt on credit and wait until the grain is harvested, then they repay with grains.

### Rain

— Bai Yan

A small watermelon-shaped boat emerged from under the bridge. At the bow and stern were men wearing straw raincoats and bamboo hats, holding bamboo poles. The boat was being propelled very quickly, and in just two or three strokes it was in front of me. The man at the bow was the boatman named Wang Xiao San. I waved and asked him:

'Going down the river in this weather?'

He said:

### Page 19

'Whether it's good or bad, there's no business. The water is high downstream, so I'm just rowing for fun.'

His words piqued my interest, and I said I'd go along. He hesitated for a moment, then asked if I had a raincoat. I said I didn't bring one, but even if it rained, I wouldn't mind getting a little wet. He shook his head, but another boatman suddenly volunteered:

'I'll go borrow a raincoat?'

They brought the boat to the shore, and the boatman ran into the village. Sure enough, after a while, he came back with a raincoat, and even brought a hat.

After getting on the boat, the sky became even darker, and a wind picked up on the lake. If not for the raincoat, I would definitely feel cold. When the boat passed the Peach Garden, I didn't see the hunchbacked, strange old beggar. That old fellow often made people laugh. When he saw students, he would shake his head and recite Tang poetry. When he saw someone wearing a Zhongshan suit or a diagonal leather belt, he would sing 'The National Revolution Succeeded'.

The boat arrived at Rainbow Bridge. The bridge opening was extremely low, and the people on the boat had to lower their heads to pass through. The water had risen a lot this year, and even the bamboo forest was submerged in water. The lotus pond was already connected to the lake, and the large goldfish that were originally in the pond had all gone. Only the largest opening in the middle of the Five Pavilion Bridge could be passed by a boat, and the other small openings were all hidden below the water's surface. The boatman said that this was all because of the rain. The river tide hadn't risen yet, so the water was still green. If the river water flowed in, it would become yellow.

The embankment, which was originally lined with willow trees and peach blossoms, was now also submerged in water. The lake surface seemed to be twice as large as usual. I thought about going around the mountain promontory to visit the monk who had been to university and also suffered a broken heart, but halfway there, the rain poured down. I had to turn back halfway. The boatman asked:

'Do you want to find a place to take shelter from the rain?'

I said:

'With a raincoat and hat, why take shelter from the rain? We might as well row in the rain for a while.'

Both boatmen laughed and said 'Okay'.

Raindrops hit the water surface, each one stirring up a large cluster of bubbles. The lake surface looked like it was boiling. The water, which usually looked like a mirror, now seemed to be covered with white feathers, fluttering in the wind. The rain sprinkled on the boat, the water, and the hat, all with a loud sound, but when it fell on the raincoat, it became a pleasant whisper. The rain was very dense, and water kept dripping down from the hat in front of my face. People in the rain saw everything as if through a heavy curtain, or like through a layer of frosted glass. More distant scenery seemed to be wrapped in mist. Looking back at the blue mountain in front, it was vaguely there and not there.

### Spring Outing

— Tian Qing

The spring scenery of the South is embroidered with intoxicating curtains.

Probably because of the climate, the creeping grass has already turned green all over the wilderness. The weeping willows have drawn out soft, emerald green whips, dancing their waists wildly in the breeze.

The peach blossoms have all bloomed, and the waters of the Magnolia Creek have also flooded. The gray geese exploring the spring water have already paddled their golden-yellow webbed feet, swimming leisurely on the water like boat girls. The fisherman has finished repairing his broken net and is re-loading his four bamboo poles arranged into a small raft, wandering on the shallow beach, ready to cast his net at any time. The cormorant squats on the bow of the raft, pretending to sleep – listening quietly to the sound of fish splashing in the water. Young people resent the cormorant's viciousness. But this is the true meaning of life, adding a vivid character to the scene of nature.

The rattan rafts coming from upstream are lined up into small islands. The girls washing clothes on the rafts naturally expose their legs and arms, gently pounding with wooden pestles. The people under the peach shade on the shore intentionally look down at the floating clouds at the bottom of the water, but frequently squint at the innocent face. Suddenly, the heavier sound of the pestle agitates the ripples on the water surface. Is the girl deliberately acting coquettishly? The ripples obscure that alluring inverted reflection. Making that passionate and joyful heart ripple slightly with anxious waves: the fire of youth burns and troubles his mind. In this embrace of nature, he forgets that he is still a person... Swallows draw silver arcs in pairs under the azure sky, dancing freely with steps that are not easily imitated, chirping and singing the tune of cherishing spring. Sometimes they gently skim across the surface of the water, making one suspect that they are a pair of lovebirds committing suicide, but they are all coming to show off this pair of beautiful shadows, and lightly fly to the horizon again. Those who are infatuated feel even more endless admiration and jealousy.

Everything in spring is full of intense vitality, even the night-blooming jasmine on the wall stretches out its soft, emerald green leaves, nurturing a fine bud, preparing to compete with the spring scenery.

The people going on a spring outing bring prepared offerings and gifts, carry ethnic lanterns, and climb in groups onto the mountain where their ancestral graves are located. Young people hold their most joyful partners and revel in the deep mountains and wilderness. Although there is no snow in the South, there is a riot of fallen flowers, spreading crimson over the green meadows of the wilderness. The partridge coos affectionately in the secluded forest, further intensifying the feeling of spring. The elderly quietly climb to the graves of their relatives, remove the overgrown weeds, level the flat ground in front of the graves, reverently offer sacrifices, kowtow, and calculate the feng shui that the 'geomancer' told them about. What kind of fortune will they have to follow this year? Then they cast a string of joyful and hopeful smiles, or disappointed and worried sighs. They also trace some of the deeds of their ancestors, lament for a while about the rights and wrongs of the current world, and also teach the young people to strive for honor for their ancestors.

All these childhood spring scenes are engraved very vividly and actively in my memory. But for several years, the spring scenery of my hometown has not belonged to me. I just trample on the cement pavements of the city, looking at the stupid street trees without any young buds: this place called the South, the green of the fragrant grass, is actually a sparse dream.

The beautiful spring scenery, it's time for a spring outing again. I remotely cherish my hometown three thousand miles away, recalling the fun of spring outings in my childhood, and even more missing the weeds on my father's grave, has anyone come to level them?

### The Relationship Between Vehicle Traffic and Streetlights

— Shuo

The Special Effect of New Lights

Whether streetlights are good or not is greatly related to the safety of vehicle traffic. Mr. Robinson, an electrical engineer in Liverpool, England, recently wrote an article discussing this issue, and his views are insightful. I will translate the main points below for the reference of those who are concerned about this issue.

The original purpose of installing public streetlights was to prevent theft on the roads. Today, in addition to preventing crime and promoting business, its greatest purpose is to facilitate road traffic and increase safety. Recently, as road traffic has become increasingly prosperous and highway construction is expensive, the problem of streetlights must be paid attention to in order for this investment to benefit in the future. Otherwise, dangers will arise, and the roads cannot be fully used. How can one expect to profit when it's like climbing a tree to catch fish?

The time from dusk to dawn in a year accounts for 45 percent. And during this dim period, the traffic on the road accounts for 40 percent of the total traffic. In addition, the busiest time for vehicle traffic every day is at night, when drivers are often fatigued from a day's work, which greatly affects their driving. The prosperity of commercial vehicle traffic on the roads all night is also increasing year by year.

Based on the above facts, it is very possible that night traffic can cause accidents and fatalities. The difference between this problem and daytime traffic is also very obvious. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, in addition to car headlights, we should focus on streetlights. It is difficult to solve the problem of car lights and traffic, and even the glare of car headlights can cause accidents. Therefore, drivers often dim their headlights when driving.

Regarding the issue of the safety of streetlights and road traffic, there is no accurate statistical material to be found in the United Kingdom. However, in the United States, there are many references. There are many examples where the accident rate has been reduced due to the solution of the streetlight problem. In some places, the original state of daytime accidents can be maintained, but the number of night accidents has increased instead. In addition, various statistics before and after the installation of streetlights show the benefits of streetlights. Generally, the accident rate can be reduced by 41 percent where there are streetlights. According to facts, half of the accidents in 24 hours occur at night. Therefore, after installing effective streetlights, the protection of safety, life, and money is very significant.

In the United Kingdom, the lighting installation of rural roads has not yet been very effective. The more prominent ones are in short sections of roads, and the streetlight styles are not uniform. This is because the management authorities are not consistent on a section of the road, so it is very difficult to achieve safety. In addition, it is not fair to ask small villages to bear the entire cost of streetlights, because the local traffic is not prosperous. Now the authorities use the amount of road use as the basis for the distribution of expenses, which is considered fair.

It may be worthwhile to talk about what is called an appropriate streetlight plan. First, we must know the relationship between roads and objects. Anyone who wants to ensure the safety of the road surface should take the ability to clearly see objects on the road surface as the only condition. During the day, objects and their environment, and their color efficiency, make extremely clear contrasts. But under any artificial light, the color contrast completely fails. Only brightness can be sought. Even in broad daylight, the contrast between the brightness of objects on the road and the road surface appears dark. This is partly due to the direction of the light and partly because even though roads and objects receive the same light, objects are often darker than roads. Due to the manifestation of this fact, in road lighting equipment, it is often desired that objects receive as little light as possible, while the road surface should be illuminated more to make objects appear darker on the bright road surface.

It is not easy to achieve the above-mentioned ideal in practice. However, as a result of careful research, some light source tools have finally been obtained that are deeply practical. Among them, the sodium lamp, which uses electrical emission, is used more widely. This light is a soft golden yellow and is easy to distinguish. In many ways, this sodium lamp can solve the difficult problems of streetlights. The golden light can increase visual clarity, because the eyes of ordinary people are clearer under this special light. Therefore, the above-mentioned contrast between objects and the road surface becomes more clear. Economically speaking, under the same consumption as ordinary lights, the brightness can be increased five times, and its durability can be increased three times.

If you want to obtain the greatest visibility under any kind of lighting, the first thing you must do is eliminate the glare. For example, if a mesh reflector is suspended in the middle of the road and sodium lamps are used, the effect of the light is like daylight. Then all glare can be found. Everything on the road and sidewalk is extremely clear. If a road has such streetlights, headlights can be eliminated, and its safety and reliability will be beyond doubt.

### Overview of the American Automobile Industry in the Past Year (Continued)

— Ying

Passenger car sales. In fact, this year is not as stable as truck sales. Generally speaking, in the United States. The automobile market. Can be divided into four seasons a year. But trucks, as everyone knows, have no seasonal divisions. Regardless of the first or second half of the year. Sales are always very stable. Every year. There are four or five months. Roughly from April to August. The registration numbers for each month are extremely stable. Without much fluctuation. But in winter. Truck sales will have special development. This year, the sales of trucks from various American factories. Are also distributed more evenly than in previous years. Because in the past few years of recession. It can be said that most of the trucks sold. Were manufactured by the four major automobile factories. And small automobile factories accounted for only a very small number. But this year is an exception. Because according to general estimates, the four major automobile factories accounted for 89 percent of all trucks sold in the United States in 1936. And 92 percent in 1935. The so-called independent small automobile factories. Were able to improve their position this year. On the one hand, because in addition to heavy-duty trucks. They also manufactured light-duty trucks. And this year, heavy-duty trucks were competing more fiercely in the market. Most truck buyers ordered special bodies. Mounted on the chassis. As for the chassis. Of course, they were also purchased from truck manufacturers. And the bodies were made by general automobile factories. Among them, many were the result of trial use in the previous year. And had achieved considerable results.

Finally, what we want to say is that American factories. Have mostly finalized their car manufacturing plans for 1937. Studebaker and Packard fully adopted the latest methods. To manufacture new cars. Recently, they have been publicly sold in the market. Buick held a sales conference at the Flint General Factory in the first week of October. Gathering managers and car dealers from all over the country, as well as representatives from the factory, to discuss the business policies for 1937. As a result, it has been decided to expand the scope of car sales in various parts of the United States. In early October. Several automobile factories exhibited prototypes of the new cars for 1937. To show that the new cars for next year will be manufactured according to the prototypes. At least two automobile factories. Had already decided on the manufacturing of the new cars at that time. Following the exhibition of the new cars. Public exhibitions were held one after another in various parts of the United States in the last two months. (The End)
