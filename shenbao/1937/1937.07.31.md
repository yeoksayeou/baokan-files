### Japanese Army Sets Fires and Massacres Civilians Everywhere

[Nanjing] According to reports from relevant sources, the Japanese army occupied various places in Hebei and the city again around 7:00 PM on the 30th. In addition to dispatching soldiers to guard the streets, many Japanese soldiers set fire to the area around the Security Command on Yuejin and Weilu Roads with kerosene, causing widespread fires. When residents fled, the Japanese army fired machine guns at them, leaving corpses strewn across the streets. Their cruelty is outrageous. The Telephone Bureau No. 6 had restored communication on the 29th, but it was interrupted again on the evening of the 30th. Now, refugees from various places are arriving in droves, seeking refuge in the British and French Concessions. Many were killed by Japanese machine guns while passing through the Dongma Road area. Moreover, Guozhuangzi in Hedong was also burned and then strafed by the Japanese army at noon on the 30th, resulting in the deaths of many innocent civilians. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Japanese Side Announces Details of the Bombing of Tianjin

[Tokyo] At noon on the 30th, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry met with foreign reporters and issued a written statement on the air raid on Tianjin on the 29th. The gist of it was that before the air raid, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin had issued a statement saying that the Chinese Security Forces were using the City Government, Public Security Bureau, Ningyuan, and Balitai as bases to attack the Japanese Concession. The Japanese army had no other choice but to carry out the air raid due to the urgency. It also stated that the bombing of the Beining Railway Bureau and Nankai University was because the 26th Independent Brigade of the Chinese army was using Nankai University as a base, and the 38th Division was using the Railway Bureau as a base to attack the Japanese Concession. When asked if the civilians had been notified before the air raid, the reply was that no detailed report had been received. When asked if there was a so-called autonomous movement in Beiping, the reply was that it was heard that a public safety maintenance committee was being organized to maintain public order, but it was not known whether it was autonomous or not. This was a matter of China's internal affairs. Chinese custom was that after the army retreated, representatives of the people would organize a maintenance of public order organ, but there was a possibility of establishing autonomy. If this movement were to emerge or seek assistance from the Japanese authorities, Japan could not but provide assistance. When asked if Prime Minister Konoe stated in Parliament that Japan had respected Chinese sovereignty for forty years, whether the Japanese authorities would prevent the autonomous organ established in Beiping from being recognized by the Nanjing government, the spokesman replied that Japan had no obligation to prevent it, as it was a matter of China's internal affairs. It was also asked about the situation in South China. The reply was that anti-Japanese sentiment was quite strong in Guangzhou and Shantou, and it was difficult for Japanese residents to purchase food and they might have to evacuate.

### Martial Law Lifted in Beiping, City Extremely Desolate

[Beiping] All obstacles in Beiping have been completely removed, and all city gates are wide open. Martial law has been declared lifted. However, most shops remain closed, and the city is desolate and miserable. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Beiping] Most banks in Beiping did not open for business on the 29th, but resumed normal operations on the 30th. However, many people were holding banknotes from the Hebei Provincial Bank in front of the bank on the 30th, exchanging them for legal tender from other banks. The bank therefore extended its business hours and implemented unlimited exchange, so shops are using that bank's notes in practice. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### The Uprising Telegram from the Tongxian Security Forces

[Baoding] After Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian, the commanders of the First and Second Detachments of the Tongxian Security Forces, led over 20,000 officers and soldiers in an uprising, they issued a telegram on the 30th, stating that after the Battle of the Great Wall, they were under the command of Yin Rugeng. Unexpectedly, the traitor Yin willingly became a puppet, and was abandoned by both gods and men. At the time, they were forced by circumstances to endure humiliation and wait for an opportunity until now. They swore an oath to the troops at dawn on the 29th to crush all the organs of the puppet organization and capture the garrison team stationed in Tongxian, as well as the police station's and other significant traitors. They fought tooth and nail with the enemy on that day. From now on, all actions will be carried out under the orders of Chairman Chiang and Commander Song. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Tianjin Entirely Ablaze, Extinguished After Heavy Rain

[Nanjing] According to reports from relevant sources, it rained heavily in Tianjin at 1:00 AM on the 31st, lasting for a quarter of an hour. The flames that were set by the Japanese army on the evening of the 30th have gradually been extinguished as a result. As of 2:00 AM on the 31st, intermittent sounds of gunfire were still heard here, as the Japanese army is now deployed throughout the city, constantly firing guns and artillery as a show of force. Traffic throughout the city is increasingly cut off. Further investigation reveals that the Japanese army set fire to Hebei on the evening of the 30th, and the Northern Telephone Bureau was completely destroyed. The Aquatic School outside the railway also caught fire after being hit by incendiary bombs. After the residents near the East Railway Station were driven out, the Japanese army set fire to it.

### Japanese Planes Continue to Bomb Nankai

[Tianjin] At 3:00 PM on the 30th, four Japanese planes continued to drop incendiary bombs on Nankai Middle School. The fire is currently raging fiercely. At the same time, the Japanese artillery unit also fired at Nankai University from Haiguang Temple, hitting a total of four shells. The back of the library of the university is also currently on fire. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Tianjin] Two Japanese planes arrived at Nankai Middle School again around 3:00 PM on the 30th and dropped several bombs. The extent of the damage is not yet known. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] For the past two days, Japanese planes have dropped bombs and caused devastating damage in Tianjin. The entire city's attention is focused on the smoke and fire at Balitai Nankai University. Because the Japanese bombing on the 29th only hit two or three large buildings, in order to completely destroy them, the Japanese sent over a hundred cavalrymen and several vehicles loaded with kerosene at around 3:00 PM on the 30th to set fires everywhere. The Xiushan Hall, the Siyuan Hall (the two largest buildings in the school), the library, the faculty dormitories, and the nearby civilian houses were engulfed in flames. There were over a dozen sources of fire, red and black juxtaposed, black and white interspersed. The smoke and clouds covered the sky, and those who looked up at the fire sighed incessantly. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Tianjin] This afternoon, Japanese bombers were very active again, launching a large-scale attack on the undamaged parts of Nankai University and various places in the northwest of Tianjin City. A large fire broke out in the educational area west of the city. It is said that both Nankai Girls' School and Middle School were destroyed. According to Chinese refugees, Chinese courts were all bombed and destroyed by Japanese planes. After the Japanese planes left, the streets were littered with corpses. Nankai University is constructed of steel and reinforced concrete, so although it was bombed, it did not catch fire. The Japanese then dispatched soldiers carrying kerosene to set it on fire. Japanese soldiers also took oil to nearby villages to carry out arson. The Japanese authorities cited the excuse that Chinese soldiers had repeatedly fired at the Japanese from there as the reason for today's Japanese aircraft activity. Several foreigners went to Nankai for inspection this afternoon. There was no one there except Japanese soldiers, and the Japanese soldiers pointed their machine guns at them. City soldiers and police have disappeared since the bombing, causing bandits to run rampant, and the public is becoming more and more panicked. The security force of the Third Special District has now withdrawn, so it is entirely occupied by Japanese soldiers. Only the Second Special District still has a security force. The Japanese authorities are worried about a counterattack by the Chinese soldiers tonight, and are very uneasy. At 5:00 PM this afternoon, two Japanese soldiers rode bicycles from the yarn factory area in the south of the First Special District toward the British Concession, but were stopped by the police station of the British Concession. The Japanese soldiers then got off their bicycles and fired Mauser rifles into the air, causing panic. British soldiers were called out and set up obstacles to implement alert measures.

### The Situation of Refugees in Exile is Utterly Miserable

[Tianjin] After the Japanese planes bombed Tianjin extensively on the 29th, a large number of refugees, about a thousand people, went to Special District 2, intending to enter the Italian Concession to take refuge, but were refused. These thousand-plus people then spent the night in the open on Da'an Street in Special District 2, and only gradually passed through Special District 3 of the Italian Concession and across the Wanguo Bridge to the French Concession this morning. Everywhere is crowded with people on the streets, and there are more and more pedestrians, all of whom have nowhere to go. This morning, corpses were exposed everywhere along Hebei Dongma Road, especially many young children. Even more were seriously injured and dying, and the situation was extremely miserable. It is heard that when the Japanese planes were dispatched yesterday, they first dropped sulfur bombs, causing houses to burn, and people fled in all directions. The Japanese planes then flew low and strafed with machine guns, causing many innocent civilians to suffer. In addition, the number of people who were bombed or burned to death in various institutions and residences is also impossible to calculate. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] According to reports from relevant sources, there was a heavy rain in Tianjin on the morning of the 30th. Most of the refugees in the Hebei area of Special District 3 were women and children crawling across the river in the rain, and the situation was very miserable. In addition, a group of employees from the Hebei General Station were sent by the Japanese to the front of the Bank of Communications in the French Concession and disembarked. These employees were still carrying Yang flags or oil cans, not forgetting their duties. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### French Consul in Tianjin Protests to the Japanese Army

### Rumors from Japanese Sources of Beiping Assembling Public Order Maintenance Committee

[Tokyo] According to Japanese sources in North China, a Public Order Maintenance Committee has been formed in Beiping today, consisting of forty members. The Beiping City, Chamber of Commerce, Bankers' Association, Press, Autonomous Organizations, and important citizens each elected six representatives to form it, with Jiang Chaozong as the chairman, assisted by six standing committee members. Zhang Zizhong, the new mayor of Beiping, made great efforts to seek the position of chairman, but was opposed by all parties. It is said that the Japanese authorities also believe that if important figures from the 29th Army and the Hebei-Chahar Political Council are still in the new committee and hold responsible positions, the situation in Beiping will be difficult to be clear. (Central News Agency, 30th Reuters Dispatch)

[Beiping] The Japanese artillery unit bombarded Xiyuan from two miles away this morning. Twenty Japanese planes landed on the square near the Summer Palace today. Other Japanese troops are chasing the Hebei-Eastern Security Forces that retreated from Tongxian. Tongxian has now fallen back into the hands of the Japanese army. According to soldiers who fled here from various locations along the Ping-Sui Railway, fighting also broke out near Nankou yesterday, and villagers in the area fled southwest. When the Japanese army shelled Wanping last night, there were many civilian casualties. The Japanese army then advanced and occupied the city before midnight. It is said that the Japanese military authorities initially insisted that Japanese personnel should participate in the security committee, but the Chinese leaders opposed it, saying that it might cause a reaction from the Chinese police, so the matter was dropped. This morning, Zhang Zizhong visited Matsui in Jiaomin Lane to discuss the matter. Japanese military officer Imai declared that the Japanese authorities were deeply concerned about the future of the thousand Japanese residents and the one thousand two hundred Korean residents currently taking refuge in Jiaomin Lane, and earnestly hoped that the area would return to normal so that they could return home as soon as possible. According to Chinese sources, even if Japanese personnel do not participate in the security committee, they will still demand to be involved in maintaining security in Beiping. At the same time, the Chinese people are still extremely frightened. Although all Chinese banks reopened this morning, most shops still remained closed. (Central News Agency, 30th Reuters Dispatch)

[Beiping] The Beiping Public Order Maintenance Committee was formed this afternoon, with forty members, all of whom are not from the political circles. This committee only has advisory powers and no administrative powers, with the 78-year-old Jiang Chaozong as the chairman. The Japanese here are very anxious about the Tianjin incident, because they have not received any news from Tianjin since last night. (Central News Agency, 30th Reuters Dispatch)

### Zhao and Tong's Loyal Remains Recovered and Placed in Coffins

Zhao Claimed That Loyalty and Filial Piety Cannot Be Fulfilled Simultaneously, and Advised His Mother Not to Grieve

[Beiping] The loyal remains of Zhao Dengyu, commander of the 132nd Division of the 29th Army, and Tong Linge, deputy commander of the 29th Army and education director of the military officer training regiment, have been found. They were placed in coffins together on the 30th, and the coffins were temporarily placed in Longquan Temple. The citizens were all in tears upon hearing of Zhao and Tong's valiant resistance and unfortunate death. According to Zhao's guard, when the battle was fierce, Commander Zhao was directing the battle near Tuanhe when he was suddenly hit by a bullet and injured in the left arm. I wanted to carry him back, but the commander refused and continued to advance. Before long, he was injured again in the leg and shoulder. I urged the commander to retreat, and the commander said to me, "Return to Beiping quickly and tell my mother, 'Loyalty and filial piety cannot be fulfilled simultaneously. If I am unfortunately killed, please ask my mother not to grieve.'" I tried to persuade him but failed, and had no choice but to return to Beiping and report to the commander's mother at her residence in Xinsi Hutong, Houmen. After that, I did not know any further information. It is also said that Deputy Commander Tong was suddenly shot in the lower part of his leg by a machine gun at the front line. Tong fell forward because he was running. Just then, a shell came and hit his head, resulting in his death. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Nankai University Destroyed by Bombing, Deep Grief Expressed by All Quarters

Japanese Intend to Destroy Our Culture, Zhang Boling Determined to Continue Efforts

[Nanjing] Tianjin Nankai University, painstakingly established by the late founder Mr. Yan Fansun and the current President Dr. Zhang Boling over the past forty years, now comprises four divisions: a university, a boys' middle school, a girls' middle school, and a primary school, with a total of over 3,000 students. The university and middle school divisions were detested by the Japanese army and destroyed by bombing with airplanes and cannons over the past two days. People from China and abroad were all shocked and indignant. In the capital, educational and academic figures, besides Education Minister Wang, who personally visited Mr. Zhang on the morning of the 30th to express profound condolences, alumni of the school in Nanjing also flocked to Mr. Zhang to express their deep concern for their alma mater. This reporter also visited on the afternoon of the 30th and was received. Mr. Zhang first expressed his gratitude for the condolences from various quarters. He then stated that what was destroyed by the enemy's bombing of Nankai was the material aspect of Nankai, but the spirit of Nankai would be even more invigorated by this setback. Therefore, he was not at all concerned about the material losses suffered by Nankai this time, and he would further establish a new life for Nankai based on the consistent spirit of the founding of the school. He himself would only rely on this spirit and would never be discouraged. He firmly believed that it would not be difficult to establish a new scale in the short term. A Nankai office has now been established in Nanjing, and all matters concerning the upcoming semester are being planned urgently. When Mr. Zhang spoke, his attitude was extremely serious, and his firm and unyielding will was fully expressed in his eyes and speaking posture. After expressing condolences, this reporter took leave. According to Mr. Zhang, Nankai School has been established for nearly forty years. Initially, the middle school department was established, and subsequently, the university department, girls' middle school department, and primary school department were added successively. With excellent results, it has gained the support of people from home and abroad, as well as the government and society. The annual funding for each department of the school is mostly subsidized by the Ministry of Education and donations from various quarters. When it was founded, there were only six students, but now there are more than 3,000. The original school buildings were only a few bungalows, but recently they have increased to dozens, large and small. The Muzhai Library (one of the most famous libraries in the country), Xiushan Hall (i.e., offices and classrooms for the College of Arts, Commerce, and Science), Zhiqin Building (i.e., girls' dormitory), etc., which were bombed by the military on the 29th, are all magnificent buildings in the school. In addition to the Colleges of Arts, Sciences, and Commerce, the university department also has the Nankai Economic Research Institute and the Nankai Chemical Experiment Institute, both of which are well-known throughout the country. In particular, the various publications and price indexes issued by the Economic Research Institute are highly reputable in economic circles at home and abroad. Moreover, the school buildings of each department are all close to the Japanese barracks and Japanese airfield in Tianjin. Since the September 18th Incident, teachers and students in the classrooms have heard the enemy's target practice and airplane sounds almost every day. However, the school's discipline has always been the same because Mr. Zhang advocated strict training, studying to save the country, and working hard. It has always maintained a calm and prudent attitude towards general impulsive patriotic proposals. Now, even disregarding the violence, it is not difficult to prove here that the enemy is determined to fundamentally destroy our national culture. People from China and abroad have expressed deep regret and indignation at the innocent destruction of the school, as it is not only a famous cultural institution in our country but also the product of the blood and sweat of countless intellectuals over the past forty years. (Central News Agency, 30th)

[Nanjing] After Nankai University was detested and bombed by the Japanese army, Education Minister Wang was extremely grieved upon hearing the news on the evening of the 29th.

Zhang expressed to Wang that he was determined to continue working for Nankai for the rest of his life and would never give up halfway. Wang solemnly stated that after the great upheaval is quelled, the government will be responsible for restoring the school to its original scale. (Central News Agency, 30th)

Although they are now making every effort to prevent the incident from spreading to various places, if accidents occur in various places, resulting in a situation that cannot be resolved, then the Japanese Third Fleet will only take the necessary measures. They sincerely hope that the Chinese authorities will work hard to prevent the occurrence of unfortunate incidents in Central and South China. (Central News Agency, 30th)

### United States Does Not Implement Neutrality Law on Sino-Japanese Disputes

Hull Announces After Meeting Roosevelt; Pittman Also Issues Powerful Remarks

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull, after consulting with President Roosevelt, announced that the State Department has not yet recommended that the President declare a state of war between China and Japan, so that the Neutrality Law would take effect. The situation in the Far East remains serious, but the United States will not take any special action at this time. Hull also stated that British Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons that the British government has notified the Japanese government that Britain would not approve of the continued advance of Japanese troops in China. He has not yet received formal notification from the British side. At the same time, State Department officials stated that they do not advocate keeping the U.S. 10th Infantry Regiment stationed in Tianjin, but they feel that the team must remain stationed there now to avoid giving the Japanese the impression that the United States agrees with their actions and to avoid China viewing the withdrawal as an unfriendly act. The general impression here is that the Boxer Protocol stipulates that foreign troops guard the Tianjin-Beiping railway. Now, because Japan has repeatedly taken aggressive actions, the signatory countries to the agreement have not protested, so it has become a dead letter. The State Department is still studying the issue of withdrawing American troops from Tianjin and Beiping. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 29th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull and President Roosevelt's special envoy, Davis, went to the White House to pay a visit to President Roosevelt to discuss the situation in North China. When reporters questioned Hull about the situation in the Far East, Hull did not express anything clearly. Semi-official figures in the United States now believe that the safety of the 1,200 American residents in Beiping and Tianjin is quite endangered. In addition, Japanese planes have dropped bombs in Tianjin, threatening the foreign residential areas of the city. Official figures believe that the United States is determined to maintain the safety of American residents in Tianjin and Beiping, but this should be taken by the commanders of the American troops stationed in Tianjin and Beiping. In short, the attitude that the United States is now expressing is to try to avoid incidents with China or Japan, so that the conflict between China and Japan can be more easily resolved. (Central News Agency, Havas, 29th)

[Washington] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement today opposing the United States invoking the Neutrality Law for the Sino-Japanese conflict. The outside world attaches great importance to this, as Pittman is a powerful spokesman for the government in Congress on foreign policy. The current proposal is often issued at the direction of President Roosevelt. Pittman believes that invoking the Neutrality Law would hinder efforts to save peace in North China and endanger the position of American residents in China. Pittman continued that President Roosevelt is making every effort to eliminate the scourge of war, and no government should undermine this effort for peace and humanity. Moreover, the Neutrality Law is not a treaty and should not protect or harm any country. Its purpose is only to protect the peace of the United States itself and the safety of its people. If President Roosevelt declares that China and Japan are in a state of war, and the two countries declare a ceasefire soon after, then the President's declaration would be a clear misunderstanding, and this declaration would seriously endanger American residents in China. (National News, 29th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull today continued to receive reports from American embassies and consulates in China and Japan, stating that the situation in the Far East remains serious and promptly informing President Roosevelt. Officials are maintaining a reserved attitude towards the declaration of Chinese Chairman Chiang. As for the impact of the recent Sino-Japanese conflict on the issue of Philippine independence, a number of senators believe that American policy will not change as a result. Senator Pepper said that the current crisis is only temporary in nature and will not affect American policy. However, he believes that this is not the time to negotiate the issue of neutrality for the Philippines. Senator Poppah said that the current crisis further proves why the United States should not change its current relationship with the Philippines. If we were to grant the Philippines independence in the near future, then there would be no one to prevent Japan from annexing the Philippines. There is no reason to change the principles of the current independence law. He supports opening discussions on the issue of Philippine neutrality as soon as possible. Senator Crawford said that the situation in the Far East is like a volcano, and we should openly discuss the issue of Philippine independence. (National News, 29th)

[New York] According to the New York Times, government sources have revealed that the US government plans to ask China and Japan for a ceasefire of four or five days, so that all foreigners in dangerous areas can withdraw completely. It is too dangerous to rescue universities under the current circumstances. The Japanese army only guarantees not to bomb major cities with foreign residential areas, and it is feared that they will not be able to fulfill this guarantee if the war intensifies. Even if the Japanese government declares its most beautiful intentions, it is feared that this will not be reliable. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 30th)

### British Foreign Secretary Issues Declaration on Situation in Far East

Willing to Exert All Efforts to Promote Peace; Still Maintaining Contact with the United States and France

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden issued a statement on the situation in the Far East at the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, stating, "Regarding the promotion of peace and the maintenance of harmony, the government of our country is happy to do everything within its power. This is our sole goal." The Foreign Secretary then reiterated that he is still in close contact with the United States and France, regretting that the dispute between China and Japan is becoming increasingly serious. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 30th)

[London] The crisis in the Far East was again raised for discussion by Labour Party leader Attlee during the final debate on foreign policy questions in the House of Commons today. Attlee said, "The situation in the Far East seems to be transforming into a major war." Attlee also said that the Chinese have consistently gone to the limit of maintaining peace, but every concession has led to further aggression. If these events are allowed to continue rampant, its meaning is that all treaties, including those in which we and the United States have participated, will be rendered void. Attlee continued that the League of Nations should now pay attention to the events happening in the Far East. The current trend in the world is that aggressive countries are taking advantage of the unpreparedness of other countries to plunder. Therefore, unless the countries of the world no longer stand idly by and watch innocent countries being invaded, this kind of speculative panic will continue to occur without end. Conservative MP Boothby then said that he felt that if the United States did not act, Britain would feel isolated and helpless. Moreover, the League of Nations is already extremely weak, and dragging it into the whirlpool would be useless and would only hasten its demise. Therefore, the only way forward now is for us to act jointly with the United States, as the feelings between Britain and the United States are at their peak today. Foreign Secretary Eden then rose to reply, saying that he agreed with Attlee's opinion, that the situation had greatly deteriorated since yesterday's meeting. Eden continued that the British government was extremely saddened by these events, especially as the international relations in the Far East had seemed to be improving recently, but now it seemed to have vanished. Eden also said, "We still believe that the interests of the countries of the Far East lie in the maintenance of peace. Whichever country can apply a peaceful policy, dispel hatred, and engage in peaceful development, its benefits will far outweigh what it can gain by force." Eden added that Britain will continue to communicate with countries such as France and the United States. We should follow the footsteps of the United States and be prepared to travel together, but not to exceed the United States. Furthermore, the purpose of Britain is to exert its individual national strength to the best of its ability and to increase international peace and coordination. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 30th)

[London] Several Members of Parliament raised questions about the situation in the Far East at today's session of the House of Commons, and Foreign Secretary Eden answered them one by one, roughly stating that it was true that Japanese planes and artillery had bombed the vicinity of the city of Beiping. He then gave a report on the position of British residents in the Beiping area and said that the British ambassador to Japan had requested the Japanese government to guarantee the safety of British residents in Beiping. Major Attlee, leader of the Labour Party's trade union, then asked whether the conflict between China and Japan should be submitted to the League of Nations for handling. Eden replied that the United States and Japan were not members of the League of Nations, "As for Britain itself, it does not intend to initiate anything in this matter at present." Major Attlee immediately protested upon hearing this, but Eden said that the current situation in the Far East has special characteristics and must be taken into consideration carefully. At this point, another Labour MP, Wedgwood, questioned the government, "Is Foreign Secretary Eden prepared to make it clear to the Japanese government that if any provinces of China are again separated from the sovereignty of the central government, the British government will not be able to approve of it?" Eden replied, only saying, "Yes, regarding this matter, declarations have been issued repeatedly in the last two days. We are very saddened by the situation in North China, as we had hoped that the situation in the Far East could be generally improved, but this is impossible under the current circumstances." Major Attlee then said that he would raise this issue again before the House of Commons adjourns tomorrow afternoon. (Central News Agency, Havas, 29th)

### French Newspapers Comment on Sino-Japanese Problem

Great Powers' Wait-and-See Attitude Is Deemed Strange

[Paris] Since the outbreak of the incident in the Far East, most of the countries involved have adopted a passive attitude, which most French newspapers find very strange. For example, the Radical Party's "Republican Newspaper" said, "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict in North China, the Soviet Union has been completely silent, which is quite astonishing. It seems that Japan began to launch the war after the execution of former Soviet Army Chief of Staff Tukhachevsky, and these two events are probably not a coincidence and should be noted. Judging from all the past circumstances, the Japanese government probably has a large network of spies and is well aware of the internal weaknesses of the Soviet Union, so it believes that the present is the best time to realize its planned plan in China." The General Confederation of Labor's organ "People's Newspaper" stated, "The great powers know that Japan's actions are enough to endanger the interests of all countries in China, destroy the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington, and prepare for a great war in Asia, the goal of which is not limited to China, but they are still allowing Japan to do as it pleases, which is unwise." The Communist Party's organ "News" stated, "The Japanese Social Mass Party and various democratic factions are supporting the Konoe Cabinet in the House of Representatives, and the fact that all countries are dealing with it passively is not right. In the past, all countries have already allowed China to deal with the imperialist invaders alone without providing assistance, and now they are repeating the same mistake. The Britain now controlled by people like Eden is still betraying peace." The moderate "Order" newspaper stated, "Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito has given assurances to the US State Department that the actions of the Japanese army are not intended to cross the line 32 kilometers south of the Tianjin-Beiping railway line, but American political figures do not want to comment on this. In addition, British Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday issued a statement in the House of Commons saying that Britain does not intend to submit the Sino-Japanese conflict issue to the League of Nations. As for the Soviet Union, seeing Japan extend its influence south of Huaping, which is enough to reduce the threat to Outer Mongolia, it will naturally not take it as a suffering."

### Xiao Zhenying

Arrives in Honolulu En Route Home

[Honolulu] Former Tianjin Mayor and Chief of Staff of the 29th Army Xiao Zhenying arrived here today by plane on the Pacific Air Line and will take the original plane to China tomorrow. Xiao said that he will first go to Nanjing and hopes to go to Beiping, but this depends on the orders of the central government. It is not yet certain whether Song Zheyuan's resignation as Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council will affect his plans. (National News, 29th)

### Hirota Explains "Local Situation" with Sinister Intent, National Attention

Tokyo The House of Representatives opened a budget meeting at 10 a.m. this morning. Seiyukai Dongwu questioned what the government meant by adopting the principle of local resolution for the North China Incident.

Foreign Minister Hirota replied that the Chinese government still does not recognize "Manchukuo", but the Japanese government, based on various agreements between Japan and Manchukuo, considers the area bordering "Manchukuo" as the local situation and strives to maintain the security of "Manchukuo". In short, all areas necessary to maintain the security of "Manchukuo" are the local situation.

Dongwu asked the Prime Minister about his determination to thoroughly address the situation.

Prime Minister Itsuwe replied, "The Japanese government is doing its utmost to avoid a full-scale war, and even today, we have not abandoned hope for peace. However, the hope of the situation will be pursued if the people work together." (30th Allied Press)

### The Twenty-Two Countries Respond to the Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War

Russia Insists on Opposing Recognition of Belligerent Groups; Compromise Plan May Be Impossible to Implement

[London] The Spanish Civil War non-intervention issue, which may affect the current situation in northern China, is at a standstill. The Soviet Union is still opposed to recognizing both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups, so it is unknown whether the British compromise plan can be implemented. Prime Minister Chamberlain met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday afternoon, urging the Soviet government to change its attitude, and told him that if the countries concerned continue to dispute over the Spanish Civil War, they will not be able to jointly mediate the dispute between China and Japan. Maisky replied that although Italy had issued a statement saying that it would not allow a communist regime to be established in Spain, the Soviet Union did not insist on eliminating the Spanish National Army government, but it would not allow Italy to intervene in the Iberian Peninsula. (Havas Radio on the 30th of the Central English News Agency)

[London] The questionnaire sent by the Non-Intervention Committee to its member states some time ago requested that governments clearly express their views on the resumption of the Spanish border monitoring plan, the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, and the issue of conditionally recognizing the rights of belligerent groups. The committee secretariat has now received replies from 22 countries. The subcommittee will convene a meeting tomorrow to review the replies of the countries.

It is reported that although the answers of the major countries generally express recognition, most are accompanied by significant reservations. For example, the Soviet Union insists that the Moorish troops in the Spanish National Army should be regarded as foreign volunteers and withdrawn uniformly, and that the rights of belligerent groups should not be granted to the Spanish National Army. At least, this must wait until the volunteers have completely withdrawn. After the volunteers withdraw, the Soviet Union is willing to reconsider its position. Apart from this, it has essentially accepted the British proposal. London sources say that the Soviet Union will not be so insistent on the rights of belligerent groups as to risk the plan breaking down. Germany, on the other hand, said that the granting of the rights of belligerent groups to the Spanish National Army should be carried out at the same time as the withdrawal of volunteers, which means that the Spanish National Army should first obtain the status of a belligerent group, because the withdrawal of volunteers is a complicated matter and will naturally take longer. Germany also argued that the interests of belligerent groups should include air warfare, so that the Geneva Convention on the Restriction of Aerial Bombardment could be applied to both sides of the Spanish Civil War.

Italy's attitude is even more frank, but it insists that the time for granting the benefits of belligerent groups should be discussed and determined by the United Kingdom with all parties concerned. Belgium has unconditionally accepted the British proposal. (Reuters from the Central News Agency on the 19th)

London. Regarding the non-intervention issue in the Spanish Civil War, the Coordination Committee will hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss it. People generally expect that there may not be any specific results after the meeting. Some pessimists fear that the compromise plan proposed by the British government will eventually be abandoned, and predict that the two issues of withdrawing foreign volunteers from Spain and recognizing both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups will remain the main obstacles. Firstly, the Soviet government's reply clearly rejected the British plan's stipulation that the belligerent groups be recognized after a large number of volunteers have withdrawn, and only acknowledged the possibility of recognizing belligerent groups after all volunteers have withdrawn. Secondly, the German reply argued that the withdrawal of volunteers and the recognition of belligerent groups should be carried out simultaneously, regardless of priority, and the British plan advocated that before the Coordination Committee establishes an agreement, it should authorize the United Kingdom to negotiate with both sides of the Spanish Civil War on the two issues of recognizing belligerent groups and withdrawing volunteers, which is also unacceptable to Germany. Thirdly, the Italian reply suggested that the belligerent groups should be recognized immediately after consulting with the Spanish Republican government and the National Army authorities. These three opinions are obviously contradictory. However, diplomatic circles believe that the Soviet reply does not represent Moscow's attitude. If the objections expressed by the Soviet Union can be accommodated and changed, then negotiations may still continue. Therefore, some people attach great importance to the talks between Prime Minister Chamberlain and Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon. (Havas Radio on the 29th of the Central News Agency)

### The League of Nations Mandates Commission Meets to Discuss the Palestine Issue

The Arab Delegation Submits a Memorandum Opposing the Report of the British Royal Commission

The committee convened an extraordinary meeting this morning to discuss the Palestine issue. Representatives from both the Jewish and Arab sides attended. This meeting was chaired by Mr. Orts. The committee held a meeting last year to discuss the Palestine dispute, but the dispute was not resolved because the mandated government was late in submitting its report. At today's meeting, the chairman reported on the work of the committee, first reviewing the reports of the mandated government for 1935 and 1936. After the review, the report of the British Royal Commission and the memorandum submitted by the British government will be discussed. The committee then held a closed meeting to discuss the procedure. There may be a secret meeting this afternoon. Mr. Gore, the Undersecretary of the British Colonial Office, will issue a declaration on behalf of the mandated government. (National News Agency Cable on the 30th)

[Geneva] The delegation of the Arab Higher Committee arrived here today and submitted a memorandum to the League of Nations Mandates Commission criticizing the British Royal Commission's report on Palestine, stating that this proposal is greatly inconsistent with the British obligations to the Arabs, and that the Jews can never be the masters of the land historically. According to Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, certain territories originally belonging to Turkey must be given independent autonomous governments when they reach a certain level of suitability. Therefore, the Arabs hereby make a request and ask for consideration of this issue. (News Agency Cable on the 30th)

### London Naval Treaty

British Formally Ratifies; Effective Immediately

[London] Because the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and India have all returned their instruments of ratification to the British Foreign Office, the Treaty on the Limitation of Naval Armaments and the Exchange of Information signed in London on March 25, 1936, will soon be implemented, as the United States and France had previously deposited their instruments of ratification. The limitations on naval armaments include: the maximum tonnage of battleships is 35,000 tons, and the caliber of the guns, if the countries of the Washington Naval Treaty sign this new treaty before April 1, 1937, is limited to 14 inches, otherwise it is limited to +6 inches. The maximum tonnage of aircraft carriers is 23,000 tons, and the caliber of the guns is 6.1 inches (if the guns installed on the carriers exceed 5.25 inches, the number exceeding the limit must not exceed ten). The tonnage of cruisers is 10,000 tons. Except for replacing old ships, new ships must not be built before January 1, 1934. Submarines are 2,000 tons, and the guns are 5.1 inches. There is no construction area for capital ships and aircraft carriers of 8,000 tons to 17,500 tons), and light surface ships must not be built or added before January 1, 1943. When rebuilding battleships, all existing modern battleships must not be equipped with guns exceeding the above limits. (Reuters from the Central News Agency on the 29th)

[London] Admiral Richmond, the former principal of the Imperial Defence College, delivered a speech at the Liberal Party's Cambridge Summer School this afternoon, discussing Japan's construction of larger battleships, saying, "We have lost some of our position in the Pacific, and we may have to take action in the future to maintain it, which is unfortunate." Japan's naval policy is not well-considered. According to historical experience, when one country builds larger battleships, other countries will follow suit. "Japan's military knowledge and experience are both commendable. It is strange that Japan wants to be on an equal footing with us by building larger battleships, because Japan's policy has failed more than once."

### Two Major Organizations of the British Air Force

Prime Minister States in the House of Commons

[London] Today, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons the government's decision on the future of the Naval Air Arm. Chamberlain said that the aircraft under consideration by the government are divided into two major categories: one is the aircraft loaded by the Royal Navy (commonly known as the Naval Air Arm. The dispatch and command of these aircraft belong to the Admiralty, but they are also part of the Royal Air Force, so their administrative command still belongs to the Air Ministry). The second category is the air force based on land that cooperates with the navy. The dispatch and administrative command of these aircraft belong to the Air Ministry. According to the plan under consideration by the government, the dispatch, administration and command of the first category of aircraft will all belong to the Admiralty, and all personnel will be naval personnel. However, the existing system for the second category of aircraft, including airships, will not be changed. In the future, the cooperation between the two major organizations will be closer, and the unresolved disputes can now come to an end. (Reuters from the Central News Agency on the 30th)

### Scorched Earth Resistance and the Public Security Maintenance Association

— Yong

The war in North China has progressed from local resistance to full-scale resistance. The heroic and indomitable 29th Army has sworn to die for the country. High-ranking officers have successively died in the Battle of Nanyuan. The news has spread, and the whole country is in grief. Although the situation in Peiping and Tianjin has changed suddenly, from the overall perspective, the temporary gain or loss of a city or town before the decisive battle is not related to the overall plan.

The so-called overall perspective, in military terms, is the formal decisive battle to determine the final victory or defeat. This concerns the command tent and cannot be discussed in detail. In terms of the country, Chiang Kai-shek, in addition to his previous declarations, made a more emphatic statement yesterday, saying that he would sacrifice to the end to defend the country, and even if he failed, he would be determined to perish with the country, and there would be no compromise or surrender. In other words, this is the so-called scorched earth resistance, and it is also the meaning of Wang Jingwei's Lushan speech, "a land of corpses and rubble, what use can the enemy get from it?" It is a thought that our people throughout the country should abide by and believe in together, and never forget it.

From this point of view, regardless of the gain or loss of a city or town, it is not related to the entire front line. Even if it fails to the point of scorched earth, we should not leave any material resources to the enemy. Only with the determination to sacrifice can we achieve the final victory. However, just as the troops in Peiping and Tianjin were beginning to move, local officials and gentry had already established organizations such as the Public Security Maintenance Association, falsely claiming to maintain local security, vainly hoping for temporary rights, betraying the policies of the country, and leaving a permanent stain on the nation. Their intentions are the same as appeasing the enemy, and are they not deserving of punishment?

Originally, organizations such as the Public Security Maintenance Association originated in the era of the Peking government. The Zhili-Anhui and Zhili-Feng wars were fought between chickens and insects. The two armies faced each other at the gate of the country. The elder statesmen suffered from the涂炭. Therefore, they weighed the situation of victory and defeat and decided on a strategy for handover. In the end, they were originally from the same root, why force each other so much? One side lined up with gongs and drums to welcome them, and the other side gradually withdrew their troops. This was to alleviate the impasse of replacing the prince with an extraordinary method. The opposing armies were only separated by a wall and were not related to the nation. Therefore, the accumulated habits continued, and a mediation practice was formed during the transfer of power.

However, after the September 18 Incident, the Japanese initially did not dare to carry out their plan of annexation and turned to seek out traitors. The traitors were willing to plot for glory and profit under their protection. However, when the enemy's power was not yet consolidated, they did not dare to publicly call them their father, so they falsely seized the good name of maintaining public security as a preliminary step in changing the psychology of the people, so that the people would only seek temporary security and would not ask about rule, and would only care about their current families and forget the position of the nation. They were free to advance and retreat, and if they succeeded, they would have the special merit of establishing a puppet state, and if they failed, they would use local security and non-involvement in politics as an excuse for evasion. They did not know that the so-called maintenance at that time was only a buffer for the transfer of power between two domestic regimes and could not be applied in the slightest to the invasion and coercion of foreign powers.

As for this war of resistance, the country has already firmly established its limits, and the authorities have repeatedly elaborated on it, "宁为焦土，决不妥协" ("Better to be scorched earth than to compromise.") However, under the policy of non-compromise, in the temporary gain and loss of a city or town, there were reckless people who started the old trick of Shenyang after the September 18 Incident, still using the concern for their families to lure the people and become the prelude to the transfer of power. This destruction of national policy and anesthetization of the people is even more serious than turning against the enemy. The losses suffered by the state from turning against the enemy are only limited to a small part of its subordinates, but this is to lead the millions of people in a city or town to ruin their spirit and sacrifice their material resources. During the war, every reduction of one point in our material resources is an increase of one point in the enemy's resources, and the ruin of our millions of people is even more related to the entire national war in countless ways. All our people, having embraced the determination to sacrifice for the country, should have a deep understanding of the Peiping and Tianjin Public Security Maintenance Associations and other organizations and apply strict sanctions so that the former capital and Tianjin will not repeat the mistakes of the initial organization in Shenyang.

### Negotiations Between Britain and Italy to Improve Relations

Rumors of Establishing Exchange Conditions; Eden Reportedly Visiting Italy in October

[Rome] Regarding the negotiations between Britain and Italy on the issue of Abyssinia and the maintenance of the status quo in the Mediterranean, the Italian government has recently sent a reply to Britain. The authorities have refused to explain the content, only saying that the improvement of relations between Britain and Italy has only just begun. It is also said that the foreign press has reported that British Foreign Secretary Eden will come to Italy to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini, but this is only speculation. (Havas Radio from the Central News Agency on the 29th)

[London] Regarding the talks between Italian Ambassador Grandi and Prime Minister Chamberlain, British informed sources believe that the two countries are about to establish an exchange condition, that is, Britain will recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, and Italy will change its attitude in the Mediterranean, especially in Spain. It is rumored that Chamberlain and Grandi will continue talks tomorrow here or at the Prime Minister's villa in Chequers. British political figures are quite in favor of the establishment of an exchange condition, but they believe that Britain's recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia may not be easily approved by public opinion. In short, the current situation in Abyssinia is ambiguous and unclear, and only the League of Nations can end it. (Central News Agency Cable on the 29th)

[London] After the talks between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Ambassador Grandi, the rumor that Foreign Secretary Eden will visit Rome has been spreading for a while. The "Daily Express" reported that this visit has indeed been considered and may take place around October. (National News Agency Cable on the 30th)

[Berlin] Political figures here are very pleased with the improvement of Anglo-Italian relations after the talks between Chamberlain and Grandi, because Germany has close relations with Italy, and also does not forget to establish good relations with Britain at any time. Therefore, it is believed here that the recent developments between Britain and Italy are a contribution to restoring universal faith in Europe. The "German Foreign Policy Review" reflects the views of the German Foreign Ministry, stating that the contact between Britain and Italy not only helps to solve today's problems, but also makes the principles of the Gentlemen's Agreement of January 2 complete and effective. It is hoped that this move will restore the general faith among the countries of Europe. (National News Agency Cable on the 29th)

### The Seventeenth International Geological Congress

Closed with Resolutions Passed, Next Session to be Held in London

[Moscow] The 17th International Geological Congress concluded here today, passing several resolutions, including: ⑴ establishing a standing committee on petrology, mineralogy, and geochemistry, with Soviet academician Levinsohn-Lessing elected as chairman; ⑵ establishing a standing committee to formally develop methods for calculating geological time using radiation techniques, with American scientist Loster elected as chairman; ⑶ approving the work of various subcommittees, including awarding the Spindia Tubev Prize to Soviet scientist Badulin; ⑷ the 18th Congress should be held in London in 1940.

Before the closing ceremony, chief delegates from various countries delivered speeches successively, expressing their gratitude to the Soviet government and scientific community for their hospitality, the perfection of the congress organization, and the tours arranged to various places. They also praised the excellent achievements and high standards of Soviet science, especially in geology. Finally, it was decided to send a telegram in the name of the congress to congratulate the Arctic winterers Bapapnin, Krenkel, Fedorov, and Schurshav. (TASS dispatch on the 29th)

### Scientific Report from the Arctic Station

▲TASS Moscow dispatch in July: Since the establishment of the Arctic station, the achievements of the scientific work carried out have been summarized by wireless by Che Papanin, Krenkel, Schurshav, and Fedorov, and are roughly as follows:

From May 21 to June 5, the ice floe on which the station was located drifted southwest, with the Greenwich meridian as the standard, at an average speed of four miles per day. From June 5, the ice floe changed to a zigzag flow, varying from east to west, generally between 88 degrees 30 minutes north latitude and 0 to 30 degrees west longitude.

The results of measuring the ocean water revealed that from the ocean surface to a depth of 150 meters, the water temperature was -1.63 to -1.7 degrees Celsius, with low salinity. The temperature then rose sharply, approaching zero degrees at 250 meters, and reaching a maximum of 0.71 to 0.78 degrees Celsius at a depth of 400 meters. Between 275 meters and 600 meters, the water temperature was above zero, with high salinity. Below 750 meters, the water temperature dropped back to below zero, with the ocean floor at -1.23 degrees Celsius. This indicates that the Atlantic current discovered by Nansen in the southern Arctic Ocean actually flows to the polar region, making the area relatively warmer.

At the same time, the results of the exploration proved that Nansen's speculation that there are very few organisms in the center of the Arctic Ocean was incorrect. The nets raised from a depth of 1,000 meters on the ocean floor were rich in various mollusks, echinoderms, jellyfish, and crustaceans. Arctic personnel also measured that the magnetic field there had an average force and no large anomalies. The magnetic meridian deviated 41 degrees west of the Greenwich meridian.

The results of gravity measurements showed a considerable difference from the normal distribution formula of ground gravity. This is quite meaningful and will be further explained after the entire record has been studied in detail.

### American Merchant Ship Near Baltimore Involved in Accident

Fifty People's Fate Unknown

Baltimore, USA. The steamship "Baltimore City," which runs between the ports of Baltimore and Norfolk, recently encountered an accident in Chesapeake Bay, fourteen miles from the port of Baltimore. Of the 150 passengers, it is reported that about 100 have been rescued, and the fate of the remaining 50 is unknown. After hearing the news, President Roosevelt immediately instructed the naval training ship "Annapolis" to sail to the scene of the accident to provide assistance. Also, when the ship caught fire, the battleship "Arkansas," which happened to be near the scene of the accident, immediately sent a wireless message stating that the "Baltimore City" had been completely burned down.

### Status of Overseas Chinese, Japanese Military, and Civilians Amidst the Fighting in Hebei

Martial Law Imposed in Japanese Concessions, Overseas Chinese Returning Home One After Another; Traitors Discovered Destroying Railways on the Canton-Hankou Railway

Hankou dispatch: Since the Japanese army successively attacked Lugouqiao and Langfang, the situation has become increasingly serious. Wuhan is the center of our country, guarding the endpoints of the two sections of the Pinghan Railway. The Japanese have established a concession, stationed consuls, and warships can come and go freely. Therefore, when the war broke out in the north, Wuhan was the first to be affected. Initially, Matsumoto, the Japanese vice-consul in Hankou, visited our government authorities, requesting effective protection of Japanese residents. Our government agreed to issue a general order to its subordinates, but the Japanese concession did not reduce its tense atmosphere. For example, police patrols were increased, naval landings were conducted, and air defense exercises were held continuously. On the roof of the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters in the concession, artillery positions were set up, and breakwaters and artillery positions were like forests on the riverbank. The electric nets and sandbags at the concession entrances were also prepared. Martial law was declared from the 28th, and warships were anchored on the river, including the flagship "Yaeyama," the "Toba," and the "Hotsu" destroyers, totaling three ships, with about 400 troops stationed. All were equipped with steel plates and heavy artillery, resembling wartime equipment. Commander Tanimoto Mataro was stationed on the flagship to command, and their movements were all visible.

When the Japanese army began to attack Lugouqiao, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed Japanese residents in Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Taiyuan, and Zhengzhou to return to their country. In addition to the Japanese residents in Beijing and Tianjin, the Japanese residents in Baoding, Taiyuan, and Zhengzhou have successively traveled south along the Pinghan Railway, passing through Hankou to Shanghai. Now that the situation is serious, Japanese residents from Wanzhou, Chongqing, Yichang, Shashi, and Changsha, cities upstream of the Yangtze River, are also gathering in Hankou one after another and will return to their country via Shanghai with the women and children of the overseas Chinese in Hankou. The young overseas Chinese in Hankou will all stay and prepare to form a 500-strong commando team to implement armed force when necessary. Under this extremely tense situation in the Japanese concession, Japanese Vice-Consul Matsumoto visited our authorities again on the 28th, reiterating his request for the protection of overseas Chinese. The Chinese people in the Japanese concession, regardless of being inspected and monitored by the Japanese, have moved out one after another. Hubei Province and Hankou City have successively established anti-enemy support associations, which were later merged into one for the convenience of work. Its constituent members include farmers' associations, labor unions, chambers of commerce, educational institutions, and news organizations. The association has telegraphed the central government, resolutely declaring war on Japan. Branches organized in various counties are also springing up like clouds. The Hankou Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations held a joint meeting yesterday and resolved four proposals: ⑴ to sever relations with the already determined list of enemy goods and sacrifice stipulations, and the Hankou Chamber of Commerce will organize a committee to promote domestic goods, and various industry associations will organize branches; ⑵ to notify manufacturers not to raise prices; ⑶ to publish and promote the names of domestic products in newspapers; ⑷ to stop unscrupulous merchants from profiting from them. In short, the current public security in Wuhan is as usual, but the entire line of the Pinghan Railway has been cut off for many days. Although full-line traffic was restored once, obstacles reappeared after only two days, and now it only goes to Changxindian. The railway bureau's losses have exceeded one million to date. On the Canton-Hankou Railway, it was discovered that someone had bought traitors to attempt sabotage. Xu Guoxing, the leader, has been captured in Yuezhou and sent to the Wuchang General Bureau for interrogation. Many accomplices escaped. The bureau has issued a general order to the entire line for strict prevention to ensure safety. (28th)

### Guangdong Province Strictly Prevents Traitor Activities

Preparing for Food Control During Extraordinary Times

Guangzhou dispatch: According to recent reports, the Japanese side has recently dispatched several ships to the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong to spy on the true strength of our defense forces and to buy traitors with heavy money in an attempt to sabotage transportation equipment. A few days ago, in the suburbs of Henan, Guangzhou, traitors intimidated bandits into cutting military telephone lines. Two people were captured and, after interrogation, confirmed to be correct. They were handed over by the Fourth Army Headquarters and sentenced to death. After this incident, it was reported near Humen that traitors had been discovered plotting illegal activities. Fortunately, the defense forces detected it and arrested several people. In Guangzhou City, it was also discovered that Japanese special agent organs in Shamian were buying traitors to infiltrate the city and carry out activities. It is also heard that traitors use all kinds of tricks to cover up the ears and eyes of the authorities, often renting rooms in hotels in the name of bidding for tax donations to set up offices and collect shares, but in fact, they are trying to spy on our secrets. Fortunately, it was discovered early. It is heard that several detectives went to a hotel on Xidi on the evening of the 27th and, after searching, arrested six suspects. They are currently being interrogated closely. In recent days, various institutions have been under de facto martial law. All people entering and exiting are paying attention to their actions and must wear badges to enter and exit. Air defense is especially strengthened. The authorities have sent personnel to the city for days to urge shops and residences to equip light shielding covers. Light control is also intensifying exercises. Air raid alarms are signaled by factory whistles and broadcast by police stations and city broadcasting stations to inform the city's people so that they know where to take refuge when enemy planes attack. Regarding food, the Food Regulation Association has recently drafted measures for food control during extraordinary times and submitted them to the provincial government for approval and implementation. On the one hand, in order to prevent the interruption of foreign rice imports, funds have been raised to purchase rice and stones from outside the province for transportation to Guangdong in order to store enough food for several months. On the other hand, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from smuggling exports, the effective period for restricting the export of grains from the province has been extended by six months. On the one hand, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating and hoarding, the authorities will formulate legal prices when necessary to restrict rice merchants from arbitrarily raising prices in order to maintain the people's food.

### Zhang Dingcheng's Department Implements Reorganization

Zhang et al. Declare the Abolition of the Red Army, Deadline for Concentration and Reorganization in August

Xiamen dispatch: The entire armed forces of the pseudo-Fujian Southwest Military and Political Committee, led by pseudo-chairman Zhang Dingcheng and vice-chairman Deng Zihui, sent Xie Yucai to surrender to the 469th Brigade of the 157th Division stationed in Longyan. After several contacts, Zhang Ce'an, the administrative commissioner of the sixth district, and Lian Tisheng, the brigade commander of the 469th Brigade, negotiated and proposed four preconditions: ⑴ Zhang Dingcheng and Deng Zihui must come to Yan to discuss in person, with at least one person coming; ⑵ after the reorganization, it is guaranteed that there will be no residual troops or organizational activities in the ten counties of western Fujian; ⑶ party activities will be stopped immediately; ⑷ after the reorganization and review, a public declaration should be issued to express their attitude and stance. Zhang Ce'an then telegraphed the provincial government on the 23rd to request permission for the reorganization, and Xie also reported back on the 24th. On the 26th, Zhang received a reply telegram from Chen Yi, the chairman of the provincial government, and Zhao Nan, the director of the security department, approving it and instructing Zhang to handle it carefully. Zhang then discussed with Brigade Commander Lian and decided that the brigade headquarters would still be responsible for the matter of review and training. The provincial government would be responsible for the salaries after the reorganization. On the 28th, Deng Zihui and Xie Yucun arrived in Longyan. Li Weifu, the chairman of the county chamber of commerce, and Guo Rongqi, the director of the finance committee, accompanied them to visit Zhang Lian. They will stay in Yan for several days. Zhang Deng's troops will use Dahekeng in Shanghang, Chizhai in Yongding, Zhuziba in Yan'nan Zhang, and Keling in Nanjing, designated by the 157th Division, as preliminary concentration points, and another three places, Baisha in Longyan, Xiayang in Yongding, and Luxi in Pinghe, as review points. There are about 400 people to be reviewed in Longyan and more than 600 people in Yongding. The period for concentration and reorganization is limited to the end of August. Xiayang and Luxi are scheduled for August 22 as the date for the completion of concentration and reorganization, and Baisha for August 26. Short-term training will begin on September 1. A village within 30 miles of the Zhanglong Highway will be selected as the training location. Afterwards, the provincial government will pay salaries by name. The rations during the review period and the dismissal fees for the non-armed pseudo-workers of the department after the review will require a budget of 14,000 yuan. In addition to 6,000 yuan shared by the governments of the sixth district under the order of the special commissioner, the remaining 8,000 yuan will be raised through donations from the people of western Fujian and overseas compatriots. Special Commissioner Zhang, Li Weifu, Guo Rongqi, etc. will raise funds from Zhangxia separately. In addition, Zhang Dingcheng and others issued a declaration in the name of the pseudo-Fujian Southwest Military and Political Committee, abolishing the name of the Red Army and obeying the command of the military authorities under the central government, and proposed six points, the important ones are as follows: ⑴ Stop the suppression and abolish the blockade of the bandit areas; ⑵ All Red Army in southwest Fujian will unanimously cancel their original numbers and wait for the government to reorganize; ⑶ Voluntarily give up the Soviet land revolution armed riot policy, cancel the organization of military committees at all levels, and obey national laws; ⑷ Request the military and political authorities to return the weapons of He Peng and Wu Jin's troops and restore their organization. According to senior officers of the 157th Division, after He and Wu's troops were incorporated, there were still various unstable rumors in the society. In order to express their intentions, He and Wu voluntarily requested to hand over their weapons to show their sincerity. Now He and Wu have been appointed as lieutenants in the division by the division headquarters, and all soldiers are still concentrated for training, led by He and Wu. As for Zhang Min and other 12 people who were executed in Zhao'an, they are another group of scattered bandits and not under He and Wu. (30th)

### Opium King Ye Qinghe Reported to Have Been Executed by Firing Squad

It is Reported that Cheng Yunshan Has Also Been Executed

Xiamen dispatch: Opium King Ye Qinghe was escorted from Fuzhou to Hankou on the 13th of this month. After repeated interrogations by the military judge of the Anti-Smoking Headquarters, it was determined that the evidence of Ye's crimes of privately trafficking drugs and endangering the Republic of China was conclusive. Therefore, there have been rumors that he has been sentenced to death a few days ago, and it has also been reported that the accomplice Cheng Yunshan has also been executed, but neither has been confirmed. Until the day before yesterday, news suddenly came from Ye's relatives and friends that Ye had indeed been executed by firing squad in Hankou on the 19th, and the Ye family had already selected a cemetery in Xiamen and would try to transport the coffin back to Xiamen for burial. Whether this is true remains to be verified. However, this news was indeed released by people who are very close to the Ye family. If it is not true, then there is another purpose. (July 30)

Results of the Appeal for Exemption from Donations

Previously, all public groups in this county appealed to the Yuan Department and the provincial offices, arguing that the county government would levy a house donation, but the people's strength was not enough, and they sought exemption to relieve the people's hardship.

The Business Tax Bureau of this county previously ordered the collection of a temporary business tax on wheat, ordering various flour mills and wheat shops to collect it from wheat merchants on their behalf. If they do not collect it on their behalf, they will stop issuing tax-free passports. Maoxin Jiufeng and other flour mills in the county expressed their opposition, because the factories have already paid a unified tax, and the raw material wheat is exempt from tax. Now the business tax bureau is ordering collection in this way, which is a violation of laws and regulations. They have jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting that it be stopped and requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department be ordered to avoid withholding tax-free passports.

Except for He Baoquan, who was sentenced to three years and six months and gave up his appeal, the rest of the defendants appealed to the High Court. After the trial, each was reduced to one year and eight months. The defendants refused to accept the sentence again and hired lawyers Gu Shaojun and Zhou Jia to appeal to the Supreme Court.

He has reported the situation to the county government for relief.

### Taizhou

Dishonest Merchants Transporting Grain for Export

Huangyan, Huling, and Linhai counties, located on the coast with numerous harbors and convenient for naval vessels, have seen frequent occurrences of smuggling. Generally, unscrupulous merchants, solely for their own profit, purchase wheat and transport it for export, reportedly to be used as chemical fertilizer for fields, for sales inland. With the new harvest recently hitting the market, these merchants are once again actively engaging in these practices. If border defense measures are not taken, a continuous stream of exports is feared, impacting the food supply for the people, a matter of great importance.

Frequent Robberies in Rural Villages

Since the disbandment of local defense units in the villages around Huling, robberies and kidnappings by bandits have become frequent. In Xialiang, a village bordering Huangyan, a fisherman named Zhu Tiangui was kidnapped by bandits around 1:00 AM on the 15th. Furthermore, near the foot of Tiger Head Mountain, on the evening of the 24th, a dishonest merchant privately transporting fertilizer was intercepted and robbed by bandits, who seized several tens of national currency from the merchant. Additionally, a shop owner in Simusha village was also kidnapped by bandits.

### Cixi

Negotiated Early Rice Rent

The early rice harvest in various villages southwest of Cixi has been affected by rainstorms this year, resulting in varying yields. To prevent disputes among tenant farmers, the county government dispatched officials to meet with local gentry and both landlords and tenants to assess the rice harvest and negotiate rent amounts. It was decided that for every mu (unit of land) yielding less than 100 catties (unit of weight), 30 catties would be paid as rent. For yields below 30%, rent would be waived according to provincial regulations. For remaining yields, the old rent amount would be halved, with an additional 25% reduction, to be paid at 86% or 76% of the reduced amount.

### Xiaoshan

Unresolved Handover by Former County Magistrate

### All North China Sea Routes Blocked, Foreign Merchant Ships Suspend Service to Tianjin and Dagu

Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Vessels All Diverted to South China Routes

Since the Japanese military provoked conflict in Tianjin, ships entering and leaving Dagu have been greatly impacted by Japanese artillery fire. North China shipping routes have been completely severed since yesterday. Not only are Chinese ships unable to travel, but foreign ships have also officially announced the suspension of services due to the war. Thus, all maritime transport in North China has been fundamentally blocked. Details are as follows:

Sea Lanes Cut Off

Various Chinese and foreign shipping companies in this port have received telegrams from Tianjin, generally stating that fierce fighting began in Tianjin on the 18th and has been extremely intense. The Japanese navy, due to the obstruction of the Ninth Route Army firing upon Japanese ships carrying military supplies entering the port, fired artillery at Dagu, causing the port of Tianjin to also suffer from artillery fire, completely cutting off sea lanes. North China sea routes have been essentially blockaded.

Foreign Ships Suspend Service

Chinese ships have suspended service to Tianjin for half a month, only able to sail to Yantai and Weihaiwei. However, foreign ships of Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, and others, protected by warships, were still able to operate as usual. Recently, the Customs Office in Shanghai has permitted the export of 80,000 bags of flour destined for North China. While foreign ships, especially British ships, had a competitive advantage on the Shanghai-Tianjin route, they received telegrams from Tianjin stating that artillery fire was intense at Dagu and other places, making it impossible for ships to enter Tanggu. Therefore, yesterday, foreign merchants such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire decided to immediately suspend North China shipping routes. The regularly scheduled ships "Dingsheng" (Jardine Matheson) and "Hunan" (Butterfield & Swire), originally scheduled to depart for Tianjin tomorrow, have been rerouted to the South China routes to Shantou and Guangzhou starting August 1st. However, Yantai and Weihaiwei, being major summer retreats for large contingents of the British and American navies, can still be accessed. The Butterfield & Swire ship "Shuntian," scheduled for the 2nd, will be rerouted to Yantai and Weihaiwei.

Freight Charges Paid in Cash

Six Chinese and foreign shipping companies operating on the coastal routes (namely, China Merchants, Sanpei, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Kailuan, and Nissin) have convened a meeting due to the outbreak of war in North China, fearing prolonged conflict. For cargo shipped from Shanghai to Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, Longkou, Niuzhuang (the Tianjin route is severed), and other places within the North China line, freight charges will no longer be billed to accounts but will be collected in cash. However, bank drafts or negotiable instruments with a maturity of no more than five days may be accepted. This measure will be implemented starting with ships clearing customs on July 30th and has already been announced to all consignors.

### 28,000 Japanese Nationals from Various Locations Return Home

Over 600 Return Home Yesterday; Reserve Soldiers Stationed in Rural Areas Recalled to Tokyo

Japanese Nationals in the Yangtze River Region Return Home via Shanghai

When the Japanese mail ship "Shanghai Maru" set sail from the wharf yesterday, it carried 631 Japanese nationals returning home, the largest group since the Lugouqiao Incident. They were accompanied and cared for by Iwai Kanjiro, a commercial attache from the Japanese consulate, who was dispatched by the Japanese government to Shanghai on the ship the day before specifically to handle this matter. The Japanese nationals returning home this time were those who had gathered in Shanghai from Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and other ports in recent days. Sixty-six people were from Shanghai. The breakdown is as follows: Hankou 101, Jiujiang 87, Chongqing 1, Anqing 97, Nanjing 19, Shanghai 66, Hangzhou 3, Suzhou 27, and over 100 from other ports. The third group of 57 people from Hankou arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese mail ship "Fengyang Maru," disembarked at the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road, and were accommodated in Japanese-owned hotels in Hongkou. They are scheduled to return home on the "Nagasaki Maru" on August 1st. Sixteen Japanese nationals residing in Zhejiang Province arrived in Shanghai by train from Hangzhou at 6:35 PM yesterday and will transfer to return home. The second group of 29 people from Chongqing also departed from Hankou on the "Ruiyang Maru" and will arrive in Shanghai in three days. The second group of over 30 people from Jiujiang and the first group of 16 from Jiaohu are expected to arrive today and will return home on the "Ryuta Maru" and "Shanghai Maru" departing on the 3rd and 5th, respectively. According to unofficial statistics, since the Lugouqiao Incident, the total number of Japanese nationals evacuated to Japan, including those from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, Taiyuan, and Suibian, is approximately 28,000.

Reserve Soldiers Recalled in Batches

Over 300 Japanese reserve soldiers stationed in Shanghai were ordered yesterday by the Japanese Naval Landing Forces in Shanghai to return to Tokyo, Japan. According to the East Asia News Agency, these individuals are mostly Japanese residents in the Shanghai small business community, many with families. The Japanese government's recall of these individuals is reportedly due to the repeated dispatch of standing army troops to China, leaving the home front severely depleted. Therefore, reserve soldiers are being recalled to maintain the home front. The first group of reserve soldiers, including Kino Mitsusawa and others, departed for Japan on the Japanese mail ship "Shanghai Maru" yesterday morning.

### Full Mobilization After War Begins;

Roads Association and Others Raise Funds to Purchase Vehicles; Jianghai Customs Prohibits Export of Wheat and Rice

Since the outbreak of the war in North China, the Japanese military has been pressing our forces from multiple directions with naval, land, and air forces in the suburbs of Beijing, Tianjin, Tanggu, and other places. Our troops are fighting valiantly, and the tragic intensity of the resistance is shaking the entire country. All institutions, organizations, and people from all walks of life in Shanghai are filled with righteous indignation and have successively risen up to engage in support efforts. The National Roads Association and others will launch a fundraising campaign to purchase vehicles to transport supplies and food to the front lines. The Jianghai Customs Office has been ordered to prohibit the export of wheat and rice from yesterday onwards to ensure sufficient stockpiles of food for the people. Details are as follows:

Roads Association Raises Funds to Purchase Vehicles

The National Roads Association, recognizing that the soldiers at the front lines are fighting bravely and defending the country, and that there is a great need for vehicles to transport supplies, food, and provide relief, has joined forces with the Shanghai Charitable Organizations' Joint Relief Association, the Chinese Red Cross Society, and others to launch a fundraising campaign to purchase vehicles. Zhao Puqing, Yan Fuqing, Qian Xinzhi, Lou Zhaonian, and representatives from various automobile companies, including Smith, Miles, Zoulantmen, Crowe, and Dai Yousan, have been appointed as members of the vehicle purchase committee. The vehicle purchase methods have been determined: (1) Vehicles will be purchased from various companies, and a special discount will be negotiated based on the list price. (2) The Roads Association will list the brand, price, actual sales price, and special discount of vehicles sold by each company, indicating the donation number for reference. (3) All vehicles will be delivered to the Chinese Red Cross Society for use in rescuing wounded soldiers and transporting food, and will not be used for other purposes. (4) A detailed plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance to request exemption from import duties for these vehicles. The committee members are actively working on the plan. It is reported that more than a dozen vehicles have been ordered from the United States and will arrive in Shanghai soon.

Jianghai Customs Prohibits Export of Wheat and Rice

After the outbreak of war, ensuring a sufficient stockpile of domestic food is of utmost importance. The Jianghai Customs Office has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to prohibit the export of all wheat and rice (including mixtures containing wheat) from yesterday onwards, following the same measures as the ban on wheat exports (including those already ordered but not yet shipped), to foreign countries, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Dalian, to prevent them from benefiting the enemy. The customs office also earnestly advises all merchants in the city to exercise caution and self-restraint.

Measures for Collecting Scrap Metal

The First Special District Citizens' Association of Shanghai has established a draft for the collection of scrap metal to contribute to the nation: (1) The purpose of this association is to collect scrap metal, contribute to the nation, and strengthen the power of resistance. (2) To facilitate citizens' contribution of scrap metal in their neighborhoods, the association has sent letters to the Second Special District, the Shanghai South District, the Shanghai North District, and the sub-districts affiliated with the association for collection. (3) The association has a registration book that lists the "name" of the contributor, "name of item," and "quantity" for recording purposes. The association will then compile and announce the information. (4) Citizens who submit scrap metal will be given a receipt by the collection point, indicating the quantity. (5) Each collection group should appoint a custodian committee to be responsible for the safekeeping of the citizens' contributed scrap metal and report the quantity to the association every two weeks. (6) When a considerable quantity of scrap metal has been collected, the association will submit it to the Anti-Aggression Support Association or the municipal authorities. (7) Citizens who make particularly outstanding contributions of scrap metal will be commended by the association or by the government.

Promoting the Fundraising of National Salvation Funds

The various circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Support Association, in view of the opening of the North China War and the urgent need for relief for the military and civilians, decided to hold a fundraising committee group meeting at 4:00 PM today to discuss and promote fundraising for national salvation donations. Various promotional measures have been drafted for discussion. The First Special District Citizens' Association, recognizing the severity of the national crisis, has launched the "One Yuan National Salvation Savings" campaign to awaken the nation's long-term resistance. The method is for each person to save one yuan per month directly into a bank account until lost territory is recovered. The use of these savings will be determined by the highest military authorities for national salvation, and citizens will have the right to oversee their use. If this can be done, with a population of 3.7 million in Shanghai, if one million people engage in savings, then one million yuan can be obtained each month for national salvation. By accumulating small amounts, it will certainly be possible to strengthen national power to achieve the purpose of saving the country.

All of our countrymen should unite in hatred of the enemy and rise up to face the national crisis together. At the ninth executive committee meeting, it was resolved that all members and employees should unanimously donate to serve the country. We hereby request that your members investigate and act accordingly, actively donating cash and relief supplies to be collected and forwarded to the front lines to boost morale and fulfill our duty as citizens."

The request has been approved. This is hereby announced."

### Glimpses of the Disruption of Traffic Between Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin

Due to the chaotic situation in North China, various modes of transportation between Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin have been disrupted. The New News Agency reporter obtained the following information from transportation authorities yesterday: (1) Aviation: The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beijing route north has been temporarily limited to Qingdao. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's route from Shanghai north is only flying to Taiyuan. (2) Shanghai-Beijing Train: Although Tianjin is still the terminal station, whether it can be reached depends on the situation. (3) Telegram: According to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, all wired and wireless telegrams from Shanghai to Beijing have been interrupted. The wireless communication from Shanghai to Tianjin is only through wireless telegram, and wired and submarine cables have also been cut. (4) Mail: The Shanghai Postal Administration stated that mail to Beijing and Tianjin is still being accepted and transported as usual. Airmail depends on whether the airline's planes are operating. Large parcels have not been ordered to stop being accepted, but in reality, there are very few senders. If the situation worsens further, traffic between Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin will likely be temporarily interrupted.

### Chinese Employees of Japanese Trading Firms Resign En Masse

Over 100 Have Resigned Recently; Rickshaw Pullers Also Unwilling to Pull Japanese

Since the Japanese military provoked incidents in North China without cause, all of our citizens are filled with righteous indignation and united in hatred of the enemy. The call for resisting aggression and saving the country has filled the entire country. Chinese employees of Japanese trading firms in Shanghai and domestic servants in Japanese homes have resigned en masse, believing that serving the Japanese is tantamount to being an accomplice to the enemy given the severity of the national crisis. In recent days, over 100 people have resigned from serving the Japanese. The Japanese side has been greatly alarmed and has offered to increase wages, but the employees and servants have resolutely rejected the monetary temptation and resigned decisively. It is reported that a large number of employees are planning to resign from Japanese firms in the coming days. Therefore, Japanese shops, except for those that have already employed Japanese employees, are planning to hire White Russians as replacements. Huang Ayun, a rickshaw puller who voluntarily resigned, told the Shenzhou News Agency reporter that he had been serving the Japanese for 20 years. The Japanese's treatment was not bad, and his family was able to make a living. However, since the North China Incident, he felt indignant and felt guilty in his conscience if he continued to pull rickshaws for the enemy. Therefore, he resolutely resigned. The Japanese initially thought he had another job and offered to increase his salary. At that time, he frankly told the Japanese his true intentions for resigning. The Japanese also expressed regret.

### The Elimination of Smuggling in This City

Since the outbreak of the war in Beiping and Tianjin, the Customs authorities in this city have been extremely concerned about the safety and work situation of customs officers in those two areas. Yesterday, they received a reply telegram stating that before the war broke out in Tianjin, local Japanese ruffians acted recklessly and were practically impossible to work with. The Japanese military, because our customs officers were still serving loyally and diligently, were extremely hostile to the anti-smuggling personnel. Therefore, the customs officers worked at great risk. After the war broke out, their work was forced to stop, and all customs officers have been concentrated in safe zones, awaiting orders. Yesterday, the local Customs authorities in this port stated that they would not withdraw customs officers from that area unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, they have telegraphed the responsible persons of the local customs offices, instructing them to continue working as usual for the time being and not to withdraw. As for this city, the trend of smuggling has disappeared. Recently, no smuggled goods have been seized in either imports or exports. The reason for the cessation is probably due to the situation in this city, as the authorities have reassigned all the ruffians, thus temporarily suppressing the smuggling trend.

### Japanese Marines Parade Vehicles Busily

More than a hundred people for two hours

Around 5 PM the day before yesterday, the Japanese Marines stationed in Shanghai gathered at the front of the headquarters on Jiangwan Road with over ten motorcycles, eight or nine armored vehicles, and one tank, and set off for a parade. Some went east, turning onto Ouyang Road, while others went south towards North Sichuan Road. Other areas such as Tongji Road and Jiangwan Road in the urban area were also frequently patrolled by Japanese military vehicles.

The sizes of these short shirts and pants should be large. Each set costs about one yuan and ten cents. We hope that all circles will donate and send them directly to the Red Cross on Haig Road. The association is also willing to provide guidance on cutting and sewing methods. Donations of clothing and money are both welcome. (2) Recently, many people have inquired with the association about how to purchase gas masks. According to the association's investigation, most of the gas masks sold on the market do not meet the standards. The Military Administration Department has several mask factories, and their products are of excellent quality. However, whether they are sufficient for military use and whether there are enough to sell to civilians is currently being requested from the Military Administration Department.

### Japanese Disturb Finance, Counterfeiting Our Legal Tender

Counterfeit Money Machine and Copper Plates Seized; Heinous Chinese Also Participated

Lu Liankui, the Chinese Inspector of the Detective Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Detectives Liu Shaokui, Zhu Shouling, and Western Detective Bei Qing, learned that several heinous Chinese people colluded with Japanese to print our country's legal tender and use it in society to disrupt finance, which was extremely abominable. Therefore, they conducted a strict investigation. After contacting various parties for several days, they solved the case. A total of eight people were arrested, including Japanese Hida Kiho, Torita Masatsugu, Ishii Nobuyoshi, Minesan Gibee, Yoko San, Koreans Yang Yu, Yang Gongchen, Yang Jinzhang, and eight Chinese, including Liu Bin from Tianjin, Zhou Pingji from Henan, Yang Jingxian from Songjiang, Mrs. Zhou Yang from Shanghai, Zhao Shusheng from Anhui, and Kang Diqing from Jiaxing. Four hundred counterfeit five-yuan notes of the Bank of China, machines, copper plates, and six copper plates for printing counterfeit Guangdong Provincial Bank notes were seized. The Japanese and Korean criminals were handed over to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation, while the Chinese criminals were sent to Special Court No. 1, requesting permission to detain them on file. At that time, because the police were strictly investigating the case, the court ordered that it be temporarily prohibited from being published. Now that the police investigation work has come to an end, the details of the process are recorded below.

When the Western and Chinese detectives learned of the counterfeit legal tender act, they immediately launched an investigation. They learned that Hida Kiho was in charge. Then the detectives secretly arranged for Detective Zhu Shouling to open Room 511 at the Hua'an Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road on the 19th of the month, and the other detectives secretly arranged for a few detectives in the neighboring Room 513 to wait for the right moment to arrest them. Detective Zhu also notified the tea waiter that if I called for Coca-Cola, he would quickly notify the detectives in Room 513 to come. After the arrangement was properly arranged, the detectives induced Hida Kiho to Room 511 of Hua'an. Detective Zhu falsely claimed to be the owner of a shipping company and was planning to purchase 20,000 yuan of counterfeit legal tender to be transported to Tianjin. At that time, they agreed to exchange 30 yuan of real money for 100 yuan of counterfeit money, and Hida agreed to do it, and invited Detective Zhu to take the goods to his home at No. 610 Wusong Road at 3 pm. When the time came, Zhu responded to the appointment and left, but Zhu had to pay 20,000 yuan at a time. However, Hida's intention was to deliver in batches, which resulted in nothing. The next day, Hida invited Torita Masatsugu to go to Hua'an to meet Zhu. Then he led Zhu to see Ishii Nobuyoshi at No. 23, Lane 142, Xihua Road. Liu Bin and Zhou Yuji were also present. Liu took out a five-yuan note from the Bank of China, and Ishii took out a bundle of paper for printing counterfeit notes, indicating that counterfeiting was extremely easy. Then they discussed the issue of the delivery location. Detective Zhu insisted on delivering the goods at Yeya.

However, the Japanese side refused, and the negotiations failed again. On the 21st, Hida, Torita, and Liu Bin went to Hua'an again to negotiate with Detective Zhu. At 10:10 am on the 22nd, Hida, Torita, Ishii, Minesan Gibee, and Liu Bin all went to Room 511 of Hua'an. Detective Zhu knew that they must have brought counterfeit money this time, so he called the tea waiter to bring "Coca-Cola." The tea waiter went to Room 513 to notify the detectives, and the detectives rushed in and arrested all five people. Four hundred counterfeit five-yuan notes of the Bank of China, totaling 2,000 yuan, were seized from Liu Bin's side and taken back to the police station. A printing machine, three bundles of bell tickets, one copper plate, one five-yuan counterfeit note from the Bank of China, one ten-yuan counterfeit note from the Central Bank, a bundle of letters, a code book, and more than ten smuggling vests were seized at Ishii's home at No. 23, Lane 142, Xihua Road. These vests were used to hide smuggled goods during the smuggling boom. When the police were searching, Zhou Yuqing was also present, so he was arrested. Later, six copper plates of counterfeit Guangdong Provincial Bank notes and a basket of machine parts were seized at Minesan's home somewhere on Zhapu Road. According to Ishii, Deng Ciqian and Chen Yan, Zhao Shusheng, etc., who were related to Deng Tianfu Silver Building at No. 171, Hong Kong Avenue, jointly invested 10,000 yuan in the 25th year of the Republic of China to set up a secret agency specializing in counterfeiting banknotes, stamps and mail. Recently, a large number of one-yuan counterfeit notes from Guangdong Provincial Bank were printed. Chen Yan carried it to Guangdong and other places. According to the confession of the criminals, the police went to No. 19 Huashun Lane, Tongfu Road, and arrested Jin Diqing. They also arrested Zhao Shusheng at No. 15 in the same lane. It was found that Zhao was involved in smuggling and counterfeiting banknotes with various Japanese people. A letter related to smuggling was seized at his home and taken back to the police station. Later, Yang Jingxian and his mistress Zhou Yang were arrested at No. 25 Hualong Road. Then, a paper cutting machine was seized at No. 94 Huayu Road. Then, Yokozan and three Koreans were arrested. Yesterday morning, the police sent five Chinese including Liu Bin to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Special Court No. 1. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi said that the police were organizing and searching for various evidences in this case, so it was difficult to file a public prosecution at this time, so he requested permission to extend the detention, because there were many witnesses and physical evidences in this case, so please specially order the trial, and so on. Feng Shide, the judge of the court, reviewed it and approved Liu Bin's extension of detention and waited for the scheduled trial.

### Lawyer Sentenced to One Year for Forging Documents

Guo Diaomei Unconvinced; Preparing to Appeal

Guo Diaomei, a lawyer from Fujian, and Wang Ziying from Chongming, the director of the Telecommunications Training Institute at No. 80, Jinshenfu Road, Jin Gu Village, were involved in a lawsuit over Guo Diaomei's forgery of documents. The police sent Guo to the Special Court No. 2 and filed a public prosecution. Judge Chen Shuoying repeatedly held court sessions to study the case and ordered Guo to pay a bail of 2,000 yuan. Because he had no bail, he was detained. The case has now been tried and concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen came to the Criminal Court No. 1 to pronounce the judgment. Guo Diaomei was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for forging documents and one year of deprivation of civil rights. After the judgment, Guo was still returned to the detention center. Guo said after the judgment that he was unconvinced and prepared to file an appeal.

### Tragic Collision of Two Fish Trucks

Twelve People Injured

Near Xipu Road, Yangshupu, Pudong, at about 4 AM yesterday morning, a fish transport truck with license number 16970 from the Xielong Motor Company, loaded with fresh fish and fishmongers from Xinxing, drove to the fish market. A fish truck from the Datong Company was fully loaded with goods and fishmongers from the fish market and drove towards it. At that time, the driver of the Datong Company's truck turned on the lights so brightly that the driver of the Xielong truck was dazzled and could not distinguish clearly for a while. The two cars moved into the same route, resulting in a violent collision. In addition to the damage to the two cars, all the fishmongers on the two cars were thrown out. There were as many as twelve injured people. The nearby police heard the news and rushed to the scene, copied down the numbers of the two cars, and reported them to the police station for investigation. At the same time, an ambulance was called for the injured and sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Among them, Shen Zaizhi from Suzhou, 37 years old, Yao Guicheng from Tianjin, 33 years old, and Jin Changchun from Shaoxing, 46 years old, were seriously injured and hospitalized. The remaining nine people were fortunate to have minor injuries, so the hospital bandaged them and discharged them.

### Rumors of Change in the Presidents of the Local Courts

### Assassin of Tang Youren Appealed, Still Sentenced to Death

No Sufficient Reasons or Concrete Rebuttals; Two Criminals Smiled Bitterly Upon Hearing the Verdict and Were Returned to the Detention Center

Liu Zhennan from Hubei and Qiu Jiyu from Shaoxing, the criminals in the case of the assassination of Tang Youren from Hunan, the former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the evening of December 25, 1935, were taken to the Special Court No. 2 by the French police in early winter last year. The Legal Police Department filed a full prosecution for murder. The initial trial resulted in Liu Zhennan and Qiu Jiyu being sentenced to death for jointly committing murder as repeat offenders and deprived of their civil rights indefinitely. The two criminals were not convinced and appealed to the High Court No. 3. They claimed that they did not participate in the assassination, that they were forced to confess by the Public Security Bureau and the police, and that the cartridge cases and bullets found at the scene of the body did not match the current pistol. The collegial panel of the High Court No. 3 concluded the trial a few days ago and scheduled the announcement of the verdict, which has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Wu Tingqi, the presiding judge of the criminal court, and Judges Chen Daqi and Wang Yue came to the third court and ordered Liu and Qiu to be brought to court to announce the verdict, rejecting the appeal. They briefly explained the reasons for the verdict to the two criminals, saying that the court reviewed their appeals and found that there were no sufficient reasons or concrete rebuttals. The original trial's sentence of death for the two was not inappropriate, so the court rejected the appeal. If they did not agree with the verdict, they could submit a written statement to the court within ten days of receiving the judgment and appeal to the Supreme Court. During the appeal period, they would still be returned to the detention center. When Liu and Qiu heard that the appeal was rejected and they were still sentenced to death, they showed bitter smiles, remained silent, and were taken down by the bailiffs and sent back to the detention center.

### Li Amao and Son Accused of Occupying Three Mu of Land

Defense Claims Family Property Dispute Should Not Involve Criminal Matters

Li Amao, a local resident of No. 6 Nantangbang, Xietu Road, is 62 years old. His cousin, Li Jinxiang, owns five mu of land under the names of Li Hanzhang and Li Yuzhang, located at No. 14 Tu (now No. 6 Tu), Zhengzhen Road, in this county. In the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Li Jinxiang suffered from epilepsy and was bedridden. He entrusted Li Amao and his son, Li Gengquan, to exchange the five original land deeds for land ownership certificates at the Land Bureau. Several years passed, and only two deeds were returned. The remaining three mu of land, consisting of three plots of land numbered 13, 17, and 18 at No. 21, Zhezhiwei, No. 6 Tu, along with the three original deeds, were sold by Li Amao and his son to Xie Laiqing on September 7, 1935, for the price of 1,500 yuan. The transfer of ownership was registered with the Real Estate Registry of the District Court. Recently, Li Jinxiang discovered this and filed a lawsuit with the District Court. The prosecutor opened a court investigation. Li Gengquan avoided appearing in court, while Li Amao was detained and prosecuted for embezzlement. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Wang Shanxiang. The plaintiff's lawyer, Yan Lu Zhongqi, filed a civil suit requesting a judgment for the return of the land. The defendant's lawyer, Jiang Chiping, argued that the defendant claimed that the three plots of land, 13, 17, and 18, belonged to the defendant and could naturally be sold. The plaintiff only entrusted the defendant with one land deed, not five. Furthermore, the plaintiff once testified that plots 13 and 18 belonged to Li Amao, which proves the inconsistency of the plaintiff's claims. In addition, the land is jointly owned by Li Jinxiang, Li Fugeng, and Li Yinxiang, and only Li Jinxiang is suing, which is procedurally incorrect. Furthermore, this is purely a family property dispute, which falls within the scope of civil matters and should not involve criminal law. The court adjourned the hearing to summon Li Jinxiang's mother and other family members to testify and question them further. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Xiang Sheng Motors Deceived by Bandits Yesterday

Hired a Car from Huade Road, Then Drove the Driver off at Dengtuo Road

Yesterday evening at approximately 9:45 PM, the Beijing Road branch of Xiang Sheng Motors received a phone call requesting a car to wait at a location on Huade Road for a trip to the fish market. The company notified its Huade Road station, which dispatched car No. 18413, driven by a driver named Shen Youlan (from Shandong Province). Upon arriving at the destination, two passengers immediately boarded the car and ordered the driver to drive straight ahead. After traveling about half a mile, two men standing on the side of the road signaled the car to stop. Shen Youlan stopped the engine and opened the door, and the two men also boarded the car, sitting next to the driver. One of them then pulled out a pistol and ordered him to remain silent. Shen was immediately stunned. One of the bandits took over driving and turned back towards Dengtuo Road near East and West Huade Road, where they forced the driver out of the car and drove straight ahead. Afterwards, the driver returned to a nearby police station to report the incident. As of midnight, the car had not been found, and the police were investigating.

Commentary

### Our Demands

— Shen Jiaqian

The news of the recovery of Fengtai and Langfang only excited people for a day, followed by regret the next day. Now, due to the "defection" of traitors, the situation has "drastically changed," and Tianjin has fallen into enemy hands after a bitter fight, following the example of Peiping. Victory or defeat is common in war. The loss of Peiping and Tianjin was within expectations, so "temporary setbacks in domestic affairs should not be considered failures, and the battles of Peiping and Tianjin cannot be considered over." As long as there is a day for a counterattack, as long as the war of resistance continues to the end, why worry that the Blue Sky White Sun flag will not fly over Peiping and Tianjin, or even over the peaks of Changbai Mountain!

However, even today, after the loss of Peiping and Tianjin, I cannot help but look back with a heavy heart. Chairman Chiang said, "It must be understood that the transformation of the situation in Peiping and Tianjin today was foreseen by insightful people in the country long ago. The aggression and oppression of Japanese military and political forces has been going on for a long time. Therefore, the creation of today's situation is by no means accidental and can serve as a good reference for us."

Yes, the past is gone, and the future can be pursued. "The battles of Peiping and Tianjin today are only the beginning of their war of aggression, and certainly not the end of the war." Therefore, for the loss of Peiping and Tianjin, and the death of soldiers defending the country, we can only end it with a heavy heart, accept its lessons, and unite the country as one to save the nation from danger and reach the other shore of victory. However, precisely to ensure the guarantee of victory, we must severely punish the traitors who sell out national interests: no mercy!

Today, when the nation is in danger, we can only concentrate all our efforts to save the country, eliminate all traitors, to save it from danger.

### Iron Rings on the Door Stolen

— Ji Yun

People Collecting Scrap Iron; Small Traitors Engage in Profiteering

On the black lacquered doors of ordinary Chinese-style houses in Shanghai, there are always two iron rings nailed side by side. Their purpose is only to be used as handles when opening and closing the door. They can also be used as a substitute for an electric doorbell when calling at the door. By holding the iron ring and striking the iron plate it is connected to, a clanging sound is produced, which is more likely to alert the people inside the house than hitting the wooden door with a bare hand. Although it seems unnecessary to mention the iron ring, which has little value in terms of function and material, unexpectedly this small thing has recently become the subject of a strange case, and one that is related to the interests of the nation.

Three days ago, the iron rings on the doors of nine out of fifteen lane houses in our alley were stolen in the same night, totaling eighteen rings. The first person to discover this was a man who lived a nocturnal life. That day, he returned home at five o'clock in the morning. When he reached for the door handle, he suddenly realized that the two iron rings had disappeared. By then, it was already light, and everything could be clearly distinguished. He glanced around and saw that the rings on several houses across the street and next door were also gone. Although surprised, he did not say anything. Later, he told his family, but everyone just came out to observe casually, guessing that they had probably been sold as scrap metal. Because the value was not high, no one really cared.

Who knew that the next day, the iron rings on the doors of the remaining houses that had not been robbed, as well as those on more than ten houses on neighboring streets, were also stolen. This inevitably made everyone feel strange. An old iron ring sold to a junk shop owner is only worth two or three copper coins. Thieves have never bothered with such a cheap price. Perhaps the recent economic downturn has affected the thieves, so they have had to lower their standards and focus on iron rings. However, there are many other things that are more valuable and easier to steal. Because these rings are firmly nailed with four long nails, stealing them is not easy. The suspicious point was discovered, and it was necessary to investigate it thoroughly. Moreover, although old ones are not worth much when sold, it costs two or three dimes to install new ones. If a stolen ring is installed, the loss is really too great. So, someone found the lane manager to question him. According to him, he has been in Shanghai for more than forty years, and has been managing the lane here for fifteen years. This kind of thing has never happened before, and he has never even heard of it. Thieves want to steal iron rings? Everyone thought it necessary to devise a foolproof plan. After a period of deliberation, they decided that each family would contribute some money and ask the lane manager to hire three people to guard the lane at night. Sure enough, at about one o'clock last night, two men in black quietly came in and were using awls to drill out the iron rings. The three guards jumped out and grabbed them, waking up the homeowners one by one to interrogate them.

Their confession was: There is a shop on North Sichuan Road that buys scrap copper and iron. The shop owner is Chinese and offers a high price, specifically for this type of thing, even half an iron key and a rusty nail are accepted, and each pound can be sold for a certain amount of money, which is more than ten times more expensive than at ordinary shops. There is often a person from in his shop. He sometimes asks us in broken and unpleasant Chinese where the iron comes from and what it is used for, etc. Sometimes he also expresses opinions that are both like an expert and like an amateur. According to the shop owner, he is his former master. He used to be a servant in his house, and now his wife is still working as a nanny for his young master. However, one night when we went to deliver goods, we saw that person transport several boxes of old iron out.

After hearing this, we suddenly realized. Haven't the newspapers been reporting on people buying scrap copper and iron these past few days?

From this incident, we can learn a lesson. From now on, we must pay close attention to small metal objects and take strict precautions. Discarding old copper and iron is a daily occurrence in any household. We can also collect them, and we must not be greedy for small gains and fall for the enemy's tricks. Furthermore, those who are willing to be traitors should be severely punished.

### Growth

— Wei Ke

Time is flowing, the weather is changing, from the season when you need to wear a sweater and then a coat to the present when you can only wear a shirt. But life seems to be like the black roof of the church outside the window, like the gray-yellow walls, like the liver-colored downspouts, dead and沉沉的, without even a slight change.

Often, like a homeless stray dog, dragging an malnourished body, wandering from this road to that road. After seeing enough of the strange faces with hunger and sickness, after seeing enough of the satisfied smiles on the plump faces in the passing silent cars, I always bring a feeling of disgust, with deep sadness, I move my heavy steps and return to my messy abode. And time is superfluous to me, and unconsciously leans towards the street-facing window.

I don't know when my heart solidified, like a fossil; like a withered leaf floating in the air, where is the place to stop? At this time...

The days that have passed will not come again, days are precious. In the past, there were beautiful dreams: days of joy and carefree. But now I send off each day with a sigh and a sad mood.

Ah, I am too weak!

Several messy pieces of paper on the table are covered with crooked small characters, those are the footprints of my troubles. But, who do I show my complaints to? Who sympathizes with the misfortune of others!

As a person, one should have the right to live a good life. Why beg for pity from people, to receive their compassion and bestowal?

The seeds of injustice are growing in my heart. Often leaning on the windowsill or wandering on the streets, it is not for myself, before me pass so many people living in pain!

——What kind of life are we living!

This is Mei's sigh. Isn't it everyone's sigh?

Her sigh made me feel even more pain. Traditional concepts controlled a part of me. My inability to make her life more comfortable made me feel uneasy. But when I looked more broadly and farther around, the wounds in my heart widened even more. Therefore, I also had an excuse to comfort Mei.

——Mei, let's look more openly, look faster, throw the heart that cares only about ourselves out the window.

In fact, everything I say is superfluous. Mei does not depend on others and does not want to live a comfortable life in such days. The impact of the stormy waves of life, she is an independent rock, she has received a great education that cannot be received in school. Who knows her better than me.

But such a reality suffocates us heavily.

The continuous moldy rains confine us at home, for several days we can't go out to breathe. Sometimes the sun just came out, but we were afraid to go out because of the mud on the streets and the disgusting moldy rain. In our small world, time lengthens indefinitely.

——Is it like this, like this forever?

As soon as such a terrible question pops out of our mouths, a deeper and longer silence will envelop us.

But I would strike my fist in the air, and Mei would burst out laughing for no reason. To third parties, our way of venting our inner depression would make them think we were crazy.

——Mei, we must live with meaning!

## Page 16

——Yes, we must live well.

We picked up our old dreams again.

——Will there be good days coming someday?

——We must rely on our own strength.

Life is originally beautiful.

So, a ray of bright smile constantly nourished Mei's calm eyes, words of complaint no longer floated from her anemic lips, replacing them were endless hopes and plans.

The moldy rain seems to never stop, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, drifting diagonally with the east wind. The sky has completely changed, not a single patch of blue can be seen. The sky is so low that it touches the roof directly.

Gloomy time, gloomy space, gloomy life, gloominess crammed into our hearts again, gradually filling it.

In the morning, we finally felt a burst of relief: golden sunlight slanted into the room, the rain stopped last night.

Mei was the first to jump out of bed, stretching her bulging chest as much as possible outside the windowsill, combing her disheveled hair back, greedily inhaling the fresh air.

I continued to lie in bed. I was thinking about how to start my work this day.

——Flowers, flowers, how well the flowers are blooming, look!

Mei called out almost in surprise, turning back to greet me, then turned back again. I laid on her back with a doubtful heart, the fragrance of her hair tickled my nose, I kissed her there.

Sure enough, all the earthenware pots were full of luxuriant and vibrant flowers. In addition, next to the flower pots, several irregular-shaped petals lay quietly.

I opened my eyes wide in surprise, this was a miracle.

Before the moldy rain, the family living on the second floor placed four flower pots on the wall, each pot planted with flower seedlings less than five inches high, thin flower branches with pitiful small red leaves, only one flower pot had a water red flower blooming. Mei said that the unnamed flower was a crabapple flower. I liked the water red color of the crabapple flower very much, and I paid attention to it for the first few days. But afterwards I avoided looking at it, because of its weakness, its shrinking and pitiful appearance in the wind and rain, I thought it would not grow very strongly, and it would not withstand the continuous wind and rain, the weak flower seedlings would die young. I thought of the tragic fate of the crabapple flower, and I thought of myself...

And now, in front of me, are the flowers that have grown strongly under the ravages of wind and rain!

I wanted to shout loudly, I wanted to cry, but I held Mei's shoulders tightly with trembling hands, I murmured

——This is growth, this is growth!

——What? What are you saying?

Mei turned her head to ask me, her eyes close to my mouth.

——This is growth. If I were those flowers, I would also be willing to be those petals that were knocked down by the rain.
