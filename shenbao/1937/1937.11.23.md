### The Enemy Advances by Land and Sea; Our Army Firmly Defends Jiangyin and Wuxi Positions

Enemy Artillery Shells Duanshan Island, Attempting to Breach the Jiangyin Blockade Line; Fierce Skirmish Erupts in Dongting Town on the Wuxi-Changshu Road; The Enemy Invading Jiaxing Advances Past Puyuan, Peering into Tongxiang; We Deploy 200,000 Troops to Defend Nanjing

After a week of bloody battles on the first line of national defense, stretching from Fushan on the Yangtze River to Zhapu in Hangzhou Bay, our army was forced to abandon that line and retreat to strongholds such as Jiangyin, Wuxi, Changxing, Yixing, Chongde, Xiashi, and Haiyan. The situation on the eastern front has thus entered a new phase. In addition to our forces digging in west of that line, fighting at every turn, we have also established a second Yangtze River blockade line at Jiaoshan in Zhenjiang. Simultaneously, we are reinforcing fortifications in the 20-kilometer area surrounding Nanjing, assembling 200,000 heavily armed troops in preparation for a decisive battle with the enemy. Our military authorities have been directing operations from somewhere on the front lines in recent days, displaying remarkable composure and extraordinary resolve. This newspaper obtained detailed information yesterday regarding the situation and battles on various fronts, which are described below: ㊀ On the south bank of the Yangtze River, after the fall of the Fushan fort, enemy warships began to advance westward in droves, attempting to break the Jiangyin blockade line. From the morning of the 21st onwards, they have been heavily shelling our positions near Duanshan Island from the waters east of Duanshan. Our Jiangyin fortresses have responded with heavy artillery fire. ㊁ The enemy in the Changshu area, numbering over two regiments, after occupying Changshu, is now advancing fiercely westward along the southern bank of Shanghu Lake on the Wuxi-Changshu Road, equipped with mechanized units, aiming for Wuxi. Last night (21st), a fierce skirmish erupted near Dongting Town. The sound of artillery fire was clearly audible in Wuxi. ㊂ The enemy advancing westward from the Suzhou front, with a force of over two divisions, after occupying Suzhou, is now advancing directly on Wuxi along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line. Fierce fighting is currently taking place on both sides of Zhoujingxiang, southeast of Wuxi. The enemy is resorting to its old tactics, deploying a large number of motorboats to transport marines along the northern shore of Lake Tai, attempting to outflank Wuxi from the rear. However, our army has heavily garrisoned the northern shore of Lake Tai, along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line, and the enemy in that area will undoubtedly be dealt a severe blow. ㊃ On the south bank of Lake Tai, the enemy has invaded Wuxing from Gucun to the west. Intense fighting is currently taking place five or six kilometers west of Gucun. According to other reports, fighting has already reached the outskirts of Wuxing. Our army, under pressure from the enemy advancing by water along the south bank of Lake Tai, appears poised to abandon Wuxing. ㊄ The enemy advancing from Jiaxing, also numbering over one division, is advancing in two directions: one westward towards Chongde and Shimen, currently in a standoff around Puyuan and Tongxiang; the other southwestward along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line towards Xiashi, currently locked in a stalemate between Wangdian and Xiashi. The enemy advancing along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is still being blocked by our heavy forces on the Pinghu-Zhapu line.

### Jiangyin's Defenses are Tight

The Fushan fortress on the south bank of the Yangtze River and the Langshan fortress on the north bank serve as protection for the Jiangyin fortresses, forming a dangerous salient. However, after our army withdrew from Changshu and Suzhou, Fushan was lost. Consequently, dozens of enemy warships sailed upstream, attempting to breach our Yangtze River blockade line and threaten Zhenjiang and Nanjing. The enemy is currently planning to land at Duanshan Island and Zhouzhuang, east of Jiangyin. Enemy warships engaged in fierce artillery battles with our Jiangyin fortresses yesterday. We are now preparing a second blockade line near Zhenjiang to prevent the enemy from penetrating further. Our defenses in the Jiangyin area are tight, and if the enemy attacks, we will put up a fierce resistance.

[Nanjing] According to an official announcement this morning, defensive fortifications have been constructed in the 20-kilometer zone around Nanjing. The population continues to evacuate, and Nanjing is gradually becoming a ghost town. 80% of the shops are closed. (National Telegram, 22nd)

### Fierce Fighting in Gucun and Jicun

The enemy advancing westward along the Huguang-Jiaxing Highway, after passing through Wangjiangjing, Shengze, Pingwang, Meiyan, and Zhenze and reaching Nanxun, has engaged in fierce fighting with our army in the Wuzhen area. At the same time, we have mobilized a large force from Huzhou to encircle and attack from the east. In the past two days, the fighting in Gucun, west of Nanxun, and in Jicun, about five kilometers further west, has been extremely intense. Although the distance from Jicun to the east gate of Huzhou is over 20 kilometers, our army has built extremely solid fortifications in the area outside the city, sufficient for a firm defense. However, the enemy is constantly using a large number of motorboats to exert pressure along the south bank of Lake Tai. Yesterday, a large number of enemy aircraft flew to the rear of this area and carried out a massive bombing raid, destroying many villages.

[Hangzhou] The enemy harassing Jiaxing advanced past Puyuan on the morning of the 21st, peering into Tongxiang. Our army is currently blocking and attacking them outside the city. In Wuxing, our army has built solid positions outside the city, preparing to fight to the death with the enemy. (Central News Agency Telegram, 21st)

### Enemy Troops in Zhapu Repelled

[Hangzhou] At about 2:00 PM on the 20th, about 200 enemy soldiers were spotted in Zhapu and have already been repelled by us. On the Pinghu front, more than a thousand enemy soldiers arrived on the 20th and appear to be attempting to infiltrate Haiyan. Enemy soldiers are also entrenched on the islands of Chuanhu in Dinghai, apparently wounded soldiers recuperating there. (Central News Agency Telegram, 21st)

[Nanjing] According to news received here, after the Japanese army occupied Changshu and Suzhou, they continued to advance westward towards Wuxi. From the 20th to the morning of the 22nd, the fighting in that area was very fierce. Japanese warships on the Yangtze River continued to bombard Jiangyin, attempting to break through the Chinese army's blockade line. This morning, the weather cleared, and a large number of Japanese aircraft mobilized, flying to Wuxi and Jiangyin to carry out large-scale bombing raids. However, there have been no changes in the Chinese army's positions. Furthermore, the fighting on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is also very intense. The Japanese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, in order to coordinate with the Japanese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, has launched an attack on Wangdian, aiming for Hangzhou. The Japanese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is currently still engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army near Wuxing. (News Telegram, 22nd)

### Our Army Firmly Defends Tongxiang and Chongde

After Jiaxing was occupied by the enemy, Haiyan and Xiashi suddenly became critical. Enemy warships in Hangzhou Bay have been continuously shelling the Haiyan area for days. The enemy in Jiaxing has launched attacks in two directions: one along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road towards Wangdian, where we have heavy forces stationed and are engaged in fierce battles with the enemy. Wangdian has been repeatedly gained and lost, but we are still holding on. The other route is by waterway towards Shimen and Tongxiang, where the fighting is intense. Our positions from Xiashi and Changan to Tongxiang, Shimen, and Chongde are closely linked and can be firmly defended. As for the enemy advancing westward along the Sujia Road from Zhenze and Nanxun, they occupied Gucun the day before yesterday, and yesterday there were reports that they had also occupied Wuxing.

### Enemy Not Landed at Langshan

It was rumored yesterday that enemy warships were shelling Langshan, with the intention of landing on the north bank of the Yangtze River to outflank the Jiangyin blockade line, and that Langshan had been occupied by the enemy. This caused much discussion and widespread panic. This newspaper's reporters made many inquiries to confirm, but were unable to verify. Later, the Taikoo Company's Wuhu steamer arrived in Shanghai from Wuhu at 5:00 PM last night. According to a passenger, Mr. So-and-so, he left Tiantonggang in Nantong at 9:30 AM that morning, and the area was calm and normal. Two Japanese shallow-draft gunboats were anchored in the waters off Langshan, and there were 40 to 50 Japanese transport ships and warships off Fushan on the south bank of the Yangtze River, but they were not firing. At 2:30 PM, when the steamer arrived at Liuhekou, no sound of gunfire was heard, suggesting that there was no shelling or landing at Langshan. Later, the reporter met with an employee of the Wuhu steamer, who, when asked about the situation in Nantong, gave a concurring account, confirming that there was definitely no unusual activity on the north bank of the Yangtze River.

[Nantong] The number of enemy vessels in the Langfu crossing waters has increased again, attempting to advance westward and break the Jiangyin blockade line. We have strengthened our defenses to prevent this. (Special Telegram, 22nd)

(Nantong Correspondent) After the Shanghai battle situation shifted, the Nantong area saw a sharp increase in enemy vessels in the Langfu crossing waters, reaching a maximum of 83 ships. Since the 14th, they have been continuously firing at the south bank day and night. On the 17th and 18th, the river was shrouded in thick fog, and visibility was extremely poor, with no movement from enemy vessels. From 6:00 AM on the 19th, they resumed aimless blind shelling of Fushan Port and Changyinsha. Changyinsha protects Yu Cheng and is still firmly defended by our army. Although the enemy has attempted to land, they have been unable to succeed. Nantong is located in the rear on the north bank of the Yangtze River and is not of major military importance. However, in order to consolidate coastal defenses, all ports have been closed, and heavy troops have long been stationed there, so there is no cause for concern about security. In the past few days, British merchant ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo companies have been traveling between Nantong and Shanghai, transporting goods and passengers, and connecting to inland river steamers to Tongzhen, connecting with the upper Yangtze River. Since the fighting in Shanghai shifted westward, mail parcels from Shanghai to various ports on the Yangtze River have been forwarded through Nantong. The Jiangsu Postal Administration has now transferred large postal trucks and steamers to Tong, to transport mail parcels to Zhenjiang and various places in northern Jiangsu.

### Another 2,000 Enemy Reinforcements Arrive

Around 7:00 AM yesterday morning (22nd), three more enemy transport ships converted from merchant vessels, No. 316 Fukumaru, No. 366 Beijingmaru, and No. 354 Shinyomaru, docked at the Huangpu, Osaka, and Huishan docks, carrying approximately 2,000 enemy reinforcements. (Central News Agency)

Yesterday morning, the enemy Red Cross ship converted from a merchant vessel, Taishanmaru, sailed to the Osaka dock, and transported approximately 1,000 wounded soldiers who had gradually recovered from various enemy military hospitals in the eastern Shanghai area, to Japan last night for recuperation. At the same time, the vacated beds will accommodate newly returned wounded soldiers from the front. (Central News Agency)

The two enemy Red Cross ships, Dajimaru, which sailed to Shanghai the day before yesterday (21st), unloaded a large amount of medical supplies at the Huishan and Osaka docks, and last night loaded more than 1,500 enemy wounded soldiers before setting sail for Japan this morning. (Central News Agency)

### Our Army's Withdrawal from Suzhou and Jiaxing

[Wuxi] After our army blocked the enemy in the Zhengyi area on the eastern front, the two sides have been in a standoff for several days. The enemy's strength in that area was initially not very strong, and after being severely attacked by us for several days, they did not dare to advance quickly. They then resorted to indiscriminate bombing of our rear by air force. Zhengyi, Weiting, Suzhou and other places were severely bombed, and many of our fortifications were destroyed. In particular, enemy planes dropped more than 1,000 bombs and many incendiary bombs in and around Suzhou City on the 14th and 15th, burning a third of the entire city, causing countless civilian casualties, a scene too horrible to look at. In order to avoid sacrifices and adjust the front line, our army withdrew from Zhengyi to a new position in the western suburbs of Suzhou on the 20th. The enemy did not dare to advance at that time. It was heard that on the 21st, the Japanese entered Suzhou City. In Changshu, the enemy repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the city from Hupukou, and also bombed it by air. In order to avoid a tortuous battle line, our army retreated from Changshu City to a new position, which is now a straight line. Heavy troops are deployed in all important strongholds. Also, on the Sujia Railway, because the enemy has broken through our Pingwang Station, Jiaxing has also fallen into enemy hands, and Pinghu and Zhapu are also in critical condition. Our army ordered all armies to defend each stronghold on the Sujia Road to the death, and at the same time deployed new positions outside the cities of Wuxing and Tongxiang. At present, the left and right wings of our entire line are echoing each other remotely, and the defense is easy. (Central News Agency Telegram, 22nd)

### Enemy Uses Firewood and Bamboo Rafts to Transport to the Front

Three enemy transport ships converted from merchant ships, Sanhemaru, Haisemaru, and the 3rd Ryumaru, fully loaded with ammunition and bamboo rafts, etc., sailed to Nanhuangpu the day before yesterday, moored at Minhang Town and unloaded ashore. Yesterday, dozens of trucks used by the enemy army transported them to the front in batches. In addition, four enemy gunboats were parked in the Nanhuangpu area, patrolling the river surface from time to time for security. (Central News Agency)

Around noon yesterday, two more enemy transport ships, No. 373 (name unknown) and No. 216 Yamagatamaru, sailed to Shanghai, berthed at the Qiujiang Wharf and the fish market riverfront, and unloaded the ammunition they were carrying onto many barges moored next to the ships, which were successively transported to the upper reaches of the Wusong River and transferred to Lake Tai. At the same time, the enemy transport ship Nachimaru, which has been sailing to Shanghai successively in recent days, unloaded wooden boards at the China Merchants Bureau Middle Wharf, and the Chikugomaru at the Huishan Wharf, and the Yayoi Maru at the New Huishan Wharf, unloaded ammunition into small motorboats, and each boat, after being fully loaded with ammunition, drove to the front for application. (Central News Agency)

The enemy crane ship Seikamar, converted from a merchant ship, sailed to Shanghai the day before yesterday and berthed at the fish market riverfront, preparing to lift and repair the various ships that were sunk near the Nan Ning and Shao wharves of the 16th Concession to seal off the Huangpu River, so that they could be used immediately. (Central News Agency)

Around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday (22nd), an enemy transport ship sailed to the North Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, and the No. 376 Hokkomaru sailed to the Huangpu Wharf, unloading aircraft parts and countless guns and ammunition. (Central News Agency)

### Japanese Embassy Announces Application Regarding Two Concessions

Pay Attention to the Actions of Administrative Organs; The Authorities will Respond as Much as Possible

The North China Daily News reports that yesterday (21st) a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy announced that Japan intends to take over the various administrative activities previously carried out by the Chinese in the Public Concession and the French Concession. The Japanese authorities said that the administrative power of the Municipal Council is limited to the provisions of the Land Regulations, and the Chinese have carried out administrative activities outside the scope of the Municipal Council. Now that the Japanese army has occupied the estuary of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the situation has changed, so the Japanese authorities intend to take over from the Chinese in principle. The agencies that the Japanese authorities intend to take over include the Customs, the Post Office, the Telegraph Administration, and the Courts. The spokesperson mentioned the Customs, saying that this agency is an agent of the Chinese government, and many foreigners are among its staff. In addition, the income of the Customs has been used to pay off loans, so special consideration is needed. The Post Office is currently not intended to be interfered with because the Japanese authorities do not want to interfere with public convenience. The same is true for the Telegraph Administration and the Courts, but the Japanese authorities reserve the right to speak out on the actions of these agencies. According to the above news, this was announced after the Japanese authorities asked the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession to eliminate all activities of the Central Government commissioners and other anti-Japanese elements last Saturday and Sunday. According to the spokesperson, the Japanese Consul General Okamoto has notified the Municipal Council and the French authorities, making the following applications: ㊀ Curb anti-Japanese and other malicious activities, disband all organizations such as Kuomintang branches, prohibit the posting of anti-Japanese slogans and the distribution of anti-Japanese texts, as well as the anti-Japanese propaganda of dramas, films, and radio broadcasts, curb the frenzy of Chinese "spies" and the hunt for "traitors." ㊁ Eliminate all central and local agencies of the Central Government and their representatives, and seriously monitor the activities of the Central Government and party leaders. ㊂ Prohibit the inspection of mail and telecommunications by the Central Government. ㊃ Prohibit the inspection of Chinese newspapers and news by the Central Government. ㊄ Prohibit unauthorized radio communication by the Chinese. The spokesperson said that the Public Concession authorities and the French authorities have agreed to implement the application of the Japanese authorities "as much as they can." A spokesperson for the Japanese military then made a statement, saying that the application of the Japanese Consul General was endorsed by Major General Harada, the Japanese military attaché. Harada, representing General Matsui, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army, visited Stirling Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, and Baudet, the French Consul General, stating that the Japanese army considered curbing anti-Japanese activities in the Public Concession and the French Concession necessary for the smooth march of troops in the Shanghai area.

The Ta Kung Pao reported that Harada, the Japanese military attaché, visited the Public Concession and French Concession authorities on behalf of Matsui last Saturday and Sunday, when requesting to curb anti-Japanese activities within the Concession, said that if the steps taken by the two Concession authorities could not achieve the results desired by the Japanese and made the Japanese dissatisfied, the Japanese army reserved the right to take what it deemed necessary steps, and this step would be initiated by the Japanese army alone. When asked to clarify what this application by Harada and the steps that the Japanese were planning to initiate alone, the Japanese spokesperson replied that the Japanese army firmly believed that the authorities concerned would comply with this request, so this step had not yet been planned, because it was not considered necessary at this time. The spokesperson also said that the only difference between the Public Concession and the French Concession in the eyes of the Japanese was that the Public Concession had Japanese participation.

The first time was at about 7:00 AM, when seven enemy bombers dropped several bombs in Lishui and Danyang. The second time was when eight enemy bombers dropped several bombs in Danyang and Zhenjiang. Both times they attempted to attack Nanjing, but seeing that we were prepared, they flew to Jurong and turned back. At about 1:00 PM, several enemy bombers, under the cover of several fighters, invaded Nanjing again. Our air force immediately went to intercept them, and the enemy bombers immediately fled in panic. Their fighters soared over the city of Nanjing with our aircraft, chasing each other and fighting hundreds of rounds. Our anti-aircraft guns also assisted in the battle below, posing a threat to the enemy. After an hour of fierce fighting, one enemy aircraft was hit by us and crashed.

### Central Bank of Guilin Branch Established in Wuzhou

Officially Opens on New Year's Day Next Year, President and Vice President Arrived in Guilin Yesterday

Guilin - Xi Yan, the manager of the Guangxi branch of the Central Bank, and Wu Guangming, the deputy manager, arrived in Guilin on the 22nd. They immediately visited the provincial authorities to discuss financial matters. According to Wu, after the establishment of the branch, its business will include acting as an agent for the national treasury's income and expenditure, issuing banknotes, and handling remittances. On the other hand, it will also involve investigating local finances. If a locality needs construction funds, the central government can instruct the Guilin branch to provide advance payments nearby. Regarding private lending, because the bank is a national financial institution, it will not handle such matters. The rumor that the branch will redeem Guilin banknotes after its establishment is also untrue. The exchange rate between Guilin banknotes and legal tender has been fixed, and they will naturally be used at the same price. The preparations for the branch are nearing completion. The branch is located in Wuzhou and will officially open on New Year's Day next year. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)

### Nine-Power Treaty Conference to Issue Second Declaration

Decides on Indefinite Adjournment to Save Face, US Delegation Ordered to Pack and Return Home

⊙Brussels - The Nine-Power Treaty Conference will reconvene at 5 p.m. today in disappointment and frustration. At that time, the representatives of the various countries will study the draft of the second declaration proposed by the United Kingdom and the United States. This declaration will briefly describe the situation created after Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and decide to adjourn the conference indefinitely. However, the postponement may be delayed and a separate decision may be made. (Havas News Agency dispatch from Brussels on the 22nd)

⊙Brussels - The British and American representatives attending the Beijing conference drafted a declaration last night, working through the night and only completing it at 3 a.m. this morning. It will be discussed with Chairman Spaak and then submitted to the representatives of the British Dominions for study at a meeting this afternoon. This declaration reviews the general situation of the Sino-Japanese conflict and proposes an indefinite adjournment of the Beijing conference. If this draft is approved by the representatives of the various countries, the second and final meeting will be held on the 23rd. (Reuters News Agency dispatch from Brussels on the 22nd)

⊙Brussels - The United States today rejected the United Kingdom's proposal for the two countries to jointly find a way to stop the war in the Far East. The British and American representatives are eager to find a face-saving solution before the Nine-Power Treaty Conference reconvenes at 4 p.m. tomorrow so that it can be presented at the meeting. The above-mentioned proposal is one of the solutions. The United Kingdom advocated that the conference authorize the United Kingdom and the United States to mediate between China and Japan. The American representative, Davis, feared that this move would still be rejected by Japan, so he did not agree. The representatives of the two countries then consulted with each other again, and now a temporary decision has been made to take another method to slightly cover up the failure of the conference and end the current embarrassing situation. The so-called other method is to suggest a temporary adjournment, pending a request from either China or Japan for a resumption of the conference. (National News dispatch from the 21st)

⊙Brussels - The US delegation was ordered today to pack up and prepare to catch the "President Harding" mail ship to New York from Harvard Port. (National News dispatch from the 22nd)

⊙Brussels - The Nine-Power Treaty Conference continued today. The chief representative of the United Kingdom, Eden, the chief representative of France, Tarbes, and the chief representative of the Soviet Union, Litvinov, did not attend. At that time, the United Kingdom will be represented by Dominion Minister Malcolm MacDonald, France will be represented by Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tedesan, and the Soviet Union will be represented by Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Bodankin. It is estimated that the conference will pass a second declaration, which will summarize the new situation created by Japan's refusal to participate in the conference, and announce an indefinite postponement tomorrow. The chief representative of China, Gu Weijun, saw the sudden return of the chief representative of the Soviet Union, Litvinov, the opposition of the chief representative of Italy, Macchi, to the first declaration of the conference, the temporary abandonment of voting rights by the representatives of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, and the increasingly serious attitude of the chief representative of the United States, Davis. He has already understood without any doubt the extent to which the countries can assist China. Therefore, in today's meeting, Gu only protested again against Japan's aggressive actions and requested that the countries provide material assistance to China and stop supplying Japan with arms and money.

### Isolationist Activities in the United States

Strive to Advocate the Implementation of Neutrality Laws

[Washington] Because the representatives of the various countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference attributed the failure of the conference to the United States, a strong resentment has been aroused in the US Congress, and it has attacked the issue of the various countries' failure to pay war debts. US Senator Lewis advocated, "It would be best if President Roosevelt could recall the US representative, because the purpose of this conference is to place the United States in a position to attack Japan, Germany, and Italy." Republican Senator Gray Larris convened a meeting today of supporters of the implementation of neutrality laws to discuss the resolution to implement neutrality laws. Democrat MacLennon Knowles said, "If the United States participates in this conference, it is only right to condemn Japan for violating the Nine-Power Treaty together with other countries." MacLennon Knowles' representative said, "I believe that the best way to achieve peace is to improve the economic situation. If the countries can fulfill their debts, they will not damage international goodwill. Once the problems in the Far East are resolved, commerce can also be improved."

### Changes in British Policy

Clearly Influenced by the Japan-Germany-Italy Pact

▲The Osaka Asahi Shimbun stated that after the establishment of the anti-communist pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, although the British government and the public hold a calm attitude, they generally believe that this pact strengthens the international anti-communist camp. Although the United Kingdom does not express opposition, it adheres to maintaining the status quo and believes that this pact intensifies international confrontation. The United Kingdom's foreign policy is directly affected by the European political situation, namely: ㊀ Germany has always insisted on demanding the recovery of colonies, and Germany's attitude will inevitably be even stronger in the future; ㊁ The United Kingdom's relationship with Italy cannot be fundamentally resolved due to the Mediterranean issue, and there is no hope of improvement in the future; ㊂ Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue in the Far East, the United Kingdom's attitude towards Japan is very different from that of Germany and Italy. However, the sudden establishment of this pact during the Sino-Japanese conflict greatly restricts the United Kingdom's say on the Far East issue. At the same time, Germany and Italy's restrictions on the United Kingdom are even more powerful. In the future, based on this pact, Germany, Italy, and Japan will increase their say. The general idea of the content of this pact is to expand their influence in the Mediterranean policy. Therefore, it is difficult to improve Anglo-Italian relations. Since the United Kingdom cannot take care of itself, why would it be willing to meddle in the Far East issue?

### Economic Sanctions Against Japan

Our Protracted Resistance Can Be Effective

[Washington] According to the research of Dan Schell, a member of the US Foreign Affairs Committee, economic sanctions against Japan can be effective if they are sincerely implemented by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Russia. However, the effect will only be seen after six months. Therefore, the question is whether the Chinese army can withstand the Japanese army's attack during this period.

### Soviet Union's Far East Policy Still Adopts a Cautious Attitude

Unwilling to Risk War, the Red Army Is Strong Enough to Resist Aggression

[Moscow] Soviet Ambassador to China Bogomolov has returned here for more than a month, and no newspapers here have mentioned him. No one knows what Bogomolov is doing in Moscow or why he returned to China. It is unbelievable that Bogomolov has had a disagreement with the Soviet government. However, the Soviet Union's Far East policy does not seem to have changed. In other words, it is avoiding all risks and dangers of war with the greatest caution. Since 1925, Soviet leader Stalin has advocated getting closer to Japan. After the September 18th Incident, Japan wanted to occupy the Chinese Eastern Railway by force, but Stalin still advocated improving relations between Japan and Russia. People here generally believe that the Soviet Red Army is strong enough to repel any Japanese aggression against the Soviet Union, and the Chinese nationalist movement also has strong resistance. However, the results obtained at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference are very small, indicating that the United States is unlikely to take strong action on the Sino-Japanese dispute. Therefore, as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it does not intend to take any action in the Far East. Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese conflict, there has been no significant change in trade between China and Russia, which is very different from the large increase in the volume of trade between the Soviet Union and Spain. (According to the statistics up to the end of July this year, the total value of Soviet goods shipped to Spain was 888,000,000 rubles, an increase of 859,000,000 rubles compared to last year. The value of Spanish goods shipped to the Soviet Union also increased from 5,000,000 rubles to 20,000,000 rubles during the same period.) In addition, according to news from the Chinese Embassy in Russia, 200,000 Koreans this year are unwilling to be ruled by Japan and have moved to Central Asia in the Soviet Union. It is difficult to detect whether there are Japanese spies mixed among these Koreans. Regarding the relations between Japan and Russia, the two sides originally signed a temporary measure on fishing concession rights, allowing Japanese fishermen to fish in Soviet territorial waters. The validity period will expire at the end of this year. However, since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany in November last year, Russia has refused to sign a formal fisheries agreement with Japan. Japan still hopes that a formal agreement can be reached. There have also been disputes over the management and construction of crude oil on Sakhalin Island (Japan has a concession right to crude oil mines on the island). The Soviet Union refused to accept the diameter of the crude oil pipeline to be built with Japan. Although Japan later agreed to reduce it, the dispute has not yet been resolved.

### Japanese Government Eager to Reform Internal Affairs

To Adapt to the Wartime System

[Tokyo] With the aim of completely resolving the China Incident, the government has established the Imperial Headquarters and recently decided on a policy to actively improve various pending issues in domestic affairs. The Imperial Headquarters is a purely command institution, but in the sense of modern warfare, the high degree of unification in operations and military operations naturally requires strong implementation of policies in various administrative departments. Therefore, Prime Minister Konoe, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazami, President of the Planning Board Taki, and Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Funada are considering reforming the cabinet system. However, in practical terms, the reform of the cabinet system, or even the reorganization of the cabinet, cannot be realized urgently due to various reasons. Therefore, Prime Minister Konoe plans to first solve specific domestic problems to cope with the establishment of the Imperial Headquarters and to ensure that there are no regrets in the situation. It is reported that the domestic problems that the government wants to solve now include the establishment of a Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, reform of the civil service system, the General Mobilization Law, the Electricity National Management Law, the National Health Insurance Law, social legislation related to rural areas under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and economic legislation related to the situation under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

### Japan Amends Fisheries Agreement with Russia

[Tokyo] According to information received on the 22nd, negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union to amend the fisheries treaty have progressed to concrete negotiations as a result of a meeting between the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigemitsu, and the Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Stomonyakov, on the 22nd. In that meeting, Ambassador Shigemitsu stated that the current temporary agreement would expire in just over a month, and if this continued, it would become a treaty-less state after January of next year. It was feared that the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union would be damaged, so the Soviet Union should also cooperate with the Japanese government to respect the provisions of the Treaty of Portsmouth, quickly sign the amendment treaty that has become pending, and strive to prevent the worst-case scenario and promote reflection. The Deputy Minister replied that in principle, it should be understood immediately, so in the future, the Japanese Counselor, Mr. Nishi, and the Director of the Far East Department, Kazyrovsky, will conduct technical consultations. Ambassador Shigemitsu must also do his best to promote the establishment of the treaty by meeting with the Deputy Minister when necessary. (Allied News dispatch from the 22nd)

### Contents of the Berlin Talks Are Confidential, Anglo-German Understanding Opens the Door

Hitler Reiterates Colonial Demands, Aims to Recover Them Within Six Years

[London] British Lord Privy Seal Halifax returned here this afternoon after visiting Germany and immediately met with Foreign Secretary Eden, and may meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain to report on the talks with German political figures. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)

[Berlin] British Lord Privy Seal Halifax departed this evening at 9:22 p.m. On the verge of departure, he made a statement to the press, saying that after talks with German leader Hitler and other important government officials, he deeply hoped that he could clarify the relations between Britain and Germany. When reporters asked if he had invited German Foreign Minister Neurath to London to continue the talks, the Lord did not answer, but only said that his trip was confidential in nature and that it was difficult to reveal what issues were discussed with the German authorities before consulting with the British government authorities. German officials were also tight-lipped about the content of the talks, but observers believed that Foreign Minister Neurath's trip to London would not be far off. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 21st)

[Berlin] British Lord Privy Seal Halifax met with American journalists today and said that he had held talks with German leader Hitler, Foreign Minister Neurath, and Air Minister General Goering, and that the content was based on freedom, candor, informality, and trust. Halifax expressed his hope that the result of the talks would open the door to a better understanding between Britain and Germany. Halifax also attached great importance to the enthusiasm with which he was received. Although German newspapers acknowledged that Halifax's visit could increase understanding between the two countries, they pointed out that the talks only communicated opinions and could not be expected to have a positive effect immediately. On the other hand, there was no reason to be disappointed, nor should there be inappropriate hopes, and there was no urgent need for Neurath to visit Britain. (Reuters News Agency dispatch from the 21st)

[London] The Berlin correspondent of the "Manchester Guardian" recently declared, "The German government hopes that after the British Lord Privy Seal Halifax visits Germany, other British dignitaries will follow with formal missions. As for the talks held by Halifax in Germany, in addition to the issue of Germany's demand for colonies, they also touched on other issues in Europe. Halifax has obtained assurances from the German side that the purpose of the Berlin-Rome political axis is not to conflict with the interests of the United Kingdom, and that the anti-communist pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan does not oppose the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and Germany." (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)

[Berlin] Today was the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Nazi Party's local organization in Augsburg, and leader Hitler came to participate in the celebration. In his speech, Hitler predicted that Germany would recover all of its colonies within six years. Hitler said, "We should continue to demand colonies, and our call for them will become louder and louder until the world cannot refuse. This work is extremely difficult, but the most difficult part has now been completed." Regarding Germany's four-year plan, Hitler said, "Although this plan seeks national economic independence, it does not mean that Germany does not hope for the restoration of colonies. Germany's efforts to strengthen itself are an absolute necessity, because only in this way can we demand the return of colonies." Finally, Hitler reiterated, "Today, all countries are unwilling to mention the issue of colonies, but after a year, they will get used to hearing it. After three years, they will realize that there is a need to correct the situation. After six years, they will understand that practical steps must be taken, and the most important truth is that Germany today has a new and strong army and has eliminated the previous sense of inferiority." (Reuters News Agency dispatch from the 21st)

[London] This morning, the local newspapers here jointly commented on Hitler's speech on the colonial issue in Augsburg yesterday and the Halifax talks, because they were connected in the order of their occurrence. The Daily Express declared that Hitler's speech should be noted because it was made at a time when it was being announced here that Halifax's visit to Germany had promoted Anglo-German relations and that formal negotiations would be held. Did the Anglo-German talks not involve the colonial issue? The Daily Mail reported that formal Anglo-German negotiations have now begun, and the obstacles between the two countries have been removed by this informal talk. British people believe that the increase in friendship between the two countries will be seen in the holding of formal negotiations, because from this, a permanent friendship between the two countries can be built. Most other newspapers believe that the result of the Halifax talks is indeed as Halifax said to German visitors, the door to understanding has been opened. (Haitong News dispatch from the 22nd)

### Britain Prepares to Repay War Debt to the US

Facilitating Trade Agreement Negotiations

[London] According to reliable sources here today, Britain intends to continue repaying its war debt to the United States. The British Cabinet is prepared to discuss this matter. It is said that financial leaders have advised Prime Minister Chamberlain to continue paying the war debt to the US, as this would facilitate negotiations for a British-American trade agreement and potentially secure future economic assistance from the US. However, experts believe that complete repayment of the war debt by Britain is impossible. Therefore, it may be necessary to increase British exports to the US as a condition. In short, this issue requires negotiation. (National Telegram, 21st)

### Japan's Military Expansion Affects National Economy

Exports to China Almost Completely Halted; Small and Medium Enterprises Cry Out in Distress

The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the cessation of Japanese exports to China and the cutoff of Chinese raw material imports to Japan, coupled with restrictions on general trade, have dealt a severe blow to small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises across the country. According to a survey by the Central Association of Commercial Associations, among the commercial and industrial enterprises exporting to China, those facing near extinction due to stalled sales account for 31% of the association's membership. This is the direct impact on small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises as producers. At the same time, due to the incident, the progress of large-enterprise dominance has led to fierce competition with small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises. The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry is striving to find ways to provide relief, such as converting small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises into military suppliers like provision factories, clothing factories, and weapons factories. They plan to establish industrial consultants, assigning them to various regions to directly guide and mediate for small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises. However, small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises are currently in dire straits, making relief a most difficult practical problem. Converting to military industry is an emergency relief measure, but the prerequisite is still the issue of survival, which is also deeply related to the overall national economy of Japan.

### Enemy Naval and Air Forces Frequently Harass Xiamen

Multiple Attacks in Five Days

Xiamen Correspondence: After the enemy occupied Kinmen, they assumed various attack preparations on Xiamen, especially after the 10th of this month. On the 10th, enemy ships shelled our fortress batteries with 150-160 rounds. On the same day, enemy aircraft dropped eight bombs. On the afternoon of the 12th, two enemy ships, with a small boat flying the British flag, approached the Wutong shore in the northern part of Xiamen Island from a great distance. They probed the water depth along the coast and were repelled by our defending troops with machine-gun fire. Five or six enemy soldiers were injured and fell on the boat. The enemy ships then fired seven rounds from a distance towards the shore before retreating. From 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 13th, an enemy seaplane flew from Kinmen, making four round trips to bomb our fortress xxx battery, dropping two bombs each time. At 9:00 AM on the 14th, an enemy cruiser moved from Kinmen to the northern part of Xiamen Island. At 10:00 AM, it fired at Wutong from about 1,000 meters offshore, ceasing fire at 11:00 AM, having fired a total of twenty-eight rounds. From 1:30 PM to 4:30 PM in the afternoon, another enemy aircraft came, making four round trips, dropping a total of seven bombs on our fortress xxx battery (located inside the south shore of Xiamen Port, belonging to Haicheng County). From the 10th to the 14th, enemy ships shelled three times, and enemy aircraft attacked three times, firing nearly one hundred rounds and dropping twenty-three bombs. Our batteries and fortifications suffered no damage. Only on the 14th did one bomb land in the Fengtou Community of Wutong, injuring four pigs and one cow. Except for eight rounds fired by our batteries in retaliation on the 10th, we remained calm and did not retaliate. However, the enemy's aim seems to be to test our strength while destroying our fortress and fortifications.

From general observations, the enemy's intention to capture Xiamen is due to Xiamen's deep and wide harbor. After the founding of the Republic of China, the Japanese Combined Fleet came to Xiamen three times. The last time was in August of last year, gathering the elite of the Japanese First and Second Fleets, consisting of more than eighty ships, including the Nagato and other battleships with a maximum displacement of over 33,000 tons, all of which were able to maneuver freely. Moreover, a large airfield can be built on Xiamen Island, and the climate is good and suitable for flying. Now, the enemy only occupies Kinmen, where the harbor is narrow with high waves, making it difficult to berth many ships. The island has undulating hills and cannot be used as an airfield. The sea breeze is also strong and unsuitable for takeoffs and landings. The sea and air conditions are not good. Therefore, the enemy has long desired to capture Xiamen. Furthermore, Xiamen is only 220 nautical miles from Hong Kong, 500 nautical miles from the Philippines, and separated from Taiwan by a strait. It is located in the armpit of Taiwan, holding the lifeline of British and American territories in the Far East. However, whether the situation in terms of time and circumstances allows them to calmly invade Xiamen at this time is another major question.

Not long after the enemy occupied Kinmen, they suddenly changed their policy. Except for allowing coastal fishermen to fish by flying the Japanese flag and encouraging them to take grain to sea to exchange for white sugar, groceries, and drugs, they recently shipped 3,000 bags of rice from Taiwan to Kinmen due to soaring prices in Kinmen, selling each dou (peck) for 6.5 jiao (cents), while the original price was 8 jiao. Matches were sold for one copper coin per box, while the original price was four coins. Pork rose to 3.5-4 jiao per jin (pound) and was reduced to 1.5 jiao. They deliberately lowered the prices of all daily necessities, but only accepted white currency (silver dollars), refusing to accept our country's banknotes. They also specially purchased gold and silver, and used miscellaneous goods to lure people into smuggling to southern Fujian. All this is a demonstration of power and a tactic of enticement.

Nanhui is as Peaceful as Usual

It has been noted in this newspaper that no false county magistrate Pan Meiting and maintenance association, etc., have been found in Fengxian. Now, according to a shop assistant of a military clothing store in the county, who transported goods to Shanghai, there has been no trace of the enemy in the county to this day. However, robbery cases occur frequently in the countryside, being brazen and undisguised, even Nanhui cannot escape it. Those who have taken refuge in the countryside, seeing this situation, are all worried. Many have automatically organized patrol teams. On the 11th, a famous bandit from Chaohu was captured, and two bandit dens were successively busted. Therefore, order has gradually been restored in recent days. At the same time, according to the manager of a southern goods store in Qingcun Port, the market in the eastern part of the county is still normal. As for transportation, one can go through Nanhui and take a boat to Shanghai, which is quite convenient.

### Enemy Troops in Central Shanxi Plan Another Large-Scale Southern Invasion

Our Troops in Eastern Shanxi, Western Shanxi, and Northern Shanxi Have Completed Deployments

Linfen: After more than ten days of replenishment, the enemy troops in central Shanxi are now actively planning another large-scale southern invasion. Their main force has concentrated in the Yuci and Taigu area, totaling twelve regiments, under the command of Itagaki. In the Taiyuan area, there are seven regiments under the command of Kawagishi, urgently moving towards Fenyang and Lishi. The enemy's intention seems to be to strike east and west Shanxi as a cover, while their main force continues to advance south along the Tongpu Railway.

They were fiercely attacked by our ambushing troops, and many enemy soldiers were killed. They then fled north to central Shanxi. Our various lines of defense in eastern and western Shanxi have now been fully deployed. We are determined to inflict a heavy blow on the invading enemy.

Vice President of the Executive Yuan Kong Xiangxi answered questions from reporters and made the following remarks: In order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and engage in long-term resistance, the Central Government has specially relocated the National Government to Chongqing. Its important significance has been clearly stated in the National Government's declaration. What I can tell you now is that the enemy is using its violence to threaten our capital, thinking that our country can be subdued. They do not know that our greatest determination has long been established. This relocation of the National Government is not to abandon the capital, but to express our more determined will to the people and friendly nations in the stage of long-term resistance, and to give the enemy a warning. During the European War, the French capital was also threatened, but they were able to achieve the final victory. We all have the determination to die, and our blood and land are united as one. Even if the enemy uses its violence and penetrates deep into our interior, it will eventually be destroyed by us. As for the planning of finance, currency, and economy, the government has long made arrangements, and friendly nations have also provided much assistance. Therefore, no matter how long the resistance lasts, finances can be managed to the best of our ability. It is hoped that local officials will properly guide the people, each engaging in their respective professions, working hard with peace of mind, and managing their businesses with composure. This will be of great benefit to long-term resistance. (Central News Agency, 22nd)

[Chongqing] Since the relocation of the various departments of the National Government to Chongqing, preparations have been made to welcome them. The office locations of the National Government and various departments, as well as the Chairman's headquarters, have been surveyed and are being actively arranged. (Central News Agency, 22nd)

[Chongqing] The first batch of personnel from the National Government to relocate to Chongqing has passed through Hankou and is heading west. They will change to boats in Yichang to come to Sichuan. Whether Chairman Lin will transfer to a boat in Yichang to come to Chongqing has not yet been confirmed here. The transportation matters are the responsibility of the Executive Yuan's Transportation Office. Deputy Director-General Cheng Tiangu will lead four experts to Sichuan to supervise production activities. The provincial government has sent a telegram to welcome them. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)

[Chongqing] In order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and engage in long-term resistance, the National Government has issued a declaration to relocate to Chongqing.

[Nanjing] US Ambassador to China Johnson is scheduled to set up an embassy office on the USS Luzon this morning at 11:00 AM. He will sail upriver tomorrow or Wednesday, stopping at various ports along the way to pick up American nationals or encourage them to travel later on the USS Ovol from Wuhu. It is understood that the US government believes the embassy should operate simultaneously on the USS Luzon and in Nanjing. There are still twenty-four American nationals remaining in Beijing, so the embassy has assigned three people to protect the侨民 (overseas Chinese). It is understood that the embassy can be used when the American nationals are in Beijing, and Johnson's residence is also planned to be used as a residence for the 侨民 (overseas Chinese). (Yimin Telegraph, 22nd)

[Nanjing] The German Embassy has prepared a special sign to distribute to the German nationals remaining in Beijing, to be hung on the roofs to identify them and prevent Japanese air raids. (Haitong Telegraph, 22nd)

### Pudong's Defenses Are Empty, Guarded by Puppet Police

But the Area Remains Extremely Chaotic

After most of the enemy troops in Pudong were transferred to the front line for combat, the defenses were so empty that it was almost impossible to deploy guards. They had no choice but to accelerate the training of 150 puppet police officers recruited a few days ago. They wore yellow uniforms and carried wooden sticks, trying to resume their posts on Laiyi Wharf Street yesterday morning. When these puppet police officers initially applied, they only knew they were being sent to Pudong to help refugees, but once they entered the area, they lost all freedom and realized they had been fooled. They wanted to regret it, but it was too late. Therefore, some did not want to be controlled by others and took the opportunity to escape. The actual number is now less than 120, divided into three shifts day and night. Each shift has less than 40 people, standing dejectedly on the street under the armed supervision of the enemy, looking extremely miserable. The wharves along the Pudong River south of Lujiazui are still guarded by enemy soldiers. The enemy believes that the number of puppet police is too small, confined to a corner, and cannot be distributed, so most of the area remains in a chaotic state. Thieves run rampant, and it is impossible to cope with the situation. Therefore, they plan to continue recruiting a large number of puppet police, but the original old police officers all deeply understand the righteousness and have scattered to change careers, so recruitment is very difficult.

### Vegetable Supply Is Smooth, Prices Are Significantly Reduced

Seafood and Other Types Are Still Extremely Scarce, Flour Prices Rose Again Yesterday

The source of vegetables in this city has gradually become smooth after the active dredging by various parties. Shandong, Nantong, and other places have transported vegetables, and those transported from Pudong are even more enthusiastic, with four to five transports from Gaoqiao every day. There are various vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage, green vegetables, and radishes, which are sufficient to meet the needs of this city. Therefore, prices have been significantly reduced in recent days. However, because it is difficult for fishermen to catch fresh fish, the market is still extremely scarce. The prices of fresh shrimp and river fish are extremely high, and it is not easy to buy them. Yesterday, the price of flour rose again, with each bag selling for 4.4 yuan in legal tender, and secondary flour costing 3.7 yuan, an increase of 0.25 yuan and 0.3 yuan respectively compared to before. Therefore, it is very difficult for the common people in this city to maintain their livelihoods amidst this high inflation. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will quickly find ways to suppress this trend.

### Two Groups Advocate One-Jiao Movement

Cilianhui Suggests Implementation Measures

Cilianhui: The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's Committee for Relief of War-Zone Refugees yesterday approved the suggestion of Chen Jisheng to quickly promote a daily one-jiao movement to relieve compatriots in distress. The association has replied with its agreement and has decided to implement it immediately. The following are Chen's suggested measures: ㊀ Refugees need one jiao per person per day. It is hoped that each family can bear the food ration for one refugee, that is, donate one silver jiao (coin) per day, which can save one person's life. Donations of more are especially welcome. ㊁ The one-jiao donation can be deducted from the food expenses or by reducing one meal on Sundays, which is easy and affordable. ㊂ Each family should first fill out a subscription form, confirming the supply for one or several refugees. Then, every five days, the association will send someone to collect the donation and issue a receipt immediately. As for various groups or neighborhoods, they can recommend one representative to collect and submit the donations to the association, or the association can entrust one resident in each household to collect the donations. ㊃ The association will thoroughly investigate the number of refugees and properly allocate the funds donated by each family to the recipient refugees, and the names of the recipient refugees, the names and addresses of the shelters where they are located will be detailed on the notification slip, which will be given to the donors (or group/neighborhood representatives) for their records, so that they can visit the refugees who have received donations in the shelters on the dates stipulated by the association to inquire about the actual situation.

City Chamber of Commerce: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Wartime Service Corps of the Insurance Industry to launch a daily one-jiao movement to relieve refugees and asked for promotion, etc. The Chamber of Commerce then issued a notice to various trade associations to jointly advocate for it, stating: Upon investigation, the number of refugees temporarily sheltering in Shanghai is greater than before. Transportation is limited and cut off, and there is no way to send them back. The future is long, and we must plan a relief plan. The method suggested by the group is simple and easy to implement and more sustainable. We hereby request your association to inform your colleagues, widely advocate for it, and strive for its popularity, so that small contributions can add up to a great effect, and the survivors can avoid waiting for their end. We sincerely hope for this.

### The Dredging Bureau Negotiates for Large Dredger

The "North China Daily News" reports that after the large dredger "Jianshe" of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau was occupied by the Japanese naval authorities, the relevant authorities have negotiated with the Japanese Ambassador to China. According to the International Protocol of 1901, dredging work is carried out and special donations are collected under the name of "Dredging Donation" to cover the expenses of this work. 80% of it is paid by foreign ships, and an international bureau is established to manage the affairs of the Dredging Bureau. The international bureau has one representative from China and various countries, as well as representatives from various chambers of commerce.

### Yangtze River Water Drops, Flood Warning Vessels Withdrawn

Navigation in the Middle Reaches Gradually Becomes Difficult, Winter Low-Water Season Has Arrived

The Yangtze River water volume has passed the major flood season, and the winter low-water season is approaching, so the water level is dropping daily. The flood warning piles along the river have begun to be removed. The Datong News Agency reporter reports the following details:

Middle Reaches Water Drops

The Jianghai Customs announced the following river gauge readings yesterday: Changsha 10 feet 9 inches, Yichang 10 feet 8 inches (above are the middle reaches), Jiujiang 14 feet 7 inches, Anqing 33 feet 4 inches, Wuhu 24 feet 2 inches, Zhenjiang 14 feet 4 inches. The water levels are dropping daily, especially in the middle reaches. Ships with excessive drafts are gradually finding it difficult to navigate upstream.

Withdrawal of Flood Warning Vessels

During the major flood season, the flood warning lights and piles set up by the customs along the river have also begun to be removed, including ㊀ the special flood warning vessel for the Jiujiang section, ㊁ the lower light vessel of the Guijiaba South Waterway, and the Chiko light pile, and ㊂ the flood warning buoy at the lower end of the Anqing Waterway. The patrol company has notified all Chinese and foreign shipping companies in this port to pay attention.

### Marginalia from Lieshan

— Feng Lieshan

Regarding the Smoking Question

It seems that Mr. Xu Zhimo once mentioned that the advantage of the education law at Oxford University in England lies in professors teaching students to smoke. He praised this smoking system, saying that after a few years, when these students go out into society, they immediately become authentic gentlemen. Mr. Xu probably overlooked the fact that most of the students at Oxford and Cambridge Universities are children of British nobles and wealthy families. Their future paths are almost ready-made, so he attributes this effect to smoking. In fact, the main purpose of these two universities is to produce ruling talents, not scientific experts. If smoking really has such a great connection with the cultivation of students, then all British people would have to become scholars. Reason: Smoking is an extremely common phenomenon in England.

A person who doesn't smoke does indeed have many difficulties coming to London. This is not to say that not smoking makes it impossible to be a gentleman. England not only has gentlemen who don't smoke, but they even organized a "No Smoking Society." The difficulty lies in encountering "cigarette smoke" everywhere. Not only on the streets, trams, subways, pubs, and cafes, but even in cinemas, theaters, and concerts, these gentlemen and ladies all smoke their cigarettes as much as possible. Sometimes, if you are unfortunate enough to sit next to a gentleman with a "cigarette addiction," you will have the opportunity to watch him smoke one cigarette after another. Especially many young girls love to do this. Even the British themselves find this phenomenon unpleasant. Recently, members of the "No Smoking Society" held a special meeting and petitioned the government to prohibit audiences from smoking in cinemas, theaters, and concerts. As a result, the British newspapers started a major discussion about the smoking issue. Some newspapers said that non-smokers seem to be in the minority. Since the majority of the audience wants to smoke, then the minority has no reason to force the majority. This newspaper said that the smoking issue is also closely related to business. Cinema owners have no way to stop the audience if the audience likes to smoke. Otherwise, their business will suffer losses. That newspaper said that smoking also has a harmonizing effect. Because many British films and dramas cannot be watched without smoking to pass the time and distract the mind, it is simply impossible to sit in the theater. Finally, another newspaper proposed imitating the New York cinema method, which is that smoking is allowed upstairs, but not downstairs. Naturally, this is a good compromise method, but whether it will work is still a question. Because this smoking habit, which has almost become a custom, is probably not easy to change for a while.

The opposite is true in Germany. Smoking is not allowed in German cinemas and theaters. There are also considerable restrictions on smoking in public places, especially for women. If a German woman occasionally smokes in public, she is often subject to "public opinion sanctions" from men. There is a popular saying in Germany: "German women do not smoke." I remember once hearing a man in his thirties warn a fashionable woman at a train station: "German women do not smoke." But the smoking woman calmly turned around and said: "I am Swiss. What does German women have to do with me, you say?" ㊁ Another joke. It is said that one day, a German lady was smoking in a cafe. Her behavior immediately aroused the displeasure of several men. One of the male customers volunteered to write a note saying "German women do not smoke" and sent it to the lady as a warning. The lady added a few words to the note and immediately returned it to him. When they opened it and read it, everyone was silent. It turned out that the lady replied, "German men only have wives, not mistresses!"

Two years ago, the youth of the National Socialist Party not only strongly supported the slogan "German women do not smoke," but also had the determination to make it a reality. Later, because of the wife of Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, who was a smoking female comrade, the slogan was finally abolished. In German social circles, many foreigners love to joke with German ladies about the smoking issue. When they refuse to smoke, they say: "German wives (the German word "Frau" has both the meanings of woman and wife) do not smoke, but you are a German Miss!"

### Jiaying Steamer Arrives in Shanghai with Rice, Unloading to Be Handled Today

Rice Traders Send Representatives to Take Charge of Matters

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company have jointly purchased foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply. The first batch of 25,000 bags of rice aboard the Jiaying Steamer arrived in Shanghai the night before last. Due to incomplete procedures, unloading is scheduled for today. The details are as follows:

Dispatching Representatives to Preside – The Rice Traders Association has designated 500 member rice shops to receive foreign rice from the Municipal Council for retail sales to maintain the food supply. The association has dispatched members Huang Ruquan, Su Boxun, Gu Yuqing, etc., along with staff, to be responsible for handling the rice receipt procedures. The Public Concession and French Concession police will each send 20 Chinese constables to protect the vehicles.

Unloading Rice Today – The Jiaying Steamer of the British Swire Company, carrying 25,000 bags of Saigon rice, arrived in Shanghai the night before last and is anchored in the Jiang River outside the French Avenue Bund. Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd., a British firm at 181 Jiangxi Road, which directly ordered from Saigon, is scheduled to send staff to the pier today, displaying a banner with the words "Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd.," to handle the unloading and transportation of the rice. Barges will be used to unload the rice from the Jiaying Steamer and transport it to the Bund on Second Horse Road, where it will be loaded onto trucks and transported to various shops for retail sales.

### Songjiang Compatriots Relief Association Cables Provincial Authorities to Allocate Funds for Relief

Over 50,000 Refugees on the Verge of Starvation – Saving the People with Poverty Relief Funds

The Relief Committee of the Songjiang Sojourners Association in Shanghai has sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request the allocation of funds to actively raise funds to relieve refugees from Songjiang who have sought refuge in Shanghai. Yesterday, it also submitted a petition to the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to allocate the remaining 30,000 yuan from the Songjiang County grain reserve to provide relief to the disaster victims. The original petition stated, "Since the August 13th Resistance Against Japan, Songjiang, being close to Shanghai, has been ravaged by the enemy. In mid-March, it was bombed hundreds of times, with over a thousand bombs dropped. The flourishing markets have been turned into scorched earth. The surviving people are displaced and homeless, suffering from hunger and cold, crying out to the heavens without response. Although we have tried our best to raise donations and find ways to provide relief, since the entire county was captured on the 8th of this month, the people have risked their lives to escape the disaster. Those who have asked the way to Shanghai number over 50,000, living in the open and exposed to the elements, on the verge of starvation. Their inhuman lives are unbearable to witness. Therefore, we implore your Excellency, with your compassionate heart for those who are hungry and drowning, to save these people who are in deep distress. Please allocate the remaining 30,000 yuan from the Songjiang County grain reserve to provide relief to the disaster victims of Songjiang. Using local funds to save the local people, using poverty relief funds to meet the urgent needs of disaster relief, the names are consistent and the uses are appropriate, so that the people know that the government has a sincere intention to love the people, and unity will be strengthened from now on, so that they will not be instigated by the enemy. The local area will be fortunate, and the refugees will be fortunate."

### Fire Once Broke Out in the Refugee Area on the Republic Road

Fire Was Extremely Fierce – Burning for Four Hours

Yesterday at 8:50 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the area of the Baohhetang Chinese Pharmacy on the Republic Road (opposite Jixiang Road in the French Concession). Smoke filled the air, and the situation was extremely fierce. After the French Concession authorities received the news, they immediately dispatched multiple fire trucks to extinguish the fire. However, due to the extremely fierce fire, it was not extinguished until around 12:00 noon.

### Hospitals Established in Refugee Areas

Medical Supplies Needed

After the guard and sanitation matters in the refugee area of Nanshi were handled, the Chinese Medical Association recently established a general hospital and a maternity hospital in the area, providing free medical treatment. The health of the refugees has been guaranteed. Because they are suffering from hunger and cold, many suffer from abdominal pain and diarrhea. There are many people seeking treatment, but the hospital only has 100 beds, which is not enough. Therefore, they are trying to expand and add more beds, and are requesting donations of medicines and equipment from the outside world. The registration of residents in the area is also underway. It is estimated that there are 50,000 households and about 70,000 refugees in the area. The former can be self-sufficient, but there is no way to buy rice and firewood in the area, so they also rely on the relief association's relief. Currently, 500,000 to 600,000 loaves of bread are transported in daily, which costs a lot. Therefore, the association is also trying to transport rice and firewood in for sale to reduce the burden. As for the negotiations to expand the refugee area, they are still under discussion.

According to news from the International Relief Association, in the refugee area of Nanshi, due to the cold weather recently, the refugees are thinly clad, resulting in a large number of people suffering from illness and moaning on the ground. Many have died without receiving treatment. The association has established a temporary hospital in the area to provide diagnosis and treatment at any time. However, due to the large number of people, there is a severe shortage of medicines. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will quickly donate generously to save the dying refugees.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Line Resumes Navigation as Usual

De Ping to Leave for Ningbo This Afternoon – One Trip Every Other Day Thereafter

Since the blockade of Zhenhai Port, Ningbo-bound ships have been prohibited from sailing since the 17th. For days, the Ningbo Sojourners Association has been sending telegrams to Ningbo, requesting the local Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the Zhenhai Fortress Headquarters. As a result, resumption of navigation has been approved. The De Ping of the Huayi Shipping Company in Shanghai is allowed to leave Shanghai for Ningbo as usual at 3:00 PM today. In the future, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been temporarily permitted by the Fortress Headquarters to operate as usual, as agreed upon by the Sojourners Association, etc. However, when the ship arrives at Zhenhai Port, the Fortress Headquarters must send a pilot to guide it into the port, and it must not enter on its own. However, in case of necessity, the Fortress Headquarters may still order the suspension of navigation at any time. Currently, the De Ping of the Huayi Company will operate one trip every other day to transport refugees to Ningbo.

### Refugees Suffering from Hunger and Cold – Various Charitable Organizations Actively Providing Relief

Guangyu Society Broadcasts – Pleads for Refugees

The Disaster Relief Association of charitable organizations in Shanghai, in view of the fact that there are still many refugees wandering on the streets and in various alleys who have not yet been accommodated, and at this cold time, it is often heard that such people are dying from hunger and cold while sleeping in the streets, the association dispatched a large number of vehicles to various places yesterday to take in refugees, totaling more than 100 people. There were also several corpses, all elderly people, who were handed over for burial. The entire staff of the Guangyu Society, Huang Chilin, Xia Hesheng, Chen Ruilin, etc., in view of the large number of refugees in Shanghai and the difficulty in providing for them, specially broadcast a special program on the Oriental Radio Station on Yuchaqing Road from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM every day, pleading for generous relief from all walks of life for the refugees. However, those from all walks of life who generously donate money, goods, or warm clothes and quilts are requested to send them directly to the relief agencies for acceptance.

The Shanghai Office of the China Lǐ Religion General Association held a joint meeting yesterday, chaired by Zhang Yichen. They discussed: ㊀ The Shanghai Fushuntang Guild Hall, led by Ren Xipeng, established eight shelters. Please review and request that personnel be sent to provide guidance. The resolution was to approve the record and send Commissioner Pu Yusheng to inspect. ㊁ The Shanghai Puyuandang Guild Hall reported that in addition to the three floors of the guild hall being used to accommodate refugees from five counties, including Dantu, it is self-operating a shelter on the second floor. Please review. The resolution was to approve the record. ㊂ The case of establishing a shelter on Beijing Road by the association was resolved to send staff member Zhang Yinglong to be responsible for handling it. ㊃ The Wuxi China Lǐ Religion Women and Children Relief Association sent a letter reporting the establishment situation. Please notify all Lǐ Religion guild halls. The resolution was to pass it. ㊄ The Gansu Jingyuan Zhiyi Hall Guild Hall sent a letter requesting registration. The resolution was to reply by letter with an attached form. ㊅ The Rugao Faxintang Guild Hall sent a letter setting a date for establishment and requesting that local agencies be transferred to protect the case. The resolution was to approve it.

The Young Women's Christian Association at 999 Jing'an Temple Road once established a shelter for women and children refugees at the Sino-Western Second Elementary School. Later, because the elementary school opened, it had to close down. It then planned to find another address to establish a shelter for unemployed women. However, because the address has not yet been found, the plan has not been realized yet. It was decided to move the boarding house in Yuqing Lane on Roberts Road to be part of the shelter, which can accommodate 40 to 50 people. In a few days, the quota was full. The association has sent people to teach handicrafts, sewing, and the production of special nutritious soybean milk, etc., and to introduce jobs to enable them to support themselves. In addition, the association raised a large number of old clothes and distributed them to the refugees. In recent days, a total of 914 old clothes have been distributed to eight refugee shelters, including the 3rd, 31st, 71st, 93rd, 97th, New World, Buddhist Jingye Society, and Baowang. It also sent ten bags of flour and 100 cotton vests to the refugees in Nanshi. It will continue to distribute in the future and actively seek wide empty houses or squares as places to accommodate unemployed women. It is hoped that all circles will help in the search. Those who have houses are requested to notify the association immediately.

The Jiangyin Sojourners Association in Shanghai has sent more than 200 fellow villagers back to their hometowns. Due to inconvenient transportation, there are still many fellow villagers stranded in Shanghai. In addition to actively trying to send them back as much as possible, those who are more miserable and unable to make a living are sent directly to the Zhi Sheng Shan Yuan for temporary accommodation to avoid sleeping on the streets and suffering from wind and rain.

### Charcoal Industry Asks Authorities of Two Concessions to Negotiate for the Release of Cargo Ships from Nanshi

Extreme Shortage of Charcoal – If No Measures Are Taken to Extract it, the People Will Run Out of Food and Social Peace Will Be Affected

The Shanghai Charcoal Industry Association wrote to the authorities of the two concessions this morning, saying, "According to members Guangseng, Yongda, Jinmaoji, and other charcoal firms, we have purchased charcoal from various mountainous areas in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in Zhejiang Province, and transported it to Shanghai to provide relief, as instructed by your association. Later, due to the westward movement of our troops, the subsequent batches of cargo ships were blocked on the Pujiang River near the Nanshi Water Plant and Qiuxin Factory, totaling more than a dozen ships, worth millions. When our troops withdrew, these cargo ships were even more unable to pass through. At this time of extreme shortage of charcoal, if no measures are taken to extract it, the people of this city will inevitably run out of food. We request that your association send letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession Authority to quickly take measures to negotiate with the Japanese side for early release to meet the essential needs of the residents of the area and maintain peace," etc. Charcoal is an essential fuel for the daily use of the people and cannot be cut off for a single day. It is of great importance to the livelihood of the people and social peace. Therefore, we hereby request your bureau to investigate and approve the rapid negotiation with the Japanese side to release the detained cargo ships as soon as possible to meet civilian needs. We will be immensely grateful.

### Transportation Not Resolved, Factories Still Difficult to Resume Work

Concession Authorities Can Provide Practical Assistance – All Difficulties Will Be Easily Solved

In order to promote the early resumption of work in various factories for the purpose of settling refugees, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession sent Mr. Heder, the head of the Industrial Section, to negotiate with the Shanghai West United Welfare Association and expressed its willingness to do its utmost to provide practical assistance. After investigation by the association, as the war has moved inward in recent days, all areas of the city have returned to a safe state, and the factories have indeed begun to prepare to resume work one after another. However, the most serious and difficult problem at present is the transportation problem. It is found that several British-owned textile factories have been operating for many days and producing a lot. Recently, due to the interruption of transportation and the lack of sources, they will temporarily stop work. In addition, the Chinese-owned Fuxin Tobacco Company, which opened day and night shifts ten days ago to rush the production of mountain goods, was still worried that it would not meet the demand, but now it also has to reduce the number of shifts due to inconvenient transportation and the inability to transport the inventory out of the port, and a large number of workers have been laid off. In addition, there are also factories that have resumed part of their work, and there are also those who are watching and hesitating, all because the transportation problem has not been resolved, which makes them hesitate and hesitate. It is now learned that the chairman of the association, Zhuang Ping, is scheduled to visit Mr. Heder within days to discuss everything, and believes that the transportation and raw material problems should be assisted by the Municipal Council and given a practical guarantee. Then all difficulties can be easily solved, and all factories can resume work uniformly.

### Chamber of Commerce Asks Zhejiang Provincial Government to Issue Passports for Rice Purchasing in Taiwan

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, saying, "To the Zhejiang Provincial Government, according to a letter from the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, according to a letter from our member Changyiheng Bank, since the war in this city moved westward, the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, Songjiang, and western Zhejiang have been turned into war zones, resulting in the disappearance of sources. The people's food supply in this city is worrying. It is now found that the transportation in Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, is still convenient, and this year's harvest there is also abundant, with a lot of surplus rice. We dare to ask your association to transfer the request to your association to prepare a document and submit it to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for review and approval, and immediately issue 10,000 passports to Taizhou to purchase rice for dispatching personnel to purchase and transport it to this city to relieve the people's food supply, etc. We hereby urgently transfer the request to your association to issue a certificate immediately and transfer it to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to issue a document for 10,000 passports for purchasing and transporting rice to Taizhou, so that it can be transported to Shanghai to relieve the people's food supply, which is really a great convenience," etc. The association, after checking, found that the transportation between this city and western Zhejiang and Jiangsu has been cut off, and the supply of rice is almost exhausted. It can only rely on the foreign rice stored in the Municipal Council for retail sales, which is difficult to rely on as a permanent inexhaustible source. According to the situation in the letter, it is really an urgent rescue plan. It is reasonable to telegram your government for review and approval, and to issue a passport for Changyi Bank to purchase 10,000 bags of rice in Taiwan to facilitate transportation and relieve the people's food supply, which is really a public convenience. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows.

The Fire in Nanshi Has Been Burning for Five Days – More Than 100 Houses Destroyed in Pudong

Nanshi: Nanshi has suffered arson and burning for the second time, and it has been five days since the fire spread to as many as 14 places. At night, the fire tongue is transparent, and the sky is red. Although the wind and rain have been miserable for days, the fire is no less than the last big fire. The burning was most intense in the previous two nights. The fire that spread along Huangjia Que Road has burned into two places westward along the way, a total of one southwest burned from Daji Road, straight to the Public Sports Field and Women and Children Hospital. The area along the road has become scorched earth. Ai Qun Girls' Middle School, Shangde Elementary School, and Shanghai South First Elementary School have all been burned down. Again, westward from Chunsen Lumber Company, it burned to the Cuitai Pawnshop on Zhonghua Road, Ximen. However, the Xiqu Fire Station, where the Japanese army once stationed its headquarters the day before yesterday, was also burned down the night before last, leaving only the cement shell. In the city, the fire in Jinjiafang on Fangbang Road has burned eastward to the periphery of Shipinong, and one end has penetrated Kongjia Lane along the Republic Road. The fire is still burning fiercely. The fire on Jingtin Road, Dadongmen, has been heading west and will soon reach the vicinity of Xun Dao Street and Qiaojia Road. The fire in front of Guangfu Temple has been burning eastward. The Wangjia Wharf and Dada Wharf area on the Bund are still raging. The fires in Dananmen and Xiaonanmen have been slightly quelled. Other places such as Penglai Road, Wenmiao Road, and Xicang Road are still burning severely.

Pudong: Yesterday, the weather turned sunny. In Pudong, around 9:00 AM, three tongues of fire extended again. One was near the garbage pond at the north end of Zhongshi, Yangjiadu. The fire was extremely fierce, and a thick smoke rose into the sky. Because no one was there to rescue it, it gradually died down around 1:00 PM. About 50 or 60 houses were destroyed. Another fire broke out near Laobaidu. The fire was slightly less than Yangjiadu, but it also burned for a long time, until it weakened around 2:00 PM. More than 40 houses were destroyed. There was also a fire in the eastern end of Shenjia Nong's Dongshi End. The area was relatively deserted and close to the countryside. There were very few houses connected to each other, but the burning time was also more than three hours. It is estimated that more than 30 houses were destroyed. Around 0:00 PM in the afternoon, the Xiyangjiazhai at the eastern end of Tongxing Street, Lujiazhai Road, and the Dongyangjiazhai at the south end of the Tianzhang Paper Factory both ignited flames one after another. The burning was fierce. Because the bungalows were closely packed together, the fire spread quite widely. After about two hours of burning, the total number of houses destroyed in both places was more than 100.

According to Ji's confession, the deceased previously opened the Yelai Xiang Tour Agency at No. 9 Yuren Lane, Yunnan Road, and hired him as an accountant, stating that the monthly salary would be 15 yuan, but a deposit of 60 yuan was required. Ji paid the full amount. However, after starting the job, due to poor business, no salary was paid. Later, Lu closed Yelai Xiang and opened the Liuguo Tour Agency on Yu Qiaqing Road, which also failed shortly after and was moved to the scene of the incident, renamed Mima Dianma. Ji followed him all the time, managing money. Recently, Lu Fusheng not only did not pay Ji's due wages, but also planned to drive Ji away, leading to frequent quarrels. On the morning of the 19th, another dispute occurred. Ji, in anger, struck Lu's head several times with the lid of a stove, causing serious injuries and death. He was sent to the Special First Court yesterday morning, and the police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered a postponement of the trial.

### Gu Zhuxuan Case Retrial

Court Hearing on the 29th of This Month

Gu Zhuxuan from Yancheng, the former owner of the Tianchan Stage, was previously implicated in the case of instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, based on the accusation of the convicted murderer Zhao Guangfu, who was arrested. The French police arrested Gu and sent him to the Special Second Court, where he was prosecuted for murder. After trial, Gu was sentenced to 15 years in prison and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights. Because Gu did not agree, he appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The result of the trial was that the original judgment was revoked and he was declared not guilty. During the appeal period, he was still detained in the detention center. Later, because the French Police Department disagreed with the second instance judgment, they petitioned the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. Later, Gu requested the Third Branch of the High Court to stop the detention, and it was ruled that he could be released on bail with a cash deposit of 7,000 yuan, plus a guarantee of 10,000 yuan that he would be available whenever summoned, and three jointly and severally liable guarantors. The Supreme Court has reviewed the entire case file and believes that there are many doubts in the case that have not been clarified. Therefore, the second instance judgment was revoked and the entire case file was sent back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. As reported in this newspaper, it is now known that the case has been handled by Judge Wang Yue of the Criminal Court of the Third Branch of the High Court. After reviewing the case file and the reasons for the Supreme Court's judgment, it is heard that subpoenas have been issued, and the court hearing is scheduled for the 29th of this month to summon Gu Zhuxuan and the Chinese and foreign detectives of the French Police Department who handled the case to the court for investigation and questioning.

If these methods can be effectively implemented, theft cases will surely be reduced.

### Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association Concerned About Hometown News

### Renji Hospital's October Report

Renji Hospital's October report states: 17,004 outpatient visits, 589 inpatients, 8,273 inpatient days, an average of 570 people fed per day, 15 male suicides, 23 female suicides, 195 inpatient surgeries, 261 outpatient surgeries, 10 factory accidents and injuries, 467 patients sent by the Public Concession Police Station, 17 patients sent by the French Concession Police Station, 13 patients sent by the Chinese Public Security Bureau, 42 deliveries, 17,593 prescriptions, 488 X-ray photographs, 5,161 total inpatient days, and 1,635 total outpatient visits.

The refugee problem in October had a significant impact on the hospital's work. It can be imagined from the fact that there are already 70,000 to 80,000 refugees in the refugee camps, and those living elsewhere are not included. It is reported that many refugees in the refugee camps are seriously ill and need to be hospitalized for treatment, but the bed facilities in all hospitals in the Shanghai Concession are not sufficient to accommodate all of them. The number of beds occupied by the hospital every day is about 375 or more, but the hospital is only a hospital with 230 beds. Therefore, the hospital had to set up temporary beds in various departments for accommodation, and the hospital's important problem is no longer whether there are empty beds, but whether there is floor space to set up these temporary beds.

The number of free inpatient days was more than 5,161 days, and there were 1,625 free outpatient visits. The hospital is very grateful to the Shanghai Red Cross Society for donating funds for this work. The average donation for each inpatient was 50 cents, and the donation for each outpatient was 5 cents.

The increase in inpatients is due to the fact that surgical treatments for inpatients have increased by almost 20%. The hospital's obstetrics department continued to make progress, with 42 deliveries in October, a new record for the hospital. Last month's record was 39. Summer illnesses have decreased, but illnesses caused by the hardships of the previous three months have increased. Malnutrition has been found in both internal and surgical patients. The food that poor patients eat in normal times is only enough to maintain their health on the horizontal line, and at present, the deterioration of food has serious consequences. If they had been well-nourished, the diseases they developed would have been very minor.

Among the useful donations received this month was an iron medical box, which is now placed in the emergency department. In the event of an emergency injury, the box can be carried to the scene. The box can hold first-aid bandages and medicines. This box was donated by Miss Adelaime through fundraising for three friends. It has been used several times in October. In addition, the hospital received various donations and supplies. The names of the donors are listed below to express our gratitude: Mrs. Stock, Mrs. Uliston, Mrs. Yang (transliteration), Reid School of the China Inland Mission (fundraised by Miss Barton), Mrs. Hammond, colleagues of the Renji Hospital Women's Assistant Team, the YWCA, Miss Zhuang (transliteration), colleagues of the Western staff of the Continental Daily News, Rev. E.G. Ottewcll, Mrs. Liddell of the China Women's Association, the Christian Women's Association (Leeds Women's Guild of Ohristiau Serviee), Dr. A.O. Price.

### Wang Wenyu and Si Yigui Perform in Rigoletto

The Shanghai Opera House at the Jardin Dancing Hall on Rue Lafayette will perform the opera Rigoletto, a masterpiece by the French composer Offenbach, tonight. Admiring the names of our Chinese singing masters, Mrs. Wang Wenyu and Si Yigui, they were invited to join the singing. Mrs. Wang Wenyu is from Guangdong and has studied Western opera for many years. Her singing voice is excellent and unparalleled. She plays the role of Gilda in the play, which is very demanding in singing and acting. Si Yigui grew up in Shanghai and has always been well-cultivated. He has performed in Shanghai's string orchestras several times and enjoys a great reputation. This collaboration is a perfect match, and it is especially rare to sing in Italian. To regulate the spirit of the Shanghai people, the prices are very cheap, ranging from 50 cents to 3 yuan. Seats can be reserved at the Robison Company at 276 Jiangxi Road.

Current Commentary

### Balance of Power and Isolation

— Yi

Historically, China has been able to gradually develop in modern times by relying on the balance of power among the great powers. In recent years, Japan's blatant acts of aggression have awakened the awareness of our entire nation to fight for self-reliance. At the same time, it has also broken the balance of power among the great powers in China. The result of the former is the current large-scale full-scale war of resistance. The result of the latter is that Japan is in a position of isolation.

The establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan seems to be able to save Japan from its painful state of isolation. In fact, even if the strengths of Germany, Italy, and Japan are combined, they are far from being able to match the strength of all peaceful countries. Moreover, the interests of the three countries are different. It is still doubtful whether this combination can last for a long time. At present, Japan can certainly use this pact as a weapon to make the peaceful countries of the world afraid of the expansion of war and maintain a wait-and-see attitude towards China's fate. But can this situation remain unchanged?

I think change is bound to come. Recently, British diplomatic activities have had significant success in Europe. The Spanish issue is about to be resolved due to the Soviet Union's concession. The meeting between Halifax and Hitler is said to have been very satisfactory. Obviously, Britain's efforts are to stabilize the European situation and prevent it from being affected by the war in the Far East. If this goal can be achieved, the European and American powers can use their full strength to deal with the crisis in the Far East.

In any case, the crisis in the Far East is something that the European and American powers cannot ignore. Japan's use of the Anti-Comintern Pact to relieve its own painful isolation may not be very effective.
