[Beiping] The Lugouqiao Incident has been preliminarily resolved. This morning at 5 AM, our side dispatched Lin Gengyu and the Japanese side dispatched Advisor Nakajima to negotiate at Lugouqiao. At the time, Wanping City was still surrounded by layers of Japanese troops. Between Wanping City and Lugouqiao, the Japanese army had established a total of four lines of defense. Lin and Nakajima passed through these four lines of defense to reach the Japanese army headquarters at Lugouqiao, where they met with Brigade Commander Kawabe and Regiment Commander Muta, who were directing the Japanese army's operations. It was then decided that the Japanese army would retreat to the vicinity of the headquarters at Lugouqiao, lifting the siege of Wanping. Our side's cavalry units would temporarily return to their original defenses, and Wanping County and nearby areas would be defended by security forces. This afternoon, the above decision was implemented. Administrative Commissioner Wang Lengzhai is stationed in Wanping City, handling various aftermath matters. Accurate statistics on our casualties are not yet available. The bodies of soldiers and civilians killed in Wanping City have mostly been buried by the authorities, and the remaining names are being investigated and will be buried within days.

Zhang and Matsui will meet with Chinese and Japanese military officers. (9th Dispatch)

### The Process of Negotiation and Resolution Between the Two Sides

[Tianjin] The Lugouqiao Incident has been initially resolved, and the Chinese and Japanese armies have withdrawn separately. Chief of Staff Hashimoto Gun of the Japanese Garrison Army and Staff Officer Tsukada took a train from Tianjin to Fengtai at 4 PM on the 9th, transferred to a car to Ping, and negotiated the aftermath issues, which are expected to be resolved peacefully. After this incident occurred, most of our local officials were in Ping, while the focus of the Japanese side was in Tianjin. Tashiro was ill, and his commander's position was taken over by Hashimoto. Therefore, all negotiations were conducted simultaneously in Ping and Tianjin. In Beiping, Qin Dechun, Zhang Zizhong, Feng Zhian, Zhang Yunrong, and others contacted Wachi, a staff officer of the Japanese garrison army, and military attache Imai at any time. Here, Secretary General of the Municipal Government Ma Yanchong and Police Chief Li Wentian negotiated everything with Chief of Staff Hashimoto of the Japanese garrison army and Staff Officer Tsukada from 5 PM on the evening of the 8th. Both sides expressed their unwillingness to expand the situation, so the negotiations proceeded smoothly. First, after the conflict between the armies of the two sides, the Japanese side immediately occupied the Dragon King Temple and outside Wanping City, and took an offensive against us. A battalion of our army stationed in Wanping City was forced to disperse and resist. By the time the two sides agreed on a solution, the first step was to eliminate hostile acts, and then discuss other details. Our side insisted that the Japanese soldiers attacking the city must withdraw immediately, but the Japanese side insisted that if the troops were to withdraw, both sides must implement it simultaneously, given the current hostile acts. There was much dispute over this point. The two sides repeatedly asked for instructions from their superiors and negotiated all night until 4 AM on the morning of the 9th, when it was agreed that the Japanese side would withdraw the troops attacking the city to their original training location, and our army stationed in the city would also be temporarily transferred to a village about two li west of Wanping City for temporary stationing, and another security team would be sent to maintain order in the city. , so that the hostile acts of both parties can be resolved during this transition period, and then return to normal. On the morning of the 9th, when our security team, Shi Yusan's troops, took five or six heavy-duty trucks to take over the defense, the Japanese garrison opened fire again, which almost caused another incident. After the authorities of both sides explained, the security team had arrived to take over the defense. According to the authorities here, the Chinese and Japanese armies also withdrew separately in the afternoon. What is being negotiated in Ping now is the issue of all the aftermaths. Therefore, Hashimoto, Tsukada, and others went to Ping at 4 PM to continue negotiations. According to general observations, this matter is expected to be resolved smoothly. According to relevant sources, the Japanese side did not make any demands during the negotiations in Tianjin. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Japanese Cabinet Decides on Countermeasures for the Lugouqiao Incident

Adhere to the Policy of Not Expanding the Incident; Foreign Minister Instructs Ambassador Kawagoe to Lodge a Protest

[Tokyo] At 8:00 PM last night, news of the breakdown of negotiations in Beiping caused a sudden state of tension here. At 7:00 AM this morning, news came that as a result of continued negotiations last night, both sides agreed to begin withdrawing troops simultaneously at 6:00 AM this morning and conduct further diplomatic negotiations. The general feeling was that the situation might ease. However, at 9:00 AM, news came that the two sides had started shooting again and were engaged in fierce fighting, and the situation became tense again. At 8:00 AM, the Army Headquarters held an important discussion, and at 10:00 AM, the Cabinet held a meeting to decide on countermeasures. It is most noteworthy that the Japanese government and military headquarters still stated the policy of non-expansion. This morning, all newspapers published editorials on the Lugouqiao incident, generally hoping that the situation would not escalate. The Asahi Shimbun stated that Japan should be prepared to cooperate in resolving the situation depending on China's sincerity. This is only natural, considering Japan's sincere efforts to promote the London talks. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

However, future diplomatic negotiations will still be difficult, and whether the Japanese army will immediately return to Fengtai is still a question. However, the most dangerous period should have passed. People in Tokyo are very calm, but security has been increased outside our embassy. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

The spokesperson replied that it was for training. Another question was whether it was true that the Japanese army occupied the Lugouqiao station and airfield. The spokesperson replied that he had not received a report. Even if they were occupied, it would only be temporary. Another question was whether the Japanese government intended to protest to the National Government. The spokesperson replied that it had not been decided. Finally, the spokesperson said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instructed Hinokuma, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in China, to request the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protect Japanese residents in China. Many foreign reporters attended this morning, which proves that the incident has attracted worldwide attention. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

### A Certain Faction's Conspiracy Organization Cracked in Northern Henan

Reactionary Propaganda Found; Headquarters Located in the Japanese Concession of Tianjin

[Zhengzhou] A certain faction secretly organized the "One Heart Dao" (i.e., the Long-Haired Bandits) in northern Henan. Many villagers were seduced by it. The garrison troops in Anyang cracked down on fake organizations in Dongguan and Huangkou Village in the western countryside, and arrested twelve people including the leaders Feng Tianhe and Su Xin.

Ju Zheng presided over the ceremony and then gave a speech entitled "Self-Confidence is the Basis of Restoration," stating that for thousands of years, the Chinese nation has aimed to complete the unification of the country and realize a world of Great Harmony. This is also the unique self-confidence of our nation. In the year when the Revolutionary Army swore in for the Northern Expedition, because the power of our party had not yet reached the whole country, General Commander Chiang Kai-shek was ordered to lead the three armies and swear in for the Northern Expedition. As the army advanced, it won victories one after another, and finally completed the great cause of the revolution. This victory was based on the strong self-confidence of the National Government, General Commander Chiang Kai-shek, and the revolutionary masses. In the future, we should further promote this self-confidence, not be afraid of the strong, and thoroughly eliminate all evil forces that hinder the revolution. At the same time, we should develop construction so that people across the country can enjoy the happiness that modern human beings should enjoy. The meeting adjourned at 7:20 AM.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Partition Plan for Palestine

— Bin

The report of the Palestine Royal Commission was released the day before yesterday. The report states that the Jewish and Arab nations cannot be assimilated and advocates dividing Palestine into three zones: ㊀ the Arab zone to be merged into Transjordan, ㊁ the Jewish zone, and ㊂ the British-mandated zone to include Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Nazareth, with the right to protect the holy sites in the Arab and Jewish zones. In addition, it stipulates that the Arab zone can receive £2 million in assistance from the Jewish zone and the United Kingdom. After the report was released, although the British bourgeois newspapers unanimously agreed, considering it "the best and most hopeful method to resolve the Palestinian stalemate," both the Arab and Jewish nations were aroused, expressing firm opposition because they both understand that this proposal is merely a new shackle to bind them, not a key to liberation.

Palestine is a narrow and long area on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean. Since the Balfour Declaration was issued in 1917 and General Allenby led troops to occupy it, it has been under British rule for twenty years. The Treaty of Sèvres, signed by the Allies with Turkey in 1920, listed Palestine as a Class A mandated territory of Britain. But in reality, Palestine is the same as a Class B mandated territory. All legislative and administrative powers are entirely in the hands of the mandated power, which is no different from becoming a British colony. Therefore, the Arabs, who account for more than 80% of the population of Palestine, often launch anti-British imperialist movements. In order to consolidate its rule, Britain cleverly adopted a divide-and-rule policy, trying its best to contact the Zionist, continuously transferring Jews into Palestine, and allowing them to establish "Jewish Palestine" to oppress Arab laborers. This causes frequent conflicts between Arabs and Jews, from which Britain can benefit. Therefore, Zionists are no different from a tool for British rule in Palestine.

In recent years, Arab-Jewish conflicts have emerged one after another, such as the anti-Jewish movement in 1929 and the "Wailing Wall" incident in 1931, which are the two most famous. But Palestine's national movement still cannot be stopped. Moreover, Arab-Jewish conflicts often lead to anti-British movements. Last May, after the Arab-Jewish conflict, an anti-British movement broke out, which was suppressed by British military force until October. Last July, when the anti-British movement was at its most intense, Britain sent a Royal Commission to Palestine to investigate because they deeply felt the threat of the Arab national movement and felt that the past policies were no longer applicable and had to be changed to consolidate their rule. Now, after a year of research by the Royal Commission, they have come up with this plan to divide Palestine.

This plan is undoubtedly a "masterpiece" of British imperialist politicians. It seems to have demarcated an independent country for the Arabs, but in reality, it is driving the Arabs to a corner to facilitate its suppression of the Arab national movement. It seems to be helping the Jews realize the dream of a "national home," but in reality, it is far from Britain's previous promises. Moreover, this plan stipulates that not only must the capital be controlled by Britain, but also all the best ports in Palestine, such as Haifa, Bethlehem, and Ras al-Nakura, are included in the mandated zone. This proves that everything is only beneficial to Britain.

Palestine has always been known as the "Suez Canal of the Air." Its position is very important in the connection between Britain and India and other colonies. The rise of the Arab national movement in recent years shows that British rule in Palestine has been shaken. This is naturally chilling to British politicians. Therefore, they want to change their ways to consolidate their rule. This kind of imperialist policy seems to be tolerant on the surface, but it is actually very poisonous. In the past, such as the promulgation of the new Indian constitution and the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, were all manifestations of this policy.

Now, both the Arab and Jewish nations are deeply dissatisfied with this plan to divide Palestine and have decided to fight with all their strength. Britain has also sent large troops, wanting to use force to force them to recognize it. In the near future, there may be another vigorous resistance movement in Palestine.

### Soviet Protest Against Japanese Army's Breach of Contract in Occupying Two Islands

Red Army Reinforces Far East Defenses; Full Resistance Against Enemy Incursions

[Moscow] Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, having learned that Japanese-Manchukuo troops had reoccupied two disputed islands on the Heilongjiang River, declared today that the Soviet Far East Army had received firm orders to resist with full force should Japanese-Manchukuo troops further intrude into Soviet territory. The Foreign Ministry considers the Soviet protest to be very "stern." Diplomatic circles believe that the Soviet warning, issued during the conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops in North China, is also worthy of great attention. (Eighth National Telegram)

[Moscow] According to diplomatic sources here, General Galen, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Far East Army, has summoned all corps commanders to a meeting in Khabarovsk next Tuesday. In the past few days, a total of thirty military aircraft have been dispatched to the eastern border of Siberia to strengthen defenses, while several gunboats have been ordered to patrol the Heilongjiang River. In addition, a large quantity of military supplies is en route to the Far East. (Ninth National Maritime Telegram)

[Moscow] After the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee received news on the 6th that a company of Japanese-Manchukuo troops had occupied Bolshoi Island on the Heilongjiang River, it immediately questioned the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union for an explanation. Unsatisfied with the response, Litvinov invited Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu for talks again on the 8th, lodging a protest stating that the dispute over the islands on the Heilongjiang River had nearly led to conflict a few days prior. Subsequently, the conflict was avoided as both sides agreed to withdraw troops stationed on the islands. At that time, the Soviet government insisted on simultaneous troop withdrawal, and the subsequent compliant withdrawal was because Your Excellency had formally declared that no Japanese-Manchukuo troops were stationed near the islands. The presence of the troops there at the beginning of the negotiations clearly proved that the garrison had been withdrawn during the negotiations. If the Soviet side had redeployed troops to the islands within two days of the withdrawal, it would have been a breach of contract by the Soviet side. Today, Japanese-Manchukuo troops have repeatedly appeared on the islands, proving that the breach of contract lies with the Japanese-Manchukuo side. On this point, the Soviet government lodges a firm protest. Your Excellency has repeatedly stated in negotiations that the status quo must be restored, which further proves that this protest is well-founded. Because Your Excellency claimed that there were no Japanese-Manchukuo troops on the islands, the current deployment of troops clearly constitutes a move to disrupt the status quo. As for the claim that the islands belong to Manchukuo, the Soviet Union absolutely cannot recognize it. Therefore, the Japanese-Manchukuo troops' garrisoning of the islands is clearly illegal. If the Japanese government, as Your Excellency stated, is sincere in maintaining peace and avoiding conflict, then the Soviet government sincerely hopes that the Japanese-Manchukuo troops currently stationed on the islands will withdraw immediately. The Japanese ambassador then added an explanation, still citing the islands' belonging to Manchukuo as the reason, and claiming that two or three Soviet gunboats had been patrolling near the islands. Litvinov found the explanation unsatisfactory and, based on the ideas he presented, asked the ambassador to convey the Soviet statement and protest to the Japanese government. Litvinov also asked the Japanese ambassador to bring to the Japanese government's attention the recent frequent incursions of Japanese-Manchukuo troops into Soviet territory and the repeated overflights of Soviet airspace by Japanese aircraft. Litvinov warned the ambassador that Soviet border guards had been ordered to resolutely prevent Japanese-Manchukuo troops from crossing into Soviet territory, and if found, to use all means to expel them. The Japanese ambassador then accused Soviet troops of crossing into Manchukuo territory, which Litvinov immediately refuted as inconsistent with the facts, pointing out that Japanese-Manchukuo troops had crossed into Soviet territory at Vinokaka Mountain a few days ago and were driven out by Soviet troops, leaving behind military supplies and bloodstains, proving that there were casualties among the Japanese-Manchukuo border crossing personnel, who were then taken back to Manchukuo territory. Litvinov finally informed the Japanese ambassador that the Soviet side intended to salvage the gunboat sunk by Manchukuo. (Ninth TASS Telegram)

### Four-Nation Non-Aggression Pact Signed in the Near East

Soviet Union Pursues Good Neighbor Policy; Turkish and Swedish Foreign Ministers Visit Russian Capital

Tehran – The foreign ministers of Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Turkey signed a four-nation non-aggression pact today at the Iranian King's summer villa. During a banquet hosted by the Iranian Prime Minister for the four foreign ministers, diplomats from all countries delivered speeches expressing their congratulations. Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü immediately departed for Moscow after signing. (Ninth National Maritime Telegram)

[Moscow] Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler arrived here today and was accompanied by Soviet Ambassador to Sweden, Madame Kollontai, to visit Foreign Minister Litvinov, who hosted him for lunch. Tomorrow, People's Committee Chairman Molotov will host a banquet at the Kremlin. Previously, Finnish Foreign Minister Holsti and Latvian Foreign Minister Munters had visited here in succession. Now, the Swedish Foreign Minister has also come to Moscow, and it is reported that Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü will also follow Sandler in visiting. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union intends to cultivate friendly relations with countries along the Baltic Sea, the Scandinavian Peninsula, and the Black Sea coast, thereby establishing a buffer zone to prevent the development of German power in Eastern and Northern Europe.

### Anglo-Russian and Anglo-German Naval Agreements

Postponed to Next Wednesday for Signing

[London] The Anglo-Russian and Anglo-German naval agreements, originally scheduled to be signed here tomorrow, have been postponed because the Soviet representative has not yet received full powers from his government. However, it is reported that there are no fundamental difficulties remaining in these two naval treaties, and the reason for the delay is that the Soviet government has stricter control over its foreign envoys than before. (Eighth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

[London] The Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet naval agreements, which have been under negotiation for several months, will be signed next Wednesday. Their content is based on the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, with qualitative restrictions. Relevant parties believe that a definite relationship will be established between Germany and the Soviet Union through the signing of these two naval agreements. According to the original proposal, the relative strength of Germany and Russia for "Type A" cruisers (i.e., cruisers with a displacement of 100,000 tons) was three to five. The current negotiations have changed it to five to seven. (Eighth National Maritime Telegram)

### New British Submarine Launched

[Paris] A new-type submarine, the Jizui, was launched today at the port of Cherbourg. The submarine has a displacement of 1,500 tons, a length of 92 meters, and can accommodate 220 sailors.

### Non-Intervention Committee Holds Meeting; Representatives Clarify Positions

French and Russian Views Conflict with Italian and German Views; Dutch Representative Prepares to Propose Compromise

[London] The Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Conflict held a plenary session this morning. Representatives from France, Italy, Portugal, Russia, and Germany all delivered speeches and elaborated their views. The meeting adjourned at 1:50 PM and is scheduled to resume discussions at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The Dutch representative, the Minister to the UK, Mr. Swinderen, is reportedly preparing to propose a compromise plan, the contents of which are unknown to outsiders, but British officials believe that it will be acceptable to the countries involved. (Ninth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

[London] During this morning's meeting of the Spanish War Non-Intervention Committee, French Ambassador to the UK, Corbin, stated that if the gaps in the maritime surveillance plan are not filled immediately, and the British supervisors on the Portuguese border remain suspended from their duties for a long time, France will inevitably cease international surveillance in the Pyrenees Mountains. No decisions were made on any major issues at this morning's meeting. The representatives of each country merely reiterated the views they had previously expressed in the subcommittee. After two and a half hours, the meeting adjourned. Corbin said that the gaps in the maritime surveillance plan can no longer be tolerated, while the representatives of Germany and Italy reiterated their request to grant belligerent rights to both sides in the Spanish war, while maintaining the remaining surveillance plan. The Portuguese representative stated that he agreed with the German and Italian methods in principle, while the Soviet Ambassador Maisky agreed with the proposals of Britain and France. Other representatives plan to continue speaking at the meeting this afternoon and discuss future directions, but it is feared that there will be no concrete resolutions. (Ninth Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)

[London] The Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Conflict Non-Intervention Measures held a plenary session at 11:15 this morning. The French representative, the Ambassador to the United States, Corbin, immediately delivered an important speech, criticizing the idea of recognizing both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerents, and stating that if the surveillance work on the land border between Portugal and Spain cannot be maintained as it was, France will open the Pyrenees Mountains in early next week and cease surveillance. If the parties in the Spanish war recognize each other as belligerents, the initial results would be international disputes on the Spanish seas and the disappearance of the spirit of neutrality, which would change the existing balance of power in the Spanish war to the benefit of the Nationalist forces. As things stand now, after the Nationalist forces obtain belligerent rights, they will inevitably blockade the coast of the Republic government in the Mediterranean, while the Republic government, even if it wants to blockade the coast of the Nationalist forces in the Atlantic, will not be able to do so. As for the current surveillance measures along the Portuguese-Spanish border, Portugal has already withdrawn from them. If they cannot be restored, the French government will notify the Adjustment Committee in early next week that international supervisors will not be allowed to continue performing their duties in the Pyrenees Mountains. He then mentioned the French government's proposal to dispatch neutral personnel to inspect on surveillance warships. "If the deployment of neutral personnel for inspection cannot be realized, then whether the non-intervention measures can be honestly implemented can only depend on the integrity of the countries responsible for surveillance and the captains of their warships. If this is effective, then even if the land border surveillance measures are abolished, it will be no problem. In short, the maritime surveillance plan cannot be completely abolished. Even if surveillance measures cannot be implemented at each port of arrival, each port of departure should still be monitored." Corbin concluded, "We still advocate maintaining the surveillance plan proposed by Britain and France, and are willing to consider other suggestions from other countries that can enrich this plan." (Ninth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

### Italian Representative Opposes British and French Proposals

Explains Four Reasons

[London] After the French representative delivered a speech at the plenary meeting of the Adjustment Committee, the Italian representative, the Ambassador to the UK, Grandi, read a lengthy speech to explain his country's reasons for opposing the new surveillance plan. The content is divided into four points: ㊀ Since Britain and France have not recognized the Spanish Nationalist government, the implementation of the new surveillance plan will only disrupt the existing balance of power and favor the Valencia city government. ㊁ If the relevant European countries do not declare neutrality towards the parties in the Spanish war in accordance with international law, then the dispatch of neutral personnel to inspect on surveillance warships has no meaning. ㊂ After the Spanish Valencia government deliberately violated the non-intervention agreement, the original maritime surveillance plan caused tragedy (referring to the incidents involving the German ships "Deutschland" and "Leipzig"). If the original surveillance plan is changed and implemented by Britain and France, it will be easier to cause accidents. ㊃ The maritime surveillance plan is of no use. There are many merchant ships belonging to Spain and European countries, and it is impossible to monitor them one by one. In order to maintain an effective surveillance plan, Italy and Germany advocate abolishing maritime surveillance work and maintaining other surveillance work. "The reason why the Italian government hopes to reconsider the current surveillance plan is not to change the principles, but to improve the implementation." As for the current surveillance work in the Pyrenees Mountains, although it cannot be considered satisfactory, the land border surveillance plan cannot be abandoned. As things stand now, the coast under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Nationalist forces is subject to maritime surveillance, while the coast under the jurisdiction of the government forces is not. This kind of abnormal system should not be allowed to continue. The task entrusted by the Adjustment Committee to Britain, France, Germany, and Italy has now expired, and Italy therefore advocates recognizing both parties in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents and declaring neutrality by the relevant countries in order to make up for the shortcomings of the current method.

### British Prime Minister's Speech Discusses Domestic and Foreign Situation

Welcomes German Foreign Minister to UK for Visit; Seeks Practical Improvement in Relations Between the Two Countries

[London] At a rally held by supporters of the National Cabinet in Albert Hall here tonight, Chamberlain delivered a speech, stating: "I firmly believe that if our country restores its military strength, as another peace-loving country across the Atlantic (referring to the United States) is doing, it will surely one day prompt the world to regain its senses and realize that all difficulties should be resolved through peaceful negotiations rather than through unilateral use of force." Chamberlain continued, "Since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, the British government has tried to limit the scope of the war and prevent it from expanding. However, the root cause of the Spanish war is a byproduct of the unstable situation in Europe. Unless we address the root cause, we must study this root cause." Chamberlain then brought up the proposal for German Foreign Minister Neurath to visit the UK. (See Havas's separate telegram for details.) Finally, Chamberlain reiterated the domestic situation in Britain, saying that some people claim that the current prosperity of British industry is only due to the stimulus of the expanded military equipment plan, but this is not the case. British trade was already thriving before the expansion of military equipment was implemented, which shows that economic recovery is not solely due to the expansion of military equipment.

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned the visit of German Foreign Minister Neurath to the UK in his speech at Albert Hall last night, saying, "The German Foreign Minister could have come to visit earlier, but unfortunately, due to various incidents, the trip was delayed. However, I personally believe that it is of great importance if important political figures from various countries can meet and treat each other, so I hope with all sincerity that the German Foreign Minister will have another opportunity to come to the UK to discuss various issues with us and gain a better understanding of each other's views." Parliamentary officials recently stated that the government is now planning to invite Neurath to visit here this autumn, as people here generally believe that Neurath is sufficient to represent the moderate opinions of the German government. If Anglo-German relations can be improved after visiting the UK, Neurath's position in the German government will inevitably be strengthened, and at the same time, German leader Hitler and his advisors can understand that if Germany adopts a cooperative policy, it will gain more benefits than adopting a threatening policy. For this reason, the Foreign Office is very willing for Neurath to visit the UK, believing that it will yield tangible results. In addition, parliamentary officials now also hope that Germany will not take hasty actions in Spain or Central Europe. (Eighth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

### Senior Vatican Official Visits Paris

French Newspapers Attach Great Importance

[Paris] Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pacelli presided over the opening ceremony of the "Vatican Pavilion" at the Paris International Exposition this morning. As Pacelli is a senior Vatican official, he is generally considered to be the successor to Pope Pius XI. Recently, the Pope issued a decree against the Nazi Party's religious policy, and Pacelli came to France at this time, so most newspapers attached great importance to him. The "Journal" commented that Cardinal Consalvi of the Vatican visited France in the early 19th century to discuss with Emperor Napoleon the Concordat between the Church and France. Since then, no head of the Vatican has visited France. Cardinal Pacelli's visit is a major event that has not happened in a century. In addition, many Catholic clergy from all over France are now gathered here to welcome the Vatican Secretary of State, the most important of whom is Father Khairallah, Abbot of the Benedictine Order, who recently met with State Council Associate Blum to discuss missionary issues in Far Eastern countries. As the French government is responsible for protecting Catholic missionaries in Far Eastern countries, this issue is of particular importance to France. (Ninth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

### French Government Issues Orders for New Financial Measures

Levy New Taxes to Make Up for Budget Shortfall; Strictly Prevent Speculation in Francs

[Paris] After the Cabinet convened until late last night, the new tax order has been approved by President Lebrun. It is now proposed that the shortfall in the 1937 budget be made up by new taxes. According to Finance Minister Bonnet, the new taxes should make up 800 million francs for the current budget and another 250 million francs for the railways. For speculative gold or foreign currency forward purchase transactions between June 10 and June 30, speculators must pay a special tax of 100% on the extra profits they earn. The production tax has been increased from 6% to 8%, but there is no tax increase on major daily necessities. Tariffs have been increased to the rates implemented before the upper month of 1936. The price of tobacco has been increased by 20%. (Ninth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

[Paris] Various measures concerning financial reorganization were finalized at this evening's Council of Ministers. The content was presented by Finance Minister Bonnet in a statement to the press, stating that the Council of Ministers had taken five decisions: ㊀ The government will confiscate all profits made by French people who engaged in speculative activities detrimental to the franc between June 10 and June 30. ㊁ Severe measures will be used to punish tax evasion. ㊂ The current income tax rate will be increased. ㊃ The import tax rate for certain goods will be increased. ㊄ Railway passenger tickets and freight rates will be increased. In addition, Bonnet stated that preventing speculation, which is the first item in the government's financial plan, is because the recent speculative transactions in forward exchange by French people that are detrimental to the franc are hindering the interests of the country. It is fair for the government to confiscate all the profits earned by these people." Regarding the prevention of tax evasion, the government will order taxpayers to report their holdings of various securities and public bonds on a regular basis, so that tax evasion cannot actually occur. In addition, the government has decided to increase the ordinary income tax rate, the income rate tax for holders of securities and public bonds, and the income tax rate for directors' remuneration of various companies. The stamp tax and registration tax rate, as well as the national undertakings operated with the people, especially railway passenger tickets and freight rates, should be increased. Regarding the reorganization of major railway networks, a joint committee will be organized by the relevant departments of the Cabinet to study the matter as soon as possible, so that the railway business can have a surplus. "In short, the procedures adopted by the government here are an important step in national revival, and various social interests that the French people have always valued will still be protected from harm."

[Paris] Prime Minister Chautemps delivered a radio broadcast declaration this evening, asking the people of the country to support the government's financial actions to improve national prosperity and national defense, stating: "Our country's financial situation is very serious, which can be seen in recent events. For this reason, the government believes that it is necessary to take important measures to make up for the budget deficit, because the budget deficit is a great threat to the national treasury and the franc. Finance Minister Bonnet has formulated various tax measures, the total revenue of which is sufficient to offset the budget deficit for this year. Although this effort is extremely difficult, it is unavoidable. The people of the country must work together to achieve it. We believe that the people of the country will understand this necessity and gladly support the government's financial facilities." (Eighth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

### Both Arab and Jewish Nationalities Express Disappointment with Palestine Partition Plan

Report to Be Submitted to the League of Nations for Discussion; Italy Declares It Will Not Engage in Anti-British Propaganda

Jerusalem, July 9th.

Both Arabs and Jews have expressed disappointment with the Royal Commission's report proposing the division of Palestine into three major regions. The Arab Higher Committee issued a declaration today stating that the Royal Commission intends to establish a Jewish state in the most fertile land of Palestine. The declaration also urged Arabs to adhere to their original procedures and maintain self-restraint. At the same time, the Higher Committee telegraphed to the monarchs of four Arab countries: Hejaz, Transjordan, Iraq, and Yemen, stating that the partition plan gives the best parts of Palestine to the Jews and places the Mosque of Omar and Christian holy sites under permanent British trusteeship, and called on them to rise up against it in the name of God and religion. The Jews are dissatisfied because the area they are to receive is the smallest. Although the southern area is undeveloped, it has the potential for development, and the Jews are unwilling to lose it. British observers predict that riots will not occur and that future steps will involve political discussions. (Central News Agency, Reuters)

Li also hoped that the General Assembly of National Branches of the World Cultural Cooperation Association would hold a meeting in Nanjing soon. In addition, Li also proposed various cultural cooperation methods, the most important of which are the establishment of special university lecture funds and the exchange of students from various countries.

### Hubei Prosecutor Appeals Yang Yongtai Case

Submits Statement of Reasons for Appeal, Arguing That the Original Sentence Was Too Light

Hankou Correspondence, July 7th.

In the Yang Yongtai case, after the initial trial by the Criminal Division of the Wuchang District Court, the defendants Liu Luyin, Cheng Qingchao, Dai Baizhou, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, Nie Jingquan, and Wen Maoguan, as well as the family members of Yang Yongtai, all expressed dissatisfaction and appealed to the High Court. The prosecuting attorney Zhu Chengzan also believed that the original sentence was too light and filed an appeal. The statement of reasons has now been supplemented. The President of the High Court, Xi Chaojun, has appointed Xiong Shichang, the Presiding Judge of the First Criminal Division, as the presiding judge, with Hu Shiao and Yu Jianxun as associate judges. The investigation and trial are scheduled to begin within the next week. The statement of reasons for the prosecuting attorney's appeal is divided into three parts: ㊀ Regarding Cheng Qingchao, Dai Baizhou, Cao Bingrong, and Yang Qixin: Whether the defendants Cheng Qingchao, Dai Baizhou, Cao Bingrong, and Yang Qixin constitute the crime under the first paragraph of Article 154 of the Criminal Code depends on whether the assassination squad organized by Yang Xiaoming meets the criteria for an association under that article. It is clear that an association with the purpose of committing crimes must first have a definite criminal purpose and then engage in the act of association. If only a multitude of people combine without intending to commit a specific crime, then the purpose is unclear before the act occurs, and it is impossible to determine that it is an association under that article. Based on this argument, the assassination squad organized by Yang Xiaoming with the purpose of killing, as recognized by the original judgment, does not lack the conditions for an association under Article 154 of the Criminal Code. Cheng Qingchao, Dai Baizhou, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, etc., who were found to have participated in it, naturally constitute the crime under that article. Furthermore, intending to commit a specific crime and combining in large numbers already constitutes another crime and contains the nature of this article's crime, which is sufficient to be considered a special provision of this article. In other words, the nature of this article's crime must form a condition for the constitution of other crimes before it can be invoked. It cannot be that any crime can preclude the application of this article. The defendants Cheng Qingchao, etc., participated in an association with the purpose of committing crimes and jointly implemented and prepared to commit murder. Although they were all based on one criminal intention, the crime of murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code is not a special provision for crimes against public order, and there is no conflict of laws. How can the crime under this article be ignored? The original judgment stated that "the association under that article refers to those who commit unspecified crimes against unspecified people. The defendants intended to commit a specific crime of murder and conspired to combine in large numbers, which already constitutes the crime of murder, and cannot be charged with the crime under this article again," which is clearly a misunderstanding. Furthermore, the statutory punishment for Yang Qixin's crime of premeditated murder is lighter than that of this article. Now, as a result of the declaration of innocence for the crime of disturbing public order, Article 55 of the Criminal Code cannot be applied to impose a sentence based on the crime under this article, which is even more inappropriate. ㊁ Regarding Li Qunjian: This defendant is Yang Xiaoming's adopted son and lives in Yang Xiaoming's home. He was responsible for communication work for the assassination squad, as Yang Qixin has testified. It can be determined that he has joined the assassination organization. According to the above explanation, it is difficult to escape responsibility under the first paragraph of Article 154 of the Criminal Code. The original trial did not explain the reasons why the facts and evidence identified in the indictment were insufficient to be believed, and instead used the defendant's travels between Shanghai and Hankou as evidence that could not prove that he had committed any crimes, which cannot become credible evidence. ㊂ Regarding Liu Luyin: The defendant Liu Luyin instigated Yang Xiaoming to organize an assassination squad to assassinate the former Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Yang Yongtai, and conspired to assassinate the former Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Qun, Minister of the Interior Jiang Zuobin, Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng, and Chairman Chiang, which has been recognized by the original judgment. Based on the same understanding as above, this defendant has committed the crimes of instigating murder and disturbing public order under the latter paragraph of Article 154 of the Criminal Code through one act. This is a concurrence of offenses, not a conflict of laws. The original judgment ignored the crime of disturbing public order, which is clearly inappropriate. Furthermore, regarding the sentencing, although the weight of the sentence is within the discretion of the judges, in addition to paying attention to the standard items listed in Article 57 of the Criminal Code, they must also investigate all circumstances and strive for fairness in order to be convincing. Whether the defendant's motive for committing the crime was due to a lack of understanding of the central government's painstaking efforts to plan the country still needs to be investigated. However, considering the circumstances of the case, imposing only the lightest imprisonment of ten years is somewhat unfair. Moreover, using his years of following the Premier and engaging in the National Revolution, as well as his repeated expressions of admiration for the central leaders during the trial, as reasons for reducing the sentence is also inappropriate. In conclusion, it is believed that the judgment in this part is inappropriate, and an appeal is filed according to law for redress.

### Long-Haired Dao Followers Spreading in Northern Henan Arrested

Long-Haired Dao Used by Traitors, Authorities in Henan Have Strictly Banned It

Zhengzhou Correspondence, July 7th.

The heretical sect "Long-Haired Dao" has recently spread to more than ten counties in northern Henan. Because it is a reactionary organization used by traitors, the Henan authorities have strictly ordered their subordinates to ban it, so there have been repeated crackdowns in various places. Earlier this month, the Anyang garrison and police station received reports that a large number of traitors were using the name of "Long-Haired Dao" to conspire to disrupt public order. They dispatched officers to investigate strictly. In recent days, they arrested sixteen "Long-Haired Dao" followers, including Feng Tianhe, Su Xin, and Cheng Faxing, in Dongguan, Huangkou Village in the western countryside, and the railway station in the county. They also seized various books and photos. The content of the books promoted the imperial system, slandered the Republic of China, and was extremely absurd. The photos were all of the Tianjin headquarters of the Dao. After interrogation by the Fourth District Commissioner's Office, the suspects confessed that the Dao was named "One Heart Dao," also known as "Long-Haired Dao." When joining the Dao, there must be an introducer. The introducers for the suspects were mostly local people, Ma Xingguang (also known as Meng Guangzhi, who has been arrested in Ji County). The purpose of joining the Dao is to be loyal to the ruler, filial to parents, and harmonious in the neighborhood, to endure hardship and be patient, and to worship deities, such as "Infinite Parents, Heavenly Earth Mother, Infinite Old Mother." The secret words in the Dao are "Incense can be burned on Mount Wutai, sixty-three true natures return to heaven, change the disclosure, Ming Gong slays, Wudang bombs to death," "Incense can be burned on Mount Wutai, monks should be made on Mount Wutai, sixty-three true natures return to heaven, put on Taoist robes in the fortieth year of the Republic of China to avoid calamity," etc. Fellow believers address each other as senior brothers. The main altar (headquarters) is located near the Zhongyuan Company in the Tianjin Japanese Concession. The room is full of reeds, and shoes must be taken off before entering. Once inside, actions are restricted. The person in charge of the main altar is called "Old Mother," is a woman, about fifty years old, wears a round-neck blue shirt, has bound feet, and sits cross-legged all day long. Her speech has a Shandong accent. When Feng Tianhe and Su Xin left Tianjin, the "Old Mother" gave each of them a Taoist robe, ordering them to put it on when their true nature returned to heaven, which could avoid calamity and fly through the clouds. She also gave them a Sanlun calendar comparison table, telling them to remember the date and put on the Taoist robe when disaster struck to avoid it.

### Achievements of the Baojia System in Fujian

As of the end of March this year, except for Ningde, Jianou, Shouning, Yongding Counties, and Tuoshou, Shangyang, and Fengshi Special Zones, the remaining more than 50 counties and cities, including Minhou, Xiamen, and Changle, and Heshan and Nanri Special Zones have all been completed. According to the Provincial Government's announcement, the total population of Fujian Province is 12,642,000, of which nine-tenths have been processed. As for the organizational method, in addition to the household head, Jia head, and Bao head, there are also Lianbao. Lianbao offices are established for every five Bao or more. The Baojia heads are of uneven levels of education, and some are illiterate. Therefore, the Reorganization and Implementation Law promulgated in November of the 24th year stipulated training regulations, with Bao heads trained for three weeks and Jia heads trained for ten days. In addition to basic methods of popular rights, meeting essentials, and the essentials of the Baojia, they are also trained according to the strong men team implementation plan. Currently, 11,855 Bao heads and 29,150 Jia heads have been trained throughout the province.

The training of strong men is currently undertaken by the National Military Training Committee. According to its plan, 894,400 people should receive basic training before the 26th year of the Republic of China. As of the end of January this year, more than half have already been trained, and it will not be difficult to complete the task on schedule. As for the funding, it is allocated from the house and land tax. The water Baojia has also completed its investigation and is about to begin, divided into twelve districts and fifty-two sections.

### Haimen

Farmers Oppose Building Culverts

The Xinkaigang River in Haimen was funded and built by the local gentry Gu Jinfang in the mid-Qing Dynasty. It starts from Dalian Town in the north and reaches the Yangtze River in the south, with a total length of more than ten Li. It is purely for draining water during rainy seasons and irrigating during droughts. Recently, the Puqi Provincial Highway is being built, and culverts are planned to be built across the river. The area is reportedly 2.3 square meters, but the river section is about 11.5 square meters. The culvert area is only one-fifth of the river section area. More than 100,000 farmers in the area believe that this culvert will hinder farmland irrigation and water conservancy. They were shocked and sent representatives to the county government to petition, and also telegraphed the Provincial Construction Department to abolish the culvert and build a bridge. The farmers' attitude is firm. It is expected that the government will uphold the principle of construction for the people and will surely agree to the public opinion of the people.

### Cixi

County Middle School Building New School Buildings

Cixi County Middle School has been established for three years, and the old school buildings are insufficient. Last year, County Magistrate Dai Shixi and Principal Chen Qianfu initiated fundraising to build new ones. They expanded the site of the old Cihu Academy to five or sixty Mu, facing the lakeside and backing Guanfeng, with extremely beautiful scenery. Since construction began in the autumn of last year, the auditorium, classrooms, lecture halls, and dormitories have been completed. The library, faculty rooms, and sports field are also under construction. Some can be used for the autumn semester this year, accommodating five or six hundred students. The old site has been donated by enthusiastic gentry and merchants from Shanghai to set up a complete primary school named Nianci, which will also start at the same time in the autumn. It is now heard that both schools are enrolling students, and there are many applicants. The examination is scheduled to be held on August 5th.

### How to Mobilize the Countryside to Build Rural Areas

— Wu Tiecheng

(Speech at the Joint Conference of Various Agencies of the Guangdong Provincial Government on the Mobilization of Rural Construction, June 28) (Continued)

The highest administrative body of a county is, of course, the county government. Below the county, in other provinces, there are district offices, and below the district offices are township offices. Guangdong is different. Below the county, there are no districts, but rather joint township self-government offices, directly under the county government. The county government directly commands the townships. The joint township self-government office is merely a mobile guidance agency. The system of joint township self-government offices has not been implemented for long, and its effects are unclear. We don't need to criticize its merits for the time being. However, in any case, under the organizational circumstances of the counties in Guangdong, it is definitely not enough to rely solely on the power of the Party government to promote the participation of the people of the whole county in the rural construction movement. In my personal opinion, I would like to use the principals and teachers of the primary schools in each county and the security teams stationed in each county as the cellular organization to promote this movement. If the principals and teachers of the primary schools in each county, as well as the security teams, can take on this responsibility, I think the rural construction movement in each county can be promoted. Because, in addition to the technical aspects related to farmland irrigation, etc., we have competent authorities to be responsible for implementation. There are many other areas where the people of the whole county need to be mobilized to participate. For example, Baojia system, afforestation, public health, militia training, road construction, simple water conservancy projects, reclamation of wasteland, and cooperation, all of these things can only be effective if the people participate in them. To get the local people to participate, in addition to the county government bearing the responsibility of guidance, we must have a driving center. In my personal study, the most suitable center is the schools and security teams in each county and township. Because many township chiefs lack the knowledge, ability, time, and energy. And it is especially insufficient for the county magistrate alone to command the people of the whole county to participate in and engage in a new movement. Therefore, there must be an organization in each locality below the county to serve as a driving center. It is best to find a suitable organization in each locality. There is nothing better than the principals and teachers of the schools in each county, as well as the security team members. (To be continued)

### Yarn Exchange Storm: Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi Surrendered Yesterday, Court Continues Investigation

Wen Lanting, Wang Xiaolai, and Others Were Summoned to Testify; Wu and Sheng Were Released on Cash Bail

Wu Qiding, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Sheng Shengyi, Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau, are suspected of being involved in the yarn and cloth exchange storm in this city. The authorities transferred the case to the Shanghai First Special District Court Procuratorate for investigation. Song Genshan, Prosecutor of the First Special Court, held a court session on the 3rd of this month. Because Wu and Sheng were in Beijing and did not arrive, only the witnesses, including Mu Xiangyue, Chairman of the Yarn Exchange, were interrogated once, and the hearing was adjourned. This was reported in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the second investigation of the case was scheduled. The witnesses summoned included Chen Yu, Counselor representing the Ministry of Industry; Wen Lanting, Standing Director of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange; Shao Wenmei, Vice Chairman of the Yarn Exchange Brokerage Association; Chen Kangshan of He Xing Hao, Broker No. 27; Wang Xiaolai, Supervisor of the Exchange; Sun Yufeng of Shen Kang Hao, Broker No. 57; and Yu Qiaqing, etc. Except for Yu Qiaqing and Sun Yufeng, who were summoned by telegram by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go to Lushan for questioning, and delegated Jiang Yiping and Chen Rentao to appear in court, all others complied with the summons and appeared in court. The investigated persons, Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi, had also been ordered to come to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and at 9:15 yesterday morning, Wu, accompanied by his defense lawyers Tong Yuwen and Ji Jinfu, and Sheng, accompanied by his defense lawyers Ma Shouhua and Li Zhaofu, arrived in court to respond to the interrogation. Spectators concerned about the case also filled the seats. At 9 o'clock, Prosecutor Song ascended to the 7th courtroom for interrogation. He first interrogated the witness Wen Lanting, asking about his age, origin, etc. Then, he informed him that the case was greatly related to the Exchange. As the Standing Director of the Yarn Exchange, he knew more details than others. According to the law, he had an obligation to testify truthfully, so he must truthfully state the facts and not conceal anything. After taking an oath, he was interrogated. According to Wen Lanting's answers to the questions in court, he did not know Wu Qiding, but only met him when Wu was assigned to investigate the Exchange this time. Sheng Shengyi was from the same hometown, and they had known each other since childhood, but they had not seen each other for a long time. The Exchange directly contacted brokers, but did not know the clients who entrusted transactions. Once, when talking with Chairman Mu and others, he heard that there were many bull speculators, including Sheng and others, but he did not actually say so, nor did he report it. He did not know the rumor that Sheng Shengyi was a bull speculator. Therefore, Chairman Mu's statement last time that he had said so was a misunderstanding. Now Mr. Mu has been summoned to Lushan and is expected to return to Shanghai in a few days. The court then ordered Wen to leave and summoned Zhu Xiaolai to the case. According to Wang's testimony, when talking with Minister Wu on the 30th of last month, he mentioned that it was rumored that Sheng Laoqi was a bull speculator, but it was purely a rumor. He did not know about the trading situation and Sheng's familiarity with the brokers of the He family. As for Wu Qiding's part, he had not heard anything. Then, Jiang Yiping, representing Yu Qiaqing, stated that Yu had been summoned to Lushan the day before and could not attend court. He requested to make a statement. He did not know anything about the case and could not answer on his behalf. He should wait for Yu to return to Shanghai and come to court to state the facts in person. Afterwards, Shao Wenmei was summoned and testified that on the 4th of this month, when talking with Director Yan Shenyu of the Ministry of Industry, he mentioned that Broker No. 17 bought and sold on behalf of the Sheng family in large quantities, but he did not know the amount of transactions. According to observations of the Exchange's forms, the bull speculators in this case included Brokers No. 15, No. 35, No. 50, No. 51, No. 42, No. 57, etc., while the bear speculators included No. 56, but the bear speculators were scattered and difficult to count. The court then summoned Sheng Shengyi to the case. According to his statement, he was 37 years old, from Changzhou, and lived at 526 Jing'an Temple Road. He was currently the Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau. He had three brothers and eight sisters. He was the seventh child, but they had all separated and did not often visit. Prosecutor Song then informed him that he and Wu Qiding had violated Article 137 of the Criminal Law and Article 52 of the Exchange Law. The court was investigating the case according to law and asked him the reason for not attending last time. Sheng immediately replied that on the 29th of last month, because it was rumored that he and Director Wu were involved in speculation and manipulation of the yarn exchange, he went to Beijing overnight to request Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to investigate thoroughly. Later, he received a reply telegram, ordering the Ministry of Finance to jointly investigate with the Ministry of Industry impartially, so he stayed in Beijing to await investigation. Therefore, he had not received the summons, and he did not dare to leave Beijing because he was ordered by his superiors. This was the reason for his absence. He had lived in Shanghai for a long time and knew many people. He was acquainted with Mr. Yu Qiaqing. When he worked at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he often met with Yu because of official business with the Sanbei Shipping Company. Recently, he had not seen him for a long time. He asked himself if he had no enemies. Since he had worked in the Ministry of Finance for six years and in the Tax Bureau for two years, he might have offended others in his position, but he had absolutely not engaged in buying and selling in the Exchange. He did not know how the rumors started this time and asked the court to investigate thoroughly. He also asked what the basis of the case was, and if it was based solely on rumors, it seemed unfair. The court asked if he knew Xu Maochang. (Answer) He did not know him, but he was acquainted with his brother Xu Maotang, the manager of the China and Foreign Bank. He did not know if Mu Xiangyue had any evidence when he said that he was a bull speculator. The court then summoned Wu Qiding for interrogation. According to his statement, he was 46 years old, from Cixi, Zhejiang, and lived at 56 Masnan Road. He had been the Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance for more than three years. He was also one of the investigators of this storm. After hearing the rumors, he went to Beijing to request Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to investigate thoroughly. He had never engaged in buying and selling in the Yarn and Cloth Exchange. He did not know where Yuan Da Hao was at all. Dai Hangzhuan was the former accounting director of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. He was the chairman of the board, so he knew him. Because he handled affairs very well, he was deeply trusted by all the directors. He had never entrusted Dai to do any buying and selling. He did not know why his name was added to the Yuan Tian Hao account under Dai Hangzhua's name. He did not know Yang Shuding and Yang Yuankai. Then the court summoned Chen Kangshan, who stated that Sheng Shengyi did not have any transactions at his firm, but Sheng's fifth daughter had some transactions at his firm, about two to three thousand packages, under the names of Sheng Xingji and Wei Ji (homophonic). Chen Rentao, the representative of Sun Yufeng, stated that Sun had been summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go to Lushan for questioning and could not attend today. Shi, Chen Yu, Counselor of the Ministry of Industry, stated that although the Ministry had sent accounting director Wang Fuyan and accountant Ji Xizong to investigate the bank's books and evidence, it was difficult for the Ministry to investigate because the bank was under the jurisdiction of the competent authority. Now the Ministry was instructed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to hand over the case to the court for handling, so it was not actively pursuing it. Recently, the relevant books and records were submitted to the court for investigation. According to the law, civil servants cannot engage in transactions. If they do, the brokers must also be subject to appropriate punishment, so they are all concealing and unwilling to tell the truth. Moreover, although the Exchange Law clearly stipulates that there shall be no small companies except for brokers, there are actually many small companies, such as Yuan Da, which is one of the small companies, so it is difficult to investigate the transfer of bills. He then submitted a written statement (recorded later) and two copies of the recent minutes of the Ministry of Industry's talks with various brokers to the court. Sheng Shengyi and Wu Qiding then requested the court to conduct a fair and speedy investigation so that the truth could be revealed and stated that the reports that they were escorted to Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance were not true. They had come voluntarily after receiving a summons. Prosecutor Song reviewed the evidence and announced that the case would be postponed because further investigation of the evidence was required. He ordered Sheng to pay 20,000 yuan in cash bail and Wu Qiding to pay 10,000 yuan in cash bail to be released and await further summons. The court then adjourned. The original text of the Ministry of Industry's second written statement by the representative of the Ministry of Industry is as follows: As for Wu Qiding's part of the case, the Ministry has already submitted the customer's list of Yuan Da as an attachment and there is no need to repeat it. As for Sheng Shengyi's part, in addition to Chairman Mu Xiangyue and Mr. Yu Qiaqing stating that he was indeed a person who participated in the manipulation, it has been explained at the previous hearing. Further evidence obtained from various parties, such as Wang Xiaolai, the Exchange Supervisor dispatched by the Ministry and the Ministry of Finance, meeting Minister Wu in Beijing and saying, "Sheng is an important figure who instigates market manipulation." Brokers such as Zhu Baozhong, manager of No. 68, said, "In the market, I often hear that the price of yarn is high because the Sheng family is buying, and the price of yarn is low because the Sheng family is selling." A few words show the extent of Sheng's power in the market. Chen Chujiang, broker of No. 39, said, "It is rumored that Sheng Laoqi is a bull speculator this time." Shao Wenmei, vice chairman of the Brokerage Association, said, "In the market, I often hear that the Sheng family is buying and selling, and the amount is not small. Almost everyone who hears it is familiar with it." The statements are the same as those of Chairman Mu, Supervisor Wang, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing. According to various brokers, Sheng's buying and selling are mostly handled by Brokers No. 27 and No. 57. Sun Shouxi, the representative of Broker No. 57, said that the account names in that number, Jinru Ji, Ai Ji, Wang Ru Ji, Kang Jin Ji, and Jin Ji, are all transactions made by Sheng's seventh daughter and her husband and said, "Sheng Laoqi has transactions, probably entrusted to others to do." Chen Kangshan, a shareholder of No. 27, also admitted that Sheng's fifth daughter had long been buying and selling at that number under the names of Sheng Yingji and Huiji, and said, "It is rumored that Brokers No. 57 and No. 68 have done it for the Sheng family this year." Sun Bangrui, a shareholder of No. 27, also said that Yizhuang Yongji represented the Sheng family and was introduced by Sun Shangxiang to do business. Later, the company contacted by telephone. Sheng Benzhuang had an intercom, but later it was dismantled because it was rumored that the Sheng family's business was too big, and said that there were also Yingji and Huiji on the Sheng family's side. It can be seen that the Sheng family has long been buying and selling at No. 57 and No. 27, and No. 27 is equipped with an intercom. The transactions are definitely not a few. Later, the intercom was dismantled for fear of criticism. The Sheng Laoqi's manipulation of the market, which is widely heard by various parties, is enough to prove that the rumors are big, and Sheng himself is already wary, which is not a false accusation. According to Shao Wenmei, Vice Chairman of the Brokerage Association, "Recently, civil servants often buy and sell by transferring to others, without signing their names, without directly paying or receiving payments, which is called a living method." Wang Suizhi, manager of the small company Yuan Maoyong, said, "The market rumor says that Brokers No. 27, No. 57, No. 35, etc., are all doing business for Sheng Laoqi." Therefore, the Sheng family's business claimed by No. 27 and No. 57 is done by the fifth and seventh daughters. According to the public servant speculation "living method" mentioned by Shao Wenmei, Vice Chairman of the Brokerage Association, it is undoubtedly Sheng Shengyi's disguised evasion. In short, since the Exchange Law was amended and promulgated in April 24, Article 41 stipulates that "brokers shall not accept entrustment from civil servants for short selling and short buying transactions," and Article 49 stipulates that brokers and civil servants shall be punished together. During the frequent storms in securities and yarn, the government has repeatedly investigated and dealt with them. The methods of evading by speculators have become increasingly sophisticated. Not only do they themselves refuse to admit it, but the brokers are also very secretive. Moreover, how can those who have been experienced in manipulating the market dare to trade directly in their real names and put themselves in danger? According to the investigation conducted by the Ministry, Sheng Shengyi is an important figure in this storm. Almost everyone says the same thing. It is only because the brokers who handle the transactions have their own interests and have to conceal it together. Other brokers or firms often have many concerns. When the Ministry separately summons them for questioning, each broker or firm is hesitant and fearful, or sobbing and swallowing. Occasionally, a few words are revealed unintentionally, and they beg not to be recorded. Even if they are driven by conscience and forced by righteousness, they can barely say a few words and have to pretend to be relatives and tell rumors to avoid being implicated. All these expressions are vivid. The Ministry has consulted extensively and tried to understand the truth. The statements obtained from various parties, such as Chairman Mu Xiangyue, who is in charge of the office, and is most familiar with the situation in the office, and Supervisor Wang Xiaolai, who is responsible for supervising the office, and is also the chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce and the speaker of the Municipal Council, must have heard everything accurately. Mr. Yu Qiaqing has lived in Shanghai for decades and is fair and unselfish. The whole city knows it. The accusations are all what the merchants in the city want to say but dare not say. Referring to the news heard and seen by various brokers and merchants, it can be proved that it is by no means groundless. After a long investigation by the Ministry, it is believed that Sheng Shengyi has used his official position to manipulate the market and is suspected of serious misconduct, and it is hereby reiterated for reference.

### The Administrative Investigation of the Yarn Exchange Storm Has Been Completed

The Results Have Been Transferred to the Court, and the Account Books Have Been Returned Separately

The Ministry of Industry was previously ordered by President Chiang Kai-shek to investigate and deal with the yarn and cloth exchange storm. Vice Minister Cheng Tiangu and Minister Wu Dingchang came to Shanghai one after another to conduct a serious investigation. By yesterday, considerable results had been obtained. The investigation results were transferred to the court for investigation according to law, and reported to President Chiang Kai-shek for review. It is now known that Minister Wu telegraphed the investigators in Shanghai from Guling yesterday, saying that he had received a decree from the President that the case was completely handed over to the court for serious handling according to law. The administrative investigation procedures have been completed. Yesterday afternoon, the investigators agreed to return the various account books that had been reviewed by the Social Bureau a few days ago, all of which were unrelated to military matters, after they were stamped and issued to various brokers and firms. Those who had opened them were transferred to the court for investigation. It is said that Director Yan, Counselor Chen, Section Chief Kuang, and Director Wang will return to Beijing within a few days after the task is completed.

The details are as follows:

Representatives Present

Chairman's Report

First, the chairman made a report, saying, in brief, that today is the 11th anniversary of the Northern Expedition. Recalling the time before the Northern Expedition, warlords occupied various provinces in the country, foreign aggression was imminent, and the country was in a state of division and separation, with each pursuing its own policies. The people were in the midst of water and fire. At that time, it was the first year after the death of the Prime Minister, and the Revolutionary Army already had considerable strength. Therefore, Commander-in-Chief Chiang was appointed to swear an oath and launch the Northern Expedition, starting from Guangdong. Like a whirlwind sweeping away the clouds, it was invincible. Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang, and others, although possessing heavy troops, were eventually defeated one by one by the Revolutionary Army. Although there was external pressure from the May 3rd Jinan incident, which hindered the advance of the Revolutionary Army, unification was soon completed. It was so rapid because it was due to the support of the people. However, at that time, it was subject to heavy external pressure. If there was any hesitation, it would be difficult to complete the unification. Therefore, there has been the evil phenomenon of the remaining warlord forces disturbing the country for the past ten years. In recent years, these people have been influenced by the doctrine. By the end of last year, this spirit had been fully expressed. Currently, it is already a period of resisting foreign aggression. Now that it is reported that a conflict has occurred between the Chinese and Japanese armies at Lugouqiao, it can be seen that the friendly countries are truly friendly and supportive to us. Therefore, now we Chinese people must recognize the following two points: ㊀ The situation of the domestic revolution and the environment in which it is located; ㊁ There is no need to talk empty words of revenge. We must cultivate our own strength. We must have faith in the central government, trust the authorities, and have confidence in ourselves. Only in this way can we resist foreign aggression. Finally, the meeting adjourned after shouting slogans.

Yesterday was the anniversary of the Northern Expedition. All organs, groups, schools, party headquarters at all levels, and households in the city, in addition to sending representatives to participate in the memorial meeting convened by the Municipal Party Headquarters, hung flags for one day to celebrate.

### Li Liejun Transferred to Guangci Hospital Yesterday for Recuperation

Chiang and Feng Send Representatives to Shanghai to Offer Condolences; Ding Chao and Others Continue to Visit

National Government Member Li Liejun, whose brain disease has worsened, has been recuperating at the Baohua Temple in Dachang, West Shanghai. After diagnosis and treatment by renowned doctors, his condition has gradually improved. Now, because the weather is getting hotter and the temple is remote, with many inconveniences in terms of medicine, it was decided by the doctors to transfer him to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road in Shanghai for recuperation. Yesterday morning (5:00 AM), he was taken by a safety ambulance, accompanied by doctors, and traveled through the city center to arrive safely at the hospital. Dr. Volliot, a physician at the hospital, examined him. Because the journey was slightly bumpy, his blood pressure was slightly high, his body temperature was 36 degrees Celsius, and his pulse was 80. According to Dr. Volliot, the treatment is progressing very well. Judging from the current situation, he can recover his health with proper rest. After the news of Member Li's illness was published in the newspaper, condolences were sent from all sides, with dozens of telegrams arriving daily. Central committee members and local officials from various provinces have all sent telegrams. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek not only sent a telegram of condolence and inquired in detail about his condition, but also sent a representative to Shanghai to visit him. Feng Yuxiang is particularly concerned, sending several telegrams a day. The representative he sent arrived in Shanghai from Guling the day before yesterday and went to Baohua Temple to visit. After the transfer to Guangci Hospital yesterday, members of the Central Committee Bai Wenwei, Jiangsu Inspector Ding Chao, and many other relatives and friends continued to visit him.

### Zou Mu's Remarks on the Suspected Speculation Case of Wu Sheng

According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Zou Lin, Vice Minister of Finance, came to Shanghai on the 3rd of this month, under orders, to thoroughly investigate whether Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi participated in speculation at the Cloth Exchange. The content of his questioning of Mu Xiangyue, Chairman of the Exchange, is extremely important in relation to the case and is highly valued by people in society. The main points of the investigation obtained at that time are as follows for reference by those who are concerned: Zou (asked): Is there any evidence that Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi engaged in speculation? Mu (replied): I have no knowledge of any evidence regarding Wu and Sheng. When the Ministry of Industry and the Supervisory Yuan inquired, I answered at the time that I did not know who the manipulators were. Minister Wu said that if there were any rumors about who they were, they could be brought up, regardless of whether there was evidence. On the one hand, evidence must be investigated, and on the other hand, public opinion must be interviewed. It is said that rumors can be made without taking responsibility. I answered at the time that the first rumor was Xu Maochang, the second was Xu Chongzhi (because Xu often said that Xu Chongzhi came to his house), the third was Wu Ruiyuan, and the fourth was Sheng Laoqi (I don't know his official title). As for Wu Qiding, I didn't know him before. I only met him when Vice Minister Cheng came to investigate. I said the same today when I was a witness in court. (Who were the major buyers and sellers in May and June?) (Answer) The brokers and major clients report every day, which can be checked. The exchange does not know about outsiders contacting brokers. (Question) Who are the rumored major clients? (Answer) It is also difficult to find out. (Question) Among the brokers punished by the Ministry of Industry, which ones have a relationship with Sheng? It should be possible to find out. (Answer) It is impossible to find out. (Question) Who said and who heard these rumors? (Answer) I cannot answer. I said the same in court. (Question) Since Sheng is a bull, how much did he buy in total? (Answer) I don't know. Kuang Yunwen, Section Chief of the First Section of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, also said in court today that he did not know. Even the original investigator Kuang does not know, so how could we know? Moreover, Section Chief Kuang stated that to this day, it is still not known whether Wu and Sheng are the real market manipulators. Last time, Minister Wu asked those present whether there were any market manipulators. I answered that civil servants manipulating the market was a rumor spread by Japanese newspapers, and we should not be used by them. (Question) Then where is the evidence for the rumors about Sheng? (Answer) There was no basis. What I said last time was a report of rumors based on Minister Wu not taking responsibility. (Question) Is there any evidence that Wu Qiding manipulated the market? (Answer) The exchange did not know before, and only learned from the newspapers that Wu was also involved. (Question) What was Wu's situation when the court inquired? (Answer) The Social Bureau found in the broker's book of the Yuanda Securities Exchange that last year, Director Dai of the Jiangzhe Bank bought tens of thousands of yuan of public bonds. Because Yuanda did not know who Director Dai was, they inquired with Wu Qiding, Chairman of the Jiangzhe Bank, and learned that he was a staff member of the bank. Therefore, the name Wu Qiding was noted on Yuanda's relief ledger. (Question) What did the representative of the Ministry of Industry say in court? (Answer) Section Chief Li stated in court that there was no evidence for either Wu or Sheng. (Question) Is it rumored that there are other people from the Ministry of Finance participating in speculation? (Answer) No. (Question) Are there people from other departments participating? (Answer) I don't usually pay attention. (Question) Civil servants are not allowed to manipulate the market. This thorough investigation is extremely important. If you have anything to say but don't say it, the chairman should be held responsible. (Answer) The government's thorough investigation this time is extremely welcome by the exchange. However, the exchange's trading object is the broker. As for whether there are civil servants manipulating the market, we have never asked. The former Ministry of Industry ordered the exchange to truthfully report any such cases. The exchange sent a letter to the Broker's Association to inquire, but there were no results, which will be reported accordingly. (Question) That is usually the case, but after the turmoil occurred, the board of directors should investigate and find out who the manipulators are. (Answer) It is impossible to find out.

### Securities Rebound After Truce at Lugou Bridge

Trading Increased Sharply Yesterday; Less Trading in the Afternoon Session

The market in both the securities and gold industries yesterday, except for the gold industry, which was closed for the Northern Expedition Vow Ceremony, saw a sharp drop in securities prices the day before. The two types of unified public bonds, B and C, fell by more than four yuan and were suspended from trading. After the margin calls were made up yesterday morning, the market opened as usual at 10:30 AM. Trading increased sharply.

### Qingdao Industrial and Commercial Delegation Visited the Seven Exhibition Halls Yesterday

They Will Visit Factories and Schools Starting Today

Since arriving in Shanghai a few days ago, the Qingdao Industrial and Commercial Delegation has been very busy with social engagements. Yesterday morning, led by the head of the delegation, Mr. Dong Zhidao, they continued to visit the seven major exhibition halls in the city center. The visit was divided into two groups: one for the education sector, which visited the literature and art aspects, and one for the industrial and commercial sector, which visited the handicrafts and business practices, etc. Starting today, the China General Chamber of Industry will send Secretary Wu Shuchen to accompany them to visit major factories and secondary schools.

### Women's Representatives Held a Meeting Yesterday to Report on the Petition Process

A Total of Thirty Candidates Were Recommended in This City

Various women's organizations in this city, in order to strive for participation in the National Congress for Constitutional Drafting, sent representatives to Beijing to attend the National Women's Representative Election Conference. All of them have arrived in Shanghai one after another. In order for the representatives to report on the process of attending the conference, a joint meeting was held at 5:00 PM yesterday at the China Guinu Alliance Association on the third floor of the Women's Bank on Nanjing Road. More than thirty people attended, including Chen Yubai, Lu Lihua, Qian Jianqiu, Jin Guangmei, Zhu Kuangzheng, Yu Feng, and Liu Wuli Ming. Chairman Lu Lihua first delivered the opening speech, followed by Qian Jianqiu's report on the conference process, stating that more than twenty of us set off for Beijing on June 30th. On the morning of the 1st, we paid our respects at the mausoleum, and in the afternoon, we held a preparatory meeting and established a committee. The Shanghai representative was Lin Kecong. The next day, representatives were recommended to carry documents and petition the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government. Secretary-General Ye Chucang of the Central Party Headquarters received them and agreed to forward them to the Central Government for review. A certain lady received them at the National Government, and the result was also quite satisfactory. In the afternoon, because there were too many proposals, they were not sorted out, so other cases were discussed. As for the candidates, they were not originally proposed in advance, but because the central government wanted to prepare, they requested that the candidates be proposed in advance. Because Shanghai is a special municipality with a large population, a total of thirty people were recommended. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.

### Jews in Shanghai Oppose the Partition of Palestine

Talks with Jewish Leaders in Shanghai

According to the Dalu News, after the British government proposed the partition of Palestine, its reporter visited Jewish leaders in this city and they firmly opposed the proposal. According to the person in charge of the Jewish General Association in Shanghai, this proposal is extremely unfair. The Jewish people cannot be said to have not worked hard for the British government. The current approach of the British government is extremely unfair. The Arabs currently occupy vast lands in Palestine. Under the current circumstances, most of the Arab people, especially the farmers, feel satisfied because they have been greatly oppressed by the Turks in the past. Moreover, Palestine is not currently crowded, and there is no need to expand the residential area. The Jewish people in Shanghai do not intend to protest this matter, but the Jewish people in the United States have decided to send representatives to Britain to negotiate.

### Yan E'sheng Telegraphs Request to Use Monument Funds for National Salvation

The Emergency in North China Requires the Concentration of Resources

For the tenth anniversary of the city of Shanghai, various groups have collected 10,000 yuan to build a Tang Yin Monument for the former four mayors. Now, citizen Yan E'sheng, in light of the emergency in North China, sent telegrams yesterday morning to the three former mayors, Zhang Boqiong, Zhang Yuejun, and Wu Tiecheng, requesting that the funds be used for national salvation. The telegram read: Respectfully to Mr. Zhang Boxuan of Guilin, Mr. Zhang Yuejun of Guling, and Mr. Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai, the citizens of Shanghai commemorate their achievements on the tenth anniversary of the city and have collected 10,000 yuan to build a monument in their memory. However, in light of the emergency in North China, the people should concentrate their resources for national use. I dare to ask you to give up this honor and use the funds to save the country and resist the enemy, which would further enhance your great virtues. I eagerly await your reply. Citizen Yan E'sheng bows in respect.

### The City's Aircraft Purchase Celebration Meeting Will Hold a Concluding Meeting Tomorrow

The Goal of One Million Yuan Has Been Achieved

On October 30th of last year, on the occasion of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday, various circles in this city, in order to support the leader and celebrate the occasion, initiated a fundraising campaign to present aircraft to the government as a birthday gift. The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Fundraising and Purchasing Aircraft to Present to the Government as a Memorial for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th Birthday was organized and started in March of last year. Due to the enthusiastic support of all circles and their generous donations, the goal of one million yuan has been achieved. The committee has repeatedly sent more than 860,000 yuan to the Chiang Kai-shek Birthday Aircraft Presentation Committee. There are still more than 200,000 yuan that various groups have identified as unpaid, which are being collected. In total, the amount has exceeded the original target, which shows the sincerity of the citizens of this city in supporting the leader. It is reported that the committee believes that the time has been long and it should be concluded as soon as possible. It has been decided to hold a meeting at 4:00 PM tomorrow (the 11th) on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to discuss the conclusion. Letters have been sent to all committee members, agencies, groups, and schools, asking them to send representatives to participate. It is also reported that the committee will compile a general report on the fundraising process and the amount of donations, which will be published and distributed soon.

### China Aviation Corporation's Chongqing-Guiyang Line Expected to Resume Regular Flights

The original Chongqing-Guiyang route of the China Aviation Corporation has been suspended for a long time. Recently, the Ministry of Communications, considering that the route is related to transportation in the southwest border area, ordered the China Aviation Corporation to prepare for the resumption of flights as soon as possible. After receiving the order, the company's Aircraft Engineering Group has been actively preparing everything. It is now learned that the company is rushing to install the new Douglas aircraft recently shipped from the United States. It is expected to be completed in about two days. After the aircraft is installed, it will be flown on the Shanghai-Hankou route, and the Ford aircraft originally flying on the Shanghai-Hankou route will be transferred to the Chongqing-Guiyang route. The preparations for the resumption of flights on the line are expected to be completed within this week, and it is expected to officially resume flights on the 17th of this month.

### Shanghai Money Exchange Industry Association Held a General Meeting Yesterday and Resolved to Reward Informants of Fake Manchukuo Banknotes

Full Oath Tomorrow Afternoon at 2:00 PM; Wang He'an Proposed Informant Method

The Shanghai Money Exchange Industry Association, in order to stop the non-acceptance of fake Manchukuo banknotes, convened an extraordinary meeting of member representatives at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss effective methods. The representatives at the meeting were indignant and enthusiastic. After the opening ceremony, Chairman Pan Bingchen delivered a speech, saying that the fake Manchukuo banknotes are being promoted aggressively in Shanghai, using all possible means. The newspapers reported the day before yesterday that Japanese factories were paying wages with 20% of fake Manchukuo banknotes. This kind of vicious method is more harmful than smuggling, because smuggling still requires capital to create goods before they can be smuggled into China for sale. However, the amount of losses suffered by Chinese customs duties is already alarming. If fake Manchukuo banknotes are allowed to circulate unimpeded, wouldn't Manchukuo be exchanging goods for paper? If Chinese people do not consider the pros and cons and use them, the harm will be unimaginable. The crime is even worse than that of a traitor, because a traitor can only live in one place, while a traitor who uses fake Manchukuo banknotes affects the livelihood of the entire country, reaching far and wide. This industry is the hub for exchanging currencies from various countries, and fake Manchukuo banknotes are most easily in contact with our industry. Our members must all fulfill their national duties and refuse to accept them. The association has now printed oaths, and we ask all members to affix their seals according to the format and bring them to the association at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th to take the oath. Everyone has come to the meeting so enthusiastically today, and you are all patriotic people. If you have any good ideas, please express your great opinions. Yu He'an proposed that refusing to accept fake Manchukuo banknotes based only on conscience and morality may not be able to stop those who are greedy for profit and forget righteousness. The association must heavily reward informants. If the evidence is verified, the manager of the accepting shop will be sent to the Committee for Not Buying or Selling Smuggled Goods for strict handling, so that close surveillance can be achieved. Mr. Wang, the manager of Shunyu Shop, was falsely accused of being responsible for promoting fake Manchukuo banknotes. He was filled with resentment and could not be suppressed. After a vote, it was decided that informants would be generously rewarded if the evidence was verified, and the informant's secret would be kept. The area was divided into three districts, and six inspectors were elected on the day of the oath to be responsible for segmented inspections. The organization is very strict and can be called the most effective association in stopping fake Manchukuo banknotes. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.

### Filipino Aviator Carlf Arrives in Shanghai from the Philippines

Carlf is the First Person from the Philippines to Fly a Plane Abroad; Won an Honorary Medal in Spain Last Year

According to sources from the American community in this city, Major Carlf of the Philippine Army Air Corps has arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines. Carlf is the first person from the Philippines to fly a plane abroad. According to Carlf, in view of the rapid progress in China's aviation construction in recent years, he came to visit. After arriving in Shanghai, he plans to visit various places to inspect the status of aviation construction. It is reported that on May 29th of last year, Carlf and another Filipino aviator flew from Little Luzon to Madrid, Spain, and were warmly welcomed by the local people. A week later, the Spanish war broke out, but Carlf and others still stayed in Spain and did not return to the Philippines until August 30th. As for Carlf's plane, it remained in Madrid for repairs. It is said that Carlf is now planning to ship the plane back to Little Luzon. When Carlf returned to the Philippines from Spain last August, he was warmly received by Philippine President Quezon and other groups. It is also learned that Carlf had planned to fly from the Philippines to Spain as early as 1925. After Spanish aviator Gallarza flew from Spain to Little Luzon in 1926, Carlf's determination to fly west became even stronger. With the help of all parties, he finally achieved his wish. Before departure, Carlf's plane was named the Republic of the Philippines. Carlf began studying aviation in the United States in 1918 and graduated two years later. Carlf believes that the Philippines has many islands, and the only effective tool for transportation is air transport. Currently, there are aviation stations on various islands, and the Philippines is actively expanding its air force, and it is expected to become one of the world's strongest air forces in ten years. It is also reported that Carlf received many honorary medals from the Spanish government while in Spain.

### Large Group of Robbers Receive Varying Sentences

Ten Robbers Involved in Other Cases in the Interior; Shanghai Police Request Transfer

After investigation by the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police, Chief Inspectors Wei Lukui, Detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Zhu Shoulung, Wang Chengying, and Detective Yang Xiguang, a large group of serious robbers was discovered hiding within the Settlement, plotting mischief. Suspects were arrested at No. 495 North Szechuan Road, the Great Ming Hotel, and other locations. The arrested were Wang Er'a, Guo Xiaosanzi, Li Changsheng, Ding Jutang (also known as Changbiao), Wang Jieqi, Yang Dianhua, Yang Shengshi, Ding Gaoshi, Chen Ruzhen, Li Guisheng, Li Xilin, Xu Zhimin, Wang Zhiqing, Li Dachengzi, Tao Ruhong (also known as Xiao Kuizi, Xiao Erzi), Zhao Guohua (also known as Baichu), Zhao Xiongshi, Zhou Changlin, Liu Shaohua, and Yuan Zhenqing, twenty individuals in total, male and female. Three handguns and twenty-one bullets were confiscated, along with two counterfeit presses. A large number of reactionary documents, maps, and military deployment surveys of Jiangsu Province were also discovered at Yang Dianhua's residence. Further investigation revealed that Yang Dianhua and Ding Jutang were the leaders of these twenty individuals. Yang and Ding originally belonged to Liu Luyin's organization, engaging in various activities intended to subvert the government. After Liu was arrested, the party's financial sources were cut off, and they resorted to robbing people everywhere. They planned to rob Suzhou but were arrested by the detectives. After being brought before the First Special District Court for trial, the Public Concession Police charged defendants one, two, three, four, five, ten, twelve, fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen with crimes under Articles 187, 199, and 330 of the Criminal Code. The hearing was postponed on record. Judge Feng Shide ruled that Yang Dianhua, Li Jinlin, Wang Zhiqing, Zhou Changlin, Liu Shaohua, and Yuan Zhenqing, along with relevant evidence, should be handed over to officials from the Songhu Garrison Command to be taken away, and that Yang Shengshi, Ding Gaoshi, Chen Ruzhen, Zhao Xiongshi, and four other women should be released. These details have already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the ten defendants, including Wang Er'a, were due for a continued hearing. The Public Concession Police again escorted the suspects to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. After the Public Concession Police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, reported the investigation, Judge Feng reviewed the case and immediately pronounced the judgment in court. Wang Er'a and Guo Xiaozhuzi were each sentenced to seven months of imprisonment for jointly possessing military firearms and ammunition without permission. Zhao Guohua was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for the same crime. If commuted to a fine, it would be two yuan per day. Ding Jutang was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for the same crime. Li Dachengzi and Tao Ruhong were each sentenced to six years and six months of imprisonment for armed robbery in a group of three or more people carrying weapons. Li Changsheng was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for the same crime. Xu Zhimin was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for intending to jointly counterfeit currency and possessing manufacturing equipment. Wang Jieqi and Li Guitang were found not guilty. After the sentencing, Xu Pengfei, the deputy leader of the Garrison Command, arrived in court to request the transfer of the defendants, as they had committed other crimes in the interior. Public Concession Police lawyer Ru did not object. Judge Feng then approved the transfer of the ten, including Wang Er'a, to officials from the Songhu Garrison Command to be taken away for further investigation and prosecution. The three confiscated handguns were also transferred.

### Female Infant Corpse Discovered on Rue Massenet

Chest and Abdomen Sliced Open, Internal Organs Exposed

At 11:30 AM yesterday, the corpse of a newly born female infant was discovered abandoned in front of No. 20 Rue Massenet in the French Concession. The chest and abdomen had been sliced open with a knife, exposing the internal organs. The scene was too gruesome to bear. A police officer reported the finding to the local police station, who dispatched personnel to transport the corpse to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for examination. A report will be filed with the Second Special District Court today to dispatch personnel to examine it. According to general speculation, it is feared that superstitious individuals, due to repeated births resulting in infertility and premature death, resorted to this heinous act in the hope that the next birth would not be a reincarnation of the previous child, and that the child would be raised to adulthood. Others say it could be the result of illegitimate birth and desperation. The truth is unclear.

### Numerous Cargo Items Destroyed in Shipping Bureau Fire

11,171 Bales of Machine Cotton, 8,004 Bags of Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grains, Estimated Loss of 1.65 Million Yuan

The new warehouse at the Pudong Yangjiadu Wharf of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company caught fire the day before yesterday and continued to burn until yesterday afternoon. Embers were still smoldering, and fire hoses were still in use. Warehouses No. 5 and 6 were completely destroyed. The cause of the fire is still unknown, but it is known that the fire started on the upper floor and then spread to the lower level. Warehouse No. 6 contained 4,988 bales of wood machine cotton (also known as loose cotton) transported from the Longhai Railway. Warehouse No. 5 contained 5,163 bales of iron machine cotton (also known as foreign batting). Wood machine cotton is valued at 100 yuan per bale, while iron machine cotton is valued at 200 yuan per bale. In addition, 2,543 bags of wheat, 205 bags of sesame, 862 bags of soybeans, 6,894 bags of white rice, and 10 pieces of miscellaneous goods were unloaded from the Jianghua steamer and stored in the warehouse. Yesterday, reporters inquired about the losses from the fire, and it was estimated that at least 1.65 million yuan worth of goods were destroyed. The loss of the warehouses themselves is estimated at 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Jin Duo, the warehouse director of the company, personally inspected the new warehouse twice but was unable to determine the cause of the fire. Some say it was due to electrical issues (because the buildings were too old), while others say that wood machine cotton, after becoming damp and then exposed to the scorching heat, has the potential to spontaneously combust. Most of the goods in the warehouse that were transported from the Longhai Railway had fire insurance. Yesterday, various insurance companies sent personnel to inspect the warehouse. The company is conducting a thorough investigation into the incident.

### Shanghai Cultural Community Launches Movement to Revoke Settlement Censorship of Opera and Film

Reception for the Press Yesterday, Inaugural Meeting Tomorrow

The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Cultural Community's Movement to Revoke the Settlement's Right to Censor Opera and Film hosted a reception for the Shanghai press at 4:00 PM yesterday in the regular meeting room of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from cultural organizations and the film production industry, including Zhou Chuangyun, and over sixty reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers attended. Zhou Jianyun, the chairman, first reported on the preparations and the significance of the organization. Representatives from various fields, including Guan Lu, Ying Yunwei, and Lu Juewu, subsequently reported. Finally, it was decided that an inaugural meeting would be held at the same location (Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce) at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 11th). The details of the proceedings are recorded below.

Participating Organizations

The organizations that participated yesterday included the Film Production Industry Association, represented by Zhou Jianyun and Ren Jinpin; the Drama Troupe Friendship Association, represented by A Ying and Ying Yunwei; the China Arts Association, represented by Wu Han and Zhou Hanmei; the Pen Club, represented by Yao Shennong; the Drama Authors Association, represented by You Jing; the General Education Film Association, represented by Lu Juewu; and over sixty reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers.

Chairman's Report

Zhou Jianyun, chairman of the Preparatory Committee, reported that the difficulties faced by Shanghai songs, operas, and films in the Settlement were entirely due to the Settlement authorities forgetting that their position was that of a Settlement and treating them entirely as a colony. They had no concept of the entire Chinese nation and denied the existence of a unified censorship system in other countries. It was already inappropriate that Chinese films and operas, having passed the Central Government's censorship, still had to be censored by the Settlement. Furthermore, the Settlement's censorship was based entirely on personal likes and dislikes and was not based on any rational principle, which was particularly unfair. Especially since the September 18th Incident, emphasis was placed on deleting anything with national defense significance from Chinese films. Unreasonable deletions of words and intentional nitpicking were pushed to the extreme. Words like "September 18th" and "January 28th," maps of the four northeastern provinces, and patriotic songs were all deleted. This was particularly painful. The unlimited censorship time was even more painful. Recently, the Settlement authorities, without censoring the Japanese film "New Land," even protected its release by sending secret agents. Everyone knew that "New Land" was China's "Old Land." The degree of pain we felt about the public release of this film was indescribable. All of this proves that the Settlement's censorship of film, opera, and songs is an unfair and illegal organization. At a time when people throughout the country are working hard for revival, we have launched this movement and hope that all sectors of society will respond in unison. We especially hope that the press will provide maximum publicity and impose stern public opinion sanctions.

Reports from Various Sectors

Guan Lu, representing the Songwriters Association, reported that modern Chinese songs have evolved from decadent tunes to national songs. However, the Settlement authorities' unreasonable deletions of these new songs are hindering the development of our patriotic songs, which is infuriating. Ying Yunwei, representing the Drama Troupe Friendship Association, began by listing the Settlement authorities' facts of fully protecting Japan's censorship of various films, operas, and songs. For example, a female secretary from the Japanese Consulate was specially invited to review "Soaring Aspirations." The Settlement's film censorship authorities' weakness and improper handling are evident from this. Finally, Lu Juewu, representing the General Education Film Association, delivered a speech expressing two hopes: ㊀ that film, opera, and songs occupy a very important position in today's cultural community, and that the press will do its best to promote them; ㊁ that at the inaugural meeting, there would be concrete measures taken to persevere to the end, without stopping until the goal is achieved.

Inaugural Meeting

Finally, the Preparatory Committee members present held a meeting and decided to hold an inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 11th), still in the regular meeting room of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, to discuss various proposals, including the adoption of a constitution, the issuance of a declaration, the determination of a location, and the election of staff.

### Rabid Dog Bites Owner, Poison Takes Life

Wu Shigen, a farmer from No. 3 Chihe Circle, North of Caohejing Town in Western Shanghai, was bitten on the back of the hand by his dog in February of this year. He did not pay much attention to it at first. Later, because the dog never returned, he became slightly concerned and went to a dye shop in Shanghai to have it tested for poison. He was assured that it was not poisonous and returned to work. Unexpectedly, after a long time, he suddenly became ill with the poison on the afternoon of the previous (8th) day, moaning. Soon after, he began grinding his teeth, rolling on the ground, and acting like a rabid dog. His mother, Lu, inadvertently got bitten on the arm, causing profuse bleeding. His family was afraid to approach him. He died at 8:00 PM. The reporter discovered that three members of the Wu family in the area had died from rabid dog bites: ㊀ Wu Sanhe, the deceased's father, died five years ago from a dog bite; ㊁ Wu Fengxiang, the deceased's cousin, was also killed by his dog in July of last year. This time, Wu Shigen was bitten to death. These repeated incidents, occurring in exactly the same way, are truly remarkable.

### Baoshan Native Association Cables Request to Suspend the Levying of Baoshan House Tax

The Baoshan Native Association in Shanghai and various public organizations in Baoshan learned that the county government had dispatched police to investigate house prices on a household-by-household basis and was about to levy a house tax. The organizations, citing the county's remote location, impoverished people, barren land, repeated military disasters, and difficult business conditions, believed the tax burden would be unbearable. Yesterday, they sent telegrams appealing for a halt to the tax.

### Actors Wang Lanfang and Wife Arrested for Trafficking Women

Three Victims Recount Their Experiences; Defendants' Statements are Deceptive and Evasive

Wang Lanfang (age 26, residing in Tanziwan), a Dan actress at the Jianghuai Opera House in Zhabei New Stage, and his wife, Zheng Jinmei (age 21), specialized in trafficking women, a practice referred to as "贩条子" (selling strips). Zheng Jinmei previously worked at a yarn factory, where she became acquainted with Zhou Chenzhaodi (age 21, wife of Zhou Dasizi, residing at No. 328 Xiaomuqiao, Yangshupu) and Chen Xiaoerzi (age 19, wife of Kuai Xiaosizi), who were also factory workers. On June 10th of this year, Wang Lanfang and Zheng Jinmei decided to abduct the two women for profit. Zheng Jinmei approached Zhou Chenzhaodi and Chen Xiaoerzi at the entrance of the Wing On Cotton Mill, falsely claiming that the wages in Hankou were excellent, and persuaded them to agree. They met Wang Lanfang at the New Stage. At that time, another female worker, Yin Wangxiuzi, had come to Shanghai from Suzhou to find a friend. Wang Lanfang and Zheng Jinmei made the same claims to Xiuzi, again using the pretext of excellent wages in Hankou, and fraudulently persuaded her to agree. They led the three women to the home of Tang Desheng and Tang Zhangshi, a married couple at No. 1480 Xiaosadu Road, Xinzha Road. Tang Desheng and Tang Zhangshi sent them to the Sanyi Inn on Xinzha Road to stay overnight. Li Zengshan and Ding Yucai, who ran a brothel at No. 11 Xihuayuan, Anqing, came to Shanghai on the Xiangyangwan steamer to purchase prostitutes. Shi Jingyuan, a steward on the steamer, introduced Wang Lanfang to them at the Yongxiang Inn on Pingqiao Road. Wang Lanfang and Zheng Jinmei then led the three women to the Yongxiang Inn to meet Li Zengshan and Ding Yucai. They agreed on a price of 80 yuan for Zhou Chenzhaodi, with 35 yuan paid in advance. They had her hair permed and bought her high-heeled leather shoes. On the 13th (the abolished Lunar Dragon Boat Festival), they took her to Anqing on the Xiangyangwan steamer to work as a prostitute. Zheng Yuemei took the other two women, Chen Xiaoerzi and Yin Wangxiuzi, on the same ship to Hankou to sell them separately. A watchman at the Risheng Company, finding the situation suspicious, reported it to Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the Relief Association at the pier. They worked with the Water Police to board the ship and discovered the whole plan. They rushed to the New Stage, where Wang Lanfang was performing the role of the White Lady in the timely play "Legend of the White Snake," and arrested him. The Tang Desheng couple was also apprehended and sent to the District Court for detention. The abducted Zhou Chenzhaodi and Chen Xiaoerzi were claimed by their families. Because Yin Wangxiuzi had no family, she was sent to the Relief Association for care. The prosecutor, having determined the facts clearly, filed a public prosecution based on the aforementioned circumstances. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu presided over the trial. Attorney Zhou Yu defended the defendants. The first to be questioned was victim Zhou Chenzhaodi, who testified that she was familiar with Zheng Jinmei. Zheng Jinmei told her that working in Hankou would pay more than one yuan a day. At the end of the fourth lunar month, she took Chen Xiaoerzi and me. No one at home knew. She said there was no need to notify them until we got to Hankou, and then we could write a letter. We first went to the Sanyi Inn. Wang Lanfang, Zheng Jinmei, Tang Desheng, Yin Wangxiuzi, Chen Xiaoerzi, and I lived there, six people in total, for two days, sharing one room. The four of us slept on one bed, and Wang Lanfang and Zheng Jinmei slept on the floorboards. Then we went to the Yongxiang Inn to wait for the ship to Hankou. Later, Li Zengshan, Ding Yucai, Shi Jingyuan, and others came to see us. We boarded the ship on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. We did not know we were being sold before, but Li Zengshan paid for the perming and the leather shoes before boarding the ship. Zheng Jinmei took us to the hairdresser, and so on. Chen Xiaoerzi and Yin Wangxiuzi gave similar testimony. When questioned, the defendants were either evasive, attempting to downplay their involvement, or simply denied everything. The Tang Desheng couple even claimed that they had been to the police station with Wang Lanfang before because of a fight, and that this time he falsely implicated them in his confession. However, because the judge had the victims identify them and they were not mistaken, and because the defendants had raised defenses, it was necessary to conduct further investigation. Therefore, the judge ordered the case to be continued and the defendants remanded.

### Wang Baofa, Who Fell and Was Injured, Dies

Wang Baofa, a native of Ningbo, age 28, collapsed in front of No. 19 Route Lafayette in the French Concession on the afternoon of May 16th of this year. A police officer reported it, and the police sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, Wang, due to a nervous disorder, jumped from the window of his fourth-floor hospital room at noon the next day, falling to the ground and injuring his limbs internally. Orderlies and nurses discovered him and carried him back to his room for treatment. After two months without recovery, he died at 6:00 AM yesterday.

### Tragic Gang Fight on Yangshupu Road and Meizhou Road

Over 300 People Involved, One Dead, Six Injured, Over Ten Arrested

Near Heng Deli, Yangshupu Road and Meizhou Road (near Liaoyang Road) in Eastern Shanghai, over 300 gangsters suddenly gathered last night around 8:00 PM, armed and fighting. The two sides initially waited defensively, then made contact. At the time, traffic in the area was almost completely blocked. As a result of the melee, one person died on the spot, and six were seriously injured. According to the newspaper's investigation, the deceased was Zhang Haikun, a Jiangbei native and police officer No. 1895 from the Laoza Police Station, who suffered over ten knife wounds. The six injured were Zhou Xiaocun (Ningbo native) with one knife wound to the shoulder, Chen Xiaolin with four knife wounds, Shen Zaolian with one head wound, Tu Changchang with six knife wounds, Qiu Jiuxin with two knife wounds, and police officer No. 2944 with one knife wound to the waist. When the police were alerted, they dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives who arrived and apprehended over ten rioters, who were taken to the police station for investigation. The deceased was taken to the morgue on Avenue Petain for autopsy. The injured were all sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. The cause of the conflict was that a gangster surnamed Qin, riding a bicycle, passed through the area the night before. Another gangster stopped Qin and tried to borrow the bike. When Qin refused, an argument ensued. The two sides then agreed to gather their gangs for a fight at the location last night around 8:00 PM, which led to the tragedy.

### Dr. Shen Zhongfang's Medical Achievements in Pediatrics

Shen Zhongfang, a renowned pediatrician, is meticulous in his diagnosis and possesses unique insights. For example, the niece of lawyer Lou Ying suffered from mental confusion, with seizures dozens of times day and night, nearing death.

Hua Peirong, a gentleman from the Xinwen Daily, suddenly suffered a strange illness resembling meningitis, with a blank stare and inability to bow his head. He suffered from urinary retention and severe pain. Dr. Shen used a large dose of wind-dispelling, collateral-clearing, blood-stasis-removing, and tendon-nourishing medicine, and he recovered. The second daughter of Mr. Hu Siwu suffered from shortness of breath, limb spasms, and a stiff neck bent backward, almost forming an arc. Dr. Shen administered medicines containing antelope horn and fangfeng, and the wind subsided and her spirit revived. Zhang Songshou, a resident of No. 12 Gui Fu Lane, Danshui Road, had a grandson suffering from sha (sudden infantile fever), diarrhea, and dysentery. Dr. Shen administered mahuang and gegen to relax the muscles and promote sweating. After the sha receded, the diarrhea and dysentery did not stop, so he administered warm and tonifying medicines such as Fuzi Guizhi Paojiang and Renshu, and he gradually recovered. Li Kangnian, manager of the Wang Quanji Pharmacy, suffered from severe whooping cough, with shortness of breath, fever, and insomnia day and night. Dr. Shen diagnosed and treated him with shegan and ziwancao and other medications, and he gradually recovered. The son of Zhao Jing from Xiang Kang Li suffered from vomiting and diarrhea, exhaustion, and cold limbs. The condition was critical. He was treated with Lai Fu Dan and other medications, and he suddenly recovered completely. The young son of Mr. Jing Yimen, who works at Hua An Insurance Company, and the niece of Mr. Huang from this newspaper, one suffered from sha, and the other suffered from damp-heat fever with sha. Both recovered after a few doses. Dr. Shen's use of warm and cool medicines, with a balance between attacking and tonifying, accurately addresses the underlying mechanisms of disease and is truly a good doctor.

### A Study of the National Assembly and Women's Suffrage (Continued)

— Hu Lan

For five thousand years, Chinese society has generally known only male superiority and female inferiority. What was emphasized was the three obediences and four virtues, and what was learned was housework and needlework. Women themselves, under coercion, did not even know of the advocacy of women's rights. The government and the people did not promote women's rights. As a result, the intelligence and abilities of half of the women were imprisoned and could not be developed. As a result, most women lived a muddled life until today, when women have greatly awakened and believe that women are members of the nation and naturally have civil qualifications. Since they are citizens, they should have equal treatment and the right to vote and be elected. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in view of the principle of equality between men and women in the republican countries of the powers, wrote the foundation of the country in the party platform. Therefore, since our party's revolution, we have followed the teachings of the Premier and formulated laws for equality between men and women, implemented education for equality between men and women, and created a society for equality between men and women. The status of women has increased compared to the past. However, in this first national election of the fundamental law of the country, women are not allowed to participate, making it impossible to express the representation of our national politics and the public opinion of our half of women's rights. This is a violation of the Premier's legacy of building the country. Compared to the precedents of advanced countries in Europe and the United States, we are lagging behind. Even if it is explained by the true meaning of the National Assembly Election Law without gender, it is still not in line. The representative assembly is the organ that represents the true public opinion. Women representatives can solve their own problems. Objectively speaking, the development of women's rights and the realization of the principle of equality between men and women, and subjectively speaking, the interests of women can be represented and extended. If, in the process of preparing for the National Assembly election, there is no news of women's campaigns and no one is elected in the preliminary elections for women, the right of the whole people to formulate a constitution can only represent the public opinion of half of the men, and the public opinion of half of the women cannot be expressed. Is it in line with the true meaning of a republican country? However, the preliminary election has been completed, competition is lacking, women's rights are at ease, and there is a way to remedy it. According to Article 2 of the revised National Assembly Representative Election Law, in addition to the natural representatives, regional elections, occupational elections, and special elections, the fourth section has "240 people designated by the National Government." Does the government see that there are only representatives of male rights in the country and cannot bear to deprive the two hundred million women of the right to represent civil rights? Therefore, this quota is set to designate women representatives? Or is it feared that scholars and talents are unwilling to run for election or there are omissions? Therefore, this quota is set to designate them and avoid the regret of missing pearls? Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, when women's schools were established, there have been countless women with extraordinary talents and abilities. There are countless outstanding women who have graduated from domestic and foreign universities. There are many political experts, legal experts, educational experts, and economic experts in the world who are qualified to participate in politics. Compared with Europe and the United States, we are not far behind. How can we say that the spirits of mountains and rivers are not concentrated on women and that women's abilities are not as good as men's? Even if the designated representatives are 240, all of them are women. In terms of the whole country, it will not feel the difficulty of talent. Now the National Assembly is about to open, and the designated election is about to be held. In order for our women's community to fight for personality and civil rights, we should obtain the qualification of the two hundred million women representatives in this national politics, and start using the blueprint to plan the status of women's participation in politics. Then the development of women's rights in our country may have hope. It is hoped that the government will not only shout slogans of women's liberation, women's participation in politics, and equality between men and women, but will implement the legacy of the founding Premier of the Republic of China, confirm the principle of equality between men and women, be fair and impartial, and establish this fundamental law formulated by the four hundred million people, as the foundation for building the country.

Commentary

### The Lugouqiao Incident Resolved Peacefully

— Zhong

The Lugouqiao Incident, after an exchange of fire between the two sides for a day and night, was resolved peacefully at 4:00 AM yesterday through talks between Qin Dechun and Imai Kazuo. Chinese and Japanese troops withdrew simultaneously. Wanping City was taken over by Shi Yousan's security team. Although the battle has been temporarily resolved, this kind of resolution is still a temporary measure, and I am afraid it cannot be considered settled. Because no matter what happens, it must be settled and a truth sought.

First, the responsible party for the initial quarrel must be clarified. In this incident, the Japanese side used the excuse that during night combat exercises, they suddenly heard gunshots and one soldier was missing, and insisted on entering the city to search. However, whether the gun was fired or not, and whether the soldier was missing or not, only Heaven can bear witness to this. How can we know it? It is not like the Zang Ben missing incident. Once Zang Ben's whereabouts are found, the matter will be clear. If the missing of soldiers and the opening of firearms, who heard it, and who saw it, then the responsibility lies in the difficulty of clarifying.

Second, the condition for this reconciliation method is that Chinese and Japanese troops withdraw simultaneously, and Shi Yousan's security team fills the defense. Why is this? Wanping is our country's territory. Our country's troops stationed in our country's territory have absolute sovereignty. Why must they also withdraw this time? This kind of withdrawal method is nominally a mutual withdrawal, but in fact, it is the withdrawal of our country's troops. Moreover, this Lugouqiao incident was entirely caused by their provocation, and our side is not responsible. Therefore, the withdrawal of Japanese troops is acceptable, but the withdrawal of our troops is unacceptable. It is called a peaceful resolution, but our side has already suffered a lot. We should not recognize this unreasonable condition.

Third, the Japanese side has long advocated the specialization and clarification of North China. Because our government has resolutely refused, it has not yet succeeded. However, the abnormal development of North China, the omnipresence and activity of traitors and vagrants, coupled with night combat exercises, street combat exercises, and airplane and tank exercises, are all preparations for aggression and demonstrations that are known to passersby. Now, the Lugouqiao incident is of the same nature as the Fengtai incident. There is no possibility of expansion. The other side does not want to seek its expansion. Their policy is originally like this.

Now the Japanese side's policy of aggression is to use an inch to gain an inch, step by step. As before, they used little force and achieved great success. Therefore, on the one hand, they sent troops to attack under false pretenses, and on the other hand, they declared that the situation would not expand. No matter how important the matter is, as long as it is considered a local incident, it can be resolved peacefully. Without knowing it, the well-behaved Lugouqiao has become the second Fengtai. I don't know how many Fengtais and Lugouqiaos our country has that can withstand such peaceful resolutions. It is deeply hoped that our country's authorities will not regard the current peaceful resolution method as a solution, but should more thoroughly seek a way out under the principle of not losing sovereignty and not losing territory.

### Wonderful Article on Seeking Marriage

— Li Min

This newspaper on the 7th carried a marriage advertisement that took up a lot of space. The content and text of this marriage advertisement will make you smile knowingly when you read it. This gentleman thinks so in his heart, and writes it out in his pen, which is an honest gentleman.

Every day, in the classified advertisement column of the newspaper, we see many small pieces of marriage or friend-seeking or companion advertisements. It is rare to see someone like this gentleman, spending a considerable amount of advertising fees to publish such a large marriage announcement. And the content and text of the advertisement are so interesting: there are items such as origin, works, inventions, etc. Finally, there are also: sponsors, teachers, friends and fellow villagers, etc. Readers who have not seen it should go back and take another look, I think.

Here, the motive for writing this article is not to say something about this wonderful article, which is something I should not and do not need to do. From this wonderful article, I thought of other problems.

Like this gentleman, who spent a large advertising fee to publish a large marriage announcement, this naturally hides a great hope. Not only him, but also the advertisers in the classified advertisement column every day have the same hope. We are used to seeing this thing very plainly, but behind the matter, there is a rather small sadness hidden in the current social problems between men and women. It shows that in the current society, how many young men and women cannot choose the person they can love around them. How many young people are seeking their objects, and in the middle, the unprogressive society obviously artificially builds a copper wall and iron wall, isolating the requesters on both sides. The appearance of marriage advertisements in the newspaper every day can also be said to be an assault on this isolation situation. Although this assault is also very weak.

Second, after reading this gentleman's marriage announcement, he painstakingly listed his background, works, status, and even cited three famous people to sponsor his affairs, which is not meaningless. Readers can know that the selection conditions for marriage in the current society are originally a set of rules. It shows that the combination of many men and women in the current society is not based on their mutual true love, but there is also a more important force driving them. Therefore, it also reflects that women in the present society cannot actually be independent and have to use men's money, reputation, status, etc. as the basis for their lives. This is another one.

True love can only be found in the most meaningful life practice. Only husband and wife who are also the most knowledgeable friends are the most real love. The appearance of marriage advertisements should be said to be a kind of sadness hidden behind modern men and women.

### Impression of Cao Yu

— Sa Yan

If you have seen "Thunderstorm" but not "Sunrise," I think you should be very familiar with this young playwright Cao Yu who "stunned the world."

In his "Thunderstorm," you see him satirizing, cruelly and ruthlessly exposing the ugliness of this society. He poured out the social contradictions, family darkness, and collapse in the transition period between the previous generation and this generation. You feel happy at this time. However, at the same time, you cannot help but sympathize with the misfortunes of a group of poor characters in the play.

When you watch "Thunderstorm," you are held by "Thunderstorm," and so, you cannot help but feel admiration and respect for the author of "Thunderstorm," and therefore, you have a desire to know and speculate on his personal face, character, environment, and life. You see the ability and moving of his drama, and you will think that Cao Yu is probably an old man, or a very unusual character. He is cold, he is meticulous, and he must also be unapproachable. He, he, in your "image," either becomes a monster with three heads and six arms, or he must become an old man who has tasted the coldness and warmth of life and has experienced the filtration of society.

Speculation is speculation, and imagination cannot be arbitrary. In fact, Mr. Cao Yu is completely a character that you cannot speculate. He is ordinary, he stands in a pile with ordinary people; he is young, he forms a piece with young people; he is enthusiastic, he spreads his enthusiasm to all human beings who accept the sun. He once said: "Those who abandon human beings will eventually be abandoned by human beings." Therefore, he said again: "Some people are really too good, so good that they are almost

## Page 22

stupid. Human enthusiasm often turns into coldness in stupidity, which is sad. At the same time, if you do not feel stupid and even have 'spiritual' property, you should do something within your ability for those who are unfortunate and stupid. Regardless of success or failure, regardless of merit or demerit, as long as you cultivate, cultivate, and do it purposefully, this is really urgently needed. Although the masses are stupid, they will not fail you, and even often repay you hundreds or thousands of times. When you receive this gift, in addition to shame, how ecstatic you are"!

We can know enough about him from Mr. Cao's talks. He is only 28 years old this year. He is not very healthy, and his height is average. His face is just ordinary. Under his unkempt long hair, a pair of nearsighted glasses are always on his not-so-high nose. He often smiles shyly when he sees strangers.

His demeanor has a bit of the taste of a college student, but when he speaks, he speaks eloquently, not letting first-class social activists and politicians. Moreover, he seems to often draft his words in his mind, which is called (Vorbal imags) in foreign countries. Therefore, when you listen to him carefully, you feel that his words are well-organized and coherent from beginning to end. This is certainly a good phenomenon, but it is easy to lose the personality of a young man, the common phenomenon of young people, and make people feel that he is terrible. However, on the other hand, this is exactly where ordinary young people cannot catch up with Mr. Cao. His temperament is very much like the inherent calmness of an Oriental. This is close to a scholar, but he does not have the hateful emptiness. Therefore, we can clearly see in Mr. Cao's demeanor and temperament that he is ordinary but not vulgar. He can approach the vulgar environment without being bound by vulgarity.

Recently, he told the writer that he plans to complete the third act of Wilderness and then engage in a student movement "vertical and horizontal" compilation, or a writing that re-shows the lives of the lower classes. However, in this environment in the South, he has no way. He feels that the environment in the South is not suitable, and the language and life are not "typical" images of normal Chinese people. Therefore, he believes that the North, the Tianqiao in Beiping, and the Luoma Lake in Tianjin are really endless warehouses for you to draw from.

He is now living very quietly. After teaching a few hundred minutes of screenwriting every week and directing one or two plays every year, he can write freely. Therefore, in a two-story foreign house under Beijige in Nanjing, you can often find a playwright who is buried in reading and writing all day long.

Mr. Cao's residence is a bit Japanese in style. It is simple, clean, generous, and not vulgar. There is furniture but no decorations, and there are matches but no cigarettes. The reason is that he has no such habit. In this environment, he is creating a legacy for the Chinese national spirit and making food for the human spirit. Mr. Cao Yu, a promising playwright who is taking the lead in the Chinese theater scene in the 1940s, let us silently wish him success and good health!
