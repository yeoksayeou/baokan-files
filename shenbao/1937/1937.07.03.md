### Recent Situation in Chahar North

People's Army Active, Bandits and Puppets in Panic

[Nanjing] A person from Chahar North recently told reporters about the recent situation in Chahar North, which is excerpted as follows: ⑴ Although the People's Army in Chahar North was previously defeated by the puppet army, it has now reassembled in Shangdu, Huade, and other places, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. The total number is no less than one or two thousand people. Recently, in order to prevent popular resistance, the puppet government has been collecting information about the people's militias. ⑵ The puppet army is currently in extreme panic due to the uprising of the People's Army. The puppet troops in various counties are heavily guarded, the soldiers are exhausted, and their morale is very low. ⑶ Li Shouxin was appointed as deputy commander, which he is very dissatisfied with. Therefore, his opinions differ greatly from those of Prince De, and they cannot cooperate in everything. They have temporarily reconciled after mediation by the Kwantung Army. However, his troops and the Mongolian armies are not harmonious, so their unit symbols are also inconsistent. ⑷ Apart from the Mongolians, the families of the puppet officers and soldiers are all in the Northeast. Recently, the Japanese have been conducting a clean-up campaign in the Northeast, massacring people everywhere. Many family members of the puppet officers and soldiers have also been brutally murdered, so they are all indignant against the Japanese and have a great hatred for them.

The rise in public bonds is an inevitable trend and is not due to speculation. The government will never restrict it. However, if public bond prices fall for no reason, the government will definitely maintain its credit and not allow it to fall below a considerable price. Moreover, various banks will definitely buy as much as possible. This kind of purchase is an inevitable economic reason and cannot be regarded as speculation." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 2nd)

### Shao Lizi's Radio Address: The Progress of National Consciousness

Determining the Path of Hard Work and Increasing Effort, Understanding the Wise Leaders of the Nation and People

[Nanjing] Shao Lizi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, delivered a radio address at the Central Broadcasting Station at 8:00 PM on the 2nd, titled "The Progress of National Consciousness." The original text is as follows: "The topic of my speech today is 'The Progress of National Consciousness.' I am discussing this topic in the hope that our citizens will examine their own consciousness. If we discover common progress, we can better determine the path of hard work and from then on, increase our efforts, seeking further progress within progress, and absolutely not becoming arrogant or complacent, thinking that we can be satisfied with the small amount of progress we have made.

What is Meant by National Consciousness

Refers to the common consciousness that all or at least the majority of citizens of a country have towards their nation and people. Whether a country has hope depends first and foremost on whether its citizens' common consciousness has progressed. Citizens who can recognize that everything pertaining to the nation and people is more important than everything pertaining to the individual, and who, when necessary, can sacrifice their personal opinions, rights, and even their lives to defend the survival and interests of the nation and people, are a symbol of progress in consciousness. Our citizens lacked this kind of consciousness in the past, but it has indeed progressed recently. The phenomenon of progress can be seen everywhere. Looking at the nation's understanding of diplomacy, there is evident progress. Regardless of how the diplomatic situation changes, the general public can always uphold the position of the nation and people, firmly adhere to the principle of self-reliance, and decide to build a modern country. During the process of nation-building, they will not be swayed by any temptations, knowing only to work practically. They will not be afraid of any difficulties, knowing only to work diligently.

When Others Sympathize with Us

Our citizens certainly feel it. If others' understanding of us is consistently unclear and consistently causes us to lose face, what our citizens express is only disappointment. Other than disappointment, they are determined not to deviate from the path of diplomacy and take any transgressive actions, only doing what they should do within the bounds of that path. As stated in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session, "Seeking self-reliance internally and co-existence externally" is the inherent spirit of our country's nationalism, so it easily becomes the common external consciousness of the people. This consciousness has been demonstrated in all aspects over the past year. Although foreign affairs are extremely difficult, responses have not gone beyond the scope. Despite the harassment by bandits and puppets, we are still resolving the situation on the correct footing. During the Xi'an Incident, although there were many slogans inciting people's hearts, the citizens remained unshaken. It can be determined that under any circumstances, the common consciousness of the people will not be flustered.

Only Ever More Awakened

Our citizens' awakening will forever correspond to the needs of the nation and people. Looking at the nation's understanding of internal affairs, progress can be seen in all aspects. Citizens all know that the most important task at present is to build a truly unified and modern country. What has already been achieved is the establishment of central authority and the construction of a unified framework. This achievement has been unanimously supported by the people. What is currently underway is the convening of a National Assembly, the drafting of a national constitution, the establishment of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu and Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committees, the improvement of the national defense forces, the reform of the Guangdong currency system, and the reorganization of Guangxi's finances to control the national economy. The expansion of the Longhai-Chuanqian, Hangzhou-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou railways, as well as the highways in various provinces, is underway to facilitate national transportation. The promotion of rural cooperative enterprises and water conservancy projects is underway to develop the national economy. The New Life Movement is being vigorously implemented to refresh the national spirit, and the organization and training of the masses is being intensified.

Replenishing National Defense Capabilities

Because the people can recognize the value of these tasks, their progress is very smooth. At the same time, the people are all aware that the work of nation-building is just beginning and do not consider it to be complete. Although the degree of each person's understanding may not be consistent, there is generally progress, and this progress is manifested in all aspects. The Communists have also expressed their willingness to change their past behavior and fulfill their responsibilities as citizens under the leadership of the central government. Even the Chinese traitors who committed extremely heinous crimes and caused the greatest harm to the nation and people, many have gradually repented and are eagerly seeking to extricate themselves. These are all clear evidence of the progress of national consciousness. As for the progress of the national consciousness of young people, it is even more obvious. From the September 18th Incident to the success of the suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi, during this period, young people had a very poor understanding of the government.

Consciousness Extremely Incorrect

From the victory of the suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi to the unification of the two Guang provinces, during this period, young people had already recognized the country's situation and progressed from suspicion to understanding. From the unification of the two Guang provinces to the present, during this period, no matter what their ideological tendencies, young people have been able to recognize that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the wise leader of the nation and people, that unifying the country is the fundamental task for resisting foreign aggression and saving the nation, and have gone a step further from understanding the government to enthusiastically supporting the central government and helping the government. The rapid progress of the youth's consciousness has clearly had an impact on the strength of the entire nation. Just mentioning this point is enough to imagine how the nation's consciousness is growing." (To be continued)

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Japan-Soviet Union Heilongjiang Incident

— Hua

Regarding the conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan over two small islands in the Heilongjiang River on the 30th of last month. According to the initial news, the situation was very serious. But according to the development of the past two days, it does not seem to be expanding. However, this incident can be said to be a relatively major one among the constant conflicts between Japan and the Soviet Union in recent years. Because it involves the occupation of Ganqiazi and Qinanhuo Islands, and a Soviet patrol gunboat was even destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. But based on our past observations, the armed conflict between the Japanese puppet army and the Outer Mongolian army on the shore of Lake Buir last year did not escalate into a large-scale war. Therefore, it seems that this incident will not have more serious consequences.

We quietly observe the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union in recent years. I feel that although Japan and the Soviet Union are fundamentally opposed, and the Japanese warlords regard attacking the Soviet Union as a major goal, as time progresses, the entire national power of the Soviet Union and the Far Eastern defense are constantly strengthened, and the possibility of winning such a battle is becoming less and less certain. Last year, Japan tried to save its anti-Soviet military decline with the alliance with Germany. But the Soviet Union retaliated by stopping the signing of the Japan-Soviet Union Fisheries Agreement, which caused no small shock to the Japanese side. Before the fall of the Hirota cabinet at the beginning of this year, all political parties unanimously criticized the military's interference in politics. Some people also pointed out that the conclusion of the Japan-Germany alliance hindered the progress of adjusting relations with the Soviet Union, expressing great regret. These facts prove that although there are still many military fascists in Japan who hope to show their ambition against the Soviet Union, most Japanese citizens know that they cannot fight against the Soviet Union because this war will definitely not be a blessing for Japan.

But why does Japan have to provoke so many incidents against the Soviet Union? This can be explained by various reasons. The most obvious one is, as pointed out earlier, that there are still many fascist soldiers in Japan who hope to show their ambition against the Soviet Union. The Kwantung Army is a representative of this kind of people. And many incidents on the Manchu-Soviet border are related to the Kwantung Army's military survey, deployment of war equipment in northern Manchuria. Other more important reasons are in Japan's domestic politics. Provoking more incidents against the Soviet Union can show the seriousness of the military situation, thereby enhancing the military's control over political institutions. In foreign relations, creating a conflicting situation with the Soviet Union can obscure the promotion of aggression against China, giving other imperialists the illusion of an anti-Soviet war. All these things are clearly known to those who pay close attention to Japan-Soviet relations.

Recently, according to official statistics published by Japan, since 1935, there have been as many as 400 incidents of Soviet border troops "illegally crossing the border." It is estimated that there were 136 incidents in 1935, 203 incidents in 1936, and 86 incidents from January to June of this year. We, with our experience of being close to the water tower, of course know very clearly the accuracy of this report. But assuming this report is true, then Japan's tolerance of the Soviet Union can be said to be the highest record in world history. From this record, we can also predict that this Heilongjiang incident will not escalate seriously.

Finally, we should point out that in this dispute over the two small islands in the Heilongjiang River, Japan and the Soviet Union each have their own arguments, and it is definitely not as the Japanese propaganda says, that it was the "border intrusion" of the Soviet border troops. But we feel that it is not worth judging the merits of this kind of right and wrong. We believe that for this so-called "Japan-Soviet Union" or "Manchu-Soviet" conflict, China should only maintain one position, that is, the four northeastern provinces are Chinese land. The so-called Manchukuo puppet state, China does not recognize that thing at all. This border conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union is caused by its own aggression against our country's land. The so-called "illegal border crossing" is like this large-scale aggression of land is the real illegal border crossing. Therefore, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov pointed out in his reply to the protest of Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Kui that the 1860 Treaty of Beijing contains the division of islands in the Heilongjiang River on the red line on the map, but this treaty and map are in the custody of the Chinese government. This clever reply should be a profound satire on the "illegal border crossers."

### Japan-Russia Dispute, Three Negotiations Unsuccessful

Stalemate Between Both Sides on Troop Withdrawal, US Ambassador Advises to Prevent Deterioration

[Tokyo] The tense atmosphere caused by the Ganqiazi Island incident still shows no signs of easing. There is still no news about the outcome of the third meeting between Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigemitsu Kui and Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov. A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated this morning that it is still difficult to predict when a new dispute will occur. The two islands are still under the armed occupation of the Soviet Union. Although it is rumored that merchant ships have been able to pass through the waterways north of the two islands, no news has been received from the responsible parties. The Foreign Ministry sincerely hopes that the situation will not escalate again. However, it is not yet known whether the army and navy authorities have already issued special instructions to the local troops to be particularly cautious and avoid escalating the situation. Japan's biggest demand at present is to restore the two islands to their original state. As for whether Japan and Manchukuo will station troops on the two islands after the restoration of the original state, it is a military decree under the power of the Japanese Emperor and cannot be predicted. Although Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov has indeed agreed to withdraw Soviet troops from the two islands only if Japan and Manchukuo also withdraw their armed forces near the two islands, since this problem was caused by the Soviet army occupying the two islands, the solution should naturally start with the Soviet Union's complete withdrawal of troops. Regarding the news that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Davis advised Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu not to escalate the situation, the spokesman said that he had not received a formal report from Shigemitsu, so the Japanese government could not comment on the matter. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Moscow] After meeting with Litvinov on the afternoon of the 1st, Ambassador Shigemitsu told reporters, "I met with Mr. Litvinov, conveyed the Japanese government's views on the Ganqiazi incident, and announced that the solution to this incident requires the Soviet army to immediately withdraw from the occupied area, and pointed out the provocative behavior of the Soviet gunboat on the 30th, and argued that such actions cannot promote the resolution of this incident. I also protested against the Soviet Foreign Ministry's serious inspection of all news telegrams announcing this incident, and in fact prohibited the sending of telegrams." (Japanese Allied Telegraph)

[Moscow] US Ambassador to Moscow Davis visited Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu at noon on the 1st to express his views on the Ganqiazi Island incident, saying, "I have not received instructions from my government, but as a friend of yours, I hope that you will limit this incident to a local problem as much as possible to prevent its escalation and maintain peace in the Far East." Shigemitsu understood Davis's good intentions. After half an hour, Davis left. Davis also agreed to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov today, but it has been temporarily postponed due to Litvinov's busy official duties.

[Washington] According to Undersecretary of State Welles, as far as the State Department's information is concerned, the dispute between Japan and Russia over the two islands in the Heilongjiang River is still just a border dispute. The State Department does not need to express any opinions at present. Neutral observers here do not believe that there is a possibility of war, but they predict that negotiations between the two sides will take a long time. (1st National Telegram)

[New York] The New York Times recently commented on the Far Eastern situation, saying, "The turbulent situation in Europe provides Japan with an opportunity to advance to the mainland. As for Soviet Russia, since the purge of the party and the military, there is no internal disunity. It can also use this adventurous move by Japan to call on the people to unite and defend the motherland." The Minsheng Jiangtan newspaper截称, "The Japanese military wants to use Asian security as a tool to test the country's national strength. The country's political situation has already been disturbed as a result. If it can provoke the Soviet Union at a very small price and prove the strength of the country, the government may even allow the military to do whatever it wants, in order to resolve internal tensions." (Central News Agency 1st Havas)

### Moscow Negotiations Process

Joint Japanese and Soviet Communiqué

[Moscow] Regarding the incident of the Soviet gunboat being bombed on the Heilongjiang River, Deputy Foreign Affairs Commissioner Stomoniakov immediately lodged a strong protest with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru on the same day. At that time, Shigemitsu also counter-protested, claiming that the Soviet gunboat had sailed into the southern channel of Gan’anzigui Island and fired first, but this was rejected by Stomoniakov.

During a conversation with Shigemitsu on July 1st, Litvinov reiterated the oral protest regarding the incident, pointing out that such actions by the Japanese-Manchukuo authorities could lead to serious consequences. He stated that the Soviet government reserved the right to demand compensation for material losses and casualties. Litvinov declared that if the Japanese-Manchukuo side was willing to provide the same guarantees, or had in fact already withdrawn its warships, the Soviet government would also be prepared to immediately withdraw its troops and gunboats. Litvinov then reiterated the suggestion he had previously made, advocating for the commencement of negotiations to redraw the Heilongjiang border. However, Shigemitsu again raised the issue of the so-called illegal occupation of islands by Soviet troops. Litvinov replied that the current dispute over the legality of the Soviet sentries stationed on the islands, and the question of which country the islands belonged to, was meaningless, as both sides had their own views. Ultimately, right and wrong must be proven through future negotiations. We can say that if only Soviet gunboats were patrolling near the Soviet islands, disputes would not arise. Therefore, the current tense situation was caused by the arrival of Japanese-Manchukuo warships in the area. However, such disputes will never reach a conclusion. If we talk about restoring the previous situation, then at that time neither side had gunboats stationed there. If the Soviet side withdraws its troops but the Japanese side does not, or if the Japanese side withdraws but the Soviet side does not, the previous situation cannot be restored; instead, a new situation will be created. Therefore, the troops of both sides must withdraw in the same way in order to restore the original state and eliminate the tense situation. Currently, if your Excellency the Ambassador can resolutely agree that the Japanese side can issue an order to withdraw troops, the Soviet side can immediately issue the same order. If the Japanese-Manchukuo gunboats have indeed withdrawn from the area, as your Excellency the Ambassador has said, then I can guarantee to your Excellency that the Soviet sentries and fleet will also withdraw immediately, and the problem will naturally disappear.

The Japanese ambassador agreed to consider this suggestion and continue negotiations the following day. (July 2nd TASS dispatch)

[Tokyo] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Moscow on the 2nd, detailing the meeting between Ambassador Shigemitsu and Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Stomoniakov from 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM on the 1st. The contents are recorded on the left:

Ambassador Shigemitsu stated that the incident of the Soviet speedboat illegally entering the southern waterway of Gan’anzigui Island and indiscriminately firing was contrary to the facts agreed upon yesterday (June 30th) by Commissar Litvinov. This is an act of bad faith, so we lodge a strong protest. At the same time, all responsibilities arising from such illegal acts should be borne by the Soviet side. As for what Litvinov has admitted, your country should immediately withdraw its forces and restore the original state, so as not to hinder navigation on the Heilongjiang River.

Deputy Commissar Stomoniakov, in a defensive manner, argued that the hostile acts were initiated by the Manchukuo side, and that such actions were a violation of the understanding between Shigemitsu and Litvinov. As for the Soviet gunboat entering the Manchukuo side’s waterway, it does not hinder the rights claimed by the Japanese and Manchukuo sides to pass through the Soviet waterway. What Commissar Litvinov proposed was that both the Japanese-Manchukuo and Soviet sides withdraw simultaneously, and it was not agreed that only the Soviet side would withdraw. Ambassador Shigemitsu continued that the Soviet gunboat’s intrusion into the disputed "Manchukuo" territorial waters to attack the garrison troops at a time of border tension was a major act of provocation. Litvinov wished to remove Soviet forces from the two islands in order to eliminate obstacles to navigation on nearby waterways, so there was no objection to the withdrawal of the gunboat, and an understanding had been reached. Litvinov also said that the withdrawal could be limited to a certain period. Now your Deputy Commissar says that Litvinov did not agree to a one-sided withdrawal, but only proposed a simultaneous withdrawal by both sides. Little does he know that the Soviet side caused the incident by infringing on "Manchukuo" territory, so we are demanding the restoration of the original state, and the Japanese-Manchukuo side has not illegally occupied anything. Therefore, even if we wanted to withdraw, what reason is there to withdraw?

After this rebuttal, no key points were obtained, and they had to separate temporarily. (July 2nd Allied Press)

### Soviet Union Refuses to Meet with Manchukuo Representative

[Changchun] After the Gan’anzigui incident occurred, the "Manchukuo" Foreign Affairs Bureau immediately telegraphed Shi Liben, the Special Envoy to Harbin, instructing him to make a serious protest to Soviet Acting Consul-General Kitzniakov, forwarding it to the Soviet side. However, all the staff of the Soviet Consulate General claimed to be ill and refused to meet. Shi then issued a warning and requested the Acting Consul-General to visit, but the response was that he was not at home. Shi had no choice but to notify his secretary of this intention by telephone. (July 2nd Allied Press dispatch)

### Eastern Newspaper Commentary

Advising the Government to Adopt a Peaceful Attitude to Avoid Escalating the Incident

[Tokyo] Today, the commentaries in various newspapers here on the Gan’anzigui incident are roughly as follows: The Asahi Shimbun's editorial, quoting an editorial from the New York Times, advises the government to adopt a peaceful attitude. (Note: The New York Times editorial stated that world opinion suspects that Japan may take advantage of the serious situation in Europe to realize its ambitions.) The newspaper also proposed that if the Soviet Union sincerely withdraws its troops, the Japanese government will maintain its original policy and negotiate through diplomatic channels, so that people around the world can understand Japan's attitude. The Hochi Shimbun's editorial criticized the Soviet Union's constant incursions into Manchukuo territory and provocative behavior, and advised the Soviet Union not to make the situation worse and to abandon the islands it has already occupied. Otherwise, unfortunate incidents may happen again. After attempting to speculate on the Soviet Union's motives, the Miyako Shimbun also demanded that the Soviet Union quickly withdraw its troops, but further suggested that the fundamental solution is to resume negotiations on redrawing the border as soon as possible and to withdraw a large amount of the Red Army from the Far East. The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun's editorial, while expressing extreme regret at the evolution of the situation, believes that there are many ways to resolve the dispute, and said that Japan has decided to abide by the policy of not escalating the dispute. This is an obvious fact. If the current incident is taken as a turning point and the determination to maintain peace on the border is strengthened, then a friendly solution will not be difficult to achieve. According to general observation, the attitude of the newspapers is quite cautious, and it seems that none of them want the border situation to deteriorate. (July 1st Central News Agency dispatch)

### Japan Production Party Advocates Severing Diplomatic Relations with Russia

[Tokyo] The Japan Production Party today submitted a letter to Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Hirota, Army Minister Sugiyama, and Navy Minister Yonai, demanding the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and calling on the country to engage in diplomacy based on justice. At the same time, it is heard that the Japanese-Manchukuo governments now have the determination to guarantee freedom of navigation on the Heilongjiang River, especially paying attention to the area around the mouth of the river, and regarding this as the boundary between Manchukuo and the Soviet Union. According to a dispatch from the Nichi-Nichi Shimbun’s Qiqihar correspondent, yesterday a part of the Soviet army on Gan’anzigui Island and Qinanhuo Island in the Heilongjiang River began to withdraw to Konstantinovsky and Novopetrovsk. However, the Soviet Union is currently concentrating a large army in these two places. However, this news has not been confirmed by official reports. News from Changchun this afternoon stated that at around 3:00 PM yesterday, three Soviet military aircraft appeared in the sky over Gan’anzigui Island, apparently flying from Hailanpao. After reconnaissance for half an hour, they flew back to Soviet territory. Although the Heilongjiang dispute is becoming increasingly tense, as a result of the negotiations between Ambassador Shigemitsu to Moscow and the Soviet government, the Japanese government still hopes that this case can be resolved peacefully soon.

### U.S. Congressman Praises China's Construction Achievements

Success of the Restoration Project Can Be Predicted; U.S.-China Trade Should Be Improved

[Washington] Democratic Congressman Brown met with Chinese Finance Minister H.H. Kung today and said that he was deeply impressed by the reports he heard about China's progress, especially regarding transportation and national unification. Kung's delegation is capable, eager to innovate, and China has strong confidence. The restoration project will definitely be successful. If China has a definite plan, the United States is prepared to lend money. In general, China's future is very bright. Republican Congressman Walcott told the Associated Press that China's new currency system combined with gold, and its currency linked to the U.S. dollar and British pound, is a very good strategy. However, the U.S. government's handling of China's currency relationship is clumsy, causing the Chinese currency to be closer to the British pound. China needs funds, and the United States is willing to take this opportunity to improve this relationship. The United States is the world's bank with sufficient gold reserves and is willing to lend to China so that Chinese leaders can realize their ambitions. U.S.-China trade relations should also be improved. China has a large population and trade must be prosperous. Secretary of State Hull once said that to sell, one must also buy, and is willing to make concessions to China to promote reciprocal trade. He hopes that all parties in China will work together to support unification. (July 1st Kuomintang News Agency dispatch)

The geography of China and the United States are quite similar, so its railway problems are not the same as those of the United States. The problems China has today, the United States has already solved. Pierson also praised the success of the Guangzhou-Pingxiang railway connection and the convenience of the Hankou-Chengdu air route.

### French Finance Minister Replies to British and American Telegrams Maintaining Currency Cooperation

Seeking to Achieve the Goal of Fiscal Recovery; Gold Reserves of the Banque de France Decrease

[Paris] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon and U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently sent telegrams to French Finance Minister Bonnet respectively. The content of the telegrams was completely the same, roughly stating, "I am deeply gratified that our two countries' finance ministries are continuing close cooperation within the framework of the Anglo-American-French monetary agreement." Bonnet immediately replied with telegrams respectively, roughly stating, "My country's government attaches great value to the close cooperation between our two countries' finance ministries. My country has now decided to strive hard to achieve the goal of fiscal recovery. The result of our struggle will surely enable us to continue the policies in the Tripartite Declaration (issued when the tripartite monetary agreement was established) to achieve success and to end the various difficulties we are currently encountering. (July 1st Central News Agency Havas dispatch)

[Paris] According to the Banque de France's weekly business report released today (as of June 24), the paper money reserve ratio has decreased from 54.92 percent to 52.80 percent. There are two important changes in the report: ㊀ The amount of gold reserves decreased from 57,359,000,000 francs to 54,859,000,000 francs; ㊁ The amount of loans from the Banque de France to the government increased from 7,800,000,000 francs to 9,200,000,000 francs. This shows that the Exchange Equalization Fund, in order to support the exchange rate of the franc, requested the Banque de France to sell 2,500,000,000 francs of gold in the week from June 17 to 24, and that the Treasury, in order to meet expenses, also borrowed an additional 1,400,000,000 francs from the Banque de France during the same period. Generally speaking, the amount of gold reserves in the report to be released next week will continue to decrease, while the amount of government loans will continue to increase.

### Italy and Germany Issue Statement Rejecting Western Sea Patrols and Propose Alternative to the London Adjustment Committee

Propose an Alternative Plan to the London Adjustment Committee; Insist on Maintaining Land-Based Surveillance; Demand that Britain and France Recognize the Belligerent Status of the Spanish Factions

[London] This morning, during a meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish War at the British Foreign Office, the Italian Ambassador, Count Grandi, and the German Ambassador, General Ribbentrop, issued a joint statement rejecting the patrol system on the Spanish seas, claiming that the system had completely failed and there was no need to implement it in the future. However, the statement still approved of the principle of non-intervention and proposed the following suggestions: (1) Allow both sides fighting in Spain to enjoy the rights of belligerents, as neutral countries have other obligations to belligerents according to international law. This decision can consolidate the entire policy of non-intervention; (2) Continue to implement the current surveillance system on the Spanish land borders and ports, with inspectors carried on ships of non-intervening countries. The statement concluded by welcoming all countries to continue to offer other suggestions based on this approach. According to reports, this morning's meeting was specifically to listen to the opinions of the German and Italian governments on ways to fill the gaps in the surveillance system formed after the withdrawal of German and Italian warships, as proposed by Britain and France. The meeting began at 11:00 AM and was adjourned at 1:45 PM, then continued until 4:30 PM.

According to reliable sources, at this morning's meeting, the Italian and German proposals were in opposition to the British and French plans, resulting in a deadlock. The afternoon meeting was only engaged in drafting a communiqué describing the current situation. The new situation will be submitted to the full committee for further consideration. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

[London] It is reported that regarding the surveillance measures on the Spanish seas, the German and Italian governments submitted a note to the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee this morning, rejecting the proposal of Britain and France to replace Germany and Italy in undertaking surveillance on the eastern seas. They also put forward a counter-proposal, advocating: (1) the abolition of the sea surveillance plan, while maintaining the land surveillance plan; (2) recognition of both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerent entities. At the same time, they declared that Germany and Italy were still willing to maintain a policy of non-intervention. Regarding this, British officials have stated that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have fundamentally disagreed with this proposal, and the subcommittee may not approve it when it meets today. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 2nd)

[London] After Germany and Italy rejected the new surveillance plan proposed by Britain and France and put forward a counter-proposal, representatives of the various countries of the Adjustment Committee have agreed to consult their respective governments for solutions. British officials believe that the entire counter-proposal of Germany and Italy, especially regarding the recognition of both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerent entities, will ultimately be rejected. The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee is now scheduled to conduct a comprehensive discussion this afternoon. The Adjustment Committee will probably hold a plenary session at the beginning of next week in order to make a definite decision. However, it can be asserted that the German and Italian counter-proposal will be rejected as a result of the meeting. As for the new plan proposed by Britain and France, it will also be submitted to the Adjustment Committee for a vote. There is particular fear that it will not be unanimously passed, and as a result, the non-intervention system will inevitably collapse, which is to be expected. This is because Britain and France believe that previous resolutions adopted by the Adjustment Committee were made unanimously. If the British and French plan cannot be unanimously passed now, then the policy of non-intervention can be said to have already failed. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 2nd)

### Contents of the Note from Germany and Italy

[London] Regarding the new surveillance plan for the Spanish seas proposed by Britain and France, Germany and Italy have submitted a note of rejection, stating: "According to the agreement between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, both sides of the Spanish Civil War should have been treated equally. This new plan only benefits one side, and the main reason why Germany and Italy oppose it is that. We hereby put forward a counter-proposal, advocating the recognition of both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerent entities. This move does not weaken the effectiveness of the policy of non-intervention, but rather enhances it. Once belligerent status is recognized, European countries, in addition to the obligations they bear as signatories to the non-intervention agreement, should also abide by the obligations of neutral countries based on various international principles, thereby providing double protection. In addition to this, there are various advantages as follows: (1) After both sides of the Spanish Civil War enjoy equal status internationally, they should be fully responsible to all neutral countries for their methods of naval, land, and air warfare; (2) The sea surveillance plan previously implemented by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy has completely failed, and there is no need to adopt other sea surveillance plans in the future; (3) The original sea surveillance plan contained major flaws. In the future, various ships, whether flying the Spanish flag or the flags of countries outside Europe, should be effectively monitored by both sides of the Spanish Civil War themselves, and the original flaws can be easily remedied. However, in addition to the current sea surveillance plan, which has proven to be a complete failure and cannot be continued, the current surveillance system, which has been approved by the Adjustment Committee, should still be maintained. The German and Italian governments therefore propose the following measures: (1) The Spanish land border surveillance plan should be maintained; (2) The current monitoring system in the ports belonging to both sides of the Spanish Civil War should be maintained; (3) Ships belonging to countries that signed the non-intervention agreement should be monitored by inspectors on board. If the countries concerned can offer other suggestions based on this outline, Germany and Italy will welcome them." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 2nd)

### France Resolves to Uphold the Policy of Non-Intervention

To Deal with the Situation in Spain, Take Consistent Action with Britain

[Paris] Foreign Minister Delbos made a speech in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies today, stating France's position on the Spanish issue. This was the first foreign policy speech made by the Foreign Minister since the formation of the new cabinet. The most essential words were: "France now has a strong determination to do its utmost to protect the two principles of non-intervention and the implementation of surveillance in the Spanish Civil War, and will take completely consistent action with Britain." In addition, Delbos reported on the events of the past few days, and said that the Non-Intervention Committee will continue to meet in London tomorrow. The British and French representatives have each received firm instructions from their governments to do their best to defend the policy of non-intervention. At that time, regarding the issue of surveillance on the Spanish seas after the withdrawal of Germany and Italy from naval surveillance, if the representatives of the majority of countries attending the Adjustment Committee can support the proposals of the British and French governments, then Britain and France will consider themselves legally responsible for undertaking all surveillance work on the Spanish seas. However, if Germany and Italy refuse to accept the plans of Britain and France and are stubbornly uncooperative, then Britain and France should reconsider the entire issue. Furthermore, if the international surveillance system is no longer implemented on the border between Spain and Portugal (according to the Portuguese government's notification to Britain, the Portuguese government has decided not to provide any further assistance to British personnel carrying out surveillance work on the border between Spain and Portugal), then France itself will also not be able to accept the implementation of international surveillance in the Pyrenees Mountains on the border between France and Spain. After Delbos finished speaking, the entire Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, regardless of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the various right-wing parties, expressed their support. Before Foreign Minister Delbos gave his speech, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies unanimously decided that France must not recognize the Spanish National Army authorities as a belligerent entity, which is the same attitude taken by Britain.

### Draft Election Regulations for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Distributed

[Moscow] The draft election regulations for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have been published and will be discussed at the fourth regular meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union on the 7th of this month. The draft is based on the relevant provisions of the Soviet Constitution, stipulating that all Soviet citizens who are 18 years of age or older, except for those who are insane or have been deprived of their civil rights by a court, enjoy equal, direct, and universal suffrage and secret ballot rights. The list of electors should be compiled by the local Soviets. When citizens raise objections to errors in the list, the People's Court should make the final decision.

The division of electoral regions for the Soviet of the Union should be based on the principle of one region for every 300,000 people, with each region electing one representative to the Soviet of the Union.

The electoral regions for the Soviet of Nationalities should be divided according to the following principles: each federal republic should be divided into 25 regions, each autonomous republic into 11 regions, each autonomous province into 5 regions, and each national region into 1 region, with each region electing one representative to the Soviet of Nationalities.

The electoral regions for the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities should be further divided into electoral districts. Each military unit should constitute a separate electoral district. In order to monitor the legal conduct of elections, each central election committee should be organized jointly by the trade unions and the representatives of the workers' soviets, with the approval of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The organization of the election committees for each federal and autonomous republic, autonomous province, and national region should also follow the same principles.

Each Communist Party branch, each trade union cooperative, each youth organization, each cultural association, and all registered organizations should be guaranteed the right to nominate candidates. Each central government agency, each trade union, each labor association, and its local agencies, as well as the congresses of workers and employees in each factory, the congresses of soldiers of the Red Army, and the congresses of farmers in each collective farm, also have the right to nominate candidates. Every organization that has nominated candidates, as well as every Soviet citizen, has the full right to campaign for the election of that candidate in congresses, in newspapers, or by other means, without hindrance.

The election of the Supreme Soviet should be held universally on the same day throughout the Soviet Union. In addition, the draft also stipulates several measures to ensure completely secret ballots. The result of the election should be that the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes is elected as a representative, that is, the number of votes he/she obtains should account for more than half of the valid votes in any designated region. If none of the candidates obtains an absolute majority, the two candidates with the most votes should be nominated for a second round of voting.

When the number of voters in an electoral region is less than half of the number of eligible voters, the Central Election Committee should order a re-election in that region.

Anyone who obstructs any male or female citizen from exercising their right to elect or be elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet by means of illegal, deceptive, threatening, or bribery means should be sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years. Any Soviet official or member of the election committee who forges election documents or deliberately miscalculates votes should be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years. (TASS dispatch from the 2nd)

### By-Election Results in the British House of Commons Announced

Liberal and Conservative Parties Each Win a Seat

[London] Former House of Commons members Runciman (National Liberal Party) and Penny (Conservative Party) were both ennobled, and according to the regulations, they cannot be commoner members again, so their constituencies must elect other members to fill their vacancies. The results of the by-elections have now been announced. The seat left by Runciman was filled by Birch of the National Liberal Party, who received 1,344 votes, 210 votes more than Ford of the Liberal Party, who competed for the seat. The seat left by Penny was still won by Lloyd of the Conservative Party, who received 19,887 votes, while Lohman of the Labour Party, who competed against him, received only 9,972 votes. Therefore, the results of these two by-elections are still beneficial to the government. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

### German Evangelical Church Leader Niemöller Arrested

[Berlin] Dr. Niemöller, the leader of the Confessing Church movement in the German Evangelical Church, was suddenly arrested today and sent to Moabit Prison for detention. Niemöller is a prominent figure among anti-government pastors and had previously been repeatedly interrogated by the police authorities. However, in the past few weeks, pastors in the Protestant Church have been arrested one after another, while Niemöller has been able to remain at large until now. In addition, the German government's management of religious affairs is the exclusive responsibility of the Church Affairs Department. Niemöller attacked the head of the department, Kerrl, saying, "After the politicization of the church, it has lost its freedom to be faithful to the Bible and to confess." He also said that the Protestant Church in Germany has now been transformed into a state church and has become a tool of the political authorities. Niemöller also published a list of arrested believers in March of this year and asked the congregation to pray for them. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

### Li Wuyuan, Who Defected in Mitukou, Is Being Monitored by a Certain Party

People's Army Tang Zhuoqun Will Attack Chonglihan; Traitor Tang Seven Points Indulges in Slaughter

A correspondent in Zhangbei reports that Bao Zichen's unit of the 7th Division of the puppet Mongolian army in Chabei, previously under pressure from the People's Army to approach Chongli, followed the order of a certain special affairs agency director and ordered its 11th regiment to travel from Zhangbei to Chongli County (Xiwancun) to reinforce the defense. Now, because the various People's Armies have been announcing attacks to capture the city, but rarely actually follow through, and even if they do launch an attack, they soon retreat, it seems that they have seen through the People's Army's intentions, believing that it is nothing more than a guerrilla harassment maneuver. Therefore, the alert has been relaxed slightly. The other day, the entire 11th regiment was transferred back from Chongli County to Zhangbei and stationed outside the east and west gates. Currently, there are no puppet troops stationed in Chongli County, except for the police and security teams of the puppet public office.

Li Wuyuan, the deputy commander of the 4th Buddha's Unit of the puppet Mongolian 6th Division, stationed in the Mantouying Baihetan area of Gonghui, previously sent his confidant Zhang Zidong to Xihechuan in secret to contact the People's Army, willing to lead his troops to defect and act as an internal response for the People's Army. Unfortunately, the matter was leaked and heard by the director of a certain special affairs agency, who immediately placed Li Wuyuan under house arrest.

On the People's Army side, various units have recently been actively reorganizing their subordinates and carrying out liaison to launch an attack at an opportune moment. The situation in various places is as follows: (1) Tang Chaoqun's unit of the People's Army is currently gathering about 1,200 armed people near Hebao. Recently, because the puppet troops in Chongli withdrew their defenses, they plan to lead their troops to attack Chongli first. (2) Zhang Zhongying's Zhang Youhua unit in the Second District of Xinghe currently has more than 700 men with complete guns and horses and is actively reorganizing in preparation for supporting the various People's Armies. (3) More than a thousand cavalrymen from Zhang Zhongying's unit are currently in the Xiaoshuiquan area and are preparing to recover Xiangyi (i.e., Daqinggou). (4) Chen Bingjun has now recruited more than 900 volunteers and sent them to Li Ying's command to supplement his strength. Li Ying plans to lead his troops to Dolun in the near future.

Since Chabei became a region relied on by rebels, ordinary traitors who willingly flatter foreigners and are crazy have hoped for money from a certain party and have spared no effort to act as accomplices and brutally kill their compatriots. Among them is Tang Yusan, who was originally a famous bandit in Rehe, with a fierce nature. He was a bandit for many years within the borders of Rehe, killing countless people, and therefore has the nickname "Tang Seven Points." Later, he was appreciated by a certain special affairs agency director in Zhangbei and appointed as a member of the special affairs agency's search team. In the past, he once entered the interior to operate and was arrested and imprisoned. Later, because a certain party insisted on this person, he was released. After Tang Seven Points escaped danger, he has been active in the Nanhaogian and Zhangbei areas. During this People's Army uprising, the number of people he openly arrested and secretly assassinated is unknown. Therefore, he has gained even more trust from a certain party. Currently, Tang's actions are even more brutal. Almost no one who is jealous or disliked by him is spared.

### Japanese Seventeen-Year Plan to Build a Puppet Fengtian Metropolis

When Completed, the Population Will Reach More Than 1.5 Million; It Will Be Used as the General Hub for Ruling the Entire Northeast

A correspondent in Shenyang reports that the Japanese are using Shenyang as a base and as a general hub for ruling the entire Northeast in the future. Therefore, they are planning the development of its puppet Fengtian metropolis and have divided it into eleven administrative districts according to the current population situation and geographical area within the puppet Fengtian city. Based on their so-called current urban leap situation, it is estimated that seventeen years after the completion of the urban plan, the population of the puppet Fengtian metropolis will reach more than 1.5 million. When the time comes, the development of various constructions and Japanese enterprises can be expected greatly. If calculated according to the current population growth rate, such as at the end of last year, the population including villages in the nine districts was 616,4309 people. By the middle of June of this year, it had reached 693,770 people. Based on this, it can increase sixfold from Showa 12 (this year) to 18, then increase fivefold from Showa 19 to 23, and increase fourfold from 24 to 28 when the puppet urban plan ends. By the end of that year, the total population is estimated to reach 1,551,045 people. According to the planned eleven districts, the population accommodated in each district will be between 100,000 and 120,000 or 130,000 people. The area and current population of each district are recorded as follows:

First District (Shenyang District): Area 16.830.000 square li, current population 241,960 people. Second District (Yamato District): Area 19.290.000 square li, population 275,370 people. Third District (Tiexi District): Area 17.985.000 square li, population 13,000 people. Fourth District (Dadong District): Area 22.110.000 square li, population 112,200 people. Fifth District (Shenhe District): Area 24.700.000 square li, population 21,680 people. Sixth District (Yongxin District): Area 28.440.000 square li, population 8,530 people. Seventh District (Yuhong District): Area 32.795.000 square li, population 8,150 people. Eighth District (Huanggu District): Area 18.010.000 square li, population 70,820 people. Ninth District (Beixin District): Area 26.290.000 square li, population 23,290 people. Tenth District (Shenhai District): Area 26.305.000 square li, population 16,860 people. Eleventh District (Dongling District): Area 32.245.000 square li, population 3,090 people.

### Japanese Are Using Traitor Merchants to Buy Large Quantities of Wheat in Shandong

30,000 Bags Have Been Purchased Since the New Wheat Harvest; Flour Mills Are Appealing to the Provincial Government for Relief

A correspondent in Jinan reports that wheat prices in Shandong Province have not fallen since this spring. After the new wheat harvest, prices have risen even higher. The Jinan Grain Industry Association increases prices by one or two jiao every evening. It is estimated that since the new wheat harvest, only a little over a month ago, prices have risen by more than one yuan per hundred jin compared to before. The reasons for the price increase include poor harvests in northern and southern Shandong and insufficient inventory in Jinan. Most importantly, the purchase by Japanese merchants has had the greatest impact. The Japanese South Manchurian Flour Mill, which is preparing to revive, is actually supported by Mitsui & Co., Ltd. The machinery has not yet been installed, and the start of work will be delayed by three or four months. However, it is currently buying large quantities of wheat, sending out more than 20 traitors to Taian, Yanzhou, Xuzhou, and other places. It has also entrusted traitor grain merchants to buy from the Jinan Grain Industry Association. It is said that in less than a month, 30,000 bags have been purchased, worth about 400,000 yuan. Regardless of the quality of the wheat purchased, whether it is of high or low quality, sandy or watery, it does not matter, as long as it can be bought. The price is also not deeply negotiated, and its intention to manipulate is clear. There are a total of seven flour mills in Jinan, which are greatly affected. If they offer high prices, they can buy wheat, but the value of flour is restricted by the government and cannot be increased. If they do not offer high prices to buy wheat, they will have no raw materials and will only be shut down. The day before yesterday, the flour mills held a meeting, where each flour mill reported on the condition of wheat sources in various places. In summary, in previous years, Jinan suburbs could collect 10,000 bags per day. This year, due to the poor harvest, and because the villagers see that wheat prices are getting higher and higher and are unwilling to sell, they can only collect 1,000 bags per day. In previous years, Bengbu could collect 10,000 bags per day. This year, due to the disruption of Japanese merchants sending traitors, they can only collect more than 100 bags per day. Wheat prices in Jining have now reached 7.6 yuan. In this situation, Jinan flour must be sold for 4.8 yuan per bag to avoid losses, but the government restricts increases, and the flour mills have no wheat in stock. Only Huifeng Factory has about 10,000 bags of wheat in stock because it stopped the machine for eight days to repair the engine. The remaining six flour mills have only enough stock to grind for four or five days, and the situation is really embarrassing. At that time, it was decided that the flour mills would not buy wheat from the Grain Industry Association within seven days, waiting for wheat prices to fall. However, after two or three days, the flour mills did not buy, which gave the traitors an opportunity. On the 29th, it was reported that 5,000 bags had been purchased in one day. On the 30th, representatives of the flour mills visited Chairman Han, stating their difficulties and requesting that the people's food be given priority and that relief be provided as soon as possible. Han did not see them due to other matters. It is said that the representatives of the factories will petition again in the coming days. (1st)

### Sudden Intensification of Banditry in Henan Province

Large Bands of Bandits Cause Even Greater Harm; Each Band Often Musters Over a Hundred People

Zhengzhou Correspondence: This year's severe drought in Henan Province has left the starving people with no means of survival, leading many to take risks. Although the spring famine period was safely passed, after the start of summer, with the rise of green crops, coupled with hailstorms and locust plagues following one after another, the atmosphere of banditry has reignited in the villages after the disasters, leaving the people uneasy. In the past half month, reports of banditry have been frequent, causing constant disturbances, especially in western and southern Henan. In areas such as Yichuan, Yiyang, Songxian, Yuxian, Weichuan, Xuchang, Biyang, and Queshan, scattered bandits appear from time to time, robbing people clean and causing alarm in the marketplaces. Scattered Red Bandits in special districts and Xinyang County are also rising and falling, displaying considerable tenacity. Among them, large bands of bandits are causing even greater harm. In Xinsai Village, the third district of Zhongmu County, in early June, over a hundred bandits crossed the Yellow River and seized the firearms from the village head's office. They then kidnapped over a hundred hostages, released them, and returned to loot the village a second time before escaping at their leisure. The county government only reported the incident to the Zhengzhou Special Office a week after it occurred, via a report from the responsible district. The Special Office telegraphed the pacification headquarters, requesting that troops from General Zeng Wanzhong's unit be dispatched to suppress them, but the bandits had already fled without a trace. Subsequent investigations revealed that the bandit leader, named Fan Lao San, controls six villages on the border between Kaifeng and Zhongmu, including Fantan, Sunzhuang, Laoyazhang, Guhejie, Dingzhuang, and Zhangzhuang. Each village can readily muster over a hundred bandits. The authorities have ordered the two county governments to strictly reorganize the baojia system to eliminate them. Furthermore, on June 21st, over a hundred bandits were discovered in Shazhuang, Fotun Township, the third district of Lintong. After several days of encirclement and suppression by General Sun's troops, the bandits were subdued, with 26 bandits killed and over ten, including Ding Fuchen, captured alive, brought back to Longzhen, and beheaded for public display. On June 18th, a large band of bandits with significant momentum was discovered in Tongshangou, Biyang. The local security team is currently engaged in suppression. Recently, over two hundred bandits from Tongbai County crossed into Magutian near Tongshangou, fully equipped with firearms, and are now entrenched in the Wangzhuang area, committing adultery, arson, and all kinds of atrocities, causing the residents to flee.

She suffered head and leg lacerations and bleeding. Fortunately, the chief of the Zhengyi police station witnessed the incident, and the driver, Ruan Afa, realizing he had caused an accident, stopped the car. Bayer and others lifted Xia onto the car and drove to Zhengyang Bridge, where they hired a car to take her to the county hospital for treatment. Her injuries are severe, and her life is in danger. Bayer and the driver, Ruan Afa, were sent to the county for investigation.

### Suzhou

Silk Cocoon Firm Illegally Bribes Officials

Shen Chang Silk Cocoon Firm in Dongting Xishan Township, established by Qi Zhongfang and managed by Xu Haoran, was reported to the county government for illegal cocoon collection in violation of regulations. After County Magistrate Deng personally investigated, he ordered the firm to be shut down and the over 150 dan of dried cocoons already collected to be sealed. However, Zhou Hao, the deputy director of the Sericulture Improvement Zone, secretly compromised with the firm and sent County Magistrate Deng a check for 600 yuan, euphemistically calling it a "public welfare fee." County Magistrate Deng considered this to be bribery and reported it to the provincial authorities. The Construction Department ordered the 600 yuan to be used as a fine for the firm, and Deputy Director Zhou received a major demerit. However, due to the complexity of the case, a decision has been made to send personnel to Suzhou to thoroughly investigate and prosecute the matter.

Since the dredging of Huangtiangang in this county two years ago, due to the large scale of the project, in addition to the provincial government's subsidies, 50,000 yuan of Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Construction Bonds and land surtax reserved for road construction in the county were used to borrow 92,070 yuan in national currency from the Wuxi China Bank and various local farmers' banks and money shops, with a three-year repayment term. Over 66,000 yuan has already been repaid. Now, with the abundant harvest of the 26th fiscal year, the remaining 25,400 yuan will be fully repaid next spring.

Yangtze River Water Level Rising Sharply

The Yangtze River water level has been rising sharply recently. Since the major flood of 1931, the second-highest water level was in 1935, and the lowest was last year. On June 27, 1935, the water level in Hankou was 39 feet 2 inches. This year, the water level in Hankou during the same period has reached 40 feet 05 inches. Last year, the same period was 33 feet 9 inches. This year's water level is more than one foot higher than in 1935 and six feet six inches higher than last year. The Jiangsu provincial authorities, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, have already begun flood prevention measures in the Jiangnan area a month ago. Starting on the 1st, the entire province has uniformly begun flood prevention efforts.

### Yangzhou

Extension of Land Tax Collection Deadline

The deadline for the collection of the first and second installments of land tax for the 25th fiscal year in this county has been extended until the end of June this year. According to regulations, late payment penalties should be added after the deadline. However, County Magistrate Ma, considering that many landowners are busy with farming and unable to make payments before the deadline, which is different from those intentionally delaying payment, specifically requested the Department of Finance to extend the deadline for one month until July 1, 1937. Late payment penalties will be collected from August 1 at a rate of 20%. The request has been approved by the Department of Finance for a one-month extension.

Booming Wheat Market in Tongtai

This year's wheat harvest in Tongtai and other areas in Jiangbei is quite good. Currently, wheat flour merchants from Jiangnan are flocking to various wheat-producing towns and cities, setting up shops to purchase goods. The financial market has seen a sudden revitalization. The Shanghai-Yangzhou liner ships have been running special trips to transport wheat in recent days.

### Haizhou

Grain Prices Gradually Soaring

Since the new grain came onto the market in Dafenshan Town, Guanyun County, grain prices are even higher than for old grain. Foreign merchants are gathering and competing to buy. Recently, there have also been Zhuang buyers purchasing in Yishou, causing grain prices to soar. Red wheat is 2.4 yuan per peck, jade wheat is 2.6 yuan per peck, soybean is 1.8 yuan per peck, and barley is 1.5 yuan per peck. The prices of all kinds of grain are rising daily, with demand exceeding supply, causing considerable panic among the population.

### Jiashan

Butchers Protest Tax Increase

The slaughter tax in Jiashan County began in 1934. At that time, due to insufficient educational funding, a tax of 1.2 cents was added per pig. In 1935, an additional 2.4 cents were added, and by last year, it had reached 4 cents, the same as the regular tax. The slaughter tax rate in the Jiashan area has also exceeded the standard. The county government recently stated that the total tax revenue for the 25th fiscal year was 9,200 yuan, a shortfall of over 1,600 yuan. They summoned butchers from across the county to revise the tax rate. However, the butchers held a meeting and firmly opposed the increase. They sent representatives to petition the party and government, but without results. Starting today, the county government will implement the tax collection using a stamping method.

### Taizhou

Strictly Prohibit the Export of Draft Cattle

Recently, cattle dealers have gathered in various townships and cities in Wenling, selling draft cattle for export in large numbers, causing prices to soar. Uninformed farmers, tempted by temporary profits, have sold off their cattle. According to recent investigations, over a thousand heads have been sold off in less than a month. The county government, recognizing this, has reportedly ordered strict secret investigations and prohibitions to prevent the impact on next year's farming.

Rice Insects Rampant in Wenling

In the southern districts of Wenling, including Zhuheng, Xijintou, and Youqian, continuous rainfall for nearly a month has caused rice crops to be infested with insects, which are rampant. The affected rice crops are withering. The early rice harvest will be greatly affected. Those responsible for pest control have been petitioned to take measures to prevent the spread.

### Yuyao

Opening a Model Salt Field

Since the West Zhejiang Salt Affairs Administration planned to merge various small salt fields into five large salt fields, progress has been made. Recently, in order to improve all facilities and make management easier, it was decided to open a model salt field in Yao, expand salt fields, increase production, improve the manufacturing method to ensure hygiene, build roads to facilitate transportation, and set up lookout posts to facilitate law enforcement. The project is expected to be completed in a year.

### Over Ten Thousand Female Workers at Fourteen Silk Factories in the Xinza District Go on Strike

Request for Wage Increase Not Approved by Factory Owners; Labor Union Makes Every Effort to Prevent the Spread of the Labor Unrest

Dagongshe reports: The female workers of fourteen silk factories, including Fuchang in the Xinza District of this city, collectively declared a joint strike yesterday at 1:00 PM to demand a wage increase. Negotiations between labor and management have not yielded results, so work is unlikely to resume this morning. The 6th District Sericulture Union is making every effort to mediate, to prevent the escalation of the labor unrest. Details are as follows:

Sudden Strike

Yesterday, after the lunch break at the silk factories in the Xinza District, just as everyone was about to enter the factory to work, over sixty female workers at the Fuchang Silk Factory on Changan Road suddenly refused to enter the factory, demanding a wage increase. When the factory owners ignored them, the factory's one thousand-plus female workers collectively responded, launching a joint strike. Fearing trouble, the factory owners immediately stopped the machinery. After striking, the workers went to nearby factories, calling on the workers to join the strike. By 1:30 PM, thirteen silk factories in the Xinza District, including Jiufeng, Yuangu, Jincheng, Qiaxing, Dafeng, Shunfeng, Yongru, Taihui, Haifeng, Weiyuan, Tongyu, Jiyu, and Jiuyu, had also joined the strike. Currently, a total of fourteen silk factories in the Xinza District have completely stopped production and joined the strike, involving approximately ten thousand workers.

Failed Negotiations

After the workers of all silk factories in the Xinza District went on strike, the 6th District Sericulture Union immediately dispatched personnel to mediate, but without success. At 3:00 PM, union directors Yuan Yunlong and Yang Gengji went to the Silk Factory Association to meet with the chairman, Shen Huachen, to negotiate a solution. However, the results were negative. The workers demanded an increase from the current wage of 45 cents per day to 55 cents, but the factory owners were only willing to increase it by two cents to 47 cents. After the union representatives reported the outcome to all the workers and urged them to resume work, the workers expressed dissatisfaction, resulting in no resolution. A Dagongshe reporter interviewed the striking workers yesterday. According to them, the wages of silk factory workers in Shanghai were 60 cents per day in 1929, 55 cents per day in 1930 and 1931, and after 1931, due to the depression in the silk industry, they were reduced to 50 cents per day, and later to 40 cents. Last year, with the recovery of the silk industry, wages were increased to 45 cents per day, but with the recent rise in prices and the increased cost of living, it is difficult to maintain a livelihood with the original wages, so they demanded an increase to 55 cents per day. The motive is pure and there is no intention to be disruptive.

Preventing Escalation

To prevent the escalation of the labor unrest, the 6th District Sericulture Union decided to dispatch all directors and supervisors this morning to urge a return to work, and hopes that the factory owners will resume production as usual, so that the dispute can be resolved as soon as possible. As for the silk factories in the Zhabei and Hongkou Districts, the situation was very stable yesterday. The union is making every effort to prevent the unrest from spreading. At the same time, after receiving reports yesterday afternoon, party and government agencies and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions will send personnel this morning to investigate the truth and implement mediation to resolve the situation as soon as possible.

Hee Kee Dispute

Also, after the sudden closure of the Hee Kee Silk Factory in Hongkou and the resulting dispute, around 9:00 AM yesterday, five or six hundred female workers went to the factory on Tiantong Road, demanding a resumption of work, causing great disorder. The nearby Linping Road police station dispatched police to maintain order. The workers then elected representatives to report to the 4th District Sericulture Union. The union's executive director, Chen Xiupu, rushed to the factory and convened a meeting with the workers. Meanwhile, executive director Yang Hongmei met with the workers' representatives to solicit opinions. The workers stated, "We demand a resumption of work to maintain our livelihood. If the factory owners move the raw materials to the Tianchang Silk Factory, then we must also go to work at Tianchang. Otherwise, we demand severance pay." The union convened an emergency meeting at 12:00 PM to discuss solutions and instructed the representatives to inform all workers to return home and await a resolution.

### Song Ziwen Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon

Results Exceptionally Satisfactory

Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, went to Guangdong on the 15th of last month to reorganize the Guangdong currency and inspect Qiongya. He then traveled to Guangxi to discuss the reorganization of the financial problems in Guangxi Province. On the 1st, he visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at Feilu to report on his southern trip. Yesterday morning (the 2nd), after finishing his duties, he, along with his secretaries Chen Kangqi, Jiang Weixian, and Zhang Fuchen, took a Boeing plane from Xun and left at eleven o'clock, returning to Shanghai, arriving there at one thirty-five in the afternoon. Those who came to welcome them at Longhua Airport included Shanghai Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Municipal Police Chief Cai Jingjun, Deputy Commander of the Security Force Wen Huazhou, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China Bei Songsun, Secretary-General Dai Zhizqian, Mrs. Song Zhang Leyi, Song's son Zi Liang, and Guo Dehua and Wang Zhinan, and others. After getting off the plane, Song returned to his private residence on Qiqi Road to rest. The results of Song's trip to the south were exceptionally satisfactory, and although he traveled in the dust for more than half a month, his spirit remained exceptionally vibrant.

### Yu Ming to Head Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Chen Ming Appointed as Deputy Director; Zhou Jue and Zhao Tiezhang Transferred to the Ministry

Zhou Jue, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Zhao Tiezhang, the deputy director, have been transferred to serve in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Yu Ming and Chen Ming have been appointed to fill the vacancies. According to Zhou and Zhao, they will complete the handover as soon as they receive orders and then proceed to Nanjing.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd: According to diplomatic sources, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently announced that Yu Ming, counselor of the Ministry and concurrently director of the Shanghai Office, and Chen Ming, first secretary, have been transferred to the Ministry. Chen Ming will serve as deputy director. Yu has served as the director of the Ministry's office for many years, and this appointment is intended to utilize his familiarity with the position. Chen has also served in the diplomatic field for many years and is especially familiar with the situation in Japan. Zhou Jue, the concurrent director, will return to his original position as secretary of the Ministry. Zhao Tiezhang, the deputy director, will be transferred to serve as the chief of the General Affairs Section of the Ministry.

### Four Hundred Soviet Merchants Pay Income Tax

China Christian Council Also Agrees

Since the Income Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in this city started levying income tax on foreigners from countries without consular jurisdiction, foreign residents have been enthusiastically paying taxes recently. It is reported that at 3:00 PM yesterday, four hundred Soviet merchants notified the bureau that they would pay their profit income tax since January 1 of this year on a scheduled date in the coming days. It is also learned that Xu Wusheng, an official from the bureau, previously discussed the collection of salary income tax from members of the China Christian Council with Zhu Lide. Some progress has been made. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency visited Zhu yesterday to inquire about his opinion. According to Zhu, he strongly supports this matter. Since we are Chinese citizens, we should abide by the fair laws promulgated by the government. The national associations under the jurisdiction of our association will urge their members to obey. However, the difficulty lies in that it is easier to collect taxes on fixed salaries, but how to pay taxes on indefinite public funds is a matter that we should consider.

### Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council Negotiate Tobacco Control in Concessions

Tobacco Licenses Issued by the Municipal Government; The Shanghai Municipal Council Drafts Detailed Rules; Implementation Pending Approval by the Shanghai Municipal Council

The issue of tobacco licenses for tobacco users in the Public Concession has recently been planned by Chinese government agencies, and a general framework has been fully decided. However, there are various external rumors that do not match the facts. According to the investigation by a Shenshi News Agency reporter, the details are as follows: Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally assumed the post of Director-General of the National Anti-Opium Bureau, anti-opium agencies across the country have been working together, and the opium poison has been largely eliminated. According to an American survey, China has banned more than 50% of opium cultivation. Therefore, the government's anti-opium campaign is indeed showing maximum determination, hoping to completely eliminate opium poison nationwide by 1940. However, in the Shanghai Public Concession, people still rely on the Concession as a shield and have failed to effectively implement the government's anti-opium measures. Therefore, Wang Tianmin, the director of the National Anti-Opium Committee, and Yu Fengshao, the deputy director, came to Shanghai from Hankou to discuss and plan anti-opium measures in the Concession with Du Yuesheng of the Shanghai Anti-Opium Committee, Chen Lingyun, the special envoy of the Songhu Garrison Command, Yu Hongjun, the acting mayor of Shanghai, and Fessenden, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Stirling Fessenden, the director-general, and others. After repeated consultations, Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun proposed the following five anti-opium principles to the Shanghai Municipal Council: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Government entrusts the Shanghai Municipal Council to handle the issuance of tobacco licenses and anti-smuggling matters in the Public Concession. (2) The Shanghai Municipal Council will establish an anti-opium office, and the Shanghai Municipal Council will have full authority to handle affairs, except for those recommended by the Municipal Government. (3) All anti-opium licenses will be issued by the Municipal Government, but the Shanghai Municipal Council will collect the applications for tobacco licenses from tobacco users and forward the licenses. (4) The required office and anti-smuggling expenses will be paid from the license fees. If there is a shortfall, the Municipal Government will subsidize it. (5) Captured opium offenders will be sent to the Westerners' Prison on Huade Road in Hongkou for detention (but the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that the Westerners' prison on Huade Road is often overcrowded, so it has decided to send offenders to Chinese prisons for execution). Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council has appointed Fessenden, Chairman Stirling Fessenden, British Chief Inspector Stirling Fessenden, and Boland, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Legal Department, to be responsible for drafting the detailed rules for the implementation of anti-opium and anti-smuggling measures. Once the draft implementation rules are drafted, they will be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council for approval, and then they can be implemented. (Note: The Shanghai Municipal Council meets every two weeks, the last meeting was on June 30, and this meeting is scheduled for July 14).

### Zhang Qun to Go to Lushan in the Coming Days

Zhang Qun, the Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday (the 1st) and is scheduled to go to Lushan in the coming days to preside over the Lushan talks. It is learned that the list of those invited to participate in the Lushan talks was personally decided by Chairman Wang Jingwei and President Chiang Kai-shek. The invited leaders from all walks of life are invited in their individual capacities, not on behalf of the organizations to which they belong. Furthermore, the invitees are limited to their residence, so the number of people cannot be too large.

### Xu Shiying Scheduled to Return to Shanghai This Morning

The report that Ambassador Xu Shiying, who is stationed in Japan, went to Nanjing on the evening of the 30th to meet with Foreign Minister Wang, reporting on his meeting with the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe Shigeru, and that Xu had already returned to Shanghai by train yesterday morning is inaccurate. According to a message from Xu's residence last night, they received a long-distance call from Xu stating that he would be taking the Sanbei Company's Longxing Steamer from Beijing back to Shanghai this morning, arriving the day after tomorrow.

### Sales Representatives of the China National Tea Corporation to Travel Abroad

The China National Tea Corporation, at its recent third joint board of directors and supervisors meeting, decided to select and dispatch specialist Yu Zhiyong to London, England, and Morocco, Africa, to investigate the latest market conditions of international black and green teas.

It is also reported that the corporation plans to send British technical consultant Mr. E. P. Wisham to Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian and other provinces' tea improvement farms and other tea-producing areas for investigation and observation. He is expected to depart around the 10th, with the aim of contributing to the improvement of Chinese tea production methods.

### Cattle and Sheep Industry Yesterday Petitions Various Parties

Opposing Additional Transit Taxes by the French Concession

The Cattle and Sheep Industry Association of this city, due to the increase in cattle and sheep transit tax by the French Concession, has repeatedly opposed it without success. The association, again yesterday, sent five executive committee members, including Shen Chenxuan, Gu Ligang, Yang Zhaosheng, Pu Shunan, and Wu Bangjie, to submit petitions separately to the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and also submitted a request for assistance to the Municipal Police Bureau. The Municipal Government was received by Huang Yunshu, a staff member of the Second Section; the Bureau of Social Affairs was received by Sheng Yudu, a staff member of the Second Section; and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was received by Secretary Yan E'sheng. All promised to do their best to assist and forward the matter for consideration. The document submitted to the Municipal Government is recorded below:

Regarding the dispatch of representatives to respectfully submit a petition, earnestly requesting the relief of suffering. Your association members have heard that the Finance Bureau under your government intends to levy a slaughter tax on cattle, which is unbearable. We request that a reasoned petition be submitted to terminate the proposed plan. In this city, due to inconsistent police powers and the existence of special districts, the burden on merchants and the people cannot be fair, which has long been understood. The cattle and sheep industry is particularly distressed. The Second Special District levies a transit tax on cattle and sheep (which the association is still opposing), and the First Special District has imposed various restrictions on the industry, increasing the burden. It is estimated that the cost for each head of cattle includes 60 cents for pre-slaughter inspection by the Municipal Health Bureau, 50 cents for each of the two transit taxes by the Second Special District, 1.5 yuan for inspection fees at the First Special District slaughterhouse, and 2 yuan for vegetable cattle inspection fees in Jiangsu Province, totaling at least 5.1 yuan. The heavy burden is evident. Moreover, this industry is composed of small-scale businesses, and the capital for trading is entirely borrowed, with heavy interest. This is the reality of the suffering, which should be relieved.

Furthermore, according to Article 4 of the Regulations for the Implementation of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System (promulgated on March 25, 1937), "The original tooth tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes of an operational nature in various places should be changed to business tax. The tooth post tax, pawnshop tax, slaughterhouse license tax, and other licenses of an operational nature should be converted into business license tax." It is not known whether this regulation has already been implemented; merchants have limited knowledge. However, since this announcement has been made, implementation is expected, and business tax is a local tax that has been implemented in various places for a long time. This city has not yet implemented it due to obstacles, which is to your government's credit, and merchants are greatly benefited. However, considering the situation of this industry, rather than being burdened layer upon layer, exceeding the ability to bear and leading to unsustainability, we still wish to switch to business tax. Moreover, judging from the smooth implementation of income tax, the implementation of business tax seems to be without problems. As for the difficulties in your government's budget, merchants are aware of it and should enthusiastically contribute. However, it seems unfair to impose a particularly heavy burden on this industry alone. Therefore, all the reasons for the industry's earnest request for relief of suffering and conversion to business tax are combined and representatives are sent to respectfully submit a petition to your government. We humbly request that the proposal to levy a slaughter tax on cattle be terminated, as it is in the public interest.

### Japanese Oppression of Our Student in Japan, Ye Wenjin, Returns to Petition

Requesting the Government to Negotiate Based on Reason; Hosting a Press Conference with the News Media

The New Voice News Agency reports that our students in Japan have been repeatedly oppressed by the Japanese Metropolitan Police Department on fabricated pretexts, with large-scale arrests, detentions, interrogations, and insults. In recent years, no fewer than four or five batches have been expelled back to China. Now, all students in Japan are in danger. Various student, hometown, and cultural organizations have specially dispatched representative Mr. Ye Wenjin to return to China to request the government to negotiate reasonably to stop this, and to appeal for assistance from compatriots in the country. Mr. Ye, holding a joint letter from these organizations to our Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, arrived in Shanghai on the 29th of last month. On the afternoon of the 5th, at 3:00 PM, he will host a reception for newspaper reporters at the Guanshengyuan restaurant on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession to report in detail. According to Mr. Ye, speaking to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday, our students in Japan are constantly monitored by the Japanese. Anyone with patriotic thoughts and actions is charged with so-called anti-Japanese "anti-Manchu" crimes, illegally arrested and detained, and subjected to private torture, using a specially made rubber club to severely beat their heads. Because this type of rubber club does not injure the exterior but seriously injures the brain nerves, the intentions of the Japanese towards these students, who are intellectuals, can be seen. Moreover, many of our Northeast compatriots are studying in Japan. The Japanese forcibly make them recognize themselves as so-called "Manchukuo" nationals and forbid them from interacting with our compatriots. All of this awaits our government's forceful negotiation and the support of compatriots throughout the country.

In order to facilitate summer tourists traveling to Qingdao to escape the heat, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has specially organized the launch of Shanghai-Qingdao liners, with the Hai Yuan, Hai Li, and Hai Zhen vessels, in addition to their usual Shanghai-Guangdong line service, operating regularly on the Shanghai-Qingdao line.

Three Vessels in Operation

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company organizes summer Shanghai-Qingdao liners every year to facilitate people from all walks of life to travel to Qingdao to escape the heat. Now that summer has arrived, many people are sure to travel to Qingdao to escape the heat. The company decided to launch the regular Shanghai-Qingdao liners on the 9th of this month, as in previous years. In the future, the Shan Hai Yuan, Hai Li, and Hai Zhen vessels will operate on a rotating basis. Each vessel will stay in Shanghai for six days after arriving from Guangdong and then sail to Qingdao. After returning to Shanghai from Qingdao, they will continue on the Shanghai-Guangdong route, regularly sailing to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places. It is also learned that Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie had previously telegraphed the company repeatedly, requesting the long-term maintenance of the Shanghai-Qingdao route. However, the company was unable to comply due to insufficient vessel allocation. But now, due to practical needs, although it will be after the end of the summer this year, the company may add shipping capacity to make this line a regular liner route year-round.

Schedule and Fares

The Shanghai-Qingdao line will begin on the 9th of this month with the Hai Yuan vessel departing from Shanghai to Qingdao. This will be followed by the Hai Yuan vessel on the 16th, and the Hai Li vessel on the 22nd. Thereafter, the three vessels will operate on a rotating basis. Fares for the grand dining room are 40 yuan, first class 20 yuan, second class 12 yuan, third class 6 yuan, and fourth class 4 yuan.

The Real Estate Association of this city received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating, "We are writing to inform you that we received a letter from the Tianjin Real Estate Association stating that the income tax has been implemented, and the scope is limited to income from profit-making businesses, salary income, and income from securities deposits. The income from land and housing has not yet been listed. Members of this association requested an explanation, and we replied that the Financial Department of Income Tax Affairs has already provided an explanation on this issue: Income from real estate is considered as a first-class profit-making business if it is for profit-making purposes. According to this explanation, those who rent out real estate must pay income tax unless it is for profit-making purposes. However, the Land Law has been implemented separately, and this industry bears a heavy burden, with overlapping taxes. Your city implemented income tax earlier. How is the income from the real estate industry taxed? Are there any differences? Please provide detailed information." According to reporters from the New News Agency, the association believes that rental income collected by rental agents does not need to be taxed, while companies that rent out real estate should pay the first category of income tax. However, this matter is very important, and it is planned to convene a meeting in the coming days to study it in detail before making a decision.

### Exchange Supervisors Today Thoroughly Investigate the Manipulation of the Flour and Wheat Market

The Bureau of Social Affairs' Price Restriction Measures Will Be Implemented Upon Approval; Cotton Exchange Handling Deliveries Starting with Auctions in June

The various exchanges are handling the half-year settlement, and after the holidays, they will reopen today. The exchange supervisors are thoroughly investigating whether there is any manipulation of the flour and wheat market. Director Yan of the Ministry of Industry is staying in Shanghai to further investigate those who manipulated the cotton cloth market in May and June. The details are as follows:

Cotton Exchange Handling Cotton Deliveries

After the Minister of Industry, Wu Dingchang, personally agreed to extend the date for cotton deliveries, the Cotton Exchange will handle cotton deliveries today, and tomorrow is a regular weekly holiday. The cotton deliveries will be handled the day after tomorrow, and the seven, eight, nine, and ten-month cotton flowers will be auctioned as usual starting on June 6th. The pre-paid deposit will be canceled. As for those who manipulated the market during the May and June turmoil, the Ministry of Industry has ordered the Exchange Board of Directors to truthfully expose them within a week and sent the Director of the General Affairs Department, Yan Shenyu, to stay in Shanghai to continue the investigation in order to hold them accountable.

Flour and Grains to Be Auctioned Today

1. The Shanghai Flour Exchange was closed for the past two days to handle the half-year settlement, and it was originally scheduled to reopen as usual today. According to reporters from the New Voice News Agency, the exchange has not yet recovered the overdue funds, so it is difficult to predict whether it will be able to reopen this morning. 2. The Shanghai Grains Exchange was closed for the past two days to handle the half-year settlement and decided to reopen as usual today. The brokers of the two exchanges have each held meetings and decided to refuse commissions for speculative buying and selling by outsiders.

Thorough Investigation of the Manipulation of the Flour and Wheat Market

Exchange Supervisors Wang Xiaolai and Yu Kai Zhan believe that the soaring prices of the flour and grains exchange markets are unexpected at the time of the new wheat market. Therefore, in addition to summoning the directors of the two exchanges, Gu Xinyi and Jin Runxiang, for inquiries, they will send personnel starting today to suspend and review the account books of each flour broker to thoroughly investigate whether there is any manipulation. The Bureau of Social Affairs will implement the restriction of market prices in the two exchanges after the approval of the Ministry order.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Other Three Groups Held a Public Banquet for the Sichuan Delegation and Others Yesterday

Lin Ziming Hopes that National Product Manufacturers Unite and Sell Overseas

The National Chamber of Commerce Federation, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Local Association held a public banquet yesterday noon at the sixth floor of the Pudong Fellow Association on Chengdu Road for the Sichuan Commercial Delegation, and Lin Ziming, the representative of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce who came to China to solicit national products. During the banquet, Lin Kanghou reported on the meaning of the banquet. The situation is recorded separately below.

Guest List

The attendees included Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation Lin Kanghou, Huang Renzhi of the Local Association, as well as Wang Zhisheng, Jin Runxiang, Gu Huai shui, Wang Boyuan, Cao Zhigong, Hu Xiyuan, Wang Xingke, Feng Xunchen, Miao Zhongxiu, Deputy Leaders of the Sichuan Commercial Delegation Li Kuian Yang Runzhi, Lin Ziming, and more than seventy people.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Lin Kanghou stood up and delivered a speech, saying that today is a public banquet held by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other public groups for the Sichuan Commercial Delegation, and Mr. Lin Ziming, the representative of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce who came to China to solicit national products. It is an honor to have everyone present. At present, China's politics and commerce are gradually on track. Our colleagues in the business community should all stand up, unite, and learn from each other. We must know that the development of industry and commerce is closely related to the country, the nation, and society. Last year, we had an organization of the Nanyang Commercial Delegation, and we went to various places in Nanyang to conduct investigations separately, and we gained a lot. Now the Sichuan business community has come to Shanghai for inspection and is very hardworking, which we admire. But I hope that in the future, we can continue this grand event, come to Shanghai for inspection in an endless stream, and provide frequent guidance. Next, Huang Renzhi delivered a speech, the words are omitted.

Guest's Reply

After the chairman finished speaking, Li Kuian, the head of the Sichuan Commercial Delegation, delivered a reply of thanks, saying, "It is with great humility that we are holding a public banquet by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other three groups. The purpose of this trip to Shanghai is to collect industrial and commercial materials, but the meaning is very profound. Moreover, Mr. Lin and Mr. Wang are leaders in the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles and bear a major responsibility for the industrial and commercial circles. Shanghai once had the organization of the Nanyang Delegation, led by Mr. Lin, which shows the Shanghai industrial and commercial colleagues' emphasis on the foreign market. As for Sichuan's past industry and commerce, it was very young. Now, it is not only that industry and commerce are gradually recovering, but the general public has a deep impression of national products. But I hope that the Shanghai financial community and the industrial community will provide more guidance and development." Then, Lin Ziming replied, "The feelings of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang for their motherland are gradually getting closer. Recently, there have been inspections of the country and tours of the country, which has made the domestic situation clearer. Overseas Chinese in Nanyang love their motherland and use national products, but it is not easy to find national products. Therefore, the authorities of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and leaders from all walks of life hosted the first National Product Display and Sales Conference in 1935, which was enthusiastically participated by manufacturers and achieved satisfactory results. In 1936, we continued to hold the second exhibition and sales conference. This year, we will continue to hold the third exhibition and sales conference, and we hope to get your enthusiastic participation and active participation. Just in Singapore, among the population of more than 600,000, overseas Chinese account for more than 500,000. In the entire Malaya population of more than 4 million, the total number of overseas Chinese accounts for more than 2 million. In the future, the development of our national products in the overseas market will be unlimited. I hope that the domestic agencies, groups, and manufacturers will unite to form a powerful organization to sell our national products overseas. " It is heard that the Sichuan Commercial Delegation is scheduled to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo express train to Hangzhou today to continue its inspection, staying for a few days. On the 6th, they will come to Shanghai again to participate in the 10th Anniversary Celebration of the Municipal Government. Yesterday, they also went to the Jianghai Customs to petition for the abolition of the valuation tax on bristles.

### Implicated in Yarn Exchange Scandal, First Special Court to Investigate Two Public Officials This Morning

Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi Both Summoned

Since the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange experienced a manipulation and speculation scandal, Wu Dingyuan, director of the Ministry of Industry, the governing authority, and Supervisory Committee Member Yan Zhuang have thoroughly investigated it. In addition to administrative penalties imposed on relevant brokers in accordance with the Exchange Law, it was also found that Wu Qiding, director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Sheng Shengyi, director of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau, were heavily involved in the scandal. Because Wu and Sheng were public officials who still engaged in manipulation and speculation, strict investigation was deemed necessary to rectify officialdom. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry transferred the violations of Wu and Sheng to the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court for investigation. It is reported that the prosecutor's office of the First Special Court has appointed Prosecutor Song Genshan to handle the investigation. Mr. Song has scheduled a hearing at the Civil Law Court 14 at 9:00 AM this Saturday, i.e., today. Summonses for the defendants Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi, as well as witnesses Mu Ouchu, chairman of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, Fei Dai, and Yang, have been sent separately. However, it is still uncertain whether today's investigation will be public.

Nanjing, 3rd telegram: The case of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been transferred to the First Special District Court in Shanghai for investigation. The court has scheduled the hearing for the morning of the 3rd. The summonses for Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi arrived in Nanjing around 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. The Ministry of Finance has dispatched tax police to escort Wu and Sheng to Shanghai on the evening of the 2nd.

### Yang Qingchang's Wife Appealed, Dance Girl Sentenced

Convicted of Enticement, Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment

Yang Qingchang, son of the late former Zhejiang Governor Yang Shande, a native of Anhui, was reported by his wife, Zheng Fengying, to the French Concession police for having adulterous relations with Tang Xiangying, a Vienna dance girl. Yang and Tang were detained and brought to the Second Special Court for prosecution, where they were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment, commutable to a fine of two yuan per day. After Yang Qingchang regained his freedom, he still did not return home. Yang's wife sent her servant, Li Amao, to investigate, and he found Yang still at Tang Xiangying's residence. Zheng Fengying believed that Tang intentionally enticed her husband, refusing to let him leave the family and return home. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the criminal court of the Second Special Court, accusing Tang Xiangying of disrupting the family, requesting a legal investigation, and attaching a civil suit seeking one million yuan in compensation for damage to reputation and emotional distress. The initial trial resulted in Tang Xiangying being found not guilty, and the attached civil suit was dismissed. Zheng Fengying, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After the trial concluded, the court scheduled a date to announce the verdict, as reported in this newspaper. Now, the Third Branch of the High Court announced the verdict yesterday, sentencing Tang Xiangying to six months of imprisonment for enticing a married person to leave the family, commutable to a fine of three yuan per day, and transferring the attached civil suit to the civil court for trial. Neither the appellant nor the appellee was present when the verdict was announced. It is said that Tang Xiangying's side stated that since Yang Qingchang was released after his initial arrest, they had not met at all, let alone cohabited. Hearing of the High Court's verdict, they believed that the appellant had not presented substantial evidence to the court, and the sentence of imprisonment was based solely on the one-sided testimony of Li Amao. She vowed not to accept it and, upon receiving the judgment, decided to appeal to the Supreme Court to seek redress.

### Extortion Attempt Failed, Followed by Arson

Subsequently, police officers discovered that the case was actually committed by Shen's clan nephew, Shen Xinhai, and his accomplices. They pretended to negotiate near the Miaohao Road in South Shanghai at 10:00 PM the other night and arrested Shen, who confessed to conspiring with his accomplice, Zhang Ke, to write threatening letters to his clan uncle. The remaining accomplices are currently being pursued and brought to justice for interrogation.

He wrote "Wang Linsen," 20 years old, from Zhejiang province, on the registration book. He then went out and returned with a prostitute at around 10:00 PM in the evening to sleep together. Unexpectedly, he had a sudden desire to end his life, secretly swallowed opium smoke, and committed suicide. At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the hotel's tea boy, Zhang A'er, heard the guest sighing outside the room. Knowing something was wrong, he went inside to check and suddenly saw the guest's face turn pale and he was unresponsive. The prostitute sleeping next to him was still fast asleep. He woke her up, and she also did not know what had happened to the guest. He immediately reported to the management, who reported to the Xinzha Police Station and summoned an ambulance to the scene, which rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital. However, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6:30 AM this morning.

Falling from Sunning Platform

Zheng Wen's daughter, Gendi, from Liuhe, Jiangsu, five years old, was playing on the sunning platform at No. 534 Da Tong Road at around 4:00 PM on the afternoon of June 30th, when she accidentally fell to the ground.

However, he died before reaching the hospital due to his severe injuries.

Stabbed with Knife

Wang Haizong, 27 years old, a Ningbo native residing in the garret at No. 477 Qipu Road, had been suffering from severe mental illness recently. At 8:15 AM on June 28th, his illness worsened, and he stabbed himself in the head and throat several times with a kitchen knife, causing him to collapse to the ground, bleeding profusely. His father, Wang Rongsheng, witnessed the incident and reported it to the Huisi Police Station, who dispatched an ambulance to the scene and rushed him to Tongren Hospital. However, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 4:30 AM yesterday morning. The above four bodies were all sent to the Fei Lun Road autopsy center by the respective police stations. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang, appointed by the First Special District Court, visited the center and confirmed the identities of the bodies and ordered the respective family members to sign and claim the bodies separately.

### Central Trust Bureau Adds Life and Credit Insurance

The Insurance Department of the Central Trust Bureau has been offering various insurance services, and the types are becoming increasingly complete. To promote social welfare and solve the problem of employee guarantees in various industries, it has added life insurance and credit insurance. Details obtained are as follows:

Life Insurance

The life insurance offered by the Insurance Department of the bureau has many categories and offers extremely favorable terms for the insured, with convenient options. It is broadly divided into group life insurance, individual life insurance, annuities, and personal accident insurance. Group life insurance is divided into three types: ㊀ one-year term, ㊁ age 60 endowment, and ㊂ whole life. Individual life insurance is divided into six types: ㊀ savings, ㊁ whole life, ㊂ term, ㊃ joint, ㊄ gift, and ㊅ business. Annuities and personal accident insurance can be designed and underwritten at any time according to individual needs.

Credit Insurance

The newly added credit insurance has a wide scope, covering losses from fraud, embezzlement, dereliction of duty, theft, and other types of misconduct. It is a good method to improve the current guarantee system. Credit insurance is divided into ㊀ individual credit insurance, ㊁ group credit insurance, ㊂ unregistered credit insurance, and ㊃ contract credit insurance. The insurance premium rates are very low, and the procedures are relatively simple. According to reporters, the above two insurance products have been carefully planned and prepared for a long time. However, during the preparation period, a large amount of business has already been accepted, especially from government agencies and organizations. In addition, the original loss insurance products have also made significant progress. The bureau's original location was insufficient for the development of various departments, so the insurance department has been relocated to No. 6 The Bund to operate. Branch offices in various locations are attached to the local central bank and also handle various types of insurance.

### Two Japanese Traffickers Arrested

Arrested in Liu Fen Lane in the City

Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Old North Gate Police Station received a tip from an informant that two Japanese nationals were selling narcotics such as morphine and heroin at No. 45 Liu Fen Lane, Wu Mu Di, in the city. Police Chief Shen immediately dispatched Inspector Du Maoyong and Police Officer Zhang Wenda, and requested police brigade members Lv Guofan, etc., to rush to the scene. They arrested two Japanese nationals and confiscated 140 packs of morphine and 120 small packs of heroin on the spot and took them to the station for investigation. According to the interrogation by Police Chief Shen, the Japanese nationals identified themselves as Nakamura Yoshio, 28 years old, residing at No. 35 Changan Road, Wusong Road, and Takahashi Kiyoshi, 23 years old, residing at No. 75 on the same road, and admitted to selling heroin. Because the case involved the cracking of foreigners sneaking into the interior to sell drugs, it was immediately prepared as a document to be submitted to the General Bureau for review.

### Wang Xinggao Has Gone to Gansu Court to Summon Bail Bondsmen

Only Five Out of Seven Shops Appeared, Deadline for Paying 20,000 Yuan Bail Bond in Three Days

Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing, an abettor in the previous case of the assassination of Tang Jiapeng at the Great World Amusement Park, was exposed by the captured criminal Zhao Guangfu. The French Concession police arrested Wang and brought him to the Second Special Court. After questioning, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. Wang was not satisfied and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. As a result, the original verdict was revoked, and he was acquitted. During the appeal period, he was required to provide a 20,000 yuan bail bond with the promise of appearing when summoned. Because the police department of the French Concession was not satisfied, it requested the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has revoked the second-instance verdict of the Third Branch of the High Court declaring Wang Xinggao innocent and remanded the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. Judge Chen Daqi once held an investigative hearing. Wang Xinggao failed to appear, so the Third Branch of the High Court summoned the owners or managers of Wang's bail bondsmen, seven shops, including Huang Shijie, a few days ago, instructing them to hand over Wang Xinggao to the court by 9:00 AM on July 2nd. Failure to do so would be inconvenient. Yesterday was the deadline. The bail bondsmen were summoned again at 9:00 AM, and Judge Wang Yue interrogated them in the Third Court. Only Huang Shijie (owner of Hongda Rice Shop), Jin Changqing (manager of Xin Xing Bathhouse), Chen Guojun (owner of Yong'an Rice Store), Lin Zihe, manager of Dachengxiang Foreign Goods Store, and Wang Yisheng, the younger brother of the owner of the Meidong Company, the current manager, appeared with lawyers. The judge asked if Wang Xinggao had appeared today. Huang Shijie and others replied, based on what Wang's family had said, that Wang Xinggao had gone to Gansu in the Northwest for some business and would return in about two or three weeks. The judge said, "In that case, Wang Xinggao has clearly fled. You bail bondsmen have a great responsibility. You are given three days to pay the 20,000 yuan bail bond to this court." Wang Yisheng stated that Wang Xinggao was guaranteed by the Meidong Store. The Meidong Store was previously opened by Li Meidong, who sold the store to my brother Wang Yiting for business in May of this year, changing the name to Meidong Company. Now my brother and Li Meidong have gone to the three northeastern provinces, and I am temporarily acting as the manager of the store. We are not aware of the matter of guaranteeing Wang Xinggao. Lin Zihe stated that I am the manager of Dachengxiang. Zhang Shuzhou, the accountant, handled the guarantee for Wang Xinggao. Zhang has now left his job due to embezzlement, but the store owner, Zhang Maode, knows about the guarantee for Wang Xinggao. The guaranteed amount is 12,000 yuan. After verifying the statements in court, Judge Wang Yue ordered Wang Yisheng and Jin Changqing to post bail and set a deadline of three days to pay the bail bond to the court for further verification.

### Dinghai Fishing Boat Sunk by Foreign Vessel

Four Fishermen in Distress, Chen Bangyou and Others, Seek Relief from Dinghai Fellow Townsmen Association Yesterday

Yesterday, at the Dinghai Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, four shipwrecked crew members from Dinghai County, Chen Bangyou, Qian Yunxi, Jiang Juxing, and Lin A'bao, requested assistance to return home. According to them, the four were all fishermen who co-owned a three-masted fishing boat. On June 21st, they sailed from Dinghai to the sea to fish. It was the rainy season, so they caught a lot. When they sailed to the sea area of Daji Mountain outside Wusongkou, a heavy storm struck. The boat tried its best to hold on, but it was suddenly hit broadside by another new-style fishing vessel. The boat immediately sank, and the entire crew fell into the water. Fortunately, the seabed there was not deep, and after the boat sank, the top of the mast was still above the water. The crew members in the water clung to the top of the mast and shouted for help to the vessel that hit them. The vessel, seeing that it had caused an accident, immediately turned around and fled. The name of the vessel is unknown, but a flag of a certain country was attached to the vessel. At that time, the captain, Xin Yuanfa, was exhausted and was swept away by a huge wave, and his body has not been found. When the four were in danger, a customs pilot vessel happened to pass by. Hearing the four shouting for help, the vessel rescued them and they were able to survive. However, the loss of the boat and fish is over 5,000 yuan. The sunken boat's captain was 46 years old and still has an elderly mother at home.

### British Tobacco Merchant White Arrives in Shanghai to Investigate Business

The British London Players Tobacco Company, one of the world's largest tobacco factories, produces Craven cigarettes, which are sold all over the world. The company has branch factories in India, Australia, and Canada. The main factory is located in northern London and was established in 1788. The founder, Mr. Players, was not only a shrewd and capable businessman but also a philanthropist. He donated a total of 2 million pounds during his lifetime. Before his death, he donated another 2 million pounds. The company's factory building is magnificent, costing 1 million pounds to build. The internal equipment is the latest style, with a total area of 6.5 million cubic feet. There are more than 80 cigarette-making machines, all manufactured by the company itself. Each machine can produce more than 1,000 cigarettes per minute, but the company limits the output to 500 cigarettes to ensure quality. A total of more than 3,000 workers are employed, with an average salary of more than 200 yuan in Chinese currency. With complete facilities and the implementation of worker welfare programs, all workers live and work in peace and concentrate on their work. All manufacturing work is done by machines, without touching human hands. The Craven cigarettes produced are made from a blend of more than 100 kinds of the best tobacco leaves, so the taste is consistently the same. The air in the factory is constantly changed and adjusted, with no dust or debris mixed in. The cigarettes produced are mellow and do not hurt the throat, unlike cigarettes sold on the market. The latest packaging machines are used to maintain the fresh taste of the cigarettes when they leave the factory. Recently, Mr. White, a grandson of the founder of the company, came to Shanghai to investigate business conditions. Lu Meiseng, manager of the United Advertising Company, hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel to entertain him. Those present included Guo Chengen of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Cai Zhaopin and Lin Jingu of Wah Fei Tobacco Company, Wang Zhongwei of Xinwen Bao, Zhao Shuyong of Shen Bao, Zheng Xitao of Shishi Xinbao, Zhu Yitian of Dalu Bao, and Yu Huidong of United Advertising Company. During the banquet, Mr. White spoke in detail about the company's situation. The Craven cigarettes are high-quality, mellow, meet scientific and hygienic conditions, and are beautifully decorated, so they are widely sold in China. Mr. White is young and handsome, intelligent and capable, and has studied cigarette packaging methods. He will be able to continue his grandfather's legacy and offer excellent products to people in all countries around the world.

### Lack of Ships in the Far East

Insufficient Ships Even in the Philippines

According to shipping industry sources, empty ships are very scarce in Chinese coastal ports, and chartering is extremely difficult. The lack of ships in the Philippines is even more severe than in Shanghai. A certain employee of the Buloshi Wood Manufacturing Company recently went to the Philippines to purchase timber for shipment to Shanghai. He said that although timber can still be purchased, it is impossible to charter a ship for transportation, even at high prices. In this city, a time charter ship named Huada, with a net weight of 4,000 tons, was chartered the other day for a period of six months at a monthly rent of 29,000 yuan and is scheduled to be delivered in August or September. Xinhua Shipping has also chartered its ships at a rental price of 4.6 yuan per ton, transporting crushed coal from Tanggu to Shanghai once. The rental price of the Huangshigong ship is 11 yuan per ton, transporting salt from the Zhoushan Islands to Yuezhou once.

### Labor Strike at Shanghai Brewery Continues to Be Mediated

Since the labor strike occurred at the British-owned Shanghai Brewery, although the situation has appeared to ease with mediation by Wang Xianqing, director of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the General Labor Union, the matter has not been resolved in reality. Although the brewery retracted its announcement of completely dismissing the old workers, it has actually dismissed thirty-six workers, while the rest have resumed work as usual. However, all the workers insist that the brewery reverse its decision to dismiss the thirty-six workers, so mediation is continuing.

### Rampant Mosquitoes in the Public Concession

Over Forty Malaria Cases in May; Health Department Seeks Private Assistance

The Public Concession was originally a mosquito-free zone. However, in recent years, with the development of roads and the frequent travel of automobiles between urban and rural areas, mosquitoes have been able to spread and flourish within the concession area via automobiles. Although the Public Works Department has organized mosquito eradication car teams to carry out extermination efforts, they have not yet achieved the anticipated complete eradication. According to information from the Public Works Department's Health Department, in May, thirty-seven cases of malaria among Chinese residents and twelve cases among foreigners were reported to the department. The eastern district is the area most severely plagued by malaria mosquitoes. Among the thirty-seven Chinese malaria cases reported in May, twenty-six resided in the eastern district. According to the Health Department, mosquito breeding grounds are currently visible everywhere in the eastern and western districts, with malaria mosquito larvae breeding within them. However, such breeding grounds have not yet been discovered in the central and northern districts. Although the work of the malaria prevention teams is currently being carried out actively and they are indeed able to address the known malaria mosquito breeding grounds, the number of mosquito breeding sites on private properties is countless. The department has limited personnel and cannot inspect and clear them all one by one. Heads of households should regularly inspect their homes, ensuring that places within the home that typically breed mosquitoes receive attention, especially often-overlooked blocked drains, empty cans, and other containers. While malaria mosquitoes may not necessarily prefer to inhabit such places, it is known that a type of malaria mosquito found in this city often resides in them when it cannot find better locations.

### Liu Luyin's Subordinates Resort to Robbery in Shanghai After His Arrest

Twenty Arrested by Police, Revolutionary Documents Seized; Four Women Released, Six Transferred to Garrison Headquarters; Remaining Ten Indicted for Robbery by Police

Lu Liankui, Chief Inspector of the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police, and detectives Liu Shaokui, etc., having discovered that a large gang of daring robbers was hiding within the concession with unlawful intentions, led detectives Feng Zhiming, Zhu Shouling, Wang Chengying, and detective Yang Xiguang, etc., to arrest the following at the Daming Hotel at 495 North Xizang Road, room 42 of the Changjiang Hotel at 2, Lane 14, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, and the Xin Sanjiang Hotel on Guangdong Road: 1. Wang A'er, 2. Guo Xiaosanzi, 3. Li Changsheng, 4. Ding Jutang (also known as Changbiao), 5. Wang Jieqi, 6. Yang Dianhua, 7. Yang Shengshi, 8. Ding Gaoshi, 9. Chen Ruzhen, 10. Li Guitang, 11. Li Xilin, 12. Xu Zhimin, 13. Wang Zhiqing, 14. Li Dachengzi, 15. Tao Ruhong, also known as Xiao Kuizi or Xiao Erzi, 16. Zhao Guohua, also known as Baichu, 17. Zhao Xiongshi, 18. Zhou Changlin, 19. Liu Shaohua, and 20. Yuan Zhenqing, a total of twenty people. Three pistols, twenty-one bullets, and a counterfeiting machine for twenty-cent nickel coins were seized. A large batch of revolutionary documents, maps, and surveys of Jiangsu Province's troop deployments were seized from Yang Dianhua's home at 64 and 65 Xicheng Lane, Malong Road. They were handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The police have determined that Yang Dianhua and Ding Jutang are the ringleaders among the twenty defendants. Yang and Ding originally belonged to Liu Luyin's organization, engaging in various activities intended to overthrow the government. Since Liu's arrest in connection with the assassination of Yang Yongtai, the gang's source of funds was cut off, and they resorted to robbery. They had previously robbed the home of Shi Dongshi at 16, Lane 951, Chengdu Road, on March 27th, taking 793 yuan worth of property, and the home of Guo Liangshi at 7, Lane 259, Dongyouheng Road, on April 29th at 8:10 PM, taking 243 yuan worth of property. This time, they planned to gather and rob in Suzhou, but were apprehended by detectives just as they were about to depart. The police have now filed public charges against defendants 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 16 with the Special District Court for crimes including endangering public safety, counterfeiting currency, and robbery, under Articles 187, 199, and 330 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court to interrogate them. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, because the defendants had committed crimes endangering the Republic of China in the interior, sent Xu Pengfei, deputy leader of the investigation team, to the court with a document requesting that the twenty defendants be handed over for questioning. Ru Bao-yi, the police's lawyer, stated that the police did not object to the Garrison Headquarters' request for extradition, but that ten of the defendants had already been indicted by the police, and it would be difficult to approve the extradition before the court made a judgment. He also stated that the four female defendants, Yang Shengshi, Ding Gaoshi, Chen Ruzhen, and Zhao Xiongshi, had been found by the police to have committed no crimes in the concession or the Chinese-controlled areas and should be released according to law. As for the remaining six defendants, Yang Dianhua, Li Xilin, Wang Zhiqing, Zhou Changlin, Liu Shaohua, and Yuan Zhenqing, the police had not indicted them and could hand them over to the Garrison Headquarters along with the evidence. The remaining defendants who had been indicted could also be handed over to the Garrison Headquarters after trial. Judge Feng verified and ruled that Yang Dianhua, Li Xilin, Wang Zhiqing, Zhou Changlin, Liu Shaohua, and Yuan Zhenqing, along with the relevant evidence, should be handed over to the representatives of the Garrison Headquarters for extradition. The four women, Yang Shengshi, etc., were approved for release. The trial of the cases indicted by the police was then conducted, and a new date was set for further questioning.

### Yang Lingfo's Honor in America

The famous calligrapher Ms. Yang Lingfo recently traveled from Southern California to Northern California in the United States and was hosted by the International House of the University of California. She was invited to exhibit her works, and the venue was packed with guests, including dozens of UC professors. Ms. Yang created a five-foot-long piece of calligraphy on the spot, inscribing a quatrain. It was immediately translated into English, and the audience was amazed and applauded continuously. Ms. Yang has now been hired by the University of California authorities to teach Chinese painting in the summer school (starting June 28). Thirty-five university professors from various states in the United States are currently gathered at the University of California to attend the summer school. Ms. Yang is promoting Chinese culture among them, enabling Westerners to have a deeper understanding of Chinese art. Her contribution is significant. It is also reported that Ms. Yang spent five months in Southern California, where she was hosted by the American Women's Peace Society, which provided travel expenses. She exhibited in various counties in Southern California and broadcast translated Chinese poems and discussions on the relationship between art and peace in English on the KeTK radio station every week. The American Women's Peace Society calls Ms. Yang an artist of humanitarianism.

### Haimen Native Association Requests Improved Facilities on Shensha Liners

The Shanghai Haimen Native Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Navigation Bureau yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the liners operating on the Shensha line are poorly equipped and pay little attention to passenger safety and hygiene. For example, steerage passengers are mixed with livestock, the stench is overwhelming, and there are no restrictions, resulting in overcrowding. During this hot summer, passengers often suffer from heatstroke and sunstroke due to the suffocating air. Regarding safety, only cabin and first-class passengers have life jackets; other passengers do not have this equipment. Should an accident occur, the majority of passengers would be helpless and awaiting death. In addition, when the ships arrive at the ports, petty thieves and hooligans, taking advantage of the naiveté of the villagers, sneak in and pickpocket passengers every day. Recently, this has become even more rampant, with goods even being lost. If the cargo owner can pay a small fee, the lost items can be recovered, amounting to extortion. This situation is heartbreaking to describe. We are writing to request that you strictly order the shipping companies on this line to improve the facilities as soon as possible to emphasize hygiene and ensure safety. We also request that you forward this letter to the Municipal Police Bureau, asking them to station police officers at the docks of each ship to patrol closely and prevent theft. We would be most grateful."

At the Meiya Tenth Silk Weaving Factory in Dongbaziqiao, Zhabei, workers from Xin'an County, Zhejiang, and Sheng County had previously worked together.

### The Labor Dispute on the Jardine Matheson Longhe Ship Has Been Resolved

Xu Dingsheng Receives a Three Yuan Raise

The Longhe ship of the British company Jardine Matheson had a vacancy for the second mate the day before yesterday. According to custom, Xu Dingsheng, the worker with the longest service, should have been promoted. However, the company suddenly overturned the custom and replaced him with Hu Baochu, leading to a dispute. At the same time, all the workers on the ship believed that the workers had worked diligently and faithfully for many years, and that the position of mate was their only hope. They expressed their sympathy and support for Xu Dingsheng, gathering hundreds of people to prevent Hu Baochu from taking over. The company, fearing that the incident would escalate, telegraphed the police to send officers to protect them, creating a very serious situation. The Chinese Seamen's Union learned of the incident and sent Yang Hu, a special commissioner, and Wang Jiyi, the secretary of the union, and Wang Yalun, the section chief, to mediate. They first stopped the conflict between the two sides, and then consulted with Mr. Tot, the general manager of the company, to find a solution. As a result, the company believed that Xu Dingsheng did not understand English and that this might interfere with his duties, so the company overturned the established practice, hoping that the workers would understand. At the same time, Xu Dingsheng received a three yuan raise from the company and would not be promoted to mate for the time being. He would be given priority for promotion when there was another opportunity. As for the Longhe mate, Hu Baochu would take over. It was decided that the special commissioner would give a speech to all the Longhe workers at the union's auditorium at 2:00 PM this afternoon. The labor dispute was resolved, and the patrol car and Chinese and foreign detectives stationed by the French police at the Jardine Matheson wharf were withdrawn.

### The Puppet State of Manchukuo's Participation in the World Education Conference: Our Nation Will Definitely Not Attend

Statement by Hu Shi, Head of Our Delegation

(Beiping, 2nd) Hu Shi, head of our country's delegation to the World Education Conference, will go to Lu on the 9th to attend the tea party between Wang and Jiang. Hu stated that if Japan allows the puppet state of Manchukuo to participate in the World Education Conference, we will definitely not attend. In addition to sending a telegram to Japan to inquire, our delegation will also consult with international law expert Zhou Gengsheng to study necessary countermeasures.

Moved earlier and changed to a meeting this afternoon. He continued, saying, "The situation and organizational significance of this association are not very clear to the outside world, and even some members of this association do not understand it very well. Therefore, it is necessary to explain it further today." The establishment process of this association can be divided into four stages: ㊀ Preparatory stage: In May of the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), Professor Ilerus of Beiyang University prepared and initiated it. ㊁ Establishment stage: The first national conference was held in Shanghai in May of the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), and Guo Bingwen was elected as the president at that time. ㊂ Reorganization stage: From the eleventh to the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), the association's affairs were virtually suspended during this period. ㊃ Development stage: From the twenty-first year of the Republic of China (1932) to the present, it is the development stage. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China (1934), the association held its third annual meeting at Beiyang Institute of Technology. Among the important cases was that the association previously only had an English name and English constitution. It was at that annual meeting that the decision was made to have a Chinese name and constitution. Today is the fourth annual meeting of this association. There are ten branches of this association. Those present today are eight branches, including Jiaotong University and Yenching University. The qualifications for membership in this association are stipulated as follows: anyone with one of the following qualifications can be elected as a member, namely ㊀ university students who are about to graduate and have excellent character and academic performance, ㊁ university graduates who have made special achievements in academic research or social undertakings, ㊂ those who have studied in the United States and have been elected as members of honorary societies such as Phi Beta Kappa, ㊃ those who have profound academic achievements or extensive writings in any field. Among these four qualifications, this association particularly emphasizes attracting members with the first and second qualifications. The significance and purpose of organizing this association is to encourage outstanding students who have not yet graduated from various schools to join this association, and to continue to study humbly and continue to learn, which still has educational value. However, some people say that this will inevitably cultivate arrogance and other bad habits in outstanding students. Regarding this point, the association also has a regulation on the oath of new members when they join the association. The oath is: "I promise to abide by the constitution of this association for life, maintain the reputation of this association, strive to study academic subjects, serve the society with loyalty, be humble and self-disciplined, cultivate virtue and encourage learning, so as to increase the glory of this association." Moreover, as evidenced by the past, fortunately, this kind of phenomenon has not occurred. Therefore, the organizational significance of this association is very profound. I hope that all members have a deep understanding of this. When we send new emerging countries with good national fortune, we especially hope that the academic community will make considerable efforts in this regard." Next, Zhong Weicheng spoke on behalf of Principal Li.

Speeches

### Against the "No Buying or Selling of Smuggled Goods Movement"

— Liu Qian

Smuggling should not be simply a problem that threatens China; everyone understands this. Because, in fact, legitimate trade in China, including Japan, is severely affected. In this situation, the "No Buying or Selling of Smuggled Goods Movement," which opposes smuggling, should be a powerful defensive line that all countries hope for. But the reality is far from it: when I say "all" countries, I actually mean "some" countries, in that the Shanghai Public Concession's Municipal Council has a very clear stance on this. According to yesterday's newspaper reports, "The 'No Buying or Selling of Smuggled Goods Movement Committee' of various circles in the city, in order to awaken the people of the country to unanimously promote no buying or selling of smuggled goods, requested the broadcasting industry and cinemas to promote it. Therefore, lantern slides with slogans of no buying or selling of smuggled goods were made and inserted for screening. The Municipal Council, upon hearing the news, sent personnel to various cinemas to prohibit it."

Generally speaking, when a movement is politically obstructed, the main conditions are nothing more than "matters related to local security" or "harming diplomatic relations." How could the slogans of the "No Buying or Selling of Smuggled Goods Movement" on film be related to security? Although Japan is doing its best to condone rampant smuggling, it has not yet reached the point of openly rewarding it. Then, it seems that it would not harm diplomatic relations, would it?

Since it is not for these reasons, what is the Municipal Council's purpose in interfering so arbitrarily? Approving or opposing something is naturally a matter of "right" and "wrong." The Municipal Council believes that the "No Buying or Selling of Smuggled Goods Movement" is "wrong," so it wants to oppose it. Obstructing it because of opposition is naturally "the logical thing to do." But from another perspective, if the "No Buying or Selling of Smuggled Goods Movement" is "wrong," then "buying and selling smuggled goods" is "right." Since the Municipal Council has already arbitrarily interfered with the "wrong" "No Buying or Selling of Smuggled Goods Movement," it will naturally promote and reward the "right" "buying and selling smuggled goods." What kind of world has the Chinese people's Shanghai become?

The essence of the Public Concession's Municipal Council is a complex organization. Although people from various countries participate, it does not necessarily represent the intentions of the governments of those countries. This can be proven from the interference in the "No Buying or Selling of Smuggled Goods Movement." In fact, for countries that have commercial relations with China, there is not a single one that does not "hate smuggling to the core." Although they hate it to the core, they do not stand up to express their support for justice. The reason is very simple: they are afraid of offending people and avoiding trouble. The Municipal Council understands this intention and deals with everything accordingly. Once they have this prejudice, they no longer have "right" and "wrong," nor "justice" and "reason." Therefore, Chinese people in Chinese Shanghai cannot perform patriotic dramas, while "New Earth" films that promote aggression and greatly insult China can still be screened safely even if the film censorship committee does not pass them.

This is actually cowardly! And Chinese people "swallowing insults and bearing humiliation" under this cowardice are no longer worthy of pity!

Why?

The giving of sympathy requires a considerable price. A strong person who does not work but only asks for handouts receives far less sympathy than a person who struggles hard. We must understand whose Shanghai Shanghai actually is. Do not be blindly cowardly, nor blindly hateful. The question is what to do after being hateful?

Grievances and kindness should be distinguished clearly, and the weight of the insults heaped upon us should also be clear. Only revenge is the main road for us to seek survival!

### Burial at Sea

— Jiang Ye

The ship has been sailing in the boundless sea for a full four days. If it doesn't encounter any more wind, it will take at least two more full days to reach Hong Kong. Although it has already traveled two-thirds of the way, the people in the cabin are even more urgently calculating the days and hoping for the ship to dock.

Perhaps those passengers living in the grand staterooms don't calculate the days of the journey, because they still enjoy themselves and are comfortable during the journey. If there are no storms and the ship is traveling on a smooth ocean, they may feel even more comfortable. But the third-class passengers crammed into the steerage cabin suffer more in one day at sea than enduring a day of hardship in hell. Because in the steerage cabin, they not only face those dim lights all day long, without a bit of sunshine or fresh air, but also the unbearable stench of vomit and sea odor mixes everywhere. There is no entertainment, and comfort is out of the question. The passengers living here are all people at the end of their ropes. Everyone is returning from failure, and not one is returning in glory. Here, there are small businessmen who have failed, coolies who have lost their jobs, poor people who are sick, and vagrants who have been exiled. So everyone here has common feelings and a common destiny. Although no one recognized each other when they were abroad, after a few days of gathering, everyone feels that the people here are intimate and close companions. Moreover, they all belong to people returning from failure. This kind of mutual sympathy makes them feel that only the people who gather here at this time are the closest.

The several patients in the dark corners of the cabin are also the ones that the people in the cabin sympathize with the most. When they groan and groan in those corners, the sound is like a sharp knife piercing people's hearts. Everyone is concerned about their condition, everyone is concerned about their lives, and everyone is thinking about themselves and their future destiny because of this.

People who were already seriously ill, after such a few days of hardship at sea, their illness is deepening day by day. Although there is also a doctor on the ship, it has nothing to do with the third-class passengers. So no matter how dangerous the patients in the cabin are, the doctor will not come. Although the ship will reach Hong Kong in two more days, the lives of the patients, like the ship's journey to the shore, are getting closer and closer to the world of death. Everyone is worried, and everyone feels that an unfortunate event is about to happen.

Finally, on this day, one of the patients stopped breathing in the early morning. When this was discovered, the people in the cabin were all in turmoil. Everyone went to watch beside the dead person, everyone was silently contemplating, and then the cabin was everywhere talking about everything about the dead person. According to the report of his companions, the deceased was an old Chinese worker who had been away from his homeland for more than 20 years, and was also a vagrant who had been expelled after losing his job.

After breakfast, two people carrying a plank of wood walked down from the ladder, followed by a tall foreigner, who held a pen in one hand and a small notebook in the other. After he asked the people in the cabin for the name of the deceased, a thin, stiff, and cold corpse was carried onto the plank and walked towards the cabin door. The people in the cabin also followed one by one and walked onto the deck. At this time, everyone on the deck showed a sad and solemn face. Everyone fixed their eyes on the friend on the journey who was about to be buried in the sea after a moment, a fellow countryman who was at the end of his rope and was expelled to return home.

"PonDon!" With a sound, the waves cracked open a huge mouth and swallowed a corpse. Although the ship was still moving forward, the eyes of the people on the deck were still fixed on the receding place, until everything was no longer clear as to where the burial place was, one by one they lowered their heads and walked towards the cabin under the three-layer board, but the sound of "PonDon" just now still seemed to be vibrating in people's ears.

### Letter from the Camp

— Ji Jin

The door was pushed open violently, and a familiar postman stepped into my room and said: This letter has been transferred three times!

It was sent from a military camp in the north, and it was the handwriting of a close friend.

"Three and a half years of austerity gave me a pure-blooded soldier's shell. I have eaten rough rice and breathed in the sand wind."

"Look: my protruding chest, like trying to resist the air pressure of the whole world, is rising and falling. My hands and feet have thick calluses, regarded as records left by climbing countless thorns."

"Let you say this: Min is dead and another one has come alive."

Eagerly imagining the friend's lively posture, I had to close my eyes tightly, and I saw, clearly, two: a young soldier in military uniform, holding a gun tightly; a dying, sick, long-haired young man: standing slyly side by side and glaring at each other.

"Half a month ago, we arrived at Yangcun. At this moment, I am hiding in the dim corner of a grocery store, writing."

"You still remember such a town, when recalling every time we took the train to Beiping. Now, surrounding us is the atmosphere of bandits, we smell it."

"The sky is clear, when this early summer daytime, at lunchtime, there is always the roar of an engine, echoing across the horizon. The sky is light blue, when this early summer daytime, without a single floating cloud, stretches from the long edge of the green grass straight to the eaves, looking out, there may be a few eagles hovering in the distance. At this moment, the enemy's eagles will挟 with the roar of its engine, swoop past the roof, stretching its long wings and hiding in another distant wilderness."

"It is so逼凌 us, threatening us, imagining攫杀 us."

"In the dim light of the barracks, leaning on the straw mat, how can people who have lost their land not foresee a bloody melee and cherish a brave dream?"

"Here, all the garrulousness is reduced to silence!"

"People who have lost their land yearn for the comrades on the steel rails—that gray tank, on the tense contact line, it has a sly, reckless demeanor, and is not an 'absolutely obedient' one, but a fiery, tenacious symbol of the heart."

"A soldier has a brave dream, a beautiful 地 dream着的."

I sympathize with Min's words. They have a brave dream, it is better to say a united and brave war song, while we are only immersed in endless self-biting worries; they, those soldiers, have giant hands that hold the gun tightly, while our hands only grasp the cold void and tremble.

I put down the letter, looked around my small room—a lukewarm prison—containing infinite hatred, towards the hanging portrait of a woman and the painting of a fruit bowl, towards those gray and moldy books. Repeatedly reciting the sentences in the letter, I felt a new vitality in my body was跃动, so slowly and亢昂.
