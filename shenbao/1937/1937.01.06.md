### The Future of the Sino-Japanese Problem (Continued)

— Li Shengwu

First, does Japan harbor a war complex towards our country, and have we, a nation steadfastly adhering to peace, given her a reason to declare war on us? Regarding these two questions, the answer is unbearable. From her repeated actions against our country, we can only see that she despises us, mocks us, and insults us, and we cannot feel that she treats us as a serious enemy. What is manifested in our country is "hatred." Hatred is the inner meaning of hostile forces, but it is itself a sign of cowardice. Once the power hidden within is unleashed, there will be no more hatred, but it will turn into tragic courage and restore correct action.

Second, our country has never declared war on Japan, nor has it ever infringed upon Japan's rights and interests. In terms of reason and logic, she has no need to "wage war to reduce war."

Third, Japan has already seized one-ninth of our country's territory. She is almost doing whatever she wants in North China. If we still think she wants to wage war on China, we must ask, what is her war objective?

Looking back at our country, the degree of tolerance towards Japan "has already exceeded the saturation point." The resolution of the Guangdong-Guangxi problem can predict the spirit of unified resistance to foreign aggression by the responsible authorities; since the Suiyuan conflict, the nation has been running around, calling out, and enthusiastically providing support, which can be used to observe the magnificence of the latent national spirit; the people's disregard for the threat of force, their calmness, and the upward trend of all industries show that the mentality of seeking temporary survival no longer exists. Therefore, at this stage, a word of resistance will be supported by the whole country, and a word of war will see the whole country rise in arms. The emotion of war permeates the whole country, the national plan of war is fully revealed, and the purpose of war is displayed before us. It can be said that all the conditions for war are in place, and what is being considered is the weighing of objective advantages and disadvantages and the issue of the strength of the allied nations.

As long as war has not broken out, diplomatic channels should not be severed. Diplomacy is to reconcile the interests of both sides, so as to avoid armed conflict. It has absolutely nothing to do with personal issues, nor does it have any emotional effects. Maintaining national interests is the only sacred duty of diplomats. The current diplomacy with Japan is not only to resist Japan's unreasonable demands, but also to resolve past outstanding cases. The transition of diplomacy from "defense" to "attack" and the transition of resistance from "defense" to "attack" stand on the same foundation. This foundation is the strengthening of political power and military power. As for how to use this foundation in peaceful diplomatic methods to avoid the disadvantages of favoring one side over the other and to recover lost rights, that is where the transformation of diplomacy with Japan lies.

In dealing with the diplomatic problem with Japan, the application of wisdom and ability should not be limited to the Japanese side alone. The accumulation of rights and interests of European and American countries in China over the decades is almost interconnected, forming a network of common interests. To put it bluntly, the previous open-door and balance-of-power policies were all unavoidable measures taken because of the unequal distribution of rights and interests in China. Isn't the advocacy of "sovereign integrity" placing our country under the joint protection of nine countries? Over the years, the active struggle of the whole country has gradually met the conditions for the survival of a modern nation. However, the disturbances of the Boxer Rebellion in the distant past and the intermittent wars of the past twenty years make it difficult for the great powers to completely cleanse their bad impressions of our country in a short period of time, and the manifestation of this bad impression cannot be felt within the country. Therefore, our country should never think that Japan aims to dominate East Asia, thereby arousing the dissatisfaction of the great powers, and slightly ignore the relations with the European and American powers. Especially when our country's national strength is increasing and gradually entering the stage of actual independence and autonomy, we should pay attention to the relationship between Japan and the great powers while strengthening the connection between our country and the great powers.

In short, from observing the course of the Sino-Japanese problem, it can be said with certainty that Japan's policy towards me aims at gradual aggression, not hesitating to engage in local contention, and trying its best to avoid "war," but demanding the spoils of war. If our country cannot or is unwilling to repay it with "war," then we have to rely on diplomacy—active diplomacy, aggressive diplomacy!

### England and the Fascist Countries (I)

— English Parliamentarian Strabolgi, Translated by Jin Tunan

Between 1911 and 1914, the British Foreign Office and the French Cabinet and War Department reached a secret understanding with each other. The secret understanding was: If France has a war with Germany, Britain must provide assistance.

Only some members of the British Cabinet knew about this matter. In the British government's organization, two or four members from among the eighteen or twenty Cabinet members often form a core group. This core group discusses important issues in advance. At that time, only Prime Minister Asquith, Foreign Secretary Grey, and War Secretary Haldane knew about the Anglo-French alliance in the Liberal Party Cabinet, while Naval Secretary Churchill only knew a little about it.

Other important Cabinet members, including former Finance Minister Lloyd George, Indian Affairs Minister Morley, and Barnes, were completely unaware of it. As for the general permanent officials—especially in the Foreign Office—they knew it very well. Most of the Cabinet members did not understand this matter until the eve of the Great War.

If the Prime Minister at that time had not been as particularly powerful as Gladstone or Lloyd George, the general permanent officials would have indirectly been the real rulers of the country.

The current core members of the British Cabinet are a few elders such as Prime Minister Baldwin, former Prime Minister MacDonald, Finance Minister Chamberlain, and Speaker of the House of Lords Hailsham. The young Foreign Secretary Eden is not within the scope of this core group.

Such things as the Hoare-Laval Pact for the partition of Abyssinia, the decision to revoke sanctions against Italy after the fall of Addis Ababa, and the withdrawal of the Abyssinian emperor are all many examples of this kind of secret policy and secret diplomacy work.

Regarding the first point, only the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, MacDonald, and former Foreign Secretary Hoare knew about this incident. The entire Cabinet did not discuss it before the secret was revealed, and everyone only knew the inside story after the French newspapers made a mistake.

Regarding the sanctions incident, the decision of the core group did not convene a full Cabinet meeting. Finance Minister Chamberlain only revealed some of the government's intentions at the Cabinet meeting, remaining silent about the entire situation, and naturally the Parliament knew even less about this decision.

From the above explanation of the actual work of British policy, anyone who can discern these traces can perceive a secret understanding between the important figures in power in London (such as senior permanent officials, core members of the Cabinet, bankers, etc.) and those who are close to Hitler and influenced by him.

To clearly understand the reasons for obtaining this understanding, we must remember that the British government is a government with a powerful party (which refers to the Conservative Party government.) It naturally sympathizes with the National Socialist Party, the Fascists, and the warlords everywhere. The right-wing politicians who oppose the government in France, and the leaders who hold power in Germany, Italy, Austria, and Greece, are all normal collaborators of such a government.

However, due to past alliances, previous alliances, and various relations with League of Nations member states, the entire British government still wants to cooperate with many governments of the left-wing neutral faction—that is, France, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, and the Nordic countries.

Today's Europe is really about to be divided into two groups. The first group is Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary. If the armed Fascist movement in Spain succeeds, then Spain will join the first group, which will increase its strategic power, especially threatening England.

Once a war breaks out, anyone who dares to use Spanish seaports facing the Pacific Ocean to utilize against the British fleet × as a base for cruisers and submarines will not only be of the utmost value, but also having a hostile Spain will make the naval port of Gibraltar ineffective, because the artillery units in the Spanish hinterland can control it.

Greece, under the leadership of General Metaxas, has now also joined the first group, and its military position in the central Mediterranean is very important.

Opposed to the first group are the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, and the Nordic countries. Belgium's attitude is doubtful, because its rulers and government see Germany's rearmament and feel that Belgium's position is becoming weaker, so there is a movement in Belgium to want to form friendly relations with its neighbor Germany. Poland has the same status as Belgium: but it is most afraid of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union is gradually becoming stronger militarily. As for England, until recently, its cooperation with this second group was through the League of Nations; but it now looks like a suspicious element in Paris, Moscow, and Prague (Czech Republic).

What about England?

In name, England is a member of the League of Nations, a democracy governed by an elected parliament, and supports maintaining the status quo in Europe and collective security based on the League of Nations Covenant to seek peace, but no matter how good it sounds in theory, the real creators of English policy now always want to maintain English territory and authority in a cheap way. There is no need to say anything else, just seeing the rapid increase in the German air force has made England afraid. London is not only the largest and richest city in Europe, the seat of the government of the world's largest empire, but also particularly vulnerable to air force attacks.

Berlin can use a method that has already been tested in the Ruhr region to obscure it with artificially created clouds; however, bombers can find the location of the city of London along the large bend of the Thames River. (To be continued)

### Overview of Yunnan Province's Salt Affairs

Unified control implemented last year, salt tax greatly increased; salt production from mines is costly and cannot compete with black salt

Kunming Correspondence. The salt in Yunnan Province has always been mineral salt, that is, it is taken from the salt ore or mineral brine in the stone mines to be made into salt. The whole province is divided into three salt areas, namely, the Heijing area, the Baijing area, and the Moheijing area. During the Qing Dynasty, each of the three salt areas had a salt affairs official called "Tiju." A commissioner was stationed at each salt field to manage all salt affairs administration and collect taxes. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the province has established audit sub-bureaus to handle matters such as tax collection, auditing, weighing, and distribution. In recent years, it has been deeply felt that auditing and administration are always opposed to each other, which only leads to differences in authority and does not help improve matters, and there are many constraints. Therefore, all places have successively had the managers of the audit sub-bureaus concurrently manage the duties of the transport commissioner in order to gradually achieve the effect of unified collection. However, the situation in remote Yunnan Province is special, and this concurrent policy has not yet been implemented. Therefore, since the salt administration in Guangdong and Guangxi changed, this full-time transport commissioner has become the only remaining relic of the past in the country. The various aspects of its production and sales are summarized below to inform those who care about salt affairs in the border province:

Salt Production Fields, Wells, and Salt-Making Methods

The salt areas in the province have the following salt fields and wells under their jurisdiction. The Heijing area has Heijing, Yuanyongjing, Alaojing, and Langjing, four fields. The Baijing area has Baijing, Qiaohoujing, Laji Jing, and Yunlongjing, four fields. The Moheijing area has Moheijing, Anbanjing, Xiangyanjing, Yixiangjing, and Sh膏jing, five fields. However, these are only the large salt wells that have field offices or tax bureaus. In addition, there are many small wells that are under the jurisdiction of the above fields and whose production and sales are all contracted by merchants. The procedures and time for making salt from the fields and wells are not all the same. The biggest distinction between the two is one is to boil salt from mineral brine, that is, to store the brine in brine ponds, and when it is time to boil, the brine is introduced into the pot, gradually boiled, until it is cooled into salt. The other is to make salt from salt mines, that is, to soak the mined ore in water in advance to obtain mineral brine, and then use it to boil salt. Also, because the shape of the salt is pot-shaped or cylindrical, it is called pot salt or cylinder salt. The method of extracting mineral brine is also not entirely the same in each well. Generally, hammerers and sand miners are hired to enter the mine caves. The hammerers chisel out the ore blocks in the cave, and the sand miners use baskets to transport the ore out of the cave. If it is brine, it is either carried out on the back in wooden barrels or sucked out with bamboo pumps. The cost of this mineral salt production is high because it requires chiseling and transporting ore on the one hand and using firewood and iron pots to boil it on the other hand. Every hundred catties costs about two to four yuan and seven jiao in cash, plus one jiao to nine jiao or so for expenses of establishing a gang, working, and repairing the mine caves. The cost is actually much higher than sea salt.

Salt System and Salt Catty Control

The entire territory of Yunnan Province mainly sells salt from the fields and wells in the three salt areas in the province. The salt from the Heijing field area is sold in 39 counties including Kunming in the province. The salt from the Baijing field area is sold in 23 counties including Dali and the Sheng-Long border. The salt from the Moheijing field area is sold in 16 counties including Mengzi and the Kaixi border. Fuzhou, which is connected to the Guangxi border with Guizhou, is preparing to allocate Guangdong salt. The eastern parts of the province, which are close to Sichuan and Guizhou, mostly sell Sichuan salt. Previously, the transportation and sales system in the three areas had a wide scope, and a self-shipping system was implemented. Only the Tenglong border in the remote areas and Fuzhou, where Guangdong salt was allocated, still used the contractor system. However, this was the situation before May of the 24th year of the Republic. Since the salt administration implemented "salt catty control" in May, the situation has changed greatly. The main changes are: ㊀ White salt is transferred to the six counties of Chuxiong and Guangtong in the Heijing area; ㊁ The Heijing area implements unified transportation and sales in the entire area; ㊂ Mo salt is designated for exclusive sales in Jianshui and other places (excluding Ning'er, Mojiang, and Yuanjiang), and unified transportation is implemented; ㊃ Anbanjing salt is also subject to unified transportation; ㊄ Hekou and Malipo are temporarily allowed to continue using sand salt. As for the implementation of this unified transportation and sales method, it is the Transportation and Sales Bureau, which is affiliated to the Transportation Office (reorganized from the Heijing Area Salt Transportation and Sales Office), and branch bureaus are established in various fields. Except for the provincial border, all internal borders are subject to allocated quotas and merchants are invited to contract for them, which is no different from the contractor system that shouts and negotiates prices.

Causes and Effects Before and After the Salt Catty Control

The surface of salt catty control is of course to dredge sales, but in fact it is to increase taxes. Tracing back to the local military and political expenses of Yunnan Province that are taken from the salt tax, there are regular taxes, auxiliary payments, military salaries, and road expenses under the salt share donation. Recently, due to the strict prohibition of opium in the spring, the original opium prohibition expenses cannot be maintained, and there is an urgent need to raise other funds to offset the loss. Therefore, the provincial mountain transportation office was ordered to implement this unified control plan, that is, to increase the "offset fee" by 4 yuan in new currency for each load of salt subject to unified transportation and sales (the transportation of white salt in the Heijing area is appropriately reduced by 1.6 yuan due to the long distance and high transportation costs, so that the value difference with black salt is even). For areas not subject to unified control, road expenses are increased by 1.4 yuan per load. In total, the estimated revenue from the offset fee is 10 million yuan in old Yunnan currency, equivalent to 1.2 million yuan in new currency. Combined with the various funds originally requisitioned from the salt tax, the annual amount must be 4.7 million yuan, which is already the largest source of local expenses in Yunnan Province. However, although it is planned to collect this huge amount of taxes, in addition to the various original taxes and donations that are collected by the salt tax bureaus, contractors are allowed to add a commercial interest of 1.2 yuan per load, so there is no need to use public funds. The expenses of the provincial Transportation and Sales Bureau are also designated to be collected from the temporary import tax on sand salt, which is about 2,000 yuan per year. It is said that this method conflicts greatly with the regulations and hinders the improvement of salt affairs. For example, sand salt was originally a profitable salt that was to be prohibited, but now it is considered public for the sake of collecting fees, which has a great impact on the production and sales of Yunnan salt. Therefore, the audit agency has not agreed to it from the beginning, but the Transportation Office, because it follows the orders of the provincial authorities, eventually finds a way to implement it. This procedure for collecting and remitting the offset fee is always handled by the Transportation Office, which cannot be said to be a special case in general salt affairs. As for the sales volume and the tax revenue, during the initial operation in May and June of last year, because the contractors were contracting and receiving salt one after another, there was a booming appearance for a time. When it came to July, August, and September, it had already turned dim. It is heard that within these three months, according to the total amount of 4.7 million yuan, more than 390,000 yuan should be allocated per month, and the difference in payment is more than 500,000 yuan. As for this year (the 25th year of the Republic of China) in April and May, a full year (how much was actually received is unknown, so it is not known what the results are.

Production and Sales Situation: Internal Smuggling and External Smuggling

According to the survey data in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the amount of salt produced in Yunnan Province was 655,000 piculs. The amount of salt released in the same year was 663,000 piculs. However, the accuracy of these figures is worthy of study. In addition to most of the large salt well areas having field offices and tax bureaus engaged in auditing and weighing, there are also some small wells that are contracted by merchants. The government only assigns merchants to pay taxes on a certain number of piculs of salt. As for how much salt is produced and how much salt is sold, they are not asked in detail. Because there are often cases where salt from small wells is used to sell in the sales areas of large salt wells. As for the private salt of the large salt wells themselves, it is of course unavoidable. External smuggling is black salt (sand salt) produced in Annam. This salt is sea salt, and its cost is even lower than that of mineral salt. In addition, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is direct, so transportation is naturally convenient and saves money. Hekou is a transportation hub, so the entry of smuggling salt is particularly high there. Malipo also has many entries because it is located on the border. In the past, in order to maintain the production of Yunnan salt, smuggling salt was strictly prohibited. However, since last year, it has been publicly recognized as normal trade. Although it is said to be increasing taxes under the guise of prohibition, its impact on the future of Yunnan salt is significant. When the Transportation Office of Yunnan planned and implemented unified control last year, it said that the offset fees collected were only taken from the layers of exploitation and embezzlement by officials, gentry, merchants, and peddlers in the past and returned to the public, and the purchase price for the people would not increase. However, the offset fee of 4 yuan per load (unified control area) or the road expense of 1.4 yuan has already been collected, but whether the so-called exploitation and embezzlement by officials, gentry, merchants, and peddlers can be removed is a question. It is stipulated that the Transportation and Sales Bureau and its branch bureaus shall allow contractors to contract and allow them to increase their commercial interest by 1.2 yuan per load. When calculated together, of course the burden on the people is only heavier than before. For example, in November of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the field price of salt from Alaojing was 55.80 yuan in Yunnan currency per load, and the sales price was 84.00 yuan. In the same month of the 24th year, the field price had increased to 82.80 yuan, and the sales price was even "15.00 yuan. The prices of the other fields have also increased in each other's company. As for the more the selling price of Yunnan salt increases, the more internal and external smuggling there is, which is a matter of course. Especially since smuggling salt is continuously entering the country, it will eventually lead to the sad fate of Yunnan salt declining day by day.

Current Commentary

### Anglo-Italian Agreement and European Peace

— Auxiliary

British Prime Minister Baldwin said in his New Year's message that 1937 would be a year of peace.  Anyone with even a slight understanding of recent international developments would probably not believe this.  However, Baldwin's "year of peace" may refer to the Anglo-Italian compromise in the Mediterranean. Indeed, if we observe from a realistic standpoint, the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement, signed on the 2nd and announced on the 3rd, is indeed a new factor stabilizing the European situation.  Although there are many factors disturbing European peace recently, the Italian conflict stemming from the East African War is the most important of these disturbing factors.

The reason why the East African War caused a serious conflict between Britain and Italy is that Mussolini's annexation of Abyssinia has severely impacted Britain's superior interests in the Mediterranean and Africa. Although everyone knows that the Mediterranean is Britain's sea route and the British Empire's aorta, Mussolini wanted to turn it into an Italian inland lake.  This naturally aroused strong opposition from Britain.  Therefore, the conflict between Britain and Italy over the past year has become an important feature on the European political stage.  Now that these two major opposing countries can actually sign a Gentleman's Agreement, vowing to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean and eliminate past disputes, it will naturally contribute significantly to European peace.

However, we must recognize that this kind of peace is not genuine peace, but rather a realistic peace.  This is because its foundation is built on sacrificing the interests of small and weak nations.  Originally, the Mediterranean Agreement was able to be established because the exchange conditions between Britain and Italy had been substantially satisfied. Since Italy's victory in the East African War, it has not only inflicted a major blow to British interests in the eastern Mediterranean, but also obtained the lease and current rights to the Balearic Islands from the rebels in the Spanish Civil War, posing a major threat to Britain's military position in the western Mediterranean.  Although Britain has tried to resist Italy's successive offensives, the old lion was ultimately no match for the black-shirted Prime Minister's roar.  Therefore, it had no choice but to propose exchange conditions in order to seek temporary compromise.  The so-called exchange conditions are that Britain de facto recognizes Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, converts its embassy in A King to a consulate general, and Italy recognizes Britain's original position in the Mediterranean and withdraws Italian troops from the Balearic Islands.  Although these exchange conditions are not directly stipulated in the Mediterranean Agreement, they are indeed an important part of the Mediterranean Agreement.

Since the Anglo-Italian compromise is the result of realistic peace, what impact will it have on the European political situation? Judging from the current situation, this is naturally a new factor stabilizing the European situation. However, if we hope that Italy can break away from the fascist bloc and restore the Stresa Front of Britain, France, and Italy, it would be too optimistic.  Consider that at the time of the signing of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, weren't Italian volunteers still joining the Spanish rebels in large numbers to fight?  Didn't Gayda, the spokesman for the black-shirted Prime Minister, say that the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement had no impact on the close relationship between Italy and Germany?  Moreover, if this precedent is applied to the Far East, it will be extremely detrimental to our national liberation movement.  Therefore, we should clearly recognize the true face of this kind of realistic peace.

### Pope's Illness

Worrisome Heart Weakness

Vatican City - The severity of the Pope's condition can be verified in the first official Vatican bulletin on the Pope's condition. It is said that the Pope's heart condition is worrisome and may be dangerous at any time. It is heard that Dr. Buonanni Bo, a Roman medical expert who performed minor surgery on the Pope several months ago, will be invited to consult today. At the same time, officials announced that the local discomfort suffered by the Pope can gradually improve and is expected to fully recover, but his heart condition is quite worrisome because the Pope is already old. It is said that the root cause of the Pope's illness this time is due to a phenomenon of arteriosclerosis. (Reuters, 5th)

### Opening of the New U.S. Congress

Will First Discuss Neutrality Law, Paying Attention to the Situation in Spain

[Washington] The "Victory Congress," in which the Democratic Party occupies an absolute majority, will open tomorrow afternoon. The opening date has always been January 3rd, "but because that day falls on a Sunday, the previous Congress decided to change it to the 5th." According to the Constitution, Vice President Garner is the Speaker of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House is likely to be Penke. After the opening, it is likely that a decision will be made to hold a joint meeting of the two houses to count the votes of this general election. The votes have been certified by the governors of each state and sent to the State Department. At that time, Secretary of State Hull will send a copy to the joint meeting for counting. After the counting, the legal procedures for the general election will be completed. In the past, the Democratic and Republican parties in the two houses were divided into left and right seats. In this Congress, because there are too many Democrats and the Republicans still have differing opinions, some people speculate that it may become a "one-party" Congress. It is also possible that the House of Representatives has a total of 334 Democratic members, 89 Republican members, 2 Farmer-Labor members, 1 Progressive member, and 1 Independent member. The Senate has a total of 75 Democratic members, 17 Republican members, 2 Farmer-Labor members, 1 Progressive member, and 2 Independent members. (National Telegram, 4th)

[Washington] House Speaker Penke has prepared a temporary motion by President Roosevelt regarding the U.S. Neutrality Law, and said that he has asked the Democratic caucus to immediately re-elect the Democratic members of the Foreign Affairs Committee as committee members, so that the government's proposal can be discussed when necessary. At the same time, the foreign affairs authorities said that if the relationship between Germany and Spain is tense to the point of a state of war, President Roosevelt will immediately order an arms embargo without waiting for the two countries to formally declare war. The authorities believe that the feud between Spain and Germany is deepening, and within a few days, Germany will be able to find a legal basis for the president to impose an arms embargo on any side in Spain. (National Telegram, 4th)

[Washington] Officials are now closely watching the situation in Spain to determine whether a state of war between Spain and Germany already exists. If so, the Neutrality Law can be invoked to prohibit the transport of arms to Spain. However, as of now, the information received by the United States is insufficient to prove that a state of war has legally occurred between West Germany. Officials believe that if European countries do not recognize the state of war between Germany and Spain, the United States should not do so in advance. Currently, during the war between Italy and Abyssinia, the United States was the first to implement arms embargo measures, but under the current circumstances, it seems appropriate to delay the decision based on past experience. (Havas, 4th)

[New York] Six planes were recently handled by Villa Merl Company and loaded onto the freighter "Marconda" in Brooklyn Port, preparing to transport them to Valencia, Spain, and deliver them to the Republican government of that country. The manifest stated that they were old commercial aircraft, including the "Peace Wife" plane that famous entertainer Li Quman and aviator Merrill flew across the Atlantic in September last year. The reason why the company was able to obtain an export permit from the State Department for these aircraft is due to the current Neutrality Law, which stipulates that arms embargo clauses do not apply to domestic wars. In addition, four ambulances and a batch of clothes donated by the American Friends of the Spanish Republic were also transported to Spain on the freighter to be donated to the government army of that country. According to the chairman of the association, there are still many ambulances that will be shipped to the Western countries within days. (Havas, 4th)

[Washington] The Sea and Land Army Magazine published a letter today, stating that the U.S. Neutrality Law is ineffective without sufficient strength behind it. Only a strong country can be neutral. Preparations for the reality of military power can prevent the ambitions of aggressors. If German soldiers had known that we were preparing for war during the European War, they would never have adopted a submarine strategy, which caused us to participate in the war. The current sea, land, and air forces are fairly satisfactory, but they should still be strengthened. (National, 4th)

### U.S. Auto Industry Labor Strike

Government Intervenes in Mediation, Management Takes a Tough Stance

Flint, Michigan - After the labor strike at General Motors Corporation, President Roosevelt recently intervened in the mediation. Earlier, the company's president, Sloan, had yesterday denounced the striking workers as "labor dictators" and refused to negotiate with them, saying that if the strikers did not immediately reach an agreement with the management, the company would have no choice but to shut down all its factories. Indeed, in addition to the current 40,000 striking workers, another 95,000 workers will lose their jobs. In addition, Sloan insisted that negotiations should be conducted separately with the workers in each factory, and was unwilling to negotiate with the United Automobile Workers of America, which the striking workers belong to. It is generally believed that the labor side will decide its attitude by noon tomorrow. In the event that a general strike is advocated in the automobile industry, as many as 250,000 workers will be affected. Currently, workers in various factories belonging to General Motors Corporation continue to occupy factory buildings in defiance of court orders, resulting in conflicts with the police. As a result, one police officer and two strikers were injured. (Havas, 4th)

[Washington] After Assistant Secretary of Labor McGrady returned here from San Francisco to mediate the shipping strike, officials are about to intervene in the threat of a general strike by General Motors workers in order to avoid it. Today, McGrady consulted with Lewis, chairman of the Industrial Organizations Committee, for a long time, and tried his best to solicit the opinions of the workers and how the Department of Labor could assist in peacefully resolving the situation. At the same time, Michigan Governor Murphy also met with members of the Automobile Workers' Executive Committee in Detroit. Murphy has expressed that if there is a need for him, he will act as a mediator. It is heard that the workers are asking for increased wages and improved treatment. If the strike materializes, the number of participants will be no less than 200,000. This morning, representatives of the Automobile Workers' Union and the Industrial Organizations Committee held a meeting to consider the steps to be taken to fulfill their demands.

At the same time, the surging labor unrest has not subsided. Thirteen of General Motors Corporation's trust departments and sixty-nine factories were shut down yesterday. If the strike situation cannot be eased, more factories will continue to close. This can be affirmed. (Reuters, 4th)

### Spanish Rebels Launch Major Offensive on Madrid

Capital City Bombed, Casualties Heavy, 10,000 Italian Soldiers Join the Battle

[London] According to intelligence received by the British government, a large number of Italian volunteers, totaling more than 6,500, landed in Cadiz around Christmas. It is estimated that in the past two weeks, the total number of Italian volunteers who have arrived in Spain to assist the National Army in combat has reached 10,000. (Reuters, 5th)

Madrid - In the past two days, the National Army has launched a major offensive on Madrid, creating a new 16-mile-long front, starting from the northwest of the capital city, Tong Keluna Avenue, expanding westward, passing Majoda Honda, and ending at Valtai Morillo, the closest place to the capital city is Aralajaca and Madrid Golf Course, only two miles apart. The National Army is advancing north to contact the National Army troops advancing south from the Juadala Mountain Range at the same time. The National Army on the northern front is posing a threat to the government army and has occupied a superior position. At present, the government army is trapped in the encirclement of the National Army's two-pronged advance. The situation is only to retreat or meet the enemy separately. (Reuters, 5th)

Madrid - The National Army bombed with fifteen bomber planes this afternoon. The situation was so tragic that it was the only time the capital had been besieged. As of now, 27 people have died and 195 have been injured. Many places in the city have suffered losses. Most of the bombed buildings are workers' residences. These houses are quite simple in construction and have no bomb protection facilities. Once bombed, they collapse immediately. The broken walls and ruins are everywhere. The scene after the bombing of French Street is especially tragic. The street is covered with blood, especially in front of the food shops, where blood flows into rivers. This is because women were gathered there, waiting to shop, and the ruthless bombs suddenly dropped, and they could not avoid them, causing death and casualties. As of 4 pm, the remaining bodies had not yet been cleared, and the bloody and blurred were unbearable to look at. In some streets, after being bombed, there were bomb marks everywhere, and there was no complete place. The windows of the houses along the road were wide open. Occasionally, residents did not avoid the danger and took the remaining furniture to spend the night in underground tunnels, and some moved to the homes of relatives and friends. Although these residents have experienced a great robbery, they still hold on to calmness, which makes people feel even more pity. The bombs dropped by the National Army planes weighed 150 kilograms, and many incendiary bombs were also dropped. The former residence of Duke Saint Helen, the cousin of the deposed King Alfonso, is magnificently constructed and luxuriously furnished. It is one of the famous buildings in the capital city and was also hit and burned in part. At present, the sound of artillery fire around Guoguo is very clear, indicating that the National Army is intensifying its advance on the capital city. (Havas, 4th)

Madrid - The fighting on the northwest side of the city is still extremely fierce. The front line between the two sides is 20 kilometers long. Although the National Army broke through the government army's defense line in several places, the government army immediately launched a counterattack in other places and threatened the rear positions of the National Army. Therefore, both sides have won and lost. The government army is currently transferring fresh troops from the mountainous areas in the northwest to support the city of Eskoria. The survival of this city is of great importance. The general public here is now paying close attention to the fighting there. (Reuters, 5th)

### Italy Continues to Send Volunteers, Britain Quite Regrets

At the Time of the Conclusion of the Gentleman's Agreement, Italy Intensified Its Intervention in the Spanish War

[London] Officials have recently confirmed that as many as 10,000 Italians have landed in Cadiz, Spain, in the past two weeks. Among them, 6,000 landed in the port on December 22 last year, and another 4,000 arrived on the 1st of this month. Although these Italians are all equipped with military uniforms, they do not carry weapons. Officials also said that the British government believes that Italy's actions are obviously a continuation of violating the non-intervention agreement, and therefore expresses regret. Although the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war and the issue of Anglo-Italian relations are two completely different matters, the Gentleman's Agreement has just been established, and the situation of Italy sending volunteers has occurred again. This is indeed regrettable, because the key point of the Gentleman's Agreement is to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean, especially to maintain the territorial integrity of Spain. (Havas, 5th)

[London] Labor Party and By Party people claim that the government knew that 4,000 Italian troops had landed in Cadiz, Spain last Friday when the Anglo-Italian agreement was concluded. The week before, 6,500 people landed in the port. The United Kingdom seems eager to prevent a major war in Europe, so it is willing to see the Spanish Nationalists win as soon as possible, and is willing to tacitly approve Italy's intervention in the Spanish civil war to promote the victory of the Spanish National Army, and intends to use the name of the non-intervention agreement to cover up foreign countries' continued assistance to the Spanish National Army, but the United Kingdom will try to prevent Germany from dominating Spain.

According to political figures, this reply is very friendly in its wording and was drafted after obtaining the full consent of Germany.

### Germany Issues Ultimatum to the Spanish Government

Deadline to Return German Ship and Cargo - Otherwise, Sell the Two Detained Ships

[Berlin] A semi-official communiqué was recently published, stating that the commander of the German fleet stationed on the Spanish coast sent a letter of Mayton from the cruiser Königsberg to the Spanish Republican government in Valencia, demanding that the Basque Autonomous Region authorities return all the goods confiscated from the German merchant ship Barros and release one arrested Spanish passenger before 8:00 a.m. on the 8th. Otherwise, the German government will sell the two detained Spanish merchant ships, Aragon and Malta, and all their cargo. The communiqué also stated that after the sale of these ships, the accounts of the Basque government's detention of the Barros' passengers and cargo can be considered settled. However, if Spanish warships engage in piracy against German merchant ships in the future, Germany will have no choice but to take other measures to deal with them. (Havas, 5th)

[Berlin] Political figures recently revealed that the German government's reply to the notes submitted by the United Kingdom and France will be submitted to the British and French ambassadors tomorrow. (Havas, 5th)

Portuguese Capital City - The governments of the United Kingdom and France submitted notes to the governments of Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia at the end of last year, requesting that they stop sending volunteers to Spain. It is now known that the Portuguese government recently submitted replies to the British Ambassador to Portugal, Sir Winfield, and the French Envoy to Portugal, Amirillo. (Havas, 5th)

[Berlin] According to responsible sources, the foreign side has been uneasy after the German warships recently detained the Spanish merchant ships "Aragon" and "Malta". Therefore, the German authorities do not intend to take other actions, that is, they do not intend to detain ships belonging to the West Country government again. In addition, political figures explained the negotiations conducted by the commander of the German fleet stationed on the Spanish coast to the Republican government in Valencia, stating that their purpose was to "limit" the repercussions that could be caused by the Barros detention incident. If the Basque government does not return the goods detained by the Barros and release the arrested Spanish passengers, Germany will sell the two West Country merchant ships, "Aragon" and "Malta", and settle accounts with the Spanish National Army government, because the National Army government is the only West Country government recognized by Germany.

### Spanish Rebels Guarantee Britain

Respect British Ships' Navigation Rights

[London] Regarding the incident in which the British merchant ship Ethel-Leeb was fired upon by a Spanish National Army armed fishing boat in the Strait of Gibraltar, responsible people recently stated that the Cadiz port West Country National Army authorities have explained to the British side that the fishing boats mistakenly identified the Ethel-Leeb as a ship of a certain country with suspicious behavior, so they fired upon it, but did not board the ship to carry out inspections. It is said that an order has now been issued to respect British ships, so this matter can be said to have come to an end. (Havas, 5th)

### Western Rebel Army Adopts German Tactics

Concentrated Assaults - Defending Troops Resolutely Resist

Madrid - Yesterday, the Nationalist army launched an attack on government forces in the area of the town of Boadilla, in the northern suburbs of Madrid. They first subjected the government forces to intense shelling by artillery and bombing by aircraft, followed by concentrated assaults. It is said that there are many German soldiers in the Nationalist army, hence the use of German-style concentrated attack methods. The people's militia under the government forces put up a strong resistance. Even when the Nationalist army attacked to the front of the trenches, they still fought to the death and refused to retreat. At 11:00 a.m., three Nationalist tri-motor aircraft dropped bombs on the town of Majadahonda, but three government fighter planes immediately took off to engage them in battle. Eventually, two Nationalist aircraft were shot down, one an Italian Fiat and the other a German Junkers. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 4th)

Hengtai - German pilots today bombed the port of Bilbao from the air from Vitoria, but one plane was shot down by Spanish government aircraft. The two German pilots in the plane parachuted to safety and were immediately arrested. The two men were found to be carrying permits signed by the rebel leader General Franco. Two other German planes were shot down near Villarreal. The Bilbao government has protested to Germany because Germany is assisting the rebel army with military supplies and airplane pilots.

### Japanese Warships Active Along Changtai River

They All Fired Test Shots at the Shore - Japanese Vessels Also Engaged in Measuring Water Levels

Changshu Correspondence - On the evening of New Year's Day, more than ten Japanese warships were spotted in Yanglinkou, Qiyakou, and other places in Taicang County. They fired machine guns at the shore for half an hour. The entire county immediately declared a state of special martial law, and the residents were very alarmed. Later, at dawn, the warships sailed upstream one after another. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently investigating the truth of this matter. However, the actions of the Japanese warships that night were not limited to Taicang County alone. According to news from the security team here, at about 2:00 a.m. on New Year's Day, as many as fourteen Japanese warships sailed past Baizhekou and Yemao in the county. One or two of them were also cruising in between, about eight kilometers from the shore. When they passed Yemao, they also fired machine guns at the shore. Because the distance was far, the range of the bullets was not enough, and no impact was made. They left after less than five minutes. Because it was midnight and the time was quite short, most residents did not know, and no impact occurred. On the evening of the 4th, definite news was received from Shazhou City in the Seventh District that at about 3:00 p.m. on the 2nd, a Japanese merchant ship sailed to Zhongxing Port in its jurisdiction (near the border between this county in the northwest and Nantong). They engaged in measuring water levels, and a small number of sailors landed on the shore and wandered around. Nearby residents, fearing that an accident might occur, together with the Public Security Bureau, went to persuade them to stop landing and stop measuring. They then telegraphed the Jiangyin garrison authorities to send a team to the port, and the ship left.

### Completion of Zhongzheng Bridge in Nanchang

Spanning the Gan River, a Major Construction Project for Transportation in Jiangxi - Total Length of 3,500 Feet, Costing One Million Yuan

Nanchang Correspondence - The old urban area of Nanchang is separated from Niuhang by the Gan River. The river water is vast, covering an area of three or four li. Boat crossings are slow and difficult to guarantee safety. There has long been talk of building a bridge. In the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1934], Chairman Chiang was stationed in Jiangxi, suppressing the bandits. People from all walks of life then decided to build the Zhongzheng Bridge across the Gan River as a memorial. The bridge is located at Tangzi River in the west of the city. It was designed by Wu Qiyou, a technician from the Ministry of Railways, and built by the Shanghai Fook Kee Factory. Construction began on December 20th of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1934]. During pile driving, due to the unusual geological conditions, which were beyond the expectations of the design and exploration, the project was suspended. At that time, the construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was also underway, so there was a proposal to have the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway pass over the Gan River via this bridge and connect with the Nanchun Railway. However, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway eventually took the western route, crossing the Gan River at Zhangshu to reach Pingxiang, so the bridge was designated as a highway bridge. (Construction restarted in the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1935], and was completed at the end of the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1936].) The entire bridge is 3,535 feet and 6 inches long. The east bank approach bridge is 124 feet and 6 and a half inches long, the west bank approach bridge is 443 feet long, and the main bridge has 28 spans, each with a span of 106 feet. The main bridge is 2,968 feet long. The bridge piles and piers are made of steel structures and covered with concrete. The upper frame is a 100-foot, six-section lower-bearing girder steel beam. The bridge deck is 26 feet wide (the central roadway is 18 feet wide, and the sidewalks on both sides are 4 feet wide). The roadway has a load capacity of 10 tons, and the sidewalks have a load capacity of 70 pounds per square foot. The bridge deck is generally paved with foreign pine. The total cost of the bridge was initially planned to be 641,700 yuan, but due to changes in the bridge foundation plan, the cost increased to 967,646 yuan. The source of funding, in addition to the 200,000 yuan allocated by the Chairman's Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, the remaining amount was shared equally by the Nanchun Railway and the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Administration. The bridge held a test driving ceremony on New Year's Day this year. Pine and cypress archways were erected on the east and west banks of the bridge, adorned with the golden characters "Zhongzheng Bridge Test Driving Ceremony," and there was also a car, fully decorated with flowers, with the words "Celebrating the New Year's Day Test Driving Ceremony." At about 8:00 a.m. that morning, military and government officials and representatives from all walks of life gathered on the east bank of the bridge. After performing the ceremony, they played music and fired cannons to open the bridge to traffic. Participants followed the car and walked to the west bank, and then dispersed after the ceremony. At that time, crowds of people on both banks, surging with thousands of heads, came to visit the bridge, coming and going, which was very lively. From a distance, it looks like a long rainbow hanging on the river, like building a city of people. From morning to evening, it was extremely crowded. With the completion of the bridge, the Jiangxi-Guangdong, Jiangxi-Hubei, Jiangxi-Hunan, Jiangxi-Zhejiang, and Jiangxi-Fujian highways have been connected into one, and the Jiangxi-Zhejiang and Nanchun railways can also avoid the trouble of transportation and transshipment. It is truly a new era in the history of transportation in Southeast China.

### Review of the Past Year and Work Guidelines for this Year in Nanjing

Mayor Ma's Report

Nanjing Correspondence - The City Government held a Premier's Memorial Week yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m. All staff members attended. Mayor Ma, as chairman, led the ceremony and delivered a report, which stated: "Today is the first Memorial Week of the 26th year of the Republic of China [i.e. 1937]. Since the founding of the Republic in the early years, due to the shallow knowledge of the general public, there was much doubt about the Republic of China, which led to internal and external troubles that plagued the country. Until the 15th year of the Republic of China [i.e. 1926], the National Revolutionary Army vowed to launch the Northern Expedition, unifying the country and establishing the capital in Nanjing. The country gradually began to turn around. After ten years of government efforts to strengthen governance, all aspects have made considerable progress. Unexpectedly, last year, disasters occurred. First, there was the dissent in the Southwest, and then the rebellion in Xi'an. The situation of unity was almost broken again. Fortunately, with the charismatic appeal of the leader and the sanctions of the entire public opinion, it was resolved invisibly, turning danger into safety. Therefore, this year's New Year's Day, from the capital to all parts of the country, was celebrated together, and the enthusiastic situation was unprecedented, which shows that the people's knowledge has greatly improved, and they have a considerable understanding of the concept of the country and national consciousness. This is all the result of the leader's promotion of spiritual education in recent years, and it is our greatest success in the past 25 years. Regarding construction, the completion of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the progress of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, and the accessibility of highways throughout the country have all had great benefits for politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. In addition, the quantity of agricultural products imported in previous years was quite alarming. Last year, however, there were bumper harvests in various places, and the amount of imports was greatly reduced. At the same time, the people's purchasing power also increased, and local cloth in various places was sold out, which shows that the national economy is becoming more and more prosperous, and the future of the country is very optimistic.

As for the construction of this city in the past year, although there have been no significant achievements, all aspects have also made considerable progress. Regarding social relief, all the refugees and beggars in the city have been taken in large numbers to the Batu Mountain and Dengfu Mountain Relief Homes, where they are given education and training. Therefore, the groups of refugees and beggars that used to gather in groups have gradually disappeared. Regarding education, in the past, there were only more than 30,000 primary school students in the city. After two years of efforts, the number has now increased to more than 80,000. The panic of being out of school has been reduced by more than 80%. The number of secondary schools has also increased by three compared to before. Although the content cannot be called complete, they have all made considerable progress. Regarding roads, the roads built in the past two years are almost equal to the achievements of the previous eight years. Regarding land administration, land registration in the urban area has been completed as scheduled, and land tax has begun to be collected. Land in rural areas is also being surveyed to comply with Premier Sun Yat-sen's idea of equalizing land ownership in the Principle of People's Livelihood. Regarding finance, the total expenditure in the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1935] was more than 8 million yuan, with a debt of only 600,000 to 700,000 yuan, of which 500,000 to 600,000 yuan was for the previous administration's debt repayment. Therefore, the debt incurred in the past two years is actually very small. Last year, in order to expand the water plant equipment and build sewers, a loan of more than 1 million yuan was specially borrowed from the Central Trust Bureau, which has not yet been used and is temporarily deposited in the bank. Therefore, although our expenditures have increased compared to before in the past two years, the progress of our undertakings has increased several times compared to before. Regarding hygiene, the number of outpatient clinics has increased to more than ten, and free treatment is provided to patients more than 50,000 times per month. The business of the municipal hospital is also very developed, and the number of beds is often insufficient to meet the demand. Regarding the National Labor Service, in the spring of last year, the National Labor Service was used to build river dikes along the Yangtze River, with more than 400 soldiers and more than 3,000 civilian workers participating, building more than 31 kilometers of earthen dikes along the Yangtze River. After July, prisoners, vagrants, etc. were used to engage in various simple projects, successively demolishing the barracks of the moat and burying the large stone foundations of the Ming Imperial Palace, totaling more than 3,700 workdays. In addition, 1.5 kilometers of the Yilong Bridge River was dredged, totaling about 16,000 workdays. Regarding this year's National Labor Service, preparations are currently underway, and it has been decided to hold it in both urban and rural areas at the same time. In the urban area, it has been decided to dredge the Qinhuai River, selecting the five most shallow sections from Sixiang Bridge to Tiechuang Bridge, with a total length of 4,860 meters, which is estimated to involve 31,205 cubic meters of earth, requiring the conscription of 31,205 people. The Public Works Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Autonomous Affairs Office, and the Capital National Military Training Association are actively preparing. In the rural area, the Shangxinhe District has decided to build the North Binxiang Dike, which is estimated to be about 9 kilometers long, involving about 74,190 cubic meters of earth, and 12,500 people will be conscripted to complete it in 60 days. Xiaoling and Yanziqi two rural districts have decided to organize and deepen the water storage ponds, with a number of about 2,000, and each district will collect 8,000 workers. The method of conscripting workers has been reviewed and approved by the Public Works Bureau and the three rural district heads, and work can begin on the 15th of this month. Regarding National Economic Construction, since the Nanjing City Branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee was formally established on September 16th of last year, the first plenary committee meeting was held on October 3rd. Proposals such as "Developing the city's cooperative undertakings to promote economic construction," "Guiding the improvement of the city's agricultural by-products and special products," and "Planning the production and sales cooperation of domestic goods markets in various sectors of the city to promote the development of domestic goods and seek the prosperity of Nanjing" have been resolved and handed over to various groups for review. In addition, the "Summary of General Principles of National Economic Construction" issued by the General Assembly and the "Industries and Rural By-Products that Various Localities Should Pay Attention To" have been forwarded to various groups and relevant agencies for investigation and planning.

The above are the major achievements of the city's work this year. However, we must not be satisfied with these subtle achievements, because it is still far from our ideal new Nanjing, and we need to continue to work hard this year. As the saying goes, "The plan for the year lies in the spring," so we should determine the direction of this year's work at the beginning of the year, and identify several key tasks to focus on. ㊀ Regarding primary school education, there are still one or two million children out of school. We should try our best to find ways to give these one or two million out-of-school children the opportunity to attend school. Although this year's financial resources are still very tight, we should expand schools as much as possible within the possible range, using the most economical methods. For example, the Central Road and Peijia Bridge primary school buildings built last year were built using the most economical methods, using wood, and there is no apparent decline in teaching effectiveness. Even primary school buildings in Japan and the United States are mostly built with wood. ㊁ Regarding mass training, a compulsory literacy policy should be strictly implemented for illiterate adults. Since the city piloted compulsory literacy education in the spring of last year, a total of more than 8,000 students were enrolled by the summer, and 6,000 students graduated. All mass schools, mass schools, and mass literacy classes only increased by more than 340 classes, enrolling more than 15,000 students. However, due to the lack of police and the lack of punitive measures against the masses who refused to enroll, the effectiveness was not great. This year, we will actively promote it. The Social Affairs Bureau has already drafted a plan to improve mass schools in Nanjing. The biggest change is to integrate military training with literacy, because the former's purpose is to teach war, and the latter's purpose is to make people understand shame. In today's training of the masses, the two cannot be separated and each go its own way. It will then be officially implemented on July 1st with a clear order for compulsory literacy education. ㊂ Regarding autonomy, in the past, progress was inevitably slightly slow because the autonomous laws and regulations were not yet complete. Now that various autonomous laws and regulations have been promulgated and implemented by the central government, we should actively carry them out this year, hoping to complete them all this year. In short, our policy has always focused on education and people's livelihood, and we hope that you will all adhere to this policy and work hard without any slack. You should know that work is our life, and do not regard the agency as a temporary residence, and perfunctorily deal with things and muddle through. When I was in the United States, the car king Ford gave me a book called "My Life is in Work." This book expounds the essence of life should be based on service in great detail. I still regard it as the most truthful. I hope that you will devote all your energy to your work from today onwards, and you will surely achieve great results. I have followed Premier Sun Yat-sen since I was young and engaged in revolution until today, and I have never dared to be complacent. Although I dare not laugh at myself as a model for you, I very much hope that you can take work as your life, and do not underestimate yourself because today's position is too low, and give up on yourself. If you can make a decision, be loyal to your duties, and the superiors will be fair, and meritorious service will be rewarded, and there will be a day when you will stand out. In addition, I hope that you will all be law-abiding and refrain from corruption and malfeasance from today onwards, because you have been trusted by me and entrusted with your duties. You should take my heart as your heart and my words as your training, and keep yourself clean. Don't disappoint my ardent expectations. Now, in order to unify revenue and expenditure, centralize the purchase of materials, and increase administrative efficiency, the House has formally established the Management Committee last November. We hope to work harder this year to achieve the greatest results with the most economical methods, and to build Nanjing into a model city for the whole country in the shortest possible time."

Shortage of Copper Coins in the Market

### Qiu Feihai Memorial Cup to Host National University Tennis Championships

Currently Being Planned by the Sports Association Organizing Committee

Mr. Qiu Feihai, a national tennis player of our country, unfortunately passed away in Penang last autumn. Chinese and foreign tennis circles alike deeply mourned his loss. After Mr. Hu Xiansheng confirmed the news of Mr. Qiu's passing, in addition to initiating the Qiu Feihai Memorial Tournament last autumn and collecting funds to provide condolences to Mr. Qiu's family, he also initiated fundraising to establish a permanent memorial cup. Mr. Hu entrusted the All China Athletic Federation to handle the memorial events in subsequent years. The Sports Association has already passed the acceptance of this proposal at the board meeting. The circumstances have been recorded in previous reports. It is now learned that since accepting this proposal, the Sports Association has organized a committee to handle it specifically. The committee members are concurrently appointed by the original China Tennis Committee of the association. Moreover, because Mr. Qiu was a great artist of his generation, it is necessary to hold a national-level championship competition to fully demonstrate Mr. Qiu's greatness. Therefore, the All China University Tennis Championships have been initiated, to be held once a year starting this year. The memorial cup will serve as the trophy, and all competition regulations are currently being planned by the committee. Once finalized, they will be announced publicly. As for whether participants will be represented by schools or provinces and cities, it still needs to be decided after consideration.

### West Qing Basketball

Fudan Wins Big Over Nanqing, Jinan Defeats Hornets

It was the first time that Fudan and Nanqing, of the West Qing Basketball University Group, played against each other last night. Fudan is already implicitly the champion of this session, and the team members are also tall. Although Nanqing has been quite successful in the West Qing rooms recently, they are ultimately short in stature and also flustered. Therefore, after Chen Lin opened the scoring, Fudan added three more balls in a row. However, Nanqing's skills are not lacking. Chen and Xu then hit the bullseye again, chasing to eight to six. But it was a flash in the pan. After that, they repeatedly failed to score, and Fudan's defense was tight. It wasn't until twelve to six that they were awarded a point. Then, after eighteen to seven, they scored another point. The first half ended at twenty-one to nine. After the restart, Fudan took the lead in one go. Qiu, Zhou, and Chen scored four more points in a row, increasing the score to twenty-nine to nine. After Nanqing called a timeout, they did show improvement. Although Chen and Lin are small, their shooting is extremely accurate, with one person scoring six goals in a row. Throwing from the free throw line also earned a goal, advancing to thirty-nine to sixteen, and then increasing to thirty-nine to twenty-two. Afterwards, the effort gradually evened out, and both sides scored alternately. In the end, Fudan's skills were superior, and they had already gained the greatest advantage in the first half, ending with fifty-four to twenty-nine. Nanqing gave up. In the second game, the Hornets played against Jinan in the Independent Group. The two teams had created a close game of thirty-six to thirty-three in the previous cycle. Yesterday, Jinan was cautious, fearing to repeat the previous mistakes. The Hornets' recent technology has also advanced considerably, no longer as harmless as before. After the jump ball, the Hornets' right forward, Wang Huating, immediately advanced along the edge to the basket and scored with a tip-in, opening the scoring. Jinan's style was purer. Cai, Wang, and Zheng scored with free throws and dribbles, instantly exceeding by six to two. At this time, Zhang Wenyuan had finished changing clothes and immediately took the field, replacing Zheng Zicheng, and became even sharper. Tao Shaosheng scored on both throws and free throws, chasing to five to six, only one point behind. From eight to six, to ten to eight, there was only a one-ball difference. Kuang Yao Ya and Wang Nanzhen then scored in a row. The Hornets called a timeout. After the restart, the situation was dull. After several spins, Jinan's Cai and Zheng scored again, eighteen to eight. Jinan then led by more than ten points. Afterwards, the Hornets' Wang Huating scored three goals in a row, while Jinan only had Zheng Jin Gan score one goal. The first half ended with twenty to fourteen, with Jinan leading. After the restart, Jinan replaced Wen Qiyao with Yuan Zejian. The Hornets still responded with their original lineup. After Zheng Gong broke the deadlock, Zhang Wenyuan retaliated in the same way. Soon, Zheng and Zhao committed fouls. Zhao scored, but Zheng did not, and Zheng had already committed four fouls and left the field. Wen Qiyao was still substituted in. Twenty-two to seventeen. At this time, the difference was still only five points. Unexpectedly, after twenty-four to nineteen, Wang Nanzhen scored two throws, and Kuang added one free throw. Jinan had already led by ten points in an instant. But the Hornets were full of sting, and Wang Huating and Zhang Wenyuan scored three points, twenty-nine to twenty-five. The difference was only four points again, and the situation became tense. Kuang Yaozhi threw in. The entire Jinan army, eager to win, failed to score on any more throws. Tao Shaosheng scored twice under the basket, twenty-nine to thirty-one, making the audience nervous. Finally, with little time left, Jinan's Fu Shanyuan and Zejian were awarded one point, ending with thirty-two to twenty-nine. The Hornets were badly defeated. In total, the Hornets scored three more points than Jinan in the second half. The Hornets were defeated by three points in both the previous cycle of thirty-six to thirty and this game, which is also a coincidence. There are three games scheduled for today. The match between Hujiang and John is likely to be close. Qingguang is likely to win against Mailingyi.

The results are recorded below:

Furthermore, in order to celebrate Generalissimo Chiang's escape from danger, the association initiated the "Leader Cup" intercity billiards competition.

### On China's Non-Perishability (3)

— Pan Gongzhan

China has suffered foreign aggression for nearly a century since 1842. We have almost become accustomed to being bullied and oppressed. Germany only began to be bound by the Treaty of Versailles in 1918. Therefore, we must build our nation, and we cannot compare ourselves to Germany in terms of time. Japan is a small island nation, and the foreign aggression it has suffered is not as significant as what China is currently experiencing. However, through the Meiji Restoration, it transformed from weakness to strength in only forty or fifty years. Therefore, in China's current environment, it would not be surprising if it took a hundred years to revive. A hundred years may seem long, but it is only a brief "moment" in history. As the ancients said, "a hundred-year plan" and "a hundred-year cultivation of people" show that the short-sighted are not fit to plan for national affairs. As long as we have faith, work hard courageously, build on the past, and continue tirelessly, we will eventually achieve national construction and revival. The recent victory in Suiyuan in suppressing bandits and resisting foreign aggression is only the starting point of national revival. Our nation's glorious future is truly boundless. Even though our national leader may temporarily lose his freedom due to the rebellion of traitorous generals, we have long believed that revolutionary leaders will ultimately succeed, and counter-revolutionary traitors will ultimately fail. Chen Jiongming's betrayal of the Premier serves as a warning. Therefore, under the leadership of a great leader, China will surely revive, and in the process of revival, it will surely regain its lost authority and recover its lost territories.

I have pointed out the reasons why China will never perish and cited various facts to prove it. If those who read my article become optimistic and indulge in pleasure and comfort, they are making the same mistake as those who read "On China's Certain Perishability" and become pessimistic and despondent, thus hastening its demise. We should embrace optimism about the future of our country and establish confidence in China's non-perishability. However, in the midst of optimism and confidence, we must work on national construction and revival with excitement, tension, caution, and fear. This point is extremely important. In his essay "Reflections on My Fiftieth Birthday," Chairman Chiang said, "There is no harvest without labor, nor is there cultivation without gain. Only by consistently applying sincerity and making continuous efforts can any difficulty be overcome." He also said, "Given the long history and culture of our nation, if we do not perish ourselves, who can cause us to perish? If our compatriots all have a sense of shame for not being as good as others and work diligently morning and night with the determination to wipe out humiliation and strengthen the nation, persevering until even metal and stone can be engraved." May our compatriots reflect on these words and put them into practice, then China will not only not perish, but the foundation for its rise and strength will be laid here. (The End)

### Most Banks in the City Expand Business This Year After Reopening Yesterday

The Four Banks' Jiangsu Trust Department and Others Opened Yesterday; All Banks Had Profits, with the Bank of China Leading

After the New Year's holiday, the money houses reopened the day before yesterday, and all banks in the city reopened yesterday morning. Their new business policy is to expand business, such as setting up branches, establishing trust departments, and attracting deposits. The Bank Preparatory Committee, the Bank Clearing House, and the Bank Acceptance House simultaneously resumed operations and continued to exchange and accept as usual.

The Four Banks' Jiangsu Trust Department Opens

① The Four Banks' Trust Department and the Four Banks' Savings Association are located in the same place and started operating yesterday. Its main businesses are various fixed-term and current deposits, real estate sales, professional leasing and construction, company establishment, reorganization, liquidation and issuance of stocks, trading, interest payment and registration of securities, agency collection and remittance, management, insurance, and agency underwriting of various insurances, execution of wills and management of estates, sealed and unsealed storage, and rental of safe deposit boxes, warehouse business, and other special trust services. In addition, the warehouse real estate and custody businesses formerly operated by the Savings Association have been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Trust Department. ② The Jiangsu Bank Trust Department was established with a capital of 200,000 yuan from the head office, with independent accounting. The directors, supervisors, and general manager bear joint and several unlimited liability. It opened yesterday. In order to promote trust and encourage interest, all those who deposit 100 yuan in ordinary trust deposits or pay trust fees of 10 yuan within three months of the opening date will be given a safe deposit box. More will be given proportionally.

The Bank of Communications Offers Two Types of Savings

Starting this year, the Bank of Communications will offer group savings and education savings. ① Group Savings: Any factory, business, or other legal organization that deducts savings from the salaries of its employees each month may, with the consent of the bank, establish a group savings deposit. Each group must have at least 20 people, and the amount deposited by each person each month must not be less than one yuan, but the total amount of principal deposited by each person shall not exceed 20,000 yuan. The term shall be from two to fifteen years, and the interest rate shall depend on the term of the deposit. ② Education Savings: (Type A) Deposit an equal amount each month from the start date of the deposit until one month before the first tuition payment is due for the scheduled course of study. After that, pay tuition fees on a regular basis until the scheduled course of study is completed, at which time the principal and interest of the deposit will be paid off. (Type B) Deposit an equal balance each month from the start date of the deposit until one month before the last tuition payment is due for the scheduled course of study. When the last tuition payment is due, the principal and interest of the deposit will be paid off. Because the number of payments for this type of deposit is greater than that of Type A, the amount that should be deposited each month is also less, so as to reduce the burden on the depositor, which is very suitable for general depositors. (Type C) Deposit the money at one time when opening the account and pay tuition fees on a regular basis until the last tuition payment is due for the scheduled course of study, at which time the principal and interest of the deposit will be paid off. This type of deposit is the simplest and is especially suitable for those with affluent families.

New Policies After the Banks Close Their Accounts

① The Siming Bank opened a Nanjing Road branch and a Ximen branch yesterday, which are located in the same place as the Siming Savings Association. ② The Asia Bank opened a Avenue Joffre branch yesterday. ③ The Tongyuan Bank moved to its new location at the corner of Beijing Road and Henan Road yesterday and is operating as usual. When the branches of the above three banks opened, financial leaders in Shanghai all went to congratulate them. The new location of the Jing'an Temple Road branch of the Bank of Communications has been completed and will soon open. A Xin Sheng She reporter met with Secretary-General Lin of the Bankers Association yesterday. According to him, the operating conditions of the banks in the 25th year of the Republic were good due to the implementation of the new currency system and the vitality of various industries. In addition, it was a year of good harvests in rural areas, so all banks were able to make profits, which will be reported by each bank to the association for compilation and publication. As for the Central Bank's profits last year, it is said to be more than 9 million yuan, which is the highest among all banks.

### The Bank of Communications Allocates 2.5 Million Yuan to Handle Loan for Tea Industry in Anhui and Jiangxi

Agreement Has Been Reached with the Two Provincial Governments at a Monthly Interest Rate of Eight Percent; The Contract Will Be Signed After the Review of the Plan is Completed

According to Xin Sheng She, the governments of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces have requested a loan from the Bank of Communications to handle the unified control of black tea transportation and sales. Wu Linbai, a member of the bank, went to Anhui and Jiangxi to negotiate the loan method with the two provincial governments. He returned to Shanghai at the end of last month. It is said that the total loan amount agreed upon is 2.5 million yuan in national currency, with an interest rate of eight percent per month. The loan will be provided by the bank to the unified black tea institutions of the two provinces, and then the black tea institutions will lend it to tea farmers and tea merchants. The two provincial governments will guarantee repayment. The purposes are: ① to revitalize the tea industry; ② to relieve rural areas. Now the Bank of Communications is conducting a detailed review of the plan of the two provinces to control black tea loans to tea farmers and tea merchants. It has decided to sign a loan contract with the two provincial governments after the review is completed. It is yet to be decided whether the loan will be jointly handled by various banks or by the Bank of Communications alone. The approximate date of the loan is expected to be between March and April.

### The Local Association Held a New Year Tea Party Yesterday

The President Gave a Speech to Welcome New Members; Wang Zhengting, Xiong Shiyi, and Others Gave Speeches

The Shanghai Local Association held a New Year's tea party at its clubhouse in the Zhonghui Building at 5 pm yesterday. At the entrance of the venue, there was a colorful banner with the words "New Year Tea Party." Inside the venue, potted flowers were arranged and wrapped with ribbons, which was very simple. Those who attended included Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting, writer Xiong Shiyi, President Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, members Huang Renzhi, Ren Jinpin, Wang Kui Sheng, Mu Ouchu, Xiang Yuancun, Xu Caicheng, Chen Jicheng, Li Zushen, Wu Kaisheng, Zhu Shaoping, Chen Guangfu, Hu Yunqiu Hu Yunzhuang, Li Yiqiu, Yang Zhixiong, Zhao Jinqing, Gui Yanfang, Luo Youxuan, Qin Runqing, Pan Yangyao, Yang Weiyu, Lu Bohong, Zhang Yixu, Qu Yue, Tao Leqin, Ren Jisheng, Jin Runxiang, Zhou Bangjun, Xu Yongzuo, Wei Wenhan, Wang Boyuan, Wang Boqi, Yu Yefeng, Pan Zhiwen, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Zhixin, Pang Jingzhou, Feng Bingnan (on behalf of Huang Renzhi), Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, He Dekui, Li Zuqi, Yan Fuqing, Lin Kanghou, Xu Xinliu, and Zhu Xuefan, Lu Jingshi.

President's Speech

President Du Yuesheng gave a opening speech saying, "Today is the New Year's tea party. I wish you all progress in the New Year. Looking back on the past year, the Guangdong-Guangxi issue, the Xi'an Incident, and various diplomatic issues have all caused shock and anxiety to the people of the country. However, the results have all been peaceful. This is all due to the leadership of our leaders and government officials and the support and assistance of the people of the country. We must unite sincerely to complete the great cause of national rejuvenation." He then introduced new members, and the audience applauded enthusiastically.

Ambassador's Speech

Ambassador Wang Zhengting said, "President Du, members, today I met Mr. Xin of the Bank of Communications, who mentioned that our association is holding a New Year's tea party this afternoon. I have attended this association several times, and I am very happy to be able to attend again this year. I wish you all a happy New Year and the association a bright future. I always think that politics has the most contact with the people, but the central government has less contact with the citizens than the local government. Because any municipal facility, such as cleanliness, safety, and roads, is as closely related to the citizens as the air they breathe. Therefore, the Premier's political proposition is based on local autonomy, because the relationship between the city and the citizens and the county and the county residents is very important. In the past, our country's politics was laissez-faire. The people and the government had no other relationship except for taxes. The county magistrate only knew how to collect taxes and did not care about local facilities such as water conservancy and hygiene. Because local construction requires money, which means adding taxes, the people will oppose it, and the county magistrate will not be able to stay in his position, be promoted, and become wealthy. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, we have started local undertakings, and the national government has made great progress in municipal administration in places such as Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Recently, I went to Ningbo, and the means of transportation by sea and air can be said to have been fully utilized. I traveled thousands of miles in only three days, which used to take more than ten days. This is the progress of construction. However, to build well, we must have money, which means adding donations and taxes. However, we must ensure that citizens live and work in peace, cultivate citizens' productivity, not kill the goose to get the eggs, increase citizens' knowledge, and make finances open and transparent, without waste or misappropriation. We must take from the citizens and use for the citizens. Now I would like to offer a few more points to this association: ① Pay annual membership fees; ② Expand membership, the more the better; ③ The organization should be divided into categories to study various local events; ④ The association should lead the citizens and assist in the progress of municipal administration, which will surely make great progress. If China has two thousand local associations, the revival of China can be achieved immediately."

Mr. Xiong's Report

Then Xiong Shiyi reported on promoting Chinese art and culture in Europe and the United States, saying, "I went abroad to promote our country's culture and explain various misunderstandings. Foreigners who do not understand the current situation in China still use bound feet, opium smoking, pigtails, and knives to describe the Chinese people, which is really ridiculous. I wrote a play called 'Wang Baochuan,' which was ridiculed in London. They thought I was young and small, and the things I wrote must be unreliable. Theater bookstores did not welcome it. It wasn't until a year and a half later that my book was published, and the sales were good. It is now in its sixth edition, and the reviews from all sides are also good. Later, when it was performed, it was greatly appreciated by the people of that country. It has now been performed more than 830 times. The most number of times a drama in the world has been performed is only more than 600 times. Now various countries have translated and performed it. In the United States, some people even regard me as the Shakespeare of China, and the newspapers have given it great publicity. I am fortunate to have achieved considerable success. When I came back from abroad, I had some thoughts, that is, if we want to promote the national glory overseas, we should use the power of the whole country to promote it. Personal words and deeds must be especially cautious, and we must have an in-depth study of foreign languages. I deeply feel this because my knowledge is not enough. I am very grateful for the hospitality of your association today." Finally, Qian Xinzhi reported on visiting Chairman Chiang in Beijing to express his condolences and on the association's affairs.

### Ding Shaoji Went to Beijing Yesterday

Returned to Shanghai from Japan the Day Before Yesterday

Ding Shaoji, a consultant of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was sent to Japan last year to visit Xu Shiying, our country's ambassador to Japan, to report on the domestic situation. He completed his mission and arrived in Shanghai by ship from Japan on the 4th, and took an early express train from Shanghai to Beijing at 8 am yesterday. Zhou Jue, director of the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others went to the station to see him off.

### National Financial Situation in the 25th Year of the Republic

The National Budget is Determined and the Financial Foundation is Consolidated; People Have More Faith in Legal Tender than in Hard Currency; The Private Economy is Active

A reporter from Xin Xin She visited a certain official of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Shanghai yesterday morning to inquire about the financial situation in the 25th year of the Republic. According to the official, the two major aspects of finance in the 25th year of the Republic were very good. Regarding finance, since Guangdong and Guangxi were pacified and the country was unified, the previous situations of various provinces intercepting national taxes and various financial divisions were completely eliminated. National finance is now under the overall planning and control of the central government. The national budget has been determined, and the financial foundation has been gradually consolidated. Regarding finance, since the implementation of legal tender, due to the consolidation of reserves, the credibility has become better and better. People have more faith in legal tender than in silver coins, and the demand has increased. The private economy has gradually become active, reversing the previous state of stagnation. In recent months, the prosperity of domestic material needs and the development of commerce are sufficient to show the transformation and relaxation of the national economy. Even during this time of the Shaanxi Incident, when the country was facing such a serious situation, the entire financial system has not shown any signs of panic or disorder. The stability of the foundation proves the strong faith of the people in the government. Therefore, under the leadership of the government, the people of the country will work together to struggle, not only will finance have unlimited development, but the country and nation will also become stronger and stronger.

### Sanbei Company Launches Yangtze River Express Service

The Longxing Steamer Sets Sail on the 9th; It Can Reach Hankou in 43 Hours; Regular Invitations to All Sectors to Visit

Yu Qiaqing, the owner of Sanbei Steamship Company, has always had great ambitions in developing the shipping industry. The company's business was quite developed last year, so it proposed to use part of the profits to purchase new ships to replenish the Yangtze River and coastal routes. The Chongxing and Long'an ships have already arrived in Shanghai. The Longxing was originally the Longshan of the Hong Kong and Macau Steamboat Company, built in 1923. The ship's steel plates and machinery engines are all new and strong. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, it was immediately put into the Sanbei factory for renovation and reconstruction of passenger cabins. The interior decoration of the ship focuses on beauty and cleanliness. Now the installation has been completed. It is scheduled to be parked at Pier No. 2 in the South City from 2 pm to 4 pm this Saturday (the 9th) to invite all sectors of Shanghai to board the ship for a visit. The ship is 306 feet and 6 inches long, 54 feet and 1 inch wide, and 13 feet and 6 inches deep, with a total tonnage of 3,068 tons and a registered net tonnage of 1,897 tons. It can load 2,850 tons of goods, and the cabins can hold 63,000 cubic feet. The empty ship has a draft of 7 feet 2 and a quarter inches. The engine is a triple-expansion type with 200 pounds of water and 424 horsepower, and it can travel 15 and a tenth nautical miles per hour. There are three decks, and there are many good cabins. Since it was renovated in the factory, it has become even more beautiful. The ship has five classes: first-class rooms (i.e., the grand dining room) for 40 people, super-class rooms for 30 rooms that can accommodate 64 people, second-class rooms for 56 people, third-class rooms for 198 people, and fourth-class rooms for 1,000 people. It is an excellent ship in the current Yangtze River. The company has realized that the Hubei Provincial Government had proposed to transform the Emei steamer of the China Merchants Bureau to operate a Beijing-Hankou express train to transport passengers in conjunction with railway passengers from all over the country. After the Emei accident, this proposal was shelved, and the Yangtze River express steamer was not realized. Yu resolutely decided to launch this ship as the Yangtze River Express, using its speed to shorten the voyage between Shanghai and Hankou. According to the six companies, Yangtze River steamers from Shanghai to Hankou take up to 90 hours to 96 hours. Now the Longxing is scheduled to go from Shanghai to Hankou, passing through Jing, Wu, Wan, and Xun, all of which stop, and only takes 43 hours. The downstream class from Hankou to Shanghai only takes 40 hours. It can be compared to the capital express and become a good story. The first class is scheduled to leave Shanghai at midnight this Saturday, leave Nanjing at 4:30 pm on Sunday, leave Wuhu at 8:06 pm, leave Anqing at 5:12 am on Monday, and leave Jiujiang at 2:36 pm on the same day. Arrive in Hankou at midnight. It only takes two days from departure to arrival in Hankou. It still takes five hours to stop at various ports. Because it has to rush for time, it does not stop at Zhenjiang. Only passengers are picked up at Wuhu and Anqing, and no cargo is loaded. The company created this express ship entirely to facilitate the travel of passengers between various ports in Beijing and Hankou. It has agreed with the two railway bureaus to handle the connection of passengers on the capital express train and the special express train. Passengers taking the express train to Beijing at 8 am or 9 am on Sunday can take the Longxing in Beijing and arrive in Hankou safely the next night. From then on, Yangtze River passengers between Beijing and Hankou or between Shanghai and Hankou can reduce the one-way trip by two days, or four days up and down, and the fares are also very cheap: 20 yuan for super-class cabins from Shanghai to Hankou, 11 yuan for second class, 5 yuan for third class, and 3.5 yuan for fourth class. The grand dining room is extremely spacious and beautiful, and there is a private bathroom for passengers. The ship leaves Hankou every Wednesday evening and arrives in Shanghai at 2 pm on Friday. The new Long'an ship has a total tonnage of 1,681 tons and a net tonnage of 1,047 tons (can load 1,580 tons of goods, the cabins can hold 55,000 cubic feet, the ship is 284 feet long, 30 feet and 1 inch wide, and 12 feet and 7 inches deep. The empty ship has a draft of 7 feet and 2 inches. The speed of the ship is lower, traveling at 11 nautical miles per hour. Now it is also being renovated in the factory, and it will be out of the dock soon and will sail on the Yangtze River. Both ships have been changed to the Chinese flag.

### The Revenue of the Jiangnan Railway's Nanjing-Wuhu Section Increased Sharply in the Second Half of Last Year

The Previous Rumor That It Would Be Purchased by the Ministry of Railways Was Incorrect

According to the Central News Agency, since the privately-run Jiangnan Railway's Nanjing-Wuhu section was connected to the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, freight transportation has been expanded and the economy of Jiangsu has developed. In addition, due to the bumper harvest of Anhui rice last year, the operating revenue has increased dramatically since September, more than doubling compared to before. Although the company has a large debt, it has managed to save money diligently. Therefore, in addition to paying off debt interest and official stock interest, it has already distributed dividends. The reporter met with Zhou Junmei, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the company, yesterday, and he provided a detailed account of the railway's situation, which is recorded below:

The Process of Establishment

The Jiangnan Railway Company originally planned to build the Wuhu-Zhapu Railway. The first section, from Wuhu to Sunjiabu, was completed and opened to traffic in May of the 23rd year. Subsequently, the plan was changed, and it was reported to the Ministry of Railways to be changed to the Nanjing-Shao Line, with operating rights for 30 years. The Nanjing-Wuhu section was built first. Construction took a year, and it was opened to traffic in May of the following year. The entire line is 176 kilometers long and cost 6.9 million yuan, an average of about 38,000 yuan per kilometer. Its low cost is unmatched by state-owned railways. Last spring, the connecting line between the Zhonghuamen Station of the railway and the Yaohuamen Station of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway was completed, and joint transportation was carried out, with direct passenger trains running, which was convenient for travelers. The section below Sunjiabu has been temporarily delayed due to the company's financial resources. Recently, the Ministry of Railways was ordered to build the Nanjing-Ganzhou Railway, which runs from Sunjiabu through Shexian, Qimen, Fuliang (Jingdezhen) to Guixi in Jiangxi Province, connecting with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Construction has now begun. The flat line is 500 kilometers long and requires a cost of about 40 million yuan. Public bonds have been issued, and funds are being prepared from various banks and the British Boxer Indemnity Board. It is expected that it can be completed by the end of this year. Previous reports stated that the Ministry of Railways would purchase the Nanjing-Wuhu section after the line was opened to traffic. According to Zhou Jun, there have been no such negotiations. The external rumors are said to be speculation.

Business Overview

According to Zhou Jun, the operating revenue of the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway increased sharply last year. It was 113,084 yuan in September, 140,163 yuan in October, 150,143 yuan in November, and 158,372 yuan in December. The total passenger transportation was 1,495,618 people, and the freight transportation was 182,944 tons, more than double the entire year of the 24th year. Since July, the monthly profit has been about 60,000 yuan. More than half of the passengers on the railway are farmers, and almost all of its freight is agricultural products. Therefore, its business is mainly aimed at serving farmers and regulating agricultural production. For example, it is responsible for the transportation of goods in accordance with the orders of the Ministry. It also provides services to farmers such as introducing markets, providing supplies, and reporting grain prices in various places. In order to improve agricultural production in various places along the line, it has jointly established an experimental field with the Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute of the Ministry of Industry. The general office has been established in Yicheng, and there are currently 5,000 mu of farmland. Demonstration fields will be established at various stations year by year to promote improved seeds, which can be spread throughout the entire line in three years. It is also learned that the railway currently has more than 150 freight cars. Due to the congestion of freight transportation, it gradually feels insufficient and is proceeding with the purchase of additional cars.

### Citizens' Association Petitions the Ministry of Finance to Extend the Repayment Period of Loans

Affected by the Current Situation, Please Extend for One Year

The Citizens' United Association of the First Special District petitioned the Ministry of Finance yesterday morning, stating that the market is depressed, and the industrial and commercial loans due should be extended for one year in consideration of the difficulties. The establishment of the Capital City Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee aims to regulate finance and relieve the market. Since its establishment, industry and commerce have relied on it to maintain, and its effectiveness has been remarkable. The association previously submitted a petition to the Ministry on November 17, stating that the citizens' economy had not fully recovered, requesting that the loan review committee be extended for one year to end. Subsequently, the Ministry issued a reply, Qian Zi No. 11516, stating that small industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai needed to borrow money, and those who met the loan qualifications had mostly borrowed it, and the market was gradually improving. It has ordered the cessation of loans in the case. After receiving the approval, the association immediately notified them separately. Recently, it was reported by the 10th District Branch of Hongri that the commercial firms and factories in the Hongkou District that had previously obtained credit loans are now due, and they could have been repaid on schedule. However, they have been greatly affected by the repeated demonstrations of the Japanese army, and they all want to request an extension of the repayment period for one year to maintain the status quo. Since the Bao Le'an Road and Haining Road incidents occurred in the city, the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai has armed outposts and patrols across the border, creating a state of terror and tension, which has hit all industries and commerce, and the Hongkou District has suffered even more damage. The request to extend the repayment of the due loans for one year is indeed true. It is reasonable to report the situation for review and approval, and to consider the suffering of industry and commerce and allow implementation, which is convenient for the public. Respectfully submitted.

### A Large Amount of Dried Cocoons Were Loaded on Ships for Export When Silk Factories Ran Out of Raw Materials

The Trade Association Held an Emergency Meeting to Investigate That They Were Shipped to France, Switzerland, and Other Countries

When silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were running out of raw materials and were planning to suspend production, foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson, Swiss Liner, and Italian Dafa suddenly shipped dried cocoons for export. The silk factory trade association held an emergency meeting, in addition to trying to investigate the details, it also asked the government to stop it. The details are as follows:

Raw Materials Run Out, Factories Shut Down

After the export of Chinese silk became smooth, silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhejiang and other places started to reel silk. In Shanghai, there were a total of 48 factories, including Hengcang and others. However, due to the poor harvests of summer and autumn cocoons, the raw materials of the silk factories ran out, and 29 factories in Shanghai, including Shaoxing Yuanji, and other were forced to suspend production. Those who struggled to maintain production are expected to be completely shut down before the end of the old lunar year, and they must wait for the spring cocoons to be on the market this year before they can find a way to start production again.

Jardine Matheson and Other Firms Export Cocoons

At a time when various silk factories were forced to suspend production due to the depletion of raw materials, British Jardine Matheson, Swiss Liner, Italian Dafa and other foreign firms suddenly purchased the best cocoons in China and declared them for export to Italy, Switzerland, France and other places. The purchase price was especially high. For example, the price of high-quality cocoons with a reeling yield of 350 catties was about 250 yuan in national currency per dan of dry cocoons. It is heard that more than 1,000 dan of dried cocoons have been declared for loading and export.

Emergency Meeting of the Silk Factory Association

The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association held an emergency meeting at its association on North Shaanxi Road. Chairman Shen Huachen reported that the export of high-quality cocoons by British Jardine Matheson and other foreign firms concerns the export volume of Chinese silk and the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of workers. Please discuss the case together. It was decided on the spot that although the export of cocoons does not violate the ban, it is at a time when the raw materials for improving silkworm cocoons are in short supply. If the cocoons are exported, it will have a great impact on the livelihood of workers. The association should immediately: (1) send a letter to the Jianghai Customs to investigate the number of exports and the tax rate, and (2) petition the municipal government to quickly find a way to stop it, or forward it to the financial authorities to increase the export tax rate.

Varying Rumors About the Reasons for Export

A reporter from New Sound News learned from the silk industry yesterday that the dry cocoons loaded for export by Jardine Matheson, Liner, Dafa and other foreign firms totaled about 1,000 dan. The reasons for this vary: (1) they are transported to Italy to reel high-quality silk with 9 to 11 strands, because Chinese silk machines cannot reel this strand, (2) they are transported to foreign countries for the manufacture of munitions, such as gunpowder, etc., and (3) they are transported to foreign countries for use as industrial raw materials. What is the truth? It is impossible to find out at the moment.

### The Shanghai County Land Administration Bureau Issues Land Ownership Certificates

The Shanghai County Land Administration Bureau has completed the drawing and printing of land ownership certificates and segmented attached maps for the two townships of Beiqiao and Dashu in the third district. They are scheduled to be issued on January 2, 26th year, for a period of two months. Anyone who has registered but has not paid the registration fee should pay an additional registration fee of 2/1000 of the property value in addition to paying the ownership certificate fee. Those who have paid the registration fee do not need to pay again. The fee for each land ownership certificate is stipulated as follows: (1) those with a land value of less than 100 yuan pay 2 jiao, (2) those with a value of 100 yuan or more pay 5 jiao, (3) those with a value of 500 yuan or more pay 1 yuan, (4) those with a value of 1,000 yuan or more pay 2 yuan, (5) those with a value of 5,000 yuan or more pay 5 yuan, (6) those with a value of 10,000 yuan or more pay 10 yuan. If the certificate is collected in the first month after the deadline for issuing the certificate, a storage fee of 1 jiao will be charged for each certificate. If the certificate is collected in the second month, a storage fee of 2 jiao will be charged for each certificate. If the certificate is not collected after the deadline for collecting the storage fee, the owner will be notified to cancel the registration, and the Land Administration Bureau will temporarily manage it. The above method was announced to the public by the Shanghai County Government the day before yesterday, ordering all households to bring their certificates to the County Land Administration Bureau within the prescribed period to collect them. It is also heard that the land ownership certificate is a professional certificate for people's real estate. In the future, matters such as sale, transfer, or mortgage will be based on the new certificate, and the old one will be invalidated.

### A Large Number of Overseas Chinese Expelled from the Soviet Union Return to China by Ship

Until 1 p.m. yesterday, the fourth boy, Zhang Rongbao, and the shop assistant, Zhang Nan San, and others saw that he had not yet gotten up, but they did not care. They did not expect him to commit suicide. At about 1 p.m., a friend came to visit, knocked on the door but received no response. The door was locked from the inside, making it impossible to open. The shop assistant informed the landlord, a Russian, who broke the glass on the window and looked inside. Only then did he realize that there was a strong smell of gas in the room, which was escaping from the window hole. He discovered that Hua had already died in bed. He then found a way to open the door and go inside to check. The body was already cold. He reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was then sent to the hospital of the Public Works Department on Terrace Road, where an autopsy was performed, pending a request to the Second Special Court today to send personnel for an examination.

### More Than a Thousand Red Pills Smuggled and Seized

Lu Junshan, a patrol officer from the Tangjiawan Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, led a number of patrol officers to conduct inspections and patrols within the territory at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. They saw a man, about 40 years old, carrying a burlap sack on his shoulder. His expression was flustered and suspicious. They immediately ordered him to stop. Upon opening the sack, they found more than a thousand poisonous red pills (Qiu Pai brand) and a Golden Dragon brand rubber bag. He was detained and taken to the Ximen Branch Bureau. Under interrogation, he gave his name as Chen Huiqing, 41 years old, from Jiangbei, residing at No. 131 Tangjiawan, making a living by picking up waste paper from garbage bins. He had recently worked as a substitute worker at No. 183 Tangjiawan for four days. He claimed that he had picked up the poisonous items in the garbage bin the day before yesterday, but he firmly refused to confess further details. As the case concerned a major drug-related crime, the suspect and the evidence were immediately transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Police Headquarters for further investigation.

### Public Bus Robbery

Conductor Overwhelmed and Unable to Resist; All Ticket Money (35 Yuan) Stolen

An English-owned Route 9 public bus was traveling south from the Yangshupu station at about 9:40 p.m. yesterday when two middle-aged men boarded the bus at the Songpan Road intersection. The conductor immediately went forward and asked which station they wanted to go to. Unexpectedly, the two men pulled out pistols and threatened him, forbidding him to make a sound. At the same time, because there were no other passengers on the bus, the conductor was unable to call for help. He had no choice but to let them search him. As a result, all the ticket money, more than 35 yuan, was stolen. When the bus reached the Manzhou Road intersection, the robbers ordered the conductor to open the car door and fled into the darkness. The conductor rushed to the Yangshupu Police Station to report the incident and reported it to the company authorities, requesting an investigation.

### Geographical Experts, the Wheels, Arrive in Shanghai on a Trip Around the World

It is said that Abyssinia is rich in reserves

British Royal Geographical Society personnel, Mr. and Mrs. Wheels, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on a trip around the world. They plan to stay here for a short time. Mrs. Wheels told reporters that they had set out from London by plane, but when they flew near Abyssinia, the plane was forced to land due to mechanical failure. The natives initially thought they were Italians and almost killed them. Fortunately, after explaining, they were sent to the Abyssinian capital, where they stayed for four months. The entire territory of Abyssinia is extremely rich in reserves. If a way can be found to excavate them, the prospects are great. However, the area lacks water sources, making work very difficult. The Wheels will leave for Japan on the 6th to continue their ambitious journey around the world. Mrs. Wheels told reporters at the end that this trip had made her even more determined and believed that people must travel in order to broaden their horizons. Otherwise, they will forever be frogs at the bottom of a well, with limited views.

### Statistics on Traffic Accidents in the French Concession in December

Totaling 254 Cases, Slightly Fewer Than in the Same Month Last Year

### Two Death Row Inmates in the Xuansheng Mine Case Appeal

The Grounds for Appeal are Being Drafted; Expenses are Borne by the Lawyer

Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng, the perpetrators of the assassination of a Japanese in the Xuansheng Mine case, have been sentenced to death by the local court. Their accomplices, Zhao Yunhong and Jin Daoquan, have also been sentenced to 12 and 13 years in prison, respectively. Zhu Guisheng and Chen Siming, who were preparers, were each sentenced to two years in prison. Wang Wangshi, who transported the pistol, was sentenced to two years, and Zhang Mashi was sentenced to one year. Because Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng were sentenced to death, an appointed pro bono lawyer was specially designated to file an appeal on their behalf. The grounds for the appeal are being drafted. It is generally argued that the defendants are ignorant and unknowing. When Li Ruiwu incited them to commit the crime, he claimed it was to avenge his father. The defendants' motive for killing was to avenge a friend, which was a so-called chivalrous act. They were unaware of Li Ruiwu's cunning plan and were wrongly caught in the legal net. Therefore, the reward was very small, and they should be treated with leniency and given a lighter sentence. At the same time, the contradictions and evasions in Mao and Wang's confessions indicate that the one who killed Xuan Sheng with a single bullet should be the perpetrator, while the other was only in a helping position. The sentencing should be clearly differentiated. Therefore, this reason is used as a principle. Once completed, the full text will cite the law and logically support the facts favorable to the defendant and then be submitted to the court. All the costs of the appeal and the defense in Suzhou will be borne by the lawyer. As for the appeals of Zhao Yunhong and Jin Daoquan, it is said that Zhao will not appeal.

### Police Chief's Dereliction of Duty

Removed from Office and Investigated

Chen Zhizhang, the police chief of the Linxiaolu Police Station in Zhabei, privately arrested a suspect outside the station the day before yesterday with the intention of extorting money. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by the station chief, Niu Jingyan, who detained him and reported the situation to the General Bureau for instructions. The General Bureau sent personnel to investigate and found that Police Chief Chen had also abused his position to privately protect opium dens and gambling houses and accepted bribes. This was considered truly abhorrent. The Bureau Chief approved an order yesterday to dismiss him from his post and severely punish him.

### Police Gun Robbed

Police Officer Also Wounded by Bullet

At around 10:30 p.m. last night, Wang Fenlou (34 years old, from Tianjin), a petitioning police officer No. 8815 of the Huining Road Huairenli in the Nanshi, was on duty at the entrance of the lane when four robbers wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers with Jiangbei accents suddenly jumped out of the darkness next to Police Officer Wang. Two robbers held pistols. One robber hugged the police officer tightly from behind, and the other two robbers pulled out pistols and forced him not to shout. The police officer lost his ability to resist. At the same time, one robber robbed the pistol worn by the police officer. The four robbers quickly fled in different directions. The police officer bravely chased after them, but one robber turned around and fired a shot at him, hitting the police officer's left thigh. He immediately fell to the ground. When the Ximen Branch Bureau of the district heard the alarm, it dispatched a large number of senior police officers to rush to the scene. The robbers had already fled far away. The police officer was taken to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by car. The injury was not serious.

### Customs Harbor Master Removes Buoy and Facilitates Navigation of Ships

Tebeek, the Harbor Master of the Jianghai Customs, replied to Xing Zhigang, a representative of the shipping industry east and west of the Huangpu River, yesterday to allow the cleaning up of the waterway for civilian ships entering and leaving the South Shanghai area. The letter stated: "I have received your representative's letter stating that the waterways for entering and leaving the public wharves south of Dongjiadu have been blocked by the sand boats tied to the buoys set up by this Customs, making it impossible to pass through. It is requested that one of the buoys between the Nanhuiguan public wharves be removed first to facilitate the entry and exit of civilian ships and avoid detours that cause accidents. After investigation, I would like to invite your representative to come to this department to discuss the matter so that the entry and exit of both civilian and sand boats will not be hindered. I am sending this letter to you for your information." Representative Xing personally visited Harbor Master Mr. Tebeek and requested that one buoy be removed from the south end of the Nanhuiguan shipping wharf and that a group of sand boats be relocated. This has been publicly announced and implemented, leaving a 250-foot gap to facilitate the entry and exit of civilian ships. If it is found that sand boats are mistakenly parked in the gap and blocking traffic, they will be subject to detention and fines by the Customs patrol boat to maintain traffic.

### Bandits Active in Winter, Major Robbery Case at Leather Goods Store in Nanshi; Police Step Up Precautions

Bandits Secretly Plot Illegal Activities in Small Teahouse; Detectives Rush to Arrest and Investigate Robbery Case

With the arrival of winter, it is a time when bandits are actively moving. Although the police stations have stepped up their precautions, robbery cases have still occurred from time to time recently. After the Liu Jingde counting house robbery case on Beijing Road, the public concession police authorities have increased their precautions and ordered Chinese and Western detectives to secretly investigate bandit tracks to ensure the safety of the residents. Wang Shusen, the Chinese detective chief, and Song Ziqing, a detective of the Old Gate Police Station, suddenly learned at 8:20 p.m. last night that a number of bandits were gathering in a small teahouse at No. 5 Xi'an Road, planning to set out to rob. They immediately rushed to arrest them. Two men from Jiangbei, Du Hongsheng and Qiu Fuzi from Yangzhou, were arrested in the teahouse, and a fake pistol was seized. They were taken back to the police station. Under questioning, they learned that they were planning to rob the property of the Wantai Coal Company at No. 145 Wusong Road. The idea was actually conceived by He Asan, the clerk of the coal company, because he knew that the company had a large amount of cash stored every day, so he invited Du, Qiu, and others to carry out the robbery. The detectives immediately rushed to He's residence at No. 73, Lane 21, Huaji Road, and arrested He. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Special District Court. Ru Baoyi, the police lawyer, explained the situation and requested permission for detention, stating that the case still required the continued arrest of accomplices and investigation of the crime. Under the interrogation of the three defendants by Qian Hongye, the criminal court judge, the three defendants were ordered to be remanded in custody and the hearing was rescheduled for a week later.

### Heavy Robbery Case at Leather Goods Store in Nanshi; Male and Female Robbers Sentenced

Wang Chen Shi is the Main Receiver of Stolen Goods; Sentenced Separately from the Male Robbers

At about 6 a.m. on the 20th of last month, several robbers broke into the Qianfeng Leather Goods Store at No. 140 Limaj Road in Nanshi, robbing 2,131 yellow weasel pelts worth more than 10,000 yuan, more than 450 yuan in banknotes, a woolen coat, leather shoes, pens, and other items, and fled. The case was reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, but no arrests were made. Recently, Bai Mingfu, Wang Debiao, and Tang Guangfu, detectives of the Hongkou Police Station, arrested the receiver of stolen goods, Wang Linsheng from Pudong, his mistress Wang Chen Shi, and suspects Wang Jinbao, Chen Ye Shi, and Wang Tao Shi, and others at No. 393 Mahuo Road and the Oriental Hotel. 2,191 original stolen yellow weasel pelts were seized and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefei presided over the interrogation in Criminal Court No. 3. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, stated that it had been determined that Wang Jinbao was not involved in the case and requested that he be released first. The court granted the request and stated that it was now filing a public prosecution for receiving stolen goods under Article 349, Sections 2 of the Criminal Law. It was also stated that the stolen yellow weasel pelts were transported to No. 393 Mahuo Road by Zhu A Mao and Wang A Mao, who are at large, and then entrusted to a person to sell to Shuangtian Yiqin, a Japanese national of the Liming Trading Company, No. 18 Haining Road, for 1.5 yuan per pair. The Japanese national then resold them to the Hailisi Trading Company, No. 261 Jiangxi Road, but by this time the case had been solved. Wang Chen Shi is the main receiver of the stolen goods in this case. She is familiar with Zhu A Mao, who is at large, so she stored the stolen goods. Subsequently, Yu Zhijing, the manager of Qianfeng Leather Goods Store, testified about the robbery and requested that the stolen goods be returned. Judge Xiao questioned the defendants and obtained clear confessions. Wang Linsheng was sentenced to six months in prison, Wang Chen Shi to one year and six months, and Chen Ye Shi and Sheng Tao Shi were acquitted and released. The stolen goods were returned to their original owner.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and Two Highways Revise Intermodal Timetable

Can Connect with Xiaoshao and Shao Cao Gao Highways

The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has revised the operating hours of the passenger trains for the convenience of passengers. The revision will take effect on January 1, 1937. However, the 11th Express Train of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway arrives at Nanxingqiao Station at 12:43 p.m., making it too late to board the intermodal buses of the Pushao Highway and the Shao Cao Gao Highway. After consultation with the two highways, the Railway Administration has revised the intermodal bus schedule of the two highways, starting from January 1, 1937, to facilitate the transfer from the 11th Express Train of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to the Pushao Highway bus upon arrival at Nanxingqiao Station. At Wuyun Station, passengers can transfer to the Shao Cao Gao Highway bus and go directly to Caoejiang Station. At Caoejiang Station, passengers can take the Hangzhou-Ningbo section bus to Yinxian.

It is also learned that the editor of the Shanghai Hanxue Weekly, who has a good friendship with Mr. Xiong, has agreed with him to ask Mr. Xiong to write an article on his impressions of returning to China and submit it to the publication for publication.

### Lv Yuequan Goes to Guangdong and Nanyang to Inspect Life Insurance Business

Mr. Lv Yuequan, the General Manager of the Huaan Cooperative Life Insurance Company, took the Lapudana steamer to Guangdong yesterday. The company's Guangdong branch has built its own new building in Guangzhou, which has been completed. Therefore, Mr. Lv is going to preside over the opening ceremony and, after completing the event, will take the opportunity to go to Batavia and Medan in the Dutch East Indies of Nanyang to inspect the life insurance business. The company established branches in the above-mentioned Nanyang locations more than ten years ago. Overseas Chinese are extremely enthusiastic about taking out life insurance. The company is a purely Chinese-funded organization, well-managed, and has an excellent reputation. In addition, overseas Chinese are known for their patriotic enthusiasm, so they all choose to take out life insurance with the company. Mr. Lv's visit to Nanyang to inspect the business will surely give the overseas Chinese an even better impression.

### Grand Occasion of the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings by Modern Masters

The Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings by Modern Masters, organized by the Xinhua Art College in this city, opened on the 2nd at the New World Department Store on Nanjing Road. Yesterday was the fourth day. Although the weather was cloudy, Chinese and Western visitors continued to come in droves. Since the funds from the purchase of the paintings in the exhibition will be used as a fund for the construction of the school's art museum, the prices are low, and orders are very enthusiastic. It is heard that the exhibition will last until the 12th. It is necessary for Chinese people who love art and sympathize with this cause to take a look.

### Japanese Nationals Tease Chinese Umbrella Vendor

According to a translation from the "North China Daily News" (字林報) by the "Outer Discussion Society" (外論社), on Sunday (the 3rd), two Japanese nationals got into an argument with a certain Mr. Jia, an umbrella vendor, on Chengdu Road. They were taken to the Chengdu Road police station by Chinese police officers. The Japanese nationals were subsequently sent to the Japanese Consulate yesterday. Reportedly, the reason for the argument was that the Japanese nationals, being on holiday for the New Year, were strolling along the road and, upon seeing the umbrella vendor carrying his wares, intentionally teased him by reaching out and grabbing two umbrellas. The vendor, upon seeing this, insisted on not giving them up, leading to the argument and then a physical altercation. The vendor was reportedly punched once. At this point, a crowd of onlookers gathered, gradually becoming sympathetic and aligning themselves with the vendor against the Japanese nationals. Fortunately, Chinese police officers arrived and took the two Japanese nationals and the umbrella vendor to the Chengdu Road police station, after which the two Japanese nationals were sent back to the Japanese Consulate.

### Workers of Jardine Matheson Ships Petition the Seamen's Union

Against the Establishment of a Stewards' Office

The aft section workers of the British-owned Jardine Matheson Steamship Company petitioned the Seamen's Union yesterday to oppose the establishment of a stewards' office. The details are as follows:

Background to the Dispute

Jardine Matheson Company has over forty ships operating on the Yangtze River and in northern and southern waters. Each ship has one steward, who hires waiters. In total, there are over three hundred waiters. In the past, the stewards and waiters were part of a joint organization called the "Tong Yi She" (同益社), but it has since been suspended due to conflicting opinions.

Opposition to the Establishment

The aft section workers (i.e., the waiters) were dissatisfied with the stewards colluding with the company to oppress workers, deduct wages, hire their own people, and dismiss workers. Therefore, they obtained approval from the Party branch of the union to establish the "Aft Section Tong Yi She." Recently, the stewards on each ship also requested the Party branch to establish a stewards' office. The aft section workers rose up in opposition.

Demands

Yesterday morning, representatives of the aft sections of various ships, including the Jiahe (嘉和), Hehe (和和), Gonghe (公和), and Fusheng (阜生), went to the Seamen's Union to petition, requesting that: ⑴ The union prevent the stewards from establishing an office; ⑵ The Party branch be requested to refuse to issue a permit. Secretary Wang Jiyi (王寄一), Committee Member Sun Liping (孫履平), and Section Chief Wang Yalen (王雅倫) received them and promised to forward the workers' demands to the special commissioner for handling. The workers were satisfied and then dispersed.

### Murdered Infant Discovered by Danfeng Road in the Southern City

The Court Has Sent Personnel for Inspection - Orders Issued for Burial and Investigation

At approximately 7 AM yesterday, a police officer from Post No. 12 of the Yimiao Police Station in the Southern City was on duty at the entrance of Baojia Lane on Danfeng Road when he suddenly noticed a bamboo basket beside the road, covered with torn cloth. After a long time, no one came to retrieve it, arousing the officer's suspicion. Upon lifting the cloth, he discovered a newborn girl, whose mouth was filled with leather paper, with a knife wound on her left arm and a hemp rope wrapped around her neck several times. She was already dead. The officer immediately reported the incident to the station. The station chief personally inspected the scene and found the name "Zhang Jinhua" (張金華) written on the basket. Because the case involved the murder of an infant and abandonment of the body, he ordered the local headman to report it to the Shanghai Local Court. At 3 PM in the afternoon, a prosecutor dispatched by the court led personnel to inspect the scene. An order was issued for the body to be collected and buried, and for the investigation and apprehension of the perpetrator.

### Yuan Da Securities House Accused of Evading Exchange Tax

Plaintiff Chen Xingzhen Submits Complaint to Court, Requesting Case Be Transferred to Police for Prosecution

Yuan Da Securities House previously bought and sold securities on behalf of Dr. Chen Xingzhen (吳興人), residing at No. 27 Wenzhou Road. Due to accounting disputes, the firm filed a lawsuit against Chen with the First Special District Local Court, seeking to recover over 4,800 yuan in outstanding payments. A preliminary judgment has already been issued, and it is currently under appeal. However, Chen Xingzhen has now hired lawyers Zha Yaoxian (笪耀先) and Lu Shanyu (陸善餘) to accuse Yuan Da House, Zhu Shaoceng (主張紹曾) and the firm's manager, Yang Yuankai (楊元愷), in the First Special Court of deliberately violating the Exchange Law. They claim that the defendants conducted transactions outside the exchange, thereby evading exchange tax and brokerage commissions, engaging in illegal practices, and harming the national treasury. Such lawsuits are rarely seen. Because the complaint contained a request for the prosecutor's office to initiate a public prosecution, Judge Dai Rongduo (戴榮鐸) held a hearing yesterday afternoon, summoning only the plaintiff to court. He questioned the reason why the prosecutor's office could not prosecute, stating that, according to the agreement on the recovery of judicial rights, the prosecutor's office's authority was limited to Chapter 10 of the Criminal Law and therefore could not initiate a public prosecution. He then asked Chen what he meant by requesting in the complaint that the prosecutor's office transfer the case to the police. Chen replied that if the prosecutor's office could not prosecute, then he requested that it be transferred to the police for handling. Chen's lawyers then stated that the plaintiff had already requested the police to handle the case, but they seemed to have little interest and refused to accept it. Although the previous Yongtaihe (永泰和) tax evasion case was prosecuted by the police, the former involved evading tobacco tax, while the current involves evading exchange tax. Although the names are different, the loss to the national treasury is the same. Since the prosecutor's office is limited by the agreement and cannot initiate a public prosecution, it would be more convenient for the office to transfer the case to the police than for the plaintiff to apply to the police directly, and it would certainly not be as fruitless as before. Judge Dai, after the plaintiff clarified his intentions, immediately ordered the plaintiff to submit a request to the prosecutor's office and await their approval.

### All Exchanges in Shanghai Open Yesterday

### Adjournment of the Case of Monk Youming of Mount Putuo Accused of Enticement and Adultery

This case has been ongoing for two years and has been heavily litigated. The final debate was held yesterday, and sentencing will be on the 12th.

Monk Youming, the abbot of the Faru Temple on the back of Mount Putuo, who is over sixty years old, came to Shanghai two years ago to solicit donations. He obtained a large sum of money and resided in the front building of No. 2 Zhaofu Lane, Lafayette Road, in the French Concession. A group of gangsters, including Qiu Zhongyuan, schemed to use a "fairy jump" (仙女跳) and colluded with Wang A'mei (also known as Dai A'wei), a girl from Ningbo who lived in the attic, to force Youming to undress and take photos. Later, they took Youming to the Oriental Hotel and extorted 3,000 yuan, forcing Youming to write a letter of repentance. As a result, Youming wrote a note for 1,000 yuan and was freed. Youming returned to the mountain and reported the incident to the Buddhist Association. The committee reported it to Yingzhao (熒照), the abbot of the temple, who reported it to the French police. Detective Hang Guangfu (杭光福) arrested Qiu Zhongyuan, Wang A'mei, and Wang's mother, Wang Zhangshi (also known as Dai Zhangshi), and brought them to the Second Special Court, where they were prosecuted according to the law. The final judgment was that Qiu was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and fined 400 yuan, and Wang A'mei and Wang Zhangshi were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment. Later, Shao Ruikang, the husband of Wang A'mei (also known as Dai A'wei), first filed a private prosecution against Qiu Zhongyuan, Wang A'mei, and Wang Zhangshi in the criminal division of the Second Special Court for disrupting the family. After hearing the case, the court ruled that it did not meet the requirements for litigation and refused to accept it. Shao Ruikang then submitted a complaint to the criminal division of the Second Special Court, separately suing Monk Youming for disrupting the family. The initial trial resulted in Youming being sentenced to three months of imprisonment. Youming was dissatisfied and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The result of the trial was that the original judgment was overturned, and Youming was acquitted of the crime due to procedural irregularities. Shao was dissatisfied and submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Justice and the Control Yuan. The Third Branch of the High Court was ordered to have Shao submit a complaint to the Second Special Court to file a private prosecution. Judge Zhang Minsheng (張民生) of the Second Special Court opened several hearings for the case. Because the defendant Youming could not be summoned, he was ordered to be arrested and brought to court for questioning. This has been reported in the news several times. Later, Youming learned of the situation in Putuoshan and came to Shanghai with his defense lawyer, Li Ming (李銘), to answer the charges and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. He was ordered to pay a 400-yuan bail bond to await further hearing. Yesterday, the court held another hearing, with both parties bringing their lawyers. After the court questioned the facts, because Wang A'mei and Wang Zhangshi could not be summoned and Qiu Zhongyuan died last year (Qiu's third trial had not yet been judged), the interrogator reviewed the previous case files. Because the facts of the case were clear, he ordered the debate to begin. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the case involved both extortion and adultery. The extortion by Qiu Zhongyuan, etc., occurred because of the defendant's adultery. It can be seen that adultery is the fact and the defendant should be sentenced according to the law. The defendant's lawyer, Li Ming, argued based on legal and factual points. He stated that the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that after a judgment of non-acceptance is finalized, there is no explicit provision for filing another private prosecution, only for requesting a retrial. Furthermore, filing another lawsuit in the same court for a case that has already been privately prosecuted clearly violates litigation procedures. Although the plaintiff's lawsuit is based on the ruling and instructions of the Third Branch of the High Court, it does not state the basis, whether it is a law or a ruling, which cannot legally change the current law. The defendant and Wang A'mei did not actually commit adultery. The original detective can be questioned to clarify that he verified with the second landlord and third tenant where the defendant lived. Furthermore, the original detective arrested Wang A'mei at the Lequn Inn after Qiu Zhongming pointed out that she was a prostitute. The lawsuit filed by the plaintiff accusing the defendant of adultery has no factual basis and is clearly a scheme to extort and harass the defendant. He requested that the defendant be found innocent and that the plaintiff be convicted of false accusation. The court verified the evidence and announced the conclusion, with sentencing scheduled for the 12th.

### U.S. Transport Ship Chaumont Carries American Soldiers Back to the Country Yesterday

The U.S. Navy transport ship Chaumont, which recently ran aground on a beach a few miles from Qinhuangdao in the Bohai Sea for ten days, arrived in Shanghai a week ago. It set sail for San Francisco yesterday afternoon. The ship carried approximately 400 officers and soldiers from the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai and guards from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, as well as some sailors heading south. After a brief stop in Hong Kong, it plans to load approximately 200 more sailors in Manila and return to the country via Guam. Also on board the ship was American youth Hai Caiwei (海才威). Hai entered China from India by land last year, experiencing many hardships. He was imprisoned for several months by Russian officials in Dihua, nearly losing his life. He arrived in Shanghai a few weeks ago and, having lost everything, waited for the ship to arrive in Shanghai to return home, saving on travel expenses. It is reported that after the ship arrives in the United States, the U.S. Navy Department will send personnel to thoroughly investigate who was responsible for the grounding.

### Long-Distance Telephone Development Last Year

Increased Telephone Lines and Improved Call Volume

According to the Telephone Bureau, wired telephone service developed rapidly nationwide last year. Statistics show that the number of completed national telephone networks increased by 104 compared to the previous year. The number of calls increased by 77,775 compared to 1933. There has also been significant progress in the increase of lines. The national line length increased by 18,013 kilometers last year, and the number of line wires increased by 37,531 kilometers. However, because the construction of various lines is not yet fully completed, national calls still need to be improved. If construction continues this year, national calls should be possible by the end of the year.

### Shanghai Neon Light Manufacturing Industry (Continued)

— Compiled by China Credit Information Service

[Shanghai Industry and Commerce Overview, No. 41]

[4] Business Methods and General Conditions

When neon lights were first created, their selling price was quite expensive, but since those who installed them were mostly larger stores and factories, they could still afford it. Therefore, their business method was mostly selling. Later, on the one hand, the installation of neon lights had become widespread to ordinary stores, and on the other hand, due to the impact of the economic downturn, there were more store changes. Therefore, the business method was changed to leasing and installment sales, because this could both reduce the burden on customers and reduce risks.

For those who lease, a contract is usually signed for three years. If there is any damage during the three years, the factory is responsible for free repairs. After the expiration, if the lease is continued, the fee can be reduced by half, and the responsibility for repairs still remains. The rental fee is calculated to be about 30% higher than the selling price, and fees are collected monthly or quarterly, etc. This method is mostly used by smaller factories.

Larger factories, such as Oriental Li'an, mostly sell. Although there are also leases, the number is quite small. The market price is usually calculated by the foot. In the summer of the year before last (the 24th year), the prices were discussed and agreed upon by various peers, and they were divided into two types: lettering and border tubes. The records are as follows: (Unit: Yuan)

[3] Border Tubes – This category refers to various decorative border tubes and drawings, etc. The selling price is calculated by the foot, at six yuan per foot. The minimum length for border tubes is twenty-five feet, and those less than that are also calculated as twenty-five feet.

The above are for the three colors of yellow, green, and blue. If yellow is needed, an additional 40% is added. For double-sided, an additional 80% is added. Other factories also have words such as "Happiness," "Longevity," and "Condolences" for rent. The rental price is calculated based on the size of the word and the rental period. Although the pricing is expensive, it is said that there can be considerable discounts during transactions.

In recent years, the business targets of this industry in this city have been very narrow, and the main ones are new stores. Therefore, whenever a new store opens, there is competition and price cuts to attract customers. It is said that the profits of this industry were quite high in previous years, with some reaching 100% profit, but recently the profits have become increasingly meager. After deducting expenses, some even have losses, which is enough to show the difficulty of operating. (End)

Commercial News

### Yarn Market

Manufacturers released large quantities of consigned yarn, causing the yarn market to feel unsupported. Warehouse order transactions were too active and benefited short sellers. It is expected that the Osaka Three Products market may also decline. The relaxation of the price of raw cotton is a reason for it.

The yarn market was flat in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The situation was weak, which was due to the relaxation of the price of raw cotton. Today, the Osaka Three Products yarn market may fall back. People's minds have eased. Although the sales of spot yarn are particularly active, with buyers from the interior, Guangdong, Tianjin, and other regions eagerly gathering, the general industry opinion is that about 20,000 bales of yarn for the February and March periods have been purchased from various parties in recent days. After this large batch of warehouse orders is placed, it will benefit the short side. In addition, the yarn stored in the warehouse has reached 8,000 bales, of which coarse yarn accounts for half. At the same time, Jardine Matheson Factory, a British company, offered 7,000 to 8,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn.

Yarn prices plummeted by 2.4 yuan this month.

At the opening of the marked yarn market, the momentum of each month was mediocre. Due to bad news, although year-end customer purchases were strong, most of them were future yarn. Moreover, the Osaka Three Products yarn market fell back the previous day. Unexpectedly, at the opening of the second round, except for the January period, which fell back, the other months all jumped sharply by 1.7 to 1.8 yuan. Due to the large-scale purchases of spot yarn by the interior, Guangdong, and Tianjin regions, people's minds were excited, and outsiders dragged in even more, forcing a slight decline at the third closing. As a result, each month rose by 0.4 to 1.2 yuan compared to the previous year's closing price, but the January period alone fell by 0.6 yuan. The market was flat at the opening in the afternoon. After the second round, it turned weak, and selling prevailed again. Due to bad news and the daily decline in raw cotton prices, it is expected that the Osaka Three Products yarn may decline. After the excessive purchases were settled, market prices dropped step by step. As a result, each month fell by 1.8 to 1.9 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Gengfeng sold 1,000 bales, Shenji 800 bales, Hengyi 4,150 bales, Yiji 2,000 bales, Jinchang 1,800 bales, Mingde 1,250 bales, Zhenda 1,400 bales, Daqing 1,100 bales, Hexing 1,750 bales, Ruida 1,100 bales, Fengtai 1,650 bales, Xiecheng 1,100 bales, and Taichang 950 bales. Wang Taixing bought 6,050 bales, Yuan Yi 1,550 bales, Changfeng 4,650 bales, Yuda 4,300 bales, Chengji 900 bales, Tongji 1,050 bales, Daji 1,600 bales, Dachangcheng 1,150 bales, and Fukang 2,700 bales. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.

More than 7,000 bales of yarn were sold in three days.

The sales of spot yarn have improved. It was found that a total of 7,377 bales of future and spot yarn were traded on the previous day (December 31st and the 4th and 5th). The selling price rose by 2 yuan in the morning and by 5 yuan for thread, and fell by 1 yuan in the afternoon and by 2 yuan for thread. The purchase amounts of each region are as follows:

The cotton inventory in this city has increased, and the price of cotton has been falling endlessly. The April supply has already entered the market, and the market price is getting smaller and smaller.

The cotton market is trending weak, and the decline is severe. Since the New Year's market closed, the overseas US and Indian cotton markets have been ordinary. The cotton inventory in this city has increased, so people's minds have relaxed. At the same time, the current factory demand for cotton is not strong, and the market is still trending downward.

The price of cotton plummeted by about 0.7 yuan.

At the opening of the marked cotton market, each month fell in unison, and the market situation was very weak. Because the overseas Indian and US cotton markets were dull and weak during the several days of the New Year's market closure, and the Wanghai cotton inventory also increased, people's minds softened, which was in inverse proportion to the yarn market. The second round recovered slightly, but after the third closing, it entered a state of fatigue. Each month fell by 0.45 to 0.5 yuan compared to the previous year's closing price. The market situation was still weak at the opening in the afternoon. Because the current factory demand for cotton was not smooth and the foreign cotton situation was mediocre, market prices fell step by step. As a result, each month fell by 0.15 to 0.15 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Jifeng sold 3,000 dan, Dafeng 2,800 dan, Heyu 2,400 dan, Taichang 9,400 dan, Yichang 1,900 dan, Yikang 3,700 dan, Xinchang 3,200 dan, Xinxing 2,000 dan, Dachang 1,700 dan, and Hengyi 1,700 dan. Dafu bought 2,500 dan, Juxing 1,800 dan, Mingde 4,200 dan, Hengchang 1,800 dan, Changyu 4,000 dan, Renfeng 6,400 dan, Yuan Yi 1,900 dan, Shengyuan 2,300 dan, and Ruida 1,700 dan. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.

Only fine cotton is traded in the spot cotton market.

The consumption of spot cotton is mediocre, and the factory appetite is not healthy. The source is 2,960 bales of Yao cotton and 2,250 bales of Tong cotton.

American cotton merchants seem to be waiting for something.

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with a sluggish situation. There was a situation of waiting for the government's plans for cotton loans. Because the long positions were being settled and there were sales in New Orleans, each month was unchanged at 7 points. It was the general opinion that the results of the government's plans may not change much. However, before the announcement, no one dared to take any action. Afterwards, the long positions continued to be given up, and market prices softened. At the closing, short positions were covered, and some rebounded. It is estimated that spot prices fell by 9 points, and futures prices fell by 8 to 15 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 3 points, and futures prices fell by 5 to 6 points. At first, Indian cotton had only a few short sales because American cotton loans were not being sold. At the same time, the stock market and wheat market were strong, and market prices rose. Later, they returned due to the settlement of long positions and bad news from Liverpool. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 0.75 to 1.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.75 to 1.35 rupees, and Ziluo Creek rose by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th telegram).

According to a telegram from Mumbai, the forecast for the opening on the 5th is that Ziluo Creek will be 229 rupees, Aomula will be 207 rupees, and Pingguoer will be 178.25 rupees, all down by 1.25 rupees.

Attached are the weekend statistics for American cotton as follows (unit: thousands of bales):

The amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week

According to a telegram from Mumbai on the 4th, only 6 tons of cotton were exported from Rangoon last week, all to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods

The sharp decline in yarn and cotton prices has also caused the cotton cloth market to decline.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was that the transaction of various goods was quite active in the two days before and after the closure. In particular, light-weight coarse cloth and fine cloth, fine twill, printed satin, and colored tribute were more common. The selling price was strong for Dong cloth fine twill and fine cloth because the market was active before the closure. However, the market yesterday was slack due to the unanimous decline in the months of marked yarn and cotton. The cloth market also declined. Dong cloth fine cloth fell back by 5 points per piece. Fine twill prices were still strong due to the scarcity of inventory. However, fine cloth and fine twill from this factory fell by 5 to 7.5 points per piece. The selling price of coarse cloth and coarse twill was generally stable. The selling price of printed goods was also generally stable. The desire for white goods from the local dye factories of the local customer groups was strong. The Ning Shao group purchased more than 100 packages of Jardine Matheson's light-weight coarse cloth. The Hankou group also purchased 40 to 50 packages of Dong cloth fine cloth and fine twill from dye factories, totaling more than 100 pieces, and nearly 200 pieces of coarse cloth for winter dyeing. Customer groups from far away prepared for the end of the lunar year, and fewer goods were added. The Guangdong and Yunnan groups purchased a lot of fine twill and thread fabric at low prices. The selling price was not good, which led to fresh inquiries about new goods.

General situation of the arrival and sales of wool fabrics

Sales

Wool fabrics such as riding breeches, corduroy, chocolate, camel hair, Melton overcoats, plain thick fabrics, and women's colored fabrics are still the most popular. The main buyers are the Western-style clothing and fashion groups on this street, and the hat and shoe groups also purchase actively. Therefore, felt and shoe fabrics, 1.6-foot velvet, etc., are also selling very well and are in a relatively good trend. Black and gray corduroy riding breeches, plain-colored and black and gray Polish overcoats, Camotecs and brown horse sleeve lining, and black charcoal French tail hair are all in short supply. Plaid shoe fabrics priced around 8 yuan are also selling well. Men's and women's clothing stores need plain-colored tribute and khaki fabrics. Due to the cold weather, leather overcoats are in season, which has caused shortages and price increases. Wide and tight camel hair is selling well at the right time, but the price is still the same as last year due to the appropriate supply and demand.

Arrival of goods

Few import declarations were made for the New Year, because the days for selling winter goods are temporarily over, and it is too late to catch up. This was anticipated by people in the industry in advance, so large shipments did not arrive in Shanghai. Although it is said that new goods for spring sales are arriving one after another, the actual amount that has arrived is very small. Because the sales season is still pending, the scheduled shipping dates are all in December. The peak arrival time for official new goods will be at the end of this month and the beginning of next month.

### Food

Rumor has it that manufacturers have ordered foreign wheat. Futures wheat and flour sales suddenly became active. Flour was slightly stronger by three points. Wheat fell by one corner.

Yesterday, in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, each month showed a trend of initial stability and continued decline. The price of foreign wheat changed very little during the several days of market closure, with a difference of about 0.52 yuan in Chicago and 0.1 to 0.2 yuan in Canada. Therefore, people's minds were still stable when the prices were opened. This month opened at 0.26 yuan, then fell slightly by 0.01 yuan. By the time it was auctioned to February, it was rumored that the factory had traded two ships of foreign wheat during the market closure, which caused people's minds to soften and selling to become more prevalent. By the time of closing, each month had fallen back uniformly by about 0.04 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, the price for this month was lowered to 0.2125 yuan. For February and later months, because the factory had not hedged, outsiders were still absorbing, and the market atmosphere returned to stability. However, since the closing of accounts had just passed, and the total closing was approaching again, transactions in each month were not very active.

It has been announced that, starting from the 6th, the margin for each thousand yuan at the flour exchange will be changed to five hundred yuan.

Wheat

Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, each month showed a downward trend at the opening in the morning. Because the price of foreign wheat did not change much during the market closure, and it was widely rumored in the market that local factories had purchased foreign wheat at the end of last year, people's minds were very relaxed, and many longs were returning. Each month was down by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, because there were still more outsiders giving up long positions, the market atmosphere continued to weaken, especially for April, which was even softer and fell by a huge 0.16 yuan. New wheat for June had already been auctioned according to custom. The initial price was 5.6 yuan. By the afternoon, because outsiders were bidding more than they were bidding out, the price rose higher, and it rose by 0.1 yuan compared to the initial price. According to the current distance between the new and old wheat, there may be other entrances in the future. The spot wheat market saw sluggish trading, and prices also turned weak. Shaoxing wheat opened at 6.65 yuan, second-grade wheat at 6.6 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat at 6.7 yuan, with a total of more than 2,000 bales.

The price of He Xia Bai Jing rose in the morning and fell back in the afternoon. There is also a rumor that the Tianjin group is returning the Bo Dao.

[North Shanghai] Yesterday, the sources from various He Xia groups were about forty. The sales appetite for various goods in the market was mediocre. The opening price of Bai Jing in the early market was tight, and the closing price in the afternoon was weak due to sluggish sales. Mo Le turned soft, as did Bo Dao. Due to the shortage of second-grade Bai Jing, the price of Early Dao was tall. Yang Du Bu Jian was still firm. The sales of Ke Jian were not smooth, and the price stood still. The price of Bai Yuan was tightened by several points. The other goods all showed a soft trend.

[South Shanghai] Yesterday, the sources from various groups turned scarce, with a total of more than fifty groups. There were a total of 12,400 to 12,500 shi of goods. Among them, the Bo Dao market had more than 30 groups, and because of the surge the day before, it seemed that there was too much momentum, and it turned dull. It is estimated that the Pingjin, Qingyan, and other groups only handled 1,000 to 2,000 bales, and the situation turned weak. The market price fell back by several points. Depending on the late market trend, it was heard that the customer group had returned the goods after the Tianjin telegram was slightly late, because the market changes seemed to contain a trend of easy decline and difficult rebound. The two markets of thick and thin jing were completely different, because their large varieties were sold exclusively on this street, and the zinnia was still active, so the price increased by another 0.1 yuan. Du Yang Jian followed the high price by 0.1 yuan. Yin Yuan was a seasonal product for the New Year, and the sales were quite extensive. Furthermore, the arrival of goods was limited, and the market color was quite good, and the price rose again by 0.1 yuan.

The Guangdong group is still purchasing customer rice.

Yesterday, the sales of customer rice to local customers were still active. However, because the purchase was too greedy the day before (4th), some local customers were already watching more, and a small number of local landlords were returning with the market, so the market turned back by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. According to the previous day, the local street and landlords handled more than 40,000 bales, and the various customer groups also traded about 30,000. The market price had recovered by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Yesterday, the cargo owners wanted to call a higher price, and the price of the landlords who wanted to sell fell back. However, since the Guangdong group has been suspended in Xiang Province, it has recently paid attention to Shanghai rice. Recently, two rounds have been directly sent to Guangdong, and the purchase appetite is still active. In addition to the more than 20,000 bales handled the day before, more than 16,000 bales were continued yesterday. Therefore, the market for brown rice is still stable. The market for machine-milled rice has turned weak because the local sales have turned weak. The Tong market opened 5,310 bales of Jiangxi rice, 12,345 bales of Xiang rice, 3,700 bales of Han rice, and 2,000 bales of Wenyong rice.

Review of the customer rice market in the 25th year

### Securities

Large and small investors came out one after another, and the decline in public bonds was strong.

Yesterday, the public bond market of the Hua Shang Securities Exchange was opened as usual, and the market situation suddenly showed a decline. Because the market people's minds were quite optimistic about the stability of the current situation at first, the large investors did not move after the market opened, and the transactions were rare. The retail investors were controlled by rumors and suddenly turned panicked, and they came out one after another. The sellers also suddenly saw excitement, and the market price gradually decreased uniformly, which was still called fierce. However, because the Spring Festival period was approaching, the market atmosphere changed from flat to clear and idle. Therefore, the debt market may have a wider range of rotation. The market atmosphere was extremely sluggish at the opening yesterday morning, and the transactions were also reduced. The retail investors sold a lot, and the market price suddenly went downstream by 0.05 to 0.3 yuan. The trend of the second round continued to be weak, and the number 43.10, etc. was still sold in large numbers. The number 11 was bought quite diligently. Except for types Ding and Bing, which rose slightly by 0.05 and 0.1 yuan this month, the rest all decreased by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The market situation was even more depressed at the opening in the afternoon. Because there were rumors of negative news, people's minds were extremely tired. The numbers 5, 10, and 35, etc. were sold very enthusiastically, and the market price fell again by 0.15 to 0.55 yuan. At the closing, types Wu and Ding were sold for 54.10, etc., and the price was reduced by another 0.05 and 0.45 yuan. Starting from type Bing, those who were making up for short positions gradually poured in, and the price rebounded by 0.05 to 0.3 yuan. As a result of the whole day, the uniform decrease was from 0.3 to 0.9 yuan. The total number of transactions was 8,905,000 yuan. The comparison table of the increases and decreases, highs and lows is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):

### Finance

Many long positions were settled in the gold market. The market was initially tired and then stabilized. As a result, it was slightly up by 0.04 yuan.

Yesterday, during the New Year period of the gold market, the price of London raw gold did not change. Many long positions were sold off and the market was tired.

The Dalian group sold off Donghui, and the Japanese banks pulled in to balance the market. The exchange rates between the British and American currencies also remained unchanged.

Although the exchange market was closed by the customer groups, the Japanese banks worked hard to balance the market. The process was still smooth.

### Sugar Market

Sugar prices rose sharply again.

Yesterday, the sugar market situation was tight again. The association drew the market, with the price of No. 24 coarse sand white at 22.1 yuan and the price of re-exported goods at 6.8 yuan, which rose again by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan.

Xinghua Mingjing red opened more than 100 bales with a price of 10.2 yuan to 15.6 to 7 yuan, a sudden increase of 0.5 to 0.6 yuan.

### North-South Goods

The sales of fungus from the North group are very smooth. The selling price of Yixing goods has risen by 5 to 7 yuan.

Fungus is scarce in both arrival and storage recently, and the sales appetite on the North Road is quite active, so the market situation has been rising again and again. For example, Sichuan fungus has been opened to 120 yuan, and Yichang fungus has also reached 102 to 3 yuan, a rise of 5 to 7 yuan. At the same time, the production price in Hankou has also followed up, such as Hekou Xing'an and other goods, which have all reached 100.04 yuan, and Gu fungus also needs 96 to 78 yuan. The price of auxiliary fungus is from 159 yuan to 160 yuan to 161 yuan. A small package of Aviation brand fungus here is selling for 120 yuan, and the second-grade fungus is slightly reduced.

### Silk and Tea

Only Sichuan silk has a slight sale opening.

Yesterday, in the New York silk market, the recent price softened by 0.01 yuan, and the long-term price did not move. The actual sales price was still stable. Lyon was still fixed as before, and Yokohama was still without a market. The various foreign banks in Shanghai's silk market have opened for business as usual, but they are quiet and there are no transactions, because the manufacturers are aware of the stable foreign silk market and the fact that their inventory is insufficient, so they mostly want to sell at high prices, which has caused the New Year's red plate to fail to open. Only a slight amount of Sichuan silk has been sold, and the number is not large. The users need the goods, and they are quite eager, but due to the high prices, transactions are rare. The total number of transactions in the city yesterday was 27 bales.

The black tea in the two lakes is transported and sold outside the customs.

The transactions of red and green tea in this city are still silent due to the New Year's market closure and the shortage of inventory. However, for Gongxi green tea, yesterday the Tianjin and Shandong groups had already handled more than 170 bales from tea shops such as Tongtaixiang Shengtai, and the selling price was from 13 yuan to 15.5 yuan. In addition, foreign banks such as Hejinlong sold more than 5,000 boxes of black tea from the two lakes because they needed it according to overseas telegrams. It is heard that Gaozhuang Zhenceng also has a large amount of exports these days.

### Hardware

American Tinplate Suffering from Source Shortage

Recently, the arrival of American tinplate has been very scarce, and the circulation in the market has gradually decreased. The standard asking price has been rising step by step, with each load increasing by one to two yuan. It has been found that the Hankou merchants shipped thirty to forty loads yesterday, and the local construction merchants also took a small portion. If the supply of goods does not continue, the future market has a good possibility.

New Lead County Suffering from Overwhelming Arrival of Goods

Within the past one or two weeks, the arrival of government-issued lead wire has reached as much as thirteen to fourteen thousand loads. With a large circulation of goods, the outlet is due to the merchants no longer having an intention to import, so the market price has fallen by five cents to one yuan compared to before. For example, from the 16th to the 20th, each load was sold for 13.5 yuan. It is heard that large transactions can be purchased at a market price of 13 yuan.

Random Notes

### Hope

— Cai Qingxin

Hope is like a beautiful young woman dressed in cicada-wing gauze, standing in the distance waiting for us. To get close to her, we need to make an effort.

The golden tower of success is built on the foundation of hardship and difficulty, and the stability of the tower of success is directly proportional to the strength of the foundation. If we want to achieve success, we must build a solid foundation for success. The foundation for success is effort. In the process of effort, we must embrace the spirit of "only ask about cultivating, not asking about the harvest." We should only focus on our efforts and put success or failure aside.

Hoping without effort will inevitably suffer the blow of failure and the pain of disappointment. Conversely, if we only work hard without any utilitarian motives, we may unknowingly climb to the peak of success. For example, Beethoven only knew how to work hard on his music, without thinking about success, let alone becoming a world-famous musician. Millet also only knew how to painstakingly conceive his paintings, and he never dreamed of the success of his great works at the time.

Don't be afraid of failure, and don't be discouraged by disappointment! It's like falling on a rugged road. We must struggle to get up, and with courage, run forward with effort!

### Ethnic Passing-the-Cold Picture

— Wo Fo

It is the season of severe winter again. The poor have barely survived a hot summer, and in an instant, they are facing this cold season again. In terms of life, they must embrace considerable anxiety. But the rich and the leisure class, on the contrary, are welcoming the early arrival of the god of winter because they can enjoy themselves in time and fully enjoy the civilization of material things and the beautiful scenery of the seasons. Moreover, in the process of this enjoyment, they can show their refined taste and attract people's compliments and admiration. Indeed, winter for the rich is just like the height of summer, equally a privileged decoration for them.

For example, if we were to paint a passing-the-cold picture now, we should no longer create the old-fashioned passing-the-cold style of the ancients before the 19th century. Although the surviving depictions of the ancients passing the cold—huddling around the stove, drinking wine, basking in the sun, and talking about poetry—are quite enviable in their leisurely expressions, it is not like this now. There are five- or six-story mansions, scalding hot water pipes, convenient electric stoves. Wearing clothes of the late spring season, one still feels warm to the point of itchy skin. You don’t need to compose poems yourself; there are radio broadcasts of melodious and pleasing songs. If it is snowing heavily and thickly outside, then admiring the coolies like rickshaw pullers toiling in the world decorated with snow and jade, turning over blocks of snow, is even more poetic and picturesque. As for eating, champagne and brandy are much more precious than the ancient village wine. Wouldn't this passing-the-cold picture be even more magnificent when painted? And the characters participating in this passing-the-cold picture are naturally all blessed people who have cultivated their virtues for several lifetimes.

However, now there is an even greater and more magnificent passing-the-cold picture. This great and magnificent passing-the-cold picture is almost painted on the newspapers every day, and I think all compatriots have already appreciated it. This passing-the-cold picture can be called the "Ethnic Passing-the-Cold Picture." The characters participating in this passing-the-cold picture are all patriotic heroes and national warriors. Although there is thick snow piled up ankle-deep, there are hard blocks of ice everywhere, and there are also "white fur whirlwinds" like sharp blades that can freeze people to death instantly, our heroic heroes and warriors still rely on a burst of enthusiasm, not afraid of the cold that makes fingers and skin crack, aiming their guns, waving their bayonets, fighting in blood, chasing and killing the enemy, and recovering lost territory. They are so fearless of death, unafraid of the cold, and only know the enthusiasm and belief in fighting for the survival of the nation and fighting for the personality of the country, galloping on the battlefield and moving forward bravely. As a result, not only do victory reports come frequently, and our enemy is defeated, but even the surrounding cold air is dispersed, and victory flowers dyed with hot blood bloom all over the ground. There is no doubt that the wonderful flower of our national revival is also nurtured in it. Isn't this ethnic passing-the-cold picture the greatest and most magnificent passing-the-cold picture before our eyes?

Of course, this great and magnificent ethnic passing-the-cold picture still needs the participation of all compatriots in the country, either in strength or in material rendering. Then, let us temporarily abandon the personal, narrow passing-the-cold actions and stand on the same front to participate in and render this ethnic passing-the-cold picture. So that this great and magnificent ethnic passing-the-cold picture will become our permanent and glorious memorial.

### Ice Skating

— Qin Xin

The weather has already entered the severe winter season. We who live in the South still don't often see ice. Although we sometimes see a thin layer of ice beside the ditches, it disappears as soon as the sun comes out. The North is not the same. At this time, the smaller rivers have already frozen solid!

People who are afraid of the cold have already hibernated at home like insects, and generally don't leave the house unless there is something important. However, there are some people who use the ice that has solidified due to the cold to do an interesting game.

"Ice skating" is very prosperous in the North in winter, especially among young students. Most of them like to play this game. The method is to wear a pair of ice skates with ice blades and run back and forth on the ice. Those who are familiar with it can do many tricks and can also play ball on the ice, called "ice hockey." In Beihai in the north and Beining Park in Tianjin, the British stadium, many people go ice skating every day. On Saturdays and Sundays, there are even more people playing, with crowds of people, which is very lively. Some vendors, for the sake of profit, have come from afar, with peanuts, melon seeds, candies, fruits, and snacks, everything, in various colors, instantly embellishing the dull winter very beautifully. Some people like to play in natural ice skating rinks (small rivers) because there is a fee for skating in scaled ice skating rinks. There are ice skates for rent there, some for a certain amount of money each time, some for a certain amount of money each season, but you can bring your own shoes, but the skating fee must be paid. That kind of scaled artificial ice skating rink is smoother than natural ice skating rinks because workers clean it every day. Sometimes there is also music played on Sunday nights, so the wealthy young masters and modern ladies all go there, firstly to pass the boring winter days, and secondly to take the opportunity to show off.

In natural ice skating rinks, most are students. They only need to buy a pair of ice skates themselves, and there are no other costs. As the sun is setting, in twos and threes, they are running on the ice. From a distance, they look like a group of butterflies, fluttering and chasing each other. They don't feel cold at all in the icy world because they are moving and running, and sometimes they even sweat, so they are healthy and strong, increase their appetite, and promote blood circulation. At the very least, they won't get "frostbite." Therefore, people generally regard ice skating as the best outdoor sport in winter.

Although there are artificial ice skating rinks in the South, they cannot be widespread, and the fees are very expensive. Natural ice skating rinks cannot be realized due to weather conditions. We who live in the South can only envy their luck.

### The Old Teacher Wearing Broken Shoes

— Shi

On Cannington Street, there was an old man pushing a cart, limping, wearing very large broken boots, with a pitiful and laughable appearance, walking crookedly on the street. This appearance will never be forgotten by Charlie Chaplin, the world's greatest comedian. He always waited for the old man, taking the opportunity to imitate his walking posture. His mother scolded him for not making fun of the poor old man. But young people cannot experience the suffering of the elderly. Mr. Zhuo found it very interesting to learn this way of walking, so he ignored his mother's advice and continued to imitate the poor old man's way of walking. Who knew that this way of walking would make people in the world laugh!

### Talking About Nicknames

— Ding Rongguan

"Nickname," also known as "mixed name" or "moniker," is a common slang! I think everyone knows it. For example, if we make fun of Lao Li and call him "cigarette canister," after everyone recognizes and approves it, and unanimously calls out jokingly, this "cigarette canister" becomes Lao Li's nickname. The origin of nicknames is initially just for fun and games, so some nicknames are appropriate, and some are unreasonable and very unpleasant to hear. And a moniker is ultimately not a "proper name," so it only circulates among friends, and is especially prevalent among frivolous students in schools and the lower classes of society, such as bums and bandits. In the circles of moralists and the upper class, nicknames naturally do not exist! Because nicknames are ultimately not to be mentioned in polite company.

Because of this, it is difficult to verify when nicknames originated. Check ("Research on Leisure Industries": "Common people are frivolous in evaluating officials, and often have mixed names. Lü's Spring and Autumn Annals, Selected Essays: Xia Jie is called 'Moving Great Sacrifice,' praising his great strength to push cows down. This is the beginning of mixed names." From this point of view, nicknames in our country have a history of about four thousand years.

If a person's nickname also follows the proper name to be passed down immortally, it may not be an interesting thing. Yang Jiong and Luo Binwang of the "Four Great Talents of the Early Tang Dynasty" are like this. Jiong likes to use the names of ancient people as pairs in his writing, and at the time, he was called "Register of Ghosts." And Luo Binwang likes to use numbers as pairs: "A handful of soil is not dry, where is the six-foot orphan" is already an immortal line, and also "The Passes of Qin are a hundred and two, the palaces of Han are thirty-six" in the Di Jing Pian, "And discuss thirty-six thousand is, how can one know that forty-five years are not all" is why the world calls him "Calculation Scholar."

Nicknames are commonplace in martial arts novels. Shi Nai'an wrote the Water Margin, giving each of the 108 heroes a moniker, which is already known to everyone. That was still only the Yuan Dynasty! It is strange to say that this thing is not only popular throughout China, up and down, but unexpectedly, foreigners also have so-called nicknames. For example, the English and American Nickname, its meaning is nickname, such as calling Joho Jack and William Bing. As for our calling red-headed police officers "red-necked Ah San" and calling monkeys "Ah San," it may not be a mutation of nicknames!

Miscellaneous Remarks

### Jiangnan Daughter

— Lu Guanying

Before I mention Jiangnan daughters, I must first talk about the scenery of Jiangnan: "Jiangnan is good... how can one not remember Jiangnan." All those who have been to Jiangnan have an indelible love for Jiangnan, manifesting in dreams and words, and they cannot calm themselves. In the fertile fields near the provincial capital of Ningxia, the locals call it the Jiangnan outside the Great Wall; the grasslands in the Aksu River basin of Xinjiang are also called Little Jiangnan by the locals. Compared with the actual Jiangnan, it is really a small witch seeing a great witch. But their effect can show how much they admire Jiangnan. Jiangnan is worthy of pride.

As for what kind of beauty Jiangnan has that can make people so infatuated? Du Fu once had a Jiangnan Spring poem saying: "Ten miles of orioles sing, green reflects red, water conservancy mountain city wine banner wind, four hundred and eighty temples in the Southern Dynasty, how many pavilions in the misty rain," the misty rain pavilions, the orioles singing for ten miles, although it is enough to describe it, but it is not only spring that is like this, it can simply be said to be the norm throughout the year. In Jiangnan, the traces of spring will never fade away eternally. Su Zizhan's Divination Tune poem says: "It is only sending spring away, and then sending you away. If you go to Jiangnan to catch up with the competition, be sure to live with spring!" Having sent spring away in other places, rushing to Jiangnan, you can still see the beautiful spring light stored there. Spring is the soul of Jiangnan, and Jiangnan itself is spring.

Similarly, what is worthy of our infatuation is the beautiful Jiangnan daughter nurtured by this beautiful Jiangnan, because the spiritual beauty of Jiangnan is completely concentrated on their bodies. Their temperament is between sanguine and nervous. According to general research and analysis, it is felt that they have the courage and tenacity of German daughters, the restraint of Celtic daughters, the enthusiasm of Latin daughters, and the innocence of Moorish daughters. The essences of various ethnic groups, like bees spreading pollen, have all been brought to Jiangnan daughters by the Creator. Making this cluster of daughters, who have been exclusively caged, bloom extraordinarily brightly.

However, due to the oppression of the autocratic political system and the old ethics, the characteristics of Jiangnan daughters cannot be well expressed, but are latent in the depths of the soul. Therefore, the phantom shape that emerges above the characteristics, we see nothing but some quiet and virtuous styles. This quiet and virtuous style has usurped the main role, almost becoming their root nature. They gently and slowly listen carefully, speak with their eyes, and quietly let precious life slip away from their pulse. The great work "Quiet Life" praised by the beautiful Prussian Queen Louise of Vendier, although it speaks of Prussia at that time, seems to bear some resemblance to the snapshot of Jiangnan daughters. Precisely because of their excessive "quietness," they have lost the vitality of great life. Like the world-famous Madame Roland, like Mary, who established the revolutionary banner in France, like Queen Catalina of Naples, who possessed the spirit of the dictator, like the master of female writers, the Englishwoman George Eliot. In Jiangnan and even the whole of China, from the Middle Ages to modern times, not a single one can be found. This is not because the swelling of their sensibility has driven away the spirit of resistance and enterprise, but it can be said that the quiet and virtuous style created by the environment has made them different. Although the autocratic political system has now perished, the old ethics have changed color, and the entire environment has changed, their long-latent hot nature has still not emerged. They have betrayed the lively Jiangnan of heaven's opportunity, betrayed their own ambitions, and betrayed the gifts of the Creator.

Although we cannot say that "quiet and virtuous" is necessarily bad. It is simply praised by everyone as the typical private virtue of daughters, but the current era of turbulent waves has revealed another solemn meaning to us, making us feel that this kind of private virtue cannot be regarded as the only criterion for modern women. Now the most urgent question is how to reconstruct the psychology of daughters, so that they can practice their bodies, invigorate their spirits, and let the weak style gradually fade and be discarded from the awakened rationality.

Jiangnan is the essence of the entire China, and Jiangnan daughters are the crystallization of this essence. In the large-scale national battles of the future, Jiangnan daughters will be the vanguard of the nation's daughters.

Chapter 9 (Cup of Water Alliance Heart Green Smoke Speaks of Haggardness Hook Gold Rings Red Beans Report Mutual Love)

When he got to the study, he saw a copy of Li Yishan's collection of poems on his bookshelf, placed on the desk, with a copper ruler pressing the book, clearly someone had been reading the book here. Because he had not touched this collection of poems for a long time, it would not have come to the desk. In the middle of the book page, there was also a small piece of paper, exposed outside. He took out the slip of paper and saw that there were seven characters written on it in ink. It was "This body is like mud-stained catkins." Looking at the handwriting, it was clearly written by Youmei. These seven characters are worth studying. Does he say that he is a mud-stained catkin, or that he already belongs to someone and can no longer fly? Or is he treating me as mud and he has already been stained by it? But neither of these two sayings makes sense. He already belongs to someone, and I have no intention of him, why tell me? If he says he is stained by me, I myself don't even know about it. But he actually left these seven characters, that is meaningful, no wonder Tianda came here. He himself has already fallen into the web of love for a Jiang Menglan, could it be that he is also attracting this Li Youmei? He held this slip of paper, only looking at it in his hand, chanting it repeatedly, then Aunt Liu came in and reported a message to him, so he was even more absent-minded.

Chapter 10 (Silk Handkerchief Expresses Deep Love Strange Article Plans Wrong Yellow Flowers Face Haggard Autumn Letter Adds Sorrow)

In the past two months, Zhang Guoqi has been in a daze, all thinking about Miss Jiang Menglan. Not only would the second girl not be in his heart, but even the flower branches in the vase and the little birds raised in the birdcage, which had always been valued as much as eating and wearing clothes, now sometimes the vase was forgotten to change the water, and the birdcage was forgotten to add food. As for women with no feelings, of course, they would not divert his attention. At this time, he received the slip of paper that Li Youmei had left on the table, and he was very puzzled. He didn't expect that she would be in love with me. We are relatives, why didn't he pay attention to me before? While he was hesitating, Aunt Liu came in. He asked: Sir, don't you want to get some water to wash your face? Guoqi was holding a slip of paper in his hand and was just in a trance. Aunt Liu's words were not heard. Aunt Liu stood aside, watching him take the slip of paper and just look at it, then smiled: Sir, oh! I forgot to tell you something. That Miss Li, she came again. She sat in your study for a long time, no one accompanied her, she didn't say anything. I came in and poured her tea, did he have anything to say? She said nothing, waiting for the sir.

### Civil Servant National Goods Year

— Shi Weizhi

It is said that this year is the "Civil Servant National Goods Year." Although it has not yet been formally stipulated, it should not be difficult to pass. The reason for designating it as the "Civil Servant National Goods Year" is said to be "to lead society and use national goods."

Using national goods is the duty of every citizen, and the meaning of this probably does not need to be repeated. The leadership of society by civil servants is indeed a fact. If they shout from a high place, all the mountains will echo. I would very much like to see this grand occasion, let alone "lead by example"?

But one cannot help but think of the national goods years that have existed before. I have never paid attention to the results of these national goods years, so I cannot answer a word, but those who are engaged in the "National Goods Year" are the clearest. What are the feelings gained from comparing these national goods years from beginning to end? I do not know. But I think it may be used as a reference. To put it absolutely, I think it is also not difficult to use it as the answer to the "Civil Servant National Goods Year" in advance. For me, I naturally hope that this answer will not be too "silent and laughing," or even unable to laugh out loud at all.

The National Goods Year has changed several names so far. What I can still vaguely remember is "Women's National Goods Year," "Citizen's National Goods Year," and so on. If the results of these national goods years were good, according to my simple thinking, there would probably be no need for "civil servants" to "lead society" again. But now we have to have a "Civil Servant National Goods Year," and it is even said to be "to lead society." "Leading society" is naturally a good thing, but if one does not work hard in one's own duty, but can improve under the leadership of others, that seems a bit too optimistic.

Or we can automatically narrow the scope a bit and say that the "Civil Servant National Goods Year" is specifically for civil servants. Civil servants are usually accustomed to abiding by "discipline," and there are also established disciplinary measures, so it seems that it will definitely be effective. I am reluctant to guess what the result will be, so let's see what happens in the future. But we know that although using national goods is the duty of citizens, its starting point must be in love. The explanation of the two words "love" is not coercion, and it seems difficult to be effective to force people to love. It is a joke for someone who is used to riding in a car to be forced to ride a unicycle, even if the unicycle is a national good. So the problem itself must have a national car. And if there is a national car, and the information is no less than that of imported goods, I think there will probably be no intention to "outflow rights and interests."

I would very much like to see the effectiveness of the "Civil Servant National Goods Year" on this day next year. Not only the effectiveness, but also how it is "done." At the same time, I would also like to see what kind of words will be added to the "National Goods Year" next year.

### A Miser in American Women's Circles

— Special Correspondent

In Tingley, New York, USA, there was an old woman named Hetty, who loved money as passionately as other women yearned for their lovers. When she died twenty years ago, she left her entire estate of over ten million US dollars to her son, Green. Green also died this June. Although he spent lavishly and engaged in many philanthropic endeavors, his estate was still worth eighty million US dollars at the time of his death. Initially, everyone thought he had not left a will. The US government and several state governments coveted this large fortune because, without a will, the authorities could levy heavy taxes according to the law. Calculated on eighty million, the tax would be fifty-three million US dollars. Green had residences in Texas, Massachusetts, and Florida, so the authorities in all three states had the right to collect taxes.

Just as they were thinking of getting their hands on it, Green's sister, Mrs. Wilkes of New York, suddenly produced Green's signed will, which was signed in 1908, long before his marriage, leaving all of his estate entirely to Mrs. Wilkes. This was very much in line with his mother Hetty's wishes, as the old woman was very afraid that part of the estate would fall into the hands of people outside the family. When her daughter married Mr. Wilkes and her son married Miss Harlow, it was stipulated in advance that her son-in-law and daughter-in-law could not inherit her property. Therefore, before her son's marriage, he signed a contract with his fiancée, in which she received $625,000 and an annual alimony of $18,000, and relinquished her right to inherit Green's estate. However, Green's widow, Miss Harlow, has now filed a lawsuit in the Tingley, New York court, demanding to inherit her late husband's property, arguing that she signed the contract hastily because she did not understand its contents at the time. She also said that her husband had another will, but it has not been found to this day. Mrs. Green is in a very advantageous position in this competition because the court in Texas has declared that all of Green's property in the state is under her control. This property consists of various immovable assets such as land and railways, and if taxes are levied, the authorities could obtain nine million US dollars, which would almost pay off the municipal bonds of Texas. At the same time, Mrs. Wilkes has also filed a lawsuit in court seeking permission to take over her brother's estate, and she feels even more confident because she holds the deceased's will. Who will ultimately enjoy this large fortune depends on the court's decision.

Speaking of the original owner of this fortune, the old woman Hetty, she was the daughter of a wealthy family and was stingy and loved money like her life from a young age, never spending a penny. Therefore, after decades of accumulation, she became the richest woman in America. There are many anecdotes about her that are laughable. The uppers and soles of the shoes she wore were bought from two different places, and then she asked a cobbler to sew them together. This was much cheaper than the price in large shoe stores. Whenever she had guests, she would blow out the candles on the table before the guests left the room in order to sell the leftover candle stubs for money. When she was young, although she was very beautiful, the clothes she wore were tattered like those of a poor girl. Her husband also had property worth more than a million, but he was not as stingy as Hetty. Although Hetty already possessed a huge fortune at the time, she still demanded that her husband provide for her expenses. When she spent a few cents on transportation when going out, she often felt heartache when she thought about it upon returning. Therefore, she was very worried about her husband's extravagant behavior. Later, her husband failed in speculation on the stock exchange, so he relied on her for a living. She was very happy because she could restrain her husband as a result.

This old woman devoted herself to accumulating wealth every day and never engaged in any productive business, unwilling to spend a penny unless absolutely necessary. She never paid small bills when she occasionally went to restaurants, and the waiters in the restaurants knew that she was a tightwad. She only had income and rarely had expenses, so her family fortune accumulated more and more. She never rented an office to handle property matters because it was too expensive. Therefore, she placed a desk in the corner of the basement of the bank she opened. She was a master of tax evasion. In order to avoid paying taxes, she often moved her residence, seeking only to save money and not caring about appearances. Her clothes and furniture were terrible. Once, she carried a large bag of money to her bank. An employee in the bank said to her, "Madam! You should take a car when you carry so much money." She replied, "Would you like to pay for me?" She did not care about anything except money matters. Sometimes, because of money matters, she was involved in lawsuits with people. She was afraid of paying lawyers' fees, so she defended herself in court. She was eloquent and often won the case. She lived in a low house in Hoboken and called herself Dewey. Dewey was the name of her beloved dog, because she was afraid that people would know her real name and come to pester her, so she used the dog's name. Everyone said that this beloved dog did not know what kind of fortune it had to receive her love. She died of a stroke in 1916.

Her son inherited the entire property and was very capable in business. However, inheriting his father's genes, he spent money very generously. He lived in a very comfortable mansion and often provided tuition for more than a dozen female students in middle and vocational schools. He spent millions of dollars promoting the radio industry and built a large aviation station for the government for aviation experiments. Although he spent a lot of money, his estate was still worth eighty million US dollars when he died this summer.

Chinese and Western (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM Opening "Xiao Xiang Night Rain"

Clouds of mist envelop the curtained room. The moon is dim, the moonlight hazy. An Xiang Xiang Hall shrouded in gloom. A few green gauze windows cold and dreary. Thousands of Gan Lang bamboos rustle and sigh. Several skinny plum blossoms show green. A melancholy lady languishes with sickness. Two little maids stand silently by. Only to see, a thin Luo shirt so flimsy and frail. A sallow face, yellow as a withered flower. Eyes drowsy, sorrow adds to grief. Eyebrows furrowed, resentment fills her breast. Quietly she sits on the Xiang Fei bed. Softly leaning against the ivory frame. Dimly flickers a lonely candle's tear. Half a cup of medicinal soup is icy cold. Pity her, panting for breath. Her heart fluttering. Coughing constantly. Tears brimming. Blood stains soaking through the thin Luo skirt. Her emotions are deep, deep, her heart filled with apprehension, sighing one sigh after another, so desolate. Alas, she is far, far from her homeland. A lonely, lonely figure, she lodges in a foreign land. The road is long, thousands of miles away, the white expanse obscures her old home. Faintly she fears she is nearing the Yellow Springs. It is better to beg, beg to meet Impermanence sooner. See her, her mind lost in the void. Her form lonely, all things are but vicissitudes. The night is deep, the night color so dismal. Silence reigns, the sound of sorrow grows long. Only hear, the wind soughing, the wind so mournful. The rain falling, the rain so fierce. The copper pot drips endlessly. The iron horse jingles coldly. The wind touches the curtain fishing rod. The rain drops patter against the cold window. The bell rings three times. The watchman strikes the drum for the fifth watch. The consort, cold and shivering, cannot endure the cold wind. The night is long, the night rain breaks her heart. From then on, she will be consumed by disease and drawn to the land of the dead.

Opening "New Flower Moon Lyrics"

The spring breeze of March makes the flowers bloom. Hundreds of flowers dance in the moonlight like bows. I am, slowly walking under the moonlit shadows of flowers. Passing through the moon bridge and the flower path. But see, the moon turns east, and the shadows of flowers are chaotic. Flowers bloom in the north garden, and the moonlight dissolves. The clouds break, and the moon peeps at the beauty of the flowers. Late at night, the flowers sleep, and the moon is bright. Suddenly meeting, Chang'e leaves the flower garden wrapped in moonlight. A flower fairy comes out of the moon palace. I love her, the affectionate moon shines on the dew on the flowers. The understanding flowers sway in the moonlit wind. I love her, the spirit of the moon. The form of the flower. The moonlight and flower fragrance are the same. We are, returning the moon's soul before the flowers with wine. Singing songs under the moon to the north garden. Slowly beat the flower-promoting drum in the moon. Lightly pluck the bow that shoots the moon under the flowers. When the moon sets, let the flowers send wine. When the flowers wither, there is still the moon to urge makeup. Hoping that the moon will be round, the flowers will be beautiful, and they will never be scattered. Who knows, the moon is missing, the flowers are withered, which is so sad. From now on, endless hatred for spring flowers and autumn moons, and endless hatred for autumn moons and spring flowers. Most unforgettable, unable to sleep with the bright moon and plum blossoms. Seeking flowers and stepping on the moon to the plum blossom village. Most unforgettable, the flower-like fragrance and the moon-like purity. The moon is like spirit, and the flower is like appearance. To this day, the fallen flowers have gone with the waves of the moon. The moon remains in the red of the flowers. Since ancient times, the flowers in the mirror and the moon in the water are generally empty.

### "Lust Demon" Story

Original title: The Power of Darkness

Original Author: Tolstoy

Adapted and Directed by: Ouyang Yuqian

Zhang Yufu, a wealthy farmer, is old and ill, and his temperament is eccentric. His young second wife, Hua Yueying, cannot bear to live with him and eventually falls in love with the farmhand, Li Qi, but is restricted by the surveillance of Xiao Jin, Zhang's daughter from his first marriage.

The farmhand's father, Li Tianshun, is an honest man who acts according to his conscience. He and his old wife, Li Hongshi, come to Zhang's house to ask their son to return home to marry, because their son has already had physical relations with a washerwoman, Wang Xiuying. He insists that they become husband and wife to atone for this sin.

The farmhand's mother, Li Hongshi, is a greedy and cunning old woman. When she arrives at Zhang's house and discovers that her son is in love with the mistress, she helps them to cancel the marriage, and suggests that the mistress, Hua Yueying, poison her husband and marry her son, so that her son can seize Zhang's property.

Driven by lust, Hua Yueying is persuaded by Li Hongshi to poison her husband. But she is, after all, a weak woman. She is panicked when she starts, and afterwards leaves the money she found on Zhang Yufu's body in Li Qi's hands.

After this, Li Qi and Yueying get together and take control of Zhang's property. The young Li Qi squanders the money, indulging in a life of dissipation, and slowly becomes intimate with Xiao Jin (Zhang's daughter from his first marriage), neglecting Hua Yueying. Yueying is filled with grief and resentment, and does everything she can to marry off Xiao Jin, who has stolen her love.

Unexpectedly, Xiao Jin is already pregnant and cannot be seen when she accepts gifts at the engagement. In the middle of the night, Li Hongshi and Hua Yueying force Li Qi to bury the infant just born to Xiao Jin alive, intending to prevent the scandal from leaking out.

Killing a life is bound to cause great pain and terror in the killer's heart. Hua Yueying had already experienced this feeling when she killed her husband, and now she deliberately forces Li Qi to experience this feeling in order to get revenge. But Li Qi is originally a soft-hearted person. After this stimulation, the pain and reproaches of his conscience make it impossible for him to live in peace.

On the day Xiao Jin is married, the guests are waiting for him to come out and offer congratulations. But Li Qi is being judged by his conscience. He finally appears and announces to the crowd that he is a murderer, asking his kind father for forgiveness.

### "The Deserted Building" Showing at the Grand Shanghai

"The Deserted Building" is a famous work by the famous novelist George C. Ryley. The main characters are the rising star Rosaline Rosa and the big star John Bowers. Rosaline Rosa has previously starred in giant films such as "Scarlet and Gold". In this film, she plays a woman with a deformed personality, which is powerfully portrayed and even more movingly performed. No wonder she has received enthusiastic love from audiences around the world in less than a year. The film tells the story of a married woman's abnormal and hidden life, trying to completely isolate herself from the world in order to achieve her unspeakable secret in her heart, but the result is very tortuous. This is undoubtedly a great lesson for this realistic type. The film is directed by Hollywood's only female director, Tyra Rosanna. It will be shown at the Grand Shanghai Theater starting today.

### "Crossroads" Medley

Zhao Dan and Yiming live in the front building, and Bai Yang lives in the back building, but they don't know it.

Sha Meng and Lu Ban live on the third floor of a Russian family's home, and Kang Jian lives across the street. She is a very wealthy woman.

Lu Ban is an optimistic artist. There are many oil paintings and plaster statues in the room. The job he found is window display design.

Sha Meng is about to go to the Northeast to join the volunteer army within days, and Yiming has not yet committed suicide.

Bai Yang watched "La Traviata" and saw a photo of Zhao Dan. She will soon dream of meeting He Mang, who is Zhao Dan.

Zhao Dan waited for Bai Yang in the park a few days ago, but she hadn't arrived yet. So he started practicing speaking and acting, accidentally stepping into the pool. It was Shen Xiling who taught him the lines.

Zhao Dan is currently preparing 19th-century costumes, preparing to give Bai Yang a dream.

The two songs sung by Zhao Dan, "In Spring" and Sha Meng's "Thinking of Hometown", were recently recorded at Baidai and achieved excellent results.

Ying Yin plays Bai Yang's girlfriend in this play. She is an experienced female worker and performs very well.

You Guangzhao's unemployed teacher has made great progress in his lines.

Automobile Special Issue

### Prospects for the American Automobile Industry

— Xi

Relates to the National Economic Structure, Production Ranks First, This Year's Sales Expected to Increase, Market Quite Optimistic

The automobile manufacturing industry has a significant relationship with the American economic structure. Among various industries, its position consistently ranks at the top. This is because, in automobile manufacturing, everything from raw material sourcing to labor manufacturing is deeply connected. Mr. Hanson, an American, recently drafted an article on the overview of the American automobile industry. The materials collected are detailed and quite interesting. I have translated the main points with concern. Reading it can also provide insight into the American automobile manufacturing industry.

Ranking First Among All Industries: It is widely known that automobile manufacturing is one of the largest industries in America. In reality, what is related to this industry is not limited to manufacturing. For instance, the selection and production of raw materials, the manufacturing of parts and tires, and the refining of gasoline are just a segment of this long chain. Furthermore, America's highway network and the ubiquitous repair stations are also byproducts of the development of the automobile industry. The value of goods produced by the automobile industry ranks first in the manufacturing sector. If compared with other industries, it ranks third, only after agriculture and construction. According to recent estimates, from 1925 to 1935, the total value of automobile products was US$37,000,000,000. During this period, the value of agricultural products was US$102,000,000,000, and construction was US$95,000,000,000.

The automobile industry is the most important creator of job positions. According to statistics from the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, in 1935, the automobile transportation industry (including the production of automobiles and their by-products, road construction, etc.) directly and indirectly employed 6,000,000 people. In other words, one out of every seven employed people belongs to the automobile industry.

The automobile industry, due to its vast scope and detailed branches, is able to rank first among various manufacturing industries. One of the reasons it has achieved this leading position is that it is a major consumer of many products. The automobile industry is the largest buyer of steel, gasoline, lubricating oil, rubber, glass, nickel, lead, and wool. According to "Iron Age" magazine, in 1935, the automobile industry used approximately 6,075,000 tons of steel, accounting for 24.8% of American steel production. According to statistics from the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, 75% of the nation's produced sheet glass is used by the automobile industry.

Raw Material Consumption: The automobile industry uses approximately 80% of the total rubber produced. The consumption of other raw materials is as follows: upholstery leather (%), 30; aluminum, 37; copper, 20; tin, 13; lead, 37; zinc, 16; nickel, 31. In addition, it uses a large amount of various agricultural products. Therefore, any changes in automobile production will greatly affect other product industries. However, the automobile industry's relevance to general businesses does not stop there. The prosperity or decline of the market, and the growth or decline of people's purchasing power, are all intrinsically related to the automobile industry.

The products of the automobile industry are slightly different from other products. These items are semi-durable goods. Even when old, they can be replaced later. Therefore, the prosperity or decline of its market depends on economic conditions. During the recent economic downturn, the activity of the automobile industry was reduced to a minimum. At the same time, other industries were also greatly distressed. Similar to the situation of the automobile industry was construction. Although the purchase of new cars was temporarily delayed, the purchasing surge before the recent economic downturn was very high. Therefore, the need for replacements is now extremely urgent. Since the need for new cars began in 1932, it has continued to increase, except for a slight setback in 1933. Once the automobile industry rises, other industries will also jump out of the circle of decline.

It would be inaccurate to say that the automobile industry only occupies a leading position and is not affected by the environment. The activity phenomena of general business can be easily felt by the automobile industry. During seasons when people's purchasing power falls, the number of car sales immediately decreases. This is because, during economic downturns, the public can only use a small amount of income for purchasing cars. Currently, various industries are thriving, and people's income has increased, so the amount spent on purchasing cars has also increased significantly.

Large Number of Replacements: Whether the automobile market can permanently maintain its leading position in the future, this question can be answered based on the current situation. The market for new cars is very robust. The number of people paying for cars in installments is also increasing daily. The number of new car registrations in the autumn of 1935 was the largest since 1929. The number is not far from the record year. The registration of commercial trucks has also reached a new record high. The forecast orders for the 1937 models indicate that the new car sales market will continue to increase. The used car market is also improving.

What will the sales be like in 1937? At this time when new cars are just entering the market, it is difficult to make an estimate. We will take several important factors as clues for estimation. The largest main factor is the need for a large number of replacements. According to research by the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the average lifespan of each car is eight years and three months. Based on this determination, a large number of cars manufactured in 1929 must be replaced in 1937. Furthermore, because the car production in 1929 exceeded 5,600,000 vehicles, the potential market can be considered quite large. However, if the period of average car lifespan is shortened, this statement becomes less convincing, because the cars of 1929 have already been in the process of replacement in recent years. Fortunately, this phenomenon has not been seen in recent years, so the replacement market in 1937 should be very considerable.

Production Forecast: The automobile market for first-time new car buyers will also expand. Although this point is not as important as replacements, it is also worthy of attention. According to current estimates, the current car supply in the United States is comparable to that of 1929. If we count the population, the current population has indeed increased compared to 1929. If we consider the large potential needs based on the current economic situation, the car production in 1937 should increase by 10% compared to the level of 1936. If this becomes a reality, the output in 1937 will slightly exceed 5,500,000 vehicles. In other words, it will be only 100,000 vehicles less than the record production in 1929. The estimated output in 1936 is the second highest production in this industry, at approximately 4,650,000 vehicles. In 1935, it was 4,129,811 vehicles. In 1932, due to the economic downturn, it was 1,431,494 vehicles. In 1929, it was 5,621,715 vehicles. (These counts all include Canada.)

### Dodge Truck Goods Entering Hunan Route

The picture on the left shows the route it passed through. It is said that this Dodge truck is equipped with a spare oil tank with a capacity of 135 gallons, so it is very economical and convenient to refuel even when driving through remote areas of the mainland.
