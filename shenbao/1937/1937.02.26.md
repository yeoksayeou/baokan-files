### Tianjin Customs Held Anti-Smuggling Conference

Tax Officer Mei Weiliang and Li Xing, etc., Attended; New Decisions on Smuggling Suppression and Liaison of Customs Officers

[Tianjin] At 10 a.m. on the 25th, Tianjin Customs held an important anti-smuggling conference.

New decisions were made on smuggling suppression and close liaison between land and water customs officers, and it was decided to form an armed squad to improve the effectiveness of smuggling suppression. (Special dispatch on the 25th)

[Tianjin] On the 25th, Tianjin Customs intercepted two heavy-duty cars loaded with smuggled piece goods of rayon, a total of more than 300 pieces, in Xiaoxiyingmen in the suburbs of Tianjin. They were transported to the Customs warehouse and detained. At 3 p.m., more than 30 ruffians gathered at the Customs to make trouble. The French Patrol Police Bureau dispatched a large number of detectives to disperse them upon hearing the news. The Japanese Police Department also received the news and sent special agents to arrest six ruffians. (Special dispatch on the 25th)

[Tianjin] Tianjin Customs and the Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office for Land Transportation held a joint meeting on the 25th. Those present were Mei Weiliang, Li Xing, and Sha Bo, etc. Decisions were made on water and land liaison for smuggling suppression. Because customs officers are sometimes beaten while performing their duties, it is planned to form an armed squad to improve the effectiveness of smuggling suppression and protect the safety of customs officers. It is reported that the Finance Department's Inspection Office is currently responsible for handling railway smuggling in terms of smuggling deployment, and Tianjin Customs is in charge of water and land smuggling within the scope stipulated in the Customs regulations. In the future, after the establishment of the Inland Inspection Office, it will be responsible for investigating and suppressing river and highway smuggling in southern Hebei and northern Shandong. Therefore, although general smuggled goods can be smuggled out from here, it is feared that they will be difficult to escape due to the strict deployment in the inland. In addition, Tianjin Customs inspectors, etc., seized more than 300 pieces of smuggled goods in Xiaoxiguan on the morning of the 5th and confiscated them. However, ruffians gathered again in the afternoon to create disturbances and were driven away. Several people were arrested by the Japanese Police Department and taken back for interrogation.

Current Commentary

### Review of the Situation on the Border of Suiyuan

— Du

Since the national army on the Suiyuan border achieved victory in the war of resistance, inflicting a major blow on the bandits in the Battle of Hongge'ertu and successively recovering Bailingmiao, the tense atmosphere has gradually eased. Although a certain party's covert actions are still being actively planned, the rectification of military preparedness and supplies has not been relaxed. However, the plan for a large-scale invasion has been held back. Even local conflicts are only in the form of guerrilla warfare, with multiple probes to distract us. For the past two months, the attention of people in the hinterland has been focused first on the Xi'an Incident and then on the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. Concern for the front line of national defense has been temporarily neglected. Now that internal arrangements are generally in place and overall unity is no longer a problem, the sentiment for consistent external resistance will be even stronger than before. The recent changes in the situation on the Suiyuan border really need to be reviewed.

A certain party has long harbored the intention of gradually encroaching on Chahar and Suiyuan. Even if they have been frustrated, they will not be reconciled. We should expect them to come up with even more cunning schemes. However, due to the general trend, they have recently had to hesitate somewhat. Although they have claimed to be approaching Zhangjiakou and Dushikou, and there have been rumors that Huan Dong will have a new attack, in fact, bandits and puppets have been retreating eastward from Shangdu and Kangbao. A large amount of military supplies stored in Zhangbei have also been transported back. Recently, it has been reported that most of the puppet troops in northern Chahar have retreated into the territory of Rehe, and the Zhangbei special affairs agency has also been withdrawn to Duolun. On the surface, the disaster on the Suiyuan border seems to be temporarily relieved. Unless there are special changes, the opportunity for renewed warfare can be avoided. The reasons why a certain party has temporarily abandoned its aggressive policy are: 1. The national army's defense is solid, and the local people are determined to fight to the death. 2. The whole country is filled with righteous indignation and is united in providing support. 3. The atmosphere of defection has suddenly become strong, making it impossible to control. 4. The power of the traitors has declined, losing its purpose of utilization. A certain party has always wanted to rely on the old trick of sleeping hands, reaping without sowing, and is reluctant to use its own strength for direct contact, fearing that the situation will become too rigid and turn into an unresolvable situation. Their psychology of worrying about gains and losses is not difficult for people to see. If the national army had not defended strongly at that time, the bandits and puppets would have been able to enter directly without arousing the lofty ambition of defection. If the national support had been scattered, a certain party would have seen through our weakness and would not have had the obvious concern of Japanese support. Therefore, the current fading of the fierce flames is due to: 1. The presence of people on the front line who swear to defend the country to the death. 2. The formation of a united front in the rear.

Understanding this, if we want to maintain the integrity of the country, we must not be at a loss. With a certain party's cunning and versatility, frequent smoke screens, and feints to the east and west are their tricks. Retreating in order to advance is unpredictable. We must not misjudge the current situation and embrace a complacent optimism. We must be prepared to deal with the situation at any time with unremitting murderous intent, have the determination to sacrifice everything, and seek the concentration of the national will. Those who have ulterior motives, advocate heresy, confuse the military's morale, and undermine unity must be abandoned by the entire country.

### Personnel Changes in the Japanese Army Strengthen the Backbone

The Control Faction Gradually Enters an Era of Full Prosperity; Appointment of Chayama as Chief of the Military Affairs Section is Noteworthy

[Tokyo] The major changes in personnel in the Japanese Army, affecting the changes of commanders of the 7th Division and the promotion of 900 people, and the transfer of 1,800 officers, almost including all the cadres of the Army Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters, are highly valued by all circles in Tokyo. The current changes in personnel can enable the Japanese Army's control faction to enter an era of full prosperity. The control faction is led by Terauchi Hisaichi, Sugiyama Gen, Umezu Yoshijiro, Nakamura Kotaro, Isoya Rensuke, Ishihara, etc. Their opinions are intended to implement a gradual reform movement through legal means. The transfer of Itagaki Seishiro to the commander of the 5th Division, based on his personal experience, is a necessary step. At present, this move obviously contains the meaning of "keeping at a distance." Isoya Rensuke, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, was transferred to the commander of the 10th Division. The position of Director of the Military Affairs Bureau he left behind is the most important organ for deciding the army's internal and external policies. It is now succeeded by Kogo Atsushi. Because Kogo is very familiar with the situation in China, Chayama Kenjiro was appointed as the chief of the Military Affairs Section of the bureau. The Military Affairs Section is the most basic organ for handling the army's policies, and Chayama's appointment to this position has attracted general attention. Chayama served as a military attaché in the embassy in Beiping in 1935. Later, because his understanding of China was different from that of the central figures of the army at the time, he was recalled to serve as the commander of the 18th Regiment stationed in Kurume. Chayama expressed considerable dissatisfaction with this transfer. Now that he is about to take office as the chief of the Military Affairs Section, it is expected that he will be able to realize his long-held aspirations in the future. From the perspective of China, the appointment of Tojo as the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army and Chayama as the Chief of the Military Affairs Section should be given equal importance. It is also noteworthy that Sakai, who played an important role in the so-called Hebei Incident in 1935, has been promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to the commander of the 28th Brigade. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Tokyo] This periodic change of personnel in the army involves the promotion of 900 people and the transfer of 1,800 people, totaling 2,700 people. Both in terms of quantity and quality, it is a rare major change in recent times.

The first noteworthy point is the strengthening of the central department, especially the General Staff Headquarters. Nakajima Major General was appointed as the Director of the General Affairs Department, Ishihara Kanji Major General was appointed as the Director of the First Department, and Muto, Kawabe, and Nishihara, the three colonels, were appointed as section chiefs. Higuchi Colonel was attached to the General Staff Headquarters, consolidating the backbone. The General Staff Headquarters can be described as spectacular in recent times. It can be said that the quasi-wartime system of military orders has been established as a result. On the Army Ministry side, Kogo was appointed as the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, which is enough to compensate for the shortcomings of Isoya Major General. He was assisted by Tanaka (Military Affairs) and Chayama (Chief of the Military Affairs Section), and Kahan Major General was appointed as the Director of the Personnel Bureau, and Iida Major General was appointed as the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau. Kawamura Lieutenant Colonel was appointed as the senior section chief of the Military Affairs Section. Overall, the new lineup of the ministry can be said to have strengthened from the past.

Second, there are many points that indicate a new axis. Okabe Major General, who has never been involved in technical matters, was appointed as the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Technical Headquarters, and Aoki Colonel was appointed as the chief of the Mechanical Section of the ministry. From the perspective of past experience, they are very suitable. Also, Chayama Colonel has almost no experience in military administration, but his specialty is in Chinese relations. He was appointed to policy matters, intending to assist Director Kogo, who has no experience in Chinese relations. From the perspective of the importance of the China issue and the personality of Chayama Colonel, this is a very appropriate personnel change.

Third, the departure of Itagaki, the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and Sakanishi Ichiro and Muto Akira, the two colonels, from their positions as section chiefs can also be said to be a major change. Tojo Lieutenant General was appointed as Itagaki's successor, and great effort was made in other appointments. The lineup of the Kwantung Army is also very solid. Tojo Lieutenant General held many important positions in the central department, so he should be promoted to succeed Itagaki's important position. Although there has been discussion about Itagaki Lieutenant General's position as the commander of the 5th Division, his entry and exit from the central government can be said to be waiting for an opportunity. In short, the first personnel change of Land Minister Sugiyama can be said to be anti-Yun. (Twenty-fifth Allied Telegraph)

### Budget General Assembly Questioning Situation

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives' Budget General Assembly, originally scheduled to end the questioning on the 25th, still had 8 members from the Minseito party, 6 from the Seiyukai party, and 3 from smaller factions on the 24th, totaling 17 questioners. The board of directors convened a meeting last night and decided to change the agenda, extending the questioning by one day, and starting subcommittee meetings from the 27th. (25th, Dōmei News Agency)

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives' Budget General Assembly on the 24th convened at 7:10 PM.

Minseito member Tajima Katsutarō (Minseito Party) questions:

What about turning the Japan Iron & Steel Co. into a government-run enterprise? Also, what is the fundamental policy of the national iron and steel policy?

Minister of Commerce and Industry Godō answers:

Regarding the national iron and steel policy, we will implement concrete plans when necessary. To facilitate the import of steel materials, tariffs will be waived for two years, as the plan to increase iron and steel production can be completed within these two years. Rumors of Japan Iron & Steel centrism are circulating, but in my opinion, there should be no monopolistic ideology of Japan Iron & Steel. Nationalization of the iron and steel industry is difficult to achieve today.

Shinohara Yoshimasa (Seiyukai Party) asks:

Today, the relationship between local autonomous bodies and tribal clans is gradually weakening, and autonomous bodies tend to become incorporated. What are your views on the current state of such local systems?

Minister of Interior Kawarada answers:

The local system was adopted in the early Meiji era by Duke Yamagata, drawing from foreign models and implemented in accordance with Japan's circumstances. The results are generally commendable. If there are aspects of the tribal property system that should be improved, they will be improved.

Shinohara Yoshimasa asks what Prime Minister thinks of Finance Minister Yūki's fiscal policy, which heavily favors urban areas.

Prime Minister Hayashi answers:

Because we believed that reducing local allocation taxes would be beneficial in fiscal policy, we made revisions. We did not anticipate that rural villages would face problems like those of today.

Shinohara then stopped questioning, and the meeting adjourned at 9:10 PM. (25th, Dōmei News Agency)

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget General Assembly on the 25th convened at 10:00 AM. Katsuma Masanori (Minseito), who had previously reserved questions, rose to criticize the basis for calculating the 70 million yen adjustment allocation for local finances. He pointed out that the government's claim that reducing the local burden from 220 million yen to 70 million yen was equivalent to a reduction of 30 million yen was inaccurate, as the actual reduction was 150 million yen compared to the previous proposal. He further criticized the unfair burden between municipal and county areas, stated many local petitions, and suggested that the government increase the amount at this time.

Finance Minister Yūki answers:

Is this truly the voice of the rural villages? It is necessary for policymakers and you to give it sufficient consideration. The government intends to study it further. Can it wait until the next session of the Diet? If there is time, it can only be discussed by the government and the council.

Katsuma Masanori:

Can't the amount be increased because of the financial resources, or are there other reasons? The party's proposal is 65 million yen. Even if there are surplus financial resources, do you consider this amount to be sufficient?

Finance Minister Yūki answers:

There is no financial surplus today.

Katsuma Masanori:

What about relying on public bonds as a temporary measure, limited to one year?

Finance Minister Yūki answers:

Given the current state of the economy, it is doubtful whether even 3.5% government bonds can be absorbed. It is also uncertain whether the planned government bonds can be fully absorbed. Even in the 12th fiscal year, we must not issue them forcefully.

The Budget General Assembly reconvened at 2:30 PM. First, the committee chairman questioned the government:

During the General Assembly session, is there any hope of submitting a revised budget proposal?

Finance Minister Yūki answers:

The revised budget proposal has already been submitted to the Cabinet for deliberation and is scheduled to be submitted on the 26th. Next, Mr. Suematsu Kaichi of the Minseito party questioned the government regarding the abolition and merger of political parties and ministries, as well as the additional budget for the national policy integration agency, etc.

Prime Minister Hayashi answers:

The abolition and merger of ministries have not yet been concretely considered. Although a national policy integration agency is deemed necessary, the previous cabinet's plan is still under study, so the inclusion of an additional budget is still undecided.

Finance Minister Yūki stated that regarding the budget revision, he wanted to fully discuss the military budget with the Diet and that it would still be expressed in the budget numbers as before.

Mr. Suematsu asks:

Is there any intention to reorganize the proliferation of economic organizations and social public organizations in rural villages?

Minister of Interior Kawarada answers:

Various local organizations should be reorganized and unified, but this must be fully studied by the Local System Investigation Committee.

Mr. Suematsu asks:

What are the Minister of Interior's views on the allocation of local subsidies?

Minister of Interior answers:

About 50 to 60 million yen will be used to reduce the number of households distributed, and another 10 to 20 million yen will be used to reduce the so-called "bad taxes" miscellaneous taxes.

At this point, Mr. Suematsu discussed aviation policy and advocated for the issuance of patriotic aviation bonds.

Minister of the Army Sugiyama answers:

We will strive to develop the aviation industry.

Mr. Matsuda Takeichi (Minseito) asks:

Up until now, Japanese diplomacy has been considered passive. If Japan is to be correctly recognized internationally, it must become dynamic diplomacy.

Foreign Minister Hayashi answers:

Although I am a layman in diplomacy, I dare to speak frankly when I should assert myself, believing that this is the essence of diplomacy.

Mr. Matsuda asks:

What is the current cabinet's diplomatic policy?

Foreign Minister Hayashi answers:

Not focusing solely on economic diplomacy, we believe it should proceed towards cultural and peaceful diplomacy, so we are currently working towards this.

Takahashi Kumajirō of the Minseito party stated that rural villages must be revitalized and questioned the government's views on rural policy.

Finance Minister Yūki answers:

From a national defense perspective, the revitalization of rural villages is essential. We will strive for both material and spiritual aspects.

Mr. Takahashi asks:

Today's rural villages should aim to increase income, besides major agricultural products such as rice and cocoons. Therefore, it is appropriate to encourage the export and import of agricultural products. What is the government's view?

Finance Minister Yūki answers:

It is also necessary to not only focus on rice cultivation but to harmonize agriculture and secondary industries. Examples include woolen textiles, carpets, and tofu. We will do our best to encourage agricultural products related to import and export.

Mr. Takahashi discussed countermeasures to revitalize the Tohoku region and asked if the government intends to establish a Tohoku Agency.

The Finance Minister answered that the Tohoku budget contains a positive revitalization meaning, but the measures are not very good. The budget is not separated from the general budget, and there are no obstacles to revitalization.

Prime Minister Hayashi answers:

The establishment of the Tohoku Agency is still under study. It is not appropriate to respond regarding the revitalization expenses. The government also considers it insufficient and will make sufficient efforts in the future.

The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. (25th, Dōmei News Agency)

### Germany Stops Private Spot Transactions with Eastern Countries

New Regulations Issued by German Foreign Exchange Control Director

[Berlin] According to new regulations issued by the Director of Foreign Exchange Control, private spot transactions between Germany and Eastern and Far Eastern countries, including the Philippines and China, will be prohibited. The reason is that spot transactions with Eastern countries such as Egypt, Sudan, India, Ceylon, Burma, Siam, the Straits Settlements, China, and the Philippines do not generate a surplus in the National Bank's foreign exchange account. Therefore, private spot transactions will soon be completely stopped. (Central News Agency, 25th, Reuters)

### New China View of Parisian Scholars

Significant Progress in Construction, External Forces Hinder Revival

[Paris] Dr. Escarra, professor of law at the University of Paris, professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and legal advisor to the Chinese government, recently published a book entitled "China Past and Present." Referring to recent events in China, the book describes the country's political and social conditions clearly and in detail. It states that after the success of the Chinese Revolution in 1912, the imperial system was overthrown, and a parliamentary system was established. However, it was a rushed and superficial endeavor, so after an attempt, it failed. It was not until 1928, when the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition succeeded and the Kuomintang took power, that progress was made in all undertakings. "The National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and its stability is unmatched by previous governments after the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty." The warlord-led struggles for dominance have subsided, and civil wars are decreasing. The government is working hard to suppress the communists, which is the country's most important military action in recent years. At this time, the central authority is increasing, and unification has been achieved. Progress is being made in all undertakings, and construction work is being actively promoted. The results are obvious. Hard work is becoming a habit of the people, and striving for success is the general will. Everyone has the idea of ​​striving for excellence, and there is evidence everywhere. This is different from the past when people only knew how to be passive and do routine work. However, there are many difficulties in foreign affairs, which is a major obstacle to the country's self-reliance and innovation. In the past 100 years, some foreign countries have weakened China in order to achieve commercial goals or exercise their imperialism. This behavior has only benefited Japan. The weakening of China has ignited Japan's ambition. Japan's Greater East Asia policy is based on the annexation of China. Now that China is unified and its national strength is growing stronger, Japan will be driven out of the Asian continent, and its ambitious policy will be completely overthrown. This is why Japan is doing its best to oppose China's construction and revival efforts. "The crux of the matter at this time is whether China's evolution is purely free and proactive or will be driven by Japan." What is unknown is whether China's original power can assimilate that ambitious country that wants to control China temporarily. In the past, China has assimilated "barbarian tribes." Can it be assimilated again in the future? The current problem is a struggle between two cultures. Can China's inherent culture be transformed into a nation-state? This is what we want to know," and so on. (24th, Havas)

### British Undersecretary to Visit the United States

[London] Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Sir Robert Vansittart will travel to the United States on March 17. He may discuss naval issues in Washington. (24th, Kokumin News Agency)

### Italy Denies Four-Power Defense Alliance

German Foreign Minister Reports to Hitler, German Members of the Cultural Committee Go to Austria

[Rome] Foreign newspapers report that Italy's attitude towards German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Vienna is beyond friendly relations. Political circles here have solemnly denied reports of four-power pact negotiations between Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Italy, deeming them absurd. Italian political circles also deny that Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg will meet with Mussolini in Rome within a few days after his meeting with Neurath. Finally, rumors that Mussolini will visit Hungary are also considered unfounded. Italy is very satisfied with the results of Neurath's visit to Austria because the results are fully in line with the Rome Protocols. (24th, Kokumin News Agency)

[Berlin] Foreign Minister Neurath met with Hitler in Nuremberg today to report on his talks with key figures in the Austrian government. It is reported that four German members of the German-Austrian Cultural Committee will be von Wadsky of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Griesche of the Ministry of Education, and Weisenhofer and Menger. The German members are expected to arrive in Vienna on Thursday. (24th, Kokumin News Agency)

[London] The Times published a message this morning stating that the purpose of German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Austria was actually to annex Czechoslovakia. The news has caused considerable unease among diplomatic circles. It is said that when German Chancellor Hitler delivered a speech in the House of Representatives on the 30th of last month, outlining the international situation, he did not mention Czechoslovakia at all. This can be compared with the news published in The Times. These people also said that the Czech government recently reached an agreement with the three German nationalist action parties in the country (namely the Christian Social Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Farmers' Party) to make concessions to the German minority. However, it is not yet known what attitude the Sudeten German Party, the opposition party in the Czech Republic, will take towards this agreement. If the party refuses to join, it can be proven that it is in league with the German Nazi Party. In short, the interests that Britain possesses extend to the whole of Europe and are not limited to Western Europe. This has been repeatedly stated by Foreign Minister Eden, and British cabinet members should reiterate it. This is for a certain country to be warned that the object of British policy is limited to Western Europe. (24th, Havas)

### Eden Returns to London to Meet with French Ambassador

Discussing Diplomacy

[London] Foreign Minister Eden recently went to the French Riviera in southern France for a two-week break. He just returned to Beijing yesterday and resumed his duties. He immediately resumed contact with the British envoys from various countries. He recently received French Ambassador Corbin to discuss the European diplomatic situation, paying particular attention to the situation in Spain and Central Europe. When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Foreign Minister Eden also attended. Labour Party MP Davison raised questions about the work of the League of Nations Council. The Foreign Minister replied that between 1920 and 1930, the Council resolved a total of 24 international disputes. Since 1931, 10 cases have been resolved. (24th, Havas)

[London] Foreign Minister Eden returned to the House of Commons after his vacation today and was greatly welcomed by the public. The Foreign Minister answered questions twice, involving the Non-Intervention Committee's plan to ban volunteers from going to Spain. It is said that the International Committee agreed on February 16 to expand the non-intervention agreement to ban those who intend to serve in the Spanish army from entering Spain, and to ban the transport of arms and war materials to that country. The new ban came into effect on February 20, and he heard that the governments concerned had adopted the necessary plans. The details of the surveillance plan are still under discussion by the governments concerned and should be agreed upon in a few days. The Foreign Minister also said that the British and Portuguese governments had agreed to have 130 British personnel monitor the implementation of the non-intervention agreement on the Spanish-Portuguese border. This approach has been notified to the Non-Intervention Committee. The committee has approved in principle the special measures set by the British and Portuguese, but the details of implementation have not yet been submitted to the meeting. (Central News Agency, 24th, Reuters)

⊙ Dublin The Irish Free State Parliament today passed the bill prohibiting the continuous transport of volunteers and munitions to Spain by a vote of 77 to 50, effective from today. Before the bill was put to the final vote, the Parliament received a protest from General O'Duffy from Spain stating that the actions of the Free State government violated the beliefs of the Irish people and Christians. O'Duffy is currently leading Irish volunteers on the Madrid front, assisting General Franco, the leader of the National Army, in the war. (Central News Agency, 25th, Reuters)

[London] The House of Lords met this afternoon and held a debate on foreign policy. Lord Arnold, a member of the National Labor Party, spoke, advocating that British policy should be adapted to the actual international situation, which is that the League of Nations is weak and collective security is a mere formality. Lord Arnold then vehemently attacked the mutual assistance pacts concluded between France and Russia and between the Czech Republic and Russia, saying that "the result is that Germany is partially surrounded." Foreign Minister Eden should advise France to abolish the mutual assistance pacts between France and Russia and notify the Czech Republic that if a certain accident occurs because of the mutual assistance pacts between the Czech Republic and Russia, Britain will be unable to help the Czech Republic. Later, Lord Strabolgi, a member of the opposition Labour Party, spoke, expressing his opposition to the suggestions made by Lord Arnold, saying that in the years between 1925 and 1936, the Mediterranean region was fraught with danger. At that time, France provided Britain with a guarantee, willing to help Britain in the event of an incident. Britain benefited greatly from this, and it should not be forgotten. Speaking of the Czech Republic, he said that if the Czech Republic is invaded by another country without provocation, Britain has an obligation to provide assistance in accordance with the League of Nations covenant. He also believed that the British government should clearly express how it intends to act in response if a dispute occurs in Eastern Europe, so that a certain country will be warned and know what to be vigilant about. Speaking of Germany, he said that the scope of the mutual assistance pacts between France and Russia should be expanded to allow Germany to participate in them. This is what he hopes for. The conclusion is that the British government must pay close attention to the policies of the United States, more than ever before. Finally, Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth spoke on behalf of the government, explicitly rejecting the suggestions made by Lord Arnold, saying, "Our country has great interests and heavy responsibilities in Europe. The military equipment that our country has set up is necessary to maintain these interests and fulfill these responsibilities. As for its use, it will never be allowed to conflict with the League of Nations covenant. Therefore, if France and Belgium are invaded without provocation, we should, according to our obligations, use this military force to protect the safety of these countries," he said. (24th, Havas)

### Abyssinian General Captured, Refuses to Surrender, Dies Calmly

Italian Governor Reports Failed Negotiations, Related to Addis Ababa Bombing

[Rome] General Dejazmach Tesfaye, the commander-in-chief of the southern military and political affairs of Abyssinia and the son-in-law of the exiled emperor, hid in the Great Lakes region after being defeated by Italian Governor Graziani. He was captured by an Italian guerrilla team. Many others were captured at the same time. The Italian governor gave Tesfaye a week to surrender, but Tesfaye, as a general, preferred to die rather than surrender, so he was executed by firing squad today. Tesfaye was about 32 years old, of moderate stature, and had a beautiful appearance. In 1932, because of his meritorious service to the central government, the emperor specially awarded him the rank of general. The area he governed was the West Tamo Borana province near the Somaliland border, which was extremely wealthy. He owned the Addis Ababa water plant. One of his privileges was to collect municipal donations from Addis Ababa brothels, but Tesfaye exempted all but a small amount of damage collected from brothels selling alcohol. His troops numbered between 80,000 and 100,000. He originally planned to lead them to invade Italian Somaliland, or to spy on Mogadishu, or to advance to the border of British Somaliland to cut off the retreat route of Italian General Graziani's troops. Tesfaye was one of the most famous generals in Abyssinia, and he was a passionate patriot. He usually wore Abyssinian clothes. Before the split between Italy and Abyssinia, Belgium sent an army delegation to Abyssinia. When the war broke out, one of the country's officers and several Russian soldiers served in Tesfaye's army. Last month, four Italian troops, at least 20,000 in total, besieged Tesfaye in several routes. At that time, Tesfaye still had 10,000 troops, holding out in the area east of Lake Margherita. Everyone expected that if Tesfaye was captured, he would be executed by firing squad to end his life. (25th, Central News Agency, Reuters)

[Rome] Abyssinian son-in-law General Dejazmach Tesfaye was shot on the spot today after being captured by Italian troops near Lake Benna in the west. The circumstances were reported to Prime Minister Mussolini by Abyssinian Governor General Graziani as follows. It is said that after the arrest of General Imru, the leader of the government in Gojjam, western Abyssinia, I immediately sent a representative to negotiate with General Dejazmach Tesfaye to persuade him to surrender. But Dejazmach Tesfaye was perfunctory with the representatives, delaying the time, while concentrating his forces to make a bid. After receiving the report, I personally commanded the troops to advance to the Lake Chana area. Although I was besieged repeatedly, Dejazmach Tesfaye was still able to escape. Until recently, I ordered Lieutenant Dusi to lead a team of native soldiers to track him down before he was captured in front, and in order to eliminate future troubles, I ordered Lieutenant Dusi to execute him on the spot. After the arrest of General Imru, Dejazmach Tesfaye was the only Abyssinian general who continued to resist. According to the news received this morning, Dejazmach Tesfaye died from gunfire while commanding the battle. In fact, he was shot after being captured. It is heard that Dejazmach Tesfaye recently planned to capture the city of Addis Ababa. The assassination of General Graziani by natives a few days ago was related to this matter. It is also said that General Dejazmach Tesfaye, as the son-in-law of the Abyssinian emperor, was rumored to represent his father-in-law at the coronation ceremony of the British King in May.

[Paris] After Italian Governor General Graziani was injured by an assassin in Addis Ababa a few days ago, Italian officials immediately arrested more than 2,000 suspects. According to news received by Le Petit Journal from the city, 1,400 of these people have been sentenced to death by summary procedure and executed by firing squad. (25th, Havas)

[Rome] After the Italian Governor General in Abyssinia was attacked by ten people and injured, foreign newspapers published news saying that of the 2,000 suspects arrested by Italian officials, 1,400 had been executed by summary procedure. The propaganda department issued a statement today denying this and saying that the news was absurd and obviously had other motives, because there were many important issues that needed to be dealt with at this time. Italian people were not paying attention to the issue of how to punish the native rebels in the colonies. (25th, Havas)

### Britain's International Payments Last Year

Deficit Almost Nil - American Free Trade Policy - Praised by British Merchants

[London] According to a speech delivered today at the National Liberal Club by British Minister of Commerce, Mr. Runciman, Britain's international payments deficit for 1926 was almost nil. Mr. Runciman stated that the total amount of this deficit was calculated last night. Before including invisible exports, the deficit for the year was nearly 340 million pounds. The trade deficit seemed too large, but we need not be alarmed. We have the capacity to fully cover this amount. After including invisible exports, our deficit is actually only 19 million pounds, not 340 million pounds. This amount is truly insignificant. It is noted that Britain's trade had a surplus of 33 million pounds in the previous year, while last year's deficit was due to a large amount of visible imports, silver, gold, etc., amounting to approximately 347 million pounds, compared to 260 million pounds in 1935. On the other hand, last year's merchant shipping revenue increased by 20 million pounds to 95 million pounds, and overseas investment income increased by 15 million pounds to 195 million pounds. According to the instructions of the local news editor of The Times, the majority of Britain's trade deficit last year was due to increased import prices. (Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch, 24th)

[London] Commerce Minister Runciman praised US Secretary of State Hull's policy of promoting world peace through the free exchange of goods in a speech at the National Liberal Club today. Mr. Runciman recounted his recent trip to the United States and also praised President Roosevelt's boldness, saying that the United States' free trade policy is a sure way to promote peace. Britain is also progressing towards this goal. If the economic policies of Britain and the United States can proceed in parallel without contradiction, the whole world can benefit together.

### German Church Dispute

Pastors Issue Five Demands - Conditions for Attending Religious Conference

[Berlin] Regarding the recent disputes in the German Church, not long ago, German Minister of Religious Affairs Kerr issued a final warning to the pastors, threatening to suspend all anti-government pastors. However, the pastors were unmoved and directly presented to Head of State Hitler the sole condition for universal participation in the election of the Religious Conference. These conditions include: ㊀ Freedom of speech, ㊁ Freedom of assembly, ㊂ Unconditional release and reinstatement of all arrested pastors, ㊃ Future elections of the Religious Conference should be held in accordance with church practice, ㊄ Recognition of the church's right to not cooperate with the Nazi Party organization, "German Christians". The universal election of the Religious Conference was a decree personally issued by Hitler after the resignation of the National Religious Committee. The National Religious Committee was originally ordered to mediate the disputes between pure clergy and the so-called "German Christians," but resigned after failing to mediate. The task of the Religious Conference is to approve a new constitution for the German Church. (Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

### Wei Yisan Inspects Military and Political Affairs in England

### The Japanese 70th Diet's "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back"

1.  The Diet Reopens After Many Twists and Turns

Tokyo Dispatch: When the Japanese 70th Diet reopened on January 21, it did not continue due to an argument between Hamada Kunimatsu, a representative of the Seiyukai, and former Minister of the Army, Terauchi Juichi. As reported in the newspapers, such a conflict might have been easily resolved with a night's rest in normal times. However, the situation at that time not only did not allow for such a simple solution but also led to the resignation of the Hirota Cabinet, the abortive formation of the Ugaki Cabinet, and the emergence of the Hayashi Cabinet. During this period, the Diet was first ordered to suspend sessions for two days, then to adjourn for ten days, and then to suspend sessions twice more due to the new cabinet's revisions of various bills. In total, the interruption lasted 22 days, the longest in the history of the Japanese Diet. The Hirota Cabinet resigned during a Diet session, an unprecedented event except for the Katsura Cabinet in 1923, which collapsed due to the Movement for the Protection of the Constitution. Ugaki was ordered to form a cabinet, but it was aborted due to opposition from the military, a situation that had only occurred once before, during the era of Kiyoura Keigo in the Taisho period. Now, from January 23 to 29, two major events occurred within a week. The instability of the Japanese political situation is evident from this.

2.  The Prime Minister's Ten-Minute Speech

After "hibernating," the Diet finally reopened on February 15. That day, the sky was clear and without a cloud, creating an interesting contrast of light and darkness compared to the bleak and gloomy weather of January 21. Although we still went to observe, seeing the past week's avoidance of conflict between the political parties and the Hayashi Cabinet, we anticipated that there would not be any dramatic scenes.

The joint session of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives was originally scheduled to convene at 1:00 PM, but it was delayed until 2:00 PM because Hamada Kunimatsu temporarily requested that his defense against the military be added to the agenda. The various factions discussed the matter, fearing that this would cause unexpected disputes, and advised him to abandon it. The Diet's attitude of evading the military's sharp edge and seeking temporary peace was exposed at this time.

Hayashi Senjuro's policy speech as Prime Minister lasted only twelve minutes, and the foreign policy speech by the concurrently serving Foreign Minister lasted only six minutes, for a total of less than twenty minutes. There was much applause from the Liberal Democratic Party down below, in stark contrast to the shouting and jeering during Hirota's speech last time.

3.  Yuki Toyotaro Takes the Stage

Finance Minister Yuki then rose to speak. Although Yuki was one of the six cabinet members in the new cabinet with no experience in the Diet, his demeanor and attitude were much better than Baba's. His voice was very loud during the speech. A Japanese reporter satirically said, "Yuki's voice must have been borrowed from somewhere" because of his small stature and loud voice, which was quite meaningful. However, it is undeniable that Yuki is one of the most "popular" members of the Hayashi Cabinet. The characteristics of his entire speech were simplicity and directness. He did not express any views on the future of Japanese finance or his ambitions, but simply read through the budget outline and described a few facts about the revision of Baba's original plan. However, he boldly admitted that the current huge budget and tax increases were due to the unavoidable increase in national military spending. In particular, he frankly admitted in his later answers that he had no understanding of the prospects for Japanese finance. This attitude can at least be described as very sincere. Aside from someone in the audience shouting "What about the rural areas?" with a mocking laugh when he talked about stabilizing the people's livelihood, the general support was well-intentioned. In the end, even the Socialist People's Party applauded him as he left the podium.

4.  The Course of Questioning

After Yuki's speech, it was the turn of the Diet members to ask questions. The content of the individual questions has generally been reported in the newspapers. Here, we will provide a comprehensive report on several important areas of questioning and answers from the Diet—both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives—on that day. Among them, Sino-Japanese diplomacy is most relevant to us, so it will be described first:

㊀ Regarding Sino-Japanese Diplomacy: Not only did Hayashi himself state clearly in his foreign policy speech, "The governments and peoples of China and Japan should be closer to achieve the reality of Sino-Japanese cooperation and mutual assistance," but also this point was particularly noteworthy during the Diet's questioning. The first questioner in the House of Peers, Viscount Watanabe Chifuyu (Research Group), began by asking Hayashi, "What is the government's fundamental policy on Sino-Japanese diplomacy?" Hayashi replied, "As I said in my foreign policy speech, it is to try to clarify Sino-Japanese relations." Later, Baron Sakatani Yoshiro of the Koseikai further questioned Hayashi, "Our country's continental policy is often misunderstood as invading foreign territory. For example, the Chinese people believe that Japan has invaded Manchuria and intends to invade North China. I remember that in the past, during the Sun Yat-sen revolution, he sought help from our country. The Chinese people greatly hoped for our country's help. However, recently, an anti-Japanese movement has swept across China, and national unity has been achieved through anti-Japanese sentiment. This proves that the true meaning of Japan's 'continental policy' has not been understood by China." However, Hayashi's reply was nothing more than, "Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, the amity of Japan, 'Manchukuo,' and China is our country's unshakeable policy. I believe that this is a 'necessary' thing for the Far East. In the future, we must strive to make the national feelings of the three countries harmonious, promote economic cooperation, and strive to make China fully understand our country's true intentions."

Next, in the House of Representatives, Seiyukai representative Uehara Etsujiro raised the issue of the unification of diplomacy in his questioning on foreign policy. "Prime Minister Hayashi's statement on the establishment and unification of diplomatic policy deserves our full respect. There are many reasons for the complete collapse of the Hirota Cabinet's diplomacy, but the main ones are nothing more than secret diplomacy and bureaucratic self-righteousness. In order to establish diplomatic policy, does Prime Minister Hayashi have the determination to break the secret diplomacy? As far as the unification of diplomacy is concerned, diplomacy is the exclusive responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Does Prime Minister Hayashi have the awareness to sweep away the evils of the Hirota Cabinet at that time? Next, as far as the national policy of diplomacy is concerned, diplomacy is different from domestic affairs and does not change with changes in the cabinet. This seat believes that there are four important things in the implementation of the national policy of diplomacy: first, the establishment of a policy towards Manchuria; second, the adjustment of Japan-Soviet relations; third, the strengthening of good neighborly relations between China and Japan; fourth, anti-communist work in the Far East." Uehara then specifically raised five points regarding China policy for questioning, "In terms of strengthening good neighborly relations between China and Japan: first, our country should clearly announce to the world that our country is not a militaristic country and has no territorial ambitions; second, we should have a correct understanding of the current new nationalistic ideology and national movement surging throughout China; third, we should make the Chinese and Japanese people realize that they must truly become nations of coexistence and co-prosperity. Under this psychological state, we should launch diplomatic work between the two countries; fourth, the thoroughness of anti-communist work; fifth, Sino-Japanese cooperation should first be based on economic policy. What are Prime Minister Hayashi's views on the above points?" Hayashi's reply was quite simple. "The current diplomatic policy is aimed at ensuring that there are no regrets in all aspects. My intention is the same on the issue of 'Manchuria.' I feel the same way about relations with China and the Soviet Union" (At this time, there was loud laughter and shouts of "What is this?"). Uehara retook the stage and asked further, but he clearly had no intention of attacking. He only said, "The diplomatic policy has been heard. The question is how to implement it. I hope you will explain more clearly about the implementation plan for the unification of diplomacy." Hayashi used his usual evasive tactics. He did not directly answer the last point, but only said, "Regarding breaking the so-called secret diplomacy, preparations have been made. National diplomacy has not been forgotten."

From these questions and answers, we can clearly see that: ㊀ The root cause of the Chinese people's animosity towards Japan lies in Japan, which is their common understanding. ㊁ If this root cause is not removed, the impression of aggression against China cannot be eliminated. Without eliminating this impression, diplomacy between China and Japan cannot be launched, which is also what they do not hesitate to say. ㊂ The need for the unification of Japanese diplomacy is highly valued by the Diet, but Hayashi did not have the confidence to answer it. ㊃ Despite Hayashi's unsatisfactory answers, the Diet did not have the determination to pursue the matter. Both political parties in the House of Representatives feared dissolution and tried to avoid the possibility of conflict as much as possible. This was also very evident in the following two questions:

㊁ The Issue of Fascistization and the Failure of the Ugaki Cabinet: Regarding the issue of fascistization, the House of Representatives did not raise it this time. Only Viscount Watanabe of the House of Peers asked after questioning China policy, "What does the government believe about fascist authoritarian politics?" Hayashi replied, "Regarding the form of constitutional politics, we have not thought of importing foreign ideas as they are. We hope to implement politics in accordance with our country's unique constitution established by the emperor."

Koizumi Matajiro, a member of the House of Representatives from the Democratic Party, did not explicitly point out the issue of fascistization, but asked Hayashi, "Since everyone agrees that we should govern in accordance with the constitution, why did Prime Minister Hayashi specifically mention it and add the word 'unique'? Does it have a special meaning?" Hayashi replied, "I only hope to operate in accordance with the spirit of the constitution established by the emperor, which is based on our country's unparalleled national polity. I have no other intention." If further questioning were added here, there would of course be more doubts to ask. Not only was Hayashi's answer not clear, but it could even be said to have made the problem more complicated. However, aside from laughing and saying, "Why do we need you to explain this?", they did not go any further. They tacitly agreed that the use of the phrase "unique constitution" was valid.

Closely related to this issue is the fact that Hayashi insisted that party members not declare their party affiliation in order to join the cabinet when he formed his cabinet this time, which in effect denied the parties the qualification to participate in the government. Under the current situation where political parties still exist, and especially after political parties have not only participated in the cabinet but also organized cabinets for more than a decade, it is of course impossible not to forcefully attack this. However, regarding this point, only Koizumi lamented the political parties' "sacrifice of life, bankruptcy, sincerity, and contribution to the development of constitutionalism" in the early Meiji era, and briefly asked what reason Hayashi had for requiring people who wanted to join the cabinet to leave their parties. Aside from that, almost no one dared to ask further, and Hayashi's answer to this question was as simple as possible. "Because I don't think there was a need to invite political parties to join the cabinet under the circumstances at that time." (To be continued)

### Overview of the Beijing Municipal Government's Work in the Past Two Years

Report by Chen Jianru, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs

Beijing News: The Beijing Municipal Government held a memorial week for the Premier at 8:00 AM yesterday. All employees attended. Director Chen Jianru of the Bureau of Social Affairs chaired the meeting. After leading the ceremony, he delivered a report on the overview of the municipal government's work in the past two years and the issues that should be noted in promoting municipal administration in the future. He stated that since Mayor Ma took office, it has been almost two years. This time, the central government held the Third Plenary Session, and the Secretariat of the Municipal Government specially compiled an overview of the work in the past two years and submitted it to the conference for review. We will try to review the work in the past two years. The construction of all parties has made considerable progress in terms of both quality and quantity. However, it is still far from our ideal, and we still need to continue our efforts in the future. However, any construction takes funding as a prerequisite. Nanjing has barren land and poor people. The municipal fiscal revenue is less than that of other major cities. It is only enough to make ends meet. Even daily expenses are not enough. Not to mention bearing the huge construction costs of various projects. Therefore, the biggest problem in the future is how to increase municipal fiscal revenue. If this basic problem cannot be solved, then various construction plans will not be realized, and it will be difficult to expect the rapid progress of municipal administration. Mayor Ma believes that Nanjing is the capital, and various construction projects cannot be stopped. Therefore, the budget has been increased year after year. All I hope is that Nanjing can be built into a modern city in a short period of time. However, the general public does not understand the principles of municipal administration and believes that the municipal government's expansion of the budget violates the principle of measuring people's needs as an output. They do not know that to build a new city, this conservative concept should be broken. Therefore, although our budget has expanded year after year, the shortfall should be solved by other means. Or, following the precedent of various cities, issuing construction bonds or requesting the central government to increase subsidies to promote the construction of the capital. Nanjing is the capital of the country. The construction costs are borne by the people of Nanjing alone. Not only is it beyond the city's ability, but it is also unfair. As for the method of controlling finance, all money should be used in the most needed, economical, and effective places. The municipal government specially imitated the method of Qingdao City last year and established a Management Committee. The purpose is to obtain appropriate control, so as to obtain the maximum effect with the least amount of money. In addition, the organs related to finance, such as the Bureau of Finance, the Municipal Bank, the Municipal Treasury, the Management Committee, the Audit Department, and the Office stationed in the government, should obtain close contact to reduce the time spent on public documents and increase the efficiency of work. Finally, in terms of personnel, we should also try to adjust it. Under the leadership of the mayor, all parties should work together regardless of each other. At the same time, all employees should automatically work hard to promote municipal administration. The mother is waiting for the supervisors to reluctantly engage in each person's conscience and serve the country and society for the entire people of the city. Externally, we should make the people of the city understand the content of all the laws and regulations of the municipal government and the meaning of all the facilities, and implement them as a whole. Now we feel that we lack correct public opinion. Even if there is so-called social opinion, it is the private opinion of a few people, that is, there are other functions. Therefore, we sincerely hope that there will be correct public opinion for our reference and to improve our qualifications. Mayor Ma repeatedly instructed us to study and contribute opinions on the cloth administration at any time for selection. Therefore, I specially put forward the above-mentioned issues, hoping that colleagues will study and contribute more to the mayor in order to collect ideas and benefit from it."

### Songjiang

Injured Thief Escapes from Hospital

Last month, the Songjiang Waterfront Provincial Police Team captured a bandit named Shen Langen in Shengziting, Punan. Because the bandit often tried to escape, the police fired a shot and wounded him. After being taken to the team and briefly interrogated, he was sent to the procuratorate for interrogation. He was sent to Songjiang Hospital for treatment due to his injuries. When the doctor's treatment was about to heal him, he suddenly escaped over the wall in the morning of the 24th, taking advantage of the guard's negligence. The hospital has sent letters to the army and military organs to search and arrest him.

### Suzhou

The resolution was passed and submitted to the Provincial Federation of Commerce for efforts to fight for it. ㊄ The silk and satin industry requested that the Ministry of Finance be notified to express its support for the implementation of income tax and request the abolition of business tax. The resolution was passed and appealed to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to express their support for the implementation of income tax, and at the same time, a clear order was issued to abolish business tax. One side submitted it to the Provincial Federation of Commerce and requested a unanimous proposal. ㊅ The silk edge industry proposed to request the government to actively promote the silkworm and mulberry industry in order to make rural by-products. The resolution was passed. ㊆ The lime, brick, and tile industry proposed to request that the county government be transferred to the county government for the teeth tax collection officers to have knowledge of commercial conditions, and should not force ordinary merchants to pay the teeth tax in order to sympathize with merchants' difficulties. According to the decision, the county government should be transferred to instruct the teeth tax to collect the records of the officials, and properly handle the mother, and shall not arrest the merchants and people in a hurry to avoid disturbances. ㊇ The iron machinery silk weaving industry presented a request to the government to set up an artificial silk manufacturing plant as soon as possible. Before it can be made domestically, the import tax rate should be reduced slightly to maintain the work plan. The resolution was passed. ㊈ Should the association set up an accounting training class to create specialized talents? The resolution was handed over to the Executive Committee for handling.

### Changshu

Replacement of Two District Chiefs in the County Office

Zheng Zhenyong, the chief of the 11th district under the county, was previously arrested for harboring prostitutes in the countryside. The case is still pending in the county judiciary. Considering Zheng's lack of public trust, the county magistrate has ordered his replacement. The vacancy will be filled by Pan Zhengfen, the assistant of the 1st district. Additionally, Zhang Jie, the chief of the 7th district, has been approved to resign. The vacancy will be filled by Mu Lianshi, the assistant.

### Wuxi

Strengthening the County's Defenses

Zhang Da, the police chief of the county, stated that the police district system has been established and will be perfected after the completion of the organization. In the 26th year, the police force will be reinforced to strengthen defenses. More than 30 police stations will be added, and 11 bunkers will be built. To prevent riots and eliminate traitors, 26 patrol boats will be added, 26 wireless telephone stations will be installed, and 100 wooden-shell rifles with 20,000 rounds of ammunition and 190 broadswords will be purchased. The budget for household registration in the police district is set at 8,000 yuan, and 50 motorcycles and 4 motorized bicycles will be added.

Estimating Land Prices in the Urban Area

Ma Yulin, a specialist dispatched by the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, came to Wuxi to estimate land prices in preparation for levying land value tax in the future. After arriving in Wuxi, Ma began the assessment in the central and western districts, including areas such as North Street, Guangfu Gate, Chong'an Temple, and Dashi Bridge, where the price is about 10,000 yuan per mu. The South Gate, East Gate, and West Gate areas range from 2,000 to 5,000 yuan. The South Gate school field is the lowest, about 1,000 yuan per mu. The land price estimation committee will review and make a final decision. In the future, the tax standard for the urban area will be 6 per thousand based on land price, and the rural area will be 10 per thousand. The land price estimation for all rural areas in the county is scheduled to be completed by June.

### Yangzhou

Centuries-Old Candle and Charcoal Shop Ceases Operation

In the candle and charcoal industry in Yangzhou, Dasheng at Yuanmen Bridge and Ledemao at Dadongmen are the most famous, both with over a century of operation. Ledemao, which was about to close its doors, had Detai Candle and Charcoal Shop as a branch, renamed Detai Mao. Their businesses were flourishing, and they hired Ningbo workers to make candles. The candle flowers were famous for their self-flying. Unfortunately, Liang Ding, the manager of Ledemao, died suddenly last December 28th (February 9th). The news was kept secret, and his body was sent back to Zhouwei. Now, the business is declared bankrupt. It is said that the price of candle oil rose to more than 30 yuan per dan, making the cost too high and the turnover difficult. Accumulated debts of 8,000 yuan could not be paid, so the business was temporarily suspended. The current economic downturn is evident here.

### Jiaxing

Request to Abolish Advertising Tax

The Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce believes that the advertising tax is excessive and miscellaneous. Any commercial advertisement must first pay the tax. Although the cost is not too high, the process of paying the tax and getting a stamp involves many procedures and takes time. Even for domestic product advertisements that do not require tax payment, it is still necessary to ask the government to stamp a tax-exempt mark before they can be received and posted. Such complications hinder commercial promotion. Therefore, on the 24th, the chamber requested the provincial government to issue an order to abolish the advertising tax in the province to benefit commerce.

### Jiashan

Ship Office Extorts Steamships

The Zhejiang Provincial Ship Office is harassing the people and causing resentment. It has been ordered to be abolished by the provincial chairman, Zhu Jiahua. However, Huang Xirong, the director of the Second District Ship Office, upon hearing the news of the abolition, secretly sent his staff to various ports to forcibly collect employment fees from the shipping lines, 10 yuan per barge and 100 yuan per steamship. A ferry of the Gongxing Shipping Company from Fengjing to Jiaxing was suddenly detained in an attempt to extort money. As of today, it has not been released.

### Chinese Youth Basketball Bank Group Championship Belongs to Domestic Products

This year, the number of participants in the Chinese Youth Basketball League is exceptionally enthusiastic, so each group, except for the bank group, the other school and commercial groups are divided into sub-groups to simplify the process. Unfortunately, the strength of the participating teams is uneven due to the limitation of not participating in other leagues, but the spirit is excellent, and there have been no problems. Since the start of the competition, except for the women's group, which has not yet started, the bank group is about to end. The business group has also completed two-thirds of the schedule. The school group started later, and only competes on Saturdays, so it is still in the early stages, and the situation is difficult to predict. In the bank group, the strongest teams are Guohuo and Shanghai. Guohuo still has a match against Qianku, while Shanghai has completed its tasks. Guohuo has won four games and the championship is in its grasp. Shanghai unfortunately lost once and finished second. The rankings of other teams are also largely determined. Jiangxing is undoubtedly the fourth place. As for the business group, except for Business Group 2 and Business Group 3, the championship of the other Business Group 1 and Business Group 4 is difficult to predict. The current status of each group is listed below to get an overview. However, the school group is not included because the competition has not been underway for long.

### Industry and Commerce Soccer God Group Jindeg and Chang Geng Final

Scheduled for Sunday Morning at 10 AM

Held at the City First Sports Field

After the Jindeg and Changgeng teams won the championships of the first and second divisions of the 8th Industry and Commerce Cup Soccer "God" group, they had a final on the 14th of this month. However, because the main player of the Jindeg team traveled south, they only fought with members of the second division team. As a result, the score was 0-0, with no winner. The game was extended for 20 minutes, but there was still no result. It was then scheduled to be replayed on the 21st of this month, but was blocked by rain. It was then postponed to 10 AM this Sunday (28th) at the Nanshi First Sports Field. Now, the main players of the Jindeg team, such as Xu Jingcheng and Xu Buyun, have returned north, and hopes are high.

Registration Deadline is Next Month 14th

The 5th small football competition organized by the Sports Committee of the Pudong YMCA has been scheduled to start registration from the 24th of this month, with a deadline of January 14th. This year, only adult groups will be accepted, limited to 30 teams. The most important aspect of the competition is discipline. Those who are arrogant and despise sportsmanship will be severely punished. It is hoped that the registered teams will carefully consider this to avoid future troubles. Furthermore, the association's planned 2nd Children's Games will also be held on March 14th. Prizes are currently being collected separately. This sports event has aroused strong interest in Pudong, and this year, a women's group has been added, making the competition more interesting than last year.

### Tomorrow and the Day After Tomorrow's West League Schedule

Referees Arranged for Each Field

The West League football group has reached the final critical moment. The French Commercial Team is at the top and is recognized as the most promising contender for the championship. However, the soul of the French Commercial Team, Xiao Huater, has not returned from Hong Kong, reducing the prospects of brightness. The outcome of tomorrow's battle against the Lau Ee El team will increase the risk. Even a single loss is not enough to affect the throne of the French Commercial Team. How can they know that they will not encounter misfortune again in the future? With the prosperity of the French Commercial Team this year, it is natural to maintain a constant victory. The honor of the inter-port competition is also the honor of the team. Unexpectedly, because of this, they lost the main player, causing the risk of losing the league championship. The changes in football are impermanent and intriguing.

French Commercial vs. Lau Ee El Group A Saturday at Yiyuan Botuo (Linesmen: Aqiaosheng, Naiaide)

Lux vs. Jinan Group A Saturday at Jiaozhou Park Zhang Le

Jewish vs. Jindeh Society Morning League Sunday at Hongkou Park Tan Xi

### Supervision Office of Students Studying in Japan Dissolves the Student Union

Surrounding the Embassy to Make Demands and Force a Commitment

(Tokyo Dispatch) The number of Chinese students studying in Japan was close to 10,000 at the end of the year before last, exceeding the highest record in the past ten years. Later, due to various relations with the country, the number gradually decreased, and now it is only about 5,000 or 6,000. In addition to about 700 people scattered throughout Japan, the rest are concentrated in a corner of Tokyo. Most students are able to study hard, but there are also many young students who are indecisive and inevitably exploited. Their thinking tends to be radicalized and their actions go beyond the norm. In October of last year, the "Chinese Student Union in Japan" was established in Tokyo, being the largest of the 130 or so organizations organized by students in Tokyo. At the beginning of the establishment of the association, it was still able to seek benefits for the majority of students without study certificates, repeatedly appealing to the supervision office to cancel the qualification restrictions, and uniformly give graduates who returned home graduation certificates, so that the qualifications of several years of schooling would not be denied by the government. This kind of appeal was quite supported by the majority of students. Following this, the association's future was full of hope. Unfortunately, on February 14, when another so-called "Chinese Student Association in Japan" held its establishment meeting at the Japan-China Association in Kanda District, the students of the Union believed that they were illegal organizations destroying the unified front of the study abroad community. People were sent in advance to occupy the meeting place, so that it could not be held. The two sides faced off and clashed, and a bloody tragedy occurred. Fortunately, there were not many injuries, and the injuries were not serious. On the same day, the crowd was dispersed by the Japanese police. Then, the Union gathered two or three hundred people again and went to the embassy to petition, surrounding Ambassador Xu and Supervisor Chen, putting forward various demands and forcing a commitment. The next day, many newspapers in Tokyo recorded it, such as the Asahi Shimbun, which was headlined "Xi'an Incident? The Chinese Embassy is Surrounded," and attached photos. The Hochi Shimbun was headlined "The Ugly Behavior of Chinese Students," etc., which seemed to be related to the reputation of the country and the dignity of the students. Students who cherished their reputation and loved their country were very disapproving. The embassy's supervision office has also based on reports from various sources that the Student Union is inevitably colored behind the scenes. Supervisor Chen resolutely ordered its dissolution on the 16th, and did not allow the association to continue its activities. Some students believed that the supervision office's resolute measures were too close to high pressure and spoke up for the Student Union. It has been heard that there are demands to dissolve the student association, but some students believe that the association's actions and remarks have unstable evidence. If they are not dissolved early, they may be deeply rooted and difficult to clean up in the future. However, whether the Student Union will completely accept the supervision office's order and stop activities is a question. If there is really a background, the future direction is worthy of attention. (Central News Agency)

### The Problem of Literacy Education for Rickshaw Pullers

Rickshaw Guild Letter to the Mutual Aid Association

3,000 Yuan Monthly for Independent Organization

The Rickshaw Guild of the Special District, regarding the issue of literacy education for rickshaw pullers, this morning sent a letter to the directors of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, requesting an expansion of the budget. The original letter is transcribed below: Respected Sirs, We have recently received Instruction No. 3610 from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, which states: "Upon investigation, the one-year plan for literacy education for rickshaw pullers in this city has been submitted to and approved by the Municipal Government with Instruction No. 22592. In addition to complying with the eighth provision of the plan, we have sent a letter to the Bureau of Finance, stipulating that all public rickshaws applying for licenses must submit a receipt from the Shanghai Bank as proof of payment before the license can be issued. This order must be followed. Furthermore, the original plan was intended to be implemented from February, but this is no longer feasible and should be changed to March 1 of this year. This order must also be followed." It is to be noted that rickshaw puller literacy education was originally one of the welfare undertakings of your association. The expenses for the rickshaw puller welfare undertakings undertaken by your association, which our members bear, are already collected by the Public Works Department with the license fee, amounting to a huge sum of one yuan and five jiao per vehicle per month. Adding tax on top of the fee, and with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs instructing that the expenses for rickshaw puller literacy education be three jiao per vehicle, rickshaw operators will inevitably go bankrupt and be unable to operate. Now, in order to comply with the order, promote rickshaw puller literacy welfare, and maintain the business of rickshaw operators, we respectfully request that your association, starting from March 1, expand the education and welfare budget to 3,000 yuan per month and separately hire experts to independently organize a Rickshaw Puller Literacy Education Committee in cooperation with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to jointly handle literacy welfare matters for rickshaw pullers throughout the city. This matter concerns government orders, the promotion of rickshaw puller literacy welfare, and the maintenance of rickshaw operator businesses. We respectfully hope for your approval and reply.

### Overview of Shanghai Experimental Primary School (3)

Special Report by This Newspaper, Investigation by Hu Zuyin

3. Administrative Facilities

(1) Administrative Organization: The administrative organization of the school is based on the "Organizational Regulations for Experimental Primary Schools" promulgated by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, with some modifications. The principal is fully responsible for all school affairs. Under the principal, there are the General Affairs Department, the Teaching Department, the Research Department, and special committees, which are responsible for handling various matters under their jurisdiction. Each department is further divided into several sections to assist in handling departmental affairs. In addition, there are three divisions, namely the First, Second, and Third Divisions, which are subordinate to the General Affairs, Teaching, and Research Departments, respectively, to handle the teaching and experimental research matters of each division. Each division is further divided into several groups to assist in handling divisional affairs. Major matters in the school are decided by the school affairs meeting; during the period when the school affairs meeting is suspended, its powers are exercised by the administrative committee.

(2) Grade System: The First Division of the school has one class each for kindergarten, first grade, second grade, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade, and sixth grade; the Third Division has one class each for single grade, first and second grade combined, third and fourth grade combined, and two classes each for fifth grade and sixth grade, totaling fourteen classes. These fourteen classes are the ordinary grade system, and they all start in the autumn. As for experimental subjects, students are grouped separately according to their intelligence and academic ability. The Second Division has six extension classes, with one class each for second grade, third grade, fourth grade, and fifth grade, and two classes for sixth grade. All subjects are the same as those in ordinary schools. The establishment of extension classes is to show the meaning of assisting in the implementation of compulsory education. In the autumn of the 25th year, the school had a total of 1,008 students, including 723 boys and 285 girls.

(3) Revenue and Expenditure: The school receives an annual recurrent expenditure of 23,560 yuan from the provincial treasury to operate fourteen classes, including 1,500 yuan for operating expenses, which is stipulated to be used for experimental research and promotion. School fees are waived according to the orders of the department. Miscellaneous fees and material fees generate an annual income of approximately 1,200 yuan, which is used to purchase children's library books, labor materials, and sports supplies. The six extension classes in the Second Division do not receive provincial funding and use the approximately 2,500 yuan received from book fees, miscellaneous fees, and material fees to offset salaries, office expenses, and other expenses. The total construction cost of the new school building in Wujia Lane is approximately 47,000 yuan. In addition to the 5,500 yuan of temporary funding allocated by the provincial treasury, the remaining amount was completed by the economic assistance obtained by the school's faculty and staff through the implementation of the new Five-Year Construction Plan (to be introduced later).

### Yarn and Cotton

Outflow of Yarn from Warehouses Leads to Reaction in the Yarn Market

Mainly Due to Large Price Difference Between Futures and Spot

Active Spot Sales Trigger Short Covering

Nearly Reaching the 40 Yuan Level This Month

Rumor of Shorts Covering at a Premium This Month

The yarn market, which had fallen for three consecutive days, turned upward yesterday. This was because the price of the March futures yarn was 10 yuan higher than the spot price. Currently, the factory has limited yarn in stock, and all spot goods are mostly concentrated in yarn and cloth warehouses. Indian merchants are reportedly buying a large amount of spot yarn and trying to sell it in the market. It is said that the longs are willing to pay the shorts a premium of 5.6 yuan based on the March futures yarn price to take back the goods. As a result, market sentiment turned bullish. At the same time, spot sales were active, with more than 2,000 bales of yarn sold from the warehouses. In the afternoon, market prices continued to rise.

Futures Yarn Rises by 2.8 Yuan

Futures yarn opened higher across all months in the morning. The sharp decline in the past three days triggered short covering by those who had profited. At the same time, 1,000 bales of yarn were sold, and 870 bales were sold from the warehouses. As a result, market sentiment improved slightly compared to the previous day. However, most people still had a bearish outlook and sold on rallies, as inventory levels are expected to gradually increase. Yarn mills are operating at full capacity, and production has increased significantly compared to before. However, prices have already fallen sharply, and there may be some room for a rebound of a few yuan. The futures yarn price nearly reached the 40 yuan level again this month. As a result, the closing prices for all months were 1.3-1.9 jiao higher than the closing prices of the previous day. Market conditions remained stable after the afternoon opening. Due to good news, the longs were trying to sell the chips they had bought. Spot sales were good, with buyers purchasing more than 3,300 bales of spot yarn, including 2,020 bales from the warehouses. Also, with the settlement to be held tomorrow, retail investors were eager to roll over to avoid risks. Market prices advanced slowly. As a result, the closing prices for all months were another 8-9 jiao to 1 yuan higher than the morning closing prices. According to investigations, Dafu sold 6,200 bales, Hengyi 1,350 bales, Dafeng 3,500 bales, Gengfeng 2,700 bales, Yongchang 950 bales, Yukang 950 bales, Mingde 1,350 bales, Changji 1,250 bales, Taichang 3,250 bales, and Changfeng 2,600 bales. Hengchang bought 1,100 bales, Yuanyi 900 bales, Jifeng 2,750 bales, Hexing 2,800 bales, Changyu 1,350 bales, Yutai 4,150 bales, Wang Taixing 1,550 bales, and Runkang 3,650 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

Yarn Sales Reach 3,300 Bales

Spot yarn sales have improved. Merchants from Tianjin, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other inland areas have suddenly become active. More than 2,000 bales of yarn in warehouses have been bought up, leading to a rise in the futures market. According to statistics, a total of 3,347 bales of spot yarn, including warehouse yarn, were purchased by various merchants throughout the day. The selling price was similar to that of the previous day. The amount of purchases by various merchants is listed below.

Yarn Market Recovers, Cotton Covers Shorts and Rises

At the Same Time, American Cotton Also Continues to Rise

However, Local Inventories are Still Ample

Industry Sentiment Remains Bearish

The cotton market has strengthened due to the continued rise in American cotton and the recovery of the yarn market, which has stabilized market sentiment. Short covering activity has caused the market to trend higher. However, industry sentiment remains bearish. At the same time, demand for spot cotton from factories is weak, and local inventories are still ample.

Futures Cotton Rises by 2-3 Jiao

Futures cotton opened higher across all months in the morning due to the continued rise in American cotton. Market momentum was stable. However, Indian cotton was mediocre, and local inventories were high. Therefore, most people had a bearish outlook. However, the sharp decline in the past two days triggered short covering and strengthening. As a result, the closing prices for all months were 2.5 jiao higher than the closing prices of the previous day. Market conditions became tighter after the afternoon opening. The rise in the yarn market boosted the cotton market. However, spot cotton transactions were not active, and industry pressure to sell short was heavy. As a result, the near-month contract rose another 1.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price, while the far-month contract remained unchanged. According to investigations, Yuda sold 9,800 dan, Shenda 2,500 dan, Dachangcheng 1,000 dan, Changhe 1,700 dan, Hengyi 2,300 dan, Dafeng 1,700 dan, Yicheng 3,300 dan, Taichang 2,300 dan, Fukang 1,300 dan, and Xinchang 2,500 dan. Dafu bought 3,000 dan, Jifeng 3,100 dan, Hexing 1,700 dan, Yuanda 1,300 dan, Gengfeng 2,100 dan, Changyu 2,300 dan, Fengtai 3,700 dan, Renfeng 1,300 dan, and Runkang 9,700 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

Spot Cotton Still Shows No Improvement

Spot cotton consumption is mediocre, factory demand is weak, and sources have not been found.

American Cotton Merchants Buy March Contracts

American cotton opened yesterday with good news from Liverpool. Liverpool merchants bought, and prices rose by 2-5 British pounds across all months. Industry brokers saw only three delivery notices issued and believed that the spot cotton situation was firm, so they bought March contracts. Regarding the situation of foreign currency systems, market sentiment was mixed, and there was a lack of large-scale short-selling in the market, which was worth paying attention to. Private estimates of pledged cotton sales reached approximately 620,000 bales. After that, market conditions became more active, and new cotton spot merchants sold. Closing was stable, with spot prices rising by 10 British pounds and futures prices rising by 2-12 British pounds. English cotton spot prices rose by 3 points, and futures prices rose by 3-4 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by European exporters, but then weakened due to the stock market downturn. Finally, due to purchases by the public, short covering, and good news from Liverpool, the market rose again, with Pingguoer rising by 0.25 rupees, Aomula rising by 0.25-0.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rising by 0.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (24th telegram).

According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 25th was Bailuoxi at 223.5 rupees, Aomula at 206.5 rupees, and Pingguoer at 181 rupees, all rising by 1.25 rupees.

Osaka Spot Yarn Plunges by 10 Yuan

Sanhin Cotton Yarn Sees an Increase

Osaka, 25th Telegram: Spot yarn fell by 4-10 yuan. 16-count fan-shaped yarn was 229 yuan, and 20-count goldfish yarn was 249 yuan, both down 4 yuan. 40-count five-star yarn was 380 yuan, down 10 yuan. 42-count pheasant yarn was 370 yuan, down 5 yuan.

Futures cotton rose by 0.35-0.55 yuan, with the near-month contract at 74.4 yuan and the far-month contract at 75.7 yuan.

### Securities

Public Bonds Have Shifted According to Supply and Demand

Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, April futures began trading. Initially, market sentiment was quite good, with Jinzi merchants showing considerable interest. Later, Company No. 35 sold on behalf of a certain bank, with a steady stream of selling. It was rumored that there were still large batches of spot goods of types A and B being settled, which caused market sentiment to turn downward. Finally, No. 5 entered and then exited, greatly discouraging market sentiment. Market conditions rose first and then fell, with a difference of more than one yuan in a single day. There was no other news in the environment. The situation on the floor was completely dull and declining. Because it was a matter of supply and demand of chips, the downward trend in the future is probably not over yet. Because there were many longs during the previous two months of rolling, there were originally many longs in March. Market changes are probably still wanting to come out. Yesterday's events: At the morning opening, No. 5 bought in, reportedly representing Jinzi merchants. However, No. 35, representing the financial sector, continued to sell, and No. 50 also sold a lot. The market price initially rose very sharply. This month's type C rose sharply by 0.5 jiao. After that, types A and B still showed no improvement, and the trend changed sharply. Thieving only gave type E a good 0.1 jiao, and the rest gradually turned weak, returning a small 0.1 to 0.3 jiao. After the afternoon opening, Nos. 3, 34, 35, and 77 all sold, and No. 11 also sold a lot. The situation was already sluggish, and spot goods seemed to be selling, so the market price unanimously continued to decrease by a small 0.1 to 0.35 jiao. At the closing, Nos. 32, 35, and 58 continued to sell, and No. 5 even turned to selling. The situation felt completely sluggish, decreasing by another 0.2 to 0.65 jiao. As a result, the March contracts all decreased by a uniform 0.25 to 0.65 jiao, except for the newly opened April contracts, which are not counted. The total transaction volume was 8.94 million yuan. The results of its increase and decrease are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

There was a fluctuation of only 0.2 jiao throughout the day. As a result, it closed up 0.2 jiao from the previous close.

The settlement price, due to the Central Bank's list price for the standard gold price rising to 1,156.4 yuan, was approximately less than 1 yuan based on the closing price. The spot market situation was stable. The selling price of raw gold was 15.5 yuan, and the buying price was 12 yuan. Tianjin goods were quoted at an additional 14 yuan, but there were no transactions. Regarding swaps, because shorts needed to pay a premium of 0.2 jiao yesterday, all parties were still watching and lacked counterparty transactions.

There was limited trading within the exchange. In summary, Dacheng, Fu, Minyong, Dadecheng, and Yuanmaoyong bought in slightly. Dadecheng, Qingfayong, Qiafengyong, Shengyuanyong, and Qianchangxiang sold slightly. There were 1,925 March forwards left, with a total of six long parties and twelve short parties.

Banks and Mobil Settled Foreign Exchange

Although Chinese and Foreign Firms Were Selling

The US Exchange Rate Remained Slightly Tight

After opening, HSBC's list prices for the UK and the US remained flat, and the silver balance tax was down 0.025, which was extremely stable. This was mainly due to interbank trading, with Chinese merchants selling the UK and buying Japan, but both were maintained by banks. Later, although Sassoon sold shillings, banks bought on the cheap, and the overall trend remained stable. However, the near-term slightly showed signs of weakness. But Mobil settled US dollars, slightly flattening the market at noon. In the afternoon, Xinfeng and Sassoon continued to sell shillings, and banks absorbed a lot. Near-term US dollars were also bought in. The closing was still tight, with the closing selling prices for the near-term British exchange rate at 1 shilling 2.5625 and 59175 pence, and US dollars at 29.6875 yuan, which was flat for the UK and down 0.03125 for the US compared to the previous close.

### Piece Goods

Heavyweight coarse cloth is the most sought after

March and April futures have already sold out

Other fabrics do not sell well

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was affected by the continuous sharp drop in yarn and flower prices. Customers were watching and waiting, and unanimously slowed down their operations. The market was weak and prices gradually declined. The morning market continued the previous day's decline, and prices were reported to have fallen again. Eastern-made white goods and fine cloth had the largest sales volume, and the changes were also faster than other goods. The morning market price fell by 5 to 10 cents. Qingdao goods remained firm due to the lack of loosening in the producing area. Local fine cloth and fine twill also fell by 2.5 to 5 cents. Eastern goods, the "Four Gentlemen" serge, once fell to 25.5 cents per yard. Local Zhigong, serge, and crepe also fell by about 5 li. However, after the entry of standard yarn, the market rebounded and sentiment improved. Eastern fine cloth quickly covered short positions, and prices gradually rebounded. As a result, Eastern fine cloth and fine twill fluctuated very little compared to the previous day's market. Colored "Four Gentlemen" serge also rebounded by about 2.5 li. Local colored goods also stabilized. Transactions in all directions were light. Only the local street and the Qingdao and Tianjin gangs purchased more than 500 pieces of Eastern fine cloth and fine twill, which was a relatively large amount. The military uniform gangs successively absorbed nearly 10,000 pieces of heavyweight coarse cloth. The March and April goods of various factories have recently sold out, so the heavyweight coarse cloth market is the most firm and popular.

Western-style woolen cloth sells very well

Sichuan and Hunan gangs are already preparing for summer goods

Western-style fancy woolen cloth sold briskly in the market yesterday. Local customer gangs have wide outlets. Durable呢, 火姆四本條格, spring light fancy呢, 啥味羅四呢, 板絲呢, five-color呢, etc. have been purchased in large quantities by local and foreign tailors. Medium-thick serge and Hanlimeng also sell well. Customers from Beijing, Hangzhou, Tianjin, and Hankou have successively arrived in Shanghai to purchase goods. Chongqing, Chengdu, and Changsha gangs stationed in Shanghai are also preparing goods together. Furthermore, due to the long distance and the time required for transportation, there is also demand for summer goods. The trend of both domestic and foreign goods is good, and standard market prices are mostly firm. The arrival and sales of Japanese goods are more than last year.

Yuanfang Auction House holds a red盘 auction

—Market prices are falling, not rising—

Yesterday was the 3,026th auction of Yuanfang 洋行, which was for spring red盘 goods. Five types of goods were displayed: Western satin, 元絨, Zhigong呢, 羽綢, and foreign red cloth, totaling 37 brands and 57 boxes. The prices of the five brands of Western satin auctioned were all lower than the previous period. Zhigong呢 was average. 元絨 Nine brands fell by 3 cents per yard. 羽綢 Twenty-seven brands were auctioned, and the prices of the goods fell instead of rising. Zhulin brand fell by $2.30, 彩八士, 燕國公, 鸞鳳花燭, 惟妙賞中秋, and 蝶仙九連燈 eight brands each fell by $1, and the rest fell by a small number of cents. Only the Donghua brand was average. Foreign red cloth was a heavyweight type that had not been listed for a long time, and the industry competed to purchase it, so the price was strong. The next auction will include Longfei brand 元府綢, 惟妙 White 洋紗, and 十八子 White bleached cloth.

### Grains

Miscellaneous grain transactions are particularly sluggish on the Lantern Festival

Foreign firm sesame seeds also appear depressed

Yesterday was the Lantern Festival, and the local exchange and the Dalian Exchange were closed for one day, causing the spot market to also see a sharp decline in transactions. The total market volume was 2,400 bags of soybeans, 50 bags of sesame seeds, 100 bags of green beans, 200 bags of broad beans, 50 bags of red beans, and 500 bags of red sorghum. Due to the weak overseas market, foreign firm sesame seeds also appeared depressed in Shanghai. It was heard yesterday that a telegram offer of $14.40 was made, but there was still no response from overseas, so the prospects may trend downward.

Thick粳 supply exceeds demand

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 vendors arrived from various gangs. Of these, more than 10 vendors were 薄稻. Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Xi'an, and other gangs only handled more than 1,000 packages of 包子, so the market situation was only stable. The supply of thick粳 exceeds demand, and it is weak by 5 cents. 杜尖 is average. 洋尖 is slightly soft. 陰兀 No significant difference.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, one or two vendors arrived from various roads along the river. Due to the Lantern Festival, there were few goods listed on the market, and the market's capacity was weaker than the previous market. The price of white 粳 of upper-middle quality was weak by several cents to nearly 10 cents. Lower quality was average. Early rice also showed a weak trend. 薄稻 was clearly priced but weak by 3 to 5 cents. 羊杜埠客尖 was average. 白元 was stable. The prices of other goods showed a weak trend.

### Silk and Tea

Foreign firms did not sell any silk all day

Yesterday, overseas silk markets, except for Lyon which remained stable, saw a consistent decline in silk prices in both Japan and the United States. The New York Exchange's standard silk fell by 2.5 cents for the near term and 3 cents for the deferred term. Japanese silk 83 degrees and 75 degrees, as well as Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk's holding prices, each fell by 3 cents. Yokohama spot prices fell by 5 yuan, and futures fell by 7 yuan. As a result, the Shanghai export silk market felt even more quiet, and no sales were seen all day. The Indian silk market was the same. Silk users were still only engaging in sporadic local transactions. Foreign customer gangs can be expected to trade a little in the future, as the Lantern Festival has passed and the local silk market will return to its normal state.

### The Silk Industry Last Year and the Understanding We Should Have Going Forward (Part 2)

— Zhu Xiaohe

Statistics on the Import, Inventory, and Consumption of Raw Silk in the UK and the US in the 25th Year (Units are bags, based on data published by the "Silk Association of America")

(2)

In the first half of the 25th year, the silk market in January and February was able to maintain a relatively firm market, thanks to the remaining momentum of the silk price surge at the end of the previous year. However, thereafter, the silk market gradually declined due to the expansion of silk stocks in New York and the decline in raw silk consumption. By the end of June, the average silk price in various countries had almost fallen to the lowest selling price of the year. At that time, before the cocoon harvest, Japanese silk was deliberately sold cheaply to suppress cocoon prices, and at the same time, news of a large amount of Italian silk being devalued and shipped to the United States for sale was gradually revealed, which made the silk market even weaker. The market situation was largely a feeling of oversupply. In terms of prices, New York spot prices fell from $1.8874 to $1.5463, Yokohama spot prices fell from 851.93 yuan to 684.34 yuan, Lyon Shanghai silk fell from 73.02 francs to 62.60 francs, London Hua silk fell from 7 shillings 11 pence to 6 shillings 2 pence, Shanghai silk market high-grade white factories fell from 955 yuan to 745 yuan, A-grade white factories fell from 915 yuan to 715 yuan, and B-grade fell from 845 yuan to 680 yuan. Other types of silk such as 雙宫輯里土絲 saw a slight increase due to the lack of Shanghai handmade goods. The above table can give a general idea of the state of the British and American silk industries before June. Looking at the statistics on raw silk exports from China and Japan over the past year, we can see that the silk industry last year matched the trend of the world economy, which first declined and then prospered. Starting in January in the first half of the year, the export volume of silk from both countries fell, taking the same path as market prices, and there was little sign of a turnaround. Before June, Japanese raw silk exports fell from 38,505 piculs in January to 26,416 piculs, the lowest picul amount of the year. The export quantity of Shanghai raw silk fell from 2,702 piculs in January to 1,237 piculs in February, and was only 1,619 piculs by the end of May, a decrease of 2,966 piculs compared to the average monthly export volume of the previous year.

Statistics on Raw Silk Exports from China and Japan in the 25th Year (Unit: Picul)

(3)

After June, the Chinese and foreign silk industries, in addition to the changing of old and new raw silk itself, the world's raw silk consumption gradually increased at that time, and market prices therefore rose. Also, there was still little new silk being produced, and the stock of silk gradually felt insufficient, and the silk market was clearly divided from before June. Moreover, at the beginning of July, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced that the year's Japanese silk production had been greatly reduced, and the expected cocoon collection amount was 39,498,990 관, a decrease of 16% compared with the previous year, second only to the lowest production amount of 39,477,160 관 in the 13th year of Taisho, a record of unprecedented poor harvest. As a result, the price of fresh Japanese cocoons rose to over 5.8 yuan, resulting in the anecdote that the reduced cocoon harvest actually increased the cocoon value by more than 40 million yuan. As a result, Yokohama silk prices surged, and after July, silk prices had broken through the 700 yuan mark, exceeding the 800 yuan mark again by the end of October, and had risen to 910 yuan by the end of December, the highest price of the year. In the Americas, after June, silk stocks in New York gradually decreased, and by the end of August, only 29,825 bags remained, which was less than the usual monthly need in the United States. Therefore, general speculators and textile merchants absorbed spot silk at high prices, and the number was huge, and the market chips became even more scarce. Moreover, due to the influence of Yokohama price increases, people's hearts became even more excited. Until the end of the US election, after Roosevelt returned to the White House, the American industry and commerce suddenly saw revitalization, and the monthly raw silk consumption quantity also exceeded the 40,000 bag level, and did not decline until the end of the year. At the same time, silk prices also maintained a record of over 2 US dollars per pound. In Europe, due to the sudden devaluation of the franc, prices rose one after another, and the silk market also rose rapidly. In early October, Lyon Hua silk A grade rose from 72 francs to 90.50 francs, B grade rose from 66 francs to 84 francs, and Japanese silk rose from 66 francs to 86 francs. After October, due to the successive price increases of Japanese and American silk, Hua silk A grade rose again to 98.50 francs, B grade rose to 95.50 francs, and Japanese silk rose to 103.50 francs, a total average increase of one-third. The overseas silk market in the second half of the year was as described above. Looking at the domestic situation again, since the Shanghai Incident in the 21st year, the entire silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has collapsed, and the rural economy in the sericulture area has also fallen into bankruptcy. At that time, the central government issued public bonds for relief, and in terms of fundamental solutions, it implemented a control policy. Over the past five years, it has progressed from the intertwined interests of officials and merchants to the present, and there are gradually signs of clarity and success. In terms of silkworm eggs, in the 25th year, 1.23 million sheets were issued in Zhejiang, 1.3 million sheets in Jiangsu, 40,000 sheets each in Sichuan, Shandong, and Anhui, 5,000 sheets in Shanxi, and 1,000 sheets in Hubei, for a total of 2.656 million sheets. Compared with the initial amount of only 50,000 sheets issued, the progress can be described as rapid. In terms of silk reeling, in the second half of the year, in view of the turning point in foreign silk sales, high silk prices, and promising business prospects, silk factories and car numbers increased sharply. By August, there were 48 silk factories operating in Shanghai, with 11,118 cars, 37 in Wuxi, with 11,802 cars, and 24 in Zhejiang, with 994 cars, for a total of 109 factories, with 28,914 cars, the most prosperous period of the year. In terms of silk prices, from June to November, high-grade white factory silk rose to an average price level of over 850 yuan, to 865 yuan. White factory silk A grade was 847.50 yuan, B grade was 825 yuan. For other silk products, after the failure of the Japanese-Indian business association, Indian merchants turned to purchase Hua silk in large numbers, so the sales of 輯里 and 雙宫 silk were very active. 七里 silk rose from 530 yuan to 700 yuan, and 雙宫 silk rose from 365 yuan to 440 yuan, all of which were high price records for the year. Shanghai raw silk exports gradually increased after May, reaching 7,297 bags in December, the highest number in a year. (To be continued)

申報 Literature Supplement

### Farewell

— Shu Qun

"Farewell!"

The person he likes leans against the cabin space he occupies, gently waving his hand, his eyes seemingly guarding his sleeves; why won't she look at him? He is adding a few more wrinkles to the corners of his eyes because he is reluctant to leave this time. Isn't he also the person she likes?

Since they like each other, why are they reluctantly separating? Aren't they still maintaining good feelings?

They came to this strange place only a month ago. They rented a room next to a quiet street, the window close to the lawn, with small trees, vegetable plots, and in the tall courtyard walls in the grass, there were two flags of Hitler and Mussolini, often fluttering there; nearby, almost all were the residences of noble people. From this, one can also know how luxurious their room is and how lucky their life is. And they prepared bags of flour and rice at the corner of the wall; so they were happy, busy exploring the new scenery of this place, sometimes, they didn't return until late at night.

Soon, she went to a singing group to learn to sing, and he stayed at home alone to read, or to visit old friends. So, in a few days all his friends knew he was back, and they also knew he had brought a newly acquainted girl. For some reason, friends came to see that girl; every time a friend came, they ate with them, sometimes, after they had eaten, he would specially buy food from outside for his friends, or he would make it himself again. After the friends left, she would often ask him:

"What does that friend do"?

His answer was always these few sentences:

"Writes manuscripts".

Or:

"Writer".

After hearing his words, she often said to herself:

"Writer, writer"!

In her pure heart, she only knew to praise the noble term of "writer".

After half a month, almost all the friends he knew had come. If there were one or two friends who happened to come when she was not at home; when he told her, she would ask:

"Is he also a writer"?

"Yes, yes"!

Once, she suddenly asked him:

"Why are they all hungry"?

He remained silent and did not answer her. She thought he hadn't heard, so she said again:

"Are they all hungry"?

"Yes, yes"!

She was a little strange, because she grew up in a rich family, and she rarely knew the lives of people outside her circle. This time, by chance, she followed her feelings, stole some money from home and escaped with him, so she asked again:

"Then why are they all hungry"?

He still didn't answer her; at the same time, she saw his expression and didn't ask him anything more.

From then on, when she saw his friends, she would first ask:

"Are you hungry"?

Gradually, she seemed to have become a habit:

"Are you hungry"?

This had already been asked of him, and at the same time, she should also ask herself the same question.

"Then why are we all hungry"?

She didn't answer him either, as if she already understood all the reasons for the hungry.

In the end, they had to separate in hunger. He sent her to the sea liner heading to her hometown.

They shook hands and left. He was on the shore, she was on the boat, a strip of sea between the shore and the boat separated them, each saying:

"Farewell!"

However, neither of them said on what year and day they would meet again.

### Childhood Innocence

— Li Huiying

Since my wife was hospitalized for childbirth, the responsibility of taking care of the children at home has been entirely on my shoulders. The child, who is only two years old, is used to being with his mother all day long, so naturally he can't help but miss her when she suddenly disappears. Originally, I was determined to sacrifice my daily work and devote all my time to taking care of the child, but sometimes I still can't take good care of him. As he plays, he calls out for his mother, and when he looks at his mother's photo, he shouts loudly, "Want Mom!" A child's affection for his mother is truly indescribable. Later, when he couldn't wait for his mother to come back, he cried out repeatedly, "Mom is gone." As a result, this difficult-to-relieve sorrow forced my heart to burn with anxiety, and I felt overwhelmed in coping with it. Because of his longing for his mother, this child simply ignores his father's coaxing, and keeps shouting, "Don't want Dad, don't want Dad!" No matter how I tell him all his favorite stories and food, trying to win his favor, it's impossible, until he finishes this bout of crying.

But during the day, it's still better. When a few friends come over, with more people around, he can forget about his longing for his mother. Winter days are short, so after hanging out for a while, the day passes. When it gets dark, the problems start. The house is cold and quiet. Not only does the child easily think of his mother, but I, as a father, also involuntarily think back to the previous scenes in the house and the mother in the hospital room because of this unusually deserted new environment. Usually, the child sleeps close to his mother on a large bed. Now that there's one person missing on the bed, it's impossible to escape the child's true memory and recollection. His "Want Mom" slogan becomes more and more energetic, and also more and more miserable, exhausting me, the person who is playing the role of both father and mother, and making me helpless.

Therefore, I'm thinking: The sorrow of orphans, I'm afraid only orphans can truly understand.

With some difficulty, after using some wisdom, I managed to coax the child to sleep. Looking at the time, it's already 9:30, a full hour and a half later than the usual time he goes to bed. Who should be responsible for this little bit of guilt? The child doesn't sleep soundly. After a while, he opens his eyes and looks around. After a moment, he shouts "Mom" a few times in his sleep, and after a while, he cries out involuntarily. I can't relieve the child of his longing for his mother, so I am very anxious myself.

When I go to bed, I feel an infinite sense of fatigue on my body. My mind is dizzy, and my whole body feels like I've done a day of heavy labor. All my joints are a little sore. After taking a deep breath, I can't help but think to myself: Being a mother, this job is very difficult, and very tiring. For me, who is doing the job of a mother for the first time, due to unfamiliarity in many aspects, it's natural to involuntarily express such feelings.

In the night, when I wake up, the child is awake. He is looking for his mother, crying non-stop. First, he stretches out his hand and gropes around, not finding the person he is waiting for, then he opens his eyes and looks around randomly, and then cries out: "Mom, Mom won't come, don't want Dad." He pushes me away, and tears flow out drop by drop. It's no use giving him toys to play with or saying nice things to him. He just keeps crying and shouting until he cries himself tired, and then he goes back to sleep with his eyes half-closed.

How anxious I am! My wife has to stay in the hospital for ten days before she can be discharged. If the child keeps crying like this every day for ten days, what will I do? I am worried. So, I think of families without a housewife and children without a mother. The shortcomings in between cannot be compensated for in a short time, and the chaos in between is also quite alarming.

Unexpectedly, after two days, the child has completely adapted to this new environment and life. He plays with me, eats and drinks with me, and sleeps with me. He occasionally talks about his mother, but he doesn't cry or shout, and it passes in a moment. This puts my mind at ease. But there's one thing. Although the child's situation of looking for his mother has eased on the surface, it's very obvious that he hasn't forgotten his mother in his heart. He often thinks silently for half a day without saying a word, and often still seems to be deliberately stating, "Don't say Mom," "Don't want Mom," but the smile from his face has disappeared. There must be his reasons in between.

When friends come, they all say in unison that the child has lost weight, and praise the child's cleverness. If he cried and shouted for Mom every day, the adults wouldn't be able to do anything about it. I can't tell if the child has lost weight, because I see him every day, without a comparison. But if he has really lost some weight, it must be related to his praised cleverness. He is lost in longing. This, inevitably gives me, the father who thought he had fulfilled his motherly responsibilities well, a big blow in my heart. The child has not forgotten his mother. The child is actually thinking about his mother even more than he did in the past few days. The reason he doesn't say it out loud is that it shows that he also knows how to suppress his unhappy feelings in his little heart.

What method can I use to cure the child of this disease? Or should I let it be and let it develop naturally? If I really put myself in the child's shoes and think about it, then I should be sad for the child. Precisely because the child doesn't say it out loud, it makes me, the father, even more sad. I have asked some friends for advice, asking them if they have any clever ways to make the child return to his former joy; I have also asked doctors who specialize in treating diseases, asking them what good medicine can be used to cure the child's inner depression, but they all cannot give me a satisfactory answer. This can't help but add another layer of sadness to the child. Since everyone has no solution, then I can only let it be.

Here, I feel how close the need of a mother is to a child. The love that a father gives to a child is how unwelcome it is to the child. On the contrary, the maternal love can get the child's most sincere support.

During this period, I also have to set aside some time every day to go to the hospital to see the child's mother, that soft and weak mother like cotton candy. Every time I sit next to the hospital bed, the wife's first words are always to ask if the child is good at home, and then she asks if he is eating a lot, and if he misses Mom so much. That kind of caring and unforgettable appearance is exactly displaying the maternal concern and love for her children. I tell her everything truthfully, but I don't say that the child has lost weight. Every time she finishes listening, she always asks back with a suspicious expression, "Is it true? Is the child so easy to handle?" Based on her usual experience with the child, she doesn't believe that the child would be so obedient and wouldn't pursue his mother's disappearance, because in the past, the child couldn't leave his mother for a moment. The wife can't help but believe my words. I have never lied to her before, and later she even felt happy for the child because of this, and she couldn't help but say, "If the child can really be like this, it will be much easier after he comes home in the future, and he won't always缠着me. This child, I didn't expect him to be so obedient, so lovely."

This continued until the ninth day. I took the child to the hospital to pick up the child's mother. Sitting in the car, I repeatedly told the child where we were going and what we were going to do. After listening, the child didn't show the joy that I had expected. Instead, he was stunned for a while, as if he was thinking about something. After a while, he slowly said: "Pick up Mom, Mom is coming." He said it indifferently, making me a little suspicious. When the mother sat in the car, she hurriedly hugged the child, and the first thing she said was: "The child has lost weight." Yes, I know he has lost weight, but at this time the child tightly hugs his mother and kisses her mouth. I stare blankly at the other small life being held in my arms.

### Description of Trivial Matters

— Wang Renshu

It seems there was a time when someone criticized the description of trivial matters in daily life. The main idea was: living in such a great era, if a writer only dwells on their own petty affairs, humming and sighing, overcome with emotion, and describing them tediously, then they must have become detached from the times, and the social value of their work will be equal to zero. … Describing trivial matters is undoubtedly a negation of political literature.

What is the phenomenon reflected in Chinese literary works due to the negation of describing trivial matters? In my opinion, it seems to have delved even deeper into the style of describing trivial matters.

This may sound a bit strange. But the reason for this pursuit is inevitable. Initially—perhaps still now—opposing the description of trivial matters was, as already mentioned, due to its content and form being individualistic. Furthermore, in order to emphasize that an author must grasp the great era, they had to start by opposing the description of trivial matters. However, the grasp of the era is by no means solely based on worldview; it requires deeper practice. It is not enough to simply immerse oneself in the great era; even more so, the great era must be dissolved in one's heart. Only by expressing this era through oneself can one truly say they have "grasped it!" Generally speaking, the description of trivial matters is a naturalistic method of description. The selection of its themes and subjects is not due to a chemical reaction between the author's subjectivity and social objectivity, but rather the subjective mixed with some trivial objective facts, or simply due to the objective that cannot be grasped, stimulating a kind of backlash in the subjective, naturally expressed. In this regard, the work can indeed express some subjective "sincerity." Especially when such works touch on the love of humanity, they can deeply move the reader's heart. Lévi-Strauss's noble motherhood and Xu Jingsong's memorial writings about Lu Xun should be descriptions of trivial matters in their nature! However, every time I read them, tears streamed down my face. And what moved people to tears were always those sentences that the author may have been writing with tears in their eyes.

A work that makes people cry may not necessarily be a good work. However, it undoubtedly possesses the necessary condition to become a literary work—the contagion of emotion. In this regard, sincerity—perhaps that is the advantage of describing trivial matters. But the disadvantages of describing trivial matters are also numerous: triviality, emotionalization, distortion of grasping reality, or fragmentation of reality. Moreover, the consistent spirit always cannot escape from sentimentality, showing personal powerlessness, and at the same time, also eliminating human ambition and fighting spirit. The impression given to the reader—is emptiness.

Unfortunately, within the group of authors who oppose the description of trivial matters, the techniques they themselves adopt still follow the naturalistic style of describing trivial matters. Of course, to avoid the trivial style of description, they mostly adopt the third-person perspective. They strive to avoid the author's appearance or speaking. But the materials they use to shape the protagonist of the work are also extremely trivial, cowardly, and even formulaic. This is due to the author's narrow personal experience, or because the author has no experience at all and relies solely on hearsay, or even because the author has read a few theoretical books, using A to represent the theoretical system of capitalists and B to represent the theoretical system of laborers—a creative method of building empty frameworks like that. Then, no matter how hard the author tries to write it out in the third person, the protagonist has already become an accumulation of trivial matters. The protagonist becomes a pile of building blocks, not a living person with a soul.

In this way, the result of opposing the description of trivial matters over the years has instead emphasized the disadvantages of the description of trivial matters—triviality. And forgotten the advantage of describing trivial matters—sincerity.

I naturally do not want to hide my own mistakes. For the past four or five years, if I have also written, I have tried my best to avoid my own pain and sentimentality when writing. Because of the unparalleled trauma that life has given me, I have also wanted to write something to express my feelings, but I always feel that what this would give people would be a poison, so I restrained myself and wrote something else that was somewhat distant from my own life. Looking back now, this has become my fatal flaw in my writing. Of course, to transmit one's own trauma to others may be sinful in a certain sense. For such a declining nation, is it still permissible to vibrate its nerves with sentimentality? However, my work has always been wrong. Here, I should certainly restrain my sentimentality. But I should even more calmly analyze this life's wound objectively, investigate the social causes, and unfold a social scene behind a fallen wounded soldier. At this time, the author and the analyzed self maintain a considerable distance, giving a description; and the analyzed self—an objective existence—deeply and urgently passes through the author's thoughts and emotions. Perhaps this analyzed self—an objective existence—is the enemy of the author's essential thoughts and emotions, but even if one strikes oneself in this way, extinguishing the enemy; however, the author has achieved the highest achievement in creation in striving to display the true picture.

According to my thinking, Lu Xun's "In the Tavern" and "The Misanthrope" were perhaps written under such circumstances. Especially "The Misanthrope," every time I read it, every sentence, even every word, gives me great pressure. Wei Lianshu's desolation seems to be my own desolation as well. Anatole France said that every work should be the author's confession; I believe this should be explained in such a context.

Naturally, the realistic creative method should be as Eugène Delacroix said in his letter to Marguerite Hackenal: "Apart from Delal's correctness, it is the transmission of typical characters in typical situations." And to achieve this, the author needs to deeply understand life even more. What the writer needs is not a bit of a worldview fabricated out of thin air, but a "worldliness" with a correct understanding. Some people call Lu Xun an "old worldly man." Before deeply studying Marx and Engels' theories, Lu Xun had such brilliant creations. On the one hand, it was because he had progressive historical views, and on the other hand, it was because he understood "worldliness." Understanding "worldliness" is not a bad thing, understanding "worldliness" and correcting it with progressive historical views. This made Lu Xun a realist writer rarely seen in the world.

But in the Chinese creative circles, which generally flow into the empty, hypocritical, trivial, vulgar, and formulaic now, I hope to return to "sincerity." That sincere attitude of describing trivial matters is still worth learning, I believe.

### Shou Moqing Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Talked About Promoting the Sale of National Products in Guangdong Province

Shou Moqing, Manager of the Guangzhou China National Products Company, was sent to Shanghai to contact business circles to prepare for the opening of a national products exhibition. He arrived at the port on the Japanese Empress yesterday afternoon. After meeting with Wang Xingyao, Director of the China National Products Production and Sales Association, he decided to visit various manufacturers within days to discuss the matter. According to Shou, Guangzhou is a major commercial port in the country with a population of about 1.3 million and a large consumption power. However, due to the backward local industry, the obstruction of transportation with neighboring provinces, and the lack of unified currency, foreign goods are rampant and a great deal of wealth is lost. Last year, the provincial government was reorganized, the currency system stabilized, and the sales of national products to Guangzhou gradually increased. However, due to the high exchange rate, the sales market is still not smooth. Recently, the Guangzhou branch of the National Economic Construction Association has joined forces with various local agencies and organizations to establish the Guangdong National Products Movement Promotion Association to promote and develop the national products industry. However, due to the small number of local manufacturers, he came to Shanghai to contact various factories, invite them to join the association, and prepare for the opening of an exhibition to facilitate sales. Shou continued that Guangdong's industry currently only has two items, rubber products and knitwear, which are of good quality and can meet local needs. The province-run sugar and cement are also successful, with sugar already being exported and cement only being used locally. Other industries are difficult to develop due to a lack of raw materials or equipment. Domestic manufacturers can go to Guangzhou to promote sales and will make a great profit and recover many rights and interests.

### Overseas Chinese from Three Countries Arrived in Shanghai by Ship the Day Before Yesterday

### Shi Xianru, Reporter of the American National Daily, Returned to China for Investigation

Yesterday, He Announced the Current Situation of Overseas Chinese in the United States; The Issue of American-Born Chinese Students is Serious

Shi Xianru, Propaganda Director of the Kuomintang's US General Branch and reporter of the American National Daily, returned to China from the United States yesterday morning and arrived in Shanghai. Mr. Shi has been in the United States for seven years and has paid close attention to the situation of Chinese expatriates in the United States. He has also served in our consulate general in San Francisco. After returning to China, he will go to various places to investigate. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency went to interview him and was informed of the recent situation of Chinese expatriates in the United States, which is recorded in detail as follows.

Recent Situation of Party Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs in the Americas

According to Mr. Shi, ① Regarding our country's party affairs in the Americas, due to the frequent national disasters in recent years, attention has been paid to saving the country and propaganda work. Therefore, most party members have a tendency to abandon the doctrine and talk about policies. Three or four years ago, Kuomintang party members often had factional disputes with each other. The situation has been better in the past year, but there seems to be a lack of talent. ② Regarding overseas Chinese affairs, the situation of overseas Chinese in the Americas is extremely complex, with deep-rooted concepts of faction, region, and clan. Therefore, there is often a tendency to fight. In the past three or four years, due to the seriousness of national affairs, most people have gradually shifted from a narrow spirit of infighting to the struggle for the country and the nation. As for Chinese expatriates in the United States, most of them run restaurants, followed by laundry and antiques. There are also many who do hard labor. However, due to the American economic panic, the number of unemployed Chinese expatriates is increasing and business is also declining sharply. The current US government's "Unemployment Relief Administration" employs many unemployed expatriates, so most people do not have to worry about freezing or starving. Chinese expatriates have a strong tendency to make money, which is deeply ingrained and difficult to change. As for San Francisco, there are about 10,000 Chinese expatriates, most of whom are engaged in business and can live a decent life.

Employment Issues for Overseas Chinese Youth

Mr. Shi also said that the future employment issues of American-born Chinese youth in the United States are worthy of attention by the motherland government. Most overseas Chinese children have specialized skills, but the shops run by our overseas Chinese are old-fashioned and most of them cannot employ these specialized talents. Although American-run businesses value these native-born specialized talents, they are unwilling to employ them due to union relations, which leads to unemployment problems. There are many native-born Chinese who have studied advanced skills such as chemistry, civil engineering, and electrical engineering, but they cannot find work in the United States. The difficulties are: ① Although they are equal to Americans in law, there is still discrimination in fact. ② American industrialists are willing to employ Chinese workers because they are paid lower wages, talented, specialized, and diligent, but the unions strongly oppose it. ③ Although no Chinese youth does not shout that they want to return to the motherland, they are extremely alienated from their motherland, cannot speak Chinese, and cannot adapt to their daily life and habits. Therefore, the problem is both serious and complex.

Glimpses of American Educational Characteristics

Mr. Shi has carefully investigated the American education system in the United States and has collected more than 1,000 photos of vocational education, which he has made into slides and will contribute to the motherland. He briefly stated his impressions of the American education system, saying that there are many differences between the United States and our country that are worthy of attention: ① The United States focuses on children, not seeking to make children satisfy the school, but seeking to make the school suitable for children, focusing on their individual development. ② Recently, more attention has been paid to vocational guidance. Every school must have counselors to help students choose courses and find jobs in the future. ③ Schools are socialized. The skills and academics of graduates are not separated from the actual society at all. ④ The spirit of democracy is fully embodied. No matter what kind of academics, they are studied in school at the same time and cooperation is promoted at all times to cultivate students' group life. Shi is scheduled to go to Beijing this morning and then go to North China for investigation.

### Xiong Tonghe, a Specialist in Group Art at Central University, Went to the United States Yesterday

### Leather Shoe King Bata Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday

It is said that 5 million pairs of leather shoes are sold annually in China.

The purpose of this trip is to expand the Eastern market.

Chinese-made shoe materials will be used as much as possible.

World shoe king Bata, on this world tour to inspect branches around the world and investigate market conditions, initially departed from the Czech Republic on his private plane, passed through India and Annam, and arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago. He then took the Changxing Company's Empress of Japan liner, arriving in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday. He was accompanied by ten secretaries and attendants, and stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. The Czech Republic's Minister to China, Mr. Fejer, hosted a banquet at his official residence on Jiaozhou Road at 8:30 last night to welcome Mr. Bata. According to Mr. Bata, who told a New Sound News Agency reporter that the purpose of his trip was to inspect the business of branches around the world and investigate the leather shoe market situation. China is a very promising market. In addition to Shanghai, Bata branches have also been established in major commercial ports such as Nanjing and Hankou. According to statistics, the leather shoes supplied and sold by the head office average about five million pairs per year. Business is more developed in European countries, and more than that, because Europeans need to wear an average of four pairs of leather shoes per year. Sales in the United States are also more developed. Now I am planning to promote the markets in Eastern countries, and because China is not short of shoe-making raw materials, I plan to purchase and use them in China as much as possible. People often only know how to export and do not advocate importing. I don't think so, because it is like the human body, only knows how to excrete but does not know how to eat, life will not be guaranteed, and the same is true for trade. There must be imports and exports to achieve balance. I will not stay in Shanghai for long. I am scheduled to take the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover liner to the United States via Japan on the 27th. My plane will also be shipped from Hong Kong on the Hoover liner.

### China-Japan Trade Association Held Board Meeting Yesterday

Scheduled to convene a general meeting of members

And welcome Japanese economic envoys

The China-Japan Trade Association held a board meeting yesterday and decided to convene the first general meeting of members and prepare to welcome Japanese economic envoys. Details are as follows:

Scheduled General Meeting of Members: The China-Japan Trade Association held a board meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday on the third floor of the Jin Cheng Bank, the association's headquarters. The attendees included Chairman Zhou Zuomin, Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Rong Zongjing, Song Hanzhang, Liu Hongsheng, Li Fusun, Xu Xinliu, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Tang Shoumin, Wu Yunzhai, Lin Kanghou, Japanese directors Yoshida Seiji, Yamamoto Takeo, Bu Bu Takuji, and Funatsu Tatsuichiro. Chairman Zhou presided over the meeting. It was resolved that in accordance with Article 11 of the Articles of Association, a general meeting of members should be held once a year after consultation between the Chinese and Japanese boards of directors. The first general meeting of members is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM on March 18 at the Shanghai Pudong Fellow Association Building. The meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM.

Preparing to Welcome Japanese Envoys: The Japanese government has appointed Kodama Kenji, chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association, as an economic envoy to visit China, and many members of the association will come to China to investigate in a private capacity. They will arrive in Shanghai in mid-April and will first visit Beijing to meet with our country's authorities. After staying for about two days, they will return to Shanghai and stay for four days, visiting leaders from industry, commerce, and finance. At that time, the China-Japan Trade Association will hold a general meeting of members to celebrate. It is reported that the association will also launch an invitation to various groups to prepare for the welcome.

### Representatives of the Silk and Satin Industry Association Petitioned Yesterday

Hoping to forward to the Central Government

To Maintain the Uniform Regulations

The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association and the Motor Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association believe that our country's formal attire for men and women has long been stipulated by the Ministry of Interior's Uniform Regulations, with blue robes and black jackets, and the materials for formal attire are limited to domestic products, which was also officially promulgated in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China. Recently, some people have petitioned the Ministry of Interior, saying that long gowns and mandarin jackets are remnants of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and are outdated and should be abolished as soon as possible. Continuing to follow and use them will affect national psychology and hinder national revival. The chairman of the association, Luo Qinghua, and others, believe that the uniform systems of various countries have their own special circumstances and their own domestic products. Therefore, the Japanese Restoration did not abolish the kimono. Our country's silk has a long history and culture and is a sideline industry for rural areas. Taking it as formal attire is graceful and dignified, and using it as everyday wear is luxurious and comfortable. It seems that we should not ignore the fundamentals and follow the trivial, abandon ourselves and follow others, abolish robes and jackets, and cause trimming the feet to fit the shoes, affecting people's livelihoods. If it is a remnant of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, then it should not be rejected, because the Premier personally created the Republic, which originally united the five ethnic groups into one family. Insisting on avoiding and abandoning it would be tantamount to excluding the Manchus from the country, recognizing Manchuria as not our territory, and cutting off the Manchus' psychology of defecting. If it is inconvenient to work, then formal attire is used, and convenience is not taken. Everyday wear also follows personal habits, and it is not forbidden to wear short clothes, so they can coexist without conflict. Based on the above, Luo Qinghua, together with Cai Shengbai, Bai Xingcha, Lou Fengshao, Shen Ji'en, Pan Yisheng, Pan Runsheng, Gao Shiheng, and other representatives, went to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau of this city at 10:00 AM yesterday to petition, hoping to forward it to the Central Government, and unanimously advocated that the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Department, Tao Baichuan, and the Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Huanru, received them. They deeply appreciated the petition's opinions and agreed that according to our country's habits and economy, there was no need to modify the uniform system, and promised to forward it to the Central Government. The representatives will take the night train to Beijing today to petition the Ministry of Interior and other agencies.

### The Executive Committee of the Money Industry Association Proposes Members to Revise Industry Regulations

Shao Yanshan and four others

The Shanghai Money Industry Association held its 34th executive committee meeting at its clubhouse on Ningbo Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. The attendees included committee members Shao Yanshan, Liu Wuqiao, Zhang Wenbo, Wang Jiemei, Zhang Mengzhou, etc., chaired by Shao Yanshan and recorded by Ge Huaiqing. Regarding the annual meeting resolution of the Inner Garden, the case of organizing a committee to revise industry regulations, it was resolved that the executive committee would propose five people: Shao Yanshan, Liu Wuqiao, Zhang Mengzhou, Yan Dayou, and Lu Shuchen. The remaining six people will be proposed at the general meeting of members on March 2. The meeting adjourned at about 3:00 PM.

### The Chamber of Commerce Requests Another Extension for Reporting Capital

Extend for one month

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office, stating: "Regarding the case of industrial and commercial enterprises in this city reporting their brand name, address, responsible person's name, operating capital, or share capital in accordance with Article 46 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, this association has discussed with your office and extended the deadline to February 28. However, there are only four days left until the deadline, and most applicants have not received the application forms to be filled out, and other procedures are also too late. There are many shops in this city, and it is the first time that this matter has been handled, so it is difficult to apply ordinary standards. It is requested that your office consider the situation and grant another extension of one month. This would be greatly appreciated."

### The Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter Requesting Modification

Various items in the Collection Notice for the First Category of Income Tax

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, based on the research results of the Income Tax Special Committee, sent a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office requesting modifications to the draft Collection Notice for the First Category and the method of asset valuation, stating: "Regarding the draft Collection Notice for the First Category of Business Income Tax, at the research meeting held on January 20, representatives raised opinions and requested that the articles be added, deleted, and modified, such as Articles 5, 12, and 15 of the draft for the first category, and Article 15 of the method of asset valuation. It has been jointly resolved that this association will send a public letter No. 305 on February 3, requesting that your office adopt and modify it. After the meeting, the personnel designated by this association continued to discuss the areas where the draft should be considered, and on February 20, sent a public letter No. 320, continuing to inform your office that there are additions to the proviso in Article 9 of the draft for the first category and the addition of Article 2. Now, the results of the continued discussion are divided into the first category draft and the asset valuation section. All the areas that should be added, deleted, and modified are recorded on another paper and sent to you for review. In addition to the useful life of the depreciation rate calculation table, which should adopt flexible regulations, and whether the calculation basis of the depreciation rate is appropriate, we are seeking opinions from relevant parties, and the collection notice for the second category income and the third category income will be discussed further and reported in another letter. All the items that were requested to be modified in the two public letters No. 305 and No. 320 are now included together, so that your office can easily handle them together. As for the points that are requested to be corrected this time, there are reasons that need to be briefly explained. For example, Article 171, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law states that if the public reserve exceeds one-half of the total capital, it is only allowed to distribute dividends first, and it is not a restriction on further drawing of public reserves. The draft uses the provisions allowed by the Company Law and compares them to the provisions of restriction in Article 11, which seems to be a legal mistake. Item 13 states that the income tax that has been paid should be deducted from the income tax payable. If the deduction is not enough, it should be allowed to be refunded, which is a matter of course. The collection notice is a procedural law, and it is inconvenient to cite it without this provision, so it should be added. In addition, the useful life of the depreciation rate calculation table specified in the asset valuation method is too fixed. In addition to sending letters to the Architects Association, the Engineers Association, etc., to solicit opinions, a flexible provision should be added to the calculation table so that there is room for flexibility when needed in practice. Item 18 of the valuation method states that inventory consumption shall not exceed 5% of the book inventory amount. The variety of commodities is wide, and the degree of consumption varies depending on the nature of the goods. It is difficult to predetermine a uniform standard. This item should be completely deleted. Although Item 19 has the five words "or other reasons" as a general provision, the conciliation procedure precedes bankruptcy, and there are many discounted settlements. Therefore, it is proposed to add the two words "conciliation" under the escape clause or above bankruptcy to make it complete. The word "legitimate" in the phrase "after legitimate collection" in the same item seems strict and is actually redundant. Under what circumstances is it legitimate collection, and what is an illegitimate collection? This clause is superfluous and causes disputes and should be deleted. Most of the accounts receivable amortized in installments as mentioned in Item 21 are unable to be paid in full, and there are actions for installment payments. It is not yet known whether the principal can be paid on time, let alone the interest rate. If the present value is calculated according to the interest rate as the valuation standard, it is only to inflate the books, which is not in line with the actual capital, and it is not the purpose of striving for accurate valuation. This item should also be completely deleted. As for the other items that are proposed to be modified and added, it is considered unnecessary to explain them, and they are not detailed in the letter. Accordingly, the articles are attached separately. Please check and handle it. This is addressed to the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance.

Items to be Modified in the Collection Notice

(8) It is proposed to revise this item to: "The term 'public reserve' includes all public reserves, retained earnings, and reserves with the nature of public reserves." (9) It is proposed to add a proviso and a second item to this item as follows: "...However, if it is necessary in fact or in custom, only the actual amount received may be calculated." "If anyone wants to use the original provisions of the previous item to calculate the total amount of income in a certain year after calculating the total amount of income in accordance with the proviso of the previous item, they shall report to the主管征收機關 within three months after the beginning of that year." (10) It is proposed to add a proviso to this item as follows: "...However, if the total amount of income is calculated in accordance with the proviso of the previous item, only the expenses that have been paid may be included in the actual expenses." (11) It is proposed to revise this item to: "The premium for the issuance of shares by a company exceeding the par value and the public reserve that has reached one-half of the total capital shall be included in the capital calculation." (12) The items that are proposed to be revised in this item are two: In this item, please delete the nine words "經恊理及其他使用人" after "shareholders, directors, supervisors." Three: Please delete the five words "or reform equipment" in this item. Four: Please delete the three words "or effectiveness" in this item. (13) It is proposed to revise this item to: "The income tax that has been paid in the business income shall be deducted from the amount of income tax payable. If the deduction is insufficient, or if it cannot be deducted because there is no need to pay tax, a request for a refund shall be made to the主管署." (15) It is proposed to delete this item in its entirety. (16) It is proposed to revise this item to: "If the remaining amount of property of Type A and Type B profit-making enterprises exceeds the original capital reserve reserve and retained earnings due to merger, dissolution, business cessation, transfer, liquidation or management, tax shall be levied on the excess part according to the tax rate in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations."

### Repairing the Shanghai-Nagasaki Submarine Cable is Extremely Difficult

Work Suspended Temporarily

According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, the submarine cable between Shanghai and Nagasaki suddenly became disconnected due to a malfunction that occurred before dawn on the 14th. The Japanese Ministry of Communications sent a repair ship to repair it urgently. However, due to the dense fog covering the sea recently, various inconveniences have occurred in the operation, so that there is still no clue. It was also found that the location of the cable break, according to the measurement results, although it was determined to be outside Wusongkou, about forty or fifty miles from Baoshan, the Ogasawara repair ship, which was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to search there, has been shrouded in dense fog for the past two or three days, unable to distinguish anything nearby, making it difficult to start. Moreover, the place where it was picked up is very different from the initial electrical measurement due to the relationship of fresh water. However, it is determined that it must be between fifty and sixty nautical miles from Baoshan County. However, that place is also buried under three feet of mud washed out by the Yangtze River, making the work extremely difficult. It is again attacked by dense fog, making navigation unfree. On the other hand, because ships enter and exit frequently, navigation is very dangerous. Therefore, work is temporarily suspended at present, and repairs will continue after the weather clears. If the damaged place is still not easy to find, the only way is to sacrifice a part of the cable and replace it with a new cable.

### Goods Entering and Leaving the Maigen Road Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway are Crowded

Cotton from Shaanxi Intermodal Transport is the Most

The Maigen Road freight station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is recently experiencing unusually crowded incoming and outgoing goods, especially cotton from Shaanxi intermodal transport. As a result, the original equipment of the station is not sufficient for use. It has jointly requested the Shanghai bankers to take care of the goods, and eight measures have been drafted, stipulating that when the cotton cannot be stored in the Maigen Road warehouse, all cotton transported to the bank warehouses will be stored, and the unloading fees, warehouse rent, fire insurance, and other fees will be paid by the cargo owners according to the prescribed rates. However, the shunting fee shall be borne by the railway for one-third, with the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways each bearing half. After the bank dispatches the goods to the warehouse, it will issue a warehouse receipt and send it to the stationmaster of the Maigen Road freight station for safekeeping. When the cargo owner picks up the goods, they should still contact the freight station, and the stationmaster will transfer the warehouse receipt to pick up the goods from the bank warehouse. The above measures have been submitted to the Ministry for approval.

Zong has now found out that the car with license plate number 11896 belongs to Zhou Jue (also known as Zhicheng), the current director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, and the driver is Xia Ahua from Ningbo. He has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Xia of violating Article 284 of the Penal Code for negligent injury and also listing Zhou Jue as a defendant in accordance with Articles 191 and 195 of the Civil Code, demanding that they be jointly and severally liable for medical expenses and other fees of 1,312 yuan.

### Lawyer Falsely Accused Sentenced to Three Months

Suspended for Three Years

Lawyer Xuan Zhendong represented Sheng Sheng Company in suing Zhang Jinrong, a native of Huaicheng living at 29 Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, for owing more than 300 yuan. The High Court's second instance judgment ruled that, according to law, there could be no third instance appeal for cases under 500 yuan, so the execution was immediately confirmed. Zhang Jinrong then falsely accused Lawyer Yi to the prosecutor of the local court, claiming that the lawyer had taken 30 yuan to resolve the entire case and advised him not to appeal, thus accusing him of fraud and breach of trust. After investigation by Prosecutor Tang, it was determined that since there was no third instance appeal, the lawyer, being knowledgeable in the law, had no reason to deceive, and that 30 yuan could not resolve 300 yuan. Therefore, Zhang Jinrong was prosecuted for false accusation. Judge Miao held a hearing, and Zhang Jinrong cried, claiming that he had been fooled by others and begged for leniency for the sake of his family. Yesterday's judgment stated that Zhang Jinrong, intentionally causing others to be subject to criminal punishment, falsely accused the relevant public official and was sentenced to three months of imprisonment, suspended for three years.

According to his confession, there were other accomplices in the Huofeng Company on Feihong Road, so they went there and arrested the accomplice Xu Haitang, 31 years old, from Ningbo.

### Repaying Evil with Kindness, Embezzlement and Theft Committed Together

Lu Guan Embezzled More Than 3,000 Yuan More Than 100 Pairs of Stolen Shoes Were Recovered

Xie Shifang, alias Afang, a native of Ningbo, raised funds in 1931 to open the Xinhua Shoe Store in the Penglai Market in Nanshi. The business was doing well. Wang Hanyin, a native of Jingjiang, was also an employee in the Nanchang Machine Factory in the market. Not long after, he was dismissed by the factory. Xie knew Wang and felt sorry for him for being unemployed, so he allowed him to help in the store. Initially, Wang was diligent and self-motivated, but later Xie participated in domestic product exhibitions in Peiping, Qingdao, and other places, so he appointed Wang as a salesperson. Unexpectedly, Wang's evil nature was difficult to change, and he gradually embezzled and used the proceeds from the sales and forged letters, falsely claiming that the goods were missing on the way. Xie was illiterate, so he was deceived by Wang. Later, in 1934, Xie opened the Xiaohuayuan Shoe Shop in the market and appointed Wang as the manager. Wang took advantage of this opportunity to embezzle as before. In February last year, Xie opened the Huahua Shoe Shop on Zhejiang Road and personally managed it. The two stores in the Penglai Market were managed by Wang, Zhu Senyuan from Huzhou, Wang Qinghe from Yangzhou, apprentice Shi Longsheng, Wang Deqing, and Chen Yindi. Because Xie was not present, Wang colluded with Zhu and others to commit fraud. Over the year, the embezzled funds totaled more than 2,000 yuan. Their method was to not record the proceeds from the sales and divide the money together in the evening, often amounting to dozens of yuan per day. Unexpectedly, their scheme was discovered by Xie, who sent his brother-in-law, Wang Renfu, to Shanghai to manage the business. Fearing that Wang Renfu's arrival in Shanghai would expose everything, Wang instigated the apprentice Shi Longsheng to steal leather shoes at night and pawn them. The pawn was discovered by Xie, who immediately reported it to the Detective Team of the Municipal Police Bureau. The team arrested Wang and others, and after investigation, found that the confession was true and recovered more than 100 pairs of stolen shoes. They transferred Wang and others to the local court, where the prosecutor filed a public prosecution. The case was heard by Judge Chen Kangsun in the Sixth Criminal Court yesterday, and witness Wu Jiqing testified to everything. Judge Chen, seeing that the facts were clear, began the debate and scheduled the judgment for the morning of the 7th of next month.

### Conclusion of Abandoned Wife Jing Haochuan Case

Jing Yang, wife of Jing Haochuan, the young owner of the Jingchangxiang Iron Factory on Zhiyuan Road, Zhabei, has been married for eight years and has three children. However, Jing was not very satisfied with his yellow-faced wife, so he had an affair, which was caught by his wife. He was punished by the court for this, and the relationship between the couple became increasingly worse. Jing Yang was abandoned by him, and the mother and four children lived in a cooking shed at No. 1 Zhaoqing Lane, Zhaofeng Road, leading a miserable life. Jing Yang hired Lawyer Ma to sue her husband for divorce in the local court and to pay alimony of 3,000 yuan and all of her dowry. Judge Zhu questioned them. The defendant said that the dowry had been destroyed during the Shanghai war, but the plaintiff said that it was at the concubine's place. The judge took both parties to various places to investigate the facts. The court debate was concluded yesterday, and the judgment will be announced at the end of the month.

### Conclusion of the Hongfa Lawsuit

Mediated by Wang Xiaolai, both parties agree to withdraw the case.

Gu Fan, a 28-year-old resident of No. 1 Jingyuan Lane, West Xima Road, West Gate, currently an employee of Zhongfu Bank, along with his father, Gu Linzheng (who was in Japan at the time), pooled together 2,000 yuan to establish the Hongfa Company on Yong'an Street in the French Concession. They hired Zhang Shuming (currently 54 years old, residing at No. 4, Lane 65, Laobeidou, now in Shantou) from Shantou as manager, Zhang Fenke (50 years old, from Shantou) as assistant manager, and Zhang Jinhao (51 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 3, Lane 15, Wutong Road, Xiaodongdou) as an employee. The business commenced in the summer of the eighth year of the Republic (1919). By the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the accumulated public funds reached 370,000 yuan. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the company suddenly went bankrupt. Zhang and the others did not go through liquidation procedures. Gu Linzheng passed away at this time. On April 2, 24th year of the Republic (1935), Gu Fan, through his lawyer, filed a complaint with the criminal division of the Special Second Court, accusing Zhang Shuming, Zhang Fenke, and Zhang Jinhao of breach of trust, business encroachment, and embezzlement. After multiple hearings by the former magistrate Zhang Chaozuo, the three defendants, along with their defense lawyer Dong Chi, appeared in court. The first defendant was in Shantou and failed to appear despite repeated summons. Because Zhang Shuming had nine brothers who operated nine qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) in Shantou, the court decided to transfer the case to the civil division and suspend the criminal trial. Witness Du Yingchu was appointed to go to Shantou's Hongkang Qianzhuang with the defendant Zhang Fenke to investigate. Upon their return to Shanghai, they reported that Zhang Shuming had fled without a trace and that all nine qianzhuang had also gone bankrupt, owing more than 600,000 yuan. Subsequently, Wang Xiaolai, the former chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stepped in to mediate. Both parties agreed to withdraw the lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Qiu Huanrang, a magistrate of the Special Court, presided over a continued hearing in the Second Criminal Court. According to the plaintiff's attorney, the first defendant, along with the witness, went to Shantou to audit the accounts, and the accounts matched. He requested that the court find the defendants not guilty. The court then questioned the two defendants once more, ordered the closing arguments, and announced that the verdict would be delivered on March 3rd.

### Manager Wang Liwei of Jiuyi Factory Found Not Guilty

Wang Liwei, a Wuxi native, shareholder and manager of Jiuyi Hosiery Factory located at the intersection of Route Sapey and Route Conty in the closed French Concession, was previously accused of business encroachment by Zhang Ziliang and other shareholders, also from Wuxi, for an amount of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. They presented an accountant's audit report as evidence. The French police brought Wang to the Special Second Court for prosecution according to the law. The plaintiffs, Zhang Ziliang and other shareholders, also hired lawyers Li Mo and Xi Yuchang to file a civil suit, requesting to recover the embezzled funds. Wang Liwei hired Xu Shihao as his defense lawyer and submitted all the account books. The circumstances of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. The case has been heard in court multiple times by Liao Chanshu, the head of the criminal division of the Special Second Court. After summoning both parties for investigation, the court found that the defendant had not engaged in embezzlement and acquitted Wang Liwei in the Second Criminal Court yesterday. The civil suit filed by the plaintiffs was dismissed.

### General Office of the China International Famine Relief Commission Scheduled to Move to Shanghai

The China International Famine Relief Commission was established in the tenth year of the Republic (1921) after the great drought in North China. Its purpose was to provide relief for natural disasters and construct famine prevention measures. At that time, the capital had not yet moved south, and most of the work was in the north, so the general office was located in Beiping. It had four departments: engineering, agriculture, auditing, and general affairs, working in coordination. Branch offices were established in the provinces of Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Suiyuan. Offices were established in Anqing and Nanchang to serve Anhui and Jiangxi respectively, and the Yangtze River Relief Advisory Committee was established in Shanghai to coordinate relief efforts in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, so as to achieve the effect of direct command. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and the political center shifted from north to south, in order to meet the needs of the times and facilitate contact with the government, liaison offices were established in Shanghai and Nanjing. A fundraising department was added to the Shanghai office. Recently, as the work increasingly focused on the south and negotiations with the government became more frequent, the general office, being far away in the north, found communication by letters and telegrams very inconvenient. Therefore, at the last national representative assembly, it was decided to move the office to Shanghai to facilitate the commission's work. On the 19th of this month, the Executive Committee of the commission held its 158th meeting in Beiping, deciding to begin the relocation in March of this year and complete it by May. The newly appointed general secretary, Mr. Ju Ke, is in charge of the preparations, striving to fulfill the resolution and facilitate progress. It is heard that they plan to lease additional space at the current location of the Shanghai office at No. 505 Henan Road and expand and reorganize it.

### Unification and Peace (Continued)

— Pan Gongzhan

(7) Then, what kind of power should the people use to avoid war and help the central government achieve peaceful unification? I think it is nothing more than the following points:

(1) Exert the authority of public opinion. As shown by past facts, such as the resolution of the Two Guang Incident and the turning point of the Xi'an Incident, we can see the power of genuine public opinion in the country. Genuine public opinion never arises from those suffering from the infantile disease of self-proclaimed leftists. They only know how to oppose the government and the central government. They either say that the central government is compromising with the enemy, or that the central government's resistance to the enemy is false. Even the Student Federation in Beiping, under the command of the student union in Madrid, the capital of Spain, actually held a celebration at the beginning of the Xi'an Incident, with such a loss of conscience and madness. How can they recognize the times, and what public opinion can they have? Genuine public opinion also never arises from those suffering from the narrow-minded disease of self-proclaimed rightists. They certainly know that the Chinese people should support the government and the leader at present, but they do not understand how to build a deep foundation of faith for the government and the leader in the broad masses of the people. If they gradually leave the people, what public opinion can they have? Genuine public opinion arises entirely from the common sense and justice of the vast majority of the non-partisan and non-factional people in the country. During the Two Guang Incident, despite the good name that Chen Jitang and his ilk borrowed, the whole country sneered at it, and Chen had to flee. During the Xi'an Incident, despite the good name that Zhang Xueliang and his ilk flaunted, the whole country hated him to the bone, and Zhang had to confess his guilt. As the saying goes, "What ten eyes see and ten hands point to is severe!" If we, the people, never abandon ourselves and uphold the common sense and justice we hold for the country and the nation, remain unyielding to power, and incorruptible by wealth, and exert our most impartial and just public opinion, then the edge of our arguments will be able to give the most severe blow to any conspiracy by ambitious warlords and malicious politicians to undermine unity. How severe would this be, not just ten eyes and ten hands? Since public opinion has such an effect, it can be regarded as an important driving force for the country to embark on the road of democratization and modernity. Not only should the people make good use of it, but the government should also cherish it even more. The way to cherish it is, for example, to notify the leaders of all social strata of the situation of political evolution and the direction of national policies, directly or indirectly, so that they can have a fair understanding and their discussions will not be wrong. This is one. Within the scope of not violating the highest principles of national construction and not disparaging the central government's recent national policies, the road to freedom of speech should be relaxed as much as possible, so that public opinion can be expressed, the lower levels can reach the upper levels, and benevolent criticism can be exerted to eliminate malicious slander. This is the second. At the same time, in this extraordinary period, those traitorous publications that endanger the foundation of the country, resist the government, anesthetize the youth, and mislead them into the wrong path, regardless of what kind of imperialism instigated them, should be resolutely banned, so that they will no longer harm the group. It must be known that prohibiting harmful speech is to protect pure public opinion. This is the third. If the government and the people can both attach importance to fair and straightforward public opinion, not only will no military or politician dare to risk great disobedience to undermine unity, but the democratic foundation of the country will also be built very firmly.

(2) Complete the institutions of the rule of law. China must wait until unification is completed before it can join the ranks of modern countries. Of course, the minimum condition for modern countries must be a country under the rule of law. Whether it is countries like England, the United States, and France, even Soviet Russia, which was built on the dictatorship of the proletariat, is now talking about the rule of law. Not only do they have their constitutions, but also new constitutions. As for sanctioning those so-called reactionary elements by their cadres, they all resort to the courts. For example, the so-called fascist countries like Italy and Germany, and countries leaning towards fascism like Japan, all have their constitutions and defend their political systems as the most suitable for the spirit of democracy. The Japanese military has almost been running amok, but after the February 26 Incident, it had to be followed by the legal "pacification of the military." Therefore, to achieve the peaceful unification of the country, we must do our best to enhance the prestige of the law. "The prince commits a crime, and the common people are equally guilty." There must be this spirit of equality before the law for everyone, and then the country can have peaceful unification. If we blindly accommodate the facts and ignore the law, then the principles will be swept away, order will be difficult to maintain, and temporary unification will still be a paper tiger. If we want to realize the rule of law, then the completion of the institutions of the rule of law must not be delayed. The following items should be implemented within a limited time: (1) Convene the National Assembly and promulgate the Constitution, so that the whole country can jointly swear to abide by this fundamental law. (2) The provinces and cities should separately intensify the promotion of local autonomy, so that the lower-level foundation of democracy can be consolidated. (3) The systematic organization of courts at all levels should be reorganized and completed in a short period of time. (4) The prosecutorial system of courts at all levels should strive to be perfect, so that the prosecutors can fully exercise their functions and represent the state in prosecuting all criminal events. (5) The governments at all levels should follow the regulations of examination and selection in employing people, so that everyone can make the most of their talents. (6) The powers and duties of the government agencies should be defined, allowing them to cooperate and prevent them from overstepping their powers. In non-military areas, the interference of active-duty soldiers in local administration should be strictly prohibited.

(3) Accelerate economic construction. With China's vast territory and large population, to consolidate unification, we must first have a well-developed network of railways, highways, waterways, telecommunications, and etc. Therefore, the construction of various transportation enterprises such as railways, highways, shipping, aviation, postal and telecommunications, and broadcasting should be helped by the strength of the whole people in the shortest possible time, so that the government can catch up. Developed transportation will inevitably produce genuine unification. Secondly, monetary policy must be stably implemented, rural areas must be revitalized, and industry must be developed. Then the economic life of the people can be expected to break away from the feudal era and reach the stage of the national economy in the era of industrial and commercial capital, forming a whole economic unit. If the economic life of the general public is promoted by the fundamental economic construction of the nation, then prosperity and decline will be shared, and interests will be the same. The people of each province and city will inevitably establish a foundation of fraternal unity in material life, and their strength in supporting unification will not be shaken by any force.

In short, "unification" is the most important need of China at present; peaceful "unification" is especially the common hope of China at present. Whether "unification" can really be achieved and whether "peaceful unification" can be maintained, we, the people, must not neglect our own strength. The Analects say, "If I desire benevolence, benevolence will come." We may as well say, "If the people desire unification, then there will be unification"; "If the people desire peaceful unification, then there will be peaceful unification." (The End)

Talk and Words

### Remnants of Savagery

— Luo Jia

I can't recall which book it was in, but it was probably about love. It's said that after a broken heart or a significant shock, both men and women can exhibit a strange behavior, a kind of psychological disorder, called "persecution mania." This condition manifests as inflicting cruelty on the person they love for pleasure, such as severe beatings that leave the other person covered in wounds, or biting the other person's neck or some part of their body until they bleed. I have no expertise in love, having never experienced heartbreak or a significant shock, so I have no idea how or why this psychological disorder of "persecution mania" occurs, or what it's like. Moreover, I've only seen this kind of "persecution mania" in books; I haven't even seen it in American love movies. Perhaps this condition is a step beyond "suicide" or "jumping off buildings," not something ordinary people do when they cry out, "Oh God, where is my lover?"

However, I know that although humans have put on formal attire and styled their hair into airplane wings, the barbarity of primitive times still lurks within their bodies. In moments of mental instability, they will immediately reveal their bestial nature, using the most cruel means on the person they hate or love most to satisfy a momentary desire. If this happens in the arena of love, perhaps it is "persecution mania." Other mentally ill people often like to fight, kill, and set fires; a person who has been ill for a long time, upon finally recovering, will likely curse the doctor and fantasize about killing all the doctors in the world...

What's strange, though, is that even when people are mentally stable, that cruel bestiality is still exposed. Take, for example, watching beheadings or executions. What relationship does the criminal have with the spectators? Yet they applaud and cheer without reservation, as if they have an irreconcilable hatred for the person being killed. The reason is that the cruel scene of "the white blade flashing and fresh blood flowing," "the gunshot ringing and the body falling to the ground," satisfies their desires.

A Havas dispatch from the 21st reports: The "Progress Bullfighting Arena" in Guadalajara province, Mexico, advertised a program featuring a lion fighting a bull in moving language, aiming to attract a crowd. People were indeed moved and the arena was packed. However, when the event began, the so-called bull turned out to be a small calf, unable to fight. The lion immediately opened its jaws and devoured it. The audience realized they had been tricked and became enraged. They threw bricks and stones, some even fired pistols, and finally, they set the bullfighting arena on fire.

Spain is known for its bullfighting. Although the lion-versus-bull fight did not involve humans, the principle is the same, because the audience wants to see a bloody tragedy. In this case, the calf was unable to fight and the lion simply devoured it. Blood certainly flowed, but it was not moving enough, not tense enough. Since the lion-versus-bull fight could not satisfy their desires, they compensated by burning down the bullfighting arena.

Some people simply like to watch fires burn, but they call it "watching the fire from the other shore," which is a bit more "civilized" in name.

### Gamblers

— Yu Lu

—Shenzhen Notes—

One Saturday afternoon, a Guangzhou-Kowloon express train departed from Dashatou, roaring like a ravenous viper, speeding across the fields like a mad arrow. The locomotive relentlessly emitted smoke and howled its whistle. Soon, the train entered "Shilong Station," and just as quickly, it exited the platform, rushing forward without lingering.

Ahead lay a vast expanse of emerald green fields, with mountains, trees, and small rivers, both sides planted with rice paddies cultivated by farmers for the wealthy, swaying in the wind, a rather pleasant scene. This place, like most southern villages, exuded a charming, near-subtropical atmosphere. But none of these delightful sights captured the interest of the passengers on the train. Of course, they passed through here every Saturday, but they never paid attention to these things. Their minds were not so free to focus on the familiar...

So, where were their thoughts at this moment? Peering out from the train windows, wasn't it those telegraph poles, one after another, receding backward, receding quickly backward, one after another, one after another, quickly! No! Too slow, shouldn't it be faster?

Ahead lay their hope, they were contemplating the happiness there, a happiness that could not be described to others!

In the second-class carriage, there were not many passengers. Three or four red-haired people (Englishmen) were reading horizontal lines of English newspapers, wearing frameless gold-rimmed glasses. There were also one or two young couples, squeezed tightly together, with two small pieces of luggage lying on the floor: a small suitcase and a woman's handbag. The rest were those who leaned against the windows, against the walls, those who were not travelers, but contemplators.

The air was somewhat cold and quiet, thanks to this group of unspeaking fellows. Except for those couples whispering sweet nothings, talking endlessly, everyone else was silent. Those contemplators leaning against their seats seemed to share the same thoughts, all with the same posture. The posture was like this: their eyes were not looking at the sky, but focused on the bridge of their noses. Their eyeballs seemed fixed, or perhaps they were rolling around. Their minds were certainly not where their eyes were looking, but rather...

Far, far ahead! No, not so far, almost right in front of them. Soon, the express train would stop there, and at that moment they would think of nothing else, as long as they saw everything there, they would no longer be silent, contemplative people.

Perhaps they were reminiscing, most likely about last Saturday. They were very good at forgiving themselves: of course, it wasn't entirely their fault, it was fate playing tricks, fate had to make them "lose," how could they not lose, right? This time, they'd get back everything, including interest...

Some even had a hint of a smile on their lips, they were optimists, they treated the story of taking a third-class train back on Sunday night as a joke—a great man knows when to yield and when to stand tall! If they had good luck, with the Green Dragon, White Tiger, they'd win "solo": wouldn't they travel first class then? But, no matter what they said, none of these passengers ever returned to the provincial capital in first class.

Thinking, of course, could be done anywhere, but too much opportunity to think could also be troublesome. So, one of them anxiously asked his fellow traveler: "Hey, why isn't the train eating today? Still not at Shenzhen, it's killing people!"

"Two, four, one, one, one, still one, there's nothing you can do, it's not what you want!"—This answer was somewhat nonsensical, but they understood too much about these things, and didn't find it strange at all. They grinned, smiled, and then threw their thoughts out the window, towards Shenzhen. Only there would they have the leisure to chat idly; not here.

Suddenly, the whistle shrieked wildly. The shadow of a large shed flashed before them. The sound was unexpectedly loud, several Westerners glanced over with surprise. At this moment, the train slowed down and entered the platform. A sign with the station name rushed into their eyes. The conductor shouted loudly:

"Shenzhen! Shenzhen..."

Following that, everyone rushed down. The carriages were empty of those passengers who were not travelers.

### Bewilderment

— Wang Shengtian

My elderly mother sent a letter from the countryside, saying:

"...Shanghai women are no good. Didn't Ah Si fail to finish his studies because of a woman? I think you know that, and you're the most sensible of your brothers... The Zhang family has sent someone to propose marriage. I think you're already in your twenties. This marriage would be a good match..."

I don't want just a wife; I think I should have a companion. Prompted by this letter, I began to pay attention to "women"!

Every night, when I open my books and stay up late, I feel a sense of loneliness chasing after me. When I read Gorky's works, it seems like there are more female protagonists than usual, and they are written as so beautiful and charming; "Woman is the eternal mother of human sorrow," Gorky's words are constantly in my mind! I think, what the hell is this? But I don't have an answer!

Every day I still carry my satchel and go to school to meet the blackboard and chalk, hand in hand. Before, I was always alone in the teaching office, never joining in the colleagues' interesting chatter. When the bell rang, I taught my class, and then left. The other day, I heard an old colleague talking about women, and without thinking, I butted in and asked, "What's your opinion on women?"

"Haha..." He laughed when he heard me ask that question. After a while, he quietly glanced at me and said, "...A classmate of mine said that raising a woman is like buying a cow to drink milk... When you buy a cow, you have to provide it with housing, food, and care... and then you get milk to drink. But people who don't buy cows also get milk to drink. In Shanghai, you can get even fresher milk, whether it's the Butterfly brand or A-grade sterilized milk..."

When the sun sets, I drag my body back to my tiny room, knowing that it's early spring and soon it will be suffocatingly hot. Habits can be tiring and painful. From today on, I should give up those thoughts!

"What are women like? They are so beautiful, so gentle; I know Baudelaire wrote delicately about how they intoxicate people..."

This question remains unanswered. I am just confused, sometimes acting foolish so that I can forget it.

### Gathering of Famous Doctors

— Qun Ying

We know about the "All-Star Gala," where famous performers gather to sing their signature opera pieces. Watching such a gala is sure to be vibrant and uplifting!

Now, there's also a "Gathering of Famous Doctors." What's that all about? It turns out that famous doctors from Shanghai, such as renowned physicians and surgeons Diao Xinde, Tan Yili, Luo Chuanrong, Yu Xinyan, Wang Qiling, Weng Xuxiu, and Xu Xinbo; renowned venereologists Li Jingwen; renowned ophthalmologist Zhang Fuxing; renowned dentist Zhou Jiazhao; renowned gastroenterologist Zhu Baolin; renowned urologist Chen Bangdian; and renowned hemorrhoid specialist Ge Jing, are all hanging their shingles and providing consultations at the Wuzhou Building on Fourth Avenue. This is because the consulting rooms inside the Wuzhou Building have all been designed by experts. The complete consulting rooms allow the famous doctors to fully utilize their skills, and patients will know where to seek help.

### Boudoir Complaint

— Zhen Ni

The boudoir is where women reside. Because it is an inner room, it is also called the "deep boudoir." Women from respectable families are commonly called "boudoir beauties."

"Boudoir Complaint" refers to women's grievances. From ancient times to the present, women have always had more grievances than men. This is because women are more sedentary and less active, leading to physiological conditions such as irregular menstruation, physical weakness, and blood deficiency, all of which can lead them to a state of pessimism and melancholy. However, in ancient times, because medicine was not well-developed, many women in their boudoirs ended up dying with grievances! Nowadays, there are effective medicines. For example, taking "Monthly Red" can promote blood circulation, regulate menstruation, soothe the liver, and relieve depression, ensuring smooth and regular periods. Taking "Women's Treasure" can nourish blood, regulate menstruation, and tonify deficiencies, preserving youthful beauty. Both of these medicines are products of the Wuzhou Pharmacy.

...Yesterday, again, it was late at night, and I was drowsy, not expecting a small tabby cat to "meow..." by my bed, scaring me so much that I got up to check with a candle. The little tabby cat's paws were holding a mouse, its eyes staring at me, blood dripping, and when I put the candle on the table, I was struck as if by lightning, and I became clear-headed!

I looked at my watch, it was already two o'clock, and turning around in my room, I thought to myself, "It's going to be another sleepless night!"

I casually grabbed a book from the bookshelf, Chekhov's essays, and flipped to: "Women wither without male companions, men become clumsy without female companions!" "A man who cannot win a woman's heart with a kiss cannot take her heart by force."

### Gambling Raid

— Li Xuan

I was returning from my home and encountered heavy snow along the way. I arrived home at dusk, my hands and feet frozen stiff. My mother told me to lie on the heated kang to warm up properly. After lying there for a while, the frozen areas began to itch. I sneezed a couple of times, and my back still felt like it was covered in ice. My mother touched my head and said it was burning hot. I fell asleep in a daze.

As I slept, there was a commotion outside. I listened and the sound grew louder and louder. I impatiently poked my head out from under the covers and asked my mother:

"Why are they making such a racket?"

"They're gambling in the cart shed."

"Aren't they afraid of a gambling raid?"

"During the New Year holidays, they found some people and bribed the police in the Public Security Bureau."

"How much money?"

"Eight yuan a day for a pai gow game."

The noise grew even louder. Suddenly, there was a clatter and bang, mixed with:

"Shoot him!..."

"Catch him! Catch him! Grab his leg!"

Suddenly, a flash of light shot over my mother's shoulder, shining directly in my eyes. Then, a policeman rudely pulled me out of bed. I shuddered and quickly jumped off the kang, grabbed his arm, and asked:

"Why are you pulling me?"

He didn't answer a word, grabbed my cotton quilt and searched my pockets. There, I had four yuan and eighty cents. He flashed and stuffed it into his own crotch, turned around, grabbed my hair, and dragged me out the door.

My father was at the doorway arguing with that black-skinned rat (what we here call patrol officers "street-sneaking dogs" or "black-skinned rats"), pushing me, me pushing you, no one able to budge the other.

The patrol officer who was fighting with me, because I had been scolding him as a robber and made him angry, grabbed the sleeve of my jacket, heaving and panting, shouting:

"We'll go see the patrol captain! This is outrageous!"

I wanted to talk to him reasonably, so I followed him out to the outer room without even putting on my shoes. It turned out that the patrol captain was waiting outside the door. I told him that the kid had robbed my money and pulled my hair for no reason. He seemed to be deaf, pointing at me with one finger and shouting:

"Why don't you arrest him for me, arrest him!"

My father, blood dripping from his forehead, walked over and said:

"Patrol Captain, this son of mine just came home from out of town and has a fever. If there's anything big or small, I'll take care of it."

Like selling fish, a large group of gambling ghosts were tied together with hemp rope, the patrol officers whipping those who didn't want to walk. Some people were grumbling:

"I said I'd bet the last hand and leave, but you insisted on betting another side!"

"The dealer got four points and swept the board... Sigh, can you loosen the rope a little? Officers!"

"Shut your mother's mouth! Move along!"

On the third day, the bureau sent a notice saying to prepare six yuan for the fine. In the afternoon, my mother took her silver bracelets, which she had worn when she married, to the small pawnshop and exchanged them for five yuan. It wasn't until the street watchman beat the third watch of the night that my mother helped my father back home. Both of his thighs were swollen from the beating, saying it was because they were one yuan short of the fine. (Jidong Miscellany)

Opening Verse "Floral Moon Linked Pearls"

Spring River Flower Moon is most prosperous. Moon reflects flower wall, flowers and moon together. Flowers love moon, flowers love moon. Moon moves flower shadow, moon moves flower. Flowers bloom awaiting the moon, zither stops playing. Moon urges flowers to bloom, drums beat wildly. Fallen flowers fill the ground with golden characters. A crescent moon is like a jade hairpin. The flowery world is ever in spring. Monthly tides never fail. Bright moon, a round jade axe. Plum blossoms, three movements plucked on a brass pipa. Jiang Lang dreams of a flower-growing brush. Zhang Ziyou wanders on a moonlit raft. Face like peach blossom, eyebrows like moon. Moon in water, flower in mirror. May the old man in the moon spread the word of love. May the flower slave pick up phoenix hair. Worshipping the moon and burning incense, emotions are true. Burying flowers and jade, grief is boundless. Reeds, flowers, autumn moon, Xunyang traveler. Lonely moon, plum blossoms, recluse's home. Moon palace, sweeping with a pheasant-feather duster. Flower-lined steps, moonlit, phoenix-head shoes. Attempting to catch the moon in the water, it is all in vain. Watching flowers in the mist, pleasure arises naturally. Mast and moon, thinking of someone, sad moon pavilion. Wearing flowers on the head, walking the streets after passing the imperial exams. Chang'e lives in the moon palace. Jade maiden wipes the mirror with her iris flower. Wanting to roll up the pearl curtain to cage the night moon. Deleting bad deeds to nourish famous flowers. Fallen flowers, singing birds, spring sorrowful waters. Slanting moon, flickering lamps, late dreams. Planting flowers in the moon, guarding against rain's jealousy. Flowers bloom fully, moon peeks through clouds. Bees dance around the flowers while drinking wine. Xiao played in the moon cave, drawing phoenixes in harmony. Moon as a heavy quilt, flowers as a pillow. Flowers as the four walls, the moon as home. Heavenly flowers fall in disorder, blinding flower shadows. Autumn moon is often round, watching the moonlight. Cold moon, remnant wind, spring is desolate. Idle flowers, fallen willows, roads crisscross. White clouds, ten thousand miles, mountain pass moon. Green blood, a thousand years, emperor's flower. Moon without flowers is truly less interesting. Flowers without moon is quiet and still. From now on. Spending the years in flowery mornings and moonlit evenings.

Lyrics of "Swallows Fly Together"

Swallows fly together. Late at night, people are gone, the evening wind is cold. Remembering last year's lane. The scenery is vaguely familiar. Green garden. Fine rain dampens the moss. Cold dust on carved beams, spring like a dream. And holding mud in its beak. Rebuilding a new nest by the green canopy. Dwelling and remembering. Whispering about the evening glow. Staggered scissors. Skimming across the water, threading the curtains, trying to return. The soul clings to the weak willows. Dreams linger on the apricot blossoms. The grass on the horizon is fragrant. The building is quiet. The curtains hang. The smoke is woven. The moon is like eyebrows. But the fragrance fades quickly. The nightingales and flowers age. The rain and wind urge. The scenery is completely different. The cuckoo calls out, saying it's better to return.

### Leftover Sounds

The Zhongnan Tobacco Company of this city has been established for many years and enjoys an outstanding reputation. It is one of the largest Chinese-owned cigarette factories. Recently, in order to promote economic construction and inspire national respect for leaders, it specially produced "Leader Brand Cigarettes" using high-quality tobacco leaves. As soon as they were launched, they caused a sensation in society. People from all walks of life praised them unanimously, deeming them worthy of the "cigarette leader" title. To celebrate with all sectors of society, they are specially broadcasting a performance at the Great World China Radio Station, featuring renowned artists. Today's program includes humorous performances by Liu Chunshan, Sheng Daidai, Cheng Xiaoting, Guan Wuling, Jiang Xiaoxiao, Lu Xixi, and others, promising exceptional entertainment. The station's frequency is 1080 kHz, and the telephone number is 82681.

The Yuanchang Advertising Company of this port has been established for ten years. Previously, to promote social education and expand its business, it established a radio station, initially broadcasting at a frequency of 840 kHz, later changed to 1120 kHz. At that time, because all broadcasting frequencies were already fully allocated, the company shared the same frequency with the Asian Sound Radio Station of this city, which has continued until now for many years. Now, the Yuanchang Radio Station, in order to increase educational and other excellent programs, has specially applied to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to exclusively use a frequency of 1480 kHz for broadcasting starting from March 1st, thus increasing the broadcast range.

Following the public solicitation for members by the Shanghai Society in this newspaper on the 24th of this month, many people from all walks of life have sent letters and visited our office requesting to join. Due to the quota being full, many have made wasted trips, for which we sincerely apologize. Currently, there is still one vacancy for a female member. Those wishing to join can come to our office at 851 Beijing Road. Additionally, the distribution of "Beautiful Woman" songs by our society has been slightly delayed due to excessive requests. We hope for understanding from all sectors.

Movies

### Amateur Dramatic Club Holds a Night of Song and Dance

The Amateur Dramatic Club of Shanghai held a "Night of Song and Dance" at the Lyceum Theatre the night before last. The program was extremely exciting, so despite the rain, Chinese and foreign guests continued to arrive. The first program was Shakespeare's famous play "The Merchant of Venice," with the actors all being foreigners. The second program, such as "Xiaoqing's Hanging Shadow," "Autumn Moon in the Han Palace," "Chang'e Flies to the Moon," and "Hongluan Wedding," were purely sung by Chinese artists. "Xiaoqing's Hanging Shadow" was a Cantonese opera, sung in ancient costume by Madam Liu, with a beautiful background and crisp singing, earning applause from the audience. "Autumn Moon in the Han Palace" was a Cantonese music piece, with instruments including pipa, yangqin, xiao, and erhu, creating a wonderful, varied melody. "Chang'e Flies to the Moon" was a beautiful dance drama starring Madam Dong. "Hongluan Wedding" was similar to Xiong Shiyi's adaptation of "Wang Baochuan." This play featured excellent singing and acting, and the plot was particularly tightly woven, making it the most moving program of the evening.

### Cathay Presents "Founding Heroes"

A Great and Thrilling Historical Patriotic Epic

Cecil Rhodes is to Africa what Clive is to India (the film "Clive of India" starring Colman, which tells the story of Clive, has already been shown in Shanghai), both being great British colonial heroes. Rhodes, with a sick body, traveled far to South Africa, managing and operating there with all his efforts. Although doctors warned him that his death was near, he didn't care. When strong enemies hindered his plans, he was never afraid. He finally grasped the authority of diamond mines, won the hearts of countless women, conquered the wilderness, created an empire, changed the color of the world map, and left a legacy that would last forever. The film "Rhodes of Africa," which opens today at the Cathay Theatre, depicts Rhodes' life-long struggle in South Africa and the fierce racial wars of the time. The role of Rhodes is played by first-class superstar Walter Huston, who gives a vivid performance. It is said that the film was shown for two consecutive weeks in major theaters in New York and Los Angeles, with great box office success, causing a sensation, which is enough to prove the film's true value.

### Scenes from "Wealth and Glory"

"Wealth and Glory," although a comedy from beginning to end, contains many very serious patriotic scenes.

The best way to satirize the dark side of society is to present it imperceptibly, and "Wealth and Glory" has done this.

The performance of "Wealth and Glory" is done in a completely relaxed manner, so it is more easily accepted by the audience.

People with money should use it properly. "Wealth and Glory" satirizes misers and tells people how to use money.

Director Wen Yimin did not even rest on Lunar New Year's Eve to rush to film "Wealth and Glory," truly a devotee of art.

### Free "Chasing Han Xin" Script

The Drama News Weekly, which will be published on the 28th, specializes in anecdotes from the drama scene, gossip about female actors, news from the theater world, and news from "film," "dance," and "radio stations." It retails for five cents per copy. Currently, readers are offered a special discount: send five jiao (0.50) in legal tender to the circulation department of the Drama News Agency at 92 Xinyuanji Lane, Tangshan Road, American Concession, Shanghai, to subscribe to ten issues, postage paid, and receive a free copy of the famous actor Qilin Tong's "Chasing Han Xin" script, limited to one hundred copies. At the same time, in order to enrich the content, the company is soliciting several special reporters from this city and other cities. Please submit three trial articles first and contact us by letter to arrange an interview. The salary is generous.
