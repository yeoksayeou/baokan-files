### Anglo-Japanese Rivalry in the South Pacific

Japanese Influence Moving South; Britain Actively Defending

[Washington] The Foreign Policy Association today published a paper titled "Anglo-Japanese Rivalry in Southeast Asia," which stated that Japan's economic power in Southeast Asia has forced Britain to adopt a protective attitude towards the French, Dutch, and Portuguese territories there. Japan's southward policy has endangered the colonial interests of European countries. The Dutch East Indies is most suitable for Japan's commercial expansion. The Netherlands is weak and unable to take care of its territory in the Far East, and the position of the East Indian archipelago is between Singapore and Australia and New Zealand. Britain will naturally strive to maintain the status quo. The territories of France and Portugal are also very close to British territory. If occupied by an enemy country, the danger would be great, and both countries would not be able to resist the strong enemy in Asia. Recently, rumors of Japan and Norway signing an agreement to build a canal have been rampant. Therefore, Britain is very willing to spend a huge sum of 350 million US dollars to increase the strength of the Pacific Fleet. (22nd National Telegram)

Hydrogen Touching Electric Fire; Dr. Eckener's Statement

Lakehurst, USA: Regarding the destruction of the German airship "Hindenburg" at this airfield, according to the famous Zeppelin pilot Dr. Eckener's statement at the investigation court, the cause of the accident was likely due to sparks in the air and broken iron hoops.

### Three Major Construction Issues in Yunnan

— Our Reporter Geng Ya

Developing Transportation and Resources while Promoting Education in Border Areas; Local Finances are Insufficient, Hoping for Central Government Assistance

In recent years, military and political unity has been achieved in Yunnan, and the local area is relatively stable. Under the guidance of the central government, the provincial authorities have been actively working on construction projects, such as politics, economy, education, and transportation, all of which have seen significant and commendable achievements. Statistics show that the total cost of various construction projects has exceeded 100 billion national currency units. Such a massive expenditure is, of course, directly and indirectly borne by the local people, as the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep." Moreover, the entire province is enforcing smoking bans and land surveys. On the one hand, farmers have lost an extra source of income from smoking, and on the other hand, they have to pay for land survey certificates. As a result, the agricultural economy has become like a cantaloupe that cannot be picked again!

I have visited various counties and villages to investigate, and I deeply feel that Yunnan Province is not necessarily poor, but relying solely on the local people to develop it is apparently not enough. Therefore, the livelihoods of farmers remain very difficult. Now that the foundation for domestic stability has been laid, and efforts are being made to build up national defense, the central government should provide practical assistance to Yunnan's construction projects related to the national economy and the people's livelihood as much as possible, to meet the hopes of the border residents.

In the future, there are three construction projects that Yunnan urgently needs to undertake in terms of economy and culture, which are related to the country's substantial unity and the consolidation of the national defense foundation, as follows:

First, expedite the construction of the Yunnan-Burma, Yunnan-Guizhou, and Yunnan-Guangdong railways. From the perspective of the country, this is not only about unblocking the main arteries of the southwestern provinces, but also about opening up a sea and land outlet for the rear of national defense.

From Yunnan's perspective, it is even more beneficial. Before the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, it took more than two months to travel from Kunming to Nanjing. Even with the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, it still took 14 or 15 days to reach Annam and then transfer by sea. Moreover, the control of the railway is in the hands of foreigners, and passengers, even with international passports, are often obstructed. As for the transportation of domestic goods, the transit tax is particularly heavy. According to Lu Yongheng, the former Finance Director of the Provincial Committee, the reason why Yunnan's finances and finance were chaotic in the past was because of the fatal injury inflicted by this railway. Before 1927 (i.e., during Tang Jiyao's administration), the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway used the net profit from its operations to exchange cash for Yunnan currency with the provincial government, reaching more than 200,000 yuan per month. Later, as cash gradually became scarce, it was changed to buying French currency to pay tribute to the French. As a result, the French currency rose sharply, while the Yunnan currency depreciated, falling to a dozen yuan of Yunnan currency to exchange for one yuan of French currency. After the establishment of the new provincial government in 1928, the finance had already been disrupted by the French Banque de l'Indochine, and the finance suffered greatly. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway's currency exchange issue could not be resolved. Initially, it was reduced, and then it was virtually eliminated. However, in reality, the net profit that the railway should have earned continued to be earned steadily. If our country builds the main railway lines in the southwest, who would be willing to seek help from others and spend money to suffer grievances? Such a large outflow of profits can certainly be recovered without any doubt.

Based on the above, the local authorities have repeatedly suggested to the central government that it should be approved to build the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway first. The proposed route has three lines: upper, middle, and lower. The lower line runs from Kunming via Qujing, Luliang, Luoping, Jiangdi (Yunnan-Guizhou border), Xingyi, Anlong, Anshun, Qingzhen, and reaches Guiyang. During the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, French businessmen wanted to operate the Qinyu Railway (from Qinzhou, Guangdong, via Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan to Chongqing, Sichuan, about 1,700 kilometers long). In 1914, Yuan Shikai signed a loan agreement with the Sino-French Industrial Bank for 600 million French francs, of which 100 million French francs had been used by the Preparatory Committee. The French operated this railway and did not allow it to be transferred to other countries to prevent the British from competing for expansion. However, after construction, they feared that it would affect the interests of the Yunnan Railway, so it was delayed and not built. In 1929, the Ministry of Railways also sent people to survey a section (from Kunming to Anlong), saying that Luliang, which it passed through, was rich in coal mines and had waterfalls that could be used for power generation. Therefore, the official surveying team sent by the Ministry of Railways this time suspected that this line would be used for convenience. However, the route is too circuitous, forming a large arc, which is not only uneconomical to construct, but also requires more time and expense in transportation. Moreover, Luliang's coal production is not valuable in Yunnan Province, which is extremely rich in coal reserves; how much power can the waterfall generate is also questionable. Therefore, the local authorities strongly advocate selecting the following upper and middle lines: the upper line runs from Kunming via Qujing, Xuanwei, enters Guizhou via Shuicheng, Jinsha, and connects to the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway to Zunyi. It can go south to Guiyang and north to the Yangtze River. The route is straight, and construction is also convenient. The middle line runs from Kunming via Qujing, Luliang, Luoping, enters Guizhou via Xingren, Zhenfeng, Anshun, and reaches Guiyang. The route is even straighter, and construction is easier. The Ministry of Railways has now understood all the circumstances and has decided to survey and select the upper and middle lines. Construction can begin once the route is determined.

Second, what Yunnan hopes the central government can help with is the development of resources and the implementation of industrial construction. Yunnan is located on a plateau, with vast territory and abundant mineral reserves, which are known as the "two new gold mines" by the British and French. When Chairman Chiang visited Yunnan last time, he also gave instructions to strive to develop Yunnan's mineral resources in order to turn Yunnan into a national industrial zone. The Yunnan shovels that have been mined with success, such as copper, tin, antimony, and tungsten, are all essential metals for national defense industries. The remaining ones that have been discovered but not exploited on a large scale, such as silver and iron, and other precious metals, are almost all available. In terms of plants, due to the north-south alignment of the mountains, the Indian Ocean monsoon can enter directly, with abundant rainfall and a suitable climate; coupled with good geology and fertile soil. Therefore, natural forests are everywhere; there are many varieties, which are unparalleled in the world. The development of these resources requires the active assistance of the central government and the enthusiastic investment of capitalists from all over the country.

Third, what Yunnan hopes the central government can help with is the expansion of education in the border areas. The southwest border of Yunnan Province borders Burma and Annam, and the transportation is distant, reaching 30 or 40 stations from the provincial capital. The ethnic groups are complex, and the customs are different. The provincial government's orders sometimes cannot reach, resulting in a weak national concept among the border residents, and foreign political, economic, and cultural aggression is rampant. To give a small example: the "Qiuzi" in the Qiujiang area are reluctant to take on any official business assigned to them by the county government or the administrative bureau; however, if foreign missionaries, such as priests or pastors, want to travel anywhere, they will be eagerly welcomed and compete to carry their sedan chairs, flattering "period ticks".

Although Yunnan has received some financial assistance from the central government in the past to run a simple normal school and 33 Miao people's primary schools in the border areas, the border area where Yunnan borders British and French territories is as wide as 31 counties and districts; the border population is as large as 1.4 million or more, and the average number of people who receive education is actually less than 1%. The remaining 99% of the border residents, that is, the Miao people who occupy an important position in Yunnan's population, are excluded from the country's education plan, but the foreign missionaries who "cannot be obtained" welcome them to the church like welcoming ancestors! If you don't believe it, please read the Church's report on border education issues:

The report roughly states: "In Lancang County, more than 2,000 li away from the provincial capital, British missionary Yong Weili and his son have been preaching there for more than 30 years. They have established 31 schools and 226 gospel preaching centers in the Kava Mountain and Luoli Mountain areas, with about 38,000 church members. Each school has dozens to hundreds of students, all of whom are provided with food, accommodation, clothing, books, and stationery. In Cheli, which is even farther than Lancang, British missionaries Goodnow, etc., are proficient in the Xiyu and Yikava 'Luohei' dialects and have established hospitals and schools, also buying people's hearts and carrying out 麻醉 education. In the county and district along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, French missionaries also select outstanding children of the local aborigines to learn French and send them to Paris for study at public expense. In Lunan County, there are already 16 people." The schools and preaching centers run by British missionaries in one county have exceeded the number of border education schools in all 31 counties and districts by hundreds of times. Moreover, many of the church schools they run have abolished Chinese and replaced it with Burmese or Romanized textbooks. It can be seen that their cultural aggression is very cunning, more concrete and sharp than in other provinces in the interior. Therefore, the importance of developing border education in Yunnan in the future is not only a matter of assimilation, but also a fundamental issue of national defense.

### German Government Encourages Childbirth

Implementing Marriage Loan System

This is a report from Berlin. Among the various measures taken by Germany to encourage the increase of its national population, the most important one is the marriage loan system. Many young people use this loan to organize their families. According to official statistics, from August 1, 1936, to February 1, 1937, 700,000 couples married with this loan in six months. The average loan amount per couple is 600 marks, and the state has loaned a total of 420,000,000 marks. One of the conditions for obtaining this loan is that the bride must withdraw from the job industry to slightly reduce the congestion in the labor market. On the other hand, the industry that manufactures household appliances and furnishings can also prosper accordingly. As of February 1, 650,000 women have withdrawn from the job industry due to requests for marriage loans, thereby reducing the cost of rescuing unemployed workers by about 375,000,000 marks. Moreover, the increase in loan consumption and the increase in tax revenue are just the beginning. In addition, the most important effect of the marriage loan system is the increase in fertility rate, because this loan does not collect interest and only withdraws 1% of the principal per month. If a child is born, the principal can be reduced by 25%. This is the greatest driving force to induce married men and women to strive for childbirth. As of February 1, the loan couples have given birth to a total of 500,000 children, which is about twice the fertility rate of the same number of non-loan couples in the same period. As for the money needed by the government to set up this loan, it comes from the increased revenue from the single tax. The number of successive returns is used to relieve families with too many children and very little income, called special subsidies. From the end of October 1935 to the end of January 1937, a total of 350,000 households received this special subsidy, with an average amount of about 350 marks per household. The government spent about 123,000 marks on this, benefiting nearly 2 million children. This is another byproduct of the marriage loan system. (National Haitong Telegram)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Japan's Policy Toward China

— Yi

Since the breakdown of the Zhang Qun-Kawagoe negotiations last winter, Japan has consistently appeared hesitant in its diplomacy toward China. Recently, according to a report by the Allied News Agency, the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy of Japan had a discussion on China policy based on the report of Ambassador Kawagoe after his return to the country. After Senator Mori U of the Japanese Embassy in China returns to Tokyo, the three ministries will convene another meeting to review the China policy with "mutual benefit and equality" as the core. The formal decision will be a directive personally handed over by Foreign Minister Sato to Ambassador Kawagoe, which he will follow after returning to his post next month. There is a possibility that negotiations for adjusting diplomatic relations between China and Japan will be revived.

Whether these future new negotiations between China and Japan can proceed smoothly, of course, depends on the nature of Japan's new policy toward China before it can be judged. Japanese government officials have repeatedly stated that they are willing to support China's unity, and the new China policy to be reviewed by the three ministries certainly carries the facade of "mutual benefit and equality." However, the Lin Cabinet is willing to be a tool of the military's pro-Nazi forces, regardless of the opposition of the people, and the Japanese army in Kwantung and North China has recently intensified its activities in the Chabei and Jidong areas. These are all obvious facts before us. Under these circumstances, how can we expect the current Japanese government to fundamentally change its China policy? In the past six months, the strength of the Chinese government and people has indeed made the Japanese authorities realize clearly due to the suppression of the anti-Japanese resistance in the north and the pacification of the Shaanxi rebellion. However, the role of this understanding in Japanese diplomacy is still very limited. According to the latest news revealed by Tokyo newspapers, the authorities of the Japanese Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy Ministries have the following common opinions after listening to Ambassador Kawagoe's report: ① Closely monitor the development of the potential influence of the Communist Party in China; ② Use the issue of economic cooperation as the initial step in adjusting negotiations on diplomatic relations between China and Japan; ③ Advise China to temporarily put aside the issues of Jidong and Chabei; ④ Prevent the Chinese government from being manipulated by the forces of the pro-American powers and avoid friction with the powers related to the Far East. From these few opinions, it can be seen that the Japanese authorities still adhere to the spirit of the Hirota Three Principles, and the so-called "new understanding of China" only makes them intend to adopt more subtle and cunning means in diplomacy.

The diplomatic policy that the Japanese authorities are preparing to adopt in the reopened negotiations with China has not yet been finalized. However, based on the current situation, there are already two key points that can be presumed. First, in the negotiations with China, emphasis should be placed on economic cooperation issues. Second, diplomacy toward China should be integrated with diplomacy toward Britain. Regarding the first point, our country can, of course, welcome goodwill economic cooperation. However, what our country currently needs in the development of national power is construction materials and industrial machinery, while Japan is experiencing a steel panic. Can we expect Japan to provide us with this need? Judging from past facts, the biggest goal that Japan holds in economic cooperation is simply to exchange industrial products for our country's industrial raw materials. It is very obvious how this is beneficial or harmful to our country's economic future. Regarding the first point, Japan has recently been considering dividing spheres of influence in China with Britain. Tokyo newspapers have even put forward the alarming slogan of "North China for Japan, South China for Britain." This one-sided attempt may have moved the British people years ago. However, after the September 18th Incident, Britain has learned several serious lessons, and its understanding of the situation in the Far East is very different from before. It should not accept this absurd proposition. Yesterday, British Foreign Minister Eden said to special envoy Kung that "If Britain negotiates with any country in the Pacific, it must take China's interests into account in this negotiation." We trust this guarantee. We also trust that our government will adhere to the position of maintaining independent sovereignty.

In short, if Japan cannot get rid of those illusions of only caring about one-sided interests in future negotiations with China, then the diplomatic relations between China and Japan will still be bleak.

### Air Chamber Exploration Successfully Plants Russian Flag in the Arctic

The US State Department states that it will not cause sovereignty issues

[Washington] After the Soviet Russian explorer Professor Schmidt led an air expedition, flew to the North Pole and planted the Soviet Russian flag there, the US State Department recently declared that this move would not cause sovereignty issues. When US Navy Rear Admiral Peary arrived at the North Pole on April 6, 1909, although he firmly held the US flag, the US did not thereby determine sovereignty over the area. What the Soviet Russian air expedition team has done now is also the same. As for which country the sovereignty of the area belongs to, the United States will reserve the right to speak when it is discussed in the future. (Havas Telegram from Central News Agency, 22nd)

⊙ Boston, USA After the Soviet Russian air expedition team, led by Professor Schmidt, flew over the North Pole yesterday, US Rear Admiral Byrd, a famous Antarctic explorer, recently released a statement to the press, roughly stating that the team's achievements are great, and its courage is combined. As for all the preparations before departure, they are extremely thorough and commendable. From what I have seen, the ice floe on which the team is based near the North Pole will soon flow to Spitsbergen (in the Arctic Ocean) or Greenland. Therefore, the team's stationed location must be changed at any time in the direction of the American Alaskan Peninsula, so that it is not too far from the North Pole. Especially in the summer, the large ice floes in the Arctic Ocean will gradually melt, or they may encounter difficulties. Also, regarding the Arctic Ocean situation, we do not know much about the movement of ice floes. What is known is that the distance of the movement must be very considerable, but the team is well-equipped and will be able to overcome various difficulties. (Havas Telegram from Central News Agency, 22nd)

Report of the Expedition

[Moscow] Scholar Schmidt reported: "We have spent a day at the Soviet Arctic Ocean Station at the North Pole. Five tents have been built on the ice floe, a radio station, and scientific instruments have also been arranged. The first meteorological observation results have been sent to Moscow on schedule, greatly increasing our knowledge of climate prediction. The climate here is quite warm, but only twelve degrees below zero, the sun is warm, and the breeze blows snow. We have unloaded and unpacked part of the supplies brought by the plane, and the team members feel comfortable. After working for 24 hours, we fell asleep in warm sleeping bags. Five members of the team have experienced the Chelyuskin incident and unconsciously recall the last experience. We have conquered nature and avenged the sinking of the Chelyuskin. We can carry out the tasks set by Stalin and create a long-term base for science and aviation in the Arctic. I am very pleased." (TASS Telegram of the 22nd)

Russian Newspapers Unanimously Praise

[Moscow] All Soviet newspapers have published articles praising the success of this Arctic air expedition. The News stated: "This victory in conquering the Arctic is a synthesis of the entire long-term struggle of the Bolsheviks to attack the Arctic Ocean. From today onwards, the Arctic has a Soviet scientific colony, a base for the Arctic Ocean route, and an airfield for Arctic Ocean aviation. We have conquered the Arctic, the power of socialist technology, the bravery of the Soviet people, the excellence of the aircraft, the heroism and perseverance of the children of the Soviet nation, and the wisdom of the great Soviet leaders who put forward this brilliant plan to conquer the Arctic, have jointly conquered the Arctic. The Soviet red flag is flying over the pole." The Truth stated: "The Bolsheviks have firmly and decisively recovered the north. The strong technology of socialism has strengthened the attack on the Arctic Ocean. Soviet explorers have increasingly moved northward. They have opened up aviation and shipping lines at the highest latitudes and most remote corners of the Arctic Ocean. Scientists, administrators, and political workers immediately followed this route."

The newspaper reviewed the history of Arctic exploration and said, "Great explorers from capitalist countries have repeatedly reached the North Pole, but they lack the strength and means to organize scientific work at the pole. The Arctic was discovered long ago, but it has not been used to serve science and mankind. Soviet explorers will solve this problem. All the people of our great motherland warmly congratulate the brave warriors currently stationed at the northernmost end of the world. We are very impressed by their heroism, decisiveness, and Bolshevik perseverance in overcoming severe natural obstacles." (TASS Telegram of the 22nd)

### Fourth Pan-Pacific Women's Conference

To be convened in Canada in mid-July; Japanese representatives have been decided

[Tokyo] The Fourth Pan-Pacific Women's Conference will be held in Canada from July 12 to 22. More than 300 women representatives from the Pacific coastal countries, including China, Japan, the United States, Canada, and the Philippines, will discuss the following issues:

① Issues related to promoting peace in the Pacific, ② Issues related to labor and living standards, ③ Pacific population and immigration issues, ④ Public health issues, ⑤ Social progress and education issues, ⑥ Overseas prostitution issues,

Representatives Komai and Matsuoka are scheduled to leave Yokohama on June 29 on the Heian Maru to Canada. (Xiangyan Telegram of the 23rd)

### Right-Wing Reformists Visit Prime Minister Hayashi

Advise Taking Strong Measures to Deal with Established Political Parties

[Tokyo] Representatives of the reformist faction supporting the Hayashi cabinet, Lieutenant Generals Tatekawa and Kobayashi, visited Prime Minister Hayashi yesterday, attracting attention from all sides. In the afternoon, House of Peers member Iida Iwanao and Colonel Kobayashi Jun'ichirō also met with the Prime Minister, questioned him about his beliefs regarding the current situation, and expressed their views. They stated that existing political parties have caused the Japanese parliament to lose its essence, and the government should take strong measures against this, fundamentally revising the current election law and recommending the parliament be dissolved again to improve the nature of political parties. The Hayashi cabinet held a general election for this purpose, so there is no need for a total resignation now. The two strongly advised the Prime Minister to remain in office and left after an hour. This action by the right-wing reformists naturally forms a confrontation with the cabinet overthrow movement of the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties, and their future is quite noteworthy. (23rd, Domei News)

Kamakura: Prime Minister Hayashi, while at his villa in Kamakura today, discussed the current situation with reporters. When asked when the appointment of cabinet members would be realized, the Prime Minister replied that the political situation had not yet stabilized and he would observe the situation for a while before proceeding with the appointments. When asked if the dissolution of the Showakai was not originally initiated by the current cabinet, the Prime Minister replied that he was unaware of the dissolution of the Showakai beforehand, and the government had never considered dissolving political parties. When asked if the new party issue seemed to be reigniting, and whether he intended to actively promote the formation of a party, the Prime Minister replied that the new party movement was not initiated by the government, and he had no intention of actively forming a party. When asked if the political parties' united front was carrying out a cabinet overthrow movement, making the political atmosphere very unstable, and whether the government still wanted to maintain the status quo under these circumstances, the Prime Minister replied that there was no other way than to deal with the necessary policies for the current situation. When asked how the government would handle it if the political parties proposed a motion of no confidence in the government at the beginning of the special session of parliament, the Prime Minister replied that he would consider it carefully and then make the most resolute decision. When asked if the so-called resolution was a total resignation or a dissolution of parliament, the Prime Minister replied that it could not be decided without considering the reasons for the motion of no confidence. When asked about the political parties' claim that overthrowing the current cabinet was the general will of the people, the Prime Minister replied that it might be the opinion of the majority, but it was also possible that during the general election, the number of people who abstained in major cities reached as high as 50%, and there were also quite a few election law violation incidents. These points needed to be examined in detail. As a result, if it was known that the elected officials were capable and had a correct understanding of the current situation, then the government would have to consider it. (23rd, Domei News)

### Finance Minister Yūki Discusses Japanese Finance

Sluggish Absorption of Public Bonds Considered a Temporary Phenomenon

⊙Yamagata: Finance Minister Yūki returned to his hometown to visit his family graves. He arrived in Akayō Town, Yamagata Prefecture, on the 22nd and spoke to people as follows:

Regarding the price problem, the Price Countermeasures Committee has already decided on a general plan at its first meeting. In the future, a special committee will draft the original plan for the organization and distribution of pig iron, coal, and important industries. The Minister of Commerce and Industry will present this plan at the second meeting on the 28th. It is true that the sales of public bonds are not going well now, but this is a temporary phenomenon that naturally appears when there is a strong demand for funds in the industrial sector. From a broader perspective, I am confident that Japan's economic strength will be able to overcome all obstacles hindering the absorption of public bonds. As for the gold transfer issue, some people worry about its excessive amount, but this is also a temporary phenomenon. The authorities have their own ways to improve the international balance of payments situation and will be able to maintain it within the scope of domestic new gold production in the long run. Currently, the administrative authorities are studying the issue of issuing "savings bonds with a 10% premium," the purpose of which is to encourage general public savings and avoid wasteful spending, which will not have any adverse effects on bank deposits. The excess of imports over exports in the first half of this year reached more than 500 million yuan, which was the result of speculative imports. It is expected that this excess of imports over exports will be reduced during the export season in the second half of the year. (23rd, Domei News)

### U.S. Secretary of State Calls for World Peace

Disarmament and Joint Economic Cooperation - Hull's Speech Apparently Directed at Britain and Italy

[Washington] Today is the last day of International Trade Week, Maritime Trade Day. Secretary of State Hull delivered a speech, heavily criticizing countries that only seek self-sufficiency, calling them detrimental to international trade and world peace, and warning the leaders of these countries not to let their people degenerate into poverty. Although State Department officials said that Hull's remarks were not directed at any particular country, observers generally believe that he was criticizing Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's statement last week that Italy was determined to achieve complete economic self-sufficiency, and the fact that Mussolini disregarded the U.S. reciprocal trade agreement policy also made officials here quite dissatisfied. (22nd, National Telegram)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull made a radio speech today, saying that now is the time to convene all the countries of the world and ask them to dismantle their spiritual, political, military, and economic armaments. Hull did not embrace isolationism this time, urging all countries to adjust international relations based on friendship, cooperation, and fair negotiations. According to some listeners, Hull used the terms "nations" or "group of nations" this time, avoiding plans that lead to self-sufficiency and separation from the rest of the world, referring to the British Imperial Conference. However, some listeners said that it was noteworthy that Hull made these remarks one week after Mussolini announced that Italy would strive to achieve economic self-sufficiency. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Reuters)

[Washington] Negotiations between Britain and the United States on reciprocal trade agreements have now come to a standstill because the British Imperial Conference has not yet produced concrete results. American experts' attention is focused on how the various autonomous regions in London will reform the imperial commercial policy and how they will approach free trade between Britain and the United States. U.S. authorities are currently unwilling to express any optimism, because although U.S. Secretary of State Hull's advocacy of world peace through more free international trade has gained supporters in London, such as Canadian Prime Minister King and British Minister of Commerce Runciman, the strong imperialist sentiment is still opposing opening the doors of industries that are comparatively younger, fearing that the large quantities of goods produced in the United States will take advantage of the situation and leave no room for British products.

### The Political Axis of Italy and Germany is Sufficient to Endanger Peace in Western Europe

British Foreign Secretary Advises Autonomous Regions to Temporarily Withhold Economic Assistance

[London] According to responsible sources, when Foreign Secretary Eden explained the diplomatic situation at the British Imperial Conference in recent days, he strongly advised the autonomous regions that the political axis formed by Italy and Germany was sufficient to endanger peace in Western Europe. Therefore, it is not appropriate to propose the idea of economic cooperation to these countries at present. This was agreed upon by the autonomous regions. When the consolidation of the political axis of Italy and Germany is confirmed, it is best to postpone cooperation with these countries on economic matters. In addition, responsible sources also stated that German Defense Minister General von Blomberg recently took advantage of attending the King's coronation ceremony to hold talks with British authorities. The outcome of the talks was quite favorable to the British side. Some cabinet members therefore advocated getting closer to Italy and Germany. However, the British government will postpone action on this matter and, if necessary, provide economic assistance to the one of the two countries that is less dangerous. Although the autonomous regions have not yet made a final decision, they will eventually accept Britain's views and do not intend to insist on immediately providing economic assistance to Germany, and they agree that Britain should first conclude a trade agreement with the United States as a plan to promote international trade. Responsible sources also stated that Australian Prime Minister Lyons will submit a memorandum on the Pacific issue and provide a detailed explanation of his proposal that countries along the Pacific coast conclude a non-aggression pact. According to British sources, they have not expressed welcome to this proposal. The reason for this is that they do not want Japan to feel that Britain is eagerly trying to form a Pacific pact, and they fear that the existing good relations between Britain and China may be harmed as a result.

### League of Nations Council to Meet Today

British Government Authorizes Eden to Handle Various Issues as He Sees Fit

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to go to Geneva tonight to attend the regular session of the League of Nations Council and the special session of the General Assembly. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources recently stated that the cabinet has granted the Foreign Secretary broad powers to handle six issues as he sees fit:

㊀ The issue of Egypt joining the League of Nations. This should not cause any difficulties. ㊁ The issue of the administrative system of the Sanjak region within Syria. Mediation will be carried out when disputes arise between France and Turkey. ㊂ When the Spanish Republican government's complaint about foreign interference in the civil war is submitted for discussion, it should be argued that it is more appropriate for the London Adjustment Committee to handle it. ㊃ Regarding the Western European Pact, Foreign Secretary Eden should declare that if Italy and Germany insist on establishing this pact outside the scope of the League of Nations, it will be extremely difficult to reach a solution. ㊄ Regarding whether the Emperor of Abyssinia, Selassie, should send representatives to attend the League of Nations General Assembly, Britain is unwilling to submit it for discussion, but if other countries raise this matter, then although Britain can acknowledge that the Abyssinian government no longer actually exists, it should refuse to recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia in law. ㊅ Regarding the publication of military budget of various countries, Britain believes that it can only take effect if the various dictatorial countries participate. However, since Germany has already withdrawn from the League of Nations, and Italy is in practice refusing to participate in the work of the League of Nations, this issue will be difficult to progress for the time being.

### Italian Prime Minister Gradually Shows Weariness of Interfering in the Spanish Civil War

Failures on the Front Line Are the Biggest Reason - Blaming France and Russia for Breaking the Agreement

[Paris] A correspondent from the right-wing Figaro newspaper in Rome recently stated that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is already tired of the Spanish issue. He has not expressed hostility to the mediation plan proposed by the British government. The reasons for this are no more than the following three: ㊀ Many Italian volunteers fighting on the Madrid and Bilbao front lines have been reported missing, causing unease among their families at home, and they have expressed dissatisfaction with the intervention in the Spanish civil war. ㊁ Germany recently advised the Italian authorities that it would be best to stay out of the matter. ㊂ The Spanish Nationalist Army has made many mistakes in politics and military strategy, which has greatly disappointed the Italian government.

[London] Regarding the issue of promoting the cessation of the Spanish civil war, although London has received a reply from the German government expressing great sympathy, the Italian newspaper Giornale d'Italia today published an article by Gayda, stating that the non-intervention policy has now been broken, and France and Russia should be held responsible for the damage. It is generally believed that Gayda is the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and his words have made the British feel the vagueness of the future. Gayda has listed the events and dates of the damage, which are said to be based on information from the government. It is said that between the end of April and the beginning of May, several ships loaded with 31 tons of bullets disguised as "condensed milk" were transported into Spain, and several tons of explosives disguised as "carbonates" were also transported into Spain one after another. Furthermore, Spanish coastal fishing boats engaged in this secret work enjoy freedom of movement. A Danish inspector was so indignant that he wanted to resign. Furthermore, the Italian government has not yet responded to Britain's inquiry on the issue of a cessation of the Spanish war. It is expected that no response will be given until Foreign Minister Ciano returns from Chongqing. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas News)

### Spanish Prime Minister Expresses Refusal to Ceasefire

Says Government Forces Will Fight the Enemy and Will Achieve Final Victory

⊙Béziers, France: A local newspaper recently published a speech by Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín to Ramon, a member of the Spanish Academy of Law, stating that the Basque government forces are now bravely fighting the enemy, and their defensive strength is extremely substantial. Therefore, although the port of Bilbao is being besieged by the rebel army, it will definitely be able to hold on and not be captured. "The government forces may now adopt an offensive posture, forcing the rebel army on the Basque front line to withdraw part of their troops to divide their forces, but this is a matter of military secrecy and cannot be disclosed in detail." Referring to the issue of a Spanish ceasefire, he said that there can be no ceasefire as long as the rebel army is not defeated, because only when the government forces achieve victory can the civil war be ended and the hearts of the people throughout the country be pacified. "We now have two important responsibilities: one is to defeat the rebel army, and the other is to restore peace and tranquility in the rear and unite the strength of the rear. In order to make all countries in the world certain that the Republican government is the only legitimate government of Spain, we now hope that the people throughout the country will unanimously support the Republican government, even those who have not joined the cabinet, and all those who share our anti-fascist spirit should do so."

### Four Thousand Basque Refugee Children Arrive in Britain

Shabbily Dressed, Pale Faces

[London] Four thousand children from the Basque Autonomous Region were transported out of the country for refuge by ships belonging to the government forces of the region. They have now arrived outside the port of Southampton, England, and will enter the port tomorrow morning. The town of Stoneham near the port is now actively building temporary shelters to accommodate these children, and a large tent will be erected to serve as a church. (The residents of the Basque Region are all Catholics.) The children will stay in Stoneham for three weeks, and then they will be placed in various places for private individuals or charitable organizations to accommodate them. At this time, the Salvation Army and the British Catholic Church have each agreed to accommodate one thousand children, and several local authorities are also willing to accommodate several children. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas News)

[London] When the mail ship carrying Basque refugee children arrived in Southampton this morning, the children on board were crowded on the deck, leaning forward to wave handkerchiefs to the new British friends waiting on the pier. Among the children, some who could speak English slightly asked the crowd on the shore for oranges and sweets, and asked when they could go ashore. The faces of the children were thin and pale. Most of them were not wearing hats. Their clothes were dirty and shabby, but the colors were quite eye-catching, especially those wearing red clothes. The children were all very lively and mostly carried a paper box containing their treasures. Those from slightly wealthier families carried small suitcases and leather bags. The children must be strictly examined by doctors before being allowed to disembark. It is expected that it will take at least two days to send all of them from the ship to the special camp in Stoneham. The children are currently writing letters to their parents and relatives. When the children left Bilbao two days ago, their relatives waved goodbye with tears. The ship did not have writing paper, so the children mostly used waste paper or the lids of cardboard boxes as letters. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)

⊙Budapest: Local political figures rarely comment on the communiqué issued after the talks between the Italian and Hungarian authorities, and only say that the mutual relations have become more consolidated. The Magyarság newspaper wrote that the communiqué did not mention the issue of Hungary's equal right to armament, because the signatories of the Rome Protocols have stated this view many times, so there is no need to repeat it. However, according to liberal sources, Hungary does not seem to be completely satisfied with the political axis formed by Germany and Italy. Pesti Hírlap wrote, "We should not oppose the policy promoted by the British government. This is true in other countries, but especially important in our country."

⊙Daytona Beach, Florida: Oil King Rockefeller, known as "the richest man in the world," died of heart inflammation today, at the age of ninety-seven, only three years short of his long-held hope of reaching one hundred years old.

### London During the Coronation (Part 1)

Special Correspondent Zheng Nanwei

May 12th is the day of the British King's coronation. These past few days, Britain has been in a state of national frenzy, especially London. Every household is hanging flags and decorations, a grand occasion unprecedented since 1911. The solemn ceremony is traditionally held inside Westminster Abbey, making it difficult for ordinary people to see. However, before and after the new King and Queen enter the Abbey and parade through the streets, everyone gets a good look. Especially after the coronation, the entire procession travels from the bustling downtown area west of the city to Buckingham Palace, a grand parade of about six miles. At that time, the crowned King and Queen sit in the golden royal carriage, radiating majesty. Behind them are a large contingent of royal relatives, foreign envoys, and representatives of various governments specially sent to attend the coronation, all riding in large automobiles, following the parade. Then comes the majestic and awe-inspiring Royal Guard, and the well-organized cavalry, bringing up the rear, adding to the grandeur of the procession. Adding to this are the military bands playing and the cheers of the people, a sea of people, flags flying, shaking the entire city of London.

On that day, all national institutions were closed for celebration, with crowds surging, creating an unprecedented spectacle. Originally, the population of Britain was thirty million, with London accounting for nearly a third. This time, adding at least two million foreigners, everyone was out on the day of the coronation. Just this enormous crowd is an astonishing sight, a magnificent spectacle unmatched by any other city in the world. The price of seats this time was almost double that of 1911, with each ticket selling for 800 yuan, and even the cheapest costing 80 yuan. The total ticket price for seats, boxes, ordinary shop windows, balconies, and rooftop platforms sold along the six-mile route of the procession was over 25.5 million yuan. During the grand ceremony held inside Westminster Abbey, people took turns reporting loudly to the crowds on the street, so that every move inside seemed as if the people outside were witnessing it with their own eyes. There was a telephone exchange in St. James's Palace dedicated to the coronation ceremony. All of these facilities were unprecedented during the coronation of King George V in 1911.

The new King also addressed the 495,764,000 people of the nation and its colonies at 8:00 PM that evening, and the whole world could hear it.

On the day of the coronation, there was another interesting sight: eight magnificent horse-drawn carriages of ancient origin, which 26 years ago carried nobles with four footmen wearing wigs standing behind them, and participated in the coronation parade of the previous King, will reappear in the city of London. They plan to join this year's procession in accordance with ancient rituals, because most people have switched to using cars. These old-fashioned carriages will stand out like cranes among chickens, especially attracting the attention of the crowd.

The coronation decorations throughout the streets will be preserved for two weeks after May 12th, ensuring that they are not damaged by wind, rain, or sunlight. The celebration will be extended for eleven weeks, from May 5th to July 22nd.

Their preparations for this coronation ceremony are so intense and burdensome that it is like preparing for a major war. On the day of the coronation, the entire nation (except for the Irish Free State) will be decorated brilliantly, in a variety of ways. The main colors, of course, are red, white, and blue, the colors of the flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, but they can be used in various forms, even on the keyboard of a piano. Villagers even paint the cows with these three colors. One fish farmer promised to find a goldfish with these three colors to offer as tribute. There are also coronation eggs with yolks of these three colors. Every street and village is thinking of ways to satisfy their desire for these colors.

The colors representing Britain will be displayed in the most magnificent place, of course, in Westminster Abbey. The royal colors there, such as purple, the gold of the brocade cabinets, the blue on the badges, and the crimson worn by the nobles, are all officially prescribed colors, which can be mixed with the three colors of the national flag for decoration.

The Emperor's regalia is also ready. The King will wear two crowns during the coronation. One is the Crown of St. Edward, passed down and forever unchanging, and the other is the so-called British Imperial State Crown. Each time, according to the new King's head size, one-eighth or one-quarter of an inch is removed from the white silk lining for imperial use. For the Queen, however, each time a crown is made temporarily, inlaid with the world-famous large diamond presented to Queen Victoria by the East India Company in 1851, and which has since become a national treasure. This year, however, the Queen's crown is made of platinum, which no previous queen has worn.

Westminster Abbey has been closed since January of this year, specifically for renovation and decoration in preparation for this grand ceremony. The interior is full of workers, busy even now. Originally, it could only accommodate 2,000 people, but this renovation will allow for about 7,700 people. Many tombstones have been removed, so the corners and corridors have been arranged with seats, so there is not an inch of empty space. (Sent from London on May 1st)

### "Eastern Hebei" is Dark and Hopeless, Counterfeit Money is Rampant, and Oppressive Taxes are Innumerable

Coal and Iron Treasures are Sold Off, and a Fake Gold Mining Bureau has been Established

Tianjin Correspondence: The rumor that the "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization is about to be abolished has recently been rife, causing great panic among the "Eastern Hebei" gang of villains. The staff of the puppet agencies all have the mentality of "living for the day." The area around Tangshan and Yu County is restless. Yin Rugeng is intensifying his efforts to appease foreign powers on the one hand and using violence to oppress the people of "Eastern Hebei" on the other. Moreover, due to extreme financial hardship, oppressive taxes are numerous, making life dark and hopeless, and the people cannot survive. The people of "Eastern Hebei" hope that the government will use force to expel the rebels, so that they can see the light of day again, like looking forward to rain in a great drought. The recent situation in "Eastern Hebei" is briefly described below.

The Two Rebels, Yin and Chi, Have Deep-Seated Hatred for Each Other

Yin Rugeng and Chi Zongmo, the Secretary-General of the "Eastern Hebei" puppet government, are both seen as important by a certain party. One is supported by a certain military department in Guanwai (Manchuria), and the other is supported by a certain military department in Guannei (China proper). On the surface, Yin Rugeng is the head of the puppet government, and Chi Zongmo is the Secretary-General, resembling a superior and subordinate. In reality, their positions are equal, and their forces are evenly matched. After the establishment of the puppet government, Yin Rugeng placed his own people in key positions. The first instance was the position of Director of the Tangshan Office, occupied by Yin Tixin (the current Director of the puppet Industry Department), which incurred the dissatisfaction of Chi Zongmo. Later, the power over finance and transportation was entirely entrusted to Yin Rugeng's confidants, and Chi Zongmo's intention to overthrow Yin arose. Chi once conspired with two staff officers of a certain military department in Guannei in Tianjin to overthrow Yin, with the aim of taking Yin's position and replacing him. Yin Rugeng also traveled between Tianjin and Changchun in April, hoping to seek assistance from the Chief of Staff of a certain military department in Guanwai. Recently, due to the widespread rumor that the "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization is about to be abolished, Yin and Chi had no choice but to temporarily suppress their private disputes on the surface in order to run around and seek survival. Yin Rugeng previously sent Chi Zongmo to Japan to engage in activities and also bribed some undeserved groups from a certain party to advocate for him. Although Chi Zongmo has now returned to China and returned to Tongzhou, the deep-seated hatred between the two rebels still cannot be resolved.

Extreme Financial Deficit and Ruthless Taxes

The "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization's annual expenditure requires about 8 million yuan, with the smuggling taxes collected by the puppet customs offices in Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe accounting for the bulk of the revenue. Recently, due to the strictness of the anti-smuggling organization in North China, smuggling income has sharply decreased. Among the expenditure items, the activity expenses written off to extend the life of the puppet organization have reached 1 million yuan annually. In order to strengthen his forces, Yin Rugeng also increased the puppet Security Supplementary Corps, whose expenses amount to 300,000 yuan per month. With reduced income and increased expenditure, he felt increasingly strapped for cash. Therefore, he came up with a clever way to save himself from poverty: establishing the puppet "Eastern Hebei" Bank and issuing unlimited amount of inconvertible counterfeit banknotes, forcing people to use them. Now, the salaries of all officials, large and small, in the puppet agencies are paid with a mix of 30% legal tender and 70% counterfeit currency. At the same time, he also set up many kinds of exorbitant taxes, using all possible means to seize wealth by any means. The puppet "Eastern Hebei" Bank has recently established branches in all 22 counties of "Eastern Hebei" to promote the counterfeit currency. Because the counterfeit currency cannot be exchanged anywhere, people are mostly unwilling to use it. However, Yin Rugeng issued an order that those who refuse to use the counterfeit currency will be punished for disrupting the financial order. A Yiyuantang pharmacy in Tong County, the location of the puppet government, was sealed up by Yin Rugeng a few days ago for refusing to use counterfeit currency. The owner, surnamed Mou, is still imprisoned and has not been released. This is a common occurrence in the darkness of "Eastern Hebei". For example, in Hetou Town, Fengrun County, there are 80,000 residents engaged in the pig bristle industry. Recently, due to the addition of three kinds of exorbitant taxes, they are unable to operate, and they have all ceased business. Some families have committed suicide due to lack of livelihood. Such human tragedies exist.

Establishing a Gold Mining Bureau to Sell Off Mineral Deposits

The "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization, following the suggestion of Zhang Hu, the former Minister of Finance of the Beijing government, organized a Gold Mining Bureau, which was established on April 13th at No. 11 Kuixinglou, Tong County. Yin Rugeng himself serves as the Director-General, Chi Zongmo as the Director-General, and Yin Tixin, Director of the puppet Industry Department, as the Assistant Director-General. Zhang Hu serves as the Chairman, and Zhang's second son, Zhang Tongliang, serves as the Technical Director, controlling the mining of gold mines within the puppet territory, the transportation and sale of gold produced, and the issuance of mining licenses. All mining licenses originally issued by the Ministry of Industry of the National Government and the Hebei Provincial Government are invalidated. The gold mines in Xinglong and other counties within the puppet area are completely opened by Yin Rugeng for the puppet Manchukuo Gold Mining Company, which is controlled by a certain party, with 30% of the net profit going to "Eastern Hebei" and 70% going to the puppet Manchukuo Gold Mining Company, to curry favor with that party. This treasure has already been started for mining. In order to show his loyalty to a certain party, Yin Rugeng has also opened up all the coal and iron ore deposits in "Eastern Hebei" to welcome investment and mining by that party and is dredging the Daqing River estuary to facilitate the export of mineral products, metals, coal, iron, and other mineral resources. That party is quite appreciative of Yin Rugeng's obedience. However, even if the puppet organization is abolished, that party's special influence in "Eastern Hebei" will inevitably remain closely intertwined. Yin Rugeng's harm to the country is truly infuriating. (21st)

### Song and Han Meet in Shanghe

Jinan Correspondence: Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, returned to his hometown of Leling on the 11th of this month to sweep the tombs of his ancestors. At that time, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, was inspecting Jiaodong, so he returned to Jinan immediately and sent Wen Chenglie, a senior advisor to the Provincial Government, to Leling to invite Song to meet in Jinan. Han and Song were comrades-in-arms in the Northwest Army for many years, and now they both bear heavy responsibilities in North China, so a meeting was necessary for both public and private reasons. However, Song was unable to come to Jinan because he was repairing the tombs in his hometown, so Han then invited Song to meet in Shanghe, because Shanghe is located between Jinan and Leling, which is a more suitable location. However, because the Minister of Interior, Jiang Zuobin, happened to come to Shandong for inspection at this time, they could not proceed until the morning of the 21st. That morning at 5:30, Han left the Provincial Government by car, accompanied by Wen Chenglie, Ge Jinzhang, Deng Zhexian, President of the Hebei High Court, and Li Xin, Director of the Provincial Police Department, traveling in two cars, with another car carrying guards. They crossed the Yellow River north from Luokou and arrived at Maojia Temple, 30 miles southwest of Shanghe City, at 9:30. Song was already waiting in the village, so they went together into a small shop to rest and have lunch. Because the village was holding a local opera performance, after lunch, Han, Song, and others went to watch the opera. The masses were spectators, as they caught sight of these two Provincial Governors, Song donated 50 yuan, and Han donated 100 yuan. Then they returned to the shop and talked freely about everything. At 4:00 in the afternoon, Han and his party sent Song off first to return to Leling, and then drove south to return to Jinan. At 4:30, they arrived at Xiaokou Town in the territory of Linyi and rested for a meal. At 6:00, they returned to Jinan. According to Han, "I am an old friend of Chairman Song, and we have not met for a long time. As he asked for leave to return to his hometown, I went to meet and talk with him. There was no other task. Chairman Song will probably stay in his hometown for a few more days." (21st)

### Recent Total Exports of Anhui Rice

Imports of Foreign Rice to Guangdong Have Stalled, while Miscellaneous Grains from Southern Anhui Appear, Cracking Down on Mixing with Ash and Soil

Wuhu Correspondence: The Wuhu rice market has seen its sales to Guangdong almost completely stalled in the past two months due to the large-scale import of foreign rice. However, in recent days, as Sichuan Pingyao Bureau purchasers bought and transported rice, Chaozhou transporters have collected, and the market has slightly improved, with an average of about 3,000 to 4,000 bags exported daily. The average price is 8.23 yuan for medium machine rice and 7.34 yuan for brown rice. Statistics show that since February of this year, the total amount of rice exported from Wuhu has been 29,369 bags to Yantai, 23,857 bags to Haicanwei, 5,637 bags to Shanghai Longkou, 8,197 bags to Qingdao, 100,975 bags to Tianjin, 97,859 bags to Guangzhou, and 180,220 bags to Chaozhou and Shantou, for a total of 454,844 bags. In addition, the export of various miscellaneous grains has also reached more than 100,000 piculs. As spring ends and summer arrives, oilseeds and wheat from southern Anhui have begun to appear on the market one after another, with hundreds of piculs arriving in Wuhu every day. However, the harvest has been reduced by 60-70% compared to last year, so the selling price is also more expensive. The grain transporting industry and the miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry in this area export a large amount of wheat, rapeseed, and other products produced in various counties of Anhui Province to foreign countries every year, and Wuhu is a distribution center for grain. However, in the past, farmers in various counties have always resorted to fraud when new goods are released, not only failing to dry them in the sun but also privately mixing ash and soil into them to increase the weight. If this continues, it will be difficult to avoid a gradual decline in the external sales status. As new goods are launched, I am sincerely afraid that the old tricks will re-emerge. Therefore, I specially submitted a report to the Wuhu and Xuancheng Administrative Commissioner's Offices, ordering the governments of various counties in southern Anhui to issue strict prohibitions and instruct all Baojia chiefs to supervise at all times and vigorously crack down on them so that the future of production and sales will not be harmed.

### Wuxi

Actively Expanding Streets and Demolishing Walls

The Wuxi County Construction Committee is actively expanding North Avenue and demolishing North Yuecheng. It has been decided that the width of the road surface will be 8 meters as the standard, to be carried out in two phases. The first phase, from Lianrong Bridge to North Suspension Bridge and from inside the North Gate to Cang Bridge, is scheduled to begin on June 20th and be completed by the end of September. The second phase is scheduled to begin on February 10th next year and be completed by the end of May. However, the merchants inside and outside the North Gate Yuecheng have jointly submitted a petition to the Construction Committee, requesting that the start date of the first phase of demolishing North Yuecheng be postponed to the start of the second phase, so that they can sell their inventory within the time limit and seek to close down.

New Bride's Physiological Abnormality

Hu Shouji, a 21-year-old resident of Changqiao in this county, recently married the second daughter of Li Changchu, manager of a certain transportation company in this city, through the matchmaking of Miao Dongchen, chairman of the Nanhua industry. The wedding took place last month, but on the day after the auspicious occasion, the groom had a worried look on his face. After being questioned, he finally revealed that when the groom was in the same room as the bride, the groom's lower body felt like it was being pricked by thorns, cut by a knife, or stung by a snake, causing unbearable pain. This happened repeatedly. The bride was completely different from ordinary women. The groom's parents then raised the issue with the bride's family. After both parents and the matchmaker accompanied them to the hospital for an examination, it was indeed found that the bride's lower body had something inside that looked like scales or barbs, firm and sharp, which was a rare physiological abnormality. She was indeed incapable of human interaction and could not bear children. The bride has now decided to remain single and will re-enter school to study in order to seek self-reliance. The groom is depressed. Recently, someone suggested marrying the bride's sister to the groom in order to make up for the deficiencies in both families, but the sister refused, so the marriage problem has not been resolved.

### Changshu

Rushing to Build Main Roads Inside and Outside the City

Traffic from the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou-Changzhou roads is concentrated at the South Gate, but traffic inside the city and on mountain roads is inconvenient. The County Government has rebuilt the South Gate and completely widened the old street between the South Gate and the North Gate, a distance of 2.5 kilometers, to 10 meters. Construction has been underway for a long time, and the North Gate section has been completed. The entire road will be completed in another two months. The Huanshan North Road from the North Gate to Yushan has been built by the engineering corps of the 87th Division of the garrison into an 8-meter-wide roadbed, paved with a 3-meter-wide macadam surface, which has now been completed. Pedestrians praise its usefulness. The Huanshan South Road outside the West Gate was also started yesterday by the garrison. Division Commander Wang Jingjiu has set a deadline of two weeks for completion. From then on, mountain tourists can easily reach their destinations by car or horse.

### Zhenjiang

Selecting Land to Move Beggars and Reclaim Wasteland

In order to tidy up the city and maintain public order, the provincial authorities previously searched the entire city for beggars and established a beggar shelter outside the South Gate, run by the Provincial Relief Institute. Although the number of beggars lingering in the city has been greatly reduced, they have not been completely eliminated. The Relief Institute has separately instructed the beggar search teams to search again and also instructed all merchants and residents to report any beggars who come to their doors. It is now known that the institute has formulated a method of relocating and reclaiming wasteland for the captured beggars, selecting several wasteland locations in the suburbs of the provincial capital as reclamation sites. The plan is currently being drafted and will be submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval in the coming days before implementation begins.

Opening Bids for Remaining Land at Dakoumen

The Zhenjiang Port Land Consolidation Committee announced the auction of the remaining land at Dakoumen, which was opened on the 21st at the Provincial Land Administration Bureau. Representatives from the Provincial Government and various departments and offices were present to supervise. As a result, the bid prices of the winning bidders were more than double the original bid, showing the intensity of the competition. In addition to numbers 95 and 99, which still need to be consulted with the priority rights holders in accordance with the regulations to determine whether they are willing to purchase, the other winning bidders have been notified by the committee to pay 10% of the land price within two days as a purchase deposit. The remaining balance must be paid within ten days, or else the next highest bidder will be successively eligible to purchase.

In addition to employing doctors of various specialties to examine the health of insured individuals, insurance organizations regularly promote physical exercise, impart basic healthcare knowledge, improve nutritional methods, and frequently hold health lectures and screen health-related films, among other proactive initiatives. This type of labor insurance system originated in Germany during the era of Bismarck's social policies. In recent times, many countries have implemented similar systems, with types evolving over time. Not only do workers benefit significantly, but it also has a profound impact on the physical health of the nation. Japan currently only has health insurance; other types of labor insurance are not yet widespread.

Employer Attitudes

Japanese financial capitalism is quite developed. Major political parties, such as the Seiyukai and Minseito, have financial capitalists as their pillars. The enterprises themselves have organizations such as the Japan Industrial Association and the National Federation, whose purpose is to protect Japanese enterprises and gain a superior social and political position, oppose class struggle, and, within the realm of possibility, use legislative means to elevate the status and improve the lives of workers. Their protection of small business owners is even more comprehensive. For example, the Association believed that small business owners could not afford the cost of the government's mandatory enterprise fund establishment law passed last year, which was intended to prepare for the payment of severance allowances to workers upon leaving their jobs, and requested the government to amend it.

Japanese enterprises are developing rapidly, as can be seen from the annual factory statistics. For example, there were only 64,435 in 1931, increasing to 67,318 in 1932, 71,940 in 1933, and 80,311 in 1934. The number of factories has been increasing year by year. Although statistics for 1935 and 1936 are not yet available, their progress can be predicted.

Labor Dispute Situation

1931 was the period with the most labor disputes in Japan. However, after the Manchurian Incident occurred, general thinking changed. Moreover, the country vigorously strengthened its military, resulting in the extreme development of military industries and heavy industries. As a result, the number of unemployed workers gradually decreased, and labor disputes also gradually decreased.

Looking at the statistics for 1935, the most common cause of labor disputes was wage increases, accounting for 25.9 percent. The next most common was disputes over severance pay, accounting for 15 percent, followed by opposition to layoffs, accounting for 14.5 percent. Osaka was the most frequent location for labor disputes, followed by Tokyo. In general, after labor disputes occurred, either the Social Affairs Bureau would mediate, or labor and management would negotiate and reach an agreement on their own. However, most disputes were resolved through the latter method. A glimpse of the general situation can be seen from the labor disputes in September 1935. There were a total of 467 labor disputes, with 30,781 participants. Of these, 114 were won by the workers, 130 were lost, and 223 were settled through compromise.

Relationship with International Labor

Although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it has not withdrawn from the International Labour Conference and remains a member state. Each time the International Labour Conference is held, the candidates for its representatives are recommended by the Japan Federation of Labour Unions, and then commissioned by the government. They are fully prepared before attending, and the delegation has many consultants and secretaries. In the international arena, it can be called a perfectly organized labor delegation.

In addition to its relationship with the International Labour Conference, the Japanese labor group, its maritime workers' group, has recently joined the International Transport Workers' Federation. This organization has considerable influence in international labor. It is headed by the Dutch labor leader Edo Fimmen. Last year, Zhao Banfu, a representative of Chinese seafarers, attended the 21st and 22nd Maritime Conferences. This conference was controlled by the International Transport Workers' Federation, so transportation worker groups such as seafarers, dockworkers, and railways in Europe and the United States have relationships with it.

Conclusion

The labor movement and the development of the capitalist system are mutually causal. Strictly speaking, the Japanese labor movement has only been around for two or three decades. However, workers have a deep understanding of their own position. The number of workers with statistics and organizations is close to 10 percent of the national total. They have gained the right to participate in labor legislation and social facilities. Looking back at China's labor movement, it began with the May Fourth Movement and went through the May 30th Movement and the Northern Expedition Revolution. Under the leadership of our party, although it has achieved some results, it is still in a very naive stage in terms of organization and self-understanding. As a result, the welfare of the workers themselves and their social status are very weak. The underdevelopment of China's social economy, backward industrial production, and the lack of social importance attached to the value of labor, as well as the lack of universal labor education, are the main reasons for the naivety of the labor movement. Therefore, if we want to develop China's labor movement, on the one hand, we must seek the development of the national economy, and on the other hand, we must improve the status of workers, give them educational opportunities, so that capital and labor are equally important, use coordinated methods, seek the development of industry, and improve the treatment of workers. Those of us who lead the workers' movement should especially recognize the importance of our own responsibilities, embrace the spirit of sacrifice and hard work, and step up labor training and organization. China has a large number of workers. If we can lay its foundation and enlighten and educate it, not only will the workers themselves benefit a great deal, but it will also be greatly related to the future revival of the country and the nation. I sincerely hope that the people of the country and all advanced workers will pay attention to this, which is what I am very happy about. (The End)

### The Sino-French Flight Fails in Siam After Completing Over Ten Thousand Kilometers

After recovering from his injuries, he flew from Hanoi to Guangzhou yesterday and arrived in Shanghai. He is scheduled to go to Beijing tonight to report the details to the authorities.

Hu Zhiyuan, a Chinese student studying aviation in France.

Mr. Hu Zhiyuan, a young Chinese student who studied aviation in France, set off from Paris, France on April 29 of this year to undertake the audacious long-distance flight between Paris and Nanjing, crossing Europe and Asia. Initially, everything went smoothly. By the 13th of this month, he had flown to Siam, completing nine-tenths of the entire Sino-French flight. However, on the same day, while flying to a point 100 kilometers away from Annam, he was forced to land in a paddy field due to a sudden change in weather. Both the person and the aircraft were injured, thwarting his ambition. However, Mr. Hu's solo Sino-French international flight, completing a long-distance flight of over 12,000 kilometers, is already a rare record for the Chinese people. After recovering from his injuries in Siam, Mr. Hu transferred from Siam to Hanoi and took a Southwest Aviation Company plane to Guangzhou. Yesterday, he took a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Guangzhou to Shanghai. He is scheduled to go to Beijing tonight to report the details to the Aviation Commission. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency specially interviewed Mr. Hu at the airport yesterday, and he provided a detailed account of the flight back to China and the accident that occurred en route, as follows:

Audacious Sino-French Long-Distance Flight

Hu Zhiyuan is from Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province. He went to France in 1930 to study mechanical engineering and returned to China two years later. After returning to China, Mr. Hu, in view of the urgent need to develop China's aviation industry, went to France again in 1934 to specialize in aviation mechanics and piloting. In August of the same year, he successively entered the French Caudron Aviation School, the French Civil Aviation Department Aviation School, and the French Aviation Mechanical Specialized School to study aviation mechanics and elementary flying. By August of last year, he had completed advanced flying at the Mulang Fama and other aviation schools. In October of the same year, he crossed over to Italy and specialized in aircraft engine studies at the Fiat aircraft factory in Italy. In January of this year, he returned to France from Italy. After completing advanced experimental flying in France again, he planned to undertake a long-distance flight between Paris and Nanjing. After the French Embassy and other organizations assisted in handling flight overflight passports for various countries, and after reporting by telegram to the Aviation Commission of our country and obtaining a Sino-French flight license, he departed from the Paris airport on the 29th of last month, flying a single-wing aircraft alone (the aircraft body trademark is Coudron, the engine trademark is Renault, 100 horsepower, and the identification number is Fapc) to fly back to his motherland.

Travelled More Than 10,000 Kilometers

Mr. Hu departed at 10:00 AM on the 29th and flew to Pisa, Italy that afternoon. He spent the night in Pisa. On the morning of the 30th, he continued to depart and flew more than 1,200 kilometers, flying over Rome to Naples. On the 2nd of this month, he flew across the Mediterranean Sea to French Gabes. On the 3rd, he continued to advance to Italian Bangbasi. On that day, he flew over Cairo, Egypt, and British Palestine, reaching French Syria. On the 5th, he arrived in Earg, Iraq. On the 6th, he arrived in Syesk. On the 7th, he arrived in Juphor, India. On the 8th, he arrived in Calcutta. On the 9th, he flew to Akyab, Burma. When Mr. Hu arrived at that place, he suffered from diarrhea and stayed in Futi for three days. On the 11th, he continued to fly to Rangoon. At the same time, he departed from Rangoon, intending to complete the journey to Siam on the same day. According to the Sino-French Paris-Nanjing itinerary, the total distance is 14,000 kilometers. When he arrived in Rangoon, he had completed nine-tenths of the journey, about 12,000 kilometers. Only more than 2,000 kilometers remained from Siam to Nanjing.

Encountered Danger En Route, Both Person and Aircraft Were Injured

On the 13th of this month, when Mr. Hu flew from Rangoon to Siam, his scheduled landing point in Siam was the Laotian region, only 700 kilometers from Rangoon. Therefore, when Mr. Hu departed, he carried enough gasoline to fly 800 kilometers, which he predicted would be sufficient. However, he unexpectedly encountered several thunderstorms en route. Because the horsepower of Mr. Hu's aircraft was very small, in order to avoid danger, he temporarily flew in an arc to avoid the huge wind attacks. As a result, the journey increased invisibly. When he flew to the Kampong Thom area in Siam, less than 100 kilometers from Laos, he discovered that the gasoline was exhausted, so he had no choice but to make a forced landing. The landing place happened to be a paddy field, causing the aircraft wheels to sink deeply into the mud and the engine to hit the field ridge, causing damage to the aircraft body and wings. Mr. Hu's head and legs were also injured due to excessive vibration. After the accident, he was rescued by the local government and treated at the private residence of the Kampong Thom Mayor, Prabsatron. Fortunately, the injuries were still minor. After the doctor bandaged him and he rested for two days, he recovered. However, although the engine and other parts of the aircraft were not damaged, the wings and other equipment were destroyed and could no longer fly. As a result, this audacious Sino-French long-distance flight was frustrated and unable to achieve its ambition. According to Mr. Hu, the area near Kampong Thom in Siam is one of the most climatically harsh sections of the entire line. In the past, the French aviator Daumesnil also encountered an accident near this place when he was flying from Paris to Tokyo. He could have detoured this time, but in order to shorten the journey, he still flew along the original route. Unfortunately, he encountered this obstacle and deeply regretted it.

Transferred from Siam to Guangzhou, Flew to Shanghai Yesterday

After Mr. Hu recovered from his injuries in Kampong Thom, he took a plane to Laos, transferred from Laos to Hanoi, and arrived in Guangzhou on a Southwest Airlines plane the day before yesterday. He then took a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Guangzhou to Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday. He arrived at Longhua Airport at 2:30 PM in the afternoon. As for the destroyed aircraft, it is currently still stranded in Kampong Thom. Mr. Hu has entrusted the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Siam and our country's consul in Siam to find a way to dismantle it and transport the engine and parts back to the motherland. After Mr. Hu arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he temporarily stayed in a hotel. He is scheduled to take a train to Beijing tonight to report the details to the authorities. According to Mr. Hu's Shenzhou News Agency reporter yesterday, although he completed nine-tenths of the journey from France back to his motherland, he ultimately failed to achieve complete success, and he personally felt ashamed. If there is an opportunity and the environment allows it in the future, he would like to make a few more attempts. Our country's aviation industry is still in the initial stage of development, and I deeply hope that the people of the country will jointly seek its expansion. I am willing to engage in aviation propaganda work after returning to the country this time, in order to arouse the people of the country's attention to the air transportation industry.

### Records of Contemporary Figures' Whereabouts

Chen Gongbo, Minister of the Central Training Department; Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan; Fu Bingchang, Legislator; Peng Xuepei, Vice Minister of Communications; and Fu Rulin, Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, jointly took the night train from Beijing to Shanghai at 11:00 PM the night before last and arrived here at around 7:00 AM yesterday (the 23rd).

Shao Lizi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, took the night train from Beijing to Shanghai at 11:00 PM the night before last (the 22nd) and arrived at the North Station at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He went directly to the Cangzhou Hotel to rest. Mr. Shao came here to attend the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Film Production Industry Association and deliver a speech. He took the night train back to Beijing last night. Zeng Yangfu, Mayor of Guangzhou City and Acting Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance, recently went to Beijing to have some contacts with the central government. He completed his official business and took the night train from Beijing to Shanghai at 11:00 PM the night before last and arrived here at around 7:00 AM yesterday (the 23rd). It is not yet determined when Mr. Zeng will return to the south.

Zha Jixiang, Director of the Naval Administration Department of the Ministry of the Navy, came to Shanghai from Beijing on the 22nd and is scheduled to return to Beijing on Tuesday.

### Xu Shiying's Illness Has Recovered

Mr. Xu Shiying, our country's ambassador to Japan, was previously staying in Shanghai for medical treatment due to illness. It has been almost a month. According to Mr. Xu's Shanghai residence yesterday, Mr. Xu's ear disease has now recovered. However, due to old age and physical weakness, he feels quite tired after this illness. He has decided to go to the suburbs for recuperation in the next few days. Once his body has fully recovered, he will go to Huangshan to inspect the construction. The date of his return to office will be extended.

### Japanese Envoys' Itinerary

Kawagoe is scheduled to come to China early next month. Morishima left Shanghai by plane for Tianjin this morning.

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, according to news from the Japanese Consul, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigeru Kawagoe, has dispelled his intention to resign and has decided to return to China to resume his post early next month. However, the exact date of departure has not yet been determined. Morishima Morito, the new counselor of the Japanese Embassy, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, went to Beijing once, and then returned to Shanghai with Hidak Shinrokuro, the counselor and consul general stationed in Beijing, and Okamoto Sueji, the counselor and consul general stationed in Shanghai, and Miura, the consul general stationed in Hankou, was also summoned to Shanghai to hold a meeting to discuss everything. He left Shanghai for Tianjin by Eurasia Aviation Company plane at 6:30 this morning to meet with Horiuchi, the consul general stationed in Tianjin, and then transferred to Peiping to take up his duties. It is said that Tokyo sent a telegram to Morishima, scheduling his return to China on the 25th. This is probably not a confirmation, as Morishima had just arrived in China and had not yet taken office in Peiping for a month. Also, Hidak's mission to Shanghai has been completed, and he is scheduled to return to Beijing today.

### After the Price of Spring Cocoons Soars, Manufacturers Temporarily Suspend the Sale of Futures

The price of raw silk for users has also risen accordingly. Shanghai silk factories have decided to switch to a production volume system.

After the spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were put on the market, the harvest in Zhejiang Province was reduced due to uneven rainfall. Each cocoon house competed to buy them, driving up the price. Each silk manufacturer has temporarily suspended selling silk. Each factory in Shanghai is preparing to start work and has decided to try out the production volume system. The following is a record of the opinions of the crowd.

Spring Cocoons Have a Poor Harvest and Prices Soar

Due to uneven rainfall in various parts of Zhejiang Province, the spring cocoons have had a poor harvest, especially the local varieties. Due to the reduced production, it is difficult for each cocoon house to collect enough, and they are raising prices and competing to buy them. The standard price for local varieties is 27 yuan per dan of fresh cocoons, but it has now risen to 22 yuan. Improved varieties in Jiaxing and other places have begun to be put on the market. Although the harvest is better than that of local varieties, it is not as good as last year. Its price also exceeds the standard figure of more than 37 yuan per dan of fresh cocoons.

Each Silk Manufacturer Has Temporarily Suspended Selling

Each silk factory in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi usually sells silk to various foreign firms engaged in export and domestic user silk factories when the spring cocoons are about to be put on the market. According to the sales contract, the goods are to be delivered in installments. Now, due to the poor harvest of spring cocoons and soaring prices, in order to avoid losses, the sales have been temporarily suspended. The previously sold price of 20 to 22 denier B-grade is about 720 to 30 yuan per dan. Currently, domestic users have increased to 750 to 60 yuan, but each manufacturer is unwilling to sell. The foreign market price (is roughly the same as before).

Shanghai Silk Factories Switch to a Production Volume System

The spring cocoons that each silk manufacturer in Shanghai has collected from Shaoxing, Yuhang, Haining, and other places in Zhejiang Province have begun to be loaded onto trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and transported to Shanghai. When they arrive, they will immediately start reeling silk. The wages of workers in each factory used to be calculated on a daily basis. For example, the first-class wage was 50 cents per day. Now it has been decided to change to a production volume system, with the amount of work produced by the workers as the standard for calculating wages. However, the production volume system was tried out by each factory the year before last, but it was suspended due to worker opposition.

### Film Production Industry Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

Central Propaganda Minister Shao Lizi Personally Attended to Give Instructions; Wu Bangfan and Others Elected as Executive Committee Members

The Shanghai Film Production Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday in the North Hall of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association. Central Propaganda Minister Shao Lizi, Zhang Daofan of the Central Film Censorship Committee (represented by Luo Gang), Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Changchun, representative of the Municipal Government, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, guests from all walks of life Lin Kanghou, Luo Qinghua, Chen Kecheng, Chen Xunyu, and representatives and employees from various film production companies, totaling hundreds of people, attended. Banners, couplets, and silver shields presented by various sectors filled the venue, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. Details are recorded as follows:

Chairman's Report

The presidium, consisting of Shao Zuiweng, Yan Chuntang, Tao Bosun, Wu Bangfan, Zhang Shankun, and Zhou Jianyun, led the attendees in performing the customary rituals. Tao Bosun delivered the opening address, stating that he was deeply grateful for the presence of Minister Shao and representatives from the Party and government authorities, as well as guests from all walks of life, at the association's inaugural meeting. Colleagues in the industry felt the lack of communication in the past. The establishment of this association aims to unite everyone and, under the leadership of the Party and government authorities, promote the development of domestic films. The colleagues also deeply understand the significant responsibilities borne by those engaged in the film industry. In the future, they will move forward with a spirit of collective effort and wisdom. They also hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance to make up for any shortcomings.

Preparation Process

Zhang Shankun then reported on the preparation process, stating that Chinese-operated film businesses have a history of more than twenty years. During these twenty years, they have faced numerous difficulties, but colleagues have struggled and strived, never giving up. In the past, foreign films dominated the domestic market, causing a massive outflow of domestic funds and having a significant impact on the thinking of the Chinese people. Therefore, colleagues felt the need to unite, openly research, and work together. Hence, the initiative to organize an industry association. In recent months, the preparatory work has become more active. Today marks the official establishment. However, today is not a day for rejoicing but a day for starting hard work because domestic films are still in a difficult environment. Therefore, they must work together to advance the industry.

Minister Shao's Speech

Next, Central Propaganda Minister Shao Lizi delivered instructions, saying that he was present to sincerely congratulate the establishment of the association. The spirit of hard work and struggle in the domestic film industry in the past, combined with the unity shown today, guarantees a bright future. The film industry has significant importance in culture and social education. The national rejuvenation movement, which China is currently striving for, occupies an extremely important position in the film industry. Today, the film industry colleagues recognize this point and are seeking unity, so he congratulates them on their unlimited future. However, unity requires "essence" and "sincerity". "Essence" refers to the essence of the spirit, and it can also refer to the essence of striving for perfection. The first key to unity is self-improvement. To create a perfect film, you must not only have a good script and a good director but also ensure that every film worker has good abilities and a full spirit to produce a good film. General employees are like elite soldiers in the army, with full combat power. It is necessary to make every employee recognize the responsibilities of the film industry in culture, social education, and the national rejuvenation movement, and be able to fight fully for all the above-mentioned relations. A group formed in this way can be healthy. "Sincerity" means not only being sincere to yourself but also being sincere to others. If everyone only cares about themselves, ignores the interests of others, and disregards common interests, it will inevitably lead to disunity. Therefore, the word "sincerity" is more important. In the past, the Chinese film industry struggled in hardship and bitterness for more than twenty years. Today, everyone has this awareness and is seeking to test the unity, so the future is, of course, full of hope. He also thought of a story, that when the Shanghai film industry was in Beijing, they invited him and others to a banquet. During the banquet, he raised the issue of the "Sai Jinhua" drama for discussion, as to whether it could be released to the public. Apart from pleading with him during the Gengzi Incident in the late Qing Dynasty, so that residents in the Tianjin area could reduce their suffering, Sai Jinhua had nothing worth praising. However, the present era is very different from the late Qing Dynasty. If China encounters foreign invasion again today, it would rather be shattered than surrender and would never beg for mercy from foreigners. Therefore, this kind of script is not only unworthy of publicity, but the Central Government believes that it is necessary to ban it. Mr. Xiong Foxi, who initially wrote this script, intended to modify it. However, after his detailed explanation, Mr. Xiong disregarded all sacrifices and voluntarily withdrew this script. He greatly admired this spirit of disregarding personal interests, respecting the interests of the entire nation, and obeying government orders. Therefore, he hopes that the film industry will consider national interests and follow Mr. Xiong's spirit. He congratulates the association on its unlimited future.

Speeches by Guo and Zhang

Next, Guo Youshou, representative of the China Film Education Association, delivered a speech, saying that film and education are inseparable. Mr. Monroe proposed an opinion during a lecture in Beijing, believing that films should fully contain the meaning of education, so that the general public also has the opportunity to appreciate education during leisure time. He hopes that the film industry can pay special attention to this point. Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Film Censorship Committee, delivered a speech on behalf of Luo Gang, saying that the film industry has struggled for twenty years. Today, with the establishment of the association, they should strive for unity. Now that the form is in place, they should pay more attention to spiritual efforts. So-called "internal stability and external resistance", with internal unity, domestic films will inevitably be able to compete with foreign films. Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a speech, saying that the association is also a kind of trade association, but different from other trade associations, it should strive for the interests of the society and the country while seeking the interests of the industry itself. Wang Changchun, representative of the Municipal Government, delivered a speech, saying: (1) Cooperate fully to make all cinema buildings popular and spread to rural areas. (2) Spoken dramas should develop first, and then the film industry can follow. Therefore, in the effort in the film industry, we must take spoken dramas as the vanguard. (3) Film materials should pay special attention to China's inherent virtues. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, delivered a speech, saying: (1) The film industry controls the authority of propaganda. No matter what kind of propaganda, nothing is more effective than the film industry. (2) The film industry is a tool for education. Films include both visual and auditory senses, combined into one, and can shorten or extend time and space according to actual needs. Because of its huge effect, it should be promoted.

Speeches by Guests

Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, delivered a speech, saying that in the past, the general mentality of Chinese people was to enjoy watching foreign movies. In the future, we should strive to break this mentality. Although he is a layman, he hopes that the government authorities will give support and guidance and provide various conveniences. At the same time, film stars and actors should be trained, and strive for cooperation with each other, so there can be a bright future. Luo Qinghua, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech, saying that all emerging industries in China generally go through the following three stages: (1) Being threatened by international capitalism, (2) Competing with each other, (3) Joint operations. Now the industry has reached the third stage, and there will be great hope for the future. Moreover, the importance of the industry is incomparable to other industries. Now that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has one more new force, he, on behalf of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, of course, expresses great joy.

Election of Executive and Supervisory Committee Members

After the representatives from all walks of life delivered their speeches, Zhou Jianyun delivered a thank-you speech. Then the charter was passed and Shao Zuiweng, Jin Jingyu, and Ren Jinpin were appointed to draft a declaration. Then, the election began. As a result, Wu Bangfan, Zhang Shichuan, Zhang Shankun, Shao Zuiweng, Zhang Bingsheng, Yan Youxiang, Jin Jingyu, Yan Chuntang, Zhou Jianyun, Luo Mingyou, Tao Bosun, Huang Huaisheng, Bian Yuying, Li Dashen, and Shao Cunren were elected as executive committee members. Ren Pengnian, Shen Dayin, Dan Duyu, Gao Tianqi, and Hu Xin Huixin were elected as alternate executive committee members. Bai Hongji, Lu Jie, and Li Minwei were elected as supervisory committee members. Zhong Shigen was elected as an alternate supervisory committee member. After the election results were announced, the oath of office was taken, and the ceremony was completed. At 7:00 PM, dinner was held in the hall on the sixth floor, which was attended by many people, and they dispersed happily until 10:00 PM.

### American "China Showroom" to Ship Domestic Products Next Month

China Industrial and Commercial Association Participating in Production; Goods from Singapore Exhibition Hall to Ship Immediately

The University of Gellerford, USA, has recently built a large-scale peace memorial hall, and is collecting historical cultures and special products from various countries for display. A special China special products showroom is set up to display special products of China. The US side specifically asked the Foreign Ministry to transfer the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to collect them. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has ordered the International Trade Bureau to handle it. According to the reporter of Shenzhou News Agency, after receiving the order, the International Trade Bureau collected from various manufacturers in the city. Members of the China Industrial and Foreign Trade Association, in view of the prosperity of Sino-US trade, believed that displaying China's special products was extremely beneficial to foreign trade, so they enthusiastically participated. Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Family Industry Cooperative, China Chemical Industry Cooperative, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, and China Enamel Factory have all produced products. The first batch has now been sent to the International Trade Bureau by the China Industrial and Foreign Trade Association. It is reported that the International Trade Bureau will ship them to the United States for display next month after the collection ends in two weeks. Products on cultural and historical aspects are handled by the Ministry of Education. In addition, the China Industrial and Foreign Trade Association initiated the establishment of a national goods exhibition hall on the second floor of the Bank of China in Singapore. It was officially established last month. The Shanghai office is located on the seventh floor of the Dalu Department Store. Participating manufacturers include Meiya, Wuhe, and other twenty companies. The layout in Singapore is now largely complete. The board of directors of the museum has sent a letter to Singaporean overseas Chinese business leader Chen Yueshu, inviting him to serve as the director of the museum, and to discuss shipping and layout methods. Once Mr. Chen replies to Shanghai within days, the goods of the participating manufacturers in the city will be shipped to Singapore for display.

### American Geographer Grosvenor Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Sending Two Teams to Observe Solar Eclipse; Good Results Expected; Couple Flew Across the Pacific for the First Time

Mr. Grosvenor, President of the National Geographic Society of the United States, recently traveled to the Far East with his wife. He first flew from San Francisco to Hong Kong on a Pan American Airways Clipper, and arrived in Shanghai on the Lincoln President on Saturday. He plans to stay in China for two weeks. Although Mr. Grosvenor's trip is for pleasure, he used this opportunity to personally witness the departure of the two solar eclipse observation teams sent by the National Geographic Society. The first team took the US ship Avocet from Honolulu to the Phoenix Islands to observe the total solar eclipse on June 8. The nature and climate of the island are expected to obtain the best solar eclipse observation in about a thousand years, so Mr. Grosvenor attaches great importance to the work of this team. The second team is a joint team of the National Geographic Society and Lingnan University. It departed from Guangzhou to northern Jiangsu last week and is also expected to obtain abundant academic materials. Mr. Grosvenor is very happy to meet the leader of the team. Mr. Grosvenor traveled to Manchuria in 1928. As for the mainland of China, this is his first visit. It is said that he plans to stay in Shanghai for two or three days, then take the train to the capital to meet his old friend, US Ambassador Johnson, and then go to Tokyo to stay for a month, because his son-in-law is currently the secretary of the US Embassy there. According to reports, the National Geographic Society initially had only about 900 members. Later, thanks to Mr. Grosvenor's efforts, the total number of members has now reached 1.2 million, spread all over the world. China also has more than 2,000 members. Mr. Grosvenor has been serving in the association for 38 years. Since 1903, he has also served as the editor-in-chief of the society's geographic magazine. Mr. Grosvenor greatly praised the Clipper's aviation business across the Pacific. It was the first time a couple flew across the Pacific, starting with Mr. Grosvenor and his wife.

### Exhibition of Ancient Pottery by the Wu-Yue History and Geography Research Association

The Wu-Yue History and Geography Research Association has recently excavated a large number of ancient pottery in Hangzhou and other places, all of which have historical value. They are currently being sorted out and will soon be held at the Dasi Department Store. It is also known that the Jiaxing branch of the association is actively preparing and can be established within days.

### Joint Meeting of Various Groups Resolves to Support the New Salt Law

Discussing Convening a Representative Assembly Tomorrow; Petitioning the Yuan and Ministry in Beijing When Necessary; Salt Administration Experts Issue Important Remarks

The Ministry of Finance believes that the tax rate of the new salt law is very different from the current tax rate. It is deeply feared that the implementation will affect the source of tax revenue. It intends to change the word "kilogram" in the tax rate of the new salt law to "market catty", which is close to the current tax rate. After the Central Political Council passed it and handed it over to the Legislative Yuan for investigation by various circles in the city, if the case is reviewed by the Finance and Legal System Committee of the Legislative Yuan, the tax rate will be doubled, which will be of great concern to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Expert Talk

Reporters visited a salt administration expert to inquire about everything, since the amendment of the new salt law involves national policy. According to the expert, the new salt law has been promulgated for six years. The financial authorities are deeply worried that the original tax revenue will be difficult to maintain after implementation, so it has not been implemented for a long time. But according to actual facts, it is the opposite. The right to sell salt is in the hands of merchants, monopolizing and exploiting the government and the people. The new law stipulates that the people are free to buy and sell, and after one tax, they can go anywhere. The abuses of merchants are naturally eliminated. Because of trade competition, the price of salt must be low, and the low price will increase the amount of consumption, and the tax revenue will also increase. As for the salt tax revenue of 200 million yuan in recent years, the implementation of the new law will reduce the income of the national treasury because the tax rate is too low. It is not the same as the current salt tax revenue, which is equivalent to eating money, and the huge salt affairs expenditure, the actual income of the national treasury is only 150 million yuan. If the new Han is taken as an example, the tax rate does not have to be increased. The national salt sales amount should be increased to 90 million dan, and the salt income can reach 220 million yuan, which is 50 million yuan more than the current tax revenue. All the expenses of the salt affairs organs, anti-smuggling military police, can also be reduced by at least 10 million yuan. Therefore, the tax rate set in the new law does not seem to need to be revised.

If the weather does not quickly turn clear, the rice market will continue to weaken.

### The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Provides Relief to Guizhou, Gansu, and Sichuan

The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association at No. 97 Renji Road has first announced the disaster situation and broadly appealed for the drought disasters in Henan, Gansu, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces. Initially, they jointly sent personnel with the Shanghai Chinese Relief Association to actively provide relief in Dengxian County, Henan Province, distributing a total of over 60,000 yuan in relief funds. The leaders of the association, Yang Shan and Zheng Shouchang, recently sent a letter, which is transcribed as follows: "We have investigated the households in 43 Lianbao in Dengfeng, totaling 18,896 households. The number of people receiving relief, including adults and children, totals over 80,000. Statistics show that 55,953 yuan has been distributed, and over 8,990 catties of porridge rice and over 40 yuan in work relief. Fortunately, our association provided timely relief first, saving countless disaster victims. Now, the officials, gentry, and common people of the county are all deeply grateful for the benefits of the two associations. The actual benefits to the disaster victims are not insignificant. However, since April 12, when rain fell in various counties in western Henan, there have been several cloudy days. Since the 20th, it has been sunny until now, almost a month, without any rain. As a result, the cotton planted earlier has been dried to death. Therefore, people are anxious and restless all day long, and those who flee the famine are seen again. It is deeply regrettable." The association, seeing that Guizhou, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces have successively reported emergencies, has not only wired the relief funds in batches to various branch associations to handle them quickly, but also plans to transfer personnel who were providing relief in Henan to Guizhou, Gansu, and Sichuan to guide the relief work of various branch associations and to inspect disaster prevention projects in various places. However, this time the disaster is widespread in the four provinces, the funds are insufficient, and there are many people in need. We hope that all sectors will provide continuous assistance.

### Shanghai Islamic Organizations Warmly Celebrate the Prophet Muhammad's Birthday

Over Three Thousand Chinese and Foreign Guests Attended; Promoting the Doctrine of Peace and Salvation

The Municipal Islamic Association and various mosques, as well as the Yisilan School and Yunsheng Elementary School and other Islamic organizations, held a grand celebration of the Prophet Muhammad's birthday yesterday at the Chinese Islamic Association Auditorium on Qinglian Street in the city. The details of the meeting are described below:

Venue Decoration

At the entrance of the meeting, a large pine and cypress archway was erected, with a horizontal banner reading "Shanghai Islamic Association" Various Mosque Celebrating the Prophet Muhammad's Birthday Meeting." Inside the gate were the guest signing area and the organization representative signing area. To the left were the staff lounge and the meeting office. Various slogans were posted all around the playground, and a public address system was installed to broadcast the meeting. In the auditorium was the speaker's platform, and the guest seats, etc. A side room served as a reception room for receiving guests.

Meeting Staff

The presidium of the meeting included: Ha Decheng, Da Pusheng, Wu Yongxia, Mai Junshan, Fang Zijie, etc. The general secretary was Xie Ke, the director of reception was Ma Tianying, the director of affairs was Da Jisheng, and the director of general affairs was Ha Zi'an.

Meeting Situation

The meeting began at 10:30 AM, with over three thousand Chinese and foreign guests attending. First, the chairman reported, followed by a speech by Reverend Da Pusheng, who briefly stated that the Prophet Muhammad's achievements could be summarized numerically as perseverance, justice, peace, and struggle. If we can follow this spirit, we can save China from its current crisis. Then, Mr. Tang Ke Yi from the Central Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission delivered a speech, generally saying, "The spirit of Islam surpasses everything. Sun Yat-sen said that to succeed in the revolution, we must unite Chinese Muslims." Chiang Kai-shek said, "Although the Islamic prohibition on eating pork is for health, their tenacious spirit is also sufficient to resist the enemy. All these noble spirits are the legacy of the Prophet Muhammad, so we must commemorate him." Afterwards, foreign guests Mr. H. Tonty, Mr. Savul, and guests from Turkey and Russia delivered speeches one after another, translated by Mr. Yang Jiashan and Mr. Ma Tianfu.

The Fuyou Road Mosque and the Shanghai Islamic Association both decorated with lanterns to celebrate.

### Another False Alarm on Haining Road

Japanese Injured While Playing with a Handgun; Police Investigate and Reprimand for False Report

According to a Japanese-language Shanghai Daily report translated by the Foreign News Agency, at around 10 PM on the 22nd, the Japanese Consulate Police Station received a report of an anti-Japanese terrorist incident on Haining Road, near Park Lane, with a Japanese person injured. The police were immediately dispatched to the scene, and soon after, police officers from the Public Concession also arrived, creating a tense atmosphere. It was later determined that the alleged attack was fabricated and the report was false, ending the farcical incident. The injured person was identified as Koga Sadakichi, originally from Isemachi 35, Nagasaki City, and residing at Hankou Road 131, near Miller Road 347, employed by Yokoyama Yosho Clothing Store. That night, he and two friends, Kinoshita and Ogawa, borrowed a small handgun from a certain Takahashi (of mixed race). While playing with it, he accidentally triggered the mechanism, injuring his left hand. In great pain, he left Ogawa behind and rushed with Kinoshita to Fumin Hospital for treatment. After surgery, the bullet was removed, but unwilling to reveal the truth, he falsely claimed that he was suddenly shot by an unknown person while passing Park Lane. Fumin Hospital immediately reported the incident to the Japanese Consulate Police Station, which was greatly alarmed. On one hand, they notified the Public Concession authorities, and on the other hand, Police Chief Tajima led police officers to the scene for a major search under serious tension. However, they were unable to find any concrete evidence. As a result of a serious interrogation of the victim and Kinoshita at the police station, they finally confessed the above facts, causing great indignation among the Japanese authorities, who severely reprimanded them.

### Increasing Number of Rickshaws Idle in Nanshi

Concerns about Business Prospects

Nanshi used to have 5,950 rickshaws. Since some rickshaws from the western and northern areas of Shanghai acquired French Concession licenses to operate, the number of rickshaws has increased by more than 1,000, greatly alleviating the burdens on rickshaw pullers. However, with the increasing expansion of public buses and tram lines, rickshaws have reached a dead end. Rickshaw pullers have only been able to lower fares to accommodate passengers, but passengers prefer public buses and trams. Furthermore, with a relatively good autumn harvest in the Jiangbei area, laborers and poor people can easily make a living in the countryside and are unwilling to come to Shanghai to seek employment or change occupations to earn a living. As a result, the number of rickshaw pullers has gradually decreased, leading to the current phenomenon of excess rickshaws. In areas like Lujiabang Road, from Xie Bridge to Nanmatou, traditionally a gathering place for rickshaw owners large and small in Nanshi, rickshaws are piled up, with idle rickshaws parked in front of doors everywhere. At a time when rubber and metal prices have risen by more than one-third, and license fees and monthly dues are

### Major Gambling Den Broken Up on Dixwell Road

Raids Carried Out Repeatedly Until Break-Up Yesterday Morning; Twenty-One Gamblers of Various Nationalities Arrested

The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau had previously received several confidential reports stating that a large number of Russian vagrants and others had pooled funds to secretly establish a large-scale gambling den at 424 Dixwell Road, which is Lane 994, No. 4 in the Chinese district. The gamblers inside were of various nationalities, gambling day and night with huge stakes. The house had hired unemployed people to act as lookouts in front and in back, and the interior was decorated like a dance hall, with temporary arrangements for quickly destroying gambling equipment. All gambling funds were represented by chips. Therefore, although the police bureau had repeatedly ordered the Beisichuan Road Branch, the Inspectorate, and the Police Brigade to conduct raids, they had been unsuccessful due to the extraordinary cunning and thorough precautions of these individuals. However, the investigation continued tirelessly. Yesterday morning, at around 3:00 AM, Detective Squad Leader Liu Huai secretly dispatched Third Squad Leader Shan Bin and First Squad Leader Bai Zhongqi, along with detectives and police officers from the Beisichuan Road Branch, all disguised as gamblers. They first monitored the lookouts at the front and back doors, then forced open the front door and rushed into the inner room, guarding the lookouts there as well before storming up to the second floor. At this time, the gamblers were excitedly placing bets. Upon seeing a large number of detectives enter the room, they were all stunned and tried to escape, but were stopped by the detectives and arrested one by one. In total, twenty-one male and female gamblers were apprehended, along with four decks of playing cards, forty chips, and eighty-seven yuan in gambling money. All were immediately taken back to the Beisichuan Road Police Station. After a brief interrogation, two Japanese gamblers, Otani Tomio and Kumon Kinie, were transferred to the Japanese Consulate for further investigation. Others, such as Russian Belesnyak, Greek S. Kyriakides, British national G. O’Hara, and three Russian women, were all sent to the General Bureau for disposition.

Indispensable, many owners with more than ten rickshaws are pulling their own rickshaws on the streets to make up the difference. Owners with fewer rickshaws are also complaining bitterly. This year's large number of rickshaws being idled is unprecedented. The scorching summer heat is especially worrying.

### Dispute over Air Conditioning Project Commission; Yu Xin Yao Threatened

Shareholders Disagree; Broker Takes Opportunity; Yu Imprisoned and Threatened During Negotiations in a Hotel

The Hezhong Air Conditioning Company at 220 Jiangxi Road was established by Yu Xinyao, Zhou Wenhua, Zhang Gongqing, and the elder brother of Gao Ji’an, among seven shareholders, and has been in operation for ten years. In January of this year, the company's broker, Ji Luchi, secured an air conditioning project for the Huangbai Fishing Industry Cooperative in Weihaiwei, estimated at over 40,000 yuan. It was initially agreed that Ji's commission would be 3,500 yuan, with 1,300 yuan paid in advance, and the remaining commission to be paid after the client settled the account. Unexpectedly, recently, disagreements arose among the shareholders of Hezhong Air Conditioning Company. Zhou Wenhua, Zhang Gongqing, and others even wanted to expel Yu Xinyao to seize full control. At that time, Ji Luchi learned that Hezhong Company could make a profit of over 20,000 from the Huangbai Fishing Industry Cooperative project he had secured. Therefore, his commission should be increased to 8,800 yuan. He negotiated with Yu and then colluded with Zhou Wenhua, Zhang Gongqing, Gao Ji’an, and others. At 2:30 PM on the day before yesterday, they invited Yu Xinyao to negotiate in Room 238 of the New World Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. As soon as Yu entered the room, he was monitored by these individuals who threatened and forced him to agree to the increased commission. Seeing that he was outnumbered and unable to escape, Yu attempted to jump out of the window. Because the room faced the racecourse, he was stopped by these individuals and moved to Room 243. At the same time, they sent Yong native Ye Ahong to Yu's home at 111 Yulin Lane, Pingliang Road, using intimidation tactics to trick Yu's brother into handing over two Hezhong Air Conditioning Company share certificates (each with a face value of 1,000 yuan). They also had Yu's friend Xu Jingliang come forward to write a guarantee, promising that each of the seven shareholders of the company would pay 1,080 yuan to settle the matter. Afterwards, Yu, along with witness Wang Jinmei, reported the incident to the Chengdu Road Police Station and ordered Chinese Detective Sun Wenxi to go to the New World Hotel to make arrests, but no one was there. Later, Yong native Ye Ahong and Shandong native Wang Yuguo (formerly Wang Mingwen, working as a secretary) were apprehended and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Judge Li Zhishan, a lawyer at the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, who prosecuted them for the crime of intimidation under Article 246 of the Criminal Code and stated that there were still accomplices at large, requesting a postponement. According to Yu Xinyao's complaint, Ye Ahong confessed to being instructed by Zhou Wenhua to go to the plaintiff's home to retrieve the share certificates, while Wang Yuguo confessed to being invited by Zhou Wenhua to collect debts. The rest of their testimonies were evasive. They hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them in court. Judge Huang questioned them extensively and ordered the two defendants to be detained for seven days for further questioning.

### The Four Robbers in the Schembrau Robbery Case Committed Continuous Robbery

Cannot Be Sentenced Again According to Law; Special Court Two Rules for Dismissal

Zhou Jinggeng, the comprador of Schembrau Accounting Firm at 9 Edward Road in the French Concession, sent someone on June 9, 1934, at 3:00 PM, to withdraw 18,000 yuan in new banknotes from the China Industrial Bank, intending to take them to the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track that night. Before long, robbers armed with weapons stormed into the office and stole 12,000 yuan. After reporting to the French police, four people were arrested on suspicion: Zhang Zuming (shareholder of Ruixingshun Hardware Store), Zhuang Jimeng (owner of Zhuangyuan Store), Wang Lianyou (hardware broker), and Tang Qingyue (president of Dade Hospital). They were sent to Special Court Two, which declared them not guilty. After the Supreme Court upheld the verdict in the third instance, Zhang, Zhuang, and Zhou successively filed lawsuits against each other for false accusation, with related civil suits. They were also found not guilty. In the winter of 1941, four robbers, Huang Aying, Huang Xixiang, Wang Zhengji, and Fang Jingui, were arrested for committing multiple robberies in the Public Concession. They were tried by the First Special District Court, sentenced to imprisonment, and sent to prison. Due to the harsh conditions in the Public Concession Prison, Huang and the other three confessed to robbing the Schembrau Accounting Firm in the French Concession, as well as robbing three properties of the Shaanxi Bank. They requested to be transferred to the French Concession Special Court Two Prison to serve their sentences in a more comfortable environment. The First Special Prison notified the French police, who transferred Huang and the other three to Special Court Two for prosecution. The details of the investigation have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Judge Liao, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of Special Court Two, has concluded the trial, considering that Huang and the other three committed continuous robbery and had already been sentenced by the First Special District Court. Therefore, Special Court Two cannot sentence them again according to law, and ruled for dismissal of the case. Currently, Huang and the other prisoners are still detained in the Special Court Two Detention Center, hoping to serve their sentences in the Special Court Two Prison. There are still questions about this.

### Grand Occasion of the Guangdong Art Exhibition

### Letter

Respectful greetings, yesterday, after reading the local news in the May 19th issue of your esteemed newspaper, regarding the matter of Zhou Zibin and his son allegedly seducing the Huang mother and daughter, I could not help but be surprised. Zibin certainly has three sons: the eldest, Jiaqi; the second, Jiaji; and the third, Jiarong, all of whom have long been married. This is widely known. Wang Guangde is a student in my eldest son's shop. Last year, on the 20th day of the eighth lunar month, through a matchmaker, he became engaged to Zhu Aying, the daughter of Huang Dufang and her ex-husband Zhu Yinfu, at the Xinbanzhai on Sanma Road. Although Zibin was invited by Wang Guangde to attend, he left after the meal. There were eight or nine male and female guests present at the time. Although the Huang mother and daughter were present, Zibin did not know them and there was no possibility of intimacy. As for the events of last October, when Huang's divorced husband, Zhu Yinfu, contested the right to arrange Aying's marriage, they were taken to the Public Security Bureau and sent to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office. After investigation, it was determined that the case was a civil matter and was rejected. Afterwards, Huang's brother, Huang Yulin, asked the original matchmaker, Huang Jiu'an, to mediate with Zibin, instructing Guangde to hand over thirty-nine yuan of the dowry to Zhu Yinfu, who then voluntarily wrote a statement agreeing to the marriage of his niece Aying to Wang Guangde, which Huang received. Afterwards, Huang Yulin signed the agreement on the spot, and Wang Guangde prepared a statement of support for his mother-in-law and marriage certificates for both parties, which they each kept. After the wedding on the eleventh day of the eleventh lunar month, both parties lived in harmony without incident. Wang Guangde is now suspended from my eldest son's shop. Huang harbors ulterior motives and often goes out with her daughter without returning home. Disagreements arose between the mother-in-law and son-in-law. Guangde asked matchmaker Dong Jiu'an and Zibin to persuade her, which led to an argument with Huang. Zibin, realizing it was none of his business, ceased to intervene. As for the events of the 26th of last month, when the Huang mother and daughter packed their belongings and ran away without returning, Wang Guangde reported it to the police, which had nothing to do with Zibin. Unexpectedly, Huang suspected that Zibin was the instigator and first entrusted lawyer Tang Xingjian to send a letter of intimidation. Then, lawyer Tang asked someone to demand 300 yuan from Zibin to settle the matter. I believed there was no basis for this and refused. She was enraged and, still represented by lawyer Tang, fabricated a slanderous accusation of seduction against Zibin at the First Special District Court. Zibin filed a countersuit, and the case has been summoned for trial. Huang, upon learning that Guangde had filed a lawsuit for shared wife, again had lawyer Tang file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against her son-in-law for seducing her daughter, hoping to influence the case. During the trial on May 18th, the testimonies of the Huang mother and daughter were inconsistent. The court considered the matter to be a marital issue and ordered the countersuitor, Wang Guangde, to file a civil suit. Before a determination is made, the criminal case will be suspended. Zibin, having suffered this injustice, cannot remain silent. In addition to resorting to legal measures, I dare to request a prompt correction in accordance with Article 14 of the Publishing Law to avoid confusing public opinion. Respectfully yours, Zhou Zibin, respectfully inscribed. Upon reading the section in your newspaper's local news column concerning me allegedly assaulting Yao Fenglin with a group of people, I was deeply surprised. Whether or not Yao was assaulted, I had no knowledge of it beforehand, and I have not heard about it afterwards. Moreover, after 2:00 PM on the 17th, I was purchasing goods at the Rixin North Goods Store on Foreign Firm Street in the French Concession and then playing mahjong with colleagues. How could I have been in two places at once? This kind of critical behavior clearly has a background. The claim that I was "ordered to post bail but could not raise the cash and was thus imprisoned for one night" is even more ridiculous. In addition to filing a countersuit according to law, I hereby request a correction to avoid confusing the public. I am infinitely grateful. Respectfully yours, Gong Jingyan, May 23rd.

### Jin Cheng Bank Business Report for the Republic of China Year 25 (Continued)

㊄ Special Services Provided by the Bank to Society in Year 25

The Bank's general services to society are based on commercial finance as a paradigm. However, recognizing the inadequacies in the socio-economic institutions and equipment of various countries and the incomplete realization of their functions, the Bank, in accordance with the demands of the times and the benefits of construction, and in areas where specialized finance has not yet become widespread, has also followed its guiding principles of service. Based on the principles of investment, it has either independently or in collaboration with other businesses provided assistance. The following is a summary of the special services:

(A) Subsidies for Small-Scale Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Enterprises

Since its inception in Year 23, the Bank has worked with local governments to jointly establish small-scale loan offices. The number of these offices has increased each year, so their geographical distribution has gradually expanded, and the existing offices have also gradually enriched their content and expanded their services. A summary of their general conditions is shown in the table below:

In addition, the National Academic Work Consulting Office has jointly organized small industrial loans with the Bank. Graduates in engineering from domestic and foreign universities who aspire to start small industrial enterprises but are financially weak, if they meet social needs and use mostly domestic raw materials, may apply for assistance. Currently, those who have passed the review and signed agreements for financing include the China Standard National Leasing Pencil Factory, among others. As for the Bank's own small loan program, it continues to be implemented to supplement the shortcomings of the aforementioned small-scale loan programs.

(B) Assistance to the Rural Economy

(I) Assistance to Agricultural Improvement in North China

The Bank has long collaborated with agricultural education institutions to form the North China Agricultural Research and Improvement Association. This year, it has continued to promote its work under the centralized organization of the Hebei Cotton Production Improvement Association. The Association plans to increase the cotton acreage in the province by 10 million mu and the production of fine-staple cotton by 4 million dan within five years, using the most effective methods. This will help develop domestic cotton production, gradually achieve self-sufficiency, and eventually export large quantities to benefit the country and its people. This year's work includes "investigation," "experimentation," "water conservancy," and guidance in the cotton-producing areas, dissemination of high-quality seeds, and assistance in cooperative undertakings. The required bank financing includes "production," "drilling wells," "selection and sale," and "utilization" loans, which the Bank and its partners have been willing to undertake. Currently, the various cooperatives under its guidance are becoming more organized, with more than 700 cooperatives and over 17,000 members, who are able to maintain mutual support and work together for progress.

(II) Joint Efforts for Agricultural Cooperative Loans

The China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate, which the Bank formed in collaboration with other banks, continued to operate as usual this year. However, the number of participating banks has changed to nine, and the total amount of funds has been changed to 2.5 million yuan. The Bank is responsible for one-fifth of this amount and allocates funds as needed. In addition to continuing to provide loans in the Hebei and Shaanxi (including Shanxi) regions, and with cotton production and sales as the loan targets, Anhui Province has been added this year to handle farmers' association storage and loan services, temporarily limited to rice and wheat. The Hebei office is still set up and managed by the Bank. In total, the "production," "marketing," "utilization," and "storage" loans in the three provinces reached over 700,000 yuan. The number of cooperatives receiving direct loans has increased to more than 330, and there are seven agricultural warehouses. The loan areas and types have increased this year, and the distribution of cooperative loans is more widespread than in previous years, indicating that the business has progressed. In the future, further efforts should be made to work with other businesses to promote rural services. In addition, the Lingbao and Zhangde cotton packing plants continue to be jointly operated with other businesses. The Fishery Syndicate has also participated in its establishment and provided appropriate assistance.

(C) Assistance to the Transportation Industry

It is universally recognized that China urgently needs to build a modern transportation and transportation system, so it is unnecessary to elaborate further. This year, our bank, for the railway construction that is most important in the transportation industry, has repeatedly engaged in financing with other banks, or has acted as an example of its humble contributions. Since a year, there have been Zheyang Railway Nanping section loan, Longhai Railway Laoyaogang continued loan, Guangzhou-Hankou Railway for the expansion of rolling stock equipment of the mortgage overdraft, and Pinghan Railway for the development of road business of the mortgage overdraft, and at the end of the year decided to jointly undertake the Jing-Gan Railway Xuangui section loan, and the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Chengyu section investment. As for the engineering advance payment for the Xibao section of the Longhai Railway, this year we continue to be responsible for the delivery with other businesses, and continue to handle the payment of insurance materials, in order to contribute to the railway administration. In addition, the construction of highways in various provinces and the development of private shipping, this year have also made considerable investments together or alone to assist. (To be continued)

### Women and Appearance

— Yi Ren

Recently, a young woman, described as "beautiful and fashionable," was stabbed in the face. Despite medical treatment, a scar remains on her left cheek. The assailant was apprehended at the scene. During the court hearing the other day, the plaintiff's lawyer, in outlining the reasons for the lawsuit and the requested damages, stated, "Damage to appearance is particularly important for women. If a woman's appearance is harmed, men will be displeased, potentially causing problems in their relationships. The scar on the victim's left cheek is not only unsightly but also affects her future prospects..."

At first glance, this statement may seem somewhat inappropriate. Gender equality is enshrined in the provisional constitution, and all professions should be free from discrimination based on appearance. Furthermore, enlightened individuals have long asserted that romantic relationships should be based on compatibility in temperament, unity of thought, and shared interests, knowledge, and so forth, with "appearance" being secondary. However, reality paints a vastly different picture. It is said that Zhaojun was relegated to the cold palace because the "treacherous official" Mao Yanshou deliberately distorted her portrait. While we live in a capitalist era with slightly different circumstances, most companies hiring female employees still require photographs, and those deemed less attractive have a significantly lower chance of being selected—a publicly known secret. As for jobs nominally for women but essentially involving selling their youth, such as dance hostesses and guides, the situation is even more obvious. Therefore, the statement that "if a woman's appearance is harmed, men will be displeased…affecting her future prospects" is a truly heartfelt expression.

Why is a woman's appearance so closely linked to her life's path? This conclusion stems from the fact that society remains male-centered, and women are still often treated as objects of male entertainment. Consequently, they are compelled to prioritize "beautiful appearance and fashionable attire" as their goals. However, I don't intend to conclude this short essay with such a simplistic explanation. I'm not merely trying to be novel or sensational by offering a counterargument, suggesting that extravagant attire incites lust and that women are to blame for their plight. Instead, I've been prompted to consider other aspects and would like to take this opportunity to discuss them.

Women's misfortunes are not a recent phenomenon. It seems that they have become even more acute lately. Considering recent events, from the coronation of the British monarch to Shanghai, women have suffered numerous immediate losses. Furthermore, women are disproportionately represented in recent suicide and homicide cases, often under bizarre and bewildering circumstances. Upon closer examination, the underlying reason remains that women are treated as the private property of men. It is as if two children are vying for the same vase, and when it breaks, neither gets it. Or, because a newer, better vase is available, the old one is discarded into the trash. Or a vase is cracked, "affecting its future prospects."

These fates are lamentable. However, because of the hope and "honor" of being placed on a desk for daily admiration and appreciation, some women willingly take the chance, hoping to avoid being buried in obscurity for life.

Such thinking isn't necessarily wrong. People, especially the vulnerable, tend to choose the easiest and most upwardly mobile path, don't they? However, while optimistically planning on that path, one must also be selective and discerning. As a result, many are rejected. The criteria men use to choose women invariably include "beautiful appearance and fashionable attire."

Therefore, those who are not naturally beautiful or fashionable strive to "dress up" to be chosen, while those who are already beautiful and fashionable can't afford to be harmed, lest it "affect their future prospects."

Is this a comedy or a tragedy for women? When will it end?

### Youth Leisure Activities in Various Countries (Continued from Yesterday)

The only male speaker that day was Mr. Goodier, who discussed American youth leisure activities. He stated that the most active organizations enabling 40 million young North Americans to make good use of their free time are: ⑴ the family, ⑵ the school, ⑶ the church, and ⑷ all organizations that "build character." The fourth category includes the YMCA and YWCA, the Young Men's and Women's Hebrew Associations, the Catholic Youth Organization, Boy Scouts, Boys' Clubs, the Civilian Conservation Corps, and the National Youth Administration. The most important category of youth leisure is undoubtedly the family. Generally, young people desire to find a lover, become a couple, and have a family with children. American boys and girls, from elementary school to middle school, high school, and university, work together until they form families. An organized family is the most natural and ordinary center of all their activities, enabling young people to develop the finest concepts of marriage and family life. The atmosphere in most middle-class American homes serves as a model for the happiness that most young people hope for. A 20-year-old man who falls in love with a girl and wishes to rely on her to build a family always enjoys being with her when he goes out and even more enjoys gathering with her in the family. The companionship and shared interests fostered by good family leisure activities in America are indeed the most important and unparalleled factors in young people's lives. The important tasks of schools and churches are closely linked to the influence of families. Parents are mostly proud of their children's participation in art exhibitions, drama clubs, and various sporting events hosted by schools and churches. In addition to the leisure opportunities provided by schools and churches, there are clubs everywhere where young people can spend their free time, and they also organize many social and religious activities themselves. "Character-building" organizations are also a major factor in American youth life. Their annual expenses amount to millions of US dollars, all donated by public-spirited individuals. Many of these organizations start influencing children from the age of eight or ten. They encourage young people to organize groups themselves under the guidance of experts, thus preventing many impoverished children from being influenced by evil forces and becoming hooligans. They recognize that spending leisure time in legitimate entertainment can reduce youth crime and promote their happy lives. There are a total of five million young Americans who are unemployed due to the recession. Therefore, in 1933, the US government established the Civilian Conservation Corps, recruiting 350,000 young people aged 18 to 25 from families living on welfare. On workdays, they are sent to forests to plant seedlings, cut down dead trees, help fight forest fires, eliminate plant pests, engage in flood control work, build roads, and care for national parks and forests. After work, they enjoy organized entertainment and read books to increase their knowledge. The National Youth Administration is the second most important step in assisting youth. Their procedures are divided into four categories: ⑴ finding jobs for unemployed youth, ⑵ providing training and retraining opportunities for youth to acquire technical and professional skills, ⑶ providing tuition for youth to continue their studies in higher schools and universities, and ⑷ creating relief work to meet the needs of youth. A year ago, they subsidized 109,000 poor college students in 1,600 universities and subsidized 315,000 boys and girls in public high schools. Local city councils also set up many leisure centers for young people, with 400 playgrounds in New York City alone. Therefore, American youth have many opportunities for leisure activities, with the aim of making them better and happier citizens.

Next, Mrs. Matsumoto described the youth movement in Japan, saying: When the current Emperor was Crown Prince, he visited England in 1921 and felt that the Boy Scout and Girl Scout movements were very beneficial to young people. After returning to Japan, he founded them in his own country. However, everything is Japanized, with a slight religious flavor on the one hand and the implementation of Japan's inherent Bushido spirit on the other. This foreign plan, which has not been established for long, naturally has many difficulties, but it has become an integral part of the government school system. In remote small towns, the Seinendan movement is implemented, providing basic military training to older youth. Originally, it only accepted boys, but now it also accepts girls. The Young Men's and Women's Associations, like those in other countries, provide young people with educational and physical training. Large stores provide amusement parks for young employees at very low prices. There are also bride schools for girls to learn grooming methods. There is now a very special school in Tokyo, founded by Mrs. Hani, which originally only accepted girls, but now also accepts boys from kindergarten to university. The school does not employ servants and teaches students to do all practical work. Mrs. Hani's ideal is that Japanese women should learn a way of life that allows them to have some rest time each day. Her devout religious faith, noble cultivation, and determined character have gained her many supporters across the country, who have formed a group called the Asano Association. In short, although the number of youth organizations in Japan is not large, young people have realized the importance of organization and are now moving forward.

In these two days of meetings, several members presented papers on youth leisure activities. The most admirable was Mrs. Newns, who, despite being in the midst of mourning the loss of her husband, still wrote a paper entitled "Categories of Leisure for Chinese Women" and entrusted someone to read it on her behalf. Mrs. Newns' dedication to public welfare is truly exceptional. Finally, Miss Hind, head of the Industrial Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and one of the founders of the Joint Committee, concluded the discussion,整理各人發表的意見，决定四要點如下：㊀共同委員會應編訂一種消閒機會的目錄，跟提倡改善公共圖書館的狀况，㊁應該利用𣺣江大學所供給的機會，彌補業餘文化跟敎育兩課的缺陷，㊂提議蒐集材料，由共同委員會用傳單式供獻給大衆，再在報章公布，常常使人注意，㊃提議共同委員會應跟各國人的團體常相接觸。那第一項是因為有許多人雖然知道消閒的機會，但還有許多全然不知道從何處覓取同樣的機會。公共圖書館雖備有許多書籍雜誌，但地方還嫌狹窄，並且沒有精究跟靜閱的室所，今擬請工部局在圖書館中闢一靜閱室。第二項因為上海的靑年男女，很多沒有受到文化上的充分訓練，以致不能有遠大的前途，𣺣江大學分校很願意對於有充分需要的任何課程，開班敎授，收取極微的學費，使無力的靑年都有繼續上進的機會。第三第四兩項都是預備共同委員會謀將來擴充活動範圍起見。

### Spring Stage Opera

— Ying Dai

Although spring has passed, spring stage opera has not disappeared in the countryside. Indeed, farmers sow in the summer, harvest in the autumn, and process rice in the winter. Only in the spring do they have relatively more free time. With free time, they naturally seek entertainment, but in the countryside, there are no theaters or cinemas. Therefore, to see opera, they have to pool money to hire a troupe to come to the village. Such performances are often done under the pretext of thanking the gods and, because they take place in the spring, are traditionally called "spring stage opera."

Spring stage opera can be divided into civil troupes and martial troupes. Civil troupes perform Kun opera, while martial troupes specialize in acrobatics and fighting scenes. "Wu Song's Revenge at Mandarin Duck Tower," where the martial artist jumps over five or six tables, or "The Complete Iron Rooster," where the adult's groom flips seventeen or eighteen somersaults. The troupes are usually hired from Suzhou or Hangzhou. A day's performance is called a "book," and the cost is fifty or sixty yuan, or even a hundred yuan, per day. To hire them, you need to book at least two or three days in advance, otherwise, you might not be able to get them.

When a village is going to put on a spring stage opera, the news spreads everywhere in advance. Those who want to see the opera crane their necks and wait eagerly. Because there are few places doing spring stage opera in recent years, the villagers' desire to see opera is extremely fervent. Therefore, whenever there is a spring stage opera, it is sure to cause a sensation in the surrounding towns and villages, and those peddlers who specialize in chasing festivals and opera venues also set up stalls at the opera venue to sell goods.

The venue for spring stage opera is quite pathetic, truly worlds apart from the stages in Shanghai. In a field of several tens of acres, a reed mat shed is erected facing south, with several statues of gods placed under the shed. Facing north, a stage is built. The open space in the middle is for the audience to stand. Both sides are filled with various stalls. Furthermore, local gentry or people with influence build stands for their female relatives and friends to watch, to avoid being squeezed.

The stage has nothing but tables and chairs, with no other furnishings. There are no backdrops whatsoever. If you are not sitting on the stand and are standing in the venue watching the opera, you are squeezed in front, with people pushing to the point of wanting to live, tip-toeing and raising your head to watch the opera, feeling like you can't take it. Standing behind, you can't hear anything being sung. Women are afraid of complaining too much because they can't stand for long. Watching a day's opera is more tiring than doing three days of work, especially when the weather is hot, unable to withstand the sun overhead. If you open an umbrella, you block the view of the spectators behind, and you will be hated, and people will throw mud at you.

After so many people have squeezed and trampled on an opera venue for three days, the grass roots are trampled bare, and the mud is trampled sticky. When this field is plowed, it takes at least several times the effort. However, the villagers don't care at all because they all believe that the field will be extra fertile after being trampled like this, and the rice will be extra abundant. There are also opera fans who are familiar with every play, knowing the stories from The Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin by heart. Therefore, watching the opera with such people, they will not mind their dry throats and sore mouths and will meticulously narrate the opera to you.

In recent years, due to the bankruptcy of the countryside, farmers no longer have extra money to put on spring stage opera. Therefore, when spring arrives, there are fewer villages putting on spring stage opera than there were ten years ago. As a result, opera-loving friends lament that there are no operas to watch. Therefore, when a village occasionally has an opera, the news spreads, and people as far as twenty or thirty miles away will travel to watch it.

When there is opera in a village, families who have relatives and friends in that village will avoid traveling back and forth every day and will borrow a room for three or five days. However, in the midst of the decline of the countryside, problems arise. For poor families, when there is opera in the village, not offering accommodation or meals to guests seems inhospitable. However, providing accommodation and meals costs money. Under such circumstances, when putting on spring stage opera, some families even have to borrow money or pawn things to entertain guests, which is quite tragic!

After spring, summer arrives. In the early summer, there may still be places doing spring stage opera. However, after the rice seedlings have been sown and preparations are being made for transplanting, when water is put into every field, the sound of spring stage opera disappears along with the calls of the ricebird, as the farmers begin their busy work. At the same time, it is even more difficult to find a large open field to use as an opera venue.

### Echoes of "Working as a Tour Guide for a Day"

After this publication published Zhu Liying's "Working as a Tour Guide for a Day," it received letters from the Hengfeng Textile Bureau on Huasheng Road in Yangshupu and the Dawen Fountain Pen Factory on Changping Road introducing job opportunities. However, Miss Zhu did not leave a mailing address when she submitted her article, so it is published here, and it is also a good opportunity for other unemployed people.

Editor

Dear Editor:

Having read Miss Zhu Liying's self-narration of her experience working as a tour guide in your newspaper, I am filled with sympathy! In particular, I am greatly saddened when reading of her "wandering at the crossroads"! Our factory is currently recruiting female workers, especially reeling workers who must be high school graduates. It seems that Miss Zhu, having graduated from middle school, and feeling the pain of "where to go" while wandering at the crossroads, might as well condescend to work in a factory. Although life is hard, it is very stable. Miss Zhu has received secondary education. Our bureau is now very willing to train a group of instructors, that is, to fill the teaching staff with manual labor, whose position is equal to that of an employee. In the future, the salary will be at least 70 cents to more than a yuan, in addition to the factory providing food and accommodation, there will be a monthly income of twenty or thirty yuan, which is more respectable than any other profession. (Omitted below) Hengfeng Textile Bureau

Dear Sirs, We have read Miss Zhu Liying's article "Working as a Tour Guide for a Day" in your publication on the 19th, and we have just learned that she is still wandering at the crossroads. It so happens that our factory needs talents like Miss Zhu as salespersons. We hope that your publication will send a special letter to notify her. If she is interested, she can come to contact us before 11:00 am every day.
