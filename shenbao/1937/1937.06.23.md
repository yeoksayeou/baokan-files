### Guangdong Finance Department Convened a Meeting with Banks

Decided that deposits and remittances will be paid in national currency; prices have fallen since the implementation of the new currency system.

[Hong Kong] The Finance Department convened a meeting with banks on the 22nd, deciding that banks will pay all deposits and remittances in national currency starting from August 1st, and silver firms starting from September 1st. After the reduction of the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and silver dollars, prices began to fall on the 22nd, with rice falling by two dimes per dan. The Guangdong budget for the 26th year will be re-drafted by the Finance Department, using silver dollars as the base, and can be submitted to the Provincial Affairs Conference for approval after being converted at a 44% increase. Civil servants' salaries will be paid at 70% of the current amount in national currency. The provincial and municipal chambers of commerce are scheduled to hold a meeting of members during the day to discuss the issue of paying wages and rents to shops, etc. Whether to convert at a 44% increase will be a major point of contention. (22nd Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Song Ziwen, chairman of the Bank of China, was dispatched by the central government to Guangdong to handle the financial reorganization properly. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance, this reorganization aims to complete the central government's unified currency policy and also consider the local situation to meet its needs. Reports received in recent days indicate that the exchange situation is very good and prices are also becoming more flexible. The established standard of 1.44 for the exchange rate is based on the past price of Guangdong currency exchanged for silver. Therefore, the local authorities and all sectors in Guangdong are very supportive of the price set this time. The most important point is that the silver dollar system will be implemented starting from January 1st of the 27th year, as the people of Guangdong Province have repeatedly requested this. As for the current financial situation in Guangdong Province, the national treasury still subsidizes 1.8 million to 2 million yuan per month. After Director Zeng of the Finance Department reorganized the provincial treasury's income and expenditure, there is a slight surplus. (22nd Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance recently told reporters that the promulgation of the order to reform the currency system in Guangdong Province is to complete the great cause of unifying the currency system of our country. Since its implementation, officials and people in Guangdong Province have unanimously and wholeheartedly supported it, and the exchange rate and prices have been very stable, which proves the appropriateness of this measure by the government. From New Year's Day next year, national currency will be used uniformly, and fractional currency will only become a historical term. The ratio of fractional currency to legal currency has now been changed from the original flexible regulation of no more than 1.5 to a rigid regulation of 1.44. The origin of this ratio regulation is due to the request of the people of Guangdong, and also because Guangdong Province used 1.44 as the ratio when exchanging fractional currency for silver the year before last. The government, in order to take care of the interests of the people of Guangdong, did not find it appropriate to reduce the ratio below 1.44. Although the government has suffered considerable losses as a result, it is still concerned about the unification of the national currency system. The spokesperson continued, if the Central Reserve Bank Law can complete the legislative process before the Legislative Yuan's summer vacation, the government will begin to prepare for the reorganization of the Central Bank, which should be implemented when Minister of Finance Kong returns to the country.

### There Will Be Adjustments in the Staff of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China

Commander Tashiro will be transferred back to Japan to take up another position; His vacancy is planned to be filled by Commander Okamura of the Division.

[Tianjin] The Japanese Garrison Army in North China will undergo changes in July. Many officers and staff members will be transferred. Deputy Section Chief Spenta, the staff officer of the Second Section, will return to his original position in the Kwantung Army Department. The Japanese Army Ministry's plan to strengthen the North China Garrison Army has been internally decided. Tashiro will be transferred back to Japan to take up another position. His vacancy will be filled by Ningci Okamura, the Commander of the 2nd Division in Sendai. This matter has been unanimously approved by the military headquarters. This matter was originally rumored this spring, but it was put on hold due to the military headquarters taking into account Tashiro's reputation and the dignity of the commander of the garrison army. Recently, the military headquarters does not intend to remove political obstacles in North China for us, so it feels that it is appropriate to transfer Lieutenant General Okamura to command the Japanese garrison in North China. It is heard that a clear order may be issued in mid-to-late July, and Okamura will come to China around the beginning of August to take office. (22nd Special Dispatch)

### Ambassador Kawagoe Pays His Farewell to Konoe Before Returning to His Post

He will meet with Foreign Minister Wang immediately after returning to his post; It is feared that the resumption of negotiations will still take time.

[Tokyo] Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe Shigeru, has decided to depart from Yokohama on the 25th of this month to return to his post in China. A special correspondent of the Central News Agency stationed in Tokyo visited Ambassador Kawagoe at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 pm today for an interview of about forty minutes. The impressions gained from today's conversation can be roughly summarized into the following three points: ㊀ The Japanese side has no intention of promptly proceeding with Sino-Japanese negotiations, and would rather wait for the atmosphere on the Chinese side to improve. ㊁ Under the current circumstances, it is truly difficult to raise political issues that the Chinese side hopes to resolve for discussion. ㊂ Even if diplomatic negotiations are reopened, their nature will only be to re-discuss issues that have already been negotiated before. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] Ambassador Kawagoe, who is scheduled to depart for his return on the 25th, visited Prime Minister Konoe at the Prime Minister's official residence at 3:00 pm on the 22nd to express his intention to resign before returning to his post, and then left. (22nd Allied News Dispatch)

[Tokyo] Ambassador Kawagoe, who is scheduled to depart on the Chichibu Maru on the 25th, intends to meet with Foreign Minister Wang in Nanjing immediately after returning to his post. On the other hand, Ambassador Xu Shiying, the Ambassador to Japan, who is carrying new instructions to Japan and will cross the sea to return to his post, will also confer with Ambassador Kawagoe before his departure. As soon as Ambassador Kawagoe arrives in Shanghai on the 29th, he will meet with him. This intention has been transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Chinese Embassy in Japan for consultation. Therefore, the two ambassadors can meet in Shanghai as early as the beginning of next month to exchange opinions on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. (22nd Allied News Dispatch)

[Tianjin] Secretary Tajiri revisited Horiuchi and Kiichi Kishi, the consuls, on the 22nd to listen to general diplomatic and political information in North China. In the evening, he extended his visit to Ban Ruigeng to listen to the situation of the puppet organization, and will go to Peiping on the 23rd to meet with Acting Agent Kato. (22nd Special Dispatch)

[Tianjin] Tajiri said that Kawagoe is returning to his post to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. He is collecting information from Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping to provide reference materials. Therefore, he is touring North China and meeting with consuls-general to exchange information. After Kawagoe returns, there may be major changes in the situation. (22nd Special Dispatch)

[Tokyo] This morning's editorial in the Daily News entitled "Hirota's Mission of Diplomacy towards China" stated that even if the ambassadors of both countries return to their posts and negotiations can be reopened, it is still difficult to expect to resolve the basic problems that remain unresolved between the two countries through this. If any party hastily pushes forward the issues they hope to achieve, the result will not only unnecessarily stimulate the other party, but may even be completely different from what is expected. The current situation in North China is necessary and makes it so, so Japan cannot make changes solely because of China's wishes. On the other hand, Hirota's Three Principles are, of course, basically Japan's desired policy, but under the current situation in China, it is impossible to promote its immediate realization. The report also said that Prime Minister Konoe is very concerned about the Chinese problem and may be willing to take some measures to break the deadlock between China and Japan. At the same time, Foreign Minister Hirota is also interested in the Chinese problem and will inevitably take a positive attitude, but the problem is that the wishes of China and Japan are too far apart, and it seems difficult for the Konoe Cabinet to have a rich harvest. Finally, the report expressed its hope, saying, "We would rather hope that the Konoe Cabinet will place the task of solving the Chinese problem in a relatively distant future, and only limit itself to carrying out various preparatory work. The Anglo-Japanese negotiations are an example." According to the above editorial, it contains two meanings: first, the Konoe Cabinet decided to resume Sino-Japanese negotiations after Ambassador Kawagoe returns to his post; second, when negotiations are held in the future, Japan may raise various major issues, but it cannot be hoped that they will be successful immediately. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)

Applicable to All Concessions in China

[Geneva] The International Labour Conference met today and passed by a vote of 130 a draft resolution on factory inspection in the Shanghai concessions, proposed by Zhu Xuefan, the labor representative attending the International Labour Conference from China. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

[Geneva] Today, the worker representatives of China, Japan, Belgium, and India presented a joint resolution at the International Labour Conference, advocating that workers in China, whether within Chinese territory or in concessions, should receive uniform protection. This matter sparked lively discussion. The result was 103 votes in favor and none against. The Gu representative of the Japanese employer delegation read a telegram from the United Association of Japanese Flour Mill Owners in China, stating that the treatment of workers in the concessions was actually superior to that in other parts of China. He also claimed that Chinese factories did not comply with Chinese factory laws because they were too idealistic. Yao Dingchen, the Chinese worker representative, stated that if China's industrialization continued to progress actively, and unfair conditions were allowed to persist, fair competition would be greatly disadvantaged, affecting the national economy. Bao Huaguo, the Chinese government representative, refuted the Japanese advisor's claim that wages in the concessions were 10% higher than elsewhere. The French representative stated that the French government was willing to implement appropriately progressive laws, but China must implement them uniformly elsewhere. Subsequently, the conference decided by a vote of 66 to 39 to discuss at the next meeting the universal implementation of a 40-hour work week. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 22nd)

### On the National Defense Line (11)

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent, Shu Di

Mr. Yan Xishan Answers Three Questions (Continued from the 7th of this Month)

The reporter continued to ask Mr. Yan Xishan: "The people's organizations and training on the front line of national defense are considered extremely urgent and important by people across the country. Under the leadership of the authorities, your province has shown very vigorous progress in both of these aspects in recent years. However, what is the central spirit of all the measures? I very much hope to hear Mr. Yan's aspirations." Mr. Yan thought for a moment and replied: "As you said, the people's organization and training on the front line of national defense are very urgent and important. Therefore, the current major goals of Shanxi's people's organization and training are: to arm 100,000 people and organize 1 million people within one year. As for the central spirit of various people's movements in Shanxi in recent years, it can be divided into two stages: In the past two years, because the Communist Party's Red Army frequently wanted to cross the river into Shanxi from the Shaanxi-North area, they used the poor governance of Shanxi and various social inequalities to appeal to the people. Therefore, in order to resist this incitement, we in Shanxi had to organize the people, so there were organizations such as the "Advocating Justice Corps". Its biggest purpose was to use the power of the people to eradicate social inequalities and monitor governance. The most successful work done in recent years has been the reporting and impeachment of officials. Everyone is treated equally, and even I and Chairman Zhao have been impeached. After the Suiyuan War of Resistance broke out last year, the goal of Shanxi's people's movement changed to: "Defending the homeland and resisting aggression". Therefore, in addition to continuing to intensify other efforts this year, we have also organized a "Sacrifice to Save the Nation League", whose main task is to lead the people in engaging in national salvation. This is the second stage."

The reporter asked: "I have long heard of the fame of your province's developed industry and commerce. After arriving in your province for a few days this time, I am very grateful for the convenience given by all parties in guiding the visit. The increase in foreign investment in industry in major trading ports shows the increasing crisis of our country and nation; the decline of industry and commerce on the front line of national defense shows the lack of a material basis for our national defense. However, in Shanxi, we have seen the sprouts of national industry and commerce, and the material guarantee of national defense. I feel indescribable comfort, excitement and reassurance! Then, has your province's industrial and commercial construction reached the point of self-sufficiency over these many years?"

Mr. Yan smiled very consolingly and then replied: "In this era, the matter of self-sufficiency, from my point of view, cannot be discussed not only by one province, but not even by one country. Our initial intention in Shanxi's vigorous development of industry and commerce was, of course, also to do our best to contribute to the country's prosperity and strength; however, Shanxi also has its own reasons for having to develop industry and commerce: On the one hand, agricultural products are not produced in large quantities, and mineral deposits are suitable for the development of industry. Moreover, in the past twenty years, those in Shanxi who have done business abroad, in Outer Mongolia, and in other provinces have completely failed and have had to return to Shanxi to operate; on the other hand, foreign goods are expensive, which is not something that the economic consumption power of the people of Shanxi can bear. If we do not focus on industry and commerce, the people of Shanxi may fall into complete bankruptcy, and the result will inevitably cause major social unrest. Therefore, there are very few expensive foreign goods on the market in Shanxi today; and the sales of domestic goods are still very high. Although we have organizations such as "Local Goods Stores", we do not necessarily focus solely on Shanxi's local goods. This is something that everyone should always recognize."

At this point, it had been about twenty minutes; the reporter was afraid of delaying Mr. Yan's official duties too much, so he stood up, intending to take his leave. However, Mr. Yan gestured with his hand, asking the reporter to sit down for a while longer; and turned the topic to another aspect. He said that the two claims he had just talked about, "distribution according to labor" and "property certificates", as well as the method of "increasing the budget", whether or not these can be implemented depends entirely on the joint research of all parties across the country; and he also said that what is most needed at the moment is to create a kind of "national consciousness" for it, and then there will be power.

"What is meant by 'national consciousness'?" Mr. Yan explained. "This is a term I created, meaning 'national awareness'. For example, since last year, we have already had a 'national consciousness' regarding the war of resistance, which is: whoever resists aggression, everyone supports and assists him; whoever does not resist aggression, everyone criticizes him. The creation of this kind of 'national consciousness' owes the greatest debt to the power of public opinion and the press!"

Next, Mr. Yan talked about how, although he was very busy, he still took time every day to browse the popular newspapers and periodicals, and that he paid special attention to books and newspapers that recorded the conditions of the great powers and the reasons why they had become rich and strong. In the end, he talked about this newspaper:

"Your newspaper is the oldest and largest newspaper in Chinese history, and has the greatest power in the press. More than twenty years ago, when I was studying in Japan, I liked to read it very much. Therefore, I am very willing to talk to you today when you come to see me."

At this point, the situation of the conversation had already reached a point where it could be concluded. The reporter stood up to say goodbye, apologizing for disturbing his official duties; and at the same time, he expressed his gratitude on behalf of the newspaper and the reporter personally for his earnest and detailed guidance.

When shaking hands with Mr. Yan to say goodbye, thinking about the situation on the front line of national defense, thinking about the situation in Shanxi and Suiyuan, and thinking about the current state of mind of Mr. Yan, who is in the highest authority in Shanxi and Suiyuan, one truly feels an indescribable meaning and admiration.

Current Commentary

### On Currency Unification

— Ren

The implementation of our country's new currency system is approaching two years. During this period, the promotion of the new currency system has generally been smooth. However, in the remote areas of Guangdong and Guangxi, due to past political disagreements, the legal tender's influence was insufficient. General commercial practices mostly still used their old silver coin vouchers and Guangxi currency. This fact must be said to be a huge obstacle to currency unification. However, now that the domestic political situation is tending towards unification, the national currency system should also quickly unify with the political situation to lay the foundation for China's economy. As a result of Song Ziwen's recent entry into Guangdong to reorganize finance, the Ministry of Finance announced on the 20th that the ratio of Guangdong currency to legal tender is an increase of forty-four. (The value of Guangdong currency has increased by 6% compared to the ratio set in August last year.) It was also stipulated that the national currency will be uniformly used after New Year's Day next year. The old silver coin vouchers issued in the past will be gradually withdrawn starting from the day before yesterday (21st) and will no longer be circulated. At the same time, the silver and money industry in Guangdong Province has decided to switch to using silver dollars (legal tender) for accounting starting from July 1st. As for the currency system issue in Guangxi Province, it is said that discussions are currently underway. The national currency unification will soon be seen in reality.

However, there is something that we still cannot refrain from saying. Under the current circumstances, whether China's economic future is promising depends heavily on the success or failure of the new currency system. And whether the currency system is unified is just one of the keys to the success or failure of the currency system. And this so-called unification of the currency system still focuses on substance, not appearance. Judging by the facts today, the so-called superficial currency unification, as mentioned above, will certainly be seen in reality in the near future. However, it has not yet reached substantial unification. Because today, in addition to legal tender, the banknotes of various commercial banks still flood the market. The banknotes of various provincial and municipal banks still have their unshakeable position. Furthermore, the banknotes of foreign banks also circulate in cities. Even the banknotes of the puppet Hebei Eastern Regime are used on Chinese territory. There is nothing more bizarre and grotesque than this. Therefore, in order to seek true currency unification, one cannot be satisfied with using legal tender standards for contracts and transactions. In other words, the same currency should also be used in actual circulation. This is the so-called issue of unified issuance. And this so-called unification of issuance is the true meaning of currency unification.

The government is preparing to implement this unification of issuance. In the future, after the establishment of the Central Reserve Bank, it will make the bank the sole issuing agency. Then, the so-called substantial unification of the currency system will also be seen in reality in the near future. However, this unification of issuance cannot be immediately regarded as the true success of the entire currency system. Because after the unification of issuance, we must still seek the soundness of the issuing agency, and then we can hope for the consolidation of the currency system's foundation. Today, the Central Reserve Bank Law stipulates in principle that the bank should stand in a detached position. This is to seek the soundness of the issuing agency. However, how this so-called detached position is stipulated in the law is currently unknown. (The law was initially reviewed and completed in the Legislative Yuan the day before yesterday (21st). The results were not announced.) In our opinion, this detached position must be able to achieve substantial detachment. If commercial shares are added to the reserve bank, and the president is not concurrently the Minister of Finance, then all of this is only superficial detachment. The so-called substantial detachment must achieve the following two points: (1) The amount of government bonds that the reserve bank can accept should be limited. (2) The amount of loans that the reserve bank can make to the government should be limited. The purpose is to make the bank substantially separate from the government and not be an external treasury for the government to draw from. If so, then since the currency system is unified and the issuing agency is also sound, the foundation of the currency system can be consolidated and undefeated.

### Netherlands Protests Dumping of Philippine Sugar in Hong Kong

Expression of the Philippine Officialdom

[Washington] Philippine officials here indicated today that the Philippine Autonomous Government may not be able to take action regarding the Netherlands' protest against the dumping of Philippine sugar in Hong Kong, because the Philippine Congress has not passed a resolution to participate in the London Sugar Conference. Although the Philippines has representatives attending, they were invited by the US State Department. However, Manila may informally order sugar merchants to comply with the London Agreement, pending the Congress's passage of relevant legislation at the next session. (National Telegram on the 21st)

### Kong Xiangxi and His Entourage Arrive in the United States

Sincerely Said that the Friendship Between China and the United States Has Always Been Extremely Close; Hoping for Assistance in Economic Construction

[New York] Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of our country, and his entourage arrived here today aboard the British mail ship "Queen Mary". Wang Zhengting, our ambassador to the United States, representatives from the US State Department, senior officials from our embassy in the United States, and many overseas Chinese all welcomed them at the dock. Vice President Kong then met with reporters at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and gave a speech, first saying, "I am extremely happy to be able to revisit your country this time. I will first express my gratitude to President Roosevelt, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, and the important leaders of Congress for their support of our country's currency system reform in November 1935. This reform has been proceeding smoothly and has proven to be a great success. I am deeply gratified by this." Kong continued, "The United States is my second hometown. I spent many happy years in your country studying. The last time I came to your country was five years ago, and I am very pleased to be visiting again today." Kong then spoke about China's political and economic situation, saying, "In recent years, our country has not only made achievements in political unification, but has also succeeded in financial stability. Our country underwent the most severe test last year, but has emerged victorious. At present, our country is actively promoting a five-year plan for economic construction and industrial development. This is why I was sent abroad to inspect the industrial and economic development of European and American countries after attending the coronation of the British monarch. We have been inspecting Europe for a long time and are now preparing to continue our inspection in your country, hoping to achieve good results."

In conclusion, Kong said, "The relationship between China and the United States has always been close, because the people of both countries have always respected each other. The friendship between the two countries is not only beneficial to both countries, but also a barrier to peace and stability in the Pacific region. This is the wish of our government, people, and myself. I believe that you also wish that the friendship between the two countries will last forever." Vice President Kong and his entourage are scheduled to leave here for New Haven tomorrow to attend Yale University's ceremony on Thursday and receive an honorary doctorate from the university. They will travel to Washington around the 25th, where US President Roosevelt will meet with them. At the same time, Vice President Kong will also meet with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. According to the current itinerary, Vice President Kong is scheduled to leave the United States and return to Europe on the 7th of next month, and is scheduled to take a short rest in Bad Nauheim, Germany, and have a medical examination before returning to his country.

### Yoshida Receives Instructions to Negotiate with England

Broad Scope Including the China Problem; Special Emphasis on Adjusting Trade Relations

[Tokyo] According to observations here, the Yoshida-Cadogan talks that were conducted when Sato was Foreign Minister will continue. According to a Domei News Agency dispatch from London, Japanese Ambassador to England Yoshida has received instructions from Foreign Minister Hirota to immediately hold open and formal negotiations with British Foreign Minister Eden. According to observers here, the scope of the London talks is very broad, including not only commercial issues and credit loan issues between Japan and the British Empire, but also the China problem. Some degree of understanding between the two countries on commercial issues does not seem entirely impossible, because although Japanese goods are a strong competitor to British goods in British colonies, Japan is ultimately a major consumer of raw materials produced in British colonies. Regarding credit issues, although Japan's hopes are extremely sincere, Britain's conditions are likely to be too harsh and unacceptable to Japan. As for the China problem, especially the North China problem, Britain does not seem likely to ignore the wishes of the Chinese people and compromise with Japan, so the possibility of success on this issue is the least. The basic reason why Britain has adopted an accepting attitude towards Japan's proposal to negotiate and adjust mutual relations is that Britain deeply desires to maintain peace in the Far East.

### Japanese Telegraph Reports Alleged Russian Border Dispute

[Changchun] Soviet border troops have begun operations for several days, infringing on the "Manchu" border. Namely, at 4:00 AM on the 19th, at Seinu Island, 25 kilometers upstream of the Qiqia River, 200 Soviet troops crossed the border and landed, occupied the island, and demanded the residents to evacuate. Also, at 11:00 AM on the 19th, at Bolisaibird, 50 kilometers upstream of the Qiqia River, Soviet troops landed on guard ships and forcibly evacuated Manchu coolies, some of whom were even arrested by the Soviet army.

However, the ship has not yet retreated, and the two sides are currently in a standoff. (Allied Telegraph, 22nd)

### Three Flying Heroes Arrive in San Francisco

Received Enthusiastic Welcome from the Crowd. Direct Flight between U.S. and Russia Successful. Important Stage in Conquering the Watery Ocean

Oakland, California: The three Soviet Russian aviators completed their unprecedented feat of flying from Moscow across the Arctic to the United States yesterday. More than 3,000 people in California warmly welcomed them. They had arrived here on a chartered plane from Portland, accompanied by Soviet Russian Ambassador to the United States Troyanovsky. After arriving here, the three aviators went to the Soviet Russian Consulate in San Francisco to attend a welcome banquet. The three odometers in the original aircraft will be sent to Washington in their original condition for inspection by the American Aeronautical Society. Today, according to a certain expert committee, the distance traveled in this flight is not far from the record of 5,675 miles set by French aviators Rossi and Codus in August 1933. The Ambassador stated that the three aviators will stay in the United States for a month, but their itinerary and dates have not yet been determined. According to aviation regulations, a new non-stop flight record must exceed the original record by more than 100 kilometers, and the straight-line distance between the starting and landing points is the standard, and detours cannot be calculated. Therefore, this flight will only count the straight-line distance between Moscow and Vancouver. (National Telegraph, 21st)

[Moscow] Renowned Arctic explorer Professor Schmidt recently gave a radio broadcast from Amderma in the Arctic Ocean, stating, "Chkalov (i.e., the pilot of the ANT-25) used the radio beacons installed by us on Rudolf Island in the Arctic Ocean and the radio stations established near the Arctic, and completed his flight, which proves that we have achieved quite a lot, and we are very fortunate. Moreover, Chkalov's feat is an important stage in conquering the Arctic Ocean, and a new Arctic air route will soon become a reality." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegraph, 21st)

### Neurath Postpones Visit to England, Germany's Attitude Difficult to Grasp

Demands England and France Take Effective Action Regarding Attack on German Warship in Spanish Waters

[London] German Foreign Minister Neurath, who was originally scheduled to visit here on the 23rd, has now postponed his visit to England. British officials all said that Germany has once again refused to discuss friendship, which can be seen from this. The impression felt by diplomatic circles is also extremely bad. They all believe that the future of solving various European problems has been delayed due to Neurath's postponement of his visit to England. Moreover, Germany recently showed a tendency to compromise, but now its true attitude is still impossible for people to grasp. According to the observation of the general British public, Neurath's trip is likely to be postponed indefinitely. In addition, German newspapers are making a big fuss about the attack on the German cruiser "Leipzig," and are also vigorously attacking Czechoslovakia because the German expatriate Welcher was abused by Czech police. All of this is enough to make people feel pessimistic. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegraph, 21st)

[Berlin] Diplomatic circles are rumored that Foreign Minister Neurath's postponement of his trip to England may be a prelude to Germany taking military action against the Spanish Republican government, and the significance of this action may be even greater than Germany's recent shelling of the Spanish port of Almeria. Some observers believe that the recent execution of eight senior Soviet generals and the cabinet crisis in France are all reasons for Germany to change its attitude towards Spain. Therefore, although the testimonies regarding the attack on the cruiser "Leipzig" are contradictory, Germany still refuses to investigate. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegraph, 21st)

[Berlin] According to the suggestion of influential figures here, ships performing surveillance duties in Spanish territorial waters should be severely punished immediately if they encounter any attempts at damage. The methods of severe punishment may include confiscating merchant ships, blockading ports, and holding naval demonstrations. A spokesperson told a Reuters reporter today that the previous attack on the German warship "Deutschland" has made Germans feel extremely sensitive. Furthermore, the recent attack on the "Leipzig" has also made us extremely angry, but it has not been taken seriously by the outside world, which is regrettable. We must make the communists understand that not only should serious offenders be punished, but their military position must also be weakened by effective means. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)

[London] German Foreign Minister Neurath has postponed his trip to England due to the attack on the German warship. According to an official statement from Berlin, the situation created by the repeated attacks on German warships by the Spanish Reds has now made it impossible for the German Foreign Minister to leave Berlin. Neurath originally intended to travel to London on June 23 at the invitation of the British government. People in London deeply hoped that the British government would have this opportunity to talk directly with the German Foreign Minister to discuss important international issues and achieve valuable results. Now that the trip has been suddenly postponed, people in London are greatly disappointed. Although Neurath used the severe situation in Spain as the reason for not being able to leave Berlin temporarily, everyone feels that if Neurath considers the Spanish issue to be one of the main events in his talks with the British authorities, then after this attack on the German warship, he should be even more willing to explain his views to British Foreign Secretary Eden. It seems inappropriate to postpone his trip. The question of whether the British government will continue to invite the German Foreign Minister to visit is still undecided. It must wait until there is a suitable opportunity to discuss the Spanish civil war or discuss ways to resolve the European situation before making a second invitation. However, this may not be a short-term matter. Therefore, the German Foreign Minister's trip to London can be said to have been postponed indefinitely. London originally hoped that various difficult issues could be discussed peacefully, but according to the opinion of official circles in Berlin, the current political atmosphere obviously cannot realize the expectations held by people in London. When the news of the German Foreign Minister's visit to England was first announced, German political and public opinion circles had high hopes for his visit to England. Now that the trip has been cancelled, this is especially surprising to foreign observers stationed in Berlin.

The German people were furious when they heard the news of the attack on the German warship. German newspapers continue to state the seriousness of the matter. According to a statement from the German government, after inspecting the cruiser "Leipzig," indentations and friction marks were found on the hull, which were probably caused by torpedoes or mines. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegraph, 21st)

### Four Countries Continue Discussions on German Warship Bombing Incident

British Foreign Secretary Meets with Italian, German, and French Ambassadors, Expresses Unwillingness to Participate in Naval Demonstration

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden held two meetings with the ambassadors to England from France, Germany, and Italy today regarding the attack on the German warship "Leipzig." The first was held in the House of Commons in the afternoon, and the second meeting place was in the Foreign Office, from 9:00 PM to 11:15 PM. According to a communiqué, the meetings held on June 19 and today, discussing the attack on the German warship, considered several proposals in order to determine the most appropriate way to deal with the current situation, but no practical agreement has been reached. Therefore, it was decided that the representatives of the four countries should each instruct their governments before the next meeting. It is expected that the next meeting will be held on Tuesday afternoon. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegraph, 21st)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden declared in the House of Commons today that Britain has no intention of participating in a naval demonstration in the territorial waters of the Valencia government regarding the torpedo attack on the German warship "Leipzig." Eden also expressed his opinion that the biggest reason for dissatisfaction with the situation in Spain is the participation of foreign nationals in the belligerent groups. Therefore, the British government has volunteered to the Non-Intervention Committee to promote the early withdrawal of foreign troops. Eden also said that consultations among the four countries regarding the Leipzig incident are still in progress. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)

[London] This afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Eden answered a question from a member of the House of Commons, saying that on Saturday and Sunday afternoon, the German Ambassador to England sent a note to the Foreign Office, reporting that the German cruiser "Leipzig" had narrowly escaped torpedo attacks four times, and requested the British government to find a way so that the four countries that signed the June 12th agreement could immediately take joint action. After Eden finished speaking, the Duchess of Atholl rose and asked the Foreign Secretary if he could absolutely confirm this was the fact. She meant that this matter needed to be investigated. Lloyd George then interjected, saying that this should be investigated impartially. The Spanish government's Minister of Defense has solemnly declared that all government submarines were in port at the time. Eden replied that he was well aware of this point, and thought Lloyd George could also understand his position. He had not forgotten the importance of investigation. The purpose of his meeting with those concerned was to find the best possible way to resolve the difficult situation. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegraph, 21st)

### Chairman of the Adjustment Committee Urges Cooperation from All Countries

Strictly Observe the Non-Intervention Agreement, No Further Delay for the Withdrawal of Volunteer Soldiers

[London] Lord Plymouth, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, presiding over the sub-committee of the Non-Intervention Committee today, said that although the Non-Intervention Committee has various agreements and carefully managed organizations, armaments and war materials are still being transported into Spain to supply both belligerents. The British government is greatly disappointed because it considers the current situation extremely unsatisfactory. According to the British government, if the Non-Intervention Committee has a reason to exist, and its previous efforts are not to be in vain, then the current situation must not be allowed to continue. Governments of all countries should actively work within their own borders to ensure that the obligations of the non-intervention treaty are strictly observed by all parties. If there is no immediate evidence of such cooperation, the British government will inevitably take note of this fact when it reconsiders the situation. There are now a large number of foreign troops in Spain, which is a very unsatisfactory phenomenon in the situation. The British government sincerely hopes that all countries will, at the earliest possible time, begin to implement practical and effective methods to gradually withdraw foreign personnel from Spain. The representatives attending the meeting immediately agreed to each ask their governments to submit their opinions as soon as possible, explaining their views on the withdrawal of foreign personnel from Spain.

### German Foreign Minister Visits Hitler

Reviews Policy Towards Spain

[Berlin] Political circles here are paying extraordinary attention to the attack on the German cruiser "Leipzig." Foreign Minister Neurath visited Chancellor Hitler this afternoon for a long talk. Well-informed sources expect that the outcome of the talks will determine Germany's attitude towards the Non-Intervention Committee. It is also generally believed that these talks may also determine whether Germany will take unilateral action to eliminate the dangers it has encountered twice. It is said that although Germany has a desire to cooperate in any effective international action, it must also protect its own interests. The failure of various countries to correctly understand Germany's environment, especially the comments in London newspapers after German Foreign Minister Neurath postponed his visit to England, is a clear indication of this misunderstanding, which political circles here deeply regret.

### Spanish Government Denies Attacking German Warship

Requests British Investigation into the Truth

[London] The Spanish government has recently sent a note to Britain, denying that Spanish government warships had launched torpedoes to bombard the French cruiser "Leipzig" on June 15 and 18, and is willing to give the British government all kinds of facilities to begin investigating the facts stated by Germany.

### Spanish Rebel Forces Advance Victoriously, Santander Situation Critical

150,000 Residents Evacuated from Bilbao, Basque Autonomous Region Still Exists

Bayonne: The Nationalist forces are now continuing to advance east and southeast of Bilbao. The Nationalist forces have occupied Portugalete and Amorebieta, and are now guarding the railway between San Sebastian, Bilbao, and Burgos. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegraph, 21st)

Madrid: The authorities here claim that the situation in Santander is currently extremely urgent, as the city is already crowded with refugees. The government's diplomatic representatives have requested the British and French governments to send warships to Santander to protect ships transporting refugees. (National Maritime Telegraph, 22nd)

Madrid: The Spanish government issued a lengthy declaration today, informing the entire nation that Bilbao had been captured by the Nationalist forces, stating that as many as 150,000 residents of Bilbao had withdrawn, preferring to abandon their homes rather than live under the enemy. Therefore, the Basque Autonomous Region still exists. The declaration strongly criticizes the farcical method of maritime surveillance, saying that its sole purpose is to allow foreign fascists to freely transport foreign troops and armaments into Spain. It also said that although the situation in the Basque region is not good, the Spanish government is not pessimistic about the final outcome of this war. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegraph, 21st)

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden answered a question from a member of the House of Commons today, saying that he had reliable reasons to believe that the aircraft recently used by the Spanish Nationalist forces to attack Bilbao included three types of aircraft: bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, and fighters. According to the information he obtained, these three types of aircraft were produced by German and Italian factories. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegraph, 21st)

### Loss of Control on the Jaime I Causes Over Three Hundred Casualties

Gibraltar: The Spanish government warship Jaime I suffered an explosion on board due to loss of control on June 16. At the time, it was reported that a total of 18 people died and 100 were injured. The Valencia government now admits that the ship was damaged more severely than previously reported. According to reliable sources here, a total of 176 people died and 200 were injured. The ship was undergoing repairs at the port of Cartagena when the explosion occurred. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegraph, 21st)

Tokyo Correspondence

### Talking About the Konoe Cabinet (Part 2)

— Nagumo

The essence of the Konoe Cabinet remains nothing more than representing financial capital and strengthening the rule of monopoly capital. However, because the internal contradictions between various strata of capitalists cannot be resolved, and the economic and political struggles of the proletariat are intensifying, it is necessary to coordinate the contradictions between the various capitalist strata in order to suppress the struggles of the masses. This is in the interest of all capitalist strata, but it is still most beneficial to the monopoly capital stratum. And there is also a contradictory side within the monopoly capital stratum, such as the Mitsui and Mitsubishi systems. Therefore, the form in which the Konoe Cabinet appears cannot but be to coordinate the various ruling strata, and at the same time, the various ruling strata have to express their support for Konoe in name. But this is also the reason why Konoe cannot get the most active support from all sides. Now all factions are willing to support him on stage, only because there is no political force among the current factions that is sufficient to rule all factions. If Konoe wants to further strengthen his political position, he must show even more of a fascistization.

At present, the way out for the Japanese ruling class is only to further strengthen the rule and actively "fascistize." The recent "coups" only illustrate the initial contradictions on the path of "fascistization." These contradictions can be temporarily coordinated with stronger control.

In the newspaper correspondence (Japanese Coup Theory) on December 12th of last year, the author said: "The successor to the Hirota Cabinet that the military hopes for is a banker like Baba. The so-called Director-General of the Planning Board is in fact the Deputy Prime Minister. He has the responsibility of promoting the Prime Minister to establish innovative policies, and at the same time, he has the power to urge the Minister of Finance to build a "revolutionary finance." The Planning Board is the most important institution of the Cabinet, and it is closely related to the annual budget examination. With the Planning Board, the powers of the Minister of Finance are weakened a lot.

However, in the process of this Konoe cabinet formation, the position of Minister of Finance has obviously become the target of competition among various factions.

The military strongly advocated that Baba concurrently serve as Director-General of the Planning Board. This shows that the military trusts bankers of Baba's type very much.

The financial claims of the new Minister of Finance, Kaya Okinori, are very different from Baba's. In the past, when Baba was the Minister of Finance, he demoted Kaya from the Budget and Settlement Division to the Financial Bureau. When Yūki was in office, he continued to promote his high position and made him Vice-Minister of Finance. Now, it is obviously impossible to combine him and Baba in the close relationship between the Planning Board and the Ministry of Finance.

Baba has the military as a backer, and Kaya also has the financial world as a pillar. (In fact, there are also the shadows of emerging munitions industrialists behind Baba). In the new cabinet, Kaya also has a comrade-in-arms—this is Minister of Commerce and Industry Yoshino Shinji. Yoshino expressed his support for Kaya's financial policy. The fundamental policy of Kaya's "financial and economic policy" is based on "adjusting the balance of international payments" as the keynote of the entire policy. This is:

"Under the premise of promoting exports, to establish a 'Japan-Manchukuo' integrated industrial plan, and to handle issues such as national defense budget formulation, production capacity expansion, and price countermeasures, and investment control based on adjusting resource imports as the main body." (June 5, Asahi)

### Radical Socialist Party Leader Chautemps Proceeds with Cabinet Formation

Declares Resolution to Inherit Previous Cabinet's Policies, Socialist Party and Communist Party Express Support

[Paris] Although various political parties are still discussing whether to support Chautemps' new cabinet, Chautemps is very optimistic this morning and has declared to a New Voice reporter that the list of cabinet members can be announced around tonight. It is said that Chautemps' new cabinet list can be submitted to President Lebrun at noon today. The content of the list will not differ greatly from the Blum cabinet. It is heard that the Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, has the highest voice for the post of Minister of Finance. As for the political parties, so far, the Socialist Party members have clearly decided to support Chautemps' new cabinet. The party has also agreed to participate in the new cabinet, but there has been no concrete decision so far. Furthermore, Blum has agreed to assist the new Prime Minister in a personal capacity, and the Communist Party will probably also support him. It is said that the new Prime Minister's policy will continue the administrative policy of the previous cabinet, but will change its management agency. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)

[Paris] One of the leaders of the Radical Socialist Party, namely Chautemps, the former minister without portfolio, after being ordered to try to form a new cabinet, has now temporarily suspended the consultation process because the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party is scheduled to meet tomorrow to decide whether the party can participate in the new cabinet, in order to wait for the Socialist Party to take a final decision. Chautemps declared that he has invited the Socialist Party to continue to participate in the government, and has been allowed by former Prime Minister Blum, who said that he should firmly persuade Socialist Party members to hold several cabinet seats, but everything should be finally decided at the party's National Executive Committee meeting in Paris tomorrow. In addition, Chautemps also declared to the press that he decided to organize a government similar to the previous government, but it must be able to unite left-wing members in both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to create a majority. As for the Communist Party, it has stated that if the new cabinet's platform is based on the principles jointly formulated by the parties of the Popular Front during the general election in May of last year, the Communist Party is prepared to support it. It is now generally believed that Blum himself will probably refuse to participate in the new ___________ again taking the position of president of the ___________, as for the Ministry of Finance ___________ will be represented by Ambassador to the United States Bonnet. Bonnet is a member of the Chamber of Deputies of the Radical Socialist Party. He has previously served as Minister of Finance and Minister of Commerce. He is a famous economist. Although he is assigned to the United States, it is of a temporary nature and his mission will soon be completed. Therefore, he will be able to return to the country and re-enter the cabinet in the near future. In addition, Foreign Minister Delbos and Interior Minister Dormoy will probably all be reappointed.

### Anonymous British Donor Funds Government with Huge Sum

To Strengthen Imperial Unity

[London] It was learned today that after the abdication turmoil, an anonymous person gave former Prime Minister Baldwin 250,000 English pounds to fund any undertaking that could strengthen the unity between Britain and the self-governing colonies. Baldwin has used this sum as a new imperial fund, managed by an independent board of trustees. The trustees have the right to use the income from this fund to fund any undertaking that benefits imperial relations. The donor of this huge sum thanked Baldwin for his perseverance, vision, and compassion in handling the extremely difficult situation, which allowed the Empire to avoid danger. Therefore, he provided this sum to express his gratitude, and he hopes that India can also benefit from this aid. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)

### Mr. Shen Junru and Others' Second Defense Statement Supplementing Political Opinions

Previous defense presented, not detailed enough, a supplement to provide for reference.

The case of Shen Junru and others is now scheduled for a second hearing at the Suzhou High Court at 9:00 AM on the 25th of this month. The defendants, Shen Junru and six others, submitted their second defense statement to the court yesterday (the first defense statement has already been reported in the newspaper), supplementing their political opinions. The full text is excerpted below:

Defendants Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, and Shi Liang, supplementing political opinions, respectfully request review. The case in which the defendants are accused of endangering the Republic of China involves political issues. Therefore, the defendants' views and propositions on politics should naturally be noted during the trial. However, in the previous defense statement, because it was necessary to respond to the indictment point by point, it was not possible to make a coherent narrative on this point. Now, we respectfully submit this supplement for reference.

Concentrate Anti-Japanese Forces, Liberate the People's Movement

The National Salvation Association was founded at the end of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935]. The North China problem was extremely serious, and the separatist movement was imminent. Therefore, the central proposition at that time was "to stop the separatist movement and unify the national front," with anti-Japanese resistance as the highest goal. The slogan "to promote a unified anti-enemy regime" came from this demand, aiming to concentrate anti-Japanese forces under the leadership of the central government, with absolutely no intention of reorganizing the government. This is very clear. Even judging by common sense, the defendants, as people who advocate ceasing internal strife to resist foreign aggression, how could they bear to advocate reorganizing the government, thereby increasing internal strife, consuming national strength, and trapping themselves in contradiction? Secondly, the significance of propositions such as "stop the civil war" and "cooperation between all parties and classes in the country" also lies in preserving anti-Japanese forces and concentrating them under the leadership of the government. In short, almost everything is based on anti-Japanese resistance. Furthermore, if we advocate opening up speech to stimulate the anti-Japanese emotions of the people, liberating the people's movement to organize the people's anti-Japanese forces, and improving people's livelihoods to cultivate the people's anti-Japanese forces, it is because our country is still lingering in the agricultural era in terms of economy, and the people have not been organized into various sectors of the national economy. In peacetime, their understanding of the country is not deep enough, and in wartime, they cannot implement national mobilization through industrial mobilization. Therefore, we believe that to achieve the goal of national war, it is impossible to succeed without extremely arduous enlightenment and organizational work beforehand. We will not talk about anti-Japanese preparation if we do not mention it. If we talk about anti-Japanese preparation, this is the most basic preparation item.

The Current Government's Policies are Exactly What the National Salvation Association Demanded

As for why we simultaneously support rapid and effective preparation and request immediate resistance when the enemy comes, it is because resistance is the purpose of preparation and also a prerequisite for preparation. If there is no determination to resist immediately when the enemy comes, then retreating day by day would make it impossible to formulate a national defense plan. In addition, if we advocate uniting with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to form a national defense anti-aggression front, its purpose is to enhance anti-Japanese forces, which is even more obvious. In short, since we regard anti-Japanese resistance as the highest goal, all propositions are merely means to achieve this goal, and the application of all propositions must never run counter to this goal. It has been heard that some people believe that the meaning of the phrase "stop the civil war" is too broad and easily abused. Their mistake lies in interpreting it out of context, away from the goal of anti-Japanese resistance. Since the motive for advocating stopping the civil war is purely to lament the consumption of anti-Japanese forces, no party in the country can use this as a talisman to launch actions that would hinder anti-Japanese resistance. If the government were to suppress the military forces that willingly serve as the enemy's pawns, it would be something we would heartily pray for. In summary, it is believed that the government has its own difficulties due to environmental constraints, while the people are deeply concerned about the country and cannot help but make urgent appeals. The defendants, holding positions of leadership, are frank in nature, but their sincerity has not been trusted, causing the government to worry and issue arrest orders. Thinking about this now, we feel deeply regretful. Since our arrest, seven months have passed in an instant, during which the recovery of Bailingmiao, the peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident, and the unprecedented achievements of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang have demonstrated to the world the government's determination to resist foreign aggression. The current government's policies at home and abroad are largely what the National Salvation Association has been seeking. The only difference is at most in the degree of urgency and importance.

Willing to Accept Government Leadership, Request Declaration of Innocence

The way to serve the country lies in grasping the common ground and tolerating minor differences. The government has the final decision-making power, while the people have the duty to promote and urge. In this sense, the defendants firmly believe that the shortcomings of the National Salvation Association's past activities lie only in failing to eliminate estrangement and by no means in having any incompatibility with the government's national policies. The National Salvation Association's future activities and the government's measures will further demonstrate their mutually reinforcing beauty and will never be contradictory. Holding this belief, the defendants are even more willing to serve the anti-Japanese cause and save the country under the leadership of the government. If we are not enlightened and are convicted, we fear that it will be detrimental to the nation and also damaging to the government. Since the defendants have dedicated themselves to the country, personal interests are not a concern. According to what the defendants know, the recent activities of the National Salvation Association adhere to the consistent principle of taking the overall situation into account and deeply grasp the new situation at this stage. The sincere request to the government for leadership has been repeatedly expressed in published documents. Even regarding the National Assembly and the Constitution, in the past, due to the fact that national policies had not yet been displayed, there were criticisms that the country could not even be protected, and all these should be planned later. Now that the foundation for resisting aggression and saving the country has been laid, the views on these issues have also changed drastically. Regarding the election law of the National Assembly, in the past, because the elected representatives had to be selected through roundabout means, it was considered to have lost the original intention of promoting democracy. Now that the bill has been revised, the basis for criticism is also completely different from the past. The National Salvation Association's recent attention to the constitutional movement further proves that its past criticisms were all to express the "anti-Japanese first" principle and that there were no prejudices mixed in. The defendants believe that under these circumstances, as long as the government provides appropriate guidance, the National Salvation Association can further become a civilian force that supports the government in consolidating democratic unity, promoting national economic construction, and completing anti-Japanese preparation. The North China crisis is still urgent, and the enemy and puppets are waiting for an opportunity to act, no less than in the previous year. The defendants are in prison, extremely worried, and have been seeking ways to serve the country day and night. Therefore, we respectfully supplement our opinions and ask your court to consider the current situation, declare the defendants innocent, further clarify the government's national policies, and increase the unity of the nation, which the country's future relies on.

### Japanese Xingzhong Corporation's Shantou Aoyama Case Heading Towards Reconciliation

Japanese Consul General met with the Mayor of Shantou twice without result. The situation eased only after the two warships left Shantou. Japanese businesses affected suspended operations awaiting revival.

Shantou correspondence: Since the Aoyama Seiichi case occurred, almost a month has passed. Negotiations have been held 15 times in Shantou and Guangzhou. Because the Japanese side made various unreasonable arguments in Shantou, the opinions of both sides could not be approached. Later, in Guangzhou, Mr. Diao Zuqian negotiated with Nakamura, but the stalemate could not be broken. It was decided to reconcile on the spot in Shantou, first seeking common ground, such as several items that both sides agreed on, and several items that disagreed on, clearly analyzed, and then transferred to the province for handling. Therefore, the resident Japanese consul general in Shantou visited Mayor Huang again on the 11th, requesting a review of the second and third floors of the Shenzhou Foreign Firm, on the pretext of clarifying whether the incident occurred indoors or outdoors, in order to determine the responsibility of the case. At that time, Mayor Huang replied that this matter had already been investigated and did not need to be done again, creating unnecessary complications. On the 12th, the consul general again asked Mayor Huang to summon the police officers Shang Wenzhi, Lai Yunzhong, and Huang Sheng, who were beaten that day, for a public interrogation. Mayor Huang expressed that the police were performing their duties of maintaining law and order, and the Chinese government had its own rewards and punishments for their behavior, without the need for others to intervene. If it was necessary to publicly try the people in the case, Aoyama Seiichi would also have to appear in court to confront each other, with the municipal government as the subject of the interrogation. If the Japanese side had any opinions, it had to be conveyed to the Chinese officials presiding over the interrogation. At that time, the Japanese consul general did not express sympathy, and the majority opinion on our side also believed that the Japanese consul general should not be allowed to participate in the interrogation of Chinese police officers. Therefore, negotiations broke down on the 13th again. It was heard that in Guangzhou, the Japanese Consul General Nakamura had asked Mr. Diao Zuqian to request a meeting with Chairman Wu. Mr. Diao said that if the Japanese side had the sincerity to reconcile, a meeting could be scheduled, but the Japanese warships docked in Shantou should be withdrawn first to show sincerity, and there must be concrete measures first, so that the meeting would not waste time and be fruitless. The Japanese side almost knew that the threat was ineffective, so it telegraphed Taiwan to discuss the withdrawal of the Yubari and Sanae warships stationed in Shantou. On the 15th, Admiral Kuma Seikichi ordered the two warships to leave Shantou, and the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou eased. On the 16th, the Japanese Consul General Nakamura stationed in Guangzhou went to see Chairman Wu. The talks began at 9:00 AM. It was heard that the responsibility issue was initially discussed. Nakamura still insisted on the three demands made by the Japanese side in Shantou. Chairman Wu also debated one by one based on the investigation report of the Shantou Municipal Government. Nakamura finally ran out of arguments and expressed that he would ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions and then come back to discuss after receiving instructions. He withdrew until the 11th. General observation is that this case may be resolved in a political way. Because if this case is delayed for another day, the Japanese business operations in Chaozhou and Shantou will be hit for another day. Since this spring, more than 40 Japanese trading companies have suspended operations, waiting for an opportunity to revive. Only the surface has not closed down. If it is delayed further, it will inevitably close down completely. As for the trafficking of smuggled goods, it will be even more impossible to operate. (18th)

Text:

Tianjin correspondence: The Japanese Xingzhong Corporation established a salt affairs office in Tianjin in April of this year, specializing in the export of Lu salt and seeking opportunities for development in the Changlu salt area. Nearly two months ago, the office specifically established a loan division in Seshang Village, the area with the richest Lu salt beach production in Hangu, named Tongji Money and Grain Office, with a capital of 500,000 Japanese yen, specifically inducing the various beach owners in Hangu Lu salt to borrow money from the office. The loan procedure is to first send a letter to the office, and the office will send someone to investigate and then order the salt beach or salt production as collateral to grant the loan in cash and pay interest upon repayment. This move is intended to, taking advantage of the situation that the annual production of various beaches and stoves in Changlu is sluggish and the economy is exhausted, slightly provide small sums of money, and then seize the rights of their beaches and stove households, as a line for them to gain a foothold in the Changlu salt area and seize our North China salt production in the future. Fortunately, the various beach owners have seen through their treachery, and because the Ministry of Finance previously had a clear order that anyone who uses salt production or beach land as collateral to borrow money from foreign parties must first obtain certification from the Beach Industry Association and submit it to the Salt Affairs Administration for transfer to the Ministry for verification and approval before being allowed to proceed. If they dispose of it without authorization, they will be punished for violating laws and regulations. Therefore, since February, no one has borrowed a penny from the Tongji Money and Grain Office. The salt affairs office is trying to solicit business. On the one hand, it is doing its best to persuade the various beach owners to borrow money. On the other hand, it is changing the loan procedures. If there are borrowers, it does not ask for any collateral, only an investigation and clear understanding, and then a contract can be signed. In addition, to eliminate the doubts of the various beach owners, Shao Jingyin, who is currently the manager of Lufeng Store and handles the export of Lu salt, was specifically invited to serve as the chairman of the Money and Grain Office. Zhongshan, the head of the Xingzhong Salt Affairs Office, has personally contacted Shao several times for this purpose, but Shao has politely refused. Zhongshan is looking for a responsible person, hoping to develop into the Lu salt production area through this channel. Continuing this unremittingly, it is feared that it will eventually succeed. The 80,000 mu of abandoned salt beaches in Changlu Xinhe, Denggu, and Hangu were previously introduced by the fake Jidong government to be sold to the Xingzhong Corporation in the name of the traitor Shao for use in improving salt beaches, a small part of which was purchased by the Dongyang Paper Company for planting reeds to supply paper-making raw materials. This matter was completed nearly two months ago. The Dongyang Paper Company has also purchased several thousand mu of vacant land, salt farms, and open space in Jinnan Yangzhuang Guazhong Qi Beiyang Yarn Factory and south of the Haihe River from the traitor Shao in the name of the Changlu Nantuo Land Company. The two sides have secretly agreed on a contract, in the name of perpetuity, owned by the Dongyang Paper Company. Last week, the company had already sent workers to drive piles and enclose land in the salt farm to build a constant wall. The Nantuo Land Company specifically requested the Changlu Salt Affairs Administration to transfer the request to the Ministry of Finance for negotiation and prevention. Regarding this year's export of Lu salt, the Japanese side hopes for 230,000 tons, but the first batch of contracts was signed for 100,000 tons, and the second batch of contracts has not yet been signed. The Xingzhong Corporation has urged the Changlu salt affairs authorities many times, only because it concerns people's food and the price of salt in North China has soared again, the person in charge is quite unwilling to sell it again. The stove owners of various beaches in Changlu also do not expect to sign contracts again because they have lost money in previous sales of salt. It has now been agreed by all parties that if Xingzhong still has to purchase, it should ㊀ wait until the salt production after autumn is more abundant and there is a surplus before selling it, and then continue to sign the contract at that time, ㊁ If the price of salt is too low, if it is purchased again, the price must be appropriately increased. Therefore, this year's export of Lu salt will not be allowed to be demanded by the Japanese side. (20th)

### Tragic Boiler Explosion on Passenger Steamer to Yuecheng, Guangzhou

Excessive steam pressure caused the boiler to explode, killing ten and injuring more than ten.

Guangzhou correspondence: Yuecheng in the western part of Guangdong Province has always had a Dragon Mother Temple. Every year on the Dragon Mother's birthday on the eighth day of the fifth lunar month, ignorant men and women go there to offer incense. Ferries from Zhongshan, Siyi, Jiangmen, Foshan, and Guangzhou all specially operate special services to Yuecheng. The impact is such that the shipping and paper industries are all three times more profitable, especially the shipping industry. Local authorities, in order to combine prohibition and levy, strictly ban the overloading of passenger ships carrying incense pilgrims and levy a separate ship donation on ships going to Yuecheng. Taking Jiangmen as an example, each time the ship donation collected (for only a few days) reaches three to four thousand yuan. Shipping companies in Guangzhou have also added six or seven ferries specifically running between Guangzhou and Yuecheng. From this, it can be seen how prosperous the incense pilgrims are. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 14th of this month, the incense-carrying ship suddenly experienced a boiler explosion, resulting in a tragic accident that killed and injured more than 20 people.

It turned out that the Xinrong Guang steamship, at 2:00 AM on the 13th, towed four civilian boats and two storied boats with a total of three to four hundred pilgrims. After departing from Guangzhou, when it sailed to the Jiangmian River in Hecheng Township, Nanhai County, the Xinrong Guang's boiler suddenly exploded due to excessive heat, and the sound shook the area. The iron plates of the boiler flew everywhere, killing nine crew members, cooks, and boat owners on board on the spot, and injuring seventeen or eighteen passengers in the cabin. When the tragedy occurred, the towed civilian boats and storied boats all stopped and lost their traction, drifting with the current. At this time, another boat, Yaoming, arrived and, seeing the Xinrong Guang's accident, rushed close and rescued ten of the injured and seven survivors, sending the seriously injured to the nearby Jiujiang Town Hospital for treatment. Before long, the Xinrong Guang gradually filled with water due to the damage to the bottom of the boat, and after about an hour, it sank into the water, only exposing the smokestack. As for the bodies of those killed in the explosion, they also sank with the ship. At noon, they had not yet surfaced. Subsequent investigation revealed that the dead included Xinrong Guang crew members Liang Gen, Li Run, Li Jin, Chen Lian, Liang Bai, Liang Lin, and three other passengers. The injured included boat owner Huang Jin and more than ten cooks and drivers. Stoker Tan Wang was on his last breath. In addition, two slightly injured people have been transported back to Guangzhou for hospitalization. (June 15)

Youth Commits Suicide by Lying on the Tracks

The internal staff expressed dissatisfaction with the new service regulations set by Jiang, refused to cooperate, prevented the hanging of the signboard for business, and refused pawn customers to bring items for pawn. At the same time, they appealed to the party and government agencies for relief. Jiang also accused the staff of using violence and coercion to prevent the pawnshop from operating and refused to open any further negotiations with the staff. On the 22nd, he appealed to the county government party headquarters and the pawn industry association for legal protection. Currently, both sides are still at a standstill, with no solution.

Dry Cocoon Market Price Soars

This year's spring cocoon market has ended. After the various silk factories have collected the fresh cocoons and baked them into dry cocoons, they are transported to Wuxi for silk reeling. As of yesterday, the total number of large and small silk factories starting their machines in the county has reached 40, with approximately 5,000 silk reeling machines and more than 50,000 workers. However, due to the weather in Zhejiang being humid, the yield of fresh cocoons in Zhejiang has been reduced by 20-30%. Although the silkworms in various counties in the province have also been affected by the weather, the yield has not been greatly reduced compared with previous years due to the excellent quality of the silkworm seeds and the improvement of silkworm rearing techniques and hygiene. It is found that last year's spring dry cocoon output was 50,000 market loads, while this year's is 45,000 market loads, a difference of 5,000 market loads compared with last year. However, this year, French merchants are raising prices to compete for the purchase of dry cocoons, causing the market price to soar. In the most recent week and a half, it has risen from 170 yuan to 185 yuan. Observing the situation, there is still a heat to continue rising.

It is expected that it will be completed and opened to traffic in early July.

### Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, Thoroughly Investigated Yarn Exchange Accounts Yesterday Morning

Central Government Departments and Courts Sent Personnel to Supervise; Resolutely Punish Those Who Manipulate and Speculate

After the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange turmoil subsided, Deputy Minister Cheng Tiangu returned to Nanjing to report on his mission. Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, attached great importance to this turmoil. In order to thoroughly investigate the manipulation and severely punish the perpetrators, he came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. Together with the commissioners sent by various central government departments and offices, he personally went to the Exchange on Avenue Edward VII to individually question the responsible persons and all brokers, and thoroughly examined the transaction accounts. He did not leave the Exchange until 4:00 PM. He will continue the investigation today and will review all the accounts. The details are as follows:

Wu, Minister of Industry, Arrived in Shanghai to Jointly Investigate

Due to the manipulation by speculators, the yarn and cloth exchange experienced a serious turmoil due to soaring yarn prices. The Ministry of Industry, as the highest competent authority, dispatched Vice Minister Cheng Tiangu to Shanghai to investigate. After Cheng's initial investigation in Shanghai and his efforts to persuade the parties, both buyers and sellers reached an understanding and made concessions, and the turmoil subsided. Cheng has already returned to Nanjing to report on his mission. Minister Wu Dingchang, in order to curb speculative transactions, safeguard the commodity market for morning workers, and stabilize social finance, took the Capital Express train from Nanjing the night before and arrived here yesterday morning. After a brief rest, at 7:30 AM, he, together with Yan Zhuang, a member of the Supervisory Yuan, Zhang Youlun, a counselor, Cen Dechang, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, and Yan Shenyu, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry, went to the Yarn and Cloth Exchange on Avenue Edward VII to conduct a thorough investigation. The security was quite tight.

Individual Interviews to Inquire About the Truth

After Minister Wu and his party arrived at the Exchange, they were received by Mu Ouchu, the assistant chairman of the Exchange, and Wen Lanting, a standing director, and taken to the board of directors' office for a rest. First, Minister Wu, Commissioner Yan, and others summoned Wang Xiaolai and Yu Kaizhan, supervisors of the Exchange, as well as Mu Ouchu, Wen Lanting, Shao Wenmei, chairman of the brokers' association, and Zhou Shaokang, to inquire about the causes and course of the yarn crisis. Wang, Mu, and Wen each gave a detailed account of the situation. Then, Shao and Zhou, the two chairmen, reported on the recent transaction situation of the brokers. They did not leave until noon. Immediately afterwards, more than 60 brokers, both buyers and sellers, were interviewed individually, and the transaction lists and account books of forward and spot customers for each month before and after the yarn crisis were examined. They did not finish until 4:00 PM. Wu and Yan then left the Exchange one after another.

Continuing to Investigate Accounts Today

The central government departments and the officers investigating the yarn crisis believed that the transaction accounts of all brokers and customers were of great importance and needed to be thoroughly reviewed. After the individual interviews yesterday, a general understanding of the situation was gained. Minister Wu and his party have decided to go to the Yarn and Cloth Exchange today to continue the investigation. They will review all the account books of more than 60 brokers and their entrusted customers for the past month. In advance, the brokers' association has compiled the futures transaction accounts for the four, five, six, and seven months and the two, three, four, and five months and submitted them to Wang, the accounting section chief of the Ministry of Industry, who forwarded them to Minister Wu and Commissioner Yan for review.

Yan and Zhang Expressed Their Determination to Investigate According to Law

According to Commissioner Yan of the Supervisory Yuan and Counselor Zhang, the main purpose of the joint dispatch of personnel by the central government departments to investigate the yarn crisis is to severely punish the illegal transactions of speculators. Other legitimate traders will be protected equally. However, the accounting procedures are quite complicated and will take two or three days to complete. After inquiring with the parties concerned, it has been discovered that some brokers have manipulated the market and engaged in illegal transactions, and clues have been obtained. After a detailed review of the accounts, the truth can be fully clarified, and a fair and impartial spirit will be upheld to severely punish them in accordance with the law, so as to serve as a warning to others and maintain the commerce.

The Yarn and Flower Market Plunged Yesterday

The yarn and cloth exchange market opened eight times yesterday, both in the morning and afternoon. The closing price of the fourth session in the morning was 272.3 yuan for June, 275 yuan for July, 278.8 yuan for August, and 276.2 yuan for September. The closing price of the fourth session in the afternoon was 267 yuan for June, 270 yuan for July, 272.7 yuan for August, and 275.3 yuan for September. Compared with the previous day's market, it plunged again. Compared with the market on June 11, when the June contract was 290 yuan, the difference was as much as 17.7 yuan.

Forty-Two Companies Suspended Business for Three Days

Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang came to Shanghai to investigate the yarn exchange turmoil and ordered all brokers to personally present their account books for review yesterday. However, some brokers did not show up yesterday. The Ministry of Industry specially ordered the board of directors of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange to impose a three-day suspension of business. The original order stated: "To inform the affairs that this Ministry's telegram of the 21st stated that when the Minister personally visits the Exchange on the morning of the 22nd, all brokers should personally present their account books and receipts for easy inquiry. However, when the Minister visited the Exchange today, some brokers did not show up and sent agents or representatives instead, which is a disregard of the law. All the following brokers who did not show up are hereby subject to a three-day suspension of business from the 24th of this month in accordance with Article 42 of the Exchange Law. The chairman of the board of directors is hereby ordered to notify all brokers and announce to the market for strict implementation, without violation. This order is directed to the following 42 brokers: Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 63, 66, and 68."

### The Health Bureau Organizes the 16th Health Campaign

Jointly Establish a Preparatory Committee with Various Agencies; Formulate Implementation Plans and Promote Them Effectively

The Shanghai Municipal Health Campaign has reached its 16th session. The arousal of health awareness, the guidance of healthy behavior, and the prevention of infectious diseases cannot be achieved without widespread publicity, and cannot be deeply rooted in the people without promoting the campaign. Therefore, the Health Bureau organizes a health campaign every summer. It is not only organized by the bureau alone, but also jointly organized with the assistance of various agencies in the city. This is because it feels the importance of the significance and has evolved into a routine task. Now, the bureau has been ordered to continue to organize the campaign and has already organized the Preparatory Committee for the 16th Shanghai Municipal Health Campaign to actively prepare. It was originally scheduled to be held on June 25, but July 7 is the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government, so it was rescheduled to open on July 6 and end on July 18. Therefore, the purpose of this health campaign is to arouse public attention to health and to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Municipal Government. The work is roughly divided into four aspects: publicity, epidemic prevention, inspection, and training. In terms of publicity, the motorcade health parade is the central activity. The parade route starts from the city center and passes through the entire city. The health exhibition will be held in conjunction with the large-scale health exhibition held by the bureau at the Municipal Health Experimental Institute in the city center on July 7 to avoid duplication. As for the infant health competition, it will be omitted in this session because the Chinese Health Education Society selected "Shanghai Children" in May. The Preparatory Committee charter and implementation plan have also been formulated to ensure the progress.

### Chamber of Commerce Notice: Documents Should be Primarily in Chinese

And Foreign Merchants Should Affix Stamp Duty

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to various trade associations stating, "Dear Sirs, This Chamber convened the 8th General Assembly of Members on June 19. According to the proposal submitted by the Iron Can Manufacturing Trade Association, it is proposed that all invoices used in trade with foreign merchants should be affixed with stamp duty in accordance with the regulations, and that the clause commonly used in trade, 'In case of doubt, the English text shall prevail,' should be deleted and replaced with 'The Chinese text shall prevail,' in order to maintain the principle of equality. The proposal stated that Shanghai is a major trading port and our government is bound by the regulations of the foreign concessions. Foreign merchants take advantage of the weakness of our government's lack of extraterritorial jurisdiction and treat the laws with contempt, which has become a habit. They have never known what it means to affix stamp duty to all invoices in trade with Chinese merchants, which is sufficient to hinder the prestige of our government and affect the tax revenue of our country. Our Chinese merchants should, as masters of the country, jointly devise countermeasures to make them comply. If there are documents containing legal acts and invoices for collecting payments, they must be ordered to affix the stamps in accordance with the regulations. If they do not comply, we should threaten not to trade with them. The other party will definitely not want to give up the transaction in their wishes due to minor burdens, and they will inevitably yield to the facts and comply. If our merchants can implement this unanimously, it will become a habit over time. Even if their consular officials want to oppose it, it will be impossible. Living in a country should comply with the administrative laws and regulations of that country. This is the common practice of independent countries in the world and the duty that expatriates in other civilized countries should abide by. If our people can help the government promote this, it will definitely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Please notify the various trade associations to inform all merchants and firms to comply, and victory can be assured. This can also save the government from the trouble of resolving it through diplomatic means. Furthermore, the clauses listed in Chinese-foreign contracts (such as the clauses listed in insurance policies) often contain the phrase 'In case of doubt, the English text shall prevail.' Our merchants do not realize this and regard it as commonplace. Once an incident occurs, they can distort the clauses, and they can reverse the outcome and win in litigation. Those who are harmed by this are too numerous to mention. In order to learn from the past, please notify the merchants who have trade relations with foreign merchants to pay attention to this. If there are unreasonable clauses, they must be canceled and replaced with 'The Chinese text shall prevail' to maintain the principle of equality. Is the above two points appropriate? Please submit it to the chamber for discussion, etc." After the general assembly discussed the results, everyone believed that foreign merchants come to China to trade, and all the decorations and promotion methods of their goods are to figure out the psychology of customers. Indeed, their commercial interests are concerned, and they cannot ignore everything and disregard it recklessly. Now, regarding the affixing of stamp duty and the writing of documents primarily in Chinese, if our business community can unanimously express that we must attach importance to the national system, they should also follow the psychology of customers and think of ways to change their plans. The key to this lies with us, depending on how hard we work. It was resolved to notify all members to earnestly handle this matter, so that the country's tax revenue and contract interpretation can be benefited. This is our sincere hope."

### The Shanghai Industrial Trust Company Opens the Pudong Waterworks

Costing More Than 700,000 Yuan, Opened Today; Daily Output Can Be 3 Million Gallons

The Pudong area is vast, with many factories and warehouses, and the population has been increasing year by year. However, the waterworks facilities are still lacking, which affects both sanitation and fire protection. The municipal government, in view of this, ordered the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company in October 1934 to actively prepare for the establishment of a waterworks. After receiving the order, the company immediately engaged in meticulous research on water sources, buildings, and water production equipment, striving for perfection, economy, and rationality, so that the water price can be fair, to meet the expectations of the citizens. After detailed investigation, it was determined that at least 3 million gallons of water must be prepared daily to meet the needs. Experts were immediately hired to design the waterworks and order the latest water production equipment and pipes from famous factories. Construction began in September 1935 and was completed eight months later. The total cost of the plant base, building, water production equipment, main pipes, and other additional materials and temporary supplementary projects was more than 700,000 yuan in national currency. The estimated operating income and expenditure will not be sufficient to offset the cost until five years later. The company did not hesitate to invest such a large sum for the sake of public welfare. It is now learned that the Pudong Waterworks is scheduled to open today, and from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, it will invite people from all walks of life to visit and report on the preparation process. The general construction of the plant is divided into the following sections: ㊀ Plant Site: The only water source in Shanghai is the Huangpu River. After expert appraisal, the water source is deeper on the Pudong side and is not easily silted up. The land is solid, and the most suitable place is at the Youlong Road outlet in Pudong. Therefore, a site was purchased in Taoyuanzhai, Yangjing District, near the Pudong River to build the waterworks. ㊁ Building: All buildings are of the latest design, occupying a small area but with great efficiency. There is an inlet pump room on the Pudong River with a capacity of 2,175 cubic meters, a sedimentation basin with two compartments, 196 square meters each, a rapid filter basin with five compartments, 3,650 cubic meters of customer water, a clear water basin with two compartments, and a clear water pump room. The clear water basin is closed with steel-concrete three-way soil, and 15 vents are installed on top to keep the water quality absolutely clean. A 9.85-meter high water tower with a capacity of 315 cubic meters is specially designed for flushing the quick filter sand and the water used in the plant. Other rooms such as the alum addition room, the chemical test room, the office, and the material room have been planned and built separately. ㊂ Machinery: All machines in the plant are powered by electricity, which is highly efficient and easy to manage. There are two mixed water motor pumps in the inlet room. When water is taken, there is first a cat-eye steel mesh to isolate the inflow of fish, and then a copper wire mesh to prevent the absorption of coarse sand. There are two clear water motor pumps in the outlet room, one of which is for backup. ㊃ Trunk Pipe: From the inlet room on the Pudong River to the sedimentation basin, a 500 mm diameter inlet pipe of 300 meters is installed. The water supply trunk pipes for each route are temporarily divided into two phases for separate laying. In the first phase, from the waterworks to Qichangzhan in the north and Tangqiao in the south, excluding branch pipes, a 500 mm diameter trunk pipe of 230 meters and a 300 mm diameter trunk pipe of 2,800 meters have been laid and completed in December 1936. In the second phase, from Yangjing in the north to Bailianjing in the south, and from Qichangzhan to Yangjing Town, the total length is 3.5 kilometers. From Tangqiao to Bailianjing, the total length is 3.1 kilometers. It will continue to be laid in the near future. ㊄ Sedimentation and Disinfection Method: The turbid water drawn in from the inlet room is added with appropriate alum water by machine in the alum addition room and sent to the sedimentation basin. There are separate cement boards in the sedimentation basin to block the water flow and allow the mixed water that has been added with alum to gradually settle after a considerable period of travel and twists, so that when it reaches the rapid filter, the water quality is clear as a mirror. After sand filtration, it is collected in the clear water basin and disinfected by adding chlorine gas with a chlorine gas machine before being output by the clear water pump room. ㊅ Chemical Test: There is a state-of-the-art chemical test room in the plant. The instruments used are purchased at a great cost, and the most accurate and expensive instruments are used. Specialized technicians are hired to specialize in testing the water quality. Every day, the turbid water of the Huangpu River is tested first to know the amount of sand, mud, and bacteria contained in the water, so as to determine the amount of alum to be added. After the turbid water has been settled and sand-filtered, it is tested again to determine the various components contained in the water quality, and then tested to determine the amount of disinfectant to be used. After disinfection, a bacterial test is performed to verify whether the disinfectant is suitable. ㊆ Water Output: A special water meter is used to record the daily water output. The maximum daily output is 3 million gallons.

### The Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department to Negotiate the Illegal Removal of Awnings

Where is the Law for Unauthorized Destruction of Residents' Property? Quickly Investigate and Handle According to Law and Provide Full Compensation

The Public Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter yesterday to Festing, Director General of the Public Works Department, stating, "Dear Sir, According to the letter from taxpayer Qiu Shanzhi, citizen Qiu Shanzhi resides at No. 23-25, Lane 625, Dongyouheng Road, Public Concession. Due to the exorbitant rent in this city, he built an awning in the courtyard, which has been in place for more than ten years, and the Public Works Department has never objected. Unexpectedly, on the 19th of last month, he received a notice from the Public Works Department, ordering him to remove it within seven days. The citizen believes that there are no less than tens of thousands of houses with awnings in the Concession. The Public Works Department should take into account economic reasons and the interests of the public, and there must be another plan. Moreover, the citizen's awning does not pose any harm to fire safety or sanitation. Therefore, he did not reply and was considering remedies. However, on the 2nd of this month, the Public Works Department, led by Westerner Mr. Mullipo, forcibly removed the awning with a large number of workers, and arbitrarily destroyed the citizen's furniture, bedding, etc., estimating the loss to be worth more than 30 yuan in national currency. The barbaric behavior and oppressive means are not acceptable to the citizen. Moreover, the Public Works Department suddenly ordered the destruction before issuing the final notice, which is unreasonable. This is why the citizen is heartbroken and cannot bear to remain silent. Therefore, on the 3rd, he submitted three points to the Public Works Department for written negotiation, which are recorded as follows: ㊀ There are at least ten families in this lane who have built awnings. Have they all registered with your department? Why did only eight families receive the notice? Since there are eight families, why were only four families demolished? ㊁ The Public Works Department should immediately compensate for the damaged items, amounting to 30 yuan in national currency. ㊂ Please thoroughly investigate whether the officials in charge of this matter are suspected of corruption. After sending the letter, the Public Works Department invited the citizen to the Public Works Bureau for a conversation. Now, the oral statements of both parties are recorded as follows: According to the Public Works Department, if the residents who built awnings do not remove them after receiving the notice from the Public Works Department, the department can forcibly remove them. The citizen immediately replied, 'I have no jealousy towards the residents who have not removed their awnings. It is because the Public Works Department's handling is unfair. And I absolutely oppose the Public Works Department taking such actions against the taxpaying citizens. When the items were damaged during the demolition, Mr. Mullipo, the Westerner in charge, had promised compensation, but now he intends to deny it, and the Public Works Department has not made any statement and has not resolved the matter satisfactorily. I believe that the citizen's power is weak and his words are light, so he has to appeal to your association, hoping that your association will provide considerable assistance and negotiate with the Public Works Department according to law, especially to achieve the goal of compensation, and to retain the already built buildings, such as mezzanines and awnings, and not to demolish them again, and to ask the highest authorities of the Public Works Department to thoroughly investigate whether the officials in charge of this matter are suspected of corruption.' After checking, the taxpayer's awning was built twenty years ago, and your department has never objected, and should not have objected. Moreover, there is more than one family in this lane, and not only in this lane, who have built awnings. The awning is a material possession, and is indeed a part of the resident's property. Now, without a court ruling that it is an illegal object, they led the people to arbitrarily destroy it and damage other furniture, treating the law as nothing and the court as a superfluous tumor. It is really bewildering as to what kind of situation we are in. Moreover, many of the important officials of your department are people from countries with the rule of law, but their actions often violate the law and order, which not only brings shame to the rule of law, but also reminds us of the more than one hundred thousand yuan that the former taxpayers spent on hiring the jurist Feitang, who spent a year writing the survey report on the Concession, which stated that the 'rule of law' of the municipal authorities in the Concession is not adequately recognized. In view of the foregoing, we hereby write to request your department to promptly and thoroughly investigate and handle the matter in accordance with the law, to provide satisfactory compensation, and to ensure that similar unfortunate incidents do not occur again. This is addressed to Festing, Director General of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."

### Latvian Aviator Cox Flies to Hong Kong

Latvian aviator Captain Cox has recently been flying around the Far East. He arrived in Shanghai from Japan a few days ago and planned to take the route through Fuzhou and Hong Kong to fly back to his country the next day. However, due to rain in Fuzhou, the airfield was slightly flooded, which caused the delay. He flew away from Longhua Airfield at 10:05 AM on Monday morning to head straight to Hong Kong, because the Fuzhou Airfield is still not dry. The weather along the southern coast has been very bad for days, but Cox was eager to return and did not care. Before leaving, Cox expressed his gratitude for the warm reception he received from the Chinese officials.

### Shanghai Municipal Government Orders Strict Investigation of Speculators

Triggered by the Turmoil in Yarn and Flour Trading

Recently, the Shanghai market has experienced drastic fluctuations in the price of yarn on the yarn exchange, causing widespread anxiety. The central party and government authorities have dispatched senior officials to Shanghai to investigate. Yesterday, the responsible person of the Municipal Government issued the following statement: The Bureau of Social Affairs has been secretly investigating the speculation and manipulation in yarn, cloth, and flour exchanges, which have brewed a storm. Because yarn, flour, and cloth are essential for the clothing and food of the common people, a small number of speculative merchants must not be allowed to manipulate and monopolize them. Although the central government has sent personnel to investigate the current turmoil, the Municipal Government believes that the matter concerns local finance, the livelihood of the common people, and has far-reaching implications. Therefore, it has ordered the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Police Bureau to cooperate with the central government to strictly investigate and arrest speculators who disrupt the market for prosecution.

Recently, Jiuxin Enamel Factory on Manufacturing Bureau Road changed its factory hours, leading to a work slowdown by about seventy workers who clamored in the factory at approximately 6:00 AM yesterday. The factory's staff advised them to no avail. Then, the factory's manager, Gu Zhijian (62 years old, from Chuansha), explained the reasons for the change in hours to the workers.

### Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Cables Request for Medical Personnel to Sichuan

Also Cables Liu Xiang Requesting Strict Prohibition of Hoarding

The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Research Association yesterday cabled the Executive Yuan, stating: (Omitted salutations) "Regarding the request to order the Ministry of Health to dispatch medical personnel to Sichuan as soon as possible to implement epidemic prevention. After the harsh government in Sichuan, it has suffered a major disaster. We are deeply grateful for the many plans and efforts of the Executive Yuan to rescue us. However, the disaster victims throughout the province often compete to eat tree bark, grass roots, white mud, and corpses. They want to prolong their lives for a moment, but they die because of this. Rotting corpses are everywhere, and it is difficult to bury them all. As the hot summer is approaching, toxic gases are fumigating, leading to widespread epidemics in various places. For the sake of all the people of Sichuan, if there is no prevention, there will be no survivors. We beseech the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Health to immediately dispatch medical personnel to Sichuan to implement epidemic prevention work, so that the remnants of this disaster will not die from the epidemic. The whole province will be grateful beyond measure. We send this cable with utmost anticipation." The association also cabled Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, stating: (Omitted salutations) "The disaster situation in Sichuan is tragic and unseen in nearly a century. The colleagues of our association are all from Sichuan, and they are deeply concerned about their homeland. We express our sorrow and lament the suffering of the people. Our government authorities and compatriots at home and abroad, as well as foreigners, are all able to act with compassion and work together to rescue those who are suffering. However, we have heard that in Chengdu and Chongqing, there are propertied classes who are buying up large quantities of rice and hoarding it for speculation, manipulating market prices, and turning a blind eye to the tragedy, placing the disaster victims in a desperate situation. There is nothing more immoral. We dare to ask you to immediately order local officials to work with various legal groups to strictly prohibit hoarding and speculation, and to order them to sell at fair prices to help the disaster victims and relieve the people's hardship. We eagerly anticipate this."

### Major Disturbance at Shanghai Brewery - Armed Detectives on High Alert - Tear Gas Fired

Mediation by Municipal Party Department Personnel on Scene - Factory Accepts Conditions and the Disturbance Subsides

The Shanghai Brewery at No. 130 Yichang Road, West Shanghai, has a long history, ample capital, and a large scale. The factory employs over three hundred workers. Previously, the factory reorganized its internal affairs and reduced workers' wages accordingly. Recently, with the onset of summer, sales have increased sharply, and the workers have demanded the restoration of their original wages. However, the factory has not responded, causing dissatisfaction among the workers, who jointly declared a strike at approximately 6:00 AM yesterday, and presented two conditions: ㊀ Restore original wages. ㊁ Increase wages by double at the end of the month. Labor and management were deadlocked until approximately 11:00 AM. The Putuo Road police station, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched more than forty Chinese and foreign detectives, first arriving in police cars to suppress the situation. Considering the large number of workers at the factory, they notified the Russian Volunteer Corps Security Brigade and dispatched over two hundred members, fully armed, to continue to the scene. Thus, the workers and detectives were in a state of confrontation. Seeing the urgency of the situation, the workers climbed to the second, third, and fourth floors and threw glass bottles at the police, and locked the iron doors to prevent the police from rushing in, making it impossible for the police to enter the factory. They first tried to destroy the door locks and fired tear gas into the building before they could enter. Dozens of workers were initially captured, but most of the workers took the factory's key personnel, including the Westerner Yi Lixun, to the highest level and locked the door, preparing for a final resistance, causing the situation at the time to be extremely serious. Traffic around the factory was completely cut off. However, all the detectives remained calm and did not fire a single shot. Furthermore, the factory's production machinery was worth millions of gold, so they were reluctant to take any rash action. The police also stopped their military action because the Westerner Yi Lixun was being detained inside the factory. At the same time, personnel from the Municipal Party Department were dispatched to the scene to mediate. As a result, the factory accepted the wage increase conditions and allowed the police not to arrest any workers. Therefore, the workers began to leave the factory one after another at 3:00 PM and returned home. It is said that work will resume as usual today.

### The Shady Dealings of the Yarn Factory's Meal Providers - A Female Worker Suddenly Dies

Father and Brothers of the Deceased Unable to Reclaim the Body - The Main Perpetrator is at Large and the Family Reports for an Autopsy

In the abnormal society of Shanghai, there is a type of meal provider for yarn factory workers, whose control of child laborers and female workers is appalling. These so-called meal providers are actually former workers who are familiar with the foremen or factory staff and can introduce people to work. Most of them are from Jiangbei and other places. They recruit impoverished child laborers in the countryside and house them in their homes, in cramped bed spaces like pigeon cages, or even in lofts, sleeping on the floor. They provide them with prison-like food and drive them to work in the factory. All the sweat and blood earned from wages is handed over to them, with terms often lasting four or five years, or sometimes shorter. In short, it is impossible to leave within a year or more. During this period, the worker's father and brothers have virtually no right to question their children. Even the right to arrange marriages can be exercised on their behalf. If one were to investigate the income items, the meal fees and room fees are all legitimate, but the exploitation of impoverished workers is extreme. Now, a death has occurred in a yarn factory meal provider's residence at No. 178, behind the Central Mint in the west end of Tanziwan, Zhabei. Yesterday, the guarantor Zhang Xietang reported to the local court that the meal provider at the address was Zhao from Jiangbei, whose family had eight young female workers. A young girl surnamed Zhu, a native of Zhenjiang, was 15 years old and had been in Shanghai for only five months. Because her father and brothers did not want their daughter to be treated like cattle and horses, they planned to reclaim her. However, Zhao refused to allow it. Unexpectedly, she suddenly died yesterday afternoon. The cause of death is unknown. The father reported to the authorities, and Zhao fled. Zhao's wife was detained by the authorities, so they requested an autopsy. The case was interrogated by Prosecutor Wang Guangquan, who ordered an autopsy to be conducted.

### Customs Officers Who Allowed Smuggling Sentenced to Eight Years

Yesterday, Judge Xu sentenced Dong to eight years of imprisonment and Yuan and Mao to seven years each, noting that the amount they received was small and still reduced the sentence.

### Huge Vault Door for Bank of China

Valued at 1.75 Million Yuan

The huge vault door for the Bank of China's new building was custom-made in the United States. Weighing more than 60,000 pounds, it is 9 feet 11 inches long, 8 feet 4 inches wide, and 5 feet 8 inches high. It is sturdily constructed, and even scientifically advanced thieves would be unable to use their skills. Last night, it began to be transported from the Beijing Road Wharf to the bank's new building at the corner of Renji Road. Although the distance was short, the door was extremely heavy. Two tow trucks from the Shanghai Electric Power Company and dozens of coolies were used to slowly move it. It finally arrived at its destination around dawn. Chinese and foreign police officers were on the scene to ensure that passing vehicles detoured. It is said that the door, including shipping costs, is valued at 1.75 million yuan. The vault is the most modern in the Far East and has 14,000 safe deposit boxes.

### Husband Leaves Home for a Year, Wife Becomes Heavily Pregnant

Living with a Lover - Arrested by Police in Zhabei - Prosecutor Files Charges of Adultery

Zheng Zicheng, a 37-year-old native of Shaoxing residing at No. 3 Hengyu Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei, previously worked at the telephone bureau and married Zheng Zhang (also known as Zhang Linhe, 29 years old, with good looks). Unfortunately, Zheng Zicheng contracted an eye disease in May of last year, which nearly blinded him. He lost his job, and the couple, who only knew how to enjoy life and not share hardship, quarreled day and night. The patient could not bear the pain and left home to stay at the home of his friend, Dr. Hu Yifang, at No. 82 Cian Lane, Hartung Road. He earned money by registering patients on Dr. Hu's behalf, and then went to the Shanghai Sanatorium to treat his eye disease while still looking for a job. Time passed quickly, and a year had passed. Zheng's eye disease had improved, and he returned home, but his wife was nowhere to be found and all the belongings had been moved out. At the same time, Ma Pingliang, a tenant living in the rear building (22 years old, a mechanic at the telegraph bureau on Fourth Avenue), also suddenly moved out, which was very suspicious. After investigating the neighborhood, people said that Ma and Zheng's wife had an affair. Zheng reported to the police station, and Li Wei, Ma's guarantor, was detained. Li confessed that Ma and Zheng Zhang were having an affair and living together in Linde Lane, Yanjiagang, Zhabei. The police were dispatched and Zheng Zhang was arrested, only to find that she was heavily pregnant and about to give birth. Zheng was furious at this discovery. Since he had left home in May of last year, who was the father of the child in her womb? After interrogation by the police station, Zheng Zhang admitted that after her husband left, she could not bear to live alone and could not bear the hunger. Therefore, she became acquainted with Ma Pingliang in August. Since Ma had not been caught, Zheng Zhang was first transferred to the local court for investigation by the prosecutor. Zheng Zhang then testified that she was raped by Ma one night in August after she fell asleep. Since the deed was done, she made a big mistake. Therefore, the prosecutor, in addition to ordering Zheng to take her back due to her impending delivery, also prosecuted Zheng Zhang and Ma Pingliang for adultery. Yesterday, Judge Wang Shanxiang opened the trial. Zheng Zicheng testified about the previous events, saying, "We were married in a Shaoxing church in 1922. After I took her back this time, she was at home during the day and went out at night, and she even threatened me. And now she is pregnant, how can I face people?" When asked, Zheng Zhang testified that her husband had taken a concubine and did not come often. Only in August and September of last year did her husband return several times. The baby in her belly was her husband's seed. She had not committed adultery with Ma Pingliang at all. What she said to the prosecutor was what her husband told her to say. Ma Pingliang also turned himself in and argued that he was a tenant and was falsely accused because he failed to borrow money. The court adjourned the trial for another hearing. Ma Pingliang was released on bail.

Xue Bao, an elderly man from Changshu, was in his sixties. He had been setting up a stinky tofu stand at the entrance of the Gui Ren Lane in Tangjia Lane, Qipu Road, for 20 years. Therefore, residents in the area knew Xue Bao. At 7:45 PM on the 7th of this month, Xue Bao was stabbed to death by his fellow villager Mu Genjin in No. 394 Lane, Qipu Road. The murderer was arrested on the spot and sent to the First Special Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station prosecuted him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. The case has been investigated and concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng announced the verdict in the Eighth Criminal Court. The main text of the judgment stated that Mu Genjin was guilty of murder and sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights.

### Female Passenger Dies Suddenly on Desheng Steamer

The Deceased Was Named Chen Jinfeng, a Native of Chaozhou - Intended to Seek Treatment Elsewhere Due to Stomach Illness

On the Desheng steamer of the China Navigation Company, sailing from Hong Kong back to Shanghai, a female passenger suddenly died while sailing in the waters of Zhejiang Province. It was not until the ship reached Songkou that the Customs Water Police Station was notified. Detective Wang Haiquan took the body ashore. It was learned that the deceased's name was Chen Jinfeng, 29 years old, a native of Chaozhou. Her husband's name was Chen Huanzhi, who was a businessman in Hong Kong. Chen Jinfeng had suffered from a stomach illness for six years and was coming to Shanghai for treatment. Her husband had accompanied her to Shantou to disembark and return to their hometown. The detective took the body to the Rescue Bureau. The day before yesterday evening, Prosecutor Ma of the local court determined that the death was due to a serious illness and ordered the deceased's younger sister, Xiujuan, to take the body for burial.

### Two More Robbers in Jiangsu Bank Robbery Case Interrogated and Concluded

Police Request that the Two Robbers Be Charged with Robbery and Murder

At 5:00 PM on February 3 of this year, several robbers attempted to rob the Jiangsu Bank branch on Xinzha Road, which was sending more than 7,000 yuan to the head office. They failed and opened fire, killing Shi Jianzhi, the bank's security guard, and wounding bodyguards Jiang Ziqin and Gu Wenlin, and rickshaw puller Chen Youru. The Lao Zha police station arrested Zhang Shaoqing and others and sent them to the First Special Court. Zhang Shaoqing and Zhao Jinrong were each sentenced to death, and the others were sentenced to imprisonment. After Zhang and others were sentenced, the police station arrested Ren Shaoye (Ren Wenhai) and Wang Abing, the main culprits in the case, and sent them to the First Special Court. After the start of the debate, lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station stated that although Ren and Wang denied carrying out the shooting, before the case occurred, the criminals had gathered for a meeting, and the most important part of their robbery plan was to shoot and kill the armed personnel hired by the bank before carrying out the robbery. Therefore, they should be held responsible for the murder, even if they did not actually carry out the shooting. Moreover, the two defendants in this case are the main perpetrators, so he requested that the two defendants be sentenced to the most severe punishment for robbery and murder. At the end, the lawyers hired by the two defendants, Huang Xiubo and Lin Yingqing, the court-appointed defense lawyer, defended Ren and Wang. The court adjourned the debate and will announce the verdict next Tuesday.

### Result of Appeal in Xue Xiangyun Case - Sentence for Small Car Driver in French Concession Increased

Xue Xiangyun, daughter of pigment tycoon Xue Baorun, was married to real estate developer Xu Liangchen for more than ten years. Suddenly, Wang Yongquan, a former chauffeur of the Xue family, and his son Wang Genbao filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting confirmation that Genbao was the illegitimate son of Xu and Xue.

The initial trial concluded with Wang Yongquan being found guilty of attempted fraud and sentenced to six months of imprisonment, while Wang Genbao was found not guilty. However, Wang Yongquan did not accept the verdict and hired a lawyer to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. The appellees, Xu and Xue, hired lawyers E Sen and Tang Shenpei as their representatives. The court ordered the debate in the case to be concluded. Yesterday afternoon, President Yu Hua, along with judges Zhou and Xiao, announced the verdict in the First Criminal Court of the High Court.

### Small Cars in French Concession Began Operating Yesterday

The small cars of the Mijie Company began operating in the French Concession yesterday and were available for hire. There are currently only four cars, but it is planned to gradually increase the number if business is successful. These cars are 1937 Austin Sevens models, equipped with taximeters.

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has not yet approved it, so the cars can only operate in the French Concession and cannot enter the Public Concession.

### The Rising Cost of Living in Shanghai: Food, Clothing, and Housing All on the Rise

Sharp Increase in Fuel Costs, Especially Firewood, Drives Index Upward

Rent Reductions Forgotten, Rent Increases Materialize

Recently in Shanghai, the prices of goods have been gradually increasing, leading to a rise in the cost of living index. Those with meager incomes are finding it increasingly difficult to live here. A reporter from the Datong News Agency has obtained information from the National Tariff Commission regarding the cost of living index for the past month, as follows:

Sharp Increase in Living Index

The general cost of living index for Shanghai uses 1926 as the baseline, representing 100 points. In the interim, with the decline of the Shanghai market, the index fell below 100 points. However, compared to May of last year, it had already risen to 111.1. By April of this year, it had further increased to 117.4. The index for the past month has surged to 118.7, the highest record since 1931, leading citizens to feel that living in Shanghai is becoming increasingly difficult.

Firewood Fuels the Rise

The cost of living index is based on the price fluctuations of five categories: food, clothing, housing, fuel, and miscellaneous items. Here is a further breakdown: The category with the most significant price increase in the past month was fuel, rising by 5.7% compared to April. Investigations reveal that the primary reason for this increase was the sudden surge in the price of firewood.

Rice and Vegetable Prices Rise Slowly

The rise in food prices has been relatively slow, with an increase of approximately 0.6% compared to April. Prices for items in this category have shown mixed trends. For example, the retail price of white rice has slightly increased along with wholesale prices, and the prices of peanuts and beef have also been rising. The prices of vegetables, chicken eggs, duck eggs, and soybean oil, and whole chickens and ducks have all fallen uniformly. As a result, the upward trend in this category has been relatively moderate.

Overview of Clothing and Housing

The clothing index in May rose by approximately 1.2% compared to April. This was due to slight increases in the sales prices of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and cotton drill. In the miscellaneous category, price increases for items such as cigarettes caused the index to rise by 0.9% compared to April. Finally, one particularly noteworthy point is that housing rentals have increased in both the western and eastern districts of Shanghai, causing the index to rise by 0.3%.

### Chinese Detective of the Old Zha Gate Police Station Assaults News Reporter

Reporter Intervenes in Public Urination, Suffers Humiliation

Yesterday at around 10:00 PM, Lu, a Chinese detective from the Old Zha Gate Police Station, was urinating at the entrance of Cishu Lane on Guizhou Road. Zhuang Yue, a reporter from the Bingzi News Agency, witnessed this and stepped forward to dissuade him. The Chinese detective, Lu, claimed, "I am a public official. What business is it of yours if I urinate here?" Zhuang responded that it concerned public health and that anyone could intervene. The Chinese detective, Lu, became enraged and began pushing and hitting Zhuang Yue. A large crowd gathered at the entrance of the lane. Lu then called a Western detective, who arrested Zhuang and took him to the Old Zha Gate Police Station. Upon hearing the news, the Bingzi News Agency sent representatives to the police station to investigate. They believe that only legal means can uphold justice. It is reported that Zhuang Yue is a member of the Shanghai News Reporters Association and a committee member of the Interview Reporters Association. The association believes that the Chinese detective, Lu, knowingly violated the law and insulted a news reporter, and has decided to pursue legal action.

### Overseas Chinese Man Yang Xishan Sent to Nursing Home

Overseas Chinese Elder Returns to Homeland

Yang Xishan, an elderly overseas Chinese man originally from Tianjin, returned to China from England alone, not forgetting his homeland. After arriving in Shanghai, he found that due to his many years abroad, he no longer had any relatives or acquaintances in his hometown. As a result, he has been living in Shanghai without any support.

### Liu Meitang Appeals Conviction for Harassing Women

Verdict Awaited After Yesterday's Hearing

Tao Ma Cuihua, 29 years old, a Suzhou native, the second daughter-in-law of Tao Jiayao, the former governor of Jiangxi Province in Nanchang, is beautiful and fashionably dressed. On April 30th of this year, while taking a rickshaw to the Shanghai World College to visit her sick son, at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Wenlin Road, Liu Meitang (26 years old), a Ningbo native and paint merchant from No. 9 Baideli, Gujia Lane, Beijing Road, suddenly rode up on a bicycle and teased her. Ma Cuihua scolded him, and Liu became angry and pulled out a small knife, stabbing Ma's left cheek with a cut about three inches long, causing blood to flow. Ma shouted loudly, and detectives and police officers gave chase. Liu fled eastward, but was knocked down by a French Municipal Council truck and arrested. He was detained and sent to the Second Special Court, where the police department filed a lawsuit according to the law.

### Wu Jinbao's Murder of Xu Guansong Case: Seven Pieces of Evidence Found

Prosecutor Files Charges After Thorough Investigation; Deceased's Wife Asks Judge for Justice

Wu Jinbao (also known as Wu Er), a local from No. 2 Xujiazhai, Hongzhen, 35 years old, nicknamed Bandit Jinbao, was suspected of manufacturing poison pills in October 1936. The police bureau went to his home to search it. Wu fled upon hearing the news and his belongings were confiscated and entrusted to the local guarantor Xu Guansong for safekeeping. Later, because the belongings were stolen, the police bureau ordered Xu Guansong to hire someone to move the sealed furniture to the bureau. Wu learned of this and suspected that Xu was messing with him, and held a grudge. On November 11th of the same year, at around 8:00 PM, he and his brother Wu Gensheng plotted with their apprentice Liu Tianbao to lure Xu Guansong to a place not far from the entrance of Xufufu's house. Wu Jinbao used his unlicensed pistol to shoot and kill Xu. He then fled. Various agencies pursued him but were unable to arrest him. It was not until 3:00 AM on May 20th of this year that the Third Division of the Detective Team of the Municipal Police Bureau arrested Wu Jinbao at the Pingqiao Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession and transferred him to the Local Court. Prosecutor Chen Shengzu thoroughly investigated and found Wu Jinbao guilty of the following seven pieces of evidence: ㊀ The condition of the corpse's injuries. ㊁ The testimony of the corpse's wife, Xu Luo. ㊂ The defendant's confession to the detective team. ㊃ A secret letter. ㊄ Document No. 030 issued by the Municipal Police Bureau. ㊅ A bullet. ㊆ A pistol. His guilt was completely clear, so he was prosecuted for the crime of murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and the crime of possessing firearms under Article 187. Yesterday, Judge Chen Kangsun opened the trial. Xu Luo testified, "I am 42 years old, a local, living at No. 4 Xujia Bridge, Hongzhen. The deceased, Xu Guansong, was my husband. He was killed by Wu Jinbao. On the evening of September 28th of the lunar calendar last year, Wu sent his apprentice Liu Tianbao to tell my husband, 'The Old Man' is waiting at the Hongku Lang tea house, asking my husband to go out. When he walked to the entrance of Xu Fufu's house at No. 37 Xujia Bridge East, he was shot and killed. My family has elderly in-laws in their 60s and 70s, and five children. When Liu Tianbao called out, my mother-in-law and five young children all heard it. My eldest son, who is 20 years old this year, went to see his father and he was lying in front of No. 17. The cause of this case is that Wu was secretly selling red pills, and the police bureau found out and came to arrest him. He ran away, and the police bureau entrusted my husband to seal Wu's house, so Wu held a grudge, saying that my husband had reported him. My husband could earn 30 to 40 yuan a month, and I ask the court to give us justice," and so on. The defendant, in addition to hiring Lawyer Xue Lisheng to present rebuttal evidence, claimed that on the day of the incident, the defendant was handling funeral affairs at a relative's house, and the defendant argued that he usually managed goods at the Mitsubishi Wharf, denying that Liu Tianbao was his apprentice, and heard people say that Liu Tianbao had killed Xu Guansong. Because the plaintiff bit me, I temporarily avoided the concession. That day, Xi Baobao's cousin died, the seventh day was the opening of the hanging, and I did not return until the 29th. As for the previous confession, it was made under torture. Although the pistol was seized from the Wang family in Panjia Bridge, Luodian Town, it was not the murder weapon, but I just casually confessed it under torture because I remembered that the Wang family had a gun, and so on. The court ordered an investigation and further trial, and the defendant was returned to custody.

### Female Guide Scammed: Crimes Uncovered

Chen Baoxiang Detained Awaiting Sentencing

Chen Baoxiang, a Ningbo native, defrauded Li Ying, a female employee of the Shunfeng Guide Company, of a gold ring and a watch in Room 508 of the Xin Xin Hotel on Guizhou Road on the 10th of this month. Li discovered the fraud and reported it to the police, who arrested Chen. Investigations revealed that Chen specialized in scamming female guides out of their jewelry as a regular occupation. He was sent to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. This case was continued yesterday morning by Judge Ye Shengchao in the Second Criminal Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that, within the period for amendment, it was found that Chen had defrauded female guides of their belongings in various hotels, including Wang Ying of OK, Li Huazhen and Li Aizhen of Shanghai Qingyi Society, Chen Yuying and Pan Meimei of Zhenzhi, Chen Yuzhen of Shenzhou, Zhao Lianjun of Black Cat, Xiong Lili, Wang Yuena, Le Lu, and Fang Laiti, and Hu Xiuqing of Hongmei.

### Stone Cargo Boat's Mast Kills Man

The stone cargo boat No. 10087, owned by Fang Jincai from Jiangbei, hired Zhu Wenyu from Funing as the boatman. Due to years of disrepair, Fang ordered the boat to be sailed to the Zhang Huabang Shipyard in Pudong for repairs. Yesterday morning, before dawn, Zhu supervised the boat crew to sail the boat out of the Hongkou port. As they were about to raise the large mast in the middle cabin to hang the sails, the rope suddenly broke, and the mast fell backward with great force. At this time, Zhu Tianchen, the father of boatman Zhu Wenyu, was steering the stern of the boat in place of his son. The mast struck Tianchen on the top of his head, causing his brains to spill out, and he died instantly. The boat crew immediately reported to the water patrol police station, who sent detectives to send the body to the Life Saving Bureau, and reported to the Local Court. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Ma arrived to inspect the body. The body was handed over to his son for coffin and burial.

### Lu Zhengkun Files Lawsuit for Identification and Support, Confirms Identity in Court Mediation

Lu Guanzeng, a junior owner of Yuchang Pawnshop in this city, had a strained relationship with his wife Cheng Shuyun, and Cheng filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court accusing Lu of embezzling more than 110,000 yuan in jewelry.

But now, Lu Zhengkun has filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court Mediation Office requesting confirmation of his identity. The opposing parties listed are Lu Guanzeng's mother, Lu Yu, and Yu Shaoqing. It is reported that Lu claims that he is the daughter of Lu Wu and Yu Shaoqing, so he requests a summons for mediation. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Qufei opened the 11th Civil Court for mediation, but the petitioner Lu Zhengkun neither reported nor had a lawyer represent him. Lu Wu and Yu Shaoqing hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Wang Xiaoshang to appear in court and declared that Lu Zhengkun was simply nonexistent as far as the opposing party knew. Therefore, the alleged facts were known to be fabricated, and the purpose was solely to destroy the petitioner's reputation and achieve extortion. The petitioner's absence shows this, and so on. Judge Wang declared that since the petitioner did not appear in court, mediation could not proceed and was declared unsuccessful.

The factory urgently summoned an ambulance from the Western District Fire Department to transport him to the Shanghai South Hospital for treatment. After the ambulance finished its task and was returning, while turning at the intersection of Chezhan Road and Lujiabang Road, an elderly woman from Anhui province, Wei Yu (54 years old), happened to be walking towards it. She was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked down by the ambulance. The wheels broke her ribs, and she was barely breathing.

### Training Mother Schools

— Ziga

It is said that at the beginning of heaven and earth, in ancient primitive societies, the status of men and women was originally equal. Later, economic power fell into the hands of men, and women were placed into a deplorable fate. However, this era did not last long. When capitalism flourished in Europe, women were able to obtain a little more freedom of activity in society. Unexpectedly, things reached an extreme, and the unfortunate fate would still fall on women. After Hitler took power in Germany, the slogan "Women belong in the home" was re-proposed.

According to reports: "The Berlin Women's Labor Association has been conducting preliminary practice work in children's happiness, cooking, and sewing since 1934, and has established mother schools as the center of its work. There are now 150 mother schools. Recently, in order to train teachers, it has opened a National Mother Training School."

Although there are scholars in the world who, from a psychological point of view, prove that women's abilities are fundamentally weaker than men's, they have not confirmed through scientific experiments that women must be suitable for being a "mother" in the home. Because there are many precedents in the world where women's ability to work in society is no less than that of men, and the duties of a "mother" are therefore solved by the nursery system. However, Hitler's original intention in establishing "Training Mother Schools" is even greater and farther-reaching.

Since the European War, there have been many unemployed people in Germany. According to him, this is naturally due to economic panic, but it is also a major reason why women have all run out of the home to compete with men for jobs in society. Therefore, he first called women back to the home to give all the positions to men, which was considered to have solved the "unemployment" problem, and the return of women to the home was naturally also "employment" at the same time.

But this is ultimately not a thorough solution. The important thing is how to "cure the root cause"! This is the profound meaning of why Hitler wanted to establish "Training Mother Schools."

In the current world situation, most people are unusually turbulent and uneasy. Although "unemployment" is bound to cause "panic," it has its objective causes. However, why can't the unemployed be attributed to a view of fate? This is inevitable and touches on ideological issues. For the sake of eliminating opposition and eliminating future hidden dangers, Hitler's method is to first put those who are restless in prison. In order to improve the thoughts of the people, he could not help but pay attention to the good training of motherhood. Because with a good mother, the people educated by her are naturally pure in thought and have absolutely no unruly behavior. In this way, the rule of the National Socialist Party will be as secure as a rock for millions of years.

The method is very good, and the intention is perfect. Even in our friendly countries, sericulture, cooking, sewing, etc., in girls' high schools are listed as compulsory subjects in home economics. I don't know who is imitating whom. However, our country is now re-"training" everything. I think: it may be worthwhile to imitate this "Training Mother School" for a while.

### New Tricks for Promoting Scripture Reading

— Li Geng

Recently, I saw the news that "He Jian has an unrealistic idea regarding the scope implied by compiling scripture reading dramas, that is, representatives of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism come out to debate on the stage, each expounding their strengths, arguing endlessly, and then a person with morality and literary talent comes out to reconcile them, and integrates their achievements, and the three religions begin to bow their heads in silence..." Chairman He advocates "reading scriptures to save the country," and fears that the propaganda is not strong enough. He uses drama with social characteristics as a propaganda tool, and even came up with this wonderful idea, which shows his intelligence and can be called "unique ingenuity" and "meticulousness"!

The rights and wrongs of reading scriptures, the advancing era has long judged its fate, and there is no need to bother again, let alone hesitate and waver.

However, in fact, the youth of Hunan Province were finally forced to drill into the "scripture collection"! We really don't know whether Chairman He is cultivating youth or destroying youth? Chinese youth born in the present era are very fortunate to have the opportunity to study. How can they not know the importance of their responsibilities and missions and want to have some knowledge and skills of the era in order to fulfill their obligations as citizens? However, their freedom has at least been partially deprived, and they are forced to go to the ancient corpse pile to gnaw on food from the tomb! Such reckless actions have at least reduced the most solid corner of the entire national strength!

Moreover, he also "fantasizes" about using drama to call on the general public to step into the "scripture pile" and uses the drama that is just growing and developing as a "front," which is even more of an encroachment on the future of the entire drama movement, and at least cannot escape the blame for "desecrating the sacred dignity of drama," right?

"What the superiors do, the subordinates follow." Because Chairman He has set such an example, schools at the junior high school level have replaced the Chinese language course with the "scripture reading course," in order to win "the praise of the superiors!" They cannot imagine the harm to hundreds of young people.

Once, I heard a friend say, "A certain important person has too many miscellaneous affairs and cannot concentrate his talent on his duties, wasting his good spirit." Indeed, there are too many examples of wasting spirit. Isn't Chairman He's reversal of reading scriptures also wasting spirit? Why haven't we heard the Chairman publish any excellent grand theories on political improvement? "Intelligence" and "energy" are finally wasted in a pointless abyss!

However, this is not the only "example" of "wasting energy and intelligence"!
