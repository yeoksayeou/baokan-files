### Sino-British Conference Imminent

Special Envoy Kong Has Made Preliminary Contact with British Authorities; Britain is Willing to Actively Invest in China's Successful Reconstruction

[London] Preparations are currently underway here for talks between Chinese Special Envoy Kong and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden. It is generally expected that these talks will address bilateral relations in concrete terms. However, the talks may not begin until after the coronation of the King, as thorough preparation is necessary. On Tuesday evening, Special Envoy Kong had lengthy discussions with Chamberlain and Eden on various issues at a banquet hosted by Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi. Londoners have a favorable impression of China's reconstruction plan, believing it will open up possibilities for significant industrial and economic development, as China has recently shown signs of political and economic prosperity. Today, the "Times" newspaper prominently published news about the improved Chinese trade statistics for January and February of this year, and the recovery of Chinese railway revenues.

[London] The Sino-British Banking Corporation held its annual meeting today. Chairman Bernard stated that 1936 was one of the most promising and beneficial years for commercial and industrial activities in China since the war. Chinese politicians, merchants, and bankers have been commendably diligent and have implemented promising plans to rectify various issues. The satisfactory repayment of old debts is a noteworthy example. This has restored China's creditworthiness, allowing it to raise funds on reasonable terms. Bernard praised the Minister of Railways of China for his capable management of the railways and his personal assessment of railway finances. Regarding future financial ventures in China, he mentioned three difficulties: (1) the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on foreign debt; (2) the obligations of the Washington Treaty; (3) the obligations of the banking consortium agreement. However, he believed that these difficulties could be overcome through patient negotiation. Bernard concluded by drawing attention to the recent movement toward Sino-Japanese rapprochement, stating that, in general, the business and financial communities are increasingly confident in China's future.

[London] Regarding the talks between British and Japanese authorities, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne recently stated in the House of Commons, "Britain and Japan have not engaged in formal negotiations regarding their respective interests in China. In recent months, we have held several informal talks with Japanese Ambassador Shigeru Yoshida to discuss ways to promote general relations between Britain and Japan. To date, neither side has put forward concrete proposals regarding interests in China or other issues, and the governments of all relevant countries have been informed of the content of the talks." Liberal Party MP Mander asked, "Is there a possibility that these informal talks will become formal negotiations?" Cranborne replied, "If there is a need, it is certainly possible." He then answered a question from Labour Party MP Kelley, stating, "Britain's consistent policy of respecting China's sovereignty has not changed." (Central News Agency, Havas, 6th)

### Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Discusses Absence of Ambition to Monopolize North China

Hopes to Gradually Resolve Various Outstanding Issues; Regrets Current Lack of Opportunity for Mutual Benefit and Equality

[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Naotake Sato met with foreign journalists today and engaged in extensive and candid discussions on Sino-Japanese relations, the North China issue, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Anglo-Japanese relations with China as the center, and other issues related to Japan's diplomacy with the Soviet Union, the United States, and Germany. Sato also provided the journalists with a written statement, which read in part: "Since the Nanjing talks held last year, there has been no new development in Sino-Japanese relations." Until recently, the two countries, spurred by a shared sentiment, began to seek ways to improve the current situation. As contact between the peoples of the two countries has become more frequent, it has opened the path to greater mutual understanding. I believe that the economic mission to China led by Kenji Kodama, which concluded not long ago, has made great achievements in this regard. I believe that people should seize every opportunity to foster a good and friendly atmosphere, and to make Sino-Japanese cooperation a reality." A reporter from the Central News Agency asked Foreign Minister Sato whether the possibility of conducting negotiations with China based on equality and mutual benefit, as he had stated in the Diet a month ago, would become a reality in the near future. Sato replied in an extremely pessimistic tone, "I myself will try to find various opportunities of this kind, but I fear that there is no opportunity at present." Sato then discussed the North China issue, saying, "Japan does not harbor the intention of establishing a special and monopolistic sphere of influence in North China, but it is particularly difficult to resolve the political issues in North China immediately." Sato continued, "What is more important at present is to resolve several minor outstanding issues in order to improve mutual sentiment. After achieving some success, we can then gradually study whether the time has come to deal with larger issues. Relations between the two countries have fallen into an unpleasant state, which is not in the interests of either side. However, the two countries have been in this kind of relationship for a long time, and we must be extremely careful in finding ways to remove obstacles." The reporter then asked, "What exactly are these obstacles? What do you mean by minor issues?" Sato replied that it would be better not to discuss these issues at present. The reporter also asked what Japan's intentions were regarding economic cooperation with China, which the Chinese people were eager to know. Sato replied, "It is certainly understandable that your people do not fully understand Japan's intentions, because we have never put forward any concrete plans. What we want to do now is to seek to exchange views with leaders in all sectors of your country."

Regarding the London talks, Sato acknowledged that Japan had made proposals to the British government several months ago, but said that the talks on general Anglo-Japanese relations had not touched on any substantive issues and were of a preliminary nature, so no conclusions had been reached. Therefore, it would be premature to think that there was a similar agreement at present. Regarding Japanese-Soviet relations, Sato was more optimistic, saying that although the issue of a non-aggression treaty had not been discussed, improvement of Japanese-Soviet relations was possible if it was approached with patience and determination. He also said that the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany was not an obstacle to improving Japanese-Soviet relations.

When Sato was asked about rumors of a non-aggression treaty between Japan and the United States, he implied that this plan was a coincidence and that he had no definite idea of making a proposal to the United States. He said that he was deeply interested in this view. Finally, Sato smiled and said frankly, "As a mere Foreign Minister, I really don't know how long I can stay in office." (Central News Agency, 6th)

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato gave a detailed account of Japan's diplomatic relations with various countries to fifty foreign journalists today, saying that friendship between Britain and Japan was one of the pillars supporting world peace, and also discussed Japan's relations with China, the Soviet Union, Germany, and the United States. This was Sato's first meeting with foreign reporters since taking office as Foreign Minister. Sato said that recently, the international situation around Japan had gradually shown signs of progress. As for myself, I am working hard to resolve many of the complex issues in our foreign relations in order to promote world peace. I believe that after the peaceful conclusion of the Keelung incident and the settlement of the issue of water and land leases, relations between Britain and Japan have improved. Furthermore, Prince Chichibu's visit to Britain to attend the coronation ceremony has greatly contributed to enhancing harmonious sentiments between the two countries, which could not have been achieved by other means. I hope that this opportunity will enable the traditional friendship between Britain and Japan to be strengthened and become one of the pillars supporting world peace.

Sato also said that the Anti-Comintern Pact that we have concluded with Germany is, of course, based on the friendship between Japan and Germany. Although some quarters overseas seem to misunderstand this, especially the Soviet Union, the main purpose of this pact is purely for common defense to resist the dangerous and destructive activities of the Comintern. This has been clearly announced by the governments of both countries when concluding this pact. Our policy is to enhance friendly relations with Germany on the one hand, and to consolidate our friendship with other countries on the other.

Sato continued by referring to Japanese-American relations, stating that there are no troublesome issues between Japan and the United States in politics or other matters. Friendship between America and Japan is closely maintained by good economic and commercial relations between the two countries, which will certainly develop more and more each year.

Sato further mentioned commercial and economic relations with other countries, stating that agreements with the Dutch East Indies and with India have recently been concluded, and that negotiations with the Union of South Africa and Egypt are currently underway.

Sato concluded by referring to the World Economic Conference, saying that we very much hope that this conference will create an opportunity to restore free trade as soon as possible. We have consistently advocated for free trade in these past few years. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 6th)

### Freight Car Carrying Rice on Yuehan Railway Derails Again in Juntian

Both Locomotives Damaged; Several Injured, Including Drivers

[Guangzhou]

Freight train No. 1855, carrying rice on the Yuehan Railway, departed from Yingde Station on the 4th. After arriving at Juntian Station, it was originally intended to stop temporarily to wait for the northbound train to pass through the station. Unexpectedly, due to faulty parts and the inclined curved track, the driver was unable to stop the train, causing it to run straight to the No. 1338 pile position outside the rail point of the southbound track at Juntian Station and collide directly with an empty northbound train. As a result, both locomotives were damaged, and three southbound rice cars and two northbound empty cars were also derailed, damaging two steel rails and more than twenty sleepers. Several employees were slightly injured. After the accident, the Transportation Section Chief and the Works Section Chief immediately organized a rescue train after receiving the report and personally led employees and doctors to the scene of the accident to provide intensive care.

### Executive Yuan Announces Food Regulation Measures

To be Implemented from August 1; Rice Merchants in Guangdong Petition the Provincial Government

[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan previously ordered the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to formulate six food regulation measures in order to regulate food in various provinces across the country.

(3) If the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance deem it necessary to prohibit the export of a certain type of food, they should immediately submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval. If the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance deem it necessary to transport food to areas with insufficient food, they should designate the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau or the Food Transportation and Sales Bureau to coordinate with local officials to transport food for regulation from harvest areas. If the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance deem it necessary to transport foreign rice and wheat with tax exemptions or tax reductions due to a domestic food shortage for regulation, they should submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval and assign the Ministry of Industry's Agricultural and Commercial Bureau or the Ministry of Finance's Food Transportation and Sales Bureau to purchase and transport it, and merchants should not be allowed to purchase and transport it freely to prevent abuses. (4) The local food transported by the Ministry of Industry's Agricultural and Commercial Bureau or the Ministry of Finance's Food Transportation and Sales Bureau may be discussed with the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways to reduce railway and shipping costs, and priority should be given to transportation. (5) In provinces with higher rice and wheat production, the Ministry of Industry should cooperate with local governments to conduct rice and wheat inspections to standardize their quality, and at the same time, supervise and assist local governments in improving food processing equipment.

### Sichuan Relief Association Hosts Gathering in Nanking Yesterday

Submitting Recommendations to the Sichuan Provincial Government: Emphasis on Reducing Troops and Managing Arms Industry

[Nanjing] The Sichuan Relief Association hosted representatives from the press, various ministries, and departments on the 6th, reporting on the disaster situation in Sichuan. Subsequently, they discussed carrying out disaster relief and contributing to the Sichuan Provincial Government on reducing troops, managing the arms industry, restricting opium planting, reducing taxes and salaries, and organizing a Sichuan Disaster Relief Committee. There was also discussion on the issuance of 12 million yuan in Sichuan disaster relief bonds and hopes that Liu Xiang would reform Sichuan politics. According to Chen Changheng's report, Sichuan's local budget has never complied with the central government's orders and has not been audited by the central government according to law. Therefore, Sichuan's past annual budget has even reached 80 million yuan, of which 50 million yuan was used for military expenses, an unbearable burden for the people. The chaos and large number of troops in Sichuan, currently estimated at 500,000, is even greater than Japan's standing army and urgently needs to be reorganized in accordance with the central government's intentions to save the disaster-stricken people. (6th Special Telegram)

A large sum of money is needed to handle relief and rehabilitation separately, otherwise, there is no way to start. The Ministry of Finance recently issued a telegram stating that the Ministry of Finance is discussing the issuance of disaster relief bonds with the Sichuan authorities, which is necessary. Our opinions are as follows: ㊀ The Sichuan authorities should quickly negotiate with the Ministry of Finance to determine the fund and issue Sichuan disaster relief bonds to handle various relief matters. ㊁ The leaders of the Sichuan party, government, military, and local communities should organize a Sichuan Disaster Relief Committee to manage public bonds and various donations and formulate various relief plans and be responsible for their implementation. ㊂ The Sichuan authorities should follow the example of disaster relief in other provinces, quickly reduce administration and salaries, and stop urgent matters in this year's policy plan and allocate their budget funds for relief. ㊃ The projects for which funds have been raised, such as the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and various highways, should be carried out quickly by the provincial government to remove obstacles. ㊄ All of Sichuan's existing cooperation fund of 3 million yuan should be used to manage cooperative agricultural loans by district, and the Agricultural Bank of China should be requested to send personnel to Sichuan to jointly manage cooperative credit unions with the provincial government by county. ㊅ Sichuan should quickly establish a water conservancy agency and allocate annual funds for a fundamental plan to revitalize agriculture and prevent natural disasters, which should be implemented step by step. The above six items are urgent tasks. We Sichuanese, whether in Sichuan or abroad, should first donate generously and do our best for this huge natural disaster. We should also earnestly ask people across the country to act with human sympathy and a spirit of mutual assistance and rescue, and actively donate to help the dying victims recover. This is what our colleagues in the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association sincerely pray for. (6th Central News Agency telegram)

### Japan-Soviet Relations and Japanese-Puppet Military Intelligence

— Yu

The fundamental transformation of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly the responsibility of Japan. Two months ago, Japanese political circles held that "Japan and the Soviet Union should not engage in war for at least ten years." Five months ago, the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty was extended for one year. Relations between the two countries seemed to be gradually easing. However, Japan's demands on the Soviet Union, such as ㊀ establishing a border committee to resolve border issues, ㊁ withdrawing Far East armaments to resolve the so-called "Manchukuo" threat, and ㊂ ceasing communist propaganda to stabilize the so-called Far East security, have so far yielded no results. This is intolerable to the eager-to-succeed young Japanese military officers. The temporary peace between the two countries is due to two reasons: First, Japanese diplomats, aware of international isolation, have had to slightly change course. Second, the Soviet Union's rapid economic construction, the completion of the Far East "Maginot Line," and the aggressive expansion of its naval and air forces have made its strength very strong, forcing Japan to exercise some caution.

After Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev returned to Japan from the Soviet Union, he held several meetings with Japanese Foreign Minister Sato to improve relations between the two countries. The Soviet Union is most concerned about the Japan-Germany alliance. Yurenev frankly admitted to his opposition when he first arrived in Japan. Japan hopes to resolve outstanding issues, but these issues are the result of Japanese military actions. If Japan does not change its past policies and abandon its ambitions, these issues will not have a satisfactory outcome. This is certain. Japan-Soviet relations will likely remain in a state of uncertainty for some time.

However, to speculate on the negative side, relations between the two countries may very well deteriorate to the extreme. Japan's recent domestic unrest may trigger an external wave to divert the attention of the domestic population and maintain power. Therefore, we cannot but pay close attention to the recent movements of the puppet troops in Chahar Province, the Chengde meeting at the end of the month, and the rumored deployment of heavy Japanese and puppet troops in Duolun, Chengde, Jinzhou, Bu Kui, Manzhouli, Tongjiang, and Suifenhe. If these military activities do not imply that Japanese soldiers and diplomats are parting ways and starting anew, then they should serve to divert attention. In any case, the development of these activities is a great threat to peace in the Far East, and may lead to drastic changes in Japan-Soviet relations and Sino-Japanese relations.

The defendants listed above are involved in the 1369th case of murder and disrupting public order in the 25th year of the Republic of China. After investigation, it is deemed that a public prosecution should be filed. The criminal facts, evidence, and applicable laws are described below.

Criminal Facts

Defendant Liu Lu-yin was once nominated as the Minister of Propaganda of the Central Party Department, but did not take office. Last year, the Southwest established the People's Movement Committee, and he was elected as a Standing Committee member. Out of jealousy of former Hubei Provincial Government Chairman Yang Yong-tai, former Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, Minister of Interior Jiang Zuo-bin, Minister of Communications Yu Fei-peng, and Chairman Chiang, he jointly instigated cadres Yang Xiao-ming (also known as Yang Er-qian, Yang You-sheng, Yang Bo-kun, Yang Qi-zhen, Xu Chao), using the alias Xu Qun, to organize an assassination organization in Shanghai to seek opportunities to assassinate them. In April of the same year, due to fewer opportunities in Shanghai, the organization was expanded, and the target was shifted to Nanjing and Hubei, with Shanghai still serving as the center of operations. Yang Xiao-ming, under the name of Xu Qun, drafted a plan, naming his organization the China Youth Anti-Japanese Eradication of Traitors Special Service Team, in order to appeal to the public and provide cover. Liu Lu-yin, using his authority as a Standing Committee member of the People's Movement Committee, approved the plan with the words "Monthly approval of 2,000 yuan, to be remitted by Ru Yun," (see Evidence No. 1). After the plan was approved, Yang Xiao-ming immediately summoned the fugitives Xiao Zhun (also known as Xiao Pei-wei), Fan Qi-shu, Liang Jiu-bao, and the defendants Yang Qi-xin (Yang Xiao-ming's younger cousin) and Gong Bo-zhou (Yang Xiao-ming's nephew, also known as Gong Bo-sheng, Gong Shao-xian, Long Ding), to actively proceed according to Liu Lu-yin's approved plan, and ordered team member Li Qun-jian to participate in communications work. In May of the same year, Yang Qi-xin and Gong Bo-zhou, at the behest of Xiao Zhun, went to Lushan to investigate Chairman Chiang's whereabouts. Considering that Guanyin Bridge was located in a remote area, making it convenient for sniping, Yang Qi-xin reported to Xiao Zhun (see the confessions of Yang Qi-xin and Gong Bo-zhou). In August, Yang Xiao-ming summoned Yang Qi-xin and Gong Bo-zhou to Shanghai and instructed them to return to Nanjing to investigate the whereabouts of former Foreign Minister Zhang Qun. He gave Gong Bo-zhou 70 yuan to buy a gun and go to Hankou to assassinate Chairman Yang. After Yang Qi-xin returned to Nanjing, he and Gong Bo-zhou conducted one joint investigation and two independent investigations. They believed that the location of the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse was suitable for an attack and informed Yang Xiao-ming to prepare for the assassination. Gong Bo-zhou purchased a pistol in Nanjing and brought it to Hankou for use. At that time, in September, Yang Xiao-ming had arrived in Hankou in advance, using the alias Xu Chao, and was living separately with Xiao Zhun, Fan Qi-shu, Liang Jiu-bao, and Cao Bing-rong (also known as Zhang Jia-yi) at No. 39 Sanjiao Street and the Xintai'an Inn. At that time, Fan Youcheng Xie-chao (also known as Tan Wen-xin, Tan Rong-xuan, Cheng Da) was also in Hankou and met Fan. Fan knew that Cheng was violent and capable of taking action and instigated him to join the assassination organization, taking on the responsibility of implementation and handing over a pistol he had privately purchased in July to Cheng Xie-chao for use. Yang Xiao-ming presided over everything, secretly providing photographs of Chairman Yang to the assassins for identification. Initially, Liang Jiu-bao was sent to the road on Sandao Street in Wuchang, which Chairman Yang was bound to pass through, to try to obstruct traffic when Chairman Yang passed by, so that Cheng Xie-chao and Gong Bo-zhou could take the opportunity to shoot. This was done twice in a row, but both times they hesitated and did not carry it out. They then changed to waiting on the road near the Provincial Government, but because of the strict security, it was difficult to attack. They then changed to the wharf on the riverside in Hankou to await an opportunity. On the morning of October 25, Yang Xiao-ming and Cao Bing-rong came to Wuchang to find out that Chairman Yang would be attending a banquet in Hankou, which would take two to three hours. They then followed Yang and, after the boat arrived at the Hankou bank, Yang Xiao-ming immediately ordered Cao Bing-rong to stand at the People's Question Office as a marker. On one side he returned to the Xintai'an Inn and ordered Cheng Xie-chao and Gong Bo-zhou to hold loaded pistols and wait at a wharf, secretly supervising and directing the scene. After three bell rings, Chairman Yang drove up and got out of the car and walked several steps. Cheng Xie-chao immediately approached from behind, pulled out his gun, and fired two shots at his back. Chairman Yang was caught off guard, and both bullets hit vital points. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he died soon after. Cheng Xie-chao was arrested on the spot. Liu Lu-yin, Gong Bo-zhou, Cao Bing-rong, Yang Qi-xin, Li Qun-jian, and others were also arrested in Yanhubeijing and Shanghai. The Hubei High Court ordered this court to investigate.

### Sichuan Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Disaster Areas for Relief Distribution

Secretary-General Deng Convenes Relief Personnel for Discussion, Elaborating on Relief Methods and Highlighting Key Points

Chengdu Correspondence: After Chairman Zhu Ziqiao of the Relief Committee came to Sichuan, he has been consulting with Chairman Liu Fucheng for days regarding disaster relief. It has now been decided to select the 26 most severely affected counties and the 46 next most severely affected counties from the 140 disaster-stricken counties in the province. Initially, 2 million yuan will be allocated, comprising 1 million yuan from the central government and 1 million yuan raised by the provincial government. The remaining funds will be reserved to supplement relief efforts in other counties. Meanwhile, investigators will be dispatched to various counties to verify the disaster situation and distribute relief tickets in accordance with the Relief Association's investigation and distribution regulations. Secretary-General Deng Mingjie of the Provincial Government convened a meeting with the investigators before their departure. He spoke in great detail about the disaster situation in the province and the relief measures. The gist of his remarks is recorded below:

A Bad Harvest Follows Great Disorder

"Gentlemen, you are about to depart for the disaster areas to investigate and distribute urgent relief. Your task is exceptionally important. Wherever you go, you must ensure that officials, gentry, and the common people alike are fully aware of the government's determination to thoroughly rescue the people, as well as their own responsibilities. Only through joint efforts can we achieve success. I will briefly outline the main points. A bad harvest inevitably follows great disorder. This saying from the ancients is derived from experience. When the bandits were defeated last year and the military campaign to suppress them came to an end, the heads of various departments of the provincial government, under the leadership of Chairman Liu, handled the aftermath. They had already recognized that Sichuan farmers, after more than a decade of devastation, had no stored grain at home and were struggling to survive. Therefore, they actively promoted beneficial measures, such as repairing warehouses to regulate grain supply, promoting cooperation, establishing a disaster relief reserve fund management committee, assisting the Provincial Relief Association, supervising charitable organizations in cities and counties, and improving local relief homes. These were all included in the administrative outline for the 25th year. Furthermore, they actively promoted production and construction, aiming to ensure that all 70 million people could have ample food and clothing and be able to withstand natural disasters even if they occurred. For example, they completed the measurement of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System to benefit farmland irrigation, established meteorological stations to determine rainfall, completed hydrological stations to centralize water level reports, and simultaneously improved rice and wheat varieties, tested late rice, paddy rice, double-cropping rice, improved silkworm breeds, tested cotton cultivation, and improved sugarcane, tung oil, citrus fruits, and various other crops. In addition, there were preparations for the development of animal husbandry, forestry, and minerals. These were also included in the administrative outline for the 25th year and implemented step by step. The above measures were the responsibilities that the government should fulfill, as the ancients said, 'A bad harvest inevitably follows disorder,' and we had to think about prevention in advance. The original intention was to enable the people to live and work in peace and restore their long-damaged vitality. Unexpectedly, Heaven has not yet ended its disasters and has once again dealt a severe blow to the people of Sichuan. Last year's autumn drought and this year's spring famine have already caused great suffering to the people, and the recent shortage of rainfall makes this year's autumn harvest not very reliable. If such a major disaster occurred in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, where transportation is convenient, it would not be difficult to provide a steady stream of relief. However, we now face financial difficulties and inconvenient transportation. For example, the grain purchased in Wuhu and other places has not yet been fully repaid. Therefore, it is truly difficult for Sichuan today to raise large sums of money and purchase large quantities of grain for distribution and price stabilization. However, the government's duty is to do what is right, and conscience drives us. How dare we be daunted by difficulties? We will exhaust every possible means to plan and implement measures to provide relief and overcome this difficult situation. I will briefly discuss with you what we have learned. According to formal reports from various associations, a total of 140 counties in the province have been affected by the disaster. Among them, the severely affected counties, which should be given priority, include Qijiang, Nanxi, Jiang'an, and Hejiang, totaling 26 counties. The next most severely affected counties are Neijiang, Rongxian, Renshou, and Weiyuan, totaling 46 counties. The lightly affected counties are Wenjiang and Huayang, totaling 68 counties. According to recent surveys and statistics, the 26 most severely affected counties have approximately 6 million disaster victims, and the 46 next most severely affected counties have approximately 13 million disaster victims. Statistics for the 68 lightly affected counties have not yet been compiled, but it is feared that they will also be no less than 10 million. In total, the province has over 30 million disaster victims. Among them, those capable of working, based on the number of able-bodied men, are only over 4.6 million. However, there must be quite a few people other than able-bodied men who can work. According to the report of the personnel sent by the Provincial Food Survey Association to inspect 35 counties including Xuanhan and Jiang'an, the grain reserves in each county are at most sufficient for two months. The grain shortage before the autumn harvest is about 50,000 to 60,000 dan per county, and it is difficult for grain from outside to enter the area. The starving people are unable to afford to buy food. If this year's autumn harvest is also poor, the future will be unimaginable.

Government Initiatives

The government's disaster relief initiatives include: ❶ Urgent relief: The Provincial Relief Association has allocated 140,000 yuan from this year's initial disaster relief reserve fund to the severely affected counties for urgent relief to the elderly and weak. The 1 million yuan in government bonds allocated by the central government, after being discounted to 700,000 yuan, along with the 1 million yuan raised by the provincial government, will all be used for urgent relief, with personnel dispatched to various counties to investigate and distribute the funds. ❷ Agricultural loans: The Provincial Cooperative Treasury has allocated 1 million yuan to handle emergency relief in the severely and next most severely affected counties, organizing preparatory cooperatives to provide loans to farmers. The Joint Committee can allocate another 2 million yuan for this purpose. Furthermore, to stabilize rural areas as a fundamental solution to the disaster, a special request has been made to issue 12 million yuan in provincial government bonds, which can be mortgaged for 6 million yuan in cash. After using 1 million yuan to make up for the shortfall in urgent relief, the remaining 5 million yuan will be used as a special fund to promote agricultural loans in the disaster-stricken counties and to subsidize the insufficient funding for local public works projects in various counties. Furthermore, since the loans are still limited, the Provincial Council has resolved that the provincial government will be responsible for guaranteeing loans to rural areas in the disaster-stricken areas from major banks inside and outside the province, with a total amount of 12 million yuan. ❸ Grain exemption: Based on the number of severely affected counties that reached the disaster threshold after last year's autumn harvest, the provincial government sent personnel to investigate the results and, as of the end of March, approved the exemption of nearly 2 million yuan in grain taxes. The remaining amount is still under review, and it is estimated that the total amount of grain tax exemption will reach about 5 to 6 million yuan. ❹ Tax deferral: The provincial government, recognizing that disaster victims are currently unable to pay grain taxes, has issued a special order to the disaster-stricken counties to suspend the collection of grain taxes in the months of May, June, July, and August of this year to alleviate the people's burden. ❺ Price stabilization: To regulate the food supply, the provincial government has borrowed 3 million yuan from the Bank of China and 2 million yuan from the financial community in Chongqing to purchase rice from outside the province, which will be transported to Sichuan in batches for the counties to purchase for price stabilization. Other counties have raised funds on their own to handle price stabilization, totaling no less than 3 million yuan. ❻ Public works relief: In addition to instructing the county governments to order the district and baojia chiefs to supervise the able-bodied disaster victims to engage in the construction of ponds and dikes, with the owners providing food, or to repair roads and dredge rivers, with the local area providing food, Chairman Liu has also decided to allocate 4.2 million yuan from the construction bond project for public works relief, including the reorganization of the Zhilong section of the Sichuan-Yunnan Road and the Jianqu section of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road. The more than 1.39 million yuan allocated for food for the laborers is part of this fund. After the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway begins, the labor cost is estimated at 4 million yuan. The reconstruction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway via the northern route has been negotiated with the railway company for a subsidy of 600,000 yuan, all of which will be used for public works relief. ❼ Sheltering the elderly and weak: The provincial government has issued an order to the disaster-stricken counties to establish shelters for orphans and helpless children and the elderly and disabled among the disaster victims, with the county governments raising funds to operate them and the provincial government providing appropriate subsidies. ❽ Donating salaries for relief: The provincial government stipulates that civil servants will donate salaries for relief. The measures are as follows: A. Appointed officials and commissioned positions will donate one day's income. B. Appointed officials will donate two days' income. C. Senior officials will donate three days' income. The military is ordered to follow suit. Regarding the military, the Pacification Headquarters has also issued an order that lieutenants donate one day's income, field officers donate two days' income, and generals donate three days' income. Once the donations are collected, they will be sent to the relief organizations for distribution.

Other Effective Methods

As for other effective methods, the provincial government has issued orders to implement the following: ❶ Each county should form a joint guarantee and establish a temporary relief branch to investigate families with surplus resources and lend money and grain to nearby disaster victims, to be repaid at harvest time. ❷ Funds from ancestral halls and temples should be appropriately allocated for loans, prioritizing relatives and then neighbors. ❸ Local non-essential public funds should be diverted for relief. ❹ Technicians in each county should work hard to combat drought, going to the countryside from time to time to explain drought-resistant methods and teach drought-resistant farming techniques, etc. Chairman Liu has exhausted his efforts to raise and lend funds, as mentioned above. However, considering the extent of the disaster area at present, the effectiveness of relief is still limited. It is still hoped that local officials and gentry will find ways to help themselves, raising public and private funds for relief. In addition, they should solicit donations from various sources, accumulating small amounts to make a large sum, to expand relief efforts. The above is just a brief overview of the main points. Gentlemen, when you arrive in the disaster areas, you must widely publicize this information so that everyone is aware. As for the precautions for investigating the disaster, there is a separate document issued to you for your reference, so I will not elaborate further."

### Ancient Artifacts from the Han Dynasty Continuously Unearthed in Zhaotong County, Yunnan Province

Gold, Stone, and Bronze Artifacts are all Famous Masterpieces

Zhaotong Correspondence: Zhaotong County is a major county in eastern Yunnan, bordering Sichuan to the north, and receiving Central Plains culture the earliest. Therefore, in the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, the Han Dynasty Meng Xiaoju Stele was discovered there, which is one of the few ancient inscriptions in the country. Several years ago, archaeologist Zhang Xilu also discovered the "Yangjia Second Year, Qiongdu Made" Double Fish Washer and Han Steamer from the Eastern Han Dynasty under Emperor Shun. "Qiongdu" is recorded in the "Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies of the Southwestern Barbarians," which proves the early culture of the area.

Zhang Xilu, who roams the country, has a good understanding of antiquities. This spring, he arrived in Zhaotong and often said that antiquities are closely related to culture and should be collected and preserved at any time to promote local cultural relics. Lin Fa, a gardener at the local People's Education Hall, heard Zhang's words. When he returned to his village, Caojia Laobao (a village name, eight miles east of Zhaotong City), he dug up a pile of beams and discovered a right-angled stone. The entire piece was painted with vermilion. He washed it and ran to tell Mr. Zhang with an expression of remorse, saying that he originally wanted to dig up some ancient coins to give as a gift, but unexpectedly found nothing of value. Zhang said that since no coins were found, the stone was also needed. So he hired someone to bring it over. It turned out to be a statue inscription from the Han Dynasty. A crane was carved on the back, a tortoise and snake on the left, and a phoenix on the right. On the front are the nine characters "Made in the Wuzi Year of the Third Month of Jianchu Nine Years." The characters are one inch in diameter and in the Han official script. The character "year" has been more than half peeled off. According to Emperor Zhang of the Han Dynasty, "Jianchu" only lasted for eight years, and the following year the era name was changed to "Yuanhe." Using the "Biography of Emperor Zhang" in the Later Han Dynasty, the stems and branches in February and April of the first year of Yuanhe advanced, and there was indeed "Wuzi" in March. Probably the news of the change of era name by Emperor Zhang to "Yuanhe" was delayed due to the distance. The record of the Xiaocuan Stele in the eighth year is also the same mistake. The inscription is a square solid slanted upwards, with a height of 1.65 Yingzao chi, each side 8.5 cun, three lines of characters with three characters in each line. A hole is drilled at the top. According to the gardener's own description, a bronze Buddha statue with a handle was unearthed there several years ago, which could be inserted into the hole in this stone. Then this inscription is the seat of a Buddha statue from the Han Dynasty, which proves that Buddhism spread to Yunnan, China, very early, and may have entered China from India through southern Yunnan. This remains to be proven by subsequent antiquities.

After Mr. Zhang examined it, he went to Caojia Laobao to inspect it himself and ordered the gardener to continue digging down a foot or so. Under the Han Dynasty flower brick wall, he discovered a Han Dynasty Five-Zhu Flower Tree Coin, with the fruits between the stems and leaves all in the shape of Five-Zhu Coins. The copper has turned entirely clumsy green, with some corrosion and peeling off, but it is quaint and charming. It is an ancient artifact that has never been recorded by epigraphers. From this, one can imagine that the craftsmanship of the Han Dynasty in Yunnan had reached sophistication. The unearthed artifact immediately shocked people throughout the city, who came to borrow it for viewing. Mr. Zhang exhausted his savings in Caojia Laobao to study it. He successively discovered the Han Jianchu Zhuti Double Fish Device and Insect and Fish Device. The two devices weigh about twenty-odd jins each and are extremely strange and ancient in shape. They were unearthed from the same hole at the same time. One device has an inscription with characters such as "Made in Zhuti in Jianchu..." The seal script Yang Wen examines "Zhuti", which is the ancient name of Zhaotong County, which has been seen in various books such as the Book of the Former and Later Han Dynasty Water Classic Commentary. "Jianchu" is also the era name of Emperor Zhang of the Han Dynasty, and like the previous stone, it occupies the first place among Yunnan's antiquities, breaking all previous records of Yunnan's antiquities, which is enough to add luster to the culture of the Southwest. The device without inscription has two fish sandwiched between an insect in the middle and is relatively large. It was unearthed from the same hole as the previous device and should undoubtedly be a Jianchu object. Moreover, its copper quality and production are also very similar. He also discovered many Han Dynasty bronze artifacts of various sizes. "A Han Nanyi Chief's Seal" and "A Han Fish Washer" are all valuable items. The Han Dynasty flower brick wall in Caojia Laobao spans hundreds of blocks horizontally and vertically. Mr. Zhang persuaded the villagers not to move it and to preserve it for visitors from China and abroad to visit and study. As for the scattered antiquities and broken bricks, they were transported to Zhaotong Provincial Middle School in the city to prepare for the future fundraising and display. As for photos or rubbings of this antiquity, if anyone seeks them, they can write to Mr. Zhang at Zhaotong Middle School, Yunnan.

### Suzhou

Planning to Build the Su-Dong Road

Dongting East Mountain is an important town in the western countryside of Wuxian County, with abundant agricultural products and a relatively developed commercial sector. Unfortunately, transportation is not very convenient. Now, Wang Shujie, Fan Junbo, and more than 30 others have jointly initiated the construction of the Su-Dong Highway. They once had an informal discussion and decided to proceed with the plan. The highway will start from the Suzhou City Railway Station, pass through Mudu, Ducun, and Hengjing, and reach Dongting East Mountain. The entire road is about 90 Chinese li. Except for the section from Suzhou to Mudu, which has been built by the Su-Fu Company and is accessible to public buses, the section from Mudu to East Mountain, which is about 50 li, requires more than 100,000 yuan. The initiators have scheduled a meeting of the initiators at 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 8th) at the Farmer's Building on Guanqian Street to discuss the direction of progress.

Large-Scale Air Defense Drill in the City

The county government held a large-scale air defense drill. On the afternoon of the 4th, an inspection was first held at the sports field, with more than 3,000 participants. At about 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, the bell rang to issue an air raid alert. The traffic team implemented traffic control, and all shops closed immediately.

All agencies, schools, groups, and baojia chiefs participated in this drill. The people of the county had suffered from enemy bombing, so they were very excited. Although it was a hypothetical drill, their spirit was very full.

Causes and Consequences of the Sand Field Dispute

The sand field dispute in Shazhou City has recently resulted in another armed fight. Both sides are currently seeking legal solutions, but the causes of the dispute are extremely complex. According to those familiar with the sand field situation, in 1920, Xue Xian'de, a giant Jiangyin dye merchant, reported to the Sand Field Bureau that he had obtained 26,000 mu of滩地 to organize the Houde Company. In 1922, the Fuli Company reported to the Sand Field Bureau that it had obtained more than 100,000 mu of Nanjia灘地. According to custom, the Fuli Company could only build after the Houde Company had completed the construction. Later, to avoid disputes, the two parties signed a non-infringement treaty, with a 3:1 profit split. Over the past decade or so, the Fuli Company has built more than 40,000 mu through Qian Yumen's enclosure, while Houde has only received several hundred mu, a huge difference. This spring, Houde hired workers from the Xinji Construction Company to enclose the area themselves. Then Rong Desheng, a Wuxi giant merchant and director of Fuli, intervened to mediate, and the two parties still handled the matter according to the previous agreement. It could have proceeded peacefully, but internal disputes arose within the Fuli Company. The former director, Qian Yumen, opposed the previous agreement and tried his best to grab the enclosure, causing the Fuli Company to be divided into old and new factions, which led to the bloody tragedy on the 27th of last month.

Civilian Armed Fight in Cixi Township

For days, the villagers in the western townships of Cixi have been welcoming the Saining Hui and Dongyue Hui festivals. Among them, the villagers of Sujia Village near Shushan and the villagers of Xianchi Village had long had a grudge because of the Dongyue Hui festival in the past. At first, they cursed each other, then they pushed and trampled each other, and finally, both sides used dragon-footed wooden sticks, flagpoles, and copper-tin staffs as weapons to engage in a fierce fight. There were five or six hundred people on each side, and the order was in chaos. Then the Changjing Police Station of the Zhangting Public Security Bureau led the police to rush to mediate, which lasted for two hours before they persuaded them to separate. Each side suffered five or six seriously injured people whose lives were in danger. They have each requested the county government to investigate the injuries and punish the murderers. In addition, after the Xinyangshan Hui, Guanhaiwei in northern Cixi also greatly welcomed the festival. The other day, when they welcomed it to Tangjia Bridge in Shenshi Bridge, gunmen from the Xiafang Gang and the Hongjia Gang suddenly clashed for some unknown reason, each holding iron guns and shooting randomly at people, injuring more than a dozen people. Among them, one from the Xiafang Gang had his eyeball shot out, and his injury was very serious.

### The German-Italian Military Agreement Becomes a Mystery in the European Situation

One Says Principles Have Been Set, Germany Still Denies. Austria and Czechoslovakia Will Move Towards London

[Rome] German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Rome has ended today. Neurath firmly denied any military alliance between Italy and Germany. It is heard that Neurath had a long discussion with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano about the overall situation in Spain. It is now believed that both the Italian and German governments are willing to withdraw their volunteer soldiers from Spain, and plan to withdraw them when it does not damage their prestige. It is said that this opportunity may come when the Nationalist army captures Bilbao. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 6th)

[Paris] Diplomatic circles here learned today that Germany and Italy have reached a military agreement in principle. From now on, Germany can act freely in Austria, but must guarantee never to invade the Italian border at the Brenner Pass. The French side believes that Italy's move has recognized the economic merger of Germany and Austria. It is claimed that Austria has learned the contents of the agreement, but hopes that Britain and France can re-declare and guarantee the territorial integrity of Austria. The above agreement was negotiated by German Aviation Minister General Göring and Foreign Minister Neurath with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano. If German Army Minister von Blomberg does not personally go to Italy, he may send a senior staff officer as a representative to Rome to draft the provisions of the agreement. (National News, 5th)

[London] As King George VI holds the coronation ceremony, Central European countries will send important envoys to congratulate him. It is generally expected that Foreign Minister Eden will take the opportunity to conduct important talks with Czech Prime Minister Hodža, Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt, and Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul. It is heard that Hodža and Schmidt have raised a question to the British government, asking for a clear answer, that is, what attitude will Britain take regarding the current encroachment of German forces into Central European countries? Are the Western European democracies more concerned about the fate of Austria and Czechoslovakia than before, or will they sit idly by as the political axis organized by Germany and Italy leads the Central European countries and ignores them? All these are what Austria and Czechoslovakia want to know. It is also heard that Czech Prime Minister Hodža will be the central figure in these informal talks and will put forward the so-called "Hodža Plan," the purpose of which is to seek economic cooperation among the countries in the Danube River basin. This economic cooperation does not exclude Germany and Italy, but it does not allow each country to control the countries participating in the future Danube Agreement. In addition, well-informed sources also believe that after Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt comes to London, he may ask Britain and France to issue a joint declaration on the issue of Austrian independence.

### Business Investigation of China Vegetable Oil Factory

Minister Wu Visited Shanghai to Inspect, Total Trade Volume Reached 10 Million Yuan

My country's exports of vegetable oil and materials last year were estimated at 150 million yuan, which is of great importance to the rural economy. The China Vegetable Oil Factory Co., Ltd., jointly operated by the Ministry of Industry and the official and commercial sectors of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, has a total capital of 2 million yuan, specializing in promoting the improvement of the quality, transportation, and sales of my country's oil production. Since its establishment last autumn, it has made rapid progress.

A total of three oil pool factories have been established in Shanghai, Hankou, and Wanxian, specializing in acting as agents for merchants to chemically test, store, and refine various oils, and issue warehouse receipts for transfers and pledges. In the past half year, the local oil merchants' finances have been adjusted, which has been highly praised. Five factories in Wuhu, Changsha, Changde, Chongqing, and Hangzhou are under construction and will be completed in early autumn this year. Appropriate for the oil season, business offices have been established in Shanghai, Hankou, Changsha, Changde, Wuhu, Chenzhou, Qu County, Chongqing, Wanxian, Yichang, Shashi, Wenzhou, and other places, undertaking convenient sales affairs for merchants. In the past half year, the total turnover is said to be nearly 10 million yuan. The oils directly exported to foreign countries include tung oil, tea oil, cottonseed oil, pine oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, and various oil cakes. Recently, it has also been actively promoting the use of machines to press tung oil. Although this move has been promoted domestically in recent years, it has been limited to written suggestions or small-scale research in chemical laboratories. Now, after large-scale trials by the factory, machine pressing can save 2 yuan and 48 cents per load compared with local soil pressing. The first machine-pressed tung oil has been shipped to the United States. The quality is similar to the tung oil pressed by machines from tung seeds grown in the United States. The price is also higher than that of ordinary tung oil in my country due to its excellent quality. According to the original purpose of the Ministry of Industry in establishing the factory, exported tung oil is divided into four grades according to the quality, which is more scientific than the ordinary exported tung oil with water, impurities, and no grade separation. In the future, my country's tung oil will surely be more welcomed overseas, and gradually eliminate the move of the United States to grow tung trees itself. In addition to tung oil, it is also actively paying attention to promoting other special agricultural vegetable oils in my country. For example, tea oil was exported for about 1.5 million yuan last year. The factory recently invented a simple method of testing tea oil to teach merchants in various places to conduct their own tests when purchasing. The reason is that due to the Spanish Civil War last year, the export of olive oil was reduced, so the export of tea oil was quite prosperous and the price was relatively high. However, the bad habits of merchants have been revived, and other oils are added to seek profits. The testing method is easy to implement and is a good way to ensure the quality of tea oil. The factory currently has three kinds of oil pressing machines purchased from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom for comparative research, and plans to design its own suitable oil pressing machine after the trial. The reason is that European, American, and Japanese countries have no production of tung oil and tea oil, so it is inevitable that there will be some separation. Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry visited the factory at 8:00 a.m. on April 23 when he came to Shanghai a few days ago. Yu Jianqiu, the managing director and director of the Hunan Construction Department, also came to Shanghai a few days ago to visit the factory, and both praised it highly. Recently, the factory held the second meeting of the Standing Committee in the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing on May 4, reporting the work that has been done in the past six months and the goals to be promoted in the future. In addition, Juxingcheng Trading Department, the only Chinese merchant tung oil export organization in my country, has a long history and has decided to cooperate with the factory in a practical manner. It is also heard that Yang Jijun, the manager of the department, has been hired as the assistant manager by the factory's Standing Committee a few days ago to preside over the tung oil business affairs.

### General Labor Union Issues Order for Caution in Strikes and Slowdowns

The General Labor Union of this city issued a document to the municipal labor unions under its jurisdiction yesterday, stating that in order to comply with the order, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters Executive Committee issued an instruction, No. 2829, which stated that the Central Executive Committee's Public Training Department issued a letter, No. 7100, which stated that in the event of labor-management disputes, there shall be no threats of suspension of work or strikes until after mediation has failed, so as not to cause harm to both labor and management. In addition to separate letters, please handle accordingly, etc. Accordingly, recently in this city there have been labor disputes one after another, both labor and management have been harmed, which not only affects the national economy, but also the social order. As such, there should be an immediate stop to such disputes, in the future for labor-management disputes, labor is not allowed to undertake a strike or work slowdown until after legal mediation has failed, and management is even more forbidden to shut down businesses or fire laborers without reason, causing a repeat of the disputes. Aside from issuing an order to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for them to observe the order, we hasten to issue an order so that all under jurisdiction of the union should observe and not disobey.” As such, labor-management cooperation, increased production, and ethnic revitilization must be an important part of the movement, as this city is the national economic hub. The prosperity of the industrial and commercial trades heavily influences national economic development, and we can not let labor-management disputes run rampant, and allow that harm befall the national people. The preceding order has been separately issued, and as such we hasten to issue an order so that all under jurisdiction of the union should observe and not disobey.”

### Address by Madame Chiang at the Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council

May the New Life Movement Cooperate with the Church and Advance

The 11th Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council of China held its first session yesterday morning at the New Asia Restaurant. Over a hundred representatives attended. The meeting was chaired by President Dr. Wu Yifang, and Vice President Dr. Liu Zhansi. The General Secretary of the Council, Chen Wenyuan, delivered a speech entitled "The Transformation of the Times and the Christian Movement." In the afternoon, the meeting was divided into four groups for discussion. The first group discussed "The Life of Christianity in a Changing Era," the second group discussed "Christian Ministry," the third group discussed "Cooperation," and the fourth group discussed "Christian Relations," which included discussions about the New Life Movement. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. In the evening, Madame Chiang Song Meiling, Director of the Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement, delivered a speech. Her speech was read aloud by Dr. Wu Yifang, President of the Council and Director of the Women's Group of the New Life Movement Promotion Association. The original text is as follows:

What society hopes from the Church is that it can solve the pressing problems of the present. If the social atmosphere is filled with a poisonous and turbid environment, then a strong religious faith will not only protect believers like a gas mask, shielding them from the invasion of the poisonous atmosphere, but will also blow away the turbid atmosphere like a fresh breeze from the sky, clearing the heavens for the masses to live in peace. We are gathered here today to discuss the relationship between the Church and the current environment in China, so that we may be alerted that the Church should no longer be isolated and independent from the development of modern China. The whole of China is now on the road to progress, and the Church should accompany it and advance together, knowing that we must fight against deeply rooted social evils and pave the way for a bright future in the new era. The New Life Movement in China, like the rising sun, is sounding its clear horn.

1.  A Call to Advance and Endure

Those who criticize the New Life Movement often say, "The most pressing problem for the masses is livelihood, but the New Life Movement has not made efforts in this regard." I offer this comment to you and share the responsibility with you. I recall that in the summer of 1933, I was invited to participate in a discussion held in Guling to study Christianity and Communism. At that time, I found that Christians discussed the issue of livelihood from a purely academic standpoint. I immediately felt the need to take practical action in the practice of our faith. Subsequently, the National Christian Council cooperated with the government to organize eleven rural experimental districts in Jiangxi, enabling young men and women from church schools and other schools to lead and study the most pressing problems of ordinary farmers. The Committee Chairman and I will never forget that the Church can cooperate with us in managing the work of revitalizing and recovering the bandit areas. I hope that this will be the starting point for a large-scale movement to improve the lives of the people, and that in the future it will be further developed and achieve even more impressive results.

The main reason why the Church is slow to participate in the rural revival movement may be due to the difficulty of this work. When we are in this situation, we should frankly admit that the virtues of endurance and hard work of Christian warriors are not what we are accustomed to, and this especially exposes our shortcomings of weakness and incompetence. As the prophet King said, "I am at ease in Jerusalem." When I accompanied my husband on his travels through the provinces, I encountered devout Christians living in remote rural areas, and those who came into contact with them were moved by a sense of new life. At that time, I was deeply surprised that there was no shortage of talented Chinese men and women with modern education, but I had not seen anyone go to those remote areas to carry out the same work, nor could I find anyone to assist those male missionaries from the sidelines. Is it that Chinese Christians with modern training are not as naturally gifted as others? Or do we only know how to accept the benefits of religious belief and are unwilling to bear this arduous responsibility? We should know that at the core of our faith is the symbol of hardship, endurance, and tribulation, which is the cross. If we lack this virtue, what Christian faith can we speak of? I once heard the Committee Chairman say that Christ, as a young man, was willing to sacrifice his life for the sake of righteousness. If we cannot follow and emulate him, how can we solve all the major problems of the present? This is why the Committee Chairman believes that Christianity is a revolutionary religion, and that all those who have religious faith today should be revolutionaries.

If what I say is correct and is welcomed by you, then today's meeting should study whether we should prepare to be soldiers fighting for Jesus Christ, abandon the tedious work in the distant rear, and throw ourselves into the bloody battle in the forefront of the battlefield. In today's difficult era, human and national strength are subjected to extreme trials, and the strong Christian spirit warns us that we should have the perseverance to overcome all difficulties. The transformation of the times depends on the proportion to which we can inject our faith, personality, and enthusiasm into it to promote it. I measure the effectiveness of a drug by the size of its effect to test its goodness or badness. We should also measure the truth or falsehood of our faith by the impact it has on ourselves and society. Today, we must firmly hear the sound of God's calling, and immediately make a decision to sacrifice our lives without hesitation, let alone the comfort of life.

Knowledge and action are inseparable, and we are indeed commissioned to turn faith into action. China today is like someone who has just awakened from a deep sleep, looking around in surprise at how easily its environment has changed. In this new environment, if the Church can advance through hardship, it will surely occupy an important position.

2.  The New Life Movement as a Call to Close Cooperation

The Christian faith is not only a social creed, but also a manifestation of God. What is meant by manifestation must have its essence. In today's terms, what God wants to show us is the needs of society and what kind of active contribution we should make to society. May the backward churches in the East and the advanced churches in the West work together to create a new life foundation for the residents of cities and towns. Trees bear fruit in response to the call of the seasons, and fields bear ears of grain in response to the call of the seasons. The new China will also make a bright contribution in response to the call of seasonal cooperation from Western churches. I would like to extend my husband and my sincere invitation to Western churches to participate in the New Life Movement and work in closer cooperation.

In terms of current cooperation between the Church and the government, the achievements in Jiangxi can serve as a model. Under the leadership of Zhang Fuliang, a director of the National Christian Council, Lichuan and ten other experimental districts have been organized and established one after another. The other ten districts are managed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, while Lichuan is independent. However, those who go to Lichuan say that its achievements are no different from those of the other ten districts. In fact, Lichuan and the other ten districts are all making efforts to revive under the same leadership with the Christian spirit of service. How can there be any difference to be found? What is more noteworthy is that when we work to revive the lives of farmers in Lichuan and the other ten districts, we have a special Christian spirit. Our aim is to find effective solutions so that those who work for the welfare of the people can adopt and follow them. The Church is even more enthusiastic about lending its talents to participate in this great work of rural revival. Because its scope is so broad, our efforts today are but a drop in the ocean. The rural areas of Jiangxi after the war are extremely desolate. If they can be given a new life, it will truly be the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven. In addition, what is sufficient to symbolize the cooperation between the Church and the government is the national health undertaking. The earliest established health organization in China was the Health Education Association, which has been carrying out its work under the management of Christianity for many years. Although the work of this organization has now been largely taken over by the government, there is much that the Church and church hospitals can contribute to the national health plan. It is said that the Christian Youth Association has a medical director who is dedicated to promoting this cooperation, which is what we are very pleased about. This spring, the Department of Health prepared 4,000 dozen cowpox vaccines for use in rural areas. It asked its medical advisor, Mrs. Mousse Boer, to request the assistance of the New Life Movement Association, which agreed with the New Life Movement in several provinces to obtain the cooperation of local church hospitals, schools, and rural churches to promote the four-village vaccination movement. At present, the health authorities have not been able to complete their health care institutions in remote areas, so the Church's supplementing their inadequacies is also a good opportunity to serve the people. Currently, a quarter of the vaccine has been received and distributed for use in various places. Through the cooperation of the Department of Health, the New Life Movement Association, and hospitals, schools, and churches, more than 60,000 people have been vaccinated.

A women's prayer meeting was recently established in Guangzhou, with a membership of over 1,000. Each member prays daily with her family for China and its leaders. This is a special way to express patriotism, and its effect is enough to cultivate a strong spiritual unity. The New Life Movement hopes that all churches in the country will have this kind of prayer organization.

Zhang Jia'ao, Minister of Railways, has specially built a train car called "New Life on Wheels" to travel to major and minor cities along various lines to promote the New Life Movement. The car is equipped with film equipment and other visual education materials, so that it can be used anywhere in streets, government offices, halls, or churches. I hope that the churches you preside over will cooperate with it when the car arrives. For details, please contact the General Association of the New Life Movement in Nanjing as soon as possible.

All this cooperation does not require profound doctrines or sacred inspiration. Even with China's original old morality, sacrificing oneself and loving others, we should actively participate. People call Christianity a representative of material civilization, which is indeed an accurate judgment. The persistence and happiness of modern life are all based on various scientific inventions, and Christian countries are the source of these inventions. Although ancient physics made considerable contributions in countries such as Greece, it was the unique contribution of Christian countries that developed and expanded it and made it a common enjoyment for mankind. The import of modern life into China today is very rapid, and the Chinese people accept this life without hesitation. The Apostle Paul gave a solemn meaning to the material life of mankind when he said, "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit?" Then a happy material life should not be unique to a few, but should be shared by all. It is the inescapable responsibility of us Christians to spread this "New Life" among the people.

Wherever the Christian faith reaches, the status of women increases accordingly. Not long ago, church schools in the interior areas persuaded women to enroll and receive modern education, all free of charge, and even gave awards to encourage them. Their painstaking efforts are truly touching. Now these trained women are participating in various movements and improving the living conditions and status of their sisters in various provinces. Their faith formation has been concretized and manifested in action. May the New Life Movement and the Church also develop their spirit of cooperation in this area, seeking the improvement of the lives of women and children in villages and towns throughout the country. Knowing that the world's churches have abundant financial resources and many enthusiastic and capable young people, may we gather this financial and human resources and go together to meet the urgent needs of this era.

Xiong Shihui, Chairman of Jiangxi Province, is now promoting a large-scale movement to improve the lives of women and children throughout the province, under the guidance of Mrs. Zhu (daughter of Mr. Xiong Bing'er). The activities of this movement can mainly rely on the cooperation of the Church and various social movement organizations in the province. When Chairman Xiong was in Beiping last year, he asked several female professors from Yenching University to draft a plan to promote this movement, which is what he now calls the "triple cooperation plan." The so-called triple cooperation refers to: (1) cooperation with women with higher education, (2) cooperation with churches and social movement organizations that are already active in Jiangxi, and (3) cooperation with the Women's Committee of the New Life Movement Association. Therefore, Xiong has very high expectations for the Church's assistance in this struggle to increase the status of women and serve the country.

Commentators often believe that cooperation with the government rarely yields effective results. Even many of our countrymen hold this view. A certain important social service worker in a church in Nanchang was severely criticized by a colleague because of his long-term cooperation with the Women's New Life Movement Association in the province. However, we should know that cooperation and service after careful consideration will benefit all parties. The real benefit that the Church gains after participating in this movement is the increase in social knowledge and prosperity. For any society with increased knowledge and prosperity, the Church and the chapel will become indispensable institutions.

Previously, because of the urgent need for female talents with university education in the recovered bandit areas of Jiangxi, we asked Ginling Women's College to recommend candidates. Dr. Wu Yifang, President of the College (President of the Christian Council, who is also reading this article today), consulted with the faculty and staff of the College and selected several diligent and impartial graduates to go there. Now their service achievements have been praised by all there. Today we can tell you, "If Ginling recommends graduates to serve in rural areas, there is no need to investigate in depth, just send them immediately." Most of the schools run by Christianity have made significant contributions to promoting the New Life Movement among students, and their cost-saving management, excellent work achievements, and struggles in the environment of national crisis have all left a clear impression that is not easy to erase across the country. I hope that in education, we will not be complacent and become lazy, and we will not stop halfway. The Committee Chairman and I both believe that a rational life must have religious faith. Without religion, education is not complete. Today, all kinds of undertakings are in urgent need of leading talents, and they are in urgent need of talents with Christian service spirit and practical action.

The Young Men's and Women's Christian Associations are really at the forefront of leading talents. We have been subtly influenced by them for many years and deeply feel the need to change our way of life. The Young Men's and Women's Christian Associations have been very helpful in making young people yearn for the New Life.

We should know that Christ's emphasis on personality is not only in the realm of interest. He is deeply concerned about the welfare of society and cannot forget the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven. The so-called Kingdom of Heaven is where the righteousness and justice of all people are entrusted. The Chinese people have always valued personality. Their politeness and attention to "face" are often criticized by foreigners. Most of their lives are bound by habits and dominated by maintaining their bodies. If they can avoid it, they will never harm others. The ideal society we envision values "moderation," picking the middle ground over extremes. Therefore, a collectivist country is not what the Chinese people admire, because it annihilates the individual to enrich its country and tramples on personality to build its authority, which is not what the Chinese people like.

The New Life Movement resolutely rejects all forms of organization, because it runs counter to the late Premier's teachings and creates opportunities for those who harbor ulterior motives, disregard human rights, and take advantage of the situation to think of rebellion to oppress the people. The Chinese people have their own thoughts and will continue their intellectual activities. Only those who understand their culture, their justice, and feel their love for freedom can gain the cooperation of the Chinese people. There is a true meaning of new life in Chinese society, and what it needs is only guidance and religious faith. The foundation of the new China was built by its ancestors and cannot be replaced by various modern ideologies.

3.  The New Life Movement as a Call to Assist National Revival

The advancement of world events often gives people a sense of disappointment, but the Christian faith always gives us hope for national revival. The spirit of Christianity is neither a purely theological system of knowledge, nor what is generally called philosophy, but combines and broadens both, including the relationship between people and individual faith. Our responsibility today is to search for the points of contact between our faith and general life. The needs of the times are the guide for our vision.

Throughout history, God has always communicated with mankind through revelation and spiritual sensation, and through the mediation of his Holy Spirit, he has spiritual dialogue with us. When he speaks, we can perceive it, and reason and emotion can respond to it at the same time. Once we discover the need for revival and discover the tools to complete the grand revival, the trend of the times will be like the surging tide, and we will be carried away by it and cannot resist it. However, during its progress, we should understand the content of our work and gradually reach a state of thorough understanding.

Christ has two characteristics: his life is based on the common faith, and his faith has the power to move mountains. The future of building a new society is difficult and requires the assistance of these two characteristics. The New Life Movement requires us to practice the highest ideals of mankind, persevere in faith and move forward. Both individuals and society need active action, which is inherent in the Christian spirit.

In today's program, there is an item "The Church and its Relationship," and under this item, there is a sub-item of the New Life Movement, so I briefly describe my thoughts as my personal contribution to this issue.

Regarding the aforementioned section on national revival, I have a few more words to add. The changes in the lives of the Chinese people must be promoted in accordance with the steps prescribed by the late Premier, because the founder of the Republic of China was truly a perfect person with both faith and action. His soul burned with a passion to save the people from fire and water. He and our Lord were on different paths but had the same goal, which cannot be denied. Born of faith, died of faith, and now left this most important stage of completing the revolution to await our efforts. The most important thing in construction is the regeneration and improvement of the spiritual life of the people. The social life of the people has its own historical process of creation, which we cannot create, but we can improve it and infuse it with a new soul. The creation of Christian life is actually "a dramatic and permanent change in its spirit," which is generally called new life, "changing its principles of succession, changing its habits and state of life, and continuing its new type of life under the guidance of the Holy Spirit." This is the inner form of the New Life and the starting point of national revival. In a broad sense, this part of the construction is the work that the Church should undertake. May the New Life Movement and the Church cooperate to promote it.

### The Perpetrator of the Case of Japanese Ruffians Beating and Humiliating Customs Officers Apologized to the Customs Yesterday

A local solution was unsuccessful, and the Customs has reported to the Central Government.

The Shishi News Agency reports that when the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru entered port on the evening of the 24th of last month, customs inspectors Cao Ketong and Shen Huiren of the Jianghai Customs were severely beaten by Japanese ruffians at the Huishan Wharf. Afterwards, Robert Ford, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, immediately reported the incident to the Central Government and made representations to Yoshioka, the Acting Consul General of Japan in Shanghai. To date, the Japanese side has not yet responded. However, it is learned that the perpetrator, Shibata Kumeju, accompanied by personnel dispatched by the Japanese consulate, went to the Jianghai Customs yesterday afternoon and expressed his apologies to the beaten customs officers Cao and Shen in the office of Commissioner of Customs Robert Ford, in an attempt to resolve the case locally and to dismiss the five key points raised by the Customs. (Note: The five key points are 1. Stop illegal acts, 2. Punish the perpetrators, 3. Compensation, 4. Apology, and 5. Guarantee that the same incident will not occur again.) The Customs authorities have reported the circumstances to the Central Government and are awaiting instructions.

### Unprecedented Development of Northern Shipping

Unseen Since the September 18th Incident

After the September 18th Incident, Northern shipping was subjected to environmental pressures. Chinese merchant ships declined to the extreme. Illegal inspections and tonnage taxes in Yingkou, Andong, and other places made it impossible for Chinese ships to bear the exploitation, and they stopped sailing one after another, changing routes to various ports in the North. As a result, the number of ships in Tianjin, Yantai, Longkou, Qingdao, and other ports suddenly increased. However, most of the markets in the North were occupied by Japanese goods. Our country's goods were invisibly driven out, which affected shipping. Chinese shipping companies operating in the North were greatly impacted. Then, due to the proliferation of smuggled goods, some Chinese merchant ships stopped sailing due to losses, and some sold their ships and stopped operating. Until our country strictly cracked down on smuggling and sent warships to patrol the sea, the trend of smuggling gradually subsided. It was not until the second half of last year that the situation improved slightly, and domestic goods gradually began to be transported. This year, starting in April, the shipping situation in Shanghai changed. There were many goods in storage in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which led to stable transportation in recent times. The freight volume along the coast of the North has also suddenly increased. The congestion of goods going from Shanghai is not only rare since the September 18th Incident, but also only seen in the past ten years. Cotton yarn, cloth, silk, rice, flour, cigarettes, and domestic miscellaneous goods, hardware, electrical materials, etc., are all being shipped in large quantities, one after another. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, Osaka, Zhengji, China Merchants, Zhaoxing, and other shipping companies have sent large numbers of ships to sail. There are so many ships and goods that some cannot even secure the tonnage they need. As a result, passengers have situations of "competing for tonnage" and "scrambling for loading." The so-called "competing for tonnage" refers to, after buying the bill of lading, changing the number of goods by themselves, for example, changing 100 pieces of covers to 600 or 700 pieces. If the Customs finds out, they must be fined, so the passengers voluntarily pay the fine. "Scrambling for loading" refers to colluding with the dock foremen to try to get the goods unloaded first. Therefore, every ship going to Yantai and Tianjin is fully loaded. According to shipping companies, after the increase in freight rates in May, compared with three years ago, the freight income can be increased up to four times. Such development is truly rare. There are still many goods accumulated in Shanghai, especially rice and wheat flour, no less than 70,000 to 80,000 tons. All companies are adding large-tonnage temporary liners in addition to the regular sailings to sail the Northern route, competing to load goods to meet the needs of passengers.

### Alarming Development of Shanghai-Hong Kong Shipping

Japanese and North China-bound Ships Sailing South are Fully Loaded with Shanghai Goods and Cannot Load More

The Xinxin News Agency reports that, according to the latest North China Daily News, major mail ship companies operating between Hong Kong and overseas, in view of the recent booming transportation, held a meeting with various companies operating coastal shipping. All agreed that freight rates on other lines had already increased, so it was decided to increase freight rates between Hong Kong and Shanghai by 20%. According to this decision, the meeting implemented the current coastal freight rates accordingly. The reason for the increase is based on the booming trade around the world, the general increase in freight rates, and the consistent rise in various other rates. In the local area, because the tonnage for the transportation of rice and scrap metal often falls short of actual needs, there has also been a further increase in business. Taking scrap metal as an example, the freight rate from Hong Kong to Japan has increased from 8 yuan to 10 yuan. It has been learned that the general situation of the recent increase in freight rates from Hong Kong and other places is as follows: 10% increase to Japan, the Hong Kong Strait Colonies, and Calcutta, India, effective March 28; 15% increase from Hong Kong to Manila, effective March 1; 20% increase from Hong Kong to Australia, effective May 1; 15% increase from Hong Kong to Pacific ports, effective May 1; 33.3% (one third) increase from Hong Kong to the Strait Colonies for Chinese goods, effective December 1, 1936; 20% (one fifth) increase for foreign goods, effective March 1 of this year; 10% increase from Hong Kong to Calcutta, Madras, and Yangon, effective March 1; 20% increase from Hong Kong to Japan, effective March 1; 20% increase from Hong Kong to Shanghai, effective April 15. In addition, ships sailing south from Japan and North China passing through Hong Kong load their cargo holds as fully as possible, so that shippers in this port cannot load more goods, resulting in a standstill. In addition, those who make advance reservations cannot guarantee the required space, because in fact, when ships set sail from Japan and other ports in North China, they are loaded to full capacity, and cannot be reloaded after arriving in Shanghai.

### Yesterday's Tea Party at the Income Tax Bureau

Representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Others Invited

Our newspaper reports: The Municipal Income Tax Bureau held a tea party at its office at 4:00 PM yesterday, inviting the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, representatives from various exchanges, and brokers. Over twenty people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Mu Ouchu, Zhang Weiru, Gu Xinyi, Xu Yongzuo, Jin Runxiang, and Yan Esheng. Mr. Liang Hejun presided over the meeting. Regarding the issue of withholding income tax for exchange clients, the brokers had previously submitted the tax payments, but there were some questions about the calculation procedures, so the forms had not yet been submitted. After sincere discussions between Mr. Liang and representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and the exchanges, most of the issues were resolved, and it was agreed that the payments would be fully reported and submitted between the 10th and 15th of this month. During the tea party, Wang, Mu, Gu, Xu, and others spoke successively. The event lasted two hours and ended on a joyful note.

### Brief Shipping Report

New Rules for Cargo Handling

Since the reorganization and reform of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghai (Yangtze River and coastal) lines, the comprador system has been abolished and replaced with a purser system. The original cargo handling personnel, who were previously employed by the compradors, are now directly employed by the company. (The company has specially formulated new rules to ensure the safety of cargo transportation and to ensure that cargo handlers are responsible. All Jianghai vessels are divided into two grades, A and B. Grade A cargo handlers must pay a credit guarantee of 10,000 yuan and a cash deposit of 5,000 yuan. Grade B cargo handlers must pay a credit guarantee of 6,000 yuan and a cash deposit of 3,000 yuan. The company has ordered all cargo handlers to pay these amounts as soon as possible, but the cargo handlers on each ship do not have the financial means to do so and have not yet paid.)

Baofeng Runs Aground

The Baofeng, a ship belonging to the Nanshi Julun Company, which operates on the Shanghai-Chongming-Qidong route, ran aground on the 3rd of this month. At 9:00 AM, while sailing opposite Baoshan, fog rolled in, obscuring the waterway. The ship mistakenly sailed into shallow water and ran aground. At that time, the ship was heavily laden with cargo and passengers, causing the hull to sink further into the sand and preventing it from being freed. After a day and a night, at 4:00 AM on the 4th, during the high tide, the ship took the opportunity to reverse at high speed and was able to escape danger. After leaving the shallows, it was discovered that the grounding had damaged the ship below the waterline, making immediate inspection impossible. Yesterday, the ship returned to Shanghai. The company immediately reported the incident to the Maritime Administration and the United Ship Insurance Association, who dispatched surveyors to inspect the ship.

Zhenyuan Collides with a Ship

A telegram arrived in Shanghai yesterday from the Yongyuan Shipping Company's Zhenyuan ship, stating that it had departed from Tianjin on the 5th, bound for Yingkou. While exiting near the Dagu estuary, it encountered a sailboat entering the port. At the time, the tide was receding, and the current was strong, causing the Zhenyuan to collide with the sailboat. The sailboat was damaged. Due to the receding tide, the Zhenyuan was unable to stop and proceeded out to sea. However, the Tianjin company was instructed to inspect the damaged sailboat first and then negotiate.

### Request to Change the Zhujia Gou Dredging Plan

Request Submitted Through the Municipal Party Headquarters

Tao Qinwen, a standing committee member of the 12th branch of the 5th district of the Lixing area of Pudong, submitted a request to higher authorities through the Municipal Party Headquarters, asking the Municipal Government to change the dredging plan for the Zhujia Gou canal and Zhen River because it affects residential houses. The request was submitted to the 5th district party headquarters the other day, stating: Dredging the Zhujia Gou canal will affect residential houses. Please submit this request to the Municipal Party Headquarters, which will then request the Municipal Government to change the course of the river to facilitate water transport and avoid demolishing houses. Investigations reveal that dredging the Zhujia Gou canal and Zhen River will indeed have a significant impact on residential houses. Previously, comrades from our branch and local residents jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Government, asking it to send personnel to conduct an on-site survey to avoid dredging the Zhen River. Subsequently, the Municipal Government sent personnel to conduct a survey and issued instructions stating that "Since the East and West Zhujia Gou canals will be dredged, the Zhen River must also be dredged simultaneously to be effective. The residents should build the retaining walls on both sides, but since the residents are unable to bear the cost, the government will find another way to fund it to show its compassion. If the canal is dredged to the Xiaoluo on the south bank, the Bureau of Public Works should build a new road to avoid disrupting traffic!" After receiving the order, comrades, for the sake of their family and property, continued to ask the Municipal Government to consider the plight of the people and exempt the Zhen River section from further construction, and requested a change of plan to bypass the Zhenbei Yaogou Yangshu Gou areas and proceed with the plan. Subsequently, the Municipal Government issued Decree No. 33 rejecting the request. We are extremely dismayed. Our comrades' request to the Municipal Government to bypass and dredge the river is the consensus of the local people. Therefore, the funds required to purchase six mu of farmland for the bypass, the people are willing to raise, and build another retaining wall, the Municipal Government will spend a great deal. If this amount is used for bypassing and dredging the river, it will avoid demolition of houses, and water transportation will also be facilitated. The people are optimistic about its success. Therefore, we dare to submit this request, asking you to forward it to the Municipal Party Headquarters, which will then request the Municipal Government to understand public opinion and approve our request. It is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the 5th District Party Headquarters. Subsequently, the Party Headquarters issued an order stating that the petition has been forwarded to the Municipal Executive Committee for review. Please be informed of this order.

### Japanese Residents in the Extra-Settlement Road Area Refuse to Pay Rent, Reaching 3 Million Yuan

Translated from the English Da Mei Evening News by a Foreign News Agency: The economic struggle between Chinese and Japanese residents in Hongkou is quite serious. Since the Shanghai Incident of 1932, Japanese residents and merchants have refused to pay rent and property taxes, and they deny that they are in arrears. Since Chinese people know that there is no legal recourse, they no longer pursue such matters. However, foreign landlords, because they employ Japanese legal experts and have the assistance of the consular and party authorities, do not suffer such losses. Might makes right. This is not only seen in the Hongkou housing issue, but such situations are too numerous to count. For example, there is a famous landlord who owned a large amount of property before the Shanghai Incident. After the war, due to the impact of this rent refusal, he gradually sold off his properties and now only has twenty or so left. However, even collecting rent for these twenty or so buildings is very difficult. A few weeks ago, a certain Japanese man owed rent for a total of twenty-four months. The lawsuit filed with the Japanese Public Hall resulted in a judgment that he had to pay one-fourth of the full amount first, but in the end, he was allowed to move out without paying a penny. In the past two years, the landlord had even paid for his water and other expenses. There are also unscrupulous Chinese people who act as accomplices to the Japanese, so there is suspicion about renting to Chinese people who come to rent. The Continental Bank has about 200 houses in Hongkou. Half of the tenants are Japanese, and more than one-third owe rent for February to June. For example, the bank has a total of 165 houses on Scott Road and 61 houses in Continental New Village, of which 15 are rented to Japanese tenants, owing a total of 3,200 yuan in rent. There are 43 houses in Liuqing Xiaozhu, of which 14 are rented to Japanese tenants, each owing an average of 300 yuan. There are 57 houses in Songwei Fang, most of which are rented to Japanese tenants, owing a total of 1,500 yuan for 30 months. From these examples, one can imagine the general situation. Shanghai Yeguang Real Estate Company is run by the British and has a total of 500 houses in Hongkou. Except for a small number of tenants who are in arrears due to financial difficulties, there are no other losses. Furthermore, sub-landlords also suffer significant losses. They are unable to seek legal recourse and cannot afford to pay the rent, so their plight is imaginable. Our reporter immediately went to North Sichuan Road to investigate the situation. According to a Cantonese sub-landlord, he had leased a room for 8 yuan per month to a Japanese person, but after three months, he only received 8 yuan. After repeated arguments, the tenant finally moved out. In addition to generating resentment, the sub-landlord also had to pay for the moving expenses. What is even more difficult is that after subletting, some Japanese and Korean thugs use the premises to traffic drugs, so some would rather leave the premises vacant than take such a great risk. This situation only occurs in the Hongkou area. According to a real estate merchant, Japanese residents in other areas pay rent and abide by the law, just like other foreigners.

### Japanese Female Reporter Ms. Ishiwara Kiyoko Invited Women's Circles to a Forum Yesterday

Over Sixty People Attended, Including Lu Lihua. A Joint Farewell Banquet Will be Held for the Women's Circles Tonight

Ms. Ishiwara Kiyoko, a reporter for the Japanese Toyo Keizai Shinpo and a commentator for the women's column of the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun, came to China this time to observe and investigate the national conditions and the trends of the women's movement in our country. After arriving in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday, she believed that Shanghai was the economic, political, and cultural center of our country. In order to gain a deeper understanding, she specially invited leaders of women's circles in this city to hold a forum at the 9th floor of the YMCA on Baixianqiao at 4:00 PM yesterday. Over sixty people attended, including Lu Lihua, the principal of Liangjiang School, Lin Kecong of the Women's Association, Jin Guangmei of the Women's Progressive Association, and Yan Zhenwang, Shen Ziji, Wang Ruqi, Jiang Huiruo, Wu Deyi, Ling Jixi, Jiang Ping, Huang Biyao, Jin Bingying, Jiang Yixiao, Liang Guang, and female reporter Tani Yoko of the Mainichi Shimbun, and Ms. Mishima, a reporter for the Shanghai Daily. During the meeting, they reported, instructed, and elaborated in detail on the past history and future trends of the women's movement in the two countries. Cui Wanqiu and Lai Guifu served as translators. The details are recorded as follows:

Ishiwara's Speech

After the seating, Lai Guifu introduced Ms. Ishiwara Kiyoko's resume. Ms. Ishiwara stood up and gave a speech, saying that she invited leaders of women's circles to hold a forum in Shanghai today to strengthen ties. She was very happy and honored that everyone had come. She regretted that she did not know Chinese and could not fully chat with everyone. However, the connection between people's feelings lies in mutual understanding, so the lack of language should not hinder our friendship. She had been in China since the beginning of last month, traveling to Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and other places. What she had seen and heard made her feel that the rapid progress of various undertakings in your country and the true face of your country were very different from what she had read in newspapers at home. What was especially enviable was that women in your country had already occupied a considerable position in politics, and the women's movement was booming and had a bright future. However, thinking of the women in her country who are still under the oppression of male power and have no equality or freedom, she felt ashamed. In the future, she hoped that we could eliminate boundaries, join hands to fight for equal rights for men and women, and exert our remaining strength to assist in promoting national political and educational construction to fulfill our national duties and not fail this life. Today, she had prepared a simple banquet and hoped that the sisters would not abandon it and give her advice. She was endlessly grateful.

Lu Lihua's Speech

Lu Lihua then stood up and said that she was deeply sorry that Ms. Ishiwara had come to our country, and we were not involved in the matter, so we did not have enough time to prepare for the reception. Now, we are even more grateful and ashamed to have been invited by Ms. Ishiwara to a grand meeting. Ms. Ishiwara is a leading expert in the study of politics and economics in the Japanese women's circle. From the experience of this women's circle, she will be able to use her extraordinary insights to promote the harmony of national conditions between the two countries. I have two major hopes for Ms. Ishiwara. As Ms. Ishiwara said, she has a deep understanding of our country in this month of on-site observation, and she feels that the reports and rumors in Japan are not entirely accurate. In fact, we also know that the misrepresentation of our neighboring country's newspapers has caused various adverse international impressions. We hope that Ms. Ishiwara will introduce what she actually observed to the people of your country to verify the truth after returning home. She recalled that in the 20th year of the Republic of China, she once traveled to Japan to participate in the Tokyo Women's Association. The chairman and others talked about the close geographical proximity between our country and your country, which is no different from brothers and sisters, lips and teeth are interdependent, and we are concerned about each other. In the past, due to the many interferences in the political situation between the two countries, we have not been able to achieve coordination, and the losses are self-evident. Therefore, she tried her best to advocate that women in the two countries should rise up to assist the government, connect with each other, coexist and prosper. She hoped that Ms. Ishiwara would awaken the national female compatriots after returning home and shoulder this arduous task together. Finally, Ms. Huang Biyao, Ms. Wang Ruqi, Ms. Kōno Eiko, and Ms. Mishima successively expressed their opinions on the trends of the women's movement in the two countries, and they elaborated on many points. The atmosphere in the whole hall was extremely harmonious, and the meeting did not end until about 7:00 PM.

Tonight's Banquet

It is learned that Ms. Ishiwara will leave Shanghai for her home country on the 13th. The women's circles in this city are scheduled to hold a joint banquet at the Dadong Restaurant at 6:00 PM tonight to show their gratitude and do their best as hosts.

### Zhu Xuefan Broadcasts in Washington

The Textile Conference Achieved Significant Results. I Hope That China and the United States Can Know and Understand Each Other

Mr. Zhu Xuefan, the Chinese labor representative attending the 23rd International Labor Conference and the World Textile Conference, broadcasted a speech at the National Broadcasting Company in Washington after the World Textile Conference. The text of his speech is recorded below: Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I am honored to have the opportunity to represent Chinese workers at the World Textile Conference, and therefore I am able to visit your country and admire your magnificent capital. I would like to extend the warm greetings of Chinese workers to you. I have only been here for a few days, but I already feel very comfortable. I am very grateful for the courteous reception of the people and government of your country. I attended this conference in the hope that the conference would have an effective measure to establish the foundation of international cooperation, social justice, and world peace. Millions of my fellow workers are looking forward to me bringing back some good results from this conference. Judging from the results of our conference, I will not be going back empty-handed. At present, Chinese workers may not have the same good living conditions as American workers, but we have our inherent characteristics. For example, Chinese workers are poor, but they are hardworking, honest, and reliable. People outside of China will not understand their true situation, but they will soon be understood in the United States. Since I arrived in your country, I am very happy to note that the American people have a deep concern for our country and our people. As your able President said to the conference delegates at the White House last Thursday, we should all study each other more so that we can understand each other more deeply. The Chinese people have always admired your country and your people. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, we have always maintained a cooperative and harmonious relationship. This is a sentence that I am very pleased to say. I would like to take this opportunity to hope that the people of the two countries will study each other more so that they can understand each other more deeply and be more friendly. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to you.

### Mayor Yu Also Serves Concurrently as the Director of the Municipal Martial Arts Hall

Since the former Mayor Wu Tiecheng was transferred to Guangdong, the position of Director of the Municipal Martial Arts Hall, which is held concurrently by the Mayor, cannot be vacant. It is because promoting martial arts and managing the affairs of the hall depend on the leadership and guidance of the Director. It is learned that the hall, following the precedent of previous Mayors serving concurrently as Director, has submitted a request to Mayor Yu for approval to serve concurrently as Director. The future of martial arts in this city will definitely have new facilities.

### The Public Works Department Postpones Discussion on the Extra-Settlement Road Issue

The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department originally planned to continue discussing the extra-settlement road issue at the meeting on the 6th of this month. However, the memorandum submitted by the Japanese Consul General to the Director of the Public Works Department has just been received by Mayor Yu. Mayor Yu has not yet expressed his opinion on the memorandum, so it has been decided to postpone the discussion on the extra-settlement road issue.

### Lawyer Bao Gang Will Go Abroad

### Xi Lanqing's Concubine is Accused of Fraud and Turns Herself in to the Police

Denies Occupation of Shanghai Gas Stock

Xi Lanqing of Pudong has a considerable fortune and owns property in Hangzhou and Shanghai. He died of old age and illness in January of this year. His concubine, Zhou Huilin, recently instructed Fu Jiafu (also known as Minzhai), Hu Shulin, Peng Ren, and others to transfer 770 shares of Xi's Shanghai Gas Company stock to her name. Xi's children believed that this was embezzlement, so they reported it to the Zhabei Police Station, ordering the detectives to arrest Hu Shulin and Peng Ren first. They were transferred to the First Special Court, which approved bail and adjourned the hearing. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. At 6:00 AM yesterday, Zhou Huilin and Fu Minzhai suddenly turned themselves in to the Zhabei Police Station, accompanied by lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yu Xiangqin. After a brief interrogation by detectives Pang Ruiqing and Wang Shusen, they were detained. At 9:00 AM, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing. First, police lawyer Wang Yaotang presented the case, prosecuting Zhou Huilin on charges of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law and requesting that the case be heard together with Hu Shulin and others. Zhou Huilin testified that she and Xi Lanqing were formally married and had held a wedding ceremony, not a concubine. Lanqing was old and sick, so he often lived with me and I took care of him. I could not leave him. The shares of the Gas Company were given to me by Xi, so the transfer application was also signed by him in person. I did not know English, so I entrusted Fu Minzhai and Hu Shulin to contact the Gas Company. Peng Ren is a friend of Hu. The woman's lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Yu Xiangqin, immediately said that the defendant, Zhou Huilin, had just arrived in Shanghai today and turned herself in to the police station. She intended to write a detailed plea, detailing the process for the court's reference, but she suffered from severe stomach problems. Fu Jiafu went to Shaoxing to collect accounts and rushed to report the case with Zhou when he heard the news, so she requested permission to post bail. Judge Feng approved the application after verification and ordered that the case be heard with Hu Shulin and others at a later date. Zhou and Fu were allowed to post bail of 8,000 yuan each. Before finding bail, their defense lawyers were temporarily responsible for their release.

### National Coal Production and Sales Association Asks National Goods Association to Jointly Promote National Coal

Heartbroken by the Concession of the Liujiang Coal Mine

Xin Xin She reported: The China National Coal Production and Sales Joint Association sent a letter to the Shanghai China National Goods Maintenance Association, stating: Recently, we read in the newspaper that the Manufacturers Association sent a letter to the Coal Industry Joint Association regarding the Liujiang Coal Mine Company transferring all property rights to the Thai Kee Company.

### Private Power Industry Association Continues to Hold Diesel User Meeting

Name Changed and Articles of Association Adopted

The National Private Power Industry Federation, because of the continued increase in the price of diesel and because the local managers of the Mobil and Asiatic oil companies often fail to supply the contracted amount, the technical committee of the association, Shen Sifang, etc., in accordance with the resolutions of the annual meeting, initiated and convened various colleagues who use diesel as fuel to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures, and at the same time prepare to organize consumer cooperation organizations to seek relief. All the attending members unanimously decided to first establish a preparatory committee, publicly electing Shen Sifang and Tang Chengxin as the chief and deputy directors of the preparatory committee, and also appointing representatives Shen Sifang, Yu Qihan, Wu Shuying, Han Yimin, and Tang Chengxin to immediately negotiate with Mobil. It has been heard that Mobil and other companies have indeed expressed substantial concessions, but the association is not satisfied with the various preferential measures it has won, so yesterday (6th) at 2:00 PM, it continued to hold a general meeting at Yijia Chun to determine the final policy. Over sixty people attended, including various initiators and members such as Shen Sifang. First, Chairman Shen Sifang reported on the significance of the establishment of the association and the progress of the preparations, and said that since diesel is a necessary fuel for each power plant, the diesel problem should be given extreme importance. It is of great significance to jointly initiate and organize this association today. Since all parties have already established close ties, they can cooperate fully in the future and will not be afraid of any difficulties. Next, Yu Qihan and Huang Youlan expressed their opinions successively, and Yu Qihan proposed that the preparatory committee be canceled and renamed the Fuel Committee of the National Private Power Industry Federation. The resolution was passed, and the draft articles of association were formulated as follows: Article 1: This association is named the Fuel Committee of the National Private Power Industry Federation, and the association is located in Shanghai. Article 2: The purpose of this association is to protect the interests of diesel users. Article 3: All colleagues who join the Private Power Industry Federation can be members of this association. Article 4: The affairs of this association are governed by a committee system. Article 5: This association holds a general meeting once a year to elect nine committee members (three alternate committee members) to form a committee, and their term of office is one year. The committee implements the tasks stipulated in Article 2 of these Articles of Association and is responsible for the safekeeping and allocation of the association's funds. Article 6: This association has one chairman and one secretary-general, who are elected and appointed by the committee at the annual meeting, and their term of office is one year, and they can be re-elected. Their powers are stipulated in the outline of business. Article 7: The expenses of this association are borne by the members. Article 8: This association has investigation, research, consultation, and negotiation departments. After the discussion was completed, it was decided to send Tang Chengxin to Mobil to express oral gratitude. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.

### Unsuccessful Kidnapping of Cao Qiming by Bandits, Chinese Constable Han Juncai Dies in the Line of Duty

Traffic Disrupted in Tangjiawan to Search for Bandits, but No Trace Found; Four People Wounded by Stray Bullets as Bandits Open Fire Along the Way

Yesterday morning at approximately 9:00 AM, a major incident of attempted kidnapping and resistance to arrest occurred at the Tangjiawan entrance on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. A Chinese constable died in the line of duty, killed instantly, and three men and women were wounded by stray bullets. The four bandits escaped without a trace amidst the chaos. Details are as follows:

Background of the Victim

Cao Qiming, a local businessman, is currently 58 years old. He initially made his fortune in the shipping industry and later established the Baofeng Cotton Yarn Company at No. 51, Lane 2, Jiangxi Road, serving as its general manager. He resides in a self-built mansion, Song Lu, at No. 58, Lane 16 (Xianchengfang), Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. The magnificent structure on Caohijing Road in western Shanghai is also Cao's self-built Cao Clan Ancestral Hall.

The Four Bandits

Although Cao is nearing sixty, he is quite frugal, disciplined, and diligent in his duties. Every morning, he arrives at his office no later than 9:30 AM. Yesterday morning, after the bell had rung nine times, he had a light breakfast and walked out of the lane with a friend, intending to board his private car (Concession No. 591). The driver, Cao Renfu (21 years old, local), was reaching out to open the car door when four bandits, two in long gowns and two in short attire, suddenly leaped out from the roadside, each with a pistol, and surrounded the car.

Chinese Constable Rushes to the Rescue

The driver, upon seeing this, was stunned. Cao turned ashen. At this critical moment, a passerby behind them saw what was happening and shouted, "Robbers!" At that moment, Chinese Constable Han Juncai, Badge No. 611, who was on duty in that section, heard the alarm and rushed from the west. He caught sight of Cao being besieged by the bandits and was about to bravely step forward to rescue him when the four bandits, aiming to preempt any action, swiftly dodged to the side of the car and opened fire at the constable. The constable quickly fired eight shots in return, but none hit their mark.

Death in the Line of Duty

The constable, with no cover, was struck by three bullets, one of which hit his chest, causing him to collapse and fall in front of the Shuifeng Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 14, Lane Entrance. According to eyewitnesses, after falling to the ground, the constable struggled to pursue the bandits, but because the bullet had hit a vital spot, he died instantly. He was indeed courageous. In that instant, Cao managed to turn around and flee back into the lane, thus avoiding the fate of becoming a hostage. Compared to the constable, he was fortunate and unfortunate.

Search Yields Nothing

The bandits fired wildly, and pedestrians fled in all directions. The four bandits took advantage of the chaos and disappeared into the crowd. When the French police arrived, they immediately dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives. However, the bandits were gone. The police chief ordered the temporary closure of traffic from the iron gate of the Tangjiawan small vegetable market in the west to Caishi Road in the east for a thorough search, but to no avail. At the same time, the Western Branch of the Chinese-administered area also dispatched a large number of patrolmen to assist in checking pedestrians, but no one was found.

The Deceased's Loyalty and Bravery

The police chief first had the body of the deceased Chinese Constable Han Juncai taken to the autopsy room attached to the Public Works Department Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour for a coroner's examination. Constable Han was from Hebei and was only 29 years old. He had been working since January of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], completing six years of service. He had a wife, Zhang, who was 22 years old, and a two-year-old son. Constable Han was loyal to his duties and was praised by the authorities. His funeral was exceptionally somber. The police department has decided to provide generous compensation, and it is reported that Cao Qiming, deeply moved by the constable's spirit of sacrificing himself to save him, has also decided to provide generous compensation to comfort the loyal spirit.

Stray Bullets Injure People

As the bandits opened fire and fled, several people were injured by stray bullets near the Tangjiawan small vegetable market, which was bustling with activity. The injured included Li Qizi (16 years old, from Jiangbei), who was wounded in the thigh; Wang Xilin (25 years old, local hairdresser working at Youfang Hair Salon on Songjiang Road), who was wounded in the calf; Wang Jinlin, a worker at Shouji Hair Salon on Rue du Père Robert, was also injured; and Zhou Chengshi, the wife of French police detective Zhou Bingcheng, who was wounded in the thigh while returning home from buying vegetables near the Renshouli entrance. The police department sent her to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

Prior Extortion

According to the victim's family, they had received two threatening letters from bandits a month ago. The first letter demanded $50,000, and the second increased the amount to $70,000, asking them to meet on Zhongshan Road. The Cao family sent someone to Zhongshan Road, but the bandits did not send anyone to negotiate. Subsequently, in order to prevent any unforeseen circumstances, the Cao family reported the matter to the French police, asking them to pay attention. Unexpectedly, this unfortunate incident occurred. It remains doubtful whether the letters were related to the bandits today.

### Two Bandits Sentenced in Extortion Case

Yu Lianwen Sentenced to Two and a Half Years; Wang Huairong Sentenced to One Year

Yu Lianwen from Nanjing and Wang Huairong from Tongzhou, between January 26 and April 7 of this year, wrote a total of three threatening letters and delivered them to Tang Guonian, an employee of Ruichang Hardware Store at No. 41, Route Tenant de la Tour. They claimed to be subordinates of Zhang Kun, the deputy battalion commander of the Central Soviet Red Army, planning to establish an army school and raise $50,000. They enclosed two blank sheets of paper, instructing him to write "agree" or "disagree" and post them at the lane entrance. Initially, he ignored them, but then he received another letter, inquiring and requesting him to send a representative with a roll of plum-colored paper as a sign to meet at the corner of Qimei Road and Huangxing Road in Zhabei. When he went to observe the situation, no one came to negotiate. Subsequently, Huide Detective Liu Decheng, Detectives Qiu Zhenting, Xu Shutian, and Li Zhaokang from the Huishan Police Station saw Yu and Wang at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant at No. 405, Pingliang Road, making a phone call to Tang Guonian to urge payment. They were arrested together and taken to the First Special District Court for interrogation, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that during the adjournment, it was discovered that the two defendants, along with Zhang Asi and Cai Wenhui, who had fled, had sent three threatening letters to Zhang Kaiyuan (an employee of Shunjinlong Foreign Firm at No. 150, Jiujiang Road), a Ningbo native at No. 8, Lane 159, Pingliang Road, between March 25 and April 1. The letters, written on behalf of the Youth League in an excited tone, stated, "If you don't give us this $5,000, you will lose both your money and your life, and you will regret it." They requested him to send a representative to negotiate near Qimei Road and Huangxing Road in Zhabei. At the appointed time, Zhang sent his friend Liu Jinfu to meet, but no one came. Fearing arrest, he presented the letters for investigation. Liu Jinfu testified that he had gone to observe, but they dared not meet him. Today, Zhang Kaiyuan is unwell and cannot come to court to testify. When questioned, Yu Lianwen confessed that Zhang Asi and Cai Wenhui had instigated the matter and admitted to only writing one letter. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Wang Huairong confessed that his statement at the police station about dividing the $5,000 among the four was false. He said that he was ultimately deceived in this matter and asked for leniency. Judge Xiao sentenced Yu Lianwen to two and a half years of imprisonment and Wang Huairong to one year. The threatening letters were confiscated.

### Trafficker Chen Yusheng and Wife Deceive Seventeen Young Girls

Using the Guise of Recruiting Female Workers for Cotton Mills, Planning to Take Them to Other Ports on Japanese Ships

The Fourth Detective Squad of the Municipal Police Bureau recently received a report from Yin Lianchun (53 years old) from Taixing, stating that his fellow villager, Chen Yusheng (37 years old), had sent his wife, Yang (23 years old), back to their village at the beginning of last month, claiming to recruit female workers for a cotton mill in Shanghai. Seventeen young girls, including Wu Xiaomei (17 years old), Bu Xiaonv (17), Chen Xier (16), Tang Linshi (19), Luo Xiaomei (21), Yang Xiaomei (19), Chen Fengying (24), Zhang Fengzhen (18), Wang Xiaomei (17), Wu Zhuwu (16), Qian Yumei (16), and Chen Xiaomei (17), Yin Shouzhen (15), Zhang Laoer (18), Zhang Aer (18), Chen Tongnu (17), Chen Houying (17) introduced by Yin, followed Yang to Shanghai and stayed at No. 55, Toyota Cotton Mill Dormitory in western Shanghai. On the 2nd of this month, Chen Yusheng, along with Wang Qingpei (24 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 928, Puyili, Tokyo Road), his wife Yang, their children, and the seventeen young girls from Taixing, went to the Gongping Hostel on Gongping Road in Hongkou, where they rented rooms No. 123. They planned to take them on a Japanese ship to other ports to sell them. On the evening of the 3rd, Yin received a telegram from his daughter, Yin Jianmao (17 years old, currently a worker at the Japanese-owned Toyota Cotton Mill), reporting the details. He came to Shanghai to investigate. Upon receiving the report, the squad leader, Zhang Zhongde, immediately dispatched team leader Tang Bingxiang, detectives Han Yushan, Zhao Renxin, Liang Jianwu, Zhao Jinhui, Li Xinheng, and others, along with the Tilanqiao Police Station, to the Gongping Hostel. They arrested Chen Yusheng and his wife, Wang Qingpei, Chen's two sons and two daughters, and the seventeen young girls. They were all taken to the headquarters for interrogation. It is also reported that Chen Yusheng had committed several robbery cases in his hometown.

### High Price of Foreign Wheat Raises Costs, Many Flour Mills Suspend Operations or Reduce Working Hours

According to Dagong News Agency, flour mills in various regions are ordering foreign wheat to make up for the shortage of domestic wheat production. Currently, foreign wheat is also in short supply in overseas markets due to scarcity, leading to price increases and increased costs. They have stopped ordering. The various factories face raw material difficulties and are successively suspending operations or reducing working hours. Dagong News Agency reporters investigated the situation as follows:

High Cost of Foreign Wheat

Countries such as Canada, Chicago, and Australia are well-known wheat-producing areas in the world. Their annual production accounts for more than 90% of the world's total. However, last year, due to weather conditions, wheat production was scarce and the harvest was drastically reduced. Demand exceeded supply, and the market lacked raw materials. As a result, market prices increased, with a difference of 20-30% compared to Chinese wheat. There are very few spot goods traded in the market. If foreign wheat is ordered, the delivery date is also not fixed. This also shows a glimpse of the supply of foreign wheat.

Suspension of Operations and Reduction of Working Hours

Flour mills in Shanghai, such as Fuxin, Fufeng, and Zhongda, as well as factories in Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, Luonan, and other inland areas, collected funds to order more than 60,000 bags of foreign wheat from foreign firms, as they felt that the stocks were empty after Japanese merchants purchased domestic wheat. Since January of this year, they have been applying to the producing areas to load and ship in batches to Shanghai to supply the various factories in Shanghai and other ports. However, as a result, the amount of foreign wheat purchased was limited, like a drop in the bucket, and it did not help. In order to maintain operations until the new domestic wheat is produced, the factories have successively suspended operations or reduced working hours. Currently, it is estimated that the factories that are operating are only operating at an average of 30%. All workers, except for a small number who are retained for work, have been temporarily dismissed and will be rehired after the new wheat comes on the market.

Current State of Wheat Production

Since the beginning of this year, the weather has been abnormal, with continuous rain. The season has been suddenly cold and warm, so the wheat sown by farmers has been affected by the accumulation of water in the wheat fields. Although the weather has recently warmed up, the spring crops have been affected by this injury and have entered a state of illness. The future production volume will inevitably be reduced. The situation in the provinces south of the Yangtze River is similar, but according to the reporter's investigation, the wheat in provinces in North China, such as Shandong and Shanxi, is growing well due to the balanced climate and moderate rainfall. Its production can be predicted to be abundant.

### Gambling Den Cracked Down on at Target Road

All Foreign Residents from the Philippines and Japan; a Total of Fifty-Six People

Yesterday afternoon, the Hongkou Police Department received a tip that there was a secret gambling den in a house at No. 289, Target Road, set up by Japanese and Filipino residents, attracting people to join the game, determining the outcome by rolling two dice, with large wins and losses. After receiving the report, the police immediately notified the police chiefs of the American and Japanese consulates, who jointly assigned personnel to arrest them. They found people shouting and betting in the house, so they arrested 56 gamblers and confiscated two dice. After a brief interrogation at the police station, personnel from the American and Japanese consulates took the Japanese and Filipino gamblers to the American and Japanese consulates for interrogation.

### Anti-Smuggling Movement

— Why Bother

Our country's three major products, rice, tea, and silk, all have a "nightmarish" aspect now. For example, in Guangdong Province, foreign rice is imported duty-free, while in the interior, rice prices have plummeted due to an oversupply of grain. Furthermore, due to floods, droughts, war, and rural bankruptcy, farmers who regard land as a treasure are unable to support themselves. The tea market is not very clear, but with the promotion of Ceylon tea, the domestic tea market may also be very narrow. As for the silk industry, due to the rise of artificial silk, it has naturally "plummeted," "silk mills have stopped weighing," and "silkworm farmers regard raising silkworms as a dreaded task." These unfortunate news stories have become so commonplace that they no longer arouse people's concern. Since smuggling has become rampant, domestic silk has become even more miserable. In this precarious situation, we have seen the joint declaration of the Fuzhou silk industry, "declaring the implementation of refusing to sell smuggled goods in order to fulfill the patriotic duty of merchants."

The smuggling has affected more than just the silk industry. The call to "refuse to sell smuggled goods" seems to have been loudly proclaimed by all industries, but without the formal declaration of the Fuzhou silk industry. This method seems correct at first glance. If all industries unite to refuse to sell smuggled goods, and smuggled goods have no sales channels, smuggling will naturally disappear. However, this passive method is at least not feasible now. As the communication from the "Fujian Merchants' Anti-Smuggling Movement" said, "The famous silk shops that joined the trade association, also 'blinded by profit,' blatantly disregarded the association's sanctions and sold artificial silk products in large quantities, and not only sold them in this city, but also shipped them to various counties in eastern and northern Fujian for dumping. The reason is that the artificial silk and satin produced by a certain country have lower tariffs and lighter costs." Therefore, "last year, the total turnover of silk in the city was six million yuan. In addition to the 2.7 million yuan accounted for by the members of the silk industry association, smuggled goods, wholesale sales by foreign merchants, and stores and hawkers who did not join the association accounted for as much as 3.3 million yuan." It can be seen from this that even if the joint declaration takes effect, the "artificial silk and satin produced by a certain country" still has the advantage of "lower tariffs and lighter costs." Regarding the latter, since various countries are replacing labor with machines, all kinds of goods are now produced quickly and at low cost. For example, newspapers, which are closely related to our newspaper industry, when paper prices soared, we still had to wait until they rose to five yuan before customs (this was in January of this year, and it has already reached this number) before we could compete with foreign goods. Then, when they slightly lower the price, will we still have a "way out"? As for the former, we naturally don't need to say more.

However, when "armed anti-smuggling cannot be done in reality," "refusing to sell smuggled goods" is naturally a second-best option, because "if it is smuggled, the cost is light and light," and it is easy to take away the entire turnover of six million yuan in the city. On the other hand, how to improve the silk industry is also an urgent task for experts. Not only that, other national industries are no exception. Otherwise, they can still dump goods on the Chinese market due to the convenience of "lower tariffs and lighter costs."

"To fulfill the patriotic duty of merchants" cannot be seen to be effective by "being blinded by profit and being subject to association sanctions."

### Where are the Slum Dwellers Going?

— Jianping

At the end of last month, we were still worried about the forced demolition of straw sheds on the 3rd of this month, which would cause "unpredictable dangers." However, now we are glad to see a "peaceful resolution." Of course, this so-called "peaceful resolution" is not as perfect as hoped. However, the slight easing of the tough attitude is the result of unanimous public opposition. But, after the "peaceful resolution," where will the slum dwellers go?

According to reports, the "peaceful resolution" is as follows: "The Public Works Department allows the slum dwellers to dismantle their own straw sheds, with a subsidy of fourteen yuan per household. The more than four hundred slum dwellers west of Lan Road are required to completely dismantle their sheds themselves before the 6th of this month." And the fourteen yuan subsidy has the following restrictions: "Slum dwellers who voluntarily dismantle their straw sheds must completely clear them before the 6th, and only then can they receive the fourteen yuan subsidy on the 10th. Those who do not dismantle by the 8th will still be forcibly demolished by the Public Works Department, and the subsidy will be cancelled." The signatory on behalf of the slum dwellers is Yin Yifu, and he "signed with the Public Works Department first and then notified the slum dwellers." There are quite a few questions here, but the weakness ultimately lies with the slum dwellers' representative, so we will leave him aside for now. But is this "peaceful resolution" a good solution? Let us now calculate this account. The Public Works Department's reason for not accepting the slum dwellers' suggestion is of course the issue of demolition time; and the reason for rejecting the Chinese directors' suggestion to "donate 100,000 yuan to build civilian villages for the slum dwellers" is probably not only the time issue, but also the cost issue. However, if we calculate the cost of subsidizing the slum dwellers, it doesn't seem to be the case. There are more than four hundred, almost five hundred slum households. At fourteen yuan per household, if we calculate based on four hundred and fifty households, it amounts to six thousand yuan. And this is only the first batch, there are other slum dwellers later. This subsidy alone, plus the "donation" (not including the slum dwellers' own savings), seems to be enough to build civilian villages, as long as the Public Works Department can understand the difficulties of the slum dwellers and postpone the demolition date to two or three months later.

Now, let us look at the miserable situation of the slum dwellers who painfully accept the "representative's" favor after being forced to relocate. The following situation was reported on the 5th: "Where do the demolished slum dwellers go? Most are wandering and sleeping on the streets, and a small number have moved to the slum areas east of Lan Road and started building new straw sheds." Even if we set aside the "miserable situation," the method itself does not seem to be entirely satisfactory.

As mentioned above, the subsidy of fourteen yuan per household is an expense for the Public Works Department that could be used to subsidize the construction of villages; but the slum dwellers who receive it still gain nothing. Not to mention the loss of "ten to forty or fifty yuan" in the construction cost of the slum dwellers' straw sheds, the current livelihood of the slum dwellers has already become a problem. They must relocate before the 6th of this month, but they will not receive the fourteen yuan subsidy until four days later, which is not enough to solve the immediate problem. This is the first point. Secondly, in the past, although the straw sheds were simple, the problem of housing was at least solved. After receiving the fourteen yuan, they certainly cannot rely on this subsidy as a building cost, and they will have to bear an additional rent cost every month in the future. For poor slum dwellers, life is already without any guarantee. If they are forced to increase their burden, it is actually impossible.

Therefore, a bad result has already occurred. In the state before the demolition order, they are "building new straw sheds" elsewhere. Isn't this adding trouble to the Public Works Department? As for "sleeping on the streets," this is even more outside the scope of "cleaning up the city" and maintaining cleanliness and hygiene.

According to the news on the 5th, there are still more than two hundred households (half of the total) who have not yet complied with the order to relocate and demolish. Whether "unpredictable dangers" will occur by the deadline of the 8th is still unknown. However, even if all of them comply with the order and peacefully demolish, the slum dwellers still have nowhere to go. Being able to see the future result before the deadline should prompt them to abandon the stubborn approach, the narrow-mindedness of Zhou Zhi, and think of a better solution again, right? At the same time, the Chinese directors' suggestion to "donate 100,000 yuan to build civilian villages" should go beyond suggestion and become a reality. Because even if the Public Works Department does not agree, building houses is legal. Otherwise, where should those slum dwellers who "become exiles for fourteen yuan" go? At the same time, we also feel that after learning this lesson, the slum dwellers themselves should know where to go!

### Miscellaneous Writings from D渡口 (D渡口, Dadu River Ferry)

— Jinling

(Spring is here. The kite binds me with vast homesickness.)

The spring breeze passes over the fields and treetops, melancholically.

Like duckweed emerging from the pond, the greenness of life: this light blue sky reveals scales and claws from the grey clouds.

The rain-soaked countryside, the muddy fields, are the song sung by a voice that has returned to the tide. —The mud on the roads sticks to people's feet like their hearts.

The red buildings of the wounded soldiers' hospital, in this silent and vast sky, display a lonely, melancholic decline.

Along the only stone-paved street, two hundred houses are crowded together. The right side is covered with mud: the stumbling steps of passersby scatter the stains onto the half-yellow lime painted on the grass walls. —A river of sluggishly flowing life! Forever, forever slowly dragging on. Depression, like green mold, clings to the edge of this tranquil dream—when will it flow freely?

The sound of the zheng soars silently into the sky, trembling weakly! No one raises their head to look at it, except for the children who have lived in damp, low houses. The smoke lazily hangs on the chimney: but it only hovers like a whirlwind, swirling left and right, never rising straight up to the light blue sky with its scales and claws. Perhaps it also feels the oppressiveness of depression!

In the fields: like tea leaves dumped in the corner of a wall, moistened by the spring rain into a trace of green wheat sprouts, lying weakly on the pig-colored soil. It is a wrinkle of a smile etched on a bronze-colored face; but after all, the depression in the air is too strong, and the smile cannot bloom into a flower.

In that corner of the field ridge: under a few willow trees that have just turned green, an earthen wall encloses a circle. That is the public cemetery! —Originally a private cemetery, it later became a public cemetery because it was horizontally and vertically filled with buried wounded soldiers, so the owner indignantly gave it up! So it became a public cemetery!

My badger sister is buried here.

Growing up in the city, she was unaccustomed to the gloomy corrosion here, and she withered silently in loneliness. However, I do not feel great sorrow, because my sorrow goes to everything under that entire depression: to this stagnant, turbid river of life.

The embankment along the river: years of labor have planted countless blood and sweat. Yet it still always listens lightly and weakly to the blows of the river water.

Rows of wooden stakes are lined up on the edge of the embankment, intending to reduce the surging of the tide. But the sand and mud that can never be compacted are washed into a sinkhole by a wave.

The wooden stakes are also gradually being swallowed by the water.

The spring tide is rising: the embankment is even more weakly and lightly. It is frantically thinning day by day.

Is it hoping for the arrival of a violent wave?

(It's depressing enough here, wash it away!)

### Jingzi

— Nan

Black coffee has a slightly bitter taste, but Jingzi's gentle heart is even more bitter than coffee.

There are memories, but she can no longer sort out when she was driven from her motherland to this barren island in the south! Jingzi's memories are as tangled as silkworms. People say that Singapore is the "Paris on the Equator," a golden and drunken metropolis, but what does this have to do with Jingzi? She smells the stench of money, tastes the astringent life, and she often cries out in her heart:

"Barren island! A place without laughter!"

Times without laughter are something Jingzi needs to cherish. She has to use laughter to disguise the lack of laughter almost all night. When the hand of night grabs this Paris on the Equator, Victoria Road is bustling with traffic, and the Neon-Light of the Capitol Cinema shines on Garbo and Robert Taylor's embrace, Jingzi applies a light rouge to her haggard cheeks, and smears Tangee on her faded lips; she shrugs her breasts and walks out. This coffee shop has comfortable seats, a velvet carpet, and a Radio that is on all night. Sometimes what is broadcast from the evil Radio is a traveler's longing for the bright sunshine of California, sometimes it is the lilac-like melancholy of a lovelorn person, and sometimes it is the "Blue Paradise" full of the atmosphere of the South Seas... Attracted by these different tunes are American sailors or British sailors with different emotions. They come from the civilized West but do not have the politeness of civilized people. When Jingzi serves them the whiskey or coffee they want, she often cannot avoid being dragged into the arms of a man by a pair of strong hands:

"Hallo Sweetheart"!

Sailors are wanderers of the earth, they change their environment from here to there. Last year in May, they were half-drunk in Honolulu, watching the hula dance with hazy eyes, and in October, when the autumn wind rose, they got lost on the streets of the Philippines, and it took them half a day of wandering to get back to the ship. Now, hugging Jingzi in their arms and teasing her with laughter, who knows where they will be in May next year? Wanderers of the earth can sometimes eat with chopsticks in a Chinese restaurant, and sometimes eat Mrs. Kikuko's handmade tea on the shore of Nagasaki...

Jingzi is their Sweetheart, their angel. But the person who calls her an angel today may never come again from tomorrow onwards. The whereabouts of modern people are so erratic.

And there are times when Jingzi's memories are sorted out. One day, she was slapped in the face for no reason by a drunkard with a medicine beard, and she cried out loudly, but no one sympathized with her. Instead, she heard the drunkard scolding her:

"A slave of a fallen country, humph!"

Korea, Jingzi's motherland is fallen. One day when Jingzi was young, she was taken by her fleeing father onto a boat heading to the southern island. Halfway there, her father was devastated by labor and chronic illness. Three months after arriving, he died. Jingzi grew up under the care of others and was also used by others. She has been pretending to be happy in front of people, but living a bitter life...

"A place without laughter! Barren island!"

Although she cried out like this in her heart, people said that this was the only big metropolis in the Malay Peninsula, the main military port of the Great British Empire, and symbolized it as the "Paris on the Equator." Jingzi withered in the laughter of people.

Jingzi, where are you going?
