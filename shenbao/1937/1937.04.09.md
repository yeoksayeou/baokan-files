### The Extraordinary and the Ordinary

Shao Lizi's Broadcast Speech Last Night: Citizens Should Fulfill Ordinary Responsibilities

[Nanjing] Shao Lizi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, delivered a radio address at the Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 8th, titled "The Extraordinary and the Ordinary." The original text is as follows: The topic I am speaking on today is the extraordinary and the ordinary. I am using this topic for my first broadcast speech since serving in the Central Propaganda Department, hoping that all compatriots across the country will realize that China has indeed reached an extraordinary period. We must be extraordinarily diligent and extraordinarily motivated, ready to establish extraordinary achievements to save the country from this extraordinary national crisis. But at the same time, we must remember what Chairman Chiang Kai-shek often taught soldiers: "Wartime should be like peacetime, and peacetime should be like wartime." We must never forget that we are in an extraordinary period, and we must never forget to fulfill

Ordinary Responsibilities

What I am talking about today are only very ordinary principles, but I believe they can contribute to dealing with the extraordinary situation. China has reached an extremely dangerous period and must be determined to deal with extraordinary events at any time. This is already very clear and does not need further explanation. Even a powerful country like Japan is constantly vigilant with each other in extraordinary times. However, we should not be fearful in this situation, scaring away our courage, nor should we be overly excited, revealing a crazy and jumping state. Although the situation is serious, the way to deal with it is very ordinary. As long as everyone uses common sense to understand the situation and uses conscience to fulfill their responsibilities, we can definitely overcome this extraordinary difficulty, but we must never

Leave Our Posts

Abandon our duties to think of other clever strategies to save the country. From a diplomatic perspective, although the world crisis is very urgent, there are also many ways to eliminate it. As the Third Plenary Session Declaration says, "Following the path of international peace, striving to increase friendship, all political coordination and economic cooperation must be based on the principle of mutual benefit, in order to seek closer mutual relations." This is an extremely ordinary diplomatic principle, but it is the fundamental way to eliminate the world crisis. Our country's foreign policy seeks territorial integrity, sovereign independence, and coexistence and co-prosperity with the world. This is also an extremely ordinary requirement, but if it is achieved, it can stabilize the world. There is nothing incredible here, and we would never want to use special political means or special international manipulations to achieve amazing miracles. Recently, Japanese intellectuals have begun to

Understand Our Country Anew

Of course, we admire the progress of the Japanese, but we do not think this is an extraordinary new understanding, but a very ordinary awakening. If we can treat each other with ordinary minds, we can eliminate all barriers and discrimination, and we can also maintain normal relations in international relations. We must also know that if the maintenance of territorial integrity and sovereign independence reaches a completely hopeless period, we must resolutely sacrifice this. This is also a very ordinary self-defense policy for an independent country. There is nothing strange about it. The Fifth National Congress has made such a decision: "We will never give up peace until peace is completely hopeless. When the country reaches a point where sacrifice is inevitable, we must resolutely sacrifice." Some people doubt how to judge these two moments. What standards should be used? I believe that the most reliable tools for judging these two moments are common sense and conscience. What are the general requirements of modern countries? Our China also certainly

Cannot Be an Exception

This principle is even easier to understand when discussing the issue of international economic cooperation. Exchanging what one has for what one needs is the most primitive commercial behavior. There is no profound philosophy in it. If we adhere to the principles of equality and mutual benefit, we can achieve the goal of co-prosperity. Others do not need to be anxious, and we do not need to be suspicious. Moreover, our country's economic construction is just beginning. According to the teachings of the Premier, as long as it does not hinder sovereignty, we can borrow foreign capital. Therefore, any economic cooperation between two countries, if it can be done, is also a very ordinary thing. But as Foreign Minister Wang said, "Economic cooperation is mutual. Cooperation that binds the hands and feet of others cannot be called cooperation." If

In Politics

There is a form that binds our hands and feet, we must first find a way to remove this form before talking about economic cooperation. This is also a very ordinary principle. As long as everyone understands the related relationship between politics and economics, and the inseparability of the economic behavior of the two countries and the national sentiments of the two countries, and everyone fulfills their ordinary responsibilities, then economic cooperation can be realized. Our government is trying to eliminate the obstacles on the road to economic cooperation and hopes that others will do the same. This work is not difficult to do, as long as it is guided by common sense and solved with conscience, it is enough. Furthermore, from the perspective of internal affairs, the

Peaceful Unification

Of the country is also an extremely ordinary requirement. If the country is not unified, it will never be able to resist foreign aggression, and it will never be able to protect the people internally. This is also an extremely ordinary principle. The way to seek national unification, with peaceful negotiation as the principle and military resolution as the exception, is even more of an extremely ordinary approach. The elimination of the disturbances in Guangdong and Guangxi and the resolution of the Xi'an Incident, the methods used were very peaceful and very ordinary. When we use this method, no matter who it is, as long as they appeal to their conscience and common sense, they will immediately feel that there is nothing strange about it and do not need to speculate with special opinions. Eradicating the Red Scourge has been a task that our country has not given up in recent years, but for those communist elements who repent, all are

Allowed to Reform Themselves

This is also an extremely ordinary act of the state. If the communist elements can truly abolish the Red Army and all forces that undermine the unity of the military system, abolish the Soviets and all organizations that undermine the unity of the political system, stop the red propaganda that endangers the nation, abandon the class struggle that divides national unity, understand the ordinary principles of the Third Plenary Session's resolution on eradicating the Red Scourge, and show it to the people of the country with facts, then we will certainly treat them equally and not hold them accountable for the past. Today's situation is extremely serious. Internal unity is definitely not enough to resist foreign aggression. Unified politics and military affairs are definitely not enough to build a modern country. Eradicating the Red Scourge is a necessary condition for stabilizing the country. Allowing communists to reform themselves is a

Ordinary Work

The government is simply fulfilling its due responsibility. The people can be said to have a common hope. Friendly nations should also see this as a very ordinary thing in China's internal affairs. As for currency reform, financial reorganization, bank control, unification of military orders and military administration, training of the masses, construction of railways and highways, these are all extremely ordinary things in building a modern country. However, in this extraordinary period, we need special efforts to recognize the importance of these things. It is the common sense that the people should have to assist the government in completing these tasks. It is the conscience that the people share. In the end, we want to say a few words to compatriots from all walks of life. Although the national crisis is serious, the opportunity for rejuvenation is already ripe. Although the work of saving the country and preserving its existence in recent years has not shown extraordinary achievements, there will eventually be a satisfactory answer to all compatriots across the country. Moreover, the period of the answer is not very far away. The victory in the Suiyuan resistance, the success of the legal tender policy, and the steady progress of economic construction are the first voices of a satisfactory answer. As long as everyone holds on to this opportunity for rejuvenation, uses conscience to

Help the Government and uses common sense to judge achievements, and everyone fulfills their responsibilities and does their own work, there will definitely be a satisfactory answer within ten years. We are now embarking on a rejuvenation movement that should last at least ten years. Ten years is just a page and a half in the history of rejuvenation. It is not a long time. We should not be anxious, just bury our heads and do it. Now I will give two examples as good role models for us to complete ordinary work in extraordinary times. The first good example is within the country. Everyone was very happy when they heard the news of the victory in the Suiyuan resistance, thinking that this was an extraordinary achievement. But we should know that this victory of the Suiyuan soldiers came from ordinary efforts. They had already made preparations for the final sacrifice in peacetime, and they were constantly burying their heads in building strong camps. They were unwilling to act rashly and cause trouble, and they were unwilling to relax their responsibilities and miss the opportunity to prepare. Seeing that the time for the final sacrifice had come, they

Sacrificed Their Lives to Fight to the Death, Not Afraid of Being Isolated at All. Intensifying preparations for war in peacetime and calmly responding in wartime, this spirit should be possessed by every citizen. General Fu Zuoyi's two sentences to his soldiers, "We do not provoke trouble, but we are never afraid of trouble," are the basis for this victory. Not provoking trouble is a good lesson in calm preparation, and not being afraid of trouble is a good lesson in resolute sacrifice. If everyone can follow these two very ordinary sentences, they can establish extraordinary achievements and become immortal national heroes in history. The second good example is abroad. Everyone admires the achievements of Italy's revival, always thinking that they used some clever methods. But they do not know that their approach is also very ordinary. After the European War, Italy's national crisis was indeed very serious. Financial chaos, economic decline, stagnation of industry and commerce, and almost no way to deal with finances. However, Stefano, the first Minister of Finance in Mussolini's cabinet, was not anxious. Starting from his inauguration on November 1, 1922, he worked until the third year, and the financial difficulties were broken through. The construction of the national economy was also

Leaps and Bounds, establishing a solid foundation for the rule of the Fascist Party, and finally creating the great cause of reviving Italy. How did he do it? It is also very ordinary, and everyone can do it. He said when he took office, "I have no profound theories to say. From now on, everything will be carried out to effectively solve the current facts. My policy is very simple and very ordinary, that is, those who should pay taxes should pay taxes, and those who should not be spent should not be spent, eliminating corruption and increasing financial effectiveness." Now this Mr. Stefano has come to our country as a financial advisor. What we should learn first is his extremely ordinary approach, and his understanding of effectively solving the current facts. The people of the country should remember that General Fu Zuoyi was able to lead his soldiers to establish extraordinary achievements only because he was able to fulfill his due responsibilities in peacetime. Stefano was able to help Mussolini establish the great achievement of reviving Italy only because he was able to fulfill his due responsibilities. A person who leads troops, if he cannot first fulfill his responsibility as commander, train his troops, strictly observe discipline, and obey orders, but

Talk Lofty Politics and dream of an unparalleled hero, will surely cause great chaos. A politician, or someone who leads public opinion, if he cannot first fulfill his inherent responsibility, enlighten the people's knowledge, and cultivate the people's common sense, but prides himself on being extraordinary and likes to be innovative, will surely harm himself and others, and cause losses to the country and society. A young student, if he cannot first fulfill his responsibility to study hard, absorb new knowledge, and acquire common sense, but only relies on passionate impulse to boast of saving the country, he will surely go astray, at least he will only have enthusiasm for saving the country, but no real strength to save the country. Therefore, we must first start with ordinary undertakings. When we complete our ordinary responsibilities, we can then establish extraordinary achievements. I hope that all compatriots who are determined to deal with extraordinary events will pay attention to this extremely ordinary one. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Military Situation in the Far East

--- Yi

Judging from the recent international situation, Europe seems to be more tense than the Far East. The great victory of the Spanish government forces in the past few days has made Italy and Germany even more anxious. In order to save face, those two major fascist countries may push the crisis of war again.

However, regardless of whether the future cruel war will first break out in Europe, we in the Far East cannot be complacent. We must know that the global arms race has made the peace of any corner of the earth unsafe. Moreover, since the establishment of the Japan-Germany Pact, the crisis in Europe will immediately lead to a crisis in the Far East.

Let's not talk about Japan's ambition still targeting our mainland. Just by reviewing the international military deployment in the Far East, we can know that our surroundings are no longer a peaceful paradise.

Let's start with the north. The Soviet Union's Far East defense has been built to a point where it can maintain its military independence. Forts have been built everywhere on the border, and barracks have been built that experts estimate can accommodate 200,000 to 300,000 troops. The double-track project of the entire Siberian line has also been completed. In our east, it goes without saying that the Japanese authorities have decided to take every last bit of the people's wealth to expand their military preparations. As for the South Seas, the Philippine government has proposed a national military service plan to train 400,000 troops before gaining independence. The Siamese government cannot maintain financial balance due to its efforts to expand its military preparations. Britain has built a strong naval and air base in Singapore at a cost of 30 million pounds. A large-scale exercise was conducted there not long ago. The Dutch East Indies and French Indochina have also recently increased local military spending considerably.

These Far Eastern countries' expansion of military preparations is all caused by Japan's continental policy. If Japan's policy continues to develop in a straight line, the situation of the arms race will inevitably turn into a cruel war at any time. Our country is particularly dangerous due to its location. We really cannot neglect extraordinary vigilance in the slightest.

### Finance Minister Yuki Again Advocates Maintaining Sino-Japanese Friendship

Developing Economic Relations with China Depends on Private Efforts Kodama Asks Acting Chargé d'Affaires Yang to Convey His Gratitude for the Warm Reception

[Tokyo] Japanese Finance Minister Toyotaro Yuki gave a speech yesterday at a reception hosted by the Osaka Economic Association, saying that the economic development of Japan, whether it is the development of production or the expansion of commerce, fundamentally requires the maintenance of friendly relations between China and Japan. Up to now, although there may have been unreasonable actions on the Chinese side, we also have made mistakes. I believe that the recent economic survey mission to China has made a huge contribution. President Jiang of the Chinese Executive Yuan said at the reception, "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Although the true meaning of this sentence can be interpreted differently, according to what I have heard, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was unusually amiable when he said this. Sino-Japanese friendship is difficult to establish with one day's effort, so both sides must consider each other's position. In particular, we should change our past feelings towards China. In short, I believe that the task of the Finance Minister today is to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, and this especially requires the efforts of Osaka. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)

[Tokyo] Kenji Kodama, accompanied by Kyoichi Aburaya and Tatsuichiro Funatsu, visited the Chinese Embassy in Japan at 9 a.m. this morning. They were received by Acting Chargé d'Affaires Yang Yunzhu.

### Japanese Prime Minister Plans to Form a New Party

Konoe is Unwilling to Serve as Party Leader Political Stalemate Not Easily Broken

[Tokyo] Hayashi Senjuro visited Konoe Fumimaro this morning to exchange views on the issue of forming a new party. It is heard that Mr. Hayashi expressed the following opinions to Konoe: ㊀ In view of the attitude of the existing political parties to counterattack the government after the dissolution of the House of Representatives, the opposition between domestic reformers and those who maintain the status quo will inevitably intensify. Therefore, the government will fall into a serious dilemma, that is, either order the dissolution of the parliament for the second time, or resign unanimously when the special parliament meets. ㊁ In order to appease this crisis, it is necessary to form a new party to unite all pro-government elements in both factions. ㊂ As past experience has shown, the most important difficulty in forming a new party is the lack of a strong leader. Hayashi Senjuro himself is a soldier and is not very familiar with politics. Therefore, he hopes that Konoe will come forward to call for it. ㊃ If Konoe does not accept this request, then he will urge other figures such as Hirota or Yuki to come forward. What does he think? Regarding points one and two, it is heard that Konoe completely agrees with Hayashi Senjuro, especially with the need to form a new party. However, he still expressed his unwillingness to serve as party leader at present. Konoe's refusal is obviously based on the view that even if a new party appears now, victory is still not guaranteed. Konoe has a great future political life and is naturally unwilling to risk being a sacrifice. As for how Konoe responded to Hayashi Senjuro's fourth point of view, the outside world does not know. However, Yuki is generally considered to be a symbolic figure of the so-called military-financial coalition policy in Japan today. He should devote all his efforts to his existing suitable position and should not participate in party struggles, so as to expand political friction. As for Hirota, although he once held the position of Prime Minister, he has more political enemies than supporters, even in the ruling class. Therefore, Hirota's hope of success is extremely low. Hayashi Senjuro's successive visits to Hiranuma and Konoe fully demonstrate the cabinet's anxiety about breaking the political stalemate and the scarcity of possibilities to break this stalemate.

### Army Minister Sugiyama Encourages Officers Most

Unite in Cooperation to Promote National Destiny

[Tokyo] Today, active-duty officers and reserve officers held a forum at the Army Toyama School. The number of participants reached more than 600, which is a rare grand event. The three senior officials and key figures of the Central Military Department, as well as military commanders and division commanders, all participated. It can be said to be a general meeting of the army. Therefore, Army Minister Sugiyama's speech has attracted general attention. The main points of the Army Minister's speech are recorded below: ㊀ He frankly revealed the ambiguity of relations with the Soviet Union and the current situation of the China issue. ㊁ He pointed out the lack of domestic understanding and the lack of national spirit, and clarified that the current army has progressed from the driving force of promoting national destiny to the forefront. ㊂ In order to implement the plan to enrich military preparations, the government and the public, the military and the people must cooperate to promote the leapfrog development of the metaphysical and physical national comprehensive capabilities, which is the most important thing. ㊃ Therefore, it is decided to make the country's political affairs new, and all national affairs should be based on enriching national defense.

### India Proposes Adjusting Maritime Transport to Japan

Japan Opposes Holding a Meeting; Advocates Resolution by the Private Sector

[Tokyo] The Indian Ministry of Commerce has formally proposed to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that British and Japanese shipping companies convene to adjust the ratio of Indian cargo shipments. Japanese newspapers widely regard this news as important. Rumors circulate that India intends to prohibit Japanese ships from calling at Indian ports. Sino-Foreign Commercial News criticizes this matter, stating that since the Japanese government began encouraging shipping with subsidies, Japanese ships have made astonishing progress in Indian trade. Competition between British and Japanese shipping has thus intensified. It is noted that Japanese carriers now transport 70% of the goods between the Far East and India. The Japanese shipping industry's attitude is extremely tough, unwilling to concede in the slightest. This can be seen from the fact that no shipping representative participated in the economic survey mission to Britain. The Asahi Shimbun reports that the Director of the Ship Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications does not support holding a meeting, believing that the relevant British and Japanese shipping companies should negotiate the matter themselves. (Central News Agency, 8th, Reuters)

[Tokyo] Regarding the proposal by Indian representative Mr. Dowd to the Japanese government to convene a British-Japanese maritime transport conference, Japanese private shipping companies believe that this issue should be resolved by the British and Japanese private sectors. The British side intends to negotiate this issue through government channels, which must have some ulterior motive. Mr. Ono, the Director of the Ship Administration Bureau, said regarding this issue: Mr. Dowd's proposal mentioned the issue of Japanese ships sailing along the Indian coast. However, there should be no problem with Japanese ships voluntarily restraining their navigation. As for a maritime transport conference, although the Indian side has this intention, this conference should be resolved independently by the private sector and is not a matter for government mediation.

### London China Association Holds Annual Meeting

Chairman Bernard Delivers Speech, Praising China's Construction Achievements

[London] At today's annual meeting of the China Association, Chairman Bernard stated in his speech that Foreign Minister Sato's expression in the House of Lords on March 8th of his willingness to adjust relations with China was extremely important. Sato intends to reconsider the North China issue in order to reach a compromise solution, which is also noteworthy. Japan's policy toward China now clearly intends to change course. If this becomes a reality, then we hope that the Chinese government and people will meet Japan halfway. Mr. Bernard then congratulated the Chinese government on the many construction projects completed in recent years, as well as the many construction plans underway, among which the most noteworthy is the improvement of the living conditions of farmers, as this move is sufficient to prevent communism, etc. Subsequently, Mr. Schweitzer was elected as the new chairman of the association, and Mr. Baker was elected as the vice chairman.

### London Negotiations to Improve the Current Economic Situation

Britain, America, and France Do Not Agree; Holding a World Conference Is Not Yet Timely

[London] The World Sugar Conference is currently being held here, and representatives from various countries have held informal talks on the world economic situation on several occasions. However, it seems there is still little hope of convening a world economic conference at present. It is heard that among the representatives of various countries, the American representative Mr. White now advocates that economic negotiations be conducted between countries, and says that the United States supports any initiative to reduce tariff barriers. As for Britain, because it has largely restored its economic position before the European War by means of the current bilateral commercial treaty system, it does not want to make any changes. As for France, it believes that economic issues are closely related to political issues and that economic issues can only be resolved after political issues are resolved. The French representatives also believe that the British and French governments have entrusted Belgian Prime Minister Celan to study whether it is possible to reduce tariff barriers and abolish import quotas between countries. The results of the study will not be difficult to clearly understand the intentions of the major European countries. In short, as of now, what the London negotiations have revealed is that the representatives of various countries are currently "doing something," which is worthy of praise. That is all. In addition, the representatives of various countries seem to hope that representatives of other countries will put forward practical suggestions, but it is too early to talk about achieving concrete results at present. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas)

[London] The American representative attending the World Sugar Conference, Mr. Davis, will visit Foreign Secretary Eden this week (the 9th of this month) to discuss various international issues. According to observers, Britain generally takes a wait-and-see attitude toward general international political issues. Although the interim meetings of the Council and General Assembly of the League of Nations are scheduled to be heard at the end of next month, the London side does not attach importance to this meeting, so Britain will not put forward any suggestions at that time. In addition, France does not seem to have any surprising initiatives and aims to reduce armaments. As for the international economy, the chief representative of France attending the World Sugar Conference, the Minister of Economy, Mr. Spinasse, is scheduled to meet with Mr. Davis, British Minister of Commerce, Mr. Runciman, and Foreign Secretary Eden tomorrow to explain the true meaning of the fact that Belgian Prime Minister Celan has been entrusted by Britain and France to study the possibility of removing international trade barriers. It is heard that the importance of Prime Minister Celan's mission is not as great as rumored. However, if the World Sugar Conference is successful, then more active economic talks between countries can often begin, but at present, the future of the Sugar Conference is still bleak. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas)

### International Sugar Conference

Possible to Conclude an Agreement; Philippine Representative's Actions Worth Noting

[London] According to the general impression, the result of the World Sugar Conference may be the conclusion of an international sugar agreement. However, this agreement will be particularly beneficial to Britain, as the Sugar Conference will inevitably recognize that the rate of increase in sugar consumption in Britain will only be supplied by the production of the UK proper and its various overseas dominions and colonies.

When the presidium of the Sugar Conference met this afternoon, it pointed out that the total amount of sugar needed by various importing countries in 1937 was 3,170,000 tons, which is less than the estimates in previous years. Therefore, the amount of sugar exported will inevitably decrease. If this estimated amount is confirmed by the Sugar Conference, then one of the tasks of the representatives of various countries will be to decide how much the exporting countries should reduce their export volume in order to offset the reduced demand, so that the supply and demand of sugar can be offset. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas)

[London] The World Sugar Conference Secretariat decided today to recommend to the General Assembly that the total world sugar production for 1936 to 1937 be set at 3,170,000 tons. In mid-March, the World Sugar Production Committee recommended that the sugar production required by the world free market be 3,250,000 tons. The current proposed recommendation is advocated by the Committee of Statistical Experts, which is 80,000 tons lower than the estimate in March. The World Sugar Conference will now find a way to allocate this reduced quantity to the countries attending the meeting. (Central News Agency, 7th, Reuters)

[London] Diplomatic circles today are paying close attention to the Philippine representative in the American delegation to the World Sugar Conference, Mr. Boncajon. If Mr. Boncajon's actions establish a diplomatic precedent, then this achievement will be even more important to the Philippines than the establishment of a sugar agreement. President Roosevelt has authorized Mr. Boncajon to sign any agreement on behalf of the island, so Mr. Boncajon is the first diplomatic representative in Philippine history. People at the meeting all call him the Franklin of the Philippines. At today's secret meeting, Mr. Boncajon's proposals for the Philippines were straightforward, much like the American diplomatic approach. British Privy Councillor MacDonald and Secretary of the Colonies, Mr. Ormsby-Gore, expressed their deep appreciation. (7th, Kuomintang Telegraph)

### Germany Expresses Approval for Removing Trade Barriers

However, Raw Materials and Debt Must Be Resolved First

[Berlin] Regarding the British and French governments' request that Belgian Prime Minister Celan conduct negotiations to remove various barriers to international trade, the German Foreign Communications Newspaper recently stated: "Germany is prepared to participate in all efforts that can make the world economy healthier. However, Germany must resolve the three issues of foreign debt, colonies, and raw materials before taking this action. This should also be recognized worldwide. In addition, the stability of Germany's currency exchange rate should also be guaranteed." (Central News Agency, 8th, Havas)

### US Treasury Department Statement: Gold Purchase Policy Unchanged

Widespread Rumors that the US Will Raise the Value of the Dollar Cause Panic in European Financial Circles

[Washington] As reports from New York and London indicated that the US Treasury Department would suppress gold prices, senior Treasury officials stated today that the US government's gold purchase policy has not changed. It is also known that most banks now feel that it is unprofitable to buy gold, because the overseas gold price is only slightly different from the Treasury Department's fixed gold price of $35 per ounce. (7th, Kuomintang Telegraph)

[London] This question recently caused extreme panic in financial circles in London and on the continent because it received a report from New York that American banks had notified their London agents that they would no longer transport gold on behalf of the US Treasury and would not borrow against gold in transit. Although the American Bank of London denied this rumor, people outside were still extremely panicked, and groups dumped gold and its chemical products. Later, news came from Washington that the US government's policy of purchasing gold had not changed, nor was there any intention to change it, and other agency fees were handled as usual, and the situation began to ease. (Central News Agency, 7th, Reuters)

[London] Yesterday, rumors spread that American banks would no longer accept gold shipped to the United States on behalf of the US Treasury, nor would they release loans secured by gold in transit. This caused great panic in financial circles here and in Europe. Although US officials later denied that there would be changes in the US gold policy, the impact of the panic has not yet disappeared. Londoners believe that the denial by US officials is credible, at least for the time being, but the forces of natural economics are now making the dollar stronger, and will eventually force the US gold policy to be revised. The current value of the dollar when converted into pounds sterling is indeed too low. If the price of the dollar does not rise, then the value of the British and French currencies will be further reduced, and the gold price in Britain and France will be increased. However, this level may not be realized because it will contribute to the trend of world inflation. The price of the dollar today is still rising when calculated in pounds sterling and French francs. The main reason is purchases in Paris. The London gold price is one penny lower than the US price today. There were a few buyers after the listing, but not many sellers. Today, the prices of various goods have gradually improved compared to yesterday. (Central News Agency, 8th, Reuters)

[Washington] London has recently spread rumors that the price of the dollar will be raised frequently. Informed sources in the United States were very surprised to hear this, believing that it would be inappropriate to conduct such an experiment at this time. Because after the price of the dollar is raised, the prices of various raw materials will fall, and the trend of rising prices of other goods and wages will also be stopped. Labor-capital disputes will be difficult to resolve, and both agricultural and industrial circles will strongly oppose it. Regarding this matter, the Federal Financial Market Supervision Committee has studied various measures with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Treasury Department to prevent foreign gold coins and funds from continuing to flow into the United States, but the measures agreed upon have not been approved by President Roosevelt, and the official side has refused to publish the content, so it is impossible for outsiders to know. (Central News Agency, 8th, Havas)

### US Senator Proposes Convening a World Peace Conference

To Save the War Crisis; Believes the Time Is Ripe

[Washington] Democratic Senator Lewis proposed today in the Senate that the United States convene a world peace conference, saying that the United States has a precedent for acting as an international arbitrator, and it must now work hard to prevent a new world war. He feels that the time has come, and the US President should convene a world peace conference for the countries that signed the Treaty of Versailles. (Central News Agency, 7th, Reuters)

### Philippine President Quezon Visits Mexico

Pays Special Attention to Agriculture and Mining

[Washington] Well-informed observers said that Philippine President Quezon's trip to Mexico will pay special attention to rural improvement in Mexico, because Mr. Quezon has a deep desire to improve the Philippine countryside. Therefore, he pays close attention to the land policies of Mexico and the Irish Free State that favor small farmers. Observers believe that the political unrest in the Philippines mostly originates in rural areas, so the Philippine national economy should be based on benefiting small farmers. Mr. Quezon will also pay great attention to Mexico's mining industry, because the Philippines' mining industry has been developing recently. (7th, Kuomintang Telegraph)

### Britain Has No Intention of Revising the Naval Treaty

Eden States in the House of Commons

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden recently replied to a question from a Labour MP in the House of Commons, saying that although the Japanese government has refused to limit the 14-inch caliber of capital ship guns, he does not believe that last year's London Naval Treaty has actually lost its value. The Foreign Secretary continued to reply to questions from other MPs, saying that the British government does not intend to request the countries concerned to revise the contents of the naval treaty.

### Belgium Lifts Locarno Treaty Obligations

Britain and France Have No Objections

[London] It is heard that Britain and France have been discussing because Belgium wants to lift the obligations of the Locarno Treaty. Both sides have no objections in principle to this matter and are currently considering the draft of an appropriate document. It is expected that Britain and France will grant Belgium's request. (Central News Agency, 7th, Reuters)

### Soviet Ambassador to France

Replaced by Suritz

[Moscow] After Soviet Ambassador to France, Mr. Potemkin, was transferred to Deputy Commissioner of Foreign Affairs the other day, his vacant post was recently taken over by Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Suritz. Mr. Suritz is 55 years old this year, studied at the University of Berlin, and began participating in the Russian revolutionary movement at the age of 20. He was arrested and imprisoned several times and exiled to Siberia. In 1917, he joined the Communist Party. The following year, he was appointed as an attaché at the Danish Embassy. In 1919, he was transferred back to the country to serve on the Industrial and Commercial Committee. After three months, he was reappointed as the Ambassador to Afghanistan. In 1922, he was transferred to Minister to Norway. The following year, he was appointed as Ambassador to Turkey. In 1933, he was elected as a member of the Soviet Central Executive Committee. In 1934, he was transferred to Ambassador to Germany, and stayed in that position until now. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas)

### Polish People Demonstrate Against Germany

Demanding the Return of Lost Territories; German Government Protests

[Berlin] German Ambassador to Poland, Mr. Moltke, was recently authorized to protest to the Polish government about the demonstration held by the Polish National Defense League in Grudziądz (in the Polish Corridor), believing it to be a hostile attitude towards Germany. On the day of the parade, the crowd shouted slogans such as Poland should recover the land lost to Germany, and there were the following slogans, such as ㊀ "Grudziądz is the future capital of the recovered land," ㊁ "Sarro County (now German territory) must be returned to the motherland," etc. Therefore, the German newspapers today commented on this very demand, which caused a diplomatic protest, in lengthy articles. The German Foreign Policy Review Newspaper stated that the tranquility achieved by the German-Polish Ten-Year Treaty should never be broken by unilateral emotional actions, and pointed out that the Grudziądz incident was a sign of unreasonable greed. This kind of sign cannot strengthen Germany's belief. The newspaper concluded that although this matter has caused diplomatic negotiations, it has not changed the German-Polish relationship that has been maintained in Germany since 1923.

### Italian and German Troops Fighting in the Spanish Civil War Creates International Tension

Spanish Rebel Authorities Apologize to Britain for the Bombing of the British Ship "Sky"

[London] The international tension is getting closer to the point of eruption. European peace is hanging by a thread. The following points are all gradually dangerous facts:

㊀ Britain has sent the destroyer "Gallant" directly to protest to the leader of the Spanish Nationalist Army about the bombing of the destroyer "Brazen" by Nationalist Army aircraft yesterday. ㊁ Britain suspects that the above-mentioned bombing was carried out by Italian aircraft. ㊂ The Spanish government army claims that the German battleship "Königsberg" cooperated with the rebels and "bombed Santoña on Wednesday." ㊃ The government army claims that the German cruiser "Leipzig" followed the government fleet and notified the rebels on land of its actions. ㊄ The Italian daily newspaper replied that France and Russia send volunteers to Spain every day, and said that French officers are in command of the government army. ㊅ The Paris Evening News said that 300 Germans were captured in Villa de Hada. ㊅ Semi-official sources in Rome stated that the Spanish ship "Manegro" was sailing from Odessa, Russia, to the Spanish border with 25 tanks, 20 aircraft, and 30 trucks, and had passed the Turkish coast. (7th, Kuomintang Telegraph)

The ship fired at one of the aircraft, which flew away as a result. Afterwards, the British cruiser "Shropshire" sailed to Palma to negotiate with the Nationalist Army authorities. The Nationalist Army leader, General, has now apologized, saying that the Nationalist Army aircraft must have mistaken the "Brazen" for a Spanish government warship. He has ordered his air force to identify which country the ship belongs to before approaching any ship in the future. (Central News Agency, 8th, Reuters)

### Supervision of the Spanish Civil War

Difficult to Implement Immediately

[London] Regarding the various supervisory measures for non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, according to general predictions, they may not be able to be implemented before next week. Although most of the inspectors at various borders and ports have already departed from London, it will take some time to organize the internal structure of the supervisory offices in various places and train the staff, so it is difficult to implement all the supervisory measures on a set day. As for the Soviet government's request to send an investigation team to Spain to investigate Italy's interference in the civil war and to withdraw volunteers from various countries currently in Spain, the investigation committee will not discuss and study it until after the supervisory measures are implemented.

It is becoming one of the most brutal chapters in the history of the Spanish Civil War. The Nationalist forces claim that after several months of fierce fighting, they have buried 876 government soldiers, captured 960 alive, and treated 116 wounded in hospitals.

Furthermore, the Nationalist forces in the Otxandio area have been bombarding Basque positions for a day and a half continuously. The Nationalist forces have advanced to between Otxandio and Durango, but the government forces have counterattacked from Otxandio.

According to reports from the government forces, the Nationalist attack on the Basque region today was the most intense offensive to date, supported by thirty German bombers, with bombs raining down like rain. However, the Basque militias are fighting back with machine guns and hand grenades, fighting bravely without fear. The Nationalist forces also claim that the Urkiola mountain pass between Otxandio and Durango has been occupied by the Nationalist forces, but the government forces deny this.

The Arab religious leader declared that the Arab nation is a single family across the world, and Palestine is an indivisible part of it. The Jewish people advocate establishing a Jewish state on both sides of the Jordan River (i.e., the entire territory of Palestine), so they also oppose the plan proposed by the British Royal Commission.

### Japanese Building Wharf in Shantou

Lingdong Commercial School's Coast Forcibly Occupied; Japanese Warship Arrives in Shantou Related to the Case

Shantou Dispatch: In recent years, Sino-Japanese negotiation cases have continuously occurred in Shantou City, all stemming from the investigation and seizure of smuggled goods. The Japanese side considers itself to be in a special position, while our side adheres to the principle of maintaining sovereignty, resulting in most negotiation matters becoming pending issues. Last month, Yamazaki, the Japanese consul stationed in Shantou, visited Mayor Huang Bingxun several times to discuss resolving all past pending cases in a reasonable manner and restoring normal relations between the two countries. Unexpectedly, just as negotiations were underway, the Japanese side created further complications. The Shantou Public Security Bureau arrested two gamblers, Wang and Lin, and the Japanese consul openly demanded their extradition. Since Wang and Lin are not Japanese nationals, and the Public Security Bureau did not arrest them in a foreign firm, the Japanese consul had no reason to demand their extradition. However, due to this case, the progress of resolving the pending cases was once again stalled. Before one wave subsides, another rises. The coast of the Provincial Lingdong Type A Commercial School, formerly Tongwen College, had long been determined to be the school's property. After the founding of the Republic of China, it was gradually filled in, and over 100 commercial street houses were built. The coast at the end of the commercial street still belongs to the school. The land bureau, education department, and municipal government all have registered deeds to verify this. However, a Japanese national, Luo Bingzhang (originally from Zhejiang, the owner of Sanlin Company), claimed to have purchased 150 zhang of the coast at the entrance of the commercial street from Xiao Lunwu from Dapu in the first year of the Republic of China. In the past, attempts to occupy the land and build a wharf were opposed and thwarted by the commercial school. Recently, Luo suddenly entered into a contract with the Japanese national Nakahara Construction Company to fill in the coast and build a wharf at a cost of 100,000 yuan, scheduled to begin construction soon. At the same time, the Osaka Merchant Shipping Company of Japan, citing the reason of facilitating the loading and unloading of passengers and cargo in Shantou, decided to build a wharf and warehouse at the end of the commercial street and applied to the municipal government's engineering department for a construction permit. The municipal government sent personnel to investigate the site and confirmed that the ownership of the coast belongs to the commercial school. In the early years of the Republic of China, Xiao Lunwu illegally sold it to Luo Bingzhang. Ten years ago, two lawsuits were filed, and the Chenghai County, Guangdong Provincial Government Office, and Shantou Tribunal ruled that Xiao Lunwu's illegal sale was invalid. The files and newspaper records at the time are verifiable. Luo Bingzhang and Xiao Lunwu are still alive today and are not comparable to matters that occurred a long time ago. The Shantou Municipal Government has already replied to the Osaka Company rejecting the application, and the Japanese consul has not responded. However, two days ago, the Japanese nationals suddenly sent surveyors to the coast to measure the depth of the sea and the area of the coast, freely drawing diagrams, intending to forcibly occupy and start construction without our permission. The commercial school, witnessing the attempt to seize school property, was extremely indignant. On the first of this month, it specifically telegraphed the Provincial Education Department to request the Provincial Government to instruct the Shantou Municipal Government not to issue a construction permit, to revoke the false deed of ownership, and to send a letter to the municipal government, advising it to take effective measures to stop foreigners from arbitrarily filling in the land. Mayor Huang Bingxun considered the matter to be significant and that the Japanese attempt to build a wharf in Shantou has been going on for more than a day. Whenever there are negotiations between the two countries, the Japanese side proposes building a wharf as one of the conditions, such as the Kakuta Longevity Hospital, which also requested building a wharf at the intersection of Shenzhao Road. The attempt to seize the commercial school's property did not begin today. Therefore, he telegraphed the province in detail about the entire case and requested instructions on the negotiation strategy. A Japanese warship, Asakaze, is currently docked in Shantou waters. Wada, commander of the Taiwan Naval Base, visited Shantou on March 25th. It is rumored that he will lead a warship to Shantou again on the 7th of this month, which is said to be related to the forced construction of the wharf. The local people are eagerly hoping that the government will have a good way to deal with the situation to avoid causing a serious incident. (3rd)

### Tianjin Customs Stipulates Measures for Inspecting Smuggled Goods

Registration Period for Smuggled Goods Extended to May 9th; Businesses in All Concessions are Also Subject to Inspection

Tianjin Dispatch: Tianjin Customs previously stipulated that the deadline for inspecting smuggled goods stored in Tianjin's city was the end of March. Before this deadline, all businesses with smuggled goods had to report them by filling out forms to the city chamber of commerce, which would then forward them to customs for inspection. All quantities of goods would be strictly checked, and taxes would be supplemented and sales would be permitted. However, when the deadline arrived, very few businesses complied with filling out forms and reporting. Most businesses believed that ㊀ the customs inspection of smuggled goods would only be conducted in the Chinese area, and businesses in the concessions would be exempt. As a result, businesses in the concessions would take advantage of the inspection of businesses in the Chinese area to dump smuggled goods more aggressively. Consequently, customs would not be able to achieve the effect of clearing out smuggled goods but would instead help the concessions become a swamp, increasing their prosperity. Businesses in the Chinese area would become increasingly untenable. Therefore, if an inspection were to be conducted, it should be done in the entire city, regardless of the Chinese area or the concessions, so that businesses in the Chinese area would not be uniquely affected. ㊁ Although stores and shops would be inspected, small vendors would escape the net and continue to sell as before. The sale of smuggled goods would only be cut off for a few large businesses, while small vendors would take advantage of the opportunity to sell at low prices. Therefore, small vendors must be inspected together. The above two reasons were presented by Wang Wendian and Wang Xiaoyan, permanent members of the city chamber of commerce, during a visit to Customs Commissioner May Weiliang for consultation. May also felt that the reasons held by the businesses were quite legitimate and dispatched Tax Bureau officers Li Zumao and Luo Qingxiang to exchange views with the various committees of the chamber of commerce. Only yesterday was it decided that customs would contact the various concessions to conduct inspections of smuggled goods belonging to Chinese businesses. However, the Chinese area must be addressed first before it can be implemented. Only because the procedures for dealing with small vendors are cumbersome and difficult to complete in a short time has the deadline been extended to September 9th. Starting on the 10th, customs will begin inspections. In order to enable businesses to register quickly, customs drafted six articles of measures and sent them to the chamber of commerce on the 6th to inform the various industries. The city chamber of commerce has scheduled a meeting of the various industries at 3 pm on the 7th to decide how to register quickly. Li Xing, director of the Smuggling Suppression Headquarters of the Ministry of Finance Road Transport, returned to Tianjin from Beijing on the 6th to assist customs in carrying out the inspection of smuggled goods. Currently, the various smuggling businesses in the concessions are extremely panicked, fearing that the customs matter and the concession authorities will agree to conduct inspections of shops in the concessions. When that time comes, there will be no place to hide the smuggled goods, and if businesses in the concessions dare not sell smuggled goods on commission, their outlets will shrink further. On the 6th, six shops, including the Japanese-owned smuggling foreign firm Nitto, sent representatives to Customs to meet with May Weiliang, expressing their willingness to supplement taxes on their inventory, and the customs would not force them to pursue the matter, so that they could transport and sell them abroad. The customs are considering a reply.

The original text of the measures for registering accumulated smuggled goods drafted by Tianjin Customs is as follows: ㊀ Businesses in the Chinese and concession areas of the city should start registering accumulated smuggled goods with the city chamber of commerce from April 10th of this year until May 9th. During the above period, all smuggled goods registered by businesses will be subject to customs duties in accordance with regulations. ㊁ Wholesale merchants should submit import declarations to the city chamber of commerce, which will then forward them to customs. The color, weight, and value of all goods must be detailed in the declaration for verification purposes. The name and address of the declarant and store should also be listed together, and the chamber of commerce must certify in the declaration that there are no errors. The location where the goods will be inspected in the future will be determined on a case-by-case basis, whether at the declarant's store or transported to customs. Special inspection fees or consular visa fees for cargo lists, and Changhe construction fees and bridge fees will be waived to show special consideration. ㊂ Retail merchants should report the number of accumulated smuggled goods to the relevant trade association, which will then report them to the chamber of commerce. After receiving the report, the trade association should list each item in an import declaration, send it to the chamber of commerce for certification that there are no errors, and then submit it to customs together with a table of the names and addresses of the registered retail merchants for inspection. However, since the scattered goods are sold continuously, the quantity stored cannot be the same every day. This fact must also be taken into account during inspection. The amount of the registered retail goods should be paid in full by each trade association, and then reimbursed by the relevant retail merchants at any time. (If the chamber of commerce believes that there are omissions, it may formulate specific measures separately and send them to customs for verification for adoption. (For retail shops that have not registered with the chamber of commerce, customs may send personnel to search at any time and seize their smuggled goods. If the chamber of commerce is aware of any shops selling smuggled goods, it should report them to customs at any time for investigation and seizure. ㊃ After this registration, each business should prepare a ledger to detail the name and quantity of goods purchased each month, as well as all the circumstances of which shop purchased them. If it is a wholesale business, it must also detail the situation of direct imports from abroad in the ledger for customs to send personnel to check at any time. When necessary, the customs may also check whether the goods and ledgers of the shop are consistent. However, the number of goods sold each day may be deducted to verify accuracy. Permission is also granted for the chamber of commerce to jointly inspect with the customs. ㊄ In the future, all new wholesale or retail businesses opened in the city should register with the chamber of commerce, and the chamber of commerce should submit a report to the customs for verification. ㊅ Customs may investigate and seize any shops that have not registered with the chamber of commerce after May 9th of this year in accordance with regulations to enforce the law.

### Hangzhou-Cao'e Section to Lay Tracks on May 1st

—Scheduled to be Completed by the End of June—

Hangzhou Dispatch: The earthwork for the Hangzhou-Cao'e section has been completed 90%, and it should be completed for the entire section within days. The steel beams for the 76 small bridges will arrive in Shanghai on the 10th of this month, and they will be transferred for installation immediately and are scheduled to be completed by the end of June. The steel beams for the Cao'e River Bridge are expected to arrive around August 15th and are expected to be erected by September 20th. Because the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway plans to run through trains to Guangdong, except for the section from the Qiantang River Bridge to Xiaoshan, which uses 85-pound new rails, the rest of the line uses 75-pound heavy rails. The section from Shanghai South Station to Jiaxing is currently being replaced with 85-pound new rails. The replaced 75-pound old rails will be moved to the Hangzhou-Cao'e section for laying. The section requires a total of 8,000 tons of rails, and 2,000 tons of old rails have been transported to Xiaoshan, ready for laying. The entire section requires approximately 70,000 sleepers, which will be shipped to Shanghai in mid-month.

Due to the dry weather and the presence of thatched sheds, although the town's fire brigade rushed to the rescue, it was not easy to extinguish the fire immediately. It took more than three hours to extinguish it. As a result, more than 30 thatched sheds and tiled houses were destroyed, with losses estimated at approximately 20,000 yuan.

Farmer's Fish Stolen, Causing Trouble

Yao Ada, a farmer from Xinan Township in the third district of the county, bought 65 catties of fresh fish, packed them in a bamboo basket, and placed them in the Mantou River behind his house for the banquet dishes on the 7th. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 5th, Shen Quantang, who made a living by fishing, sailed by the area. On the morning of the 6th at about 3 am, Yao caught a glimpse of a fishing boat's starlight and examined the fish he had raised, but it had disappeared without a trace. He believed that Shen had stolen it and shouted to catch the thief, chasing him to Xinan Bridge. He then went to report to the police station in charge. At that time, all the farmers in the village knew about it, and suddenly shot Shen with a hunting gun, hitting him in the face. He fell to the ground bleeding profusely. The police then escorted the person and boat to the city. After examination by the county, Jin Yao Ada was temporarily detained. Shen Quantang's injuries are quite severe and his life is in danger.

Afterwards, the suspicious people seemed to have been discovered and fled towards Hupu. The township head then telegraphed the Hupu authorities to pay attention. It is said that since the January 28th Incident, traitors have been hiding in the area, but fortunately, they have been prevented and have not succeeded.

Therefore, the association has scheduled a general meeting of members at the association's location at Huangfeiji on the afternoon of the 18th of this month at 1 pm to re-elect the president and vice president.

Chamber of Commerce Studies Income Tax

The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce is holding an income tax study class to study income tax. It has sent letters to the trade associations of various industries to send personnel to the meeting for study. It is scheduled to open tomorrow (the 10th) for a period of two months. If there are achievements, the class will continue to be held. By the 8th, the various industries have sent letters reporting that they have recommended more than 100 auditors, and the chamber of commerce has hired accountant He Laiyuan as the director.

Construction of New Suzhou Progressing

The county's plan to build a new Suzhou has been approved by the county government and submitted to the provincial government.

### Wuxi

Sixty-Three-Year-Old Man Marries

Sun Xingcha, a resident of Qianzhou Town in the ninth district of the county, is now 63 years old. He has successively served as the manager of Sun Taifeng Sauce Garden in the town and the accountant of a large Shanghai hotel. Although Sun's hair is gray, he is fond of women and no less than a young man. Recently, through the introduction of his daughter Fangying, he married a spinster from the southern outskirts of the county, who is nearly forty years old, on the 7th. The old groom already has children and grandchildren, and his granddaughter was married last winter. Sun's son has also come of age.

Coal Prices Rise Without Decrease

At the end of last year, factories in the county experienced a shortage of coal due to scarce sources, causing prices to rise to 96 yuan per ton. This spring, land and water transportation have been restored, and goods from coal-producing areas are not obstructed. However, coal companies have few reserves, and factories are using coal at a high rate, so prices remain firm and are likely to continue to rise. Currently, Zhongxing coal is 15 yuan per ton, Datong coal is 13 yuan per ton, and Shanxi white coal is 45 yuan to 36 yuan per ton.

Investigating Business Capital

Previously, when the business tax bureau collected taxes from businesses in the county, they reduced the amount of original capital reported to the bureau to reduce the burden. Recently, when the central government collected income tax, the collection method required taxation based on the ratio of income to capital. Therefore, those with strong capital should also have generous profits. If the capital is relatively small but the profits are quite large, then the taxation is also heavy. As a result, the amount of capital declared by the various businesses to the income tax office was greater than the original sales capital in order to reduce taxation. However, this was the opposite of the reported business tax. When Dong Binqian, director of the business tax bureau, discovered this situation, he sent personnel to investigate the various businesses and required them to re-report the amount of capital for taxation.

### Ministry of Finance Telegraphed the Chamber of Commerce Explaining the Duty-Free Policy for Foreign Rice

From April to August, sales are limited to within Guangdong Province.

The Ministry of Finance, in response to a telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the duty-free import of foreign rice and grains into Guangdong, telegraphed a reply yesterday explaining the policy. The telegram stated: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: We have received your telegram. The people of Guangdong Province have always relied on foreign rice for their food supply. Last year's abundant harvest of domestic rice in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces could have been used to supply the deficit in Guangdong Province. However, since the food shortage in Guangdong Province began, although domestic rice has been continuously transported to Guangdong, the transportation organization has not been perfect, and the transfer of vehicles and ships has not been flexible, which has failed to fully provide relief. As a result, rice prices in Guangdong Province are still much higher than in previous years. Now that it is the season between harvests, the demand for rice in Guangdong Province is even greater than before, which concerns the local people's livelihood. Director Yu and the Guangdong Provincial Government have repeatedly pleaded on behalf of the people. After careful consideration, this Ministry, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, has decided on a method to alleviate the people's food shortage during the period between harvests in Guangdong Province. On the one hand, the Food Transportation and Sales Bureau, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, and the Guangdong Provincial Food Adjustment Committee should coordinate with each other to purchase surplus rice from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces and transport it to Guangdong. On the other hand, the quantity of foreign rice imported into Guangdong Province should be increased, and the customs duties should be temporarily waived to increase its import volume, thereby expanding the source of food for the people of Guangdong Province, so that the market price of rice can gradually stabilize due to the corresponding supply and demand and proper regulation. The duty-free policy for foreign rice and grains is stipulated to be implemented for five months, from April 1 to August 31, which is the period between harvests. The duty-free foreign rice is limited to 1.5 million metric tons, which is also a considerable restriction in quantity. The Guangdong Provincial Food Adjustment Committee should order the importers of this foreign rice to import it successively and on time to maintain a balance between the prices of foreign rice and domestic rice. Therefore, even if the sales of domestic rice in Guangdong are temporarily affected by commercial impulses, judging from the annual demand for rice supply in Guangdong Province, it should not hinder the sales of domestic rice. The original policy is hereby copied as follows: (1) Before the new rice harvest in Guangdong Province, during the period between harvests, in addition to the foreign rice that has already been transported in with a half-tax, an additional 2 million piculs of foreign rice and 2 million piculs of foreign grains will be allowed to be transported in completely duty-free. (2) The duty-free foreign rice and grains mentioned above will be supplied until the new rice harvest of this year. The starting and ending dates of its import and cessation will be determined by the Guangdong Provincial Government and reported to this Ministry for approval and instructions to the customs to implement. (3) When merchants purchase the above-mentioned foreign rice and grains for import into Guangdong Province, they should first guarantee the quantity and the customs of import, report it to the Guangdong Provincial Food Adjustment Committee for approval and registration, and the committee will coordinate the distribution. The quantity of rice and grains sold daily and the quantity of rice and grains in stock should also be reported to the Food Adjustment Committee for registration and verification. (4) The special approval for duty-free import of foreign rice and grains is for the purpose of adjusting the people's food supply and stabilizing market prices. All matters related to registration, management, and distribution should be handled by the Food Adjustment Committee, and personnel should be dispatched jointly with the Food Transportation and Sales Bureau and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to supervise strictly and prohibit hoarding so that the market price is always maintained at a certain standard. In case of unexpected changes, the Food Adjustment Committee should, together with the Food Transportation and Sales Bureau and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, find ways to stabilize it. (5) The foreign rice and grains imported from Guangdong Province can only be sold within Guangdong Province and are prohibited from being transported and sold elsewhere. The local military and political organs and customs shall jointly be responsible for this. In addition to this Ministry telegraphing Director Yu and the Provincial Government of Guangdong Province again, instructing the Food Adjustment Committee to properly distribute the supply and demand of rice and grains in accordance with the above-mentioned items (3) and (4), and to supervise strictly to ensure that rice prices are adjusted and stabilized, it is hoped that you will take note of this and inform representatives Gu Xin-yi, Chen Zi-yi, and others. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, seal."

### 163 Trade Associations Jointly Telegraphing, Requesting that Foreign Rice Tax Not Be Waived

Should Domestic Products Be Supported First? Heeding Public Opinion, Rescind the Order.

One hundred and sixty-three trade associations in this city, including the cotton cloth industry and silk industry, jointly telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, stating: "To President Chiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry: Ever since the case of duty-free foreign rice in Guangdong Province occurred, representatives from various provinces have argued strongly, public opinion has been in an uproar, and letters and telegrams have been flooding in. Without discussing whether there is a need to import a large amount of duty-free foreign rice in Guangdong Province at present, and whether domestic products should be supported first in mutual adjustment, as far as our industries in this city are concerned, in recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, all industries have declined, and the intrusion of foreign rice is a major factor. Since the autumn harvest was abundant last year, and the foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province was levied uniformly at the same time, according to the 'General Survey of Industry' compiled by the Ministry of Industry in 1936, the import of foreign rice in 1935 was 12,965,000 metric tons, which was sharply reduced to 3,103,000 metric tons in 1936. As a result, domestic rice sold well, and the rural economy gradually recovered. Shanghai's commerce also showed a prosperous scene. Unexpectedly, the budding vitality was nipped in the bud, the levee was breached again, the lush forest was withered again, and the future of commerce is still worth asking about. Your ministries have carefully considered the situation, are wise and insightful, and strive to take the lighter harm and choose the heavier benefit. Heeding public opinion and rescinding the order are deeply hoped for by all industries in Shanghai. We respectfully telegraph and appeal, hoping for your consideration. Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry, Paper Industry, Silk Industry, Sugar Industry, New Medicine Industry, Woolen Industry, Wood Industry, Pharmaceutical Factory Industry, and 163 other trade associations respectfully greet you."

Central News Agency reported: "The case of exempting foreign rice from tax in Guangdong has caused unease from all sides. Since the news spread, rice grains waiting to be transported to Guangdong in rice-producing regions have been halted midway. The price of Ke Xian rice has plummeted by two yuan in the past two weeks. Other rice grains have also been generally weak. Yesterday (the 8th) afternoon, when the City Chamber of Commerce held a meeting on current affairs, rice industry representatives Gu Xin-yi and Chen Zi-yi were specially present to explain the pros and cons of this matter. Although the City Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Finance explaining the reasons for exempting foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province, it believes that in the current situation, it is necessary to request a change. Therefore, it telegraphed again to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting that the measure of exempting foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province be stopped immediately for the sake of the rural economy and the interests of the rice industry. At the same time, the various trade associations in this city believe that the plummeting rice price not only affects farmers but also directly and indirectly affects other industries, so they jointly requested the central government to stop Guangdong Province from exempting foreign rice tax. Other provinces and cities, such as Jiangxi and Anhui provinces, as well as local people, have also telegraphed the central government in succession, making similar representations. The Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association of this city will submit a report on this matter at the regular meeting today (the 9th) and will prepare to go to Beijing for a third petition."

### Taxpayer Association Telegraphed to Strive for the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction

Hoping to achieve public opinion like the previous tariff negotiations

The Shanghai Municipal Council Taxpayer Association telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang yesterday, stating: "To the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government and Foreign Minister Wang: Regarding the letter approved from the Shanghai Bar Association, 'Upon investigation, the consular jurisdiction of various countries in China not only damages our national sovereignty and legal rights but also infringes upon the life and property of our nation, the harm of which is unparalleled. Over the years, people in our country have been running around and appealing, advocating for its abolition, but to no avail, and it remains the same to this day. Now that our country has been unified and is advancing towards national rejuvenation, if the consular jurisdiction is allowed to continue to exist, it will be an obstacle to the national rejuvenation. Upon the proposal of member Lu Dingkui, this association submitted a request to the Executive Yuan of the National Government to send a letter to all countries with existing consular jurisdiction, stating the reasons and setting a deadline for abolition. If no agreement is reached after the deadline, it should declare its abolition. This matter concerns striving for the liberation of the entire nation, and the submitted draft is enclosed for your review.' Upon investigation, regarding this case, on December 14, 1929, June 27, July 10, and November 28, this association telegraphed you repeatedly, requesting implementation. Several years have passed without achieving the goal, which is very heartbreaking. You, Minister Wang, are a leading authority in world law and are well-versed in international politics. Obtaining the abolition of foreign consular jurisdiction in China is undoubtedly like the previous tariff negotiations by Minister Wang, which received the sympathy of the whole country. In accordance with the preceding letter, in addition to replying, we have enclosed the above-mentioned telegram for your consideration and look forward to your response. Chairman Zhu Xiaolai and Yuan Ludeng greet you."

### The Ningjing Ship Employees' Strike Was Resolved

Work Resumed on the Same Day

The Ningjing shipping line strike caused by the Ningjing ship salary reduction was resolved yesterday morning at 9 a.m., by Director of Maritime Affairs Wu Yu and Yang Hu of the Seamen's Party Department, who convened representatives from both labor and management to hold a mediation meeting at the Maritime Affairs Bureau. Five labor representatives, including Lu Yinshi, Zhang Yongshun, and Ma Dianyuan, and two management representatives, Lu Yuyang and Ji Yunfu, were present. The mediators were Director of Maritime Affairs Wu Yu, Hu Hanwu, the head of the assessment section of the bureau, Yang Hu of the Seamen's Party Department, Feng Yuming and Jiang Yanjun on behalf of the (Hu Wei), chief engineer, Yang Linyi on behalf of the steering association, and Zhao Bujing on behalf of the Seamen's Union. From 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., the two parties engaged in negotiations for five hours. The labor side put forward seven conditions, and as a result, the mediators made a ruling, and the conditions were fully resolved at 2 p.m. The conditions were as follows, and the mediation result was decided as follows: 1. The salary shall be restored to the original salary standard from February 20, the number of sailors and the food allowance shall be restored in accordance with the company's previous method, and at the same time, restored. 2. Crew members shall not be dismissed without reason in the future. 3. In the future, there shall be no lowering of wages or transfer of employees under the pretext of rental. 4. All treatment of crew members shall be handled in accordance with maritime law. 5. If the company's business develops, the salary of crew members may be increased appropriately. 6. All expenses of this dispute shall be borne by the company. 7. All crew members of the Ningjing wheel shall resume work. At that time, the representatives of both parties were satisfied and left happily. The Ningjing ship immediately resumed work and unloaded goods, and fired cannons on the ship to celebrate to show victory. The crew members were especially grateful for the mediation by Feng Yuming and others, and obtained this satisfactory harvest.

Central News Agency reported: "On February 19, Ningshao Commercial Shipping Company leased the hull of its ship Ningjing to Shenchang Company for a long period. According to shipping practice, all crew salaries and ship expenses for a long-term hull lease are the responsibility of the charterer. In order to take care of the crew's livelihood, Ningshao Company specially introduced all of its original crew members to Shenchang Company for continued employment. Shenchang, because the freight rate was not strong at that time, therefore revised the salary standard, but the crew members did not understand the nature of the hull lease and mistakenly believed that the ship belonged to Ningshao and should not deduct wages, so they went on strike to Ningshao to request restoration of the original salary and submitted it to the Seamen's Special Party Department, the Maritime Affairs Bureau, the Shipping Joint Association, and the Drivers' Association for assistance. When the Seamen's Special Party Department and the Maritime Affairs Bureau determined the truth, it was a matter for both labor and management and had nothing to do with Ningshao Company, so it convened representatives of the Ningjing lessee and crew members to mediate. Yesterday (the 8th), representatives of Ningjing crew members Lu Yinshi and Zhang Yongshun and Shenchang Company representative Li Yunfu: The Seamen's Party Department, the Seamen's Union, the China Shipping Association, and the China Merchant Marine Drivers' Association all had representatives present, and the director of the Maritime Affairs Bureau, Wu Yu, personally presided over the meeting, explained the misunderstanding, and proposed five mediation methods, which were accepted as satisfactory by both the lessee and the labor side. This month-long strike was resolved."

### Workers at the New Yu Second Factory Went on Strike Yesterday Morning

Party and Government Agencies Dispatched Personnel Yesterday to Investigate in Detail, Section Chief Liu of the Ministry of Industry Will Return to Beijing

After the workers of the New Yu Yarn Factory, operated by Chengfu Company, resumed work on the morning of the 6th after mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs, the First Factory went on strike again the night before. The Second Factory was also affected yesterday morning. Party and government agencies are conducting thorough investigations. Details are as follows:

The First and Second Factories Went on Strike Again

After the workers of the New Yu West Suzhou Road First Factory and the Roberts Road Second Factory resumed work, the Bureau of Social Affairs gathered and mediated on the morning before yesterday, and 56 workers were dismissed, and some were fruitless, so the workers of the first factory went on strike again at 6 p.m. the night before. The second factory was also affected yesterday morning at 6 a.m. The total number of workers in the two factories is about 3,000. After receiving the report, the local constabulary immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to protect the factory.

### Deliberating the Case of Increased Donation, The Chinese Directors of the Municipal Council Unanimously Refused to Attend the Last Meeting of the Board of Directors

Expressing a Consistent and Firm Opposition to Increasing the General Donation, The Decision Was Made to Submit a Report on the Process to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association

New New News Agency reported: "The Shanghai Municipal Council's Board of Directors, this time ignoring the opinions of the Chinese directors, passed the increase in the municipal general donation by a difference of one vote, from 14 percent to 16 percent, and the land tax from 7 per thousand to 8 per thousand, which aroused strong opposition from all citizens, and the public sentiment was indignant, and they made solemn expressions. If the bureau ignores public opinion, acts wilfully, and forcibly increases the donation, then a serious dispute is on the rise. Municipal Council Chairman Arnold has not yet replied to the letters from the Citizens' United Association of the First Special District and other groups requesting reconsideration and revocation of the increased donation. Therefore, the last meeting of the Board of Directors of this session was convened the day before yesterday to deliberate on the increase in the general donation case passed by the previous special Board of Directors meeting, and the report to the Foreign Ratepayers' Association. At that time, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and other five Chinese directors, representing more than 64 percent of the tax assessment in the district and more than 95 percent of the population, unanimously refused to attend to show their consistent and firm opposition. According to reporters from the New New News Agency, the five Chinese directors exchanged views on this issue at the Chinese Ratepayers' Association on the afternoon before yesterday, and continued to discuss countermeasures at the Bank Club at 12 noon yesterday, and decided to submit the process of increasing the donation by two percent to the first representative meeting of the 16th session of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association on the 12th. The power to make the final decision in this case rests with the taxpayers. Although it has been passed by the Board of Directors, it has no right to bind the taxpayers. Therefore, it is specially submitted to the Foreign Ratepayers' Association for reconsideration. It is still difficult to predict whether the association can accept the citizens' request and veto it. The most regrettable thing is that the Chinese Ratepayers' Association has not been able to be on an equal footing with the Foreign Ratepayers' Association. All Municipal Council budget proposals do not need to be submitted to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association for approval. They can take effect after being passed by the Foreign Ratepayers' Association. This kind of deformed organization is the most unequal, and it is hoped that citizens will strive for it to protect their due rights."

The Shanghai Times reported: "When the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council held its last meeting on Wednesday afternoon, the five Chinese directors did not attend due to their dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council's increase in the municipal donation, in order to express their opposition, but the legal quorum was still met, and the meeting was opened. The meeting that day was dedicated to ending the affairs of the Board of Directors of this session. One of the main events on the agenda was to consider the speech that General Chairman Arnold planned to deliver at the annual meeting. The speech will generally discuss the municipal administration handled by the Board of Directors in the past year. Judging from the current situation, the Foreign Taxpayer Annual Meeting next Wednesday will only be a formal meeting, because no special resolutions have been proposed for those with voting rights to consider. As for the move to increase the municipal donation, although the Chinese people strongly oppose it, it is unlikely to encounter formal opposition at the annual meeting."

### Xinghua Paper Mill Labor Unrest Resolved

Yang Along and Shen Rongkui, representatives of the Fifth District Paper Industry Union, and Zhou Dagang and Chen Qichang, representatives of Xinghua Paper Mill, were present. The mediation was chaired by Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Third Division, and Jiang Shifu recorded the minutes. On the spot, both parties agreed and signed a settlement record: (1) Workers should be fully hired after Xinghua takes over Changji; (2) Half of the wages will be paid during the strike period; (3) Xinghua will give 105 long-term workers a subsidy of a certain amount per person; (4) Workers will resume work on the same day; (5) New conditions will be mediated according to law after review.

### Yesterday Morning Resumption of Work

Settled Through Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau

Dagong News reported that over three hundred workers from the Shanghai West Kang Nao Tuo Road China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory went on strike together on the 31st of last month because they opposed the factory's unwarranted dismissal of workers Li Du and Duan Youchun.

The headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society in Shanghai hosted a luncheon at 12 PM yesterday for hundreds of members attending the fourth annual meeting of the Chinese Medical Association at the recently opened Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge. Pang Jingzhou, Secretary-General of the Red Cross, presided over the Western-style meal and delivered a welcoming speech, stating, "Ladies and gentlemen, today I am honored to be ordered by Chairman Wang Ruchang to represent the Chinese Red Cross Society in hosting you. I am very pleased. However, I do not offer this modest meal and wine merely as a gesture of emotional connection, but also to merge the spirit of the Red Cross with the spirit of our colleagues in the medical field into one. This Chinese Medical Congress is unprecedented in its scale, which is sufficient to show the daily progress of our country's medical affairs. However, upon careful consideration, we are still far from our hopes. To take a small matter as an example, I was a guest at the dinner of this association and gave a reply speech on behalf of the Chinese Medical Association. Today, I am the host and give a respectful speech to you. Isn't it necessary for one person to兼 任 both roles, which shows the lack of talent in our medical field? Gentlemen, some of you are practicing medicine, some are teaching, and some are兼 任 科, and some are in charge of clinical and experimental work, especially in the inland areas where internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics, and pediatrics are all handled by one person, which is the same reason. Therefore, in Director Liu's speech the other day, the so-called responsibility of us is very complicated. Director Liu also mentioned that doctors have the obligation to assist the Red Cross. I will reiterate this statement today. As for the importance of the Red Cross, I believe you must have known it long ago, so I will not repeat it. However, in today's world situation, the responsibility of our Chinese Red Cross will be even more serious, which is very clear. Unfortunately, since the founding of the Chinese Red Cross 34 years ago, although it has laid many foundations for the new medical history of our country, such as establishing medical schools, in recent years, it has rarely been cared for by the medical community, which is regrettable. However, the Red Cross is always inextricably linked to the medical community. For example, the public medical system and rural hygiene issues discussed at this Chinese Medical Association meeting were once the cooperation between the Red Cross and the medical community, and were already stipulated in a certain resolution of the World Red Cross Congress. However, among the members of the Chinese Red Cross, there are only hundreds of doctors, compared with the 8,831 doctors statistically counted by the Department of Health (as of the end of March this year), which is less than 5%. This kind of畸形 phenomenon may not exist in other countries in the world, so I hope that you will persuade others to join the Red Cross to correct this畸形. Secondly, I hope that foreign comrades will assist the Red Cross with their medical and academic knowledge under the professional principles of charity without borders, and be able to serve us in China's extraordinary period, which is especially gratifying. Finally, I have a report to our military medical colleagues, that is, in the future, the Red Cross's ambulance organization and training, as well as the use of medicines and other tools, will use the various regulations and publications of the Military Medical Department, so that its standards are consistent with the military doctors, so as to avoid the regret that military doctors and the Red Cross could not fully cooperate in the past. When Director Liu and I gave a speech in Suiyuan the other day, I repeatedly paid tribute to the military doctors in the north. Recently, in view of the needs of the times, the central government promulgated the Outline of Ambulance Work in Extraordinary Areas, which takes the Red Cross as the main body, and the previously promulgated Red Cross Management Regulations also stipulate that wartime ambulance must be initiated by the Red Cross. However, unfortunately, it is still heard that some people point out the ability of the Red Cross and are unwilling to be in a passive position and devote themselves to ambulance work, so they all take themselves as the initiative and work separately, so that the ambulance cause and strength tend to be scattered, and the result is really unfavorable to the country. It is necessary to know that there are three kinds of passive, the best is to be in a passive position, but can adjust the original moving mechanism, so that the action is more effective and harmonious, secondly, it is passive but unwilling to easily change its track, and the worst is passive and may lead to mistakes. I think that our medical community has many talents, and all organizations are waiting for us to adjust, and its mechanism is passive, why is it hurt? Therefore, I hope that you will not follow the national habit of" yelling loudly outside the door", quickly enter the Red Cross, and then criticize as much as possible, regardless of the branch or the general association, and correct the errors frankly, and especially hope that you will督责 me personally, then the future of the Red Cross is hopeful. The other day someone said that the Zhongshan Hospital and the Shanghai Medical College, and the Municipal Hospital and Tongji University, are like a marriage between two sexes, which will produce a 寧馨 child for the medical cause. Now I especially hope that the Red Cross will use the Chinese Medical Association as a medium and marry the national medical community to produce the only ambulance organization in the new China." The words were earnest and touched the hearts of the listeners. At that time, many people filled in volunteer forms to join the association as members. Subsequently, doctors Li Tao, Hu Mei, Maya Gu, Otto, Yan Fuqing, and Director of the Health Bureau Li Tingan gave speeches, generally congratulating the Red Cross on its boundless progress and benefiting the people of the world, and dispersed until about 2 PM.

### Social Affairs Bureau Orders Reinstatement in the Fu'an Company Dismissal Case

The Capital Side Refuses to Accept

Fu'an Import and Export Company at No. 209 Broadway employed more than 100 workers. In January, the capital side unreasonably dismissed eight members of the executive committee of the Fourth District Import and Export Industry Union, Wu Yaoyuan, Du Mingji, and Xu Wei, because they were dissatisfied with their participation in the授綏一日 movement. The union petitioned party and government organs, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions sent personnel to mediate. After investigating the facts, it was deemed that the capital side was unreasonable. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued a batch order 市字第5838号 the other day, stating, "Receipt acknowledged. The company has been ordered to promptly allow Wu Yaoyuan and others to resume work on a designated date. Please note this approval." It was recently heard that Fu'an Company refused to accept the Social Affairs Bureau's order to reinstate them. Miao Yuchun and others, the standing directors of the union, repeatedly negotiated with the company, but there was still no result. The labor side has now decided to request further assistance from the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Reports on the Situation of the Henan Disaster by Investigators of the Sino-Foreign Relief Committee

The Sino-Foreign Relief Committee at No. 50 Renji Road, in conjunction with the Chinese Jisheng Society, dispatched special personnel to Henan Province to prepare for relief work. Yesterday, it was heard that the committee had received reports from investigators Yu Jiashen, Mikeinson, and Zheng Shouchang on the drought situation in Dengfeng County. The report is recorded as follows: "Dengfeng County is surrounded by mountains, with steep terrain, and both rivers and wells are scarce, making irrigation difficult. Since last autumn, there has been no rain for a long time, and all crops have withered, with no harvest. The county is divided into three districts, about 150 to 160 li from east to west and about 70 to 80 li from north to south, with a total population of 240,000, of which more than 100,000 are affected, and more than 60,000 are unable to survive without relief. Currently, the general victims are grinding tree bark into flour to fill their hunger, all with a 鹄面鸠形. What we saw along the way was begging and crying, which we couldn't bear to see. The investigation will be carried out tomorrow to save the victims as soon as possible." The committee believes that the disaster in Henan Province is deep and wide, and there are many victims. They hope that all sectors will provide as much assistance as possible to solve the crisis as soon as possible.

### Dr. Ribot Sues the Municipal Council for Illegal Elections

Eliminating Unlawful Actions in the Past; Correcting Years of Errors by the French Municipal Council

The English-language 大美 Evening News reported that Dr. Ribot, a French physician residing in the French Concession, hired a solicitor from the Da Merchant Firm as his representative and sued the chairman of the French Municipal Council, the French Consul-General, for the election of the Land Committee to the Chairman of the French Court of the French Consulate, Judge Kauffmann. The trial opened this morning (the 8th). Dr. Ribot stated the reasons for the lawsuit, saying that his note was to show the irregularities in the election of the Land Committee by the French Municipal Council since 1927, requesting a new election and canceling the election held on March 4 this year. Dr. Ribot also asked the court to pay attention to the rules of election of the French Municipal Council, and the election held in the last ten years has directly violated this rule. According to the election rules, the names of the two candidates for the Land Committee must be announced one week before the election, but the French Municipal Council did not follow this rule. This year, the names were announced on March 2 and the election was held on the 4th, and March 2 was the deadline for submitting candidates, only 24 hours from the election. He had sent a letter to the illegal Municipal Council on March 2 requesting himself as a candidate and was accepted by the Council, so the number of candidates increased from two to three. The election should have been held, but one of the candidates withdrew on his own, so there was still no election. However, he initially thought that he had gone through this procedure, because he received a letter from the French Municipal Council, saying that he had been elected as a member of the Land Committee. He has no objection to the remuneration fee given to the Land Committee. What he opposes is the method of election of the Land Committee. His lawsuit this time is to eliminate this kind of unlawful action since the establishment of the Provisional Committee on January 14, 1927, (according to the head of the Provisional Committee, the members of the Municipal Council are all appointed by the French Consul-General every year,) and one is not to make people think that he has obtained the position of committee member and takes the remuneration, and then keeps silent. After Dr. Ribot made his confession, the solicitor from the Da Merchant Firm spoke in court. According to the report, Dr. Ribot had met with the French Consul-General before filing the lawsuit, refused to accept the position of a member who was not really elected, and asked to cancel the election. The French Consul-General refused, so he resorted to law to correct the years of errors of the French Municipal Council.

### Insulin Therapy for Mental Illness

At the academic discussion of the fourth conference of the Chinese Medical Association yesterday (8th), a paper from the Department of Psychiatry of the Shanghai Medical College was presented and read by Dr. Han Fen, the head of the department, describing the latest and astonishing invention in the treatment of mental illness, which is truly good news for general sufferers of mental illness. Schizophrenia, also known as dementia praecox, is the most common of all mental illnesses, but there has been no effective treatment for it in the past, and it is recognized as an incurable disease. A few years ago, Dr. Sakel of the University of Vienna invented the use of insulin to cause a coma in patients with this disease, and after the patients wake up, they undergo a great change in their mental state. In this way, one injection is given daily, each lasting several hours, for several weeks to two or three months. Depending on how early or late the patient contracted the disease, there is hope for the patient's mental state to return to normal. Since then, it has been used in the University Hospital of Vienna, and many people have been cured. Since then, it has been used in several major hospitals in Europe and the United States, and has also been effective. It is heard that the Department of Psychiatry of the Shanghai Medical College Practice Hospital has also adopted this therapy since Dr. Han Fen, the head of the department, returned to Austria last autumn. This is the first time in China. This is truly an important contribution to recent science to have the opportunity to cure an incurable and very common mental illness.

Registration will be closed early when the quota is full.

### Bankruptcy Meeting of the Zhonghua Jiande Association to be Held

The Shanghai Local Court has accepted the bankruptcy case of the Zhonghua Jiande Association, and a meeting of creditors was once convened last year.

### The Yandui Industry Public Council Resolves on Methods for Exchanging Copper Coins

Report to the Association First for the Need of Subsidiary Coins; Reduce the Amount in Case of Insufficiency

The Shanghai South Office of the Municipal Yandui Industry Association notified its members yesterday, stating, "To whom it may concern, in accordance with the central government's exchange of one-cent new copper subsidiary coins, the amount is not enough recently, resulting in a reduction in exchange, which is inevitable to cause controversy. For this reason, it has been re-negotiated. In the future, all members who need one-cent new copper subsidiary coins must first report to the association and submit one letter of credit (信洋) to the association for verification of the total amount in order to report to the public council to notify the Central Bank, and the time will be sent to the meeting. If there is a shortage of the time, the amount will only be reduced in order to show the average and avoid controversy. Please note accordingly."

### Electrical Store Owner Accused of False Accusation Trial Concluded

Verdict to be Announced on the Thirteenth

Wu Wushi, a Ningbo native and owner of Ruixiang Electrical Store at No. 455 Donghanbili Road, reported to the Jiaxing Road police station at 4:40 PM on the 31st of last month that Wang Zhenhua, an apprentice from Suzhou hired by his store, had embezzled electrical materials worth 43.4 yuan and secretly spent the money. After investigation by Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station, the accusation was found to be untrue. Wu was summoned to the First Special Court and prosecuted for false accusation. Under questioning by Judge Chuan Lin, both parties presented their own versions of events. Wu Wushi was released on bail with a 500 yuan guarantee. The store's acting partner, Shen Jinkui, was instructed to work with police detectives to check the accounts and determine if any electrical materials were missing and if the reported amount matched. The case was adjourned for further verification. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo of the Fifth Criminal Court continued the hearing. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, stated that the investigation revealed discrepancies between the missing electrical materials and the defendant's claim. He submitted an inventory list for review. Subsequently, a detective and store partner Shen Jinkui gave their statements. The defendant insisted that Wang Zhenhua had indeed embezzled funds and was not falsely accused. He stated that Wang's monthly salary was three yuan, and after deducting expenses, he sent the money home. He claimed to have seen six yuan in Wang's wallet and when questioned about the source, Wang was evasive. Wang Zhenhua stated that he had four yuan and thirty cents in his wallet, of which three yuan was sent by his sister-in-law for personal expenses, as the thin porridge served in the store was not filling enough, and he used it to buy snacks. He denied embezzling any electrical material funds. The defendant's lawyer, Wu Linkun, argued that Wang Zhenhua's claim that his sister-in-law sent him three yuan was false. He presented a letter from Wang's sister-in-law dated the 21st of last month, detailing difficulties in redeeming pawned items due to expiring housing loans. Therefore, Wang used embezzlement to secretly sell various electrical materials, not writing them in the accounts, and pocketing the money. Furthermore, he was found with a large bunch of keys, two of which matched the electrical material cabinet door keys held by the store owner Wu Wushi, allowing him to open it at any time. Therefore, the charge of false accusation is untenable and should be dismissed. He requested that the court review the letter from Wang Zhenhua's sister-in-law. Judge Dai allowed Wu Wushi to remain on his original bail and scheduled the verdict for the 13th of this month.

### Small Shop in Yangjing South, Pudong, Repeatedly Robbed

He and his wife work hard and frugally without hiring any employees and have managed to save a little money. They have been robbed multiple times before. On the night of the 24th of last month, five or six robbers, armed with pistols, axes, iron rulers, and other weapons, broke into the shop. They first tied up and beat the shop owner and his wife with hemp ropes, demanding to know where they had hidden their money. They were covered in bruises and bleeding. On the 26th, more bandits broke in and looted the shop, taking even rice, cigarettes, and preserved eggs. The two robberies resulted in losses of over 300 yuan. The victim is extremely distressed by the repeated robberies and serious injuries. He has filed a loss report with the local police station, requesting a thorough investigation and arrest of the perpetrators. However, more than ten days have passed, and there are no leads.

The French police arrested Yan, Gu, and Xue and brought them to the Second Special Court for trial. Yan was sentenced to three years and two months in prison and fined 100 yuan. Gu was sentenced to ten months in prison, and Xue was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison. The family of the deceased filed an additional civil lawsuit for 12,350 yuan.

The court stated that without the witness, the trial could not proceed and adjourned the case until April 15th. Yan and Xue, the two defendants, were returned to the detention center.

### News of the Launch of the Changshu Shanghai Youth Association

Yang Yuzhen, Zeng Qin Shen, Lu Wei Xun, Zhang Zhengzong, Chen Yizu, Lu Ge, Gu Zonghua, Yang Dingyi, Shen Tongwu Yin Shaozeng, Zhang Zemin, Zhang Jiasheng, Zhang Yaoxi, Zhang Yaodong, Tong Qingzhen and other outstanding youths from Changshu in Shanghai have launched the Changshu Shanghai Youth Association. They did so because they recognized the danger of China's current situation, which has reached a critical point. The ancients said, "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual." To turn danger into safety and weakness into strength, we rely on whether our youth can strive for progress and bury themselves in hard work, and whether they can cooperate with people in society and walk hand in hand. Shanghai has a large population, with people from all directions, and is watched by the world. However, the youth here have grown accustomed to a decadent lifestyle in this luxurious city, which is the main reason for our country's current weakness. This big problem is most prevalent among our fellow townsmen, so we launched the "Changshu Shanghai Youth Association". There are three goals for its organization: First, to strengthen physical fitness and eliminate decadent lifestyles so that every young person has ample energy. Second, to abandon individual liberalism and cultivate a life of group mutual assistance, so that the entire nation strengthens its spirit of unity. Third, to cultivate a spirit of order, discipline, and organization, to lay the foundation for the revitalization of the nation. Under these necessary regulations, we will make plans for ten years of training and ten years of growth. Then the strength of the entire nation will not be difficult to turn from danger to safety and from weakness to strength. Although a cup of water cannot put out a cartload of burning firewood and a drop in the bucket doesn't help much, if one person advocates it, a hundred people will follow; if one region tries it, the whole country will follow suit. Then the results obtained will certainly be impressive. It is reported that the association is currently actively pursuing all matters. All affairs are temporarily handled by Mr. Yang Yuzhen (mailing address: Pudong Electric Company, Zhangjiabang, Pudong, Shanghai).

### Annual Meeting of the China Leprosy Relief Association Held Yesterday

The China Leprosy Relief Association held its third annual meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglinqiao. Attendees included Mao Yun, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Liu Ruiheng, Director of the National Health Administration of the Ministry of Interior, Li Ting'an, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, Qiao Teng, Director of the Health Department of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, Yan Fuqing, President of the National Medical College, representatives from local branches, members, guests, and others, totaling more than 200 people. In the afternoon, proposals were discussed, officers were elected, and the Dachang Leprosy Hospital was visited. Details are as follows:

Chairman's Report After the meeting began, Chairman Yan Fuqing reported on the significance of this year's meeting, stating that the association had recently partnered with the Chinese Medical Association to research and implement connected strategies. He explained that the Leprosy Relief Association is a charitable relief organization, while the Chinese Medical Association is a research and treatment group. Statistics show that leprosy patients are prevalent in more than 600 counties across the country, with over one million patients. Although leprosy clinics have been established in various locations across the country, they are mostly private organizations and limited by financial resources and personnel, making it impossible to accommodate all patients. He expressed hope that the government would establish large-scale leprosy hospitals to benefit patients. He also mentioned that there had recently been instances of killing leprosy patients in Guangdong, with hundreds of people being victimized. He condemned this as inhumane and hoped that the members would discuss and demand that the authorities punish the perpetrators.

Speeches from Party and Government Officials Then, Li Ting'an, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, representing the Director of the National Health Administration, gave a speech stating that there are over one million leprosy patients in China, most of whom are poor. He hoped that the association would work hard to provide relief before the government could step in. He stated that the government was not ignoring the issue, but that China's health infrastructure was inadequate, and there were many matters requiring construction across the country. Furthermore, it was limited by finances, so it could not be addressed immediately.

### Hotel Guest Trafficking Drugs

Detectives Received Information and Went to Arrest - Hotel Owner Tipped Off and Let Them Escape

The Lao Zha Police Station, because the area near Avenue Edward VII and Guangxi Road within its jurisdiction has almost become a gathering place for Korean vagrants colluding with Chinese people to sell drugs, dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct strict investigations in the area. They cracked more than ten drug trafficking cases every day, all of which were sent to the First Special Court for severe punishment. At 12:50 AM on the 2nd of this month, Lu Dagong, a Chinese detective of the police station, learned that someone was selling heroin and other drugs in the Sentai Inn at No. 24 Jingyuan Street for people to consume. He then led Chinese detective Ding Yizhong to arrest the suspect. The owner of the inn, Wang Kunrong from Pudong, turned on the lights as a prearranged signal to warn the drug addicts to escape. Fortunately, Detective Lu was quick and managed to arrest three drug offenders, who were sent to the First Special Court for investigation. The police station believes that Wang Kunrong not only provided a venue for people to consume drugs, but also dared to tip them off when law enforcement officers were investigating and arresting them. This is a blatant disregard for the law. Therefore, Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Legal Department of the Engineering Bureau, filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court under Article 5 of the Anti-Drug Regulations for providing a venue for people to consume drugs (punishable by death). Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Court heard the case. After Lawyer Wang presented the facts of the indictment, Detective Lu testified about the events that occurred. Wang Kunrong denied providing a venue for people to consume drugs and tipping them off. After the court appointed a lawyer to defend him, Judge Feng announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for a later date.

### Health Bureau Technician Gu Zhaoqi Accused

The Bureau Discovered Embezzlement - The Court Filed a Public Prosecution for Dereliction of Duty

Gu Zhaoqi, a technician at the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and a graduate of National Central University, was assigned to the bureau to inspect cattle slaughtering. Recently, the bureau discovered that Gu had engaged in embezzlement and sent him to the local court for investigation. After clarifying the facts, a public prosecution was filed for dereliction of duty. Yesterday afternoon, Court President Cai Dingcheng opened the court to hear the case. The defendant, Gu Zhaoqi, testified that he was 29 years old, from Wuxi, and had been working as an inspection technician at the Health Bureau for several years. When asked about the procedures, he replied that butchers first applied to the Finance Bureau for slaughtering permits and then inspected them at the specified time. However, the tax collectors from the Finance Bureau would tear off a corner of the permits first, and he would inspect the cattle based on the torn permits. When asked about the discrepancy of 25 head between the slaughtering account books in Changxing from September 1933 to the end of 1935 and his report, he replied that he had no right to inspect their account books. When asked why his report sometimes did not match the number in the butcher's account book, he replied that cattle slaughtered in Nanshi, Zhabei, and the Public Concession could be sold, but those slaughtered in the French Concession had to be slaughtered within the French Concession. They recorded the number slaughtered in the French Concession together, causing the discrepancy. When asked why their account books recorded the number of cattle slaughtered on October 4, Animal Day, and New Year's Day, when cattle slaughtering was suspended, he replied that the Health Bureau had issued an order to suspend slaughtering, but if they slaughtered, it was illegal slaughtering. Then, the witness Hu Zhensou, 41 years old, from Shanghai, a tax collector at the Finance Bureau, testified that he went to the slaughterhouse to collect permits. He tore off a corner of the permit for each cattle slaughtered and gave it to the Health Bureau technician for inspection. When asked if the number of permits he collected, the number of cattle, the number recorded in the account book, and the number inspected matched, he replied that they were the same. When asked why the Health Bureau sent someone to investigate and found 25 fewer cattle from April 1933 to the end of 1935, he replied that the inspection at the time was correct. When asked if the number recorded in the Changxing slaughterhouse's account book was sometimes more and sometimes less than the number reported to the Health Bureau, he replied that he did not know. He only saw the cattle, tore off the corner of the permit, and gave it to the technician for inspection, which was always correct. When asked if he could inspect alone, he replied that he could not. As for the amount in the account books, they also wrote the cattle slaughtered in the French Concession in the account, causing the discrepancy. The witness also questioned the owner of the cattle farm, Fei Shaojin, Wu Xichou, etc. After a debate by Lawyer Jia Yaoxi on behalf, the official ordered a thorough investigation of the slaughtering to verify the facts.

### Hua Mei Evening News Zhu Zuotong and Others Accused

Disputes Arising from Investment in Shares - Zhang Xiuzhe Files Criminal Charges of Embezzlement

Zhu Zuotong, general manager of the Hua Mei Evening News on Avenue Edward VII, and Wu Bannong, director of the general management office, were recently criminally charged with embezzlement by Zhang Xiuzhe, a Fujianese residing at No. 44 Anlefang on Jing'an Temple Road, who hired a lawyer to file the charges with the First Special Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the Ninth Criminal Court to hear the case. The defendant Wu Bannong could not attend because his wife had passed away and he had returned to his hometown. Only Zhu Zuotong's defense lawyer was present in court. The plaintiff, Zhang Xiuzhe, stated that he had studied in Japan and after returning to Shanghai last year, he was introduced to Zhu Zuotong, general manager of the Hua Mei Evening News, by Wu Hanqi, the younger brother of his friend Wu Bannong. Wu Hanqi praised the Hua Mei Evening News for its thriving business and invited him to invest in it. At the time, he was unemployed and had been a longtime friend of the Wu brothers, so he invested 2,500 yuan as a deposit in the newspaper, with a receipt from Hua Mei attached with conditions. Later, because the conditions were not met, he demanded the return of the deposit, but he was repeatedly evaded. To date, only 500 yuan has been returned, and the remaining 2,000 yuan has not been settled. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit. Zhu Zuotong testified that the plaintiff was indeed introduced by Wu Hanqi and was willing to invest 2,500 yuan in the newspaper, with 500 yuan as share capital and 2,000 yuan as a loan, with a written agreement. The plaintiff also served as the director of the translation department of the newspaper from February 2nd of this year. However, because the plaintiff's conditions were too harsh and his salary expectations were too high, the matter did not go well. The plaintiff resigned on February 25th and sent him a letter demanding the return of the money. He had repeatedly contacted him and had successively returned 600 yuan and was willing to give the plaintiff all the advertising revenue for April as collateral for the remaining balance. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff abruptly filed a lawsuit. He stated that the case was of a civil nature and was not his personal matter, and the plaintiff should not have filed a criminal lawsuit. Judge Zhan ruled that the case would be adjourned to the 13th for further hearing because the defendant Wu Bannong had not arrived.

### Poor Man Produces Triplets

Zhongshan Hospital Sends People to Adopt

Guo Dexin, a 38-year-old man from Qingyuan, Guangdong, lives in the kitchen of No. 78 Anshunli, Kangti Road, French Concession. He used to work as a bookkeeper at the Zu'an Socks Factory on Dongyouheng Road, but lost his job when the factory closed. He married Li Ruiyun, a 31-year-old woman from the same hometown. After being pregnant for ten months, she gave birth to triplets at 9:30 PM the night before. The three boys are lively and lovely, causing a sensation far and wide, and considered a remarkable tale. After learning about the case, Zhongshan Hospital, fearing that Guo would be unable to raise the three children, sent its female doctor to contact him about adoption.

### Wei Guangling Sued for Usury

Monthly Interest of One and a Half Percent, Further Deducted for Handling Fees - Mother and Son Generate Interest Higher Than Rolling Loan Interest

--Wei Sues the Guarantor for Unpaid Balance--

Xu Peikun and Zhu Muzhou, editor of the Commercial Press, are both friends with Wang Naigang. Wang needed funds for business purposes and borrowed 2,000 yuan from Wei Guangling on December 1, 1934, at Gu Xianzhang Law Office. Xu and Zhu acted as guarantors. The terms of the loan were very harsh. The main points were that the loan should be repaid in three months, and if it could not be repaid on time, it could be extended for another three months. Each subsequent extension would be subject to the same conditions. The interest rate was agreed to be one and a half percent per month. When paying the loan, interest for the first three months would be deducted in advance, and a handling fee of 9.5 yuan per 100 yuan would be deducted. Therefore, on the day the loan was made, handling fees of 190 yuan and interest of 93 yuan were deducted, and Wang received only 1,717 yuan. Subsequently, each extension required handling fees and interest to be calculated on the basis of the 2,000 yuan borrowed.

Borrowed Amount Deducted in Advance

By the end of November of the following year, when the fourth extension expired, Wang had repaid 800 yuan of the principal. From then on, the handling fee for each extension was calculated on the basis of 1,200 yuan and a deduction of 114 yuan was made. The interest deducted was 65.5 yuan. In August of last year, after the sixth extension expired, because Wang had neither repaid the loan nor gone through the extension procedures, the creditor applied to the court for mediation. As a result, Wang continued to repay 400 yuan, and

Repaid the Creditor

Wang also paid 100 yuan of lawyer fees to Gu Xianzhang, a mediator. For the seventh period, the handling fees for each extension was calculated at 800 yuan, with 76 yuan deducted, and the pre-deducted interest amounted to 37.2 yuan. From the establishment of the loan until recently, the total amount of handling fees and interest deducted amounted to 1,897.5 yuan. Wang Naigang had repaid the principal twice, totaling 1,200 yuan, and the exorbitant interest generated was such that

The Interest on the Principal Was High

Even rolling loan interest, mother and son money, might not be as big. Now, Wei Guangling sued Xu Peikun and Zhu Muzhou, the guarantors, to the First Special District Court through Lawyer Gu Xianzhang, claiming that the debtor's balance of 800 yuan was overdue, and he had neither repaid nor extended it according to the usual practice, seeking to

Recover the Principal and Interest

and demand compensation for the 250 yuan breach of contract. Yesterday, Judge Jia summoned Wang Naigang and also extended Lawyer Huang Xiubo to attend the litigation, stating the loan and the number of extensions. Xu Peili's lawyer, Xi Shichang, argued that the plaintiff's repeated income exceeded the principal, and the defendant, although a guarantor, did not need to bear the liability for compensation. After mutual arguments with the plaintiff's lawyer, the court ordered a further investigation.

### Yesterday, Another World Liner Arrived in Shanghai

The Third Cruise Ship of the Year, Carrying 375 Passengers

The White Star Line's cruise ship "Franconia," carrying 375 world travelers, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong last night. The passengers will disembark this morning for a day of sightseeing.

### New Pharmaceutical Industry Hosted a Joint Banquet for Medical Association Representatives Yesterday Afternoon

Over 600 Attendees, Including Xu Xiaochu

The Joint Association of the National New Pharmaceutical Industry of this city, the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry Association, and various pharmacies such as Jiu Fu, Ai Hua, Ji Cheng, Ji Hua Tang, Hua Mei, Sino-French, Sino-Western Sino-American, Nanyang Huayang, Zheng De, and Xin Xing, held a joint banquet at the Chinese Medical Association in Fenglin Bridge yesterday at noon to welcome all representatives from various provinces and cities attending the annual meeting of the Medical Association. Over 600 guests and hosts attended, including Xu Xiaochu, Li Ting'an, Chen Xingwu, Pang Jingzhou, Niu Huilin, and Huang Zifang. The presidium consisted of Xu Xiaochu, Xu Xiangsun, Xu Guanqun, Zhou Bangjun, and Yuan Hesong. During the banquet, Xu Xiaochu rose to deliver a welcoming speech, stating that China's new pharmaceutical industry is still in its early stages, and although efforts have been made to promote it in terms of school classes and manufacturing, it still lags far behind European and American countries. Therefore, we feel a great responsibility, and we must continue to work hard to promote new industries, which will not only benefit national health but also prevent external leakage. We often say that "medicine" and "pharmaceuticals" are two closely related industries, and we feel the need for the medical community's supervision and guidance to promote the progress of pharmaceuticals. We sincerely hope that everyone will give us more encouragement in the future and provide advice at any time so that in five or ten years, Xin Yao will have made greater progress. Subsequently, Pang Jingzhou, Wang Yuanchen, and Zhu Yanggao delivered speeches in response, and various pharmacies, including Sino-French, Sino-Western, Jicheng, Jihuatang, and Jiufu, distributed gifts and commemorative badges at the venue, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere.

### Thousands of Shack Dwellers Plead for Help as the Municipal Council Sets Deadline to Demolish Shanties

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the 25,600 shack dwellers in the Public Concession are facing homelessness as the Municipal Council has issued a notice requiring all straw shacks within the concession to be demolished by May 1st. They have specially sent representatives such as Tang Anping and over ten others to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession yesterday to petition for assistance and intervention. The text of their petition is as follows: "We humbly submit this petition regarding the impending disaster of house demolition, which will leave tens of thousands of citizens without a place to live. We earnestly request your assistance and intervention. We, the common people, toil for a living and have no place to stand.

We Work Diligently All Day

Yet struggle to have enough food. Cramped between the sky and the earth, it is difficult to make ends meet. When fierce winds howl and the cold bites, we can only shield ourselves with thatched huts. The plight of the toiling masses has long been in your esteemed council's contemplation. Last summer, the Public Concession Municipal Council suddenly issued a notice requiring the demolition of our straw shacks in batches by May 1st of this year. If our humble shelters are destroyed, we will inevitably be reduced to wandering in ditches and valleys. Overwhelmed with worry and unable to remain silent, we dispatched representatives to the council to plead for a delay in the demolition. The council initially replied that civilian housing could be built elsewhere, but later stated that there were many vacant houses west of Lan Road, making it unnecessary to build new ones. The previously issued demolition order remains unchanged. Hearing this, we became even more terrified. We humbly believe that administrative officials have a duty to promote

The Welfare of the Public.

The term "public" should not be limited to the propertied class. Those who serve with their labor, working tirelessly from dawn to dusk, also make a significant contribution to the prosperity of society. Moreover, the right to survival is inherent in all. The heart of compassion is in everyone. Who does not have elders and children, or a family? Those who live in magnificent mansions and high-rise buildings should consider the suffering of others who carry their wives and children, wandering the streets without a place to live, and should not bear to deprive them of even the flimsy shelter that protects them from wind and rain for the sake of external appearances. There is still justice in the world, and this order does not seem to be enforceable by force. Furthermore, we are not stubbornly resisting the demolition of our straw shacks. All we ask is for

Civilian Housing

To be built to provide shelter. The system of civilian housing exists in various countries. Our request is by no means extravagant. The council replied that there are already vacant houses available. We wonder if the council will rent them on our behalf, or if we are to rent them ourselves. The former would be too costly and practically impossible. As for the latter, if we had the means to rent, there would be countless mansions in the concession, and we would not need the council's instructions, nor would we be huddled in straw shacks, begging incessantly. We, the common people, are truly unaware of the council's intentions. If the council's words are insincere and intended to deceive, and they are determined to drive us out of the concession, then our settlement in the remote corners of the Chinese area will inevitably lead to the unemployment of over ten thousand people who can no longer work in the concession. While the poor may not be worth pitying, this will inevitably become a

Significant Problem

For society. Your esteemed association upholds the principles of the party and cares for the workers. We have long admired your principles. Now, facing the impending disaster of house demolition and unemployment, we humbly venture to appeal for your assistance. We earnestly request that you negotiate with the concession authorities to build civilian housing and refrain from demolishing our shacks until the construction is complete, thereby benefiting the poor and upholding justice, a win-win for both public good. If the council acts unilaterally and refuses to listen, we will gather together and await our fate, preferring to suffer the consequences together rather than see anyone's shack demolished. This matter concerns our lives and livelihoods, and we speak urgently and without reservation. We await your review and instructions. Respectfully submitted to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession by Tang Anping and 16,000 shack dwellers of the Public Concession."

### Continued Report on the First Voyage of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xiamen-Philippines Route

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSN)'s opening of the Xiamen-Philippines route and the assignment of the Haiheng vessel for scheduled service to facilitate round-trip travel for overseas Chinese passengers have been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the Haiheng vessel's passenger cabin capacity has been confirmed, with 20 first-class cabins, 18 second-class cabins, 56 third-class cabins, 38 Class A fourth-class cabins, and 254 Class B fourth-class cabins. It has been learned that the CMSN recently received a telegram from its agent in Little Luzon stating that the Haiheng vessel returned from the Philippines to Xiamen on April 8th. All first-class and second-class cabins were fully booked in advance, and the fourth-class cabins were also very crowded, with a total of 450 passengers. It is estimated that approximately 11,000 overseas Chinese passengers travel between Xiamen and the Philippines each year, averaging around 200 passengers per voyage. This voyage exceeded the average by a significant amount, and the vessel was said to have returned fully loaded.

### Results of Random Inspection of Smokers Show Many Relapses

Inducement by an Adverse Environment; Orders to Strictly Crack Down on Illegally Established Opium Dens

The Municipal Police Bureau, concerned about the relapses and repeat offenses of smokers in the city who had undergone rehabilitation, has, in accordance with Article 38 of the Regulations for the Implementation of Opium and Drug Prohibition, drafted a method for random inspections and re-examinations of rehabilitated smokers and implemented transmission examinations. The Bureau's Anti-Opium Department randomly selected 2,000 people from the 20,000 rehabilitated smokers and ordered them to undergo random inspections by district. Currently, among the 518 people in the first batch of transmission examinations in the jurisdictions of the Ximen, 16 Pu, Lao Beimen, Wenmiao Road, Dongjiadu, Yimiao, and Xundao Street sub-bureaus, over 30 people were found to still have opium habits and have been handed over to the Songhu Garrison Command for military trial. The reason for this is that the environment in Shanghai is harsh, and all rehabilitated smokers initially registered for rehabilitation due to the prohibition order, but after leaving the rehabilitation centers, they were tempted by the adverse environment and relapsed into their old habits. The Bureau is now stepping up random inspections, hoping that smokers who have already undergone rehabilitation will strengthen their will and not violate the law again. Furthermore, the Municipal Police Bureau, concerned about the illegal establishment of opium dens within the concession by unscrupulous individuals for people to smoke, which is hindering the promotion of opium control, has strictly ordered all districts to diligently investigate and crack down on such activities. Since March of this year, the number of unlicensed smokers apprehended within the concession has been very small, and those apprehended have all been unscrupulous individuals who illegally established opium dens and have been handed over to the Garrison Command for strict punishment. The Bureau's Anti-Opium Department has recently discovered that there are still illegally established opium dens in the Hunan district that provide places for people to smoke, and has strictly ordered the Chenxiangge Police Station, the Wenmiao Road Police Station, and the Ximen Sub-Bureau to step up their investigations and crack down on such activities within a limited time.

### Ding Huikang Discusses Medical Development in Our Country

The Hongqiao Sanatorium in West Shanghai hosted members of the current Chinese Medical Association for the past two days. Yesterday, according to Mr. Ding Huikang, the director of the hospital, he discussed the situation of medical construction in our country, stating that the recent completion of the new buildings and the annual conference ceremonies of the Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, Municipal Hospital, National Shanghai Medical College, and Chinese Medical Association were unprecedented in scale and grandeur. This demonstrates the perseverance of those who have managed the project with great effort and the enthusiasm of all sectors of society, and it is a new dawn for medical construction in our country. In Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners pay attention to public hospitals, if calculated by population, there is still a great shortage. If it can develop in an orderly manner in the future, it will greatly benefit the health of the citizens. However, as far as the national medical construction is concerned, and the most needed by the current society, it is a large number of public hospitals for the common people. In other words, not only should there be perfect hospitals in big cities, but also well-equipped public hospitals for the common people in all parts of the country. In the current situation of our country, the farmers are bankrupt and the economy is declining. If they occasionally suffer from diseases, they feel powerless to seek medical treatment. The impact is not only the loss of individual happiness, but also the promotion of the crisis of the entire nation. Last year's failure of our country's World Games is a simple example. Although, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. At this time, we can only concentrate the national economic power and discuss the development of medical construction to improve the health of the nation. But modern medicine is not a passive charitable cause but an active construction project. In other words, today's medicine has moved away from the old ways of treatment and towards prevention. To achieve this goal, a large amount of economic strength is needed, just like war. To overcome all pathogens, the cost is at least comparable to that of war preparation. However, in the current economic downturn, it is difficult to concentrate a large amount of economic power to develop medical construction. Therefore, after repeated consideration and reference to the successful paths of medical care in various countries, the public medical system is indeed an urgent task at present, and the small unit of disease insurance is the foundation of this system. Just like a country, the general construction must of course collect income tax from the people of the whole country, and disease insurance is no different. If we concentrate the health insurance expenses of the people of the whole country, and after having a huge economic power, then the development of medical construction and national health will be a natural result. Therefore, all nationals should understand the advantages and disadvantages of this. Looking at the major powers, the perfection of the organization of various social insurance laws, and the development of medicine are completely proportional to the strength of a country. If our country does not catch up quickly, the future is a matter of great concern not only in the world front, but also in the individual's ten years of hard work in the sanatorium business. But in terms of the medical construction of the whole country, this is only a drop in the ocean. In the future, the real success will undoubtedly be the official start of the development of medical construction in our country when the national disease insurance organization method is popularized. If this can be done, it will not be difficult to build 20 specialized research institutes, 50 perfect sanatoriums, 100 large-scale new colleges, and 1,000 public hospitals for the common people in a short period of time, so that all eight people in the country can be protected by medicine. I hope that colleagues in the medical field and health authorities will study this issue concerning national health more carefully, and if it can be implemented as soon as possible, the value of the harvest in the future will be higher than everything else.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Denies Submitting a Request to the Ministry to Abolish Double Salaries

Recent reports stated that all crew members of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSN) declared in support of the four demands of the Ningjing vessel crew members, including the statement that the current authorities had requested the Ministry of Communications to abolish the double salaries of the company. Yesterday, a person in charge of the company stated that the company had not requested the Ministry of Communications to announce the abolition of employee double salaries as reported. He had strictly ordered the captains of each vessel to pay attention to a thorough investigation and handling of the matter. The original order of the company is recorded below: It has been reported that all crew members of the company have declared in support of the four demands of the Ningjing vessel crew members, including the statement that the current authorities, taking advantage of the rise in freight rates and increased revenue in the shipping industry, suddenly used reform as an excuse to request the Ministry of Communications to announce the abolition of double salaries and "besides arguing on the basis of reason, they also decided to support each other unanimously." It has also been discovered that someone is distributing leaflets with similar wording. The double salaries for the company's fifth year have been handled according to previous practice. The company has always been open and transparent in all matters concerning employees. The company has not requested the Ministry of Communications to announce the abolition of employee double salaries as reported. Not only are the files available for review, but all employees of the company are aware of this. Furthermore, regarding the reorganization of the company, in February of last year, a proclamation was issued by President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, requiring that it be handled seriously, and that if employees had any suggestions regarding the reform of the company, they could submit them to their superiors for consideration. If they do not follow the proper channels and proceed with their own private intentions, or even be deceived and manipulated by external troublemakers, incite disturbances, and affect the progress of the company's business, they will be deemed to have violated discipline and disrupted communications and will be severely punished according to the law without any leniency. This has already been issued and posted by the company for general knowledge. Many of the company's employees understand the righteousness and are able to appreciate this intention. If the crew members of each vessel have any opinions on the company's measures, they should report them to the company through the captain for review and handling, and they should not be deceived by others and cause trouble for themselves. It is now discovered that the statements in the reports and leaflets appear to be someone fabricating facts and spreading biased and inflammatory remarks in the name of all crew members. Their intention is to have other agendas. The captain of the vessel should pay close attention to this and conduct a thorough investigation to determine whether the declaration was issued by the company's crew members and report it to the company for strict handling. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance. This order.

### The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) Hires Cheng Yanqiu to Perform

The Shanghai YMCA is an international organization with the purpose of serving society, promoting culture and art, advocating public welfare and charity, and connecting young people. Its members are mostly leaders from political, business, and academic circles. There are fifteen organizations established in various cities in our country, with Shanghai being particularly developed. Every Tuesday, the association holds a meeting and dinner, and invites celebrities to give speeches to enhance the knowledge of the members and broaden their social circle.

Mr. Cheng has graciously agreed to participate, and it is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.

### "Resurrection" a Great Success

The Northern European "Jade Hall Spring" Brought to the Stage

The "Resurrection" staged by the Xin Nan Drama Society has been performed at the Carlton since the 8th. Although the play is based on a foreign novel, the plot is quite similar to the story of "Jade Hall Spring" in Chinese old dramas. It tells the story of a simple village girl who is seduced by a nobleman's son and ends up becoming a prostitute, committing crimes, and wandering around, experiencing all the bitterness of the world. The ending is even better than "Jade Hall Spring," leaving the audience with a sense of emptiness. The first act, the prison visit scene, is particularly moving, with the two actresses lamenting the past and unable to control themselves. The audience is also filled with sadness and admiration. Both performances last night were sold out, and those who came late were inevitably disappointed. The play will only be performed in Shanghai for four days, so don't miss the opportunity to see it.

### Banning Unofficial Doctors

— Zhi Min

The municipal health bureau discovered that Tu, a certain individual from Meifu Lane, Parker Road, is an unofficial doctor who is independently running medical business and frequently publishing ads on city newspapers. He also promotes fake, exaggerated ads on the treatment and experience of venereal diseases, which violates the sanitary regulations and harms the society. Therefore, the bureau has sent a letter to the Public Concession to help ban him. Shanghai has three excessive things, unfortunately, doctors take one place. Doctors are meant to create benefits for the society. It seems that being excessive in this aspect would not be annoying, but to be ranked with hooligans and prostitutes is very unfortunate for doctors. However, this is reasonable because the great doctors are not available for poor people. Patients need to pay for the consultation and registration fees and there are different fees for Chinese and foreign concessions. Once the poor get sick, there is no choice other than to “lie down and wait for death.” Although it is inevitable for a person to get sick, the distance between patients and doctors is too far, so they don't have good feelings on doctors' goal on "creating benefits for the society." Many people have talked about this issue. The establishment of hospitals for the common people is also a remedy to this problem. Now that the doctor issue is being mentioned again, I still humbly request the great doctors to reduce the burden on the patients as much as possible within the scope of possibility. You need to know the number of poor people in Shanghai (which is China). If there is accurate statistics, it will shock the big fat cats who live in mansions and ride cars.

Perhaps because of the reasons above, unofficial doctors who “specialize in venereal diseases and treat internal and external medicine” are filling the market. This has unfortunately created another reason for doctors to be ranked as one of the three excessive things in Shanghai. Most of them are assistants or pharmacists. Some of them even put up a doctor sign outside their house after reading some books on “Medical Compendium.” As for those who “frequently publish ads on city newspapers and promote fake, exaggerated ads on the treatment and experience of venereal diseases” such as Tu, it is impossible to count, and they seriously harm the society!

However, from another perspective, why is the business of these unofficial doctors especially developed in venereal diseases? There is no need to say more about this reason. Looking at the report of China Public Opinion Weekly a few days ago: “There are about 25,000 people in the prostitution industry in Shanghai, excluding other disguised prostitution such as massage parlors, escort companies, and dance schools.” According to another magazine report: The victims are mostly small businessmen and coolies. After they get infectious diseases, it seems that they can only turn to the corner of the newspaper to find ads for “five yuan to cure leucorrhea.”

Therefore, before "banning unofficial doctors," I would like to propose two additional conditions: First, as mentioned above, I hope that official doctors can reduce the burden on patients and set up more hospitals for the common people; second, it seems that measures should also be taken to save the 25,000 people who spread venereal diseases.

### Silly Baldy

— Xu Hong

We have a very fun and interesting person on "Duck Bay Street," who is the silly baldy that everyone in the county knows. Whenever he comes to the street, you can hear everyone in the shops calling out to him: "Silly Baldy, jump!""Silly Baldy, jump!" He seems not to hear it, and walks forward, swaying. When people see that he ignores them, they follow him, sometimes even blocking him and forcing him to jump. He has no choice but to put his bare feet together, shrug both shoulders upward, and say, "I'll jump." In reality, he only makes a jumping gesture, and his feet don't leave the ground. Then everyone laughs loudly.

He is a servant at the public hospital at the west end of our street. Every day he has to go to the street to buy things. Every time he goes to the street, he must come to our shop to drink. When I see him, his hair is already completely white, he is barefoot all year round, bald, wears a gray cloth short jacket, ties a straw rope around his waist, and wears a pair of broken blue cloth single pants. He walks into the shop, doesn't say a word, and places a big coin very solemnly on the counter, his eyes shining as he stares at the rows of wine vats in the counter. The people sitting in the shop drinking shout to him from here and there: "Silly Baldy, come, I'll give you wine to drink." He ignores them. The waiter who ladles the wine says:

## Page 18

"Silly Baldy, one big coin isn't enough to buy wine. Jump for me and I'll ladle some for you to drink." He indeed shrugs his shoulders and says, "I'll jump." The waiter laughs and ladles a little for him. He drinks it all in one gulp and then leaves. One day when he came, his head was "full of scars." A waiter joked, "Oh! Silly Baldy has caught syphilis!" He walked out of the shop. People on the street stopped him, wanting him to jump, and asked him what the bloody scabs on his head were. He said: "Alas! Syphilis."

Once, a waiter saw bloodstains all over his blue cloth pants and said, "Silly Baldy, have you got sores? There's a large stone slab outside, you can sit on it and it will be better." He ignores him. Someone drags him to the outside of the shop, points to the large stone in front of the steps that is prepared to be a guidepost, and wants him to sit. He indeed sits on it. At that time, it was the hottest time of the summer, and the stone slab was as hot as fire. He couldn't sit still, and quickly stood up. Everyone in the shop laughed loudly. The waiter said, "Silly Baldy, they tricked you, quickly scold them." He said: "I'll scold them." Another said, "Hey, you stupid thing! I told you to scold them!" He still says: "I'll scold them."

Adults like him and play with him, and children like him even more. People often take time to go to the hospital to see him. But after the autumn of the year he sat on the stone slab, he didn't come for four consecutive days. Because I was helping the waiter deliver wine, I didn't have time to go to the hospital to see him. On the fourth day, he came when we were eating dinner. He looked like he had a serious illness. His cotton-padded jacket was torn very badly, and clumps of black cotton stuck out from the cloth. His broken pants were even more broken. Both of his thighs were completely exposed, like two trunks of trees that had lost their leaves after autumn. The waiter asked him: "What's wrong? Did you go back to your old house?" He didn't answer. After a long time, he stretched out his hand and said: "Uncle, I'm hungry!" I put a piece of tofu in his hand, and he took it and swallowed it in one bite. The waiter said, "Do you want wine to drink?" His eyes flashed, and the waiter ladled a cup for him. He drank it all in one gulp. Then he said again: "Uncle, I'm hungry." A waiter gave him a bowl of rice, and he ate it all in two or three mouthfuls. After eating, he looked at us, seemingly wanting more. The waiter said: "Go, we're going to close." So he walked away, limping.

From then on, he didn't come for another week. The waiter asked the customers who often drank if Silly Baldy was already dead? The reply was: "He's not dead, because one night he knocked over the lamp and burned a patient's quilt. The manager beat him up and starved him for three days. Later, they said he secretly came out to drink at night and beat him again. Now he's locked up there."

Two days passed and he still didn't come. I took the time to run to the hospital to see him, but couldn't find him. The patients said: "Silly Baldy went to carry yellow earth!" I asked where he was carrying yellow earth, and they all laughed.

Silly Baldy is already dead! The customers who drink said he was beaten to death by the manager.

Without Silly Baldy on the street, everyone doesn't feel lonely. Only after dinner, when everyone is chatting, do they occasionally mention him. He had served in the hospital for more than twenty years. The air on this street was lively because of him for more than twenty years. Now, you can't hear the laughter of "Silly Baldy, jump!" on the street, but occasionally someone comes to our shop after drinking and, in a moment of exuberance, shrugs his shoulders and says "I'll jump," causing everyone to laugh for a while.

### Chess

— Lu Jia

Black and white, round chess pieces create an unpredictable game on a simple chessboard.

We should thank the first person who taught people to play chess. He left behind the chess pieces, the chessboard, and the method of playing, so that later generations could use his thoughts to stick, press, cut off, and supplement… He is like a prophet, revealing his mysteries through simple play. Later generations indulge in it: conceiving, considering, and thinking, applying painstaking effort to each chess piece, creating wonderful layouts. No two chess games are the same. Even after thousands of years, no one dares to say that he has created a chess game identical to that of his predecessors. Nor can anyone fathom the depth of the chess pieces and the chessboard, even if he has spent his entire life's energy in this small battlefield.

Have you ever heard the story of Zhuge Liang using random stones to create a battle formation? This marvelous formation once trapped a general of Eastern Wu inside it. However, this simple chessboard has even more fantastic changes than that formation. It has trapped countless people in it. Even the immortals in heaven use their superhuman thoughts in the changes of these hundreds of chess pieces. It is said that the time for an immortal's chess game is a thousand years in the human world, but even now they have not finished playing.

When I was young, I loved to sit next to a chess table and watch the old men play chess. They twirled their fluttering beards with one hand and reached into the wooden box with the other. Their eyes were fixed on the sparse chess pieces on the board, silently pondering. Each chess piece contained a lot of ingenuity, thus creating a wonderful chess game. Watching them admire each other, trembling fingers placed their own moves. One hand hesitated for a long time on the chessboard before finally placing a chess piece with certainty, yet still examining it with confusion: is there any flaw that can be broken by the enemy? When the situation was determined, there was no gap left on the board for even one piece. They still had half a day to consider, mutually discussing the gains and losses of their opponents.

I also loved to climb onto the chess table and play both sides of the chess game myself: placing black pieces with one hand and white pieces with the other, deliberately making many surprising moves, secretly rejoicing in my heart. Sometimes I deliberately favored the white pieces or favored the black pieces, so that only one color of chess pieces remained on the chessboard. Then I had the pride of a victor. Or I deliberately let one type of chess piece be defeated, and then reverse the defeat into victory from a hopeless position. At this time, I breathed a heavy sigh, as if I had completed a man-made project.

Now I no longer have the leisure to spend my free time by the chess table, and I also have some aversion to this small "universe" because, as a member of society, I am already a chess piece placed by others in this large "chessboard."

### The Season of Netting

— Zuo Hua

Once the spring water rises and fills the small river in the village, the Yangtze River, fifteen miles away from home, is surging with muddy yellow water.

At this time, Uncle would take out the broken fishing net that he hadn't touched for a year from the corner of the room where he kept the hoe.

"Cuilan! Mend it, other people's nets are already on the bridgehead!"

The bridgehead is another name for the small river in the village. When the spring tide comes, there is a net every five steps and a dragnet every three steps, hanging on small wooden frames. The scene is very lively!

They lead their children, sitting on the edge of the small river. The newly sprouting green grass spreads out, serving as a cushion and a stage for the children. They each do what they want to do. It looks like that piece of heaven and earth belongs to them!

"Stupid kid, didn't the third row get a blister? Why don't you move it? You should spread out the net and see!"

"It's a small mandarin fish three inches long, nothing else. A small thing."

So the children clamor. You say, "Little Uncle, give it to me to raise!" He says, "Brother, give it to me to put in a small bottle!"

Only the little girls are exceptions, especially the girls around ten years old. They almost never clamor. They hold their dad's or grandpa's hand. If they like a small fish, they usually don't say anything. They just keep looking at their dad's or grandpa's face. If they understand, then they ask the netters for a fish. Then they will happily jump home.

At this time, farm work is leisurely, and the wildflowers in the countryside are just budding. The wheat is growing like chives. Red peach and white apricot are inserted in the hillside. This is naturally a good scenery of the year, sitting on the edge of the small river and netting!

However, those farmers rarely have exciting things to do all year round. Although there are welcoming gods and race meetings in the countryside that can make them dizzy for a while, they always bury their heads in work at ordinary times. They only know that after the rapeseed or wheat grows, they will have to plant beans and transplant rice seedlings again: the beautiful season of netting is also a kind of urging for them, a kind of hint to start working hard.

"(Uncle on the bridgehead! Mr. Zhang in the city asked me to bring a message to you, asking you to pick a big grass carp and send it to his house!... Don't forget it, the day after tomorrow, the day after tomorrow..."

— Oh, oh! The day after tomorrow?

— It won't be wrong, the day after tomorrow!

So, Uncle carefully watched the fishing net. From the muddy yellow small river, he paid attention to every wave; he started counting from the position where he set up the net, all the way down. He couldn't even count the connected nets on the other side. When no one was paying attention to him, he kept shaking his head.

"Raise the net, Uncle! Didn't you see that fish taking water several times already?"

"Oh, a big guy, look! A grass carp weighing several pounds!" Many people gathered around shouting. Uncle's son happily ran to his home to tell his mother.

"Good luck, Uncle! You can have a big meal tonight, right?"

"A big meal? Mr. Zhang in the city already sent someone yesterday to say he wanted one!"

When dusk dyed the entire earth, the nets in the small river were gradually collected. Uncle stayed in a daze, sitting on the edge of the small river, looking at the big grass carp in the fish basket, thinking of the children singing "The fisherman's day is poor."
