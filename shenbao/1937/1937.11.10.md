### Our Left Flank Remains Steadfast, Right Flank Defense Line Moves to New Position

Elite troops are ordered to defend Nanshi to the death. Enemy troops in Shihudang are surrounded by our forces. Fierce fighting occurs outside Songjiang South Gate.

Following the westward movement of our forces in Shanghai West, it is learned that our left flank defense line, stretching from Liuhe through Shixianggong Temple, Guangfu, Xiaonanxiang, all the way to Yaojiadu on the northern bank of the Suzhou Creek, has remained entirely unaffected and steadfast. The new defense line south of Suzhou Creek starts from a point on the Nanhua Highway along the riverbank, extends south through Hongqiao Airport to Qibao Town (approximately eight kilometers west of the International Settlement), then turns east, following the Caohejing Highway to Longhua (approximately seven kilometers south of the Suzhou Creek). In the Nanshi area, capable troops from a certain division, along with the city's police force, will undertake the isolated defense to the death. Thus, the Battle of Shanghai, which has been raging for nearly three months, continues. A military spokesperson for our forces, in a statement to reporters regarding the movement of our defense line, said, "Since the enemy launched hostilities on August 13th, our loyal and brave soldiers have fought fiercely with the enemy's intense artillery fire, using their flesh and blood. For three months, we have been contesting every village and stronghold with the enemy in this small area, inflicting significant casualties. Their heroic and valiant spirit has astonished and impressed the world. The war is still ongoing within the Shanghai area, far from our army's predetermined national defense line for a final, decisive battle with the enemy. With such great achievements, the current situation should not be considered a military failure. Even if our forces move back further in the future, retreating to the national defense line for a decisive battle with the enemy, we can be even more confident that our army will secure the ultimate victory in a protracted war. Therefore, the future of the war of resistance is extremely promising. The people of the entire country should maintain a steadfast and unwavering will, and persevere to the end with the enemy."

Mayor Yu Hongjun of this city stated to reporters yesterday, "Although our forces have been ordered to retreat to a new defense line, they continue to hold Nanshi, Pudong, and areas such as Pusong and Caohejing, to defend our national territory. Since August 13th, the enemy, under the pretext of the so-called Hongqiao Incident, has dispatched a large army to Shanghai, attempting to fulfill their ambition of aggression. For the sake of self-defense, we had no choice but to rise up and resist. Unfortunately, Shanghai has suffered the devastation of war. Although the enemy possesses advanced weapons, we fight for justice. Therefore, the military and civilians have cooperated, and the soldiers have fought bravely. For three months, we have repeatedly inflicted significant blows on the enemy. Even for every inch of advance or retreat, they must pay a considerable price. After Jiangwan and Zhabei successively fell into enemy hands, we have held steadfastly to the western district for more than two weeks. Now that we have voluntarily withdrawn from the western district, we continue to firmly defend Nanshi. Although Nanshi is not a strategic military location, having received orders from the highest military authority, we can only supervise the police and assist the national army to resist to the death, so that the residents within the area can evacuate calmly to avoid being massacred by the enemy. Preserving one person is to strengthen our war of resistance by one point. Should Nanshi unfortunately fall one day, leading to the loss of the entire city, the spirit of the people of Shanghai will endure forever. As for myself, I can only follow the orders of the central government and strive for the country."

### After Our Army Recaptured Songyin and Other Places, They Pursued the Victory and Advanced, Surrounding the Remnants of the Enemy

The Enemy Attacking Shihudang Was Also Cut Off by Our Army

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 8th - The enemy, who had successively occupied Caohejing, Tinglin, Zhangyan, Songyin, Xincang, and Ganxiang, has increased from four or five hundred men to approximately four thousand men. They advanced on Songjiang in two routes, using intense artillery fire to pressure our forces in Pinghu and Songjiang. The situation was tense for a time on the 7th. Later, our fresh troops arrived and dealt a heavy blow to the enemy. Unable to withstand the attack, the enemy collapsed and retreated along the Jinisiniang Bridge and Jinshanwei routes. Our army immediately recovered Songyin, Tinglin, Qianxiang, and Taiping Bridge, and pursued the victory and advanced, surrounding and mopping up the enemy. By the morning of the 8th, over half of the surrounded enemy had been annihilated. Our army is still in the process of encirclement and suppression. On the morning of the 8th, due to clear weather, enemy aircraft were active again, covering the enemy's attempt to break through.

Approximately several hundred enemies, entrenched in the Mishidu area upstream of the Pujiang River, secretly crossed the river at the narrowest point of the Chuanlai Temple riverbank the night before last, landed, and reached Zhangjia Village, six or seven li outside Songjiang South Gate, attempting to harass Shihudang. We have heavy troops stationed there. Although the enemy was stubborn, they ultimately could not succeed. However, the night before last, our army fought fiercely against the enemy near Zhangjia Village, and the sounds of gunfire and artillery could be heard clearly within Songjiang City. There was a great sense of alarm, with everyone being on edge. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers fiercely resisted, killing over a hundred enemies. The enemy's momentum was greatly reduced, and the area was slightly calmer yesterday morning. Our army has gained an absolute advantage, and the people's morale has been greatly boosted.

### The Enemy Fled to Shihudang, and We Surrounded and Vigorously Suppressed Them

Central News Agency Military Correspondent's report at 12:00 AM on the 9th - A portion of the enemy troops who landed at Jinshanwei and fled to Shihudang and Zhangzhuang City were met by our large army and had their retreat route cut off at around 4:00 PM. The enemy fell into a major encirclement by our forces. Although the enemy stubbornly launched attacks, they were vigorously suppressed by us, and over two hundred enemies were annihilated, over twenty were captured, and many firearms were seized.

### The Enemy Invaded Fengxian, and We Pursued and Attacked Them Separately

After landing at Caohejing and Jinisiniang Temple, the enemy invaded Tinglin and Jiangzhuang in Fengxian. Later, they attacked Yexie to the west and Shengzhimiao to the east. Our army fought bravely at Xiaozhoujia Tomb, killing many enemies. On the evening of the 7th, it was suddenly reported that the enemy had also landed on the beaches of Zhalin and Qianjiaqiao. In the middle of the night, a fire suddenly broke out in Nanqiao. There were also reports that the enemy on the beaches of Zhalin and Qianjiaqiao was heading straight for Xinxishi, Qingcun, and Fengcheng. Therefore, administrative organs such as the county government and various bureaus had no choice but to retreat to safe areas. Currently, our army is resisting. At the same time, the local militia and special operations teams are also pursuing and attacking them separately at key locations, and their momentum is quite fierce.

### Our Brave Soldiers Vow to Defend Nanshi

Facing the Enemy Across the River at Rihui Port, the Fortifications Are Strong, and We Will Resist to the End

Central News Agency - Our forces on the south bank of Suzhou Creek in Shanghai West have made a necessary strategic shift to adjust their positions for further combat. However, the highest authorities have ordered a firm defense, and the soldiers ordered to defend Nanshi are also determined to fight the enemy to the death. At the same time, there are no changes in Pudong. Therefore, the Battle of Shanghai, which has lasted for eighty-eight days of bloody fighting, has not only not ended, but has also created a more favorable situation for a long-term war of resistance. This is something that all compatriots in the country should deeply understand. When our army in Zhabei retreated and defended the south bank of Suzhou Creek on the 26th of last month, our loyal and brave soldiers fought bitterly with the enemy, relying on crude fortifications, for two weeks, and their morale was strong and their heroism was extraordinary. They inflicted great damage on the enemy forces who crossed the river to attack. However, the enemy's land and air forces concentrated intense artillery fire and continued bombing, causing much damage to our defense works. At the same time, the enemy who landed at Jinshanwei concentrated their forces and advanced, fiercely attacking Songjiang, causing our forces in Shanghai West to feel threatened and forced to make a strategic move. Before 1:30 AM yesterday, the two armies facing each other across Zhujia Creek were still engaged in fierce fighting. However, under the cover of fierce fighting on the front line, our main forces made an orderly withdrawal. At around 2:00 AM, our army first abandoned the strongholds of Toyota Textile Factory and Zhoujiaqiao and retreated to the line along Guanghua University West, extending east and west through Duzhai and Nanmagou Bridge in Beixinjing. At around 3:00 AM, the Zhujia Creek line also moved south along Bias Road. At around 5:00 AM, after fierce fighting near Lujiazhai on the north bank, the enemy's advance guard of over two hundred men was completely surrounded and annihilated, and our army completely retreated to the new defense line along Qibao and vowed to defend it to the death. At the same time, in Nanshi, the authorities ordered Police Chief Cai Jinjun to lead the city's police force and capable troops from a certain division to defend it to the death and never give up. The morale of our army is high and undiminished. They are now on high alert, vowing to fight the violent enemy to the end.

### The Defense of Nanshi is Consolidated

Our army has been ordered, and the troops holding Nanshi are on high alert. Their main defense line runs along Rihui Port from the southern border of the French Concession to the Huangpu River. All bridges have been destroyed, and their fortifications are exceptionally strong. At noon yesterday, our outpost was still in the Jinyi Road area of Xujiahui. When the enemy detoured through Shanghai West from the south bank of Suzhou Creek to attack us, they came into contact with our small outpost. Although the enemy had three hundred infantry, five tanks, and eight small cannons, they were intercepted by our army and suffered heavy losses before retreating east. At 4:00 PM, the enemy advanced to the west bank of Rihui Port and confronted us. In the evening, the enemy began constructing fortifications in the areas of Shishanwan, Jinyi Road, Fenglin Bridge, and Xietu Road. As for the area along the Huangpu River, there were no signs of the enemy. Our military police and security forces have demarcated defense zones, are cooperating closely, and are on high alert to deal with the enemy.

### The Enemy is Building Fortifications West of Rihui Port

Also, this morning at 3:00 AM, this newspaper received a final report that the enemy forces on the west bank of Rihui Port were still building fortifications between Longhua Road, Damu Bridge, and Xiaomu Bridge at night. Their vanguard troops were in the residential houses of Zhangjiazhai near the area, about 700 to 1,000 meters from the bank of Rihui Port. Our army is firmly defending the area from the east bank of Rihui Port to the Huangpu River. The order in Nanshi is as peaceful as usual.

### The Concession Authorities are Strengthening Defenses

In view of the tense situation yesterday (the 9th), the French army and police authorities stationed in the French Concession in Shanghai strengthened defenses in the areas along Rihui Port and Xujiahui in the afternoon. Multiple armored vehicles and small cannons were deployed and stationed at iron gates in various riverbank locations to maintain the safety of the concession.

According to residents who escaped from Fenglin Bridge yesterday morning, the enemy forces reached Laolonghua in the afternoon. Japanese flags were raised on the Longhua Pagoda and the tallest buildings in the town. At 2:00 PM, the enemy forces reached Xiexu Road. The French Concession authorities dispatched a small squad of about twenty French army soldiers to be stationed near the Dapu Road Bridge to prevent any eventuality.

### Director Cai Talks About Fighting to the End

Central News Agency - Police Chief Cai Jinjun has been ordered to defend Nanshi and has supervised his subordinates to resist desperately, determined to protect this last piece of land in Songhu and coexist with the entire Shanghai. According to reporters, the adjustment of our army's defense line and its westward withdrawal has no impact on the defense of Nanshi. The current defense of Nanshi is exceptionally solid, and the various rumors are absolutely inaccurate. Although the police force is relatively weak, it is our duty to protect the people and defend the territory. Since the War of Resistance in Shanghai, the entire bureau has mobilized, and in addition to working hard to maintain public order and relieve refugees, it has also cooperated with the national army in battles in the city center, repeatedly establishing glorious achievements. Now, due to strategic considerations, the national army has temporarily moved west. It is the duty of this bureau to follow the instructions of the leader and the government and, following the national army, to firmly defend Nanshi. Even if there is only one gun and one bullet left, we will fight to the end and never allow the enemy to completely occupy Shanghai, so as to win dignity for the country and glory for the nation. The person belonging to the military, only has dying for the country in mind. Please tell this to the people of the country. The officials and police officers of this bureau all understand the righteousness of the situation and bear heavy responsibilities. They will certainly be able to go to their deaths generously.

### Enemy Aircraft Bombed Nanshi All Day, and it Suffered a Tragic Fire

Tens of Thousands of Refugees Fled in Panic, Crying and Shouting, a Heartbreaking Sight

Central News Agency - Yesterday (the 9th), starting at dawn, enemy aircraft flew to the skies over Nanshi and Pudong. Each time, there were at least one or two aircraft, and at most five or six aircraft, taking turns coming and going, circling and spying. Until 3:30 PM, twelve enemy aircraft, divided into five batches, with three aircraft in the first two batches and two aircraft in the last three batches, successively flew to the skies over Nanshi and Pudong and bombed indiscriminately. Over twenty bombs were dropped in the Yangjiadu and Zhangjiabang areas of Pudong, and the damage is unknown. As many as twenty-two bombs were dropped near the Gaochang Temple and Jiangnan Shipyard in Nanshi. Fires broke out where the bombs landed, and the burning was quite intense. The fires had not been extinguished by night. Two bombs were dropped at the Manufacturing Bureau Road Bethel Hospital, landing in open areas with no damage. Two bombs were dropped near the South Railway Station, and a section of the tracks was destroyed.

### Guanghua University Was Burned Down by the Enemy

National News Agency - After our garrison on the south bank of Suzhou Creek in Shanghai West withdrew yesterday morning due to strategic considerations, enemy forces advanced to Fenglin Bridge and Guanghua University on Daxilu. The university has been burned down by the enemy, which is a consistent tactic of destroying our cultural institutions.

Dagong News Agency - At the end of Zhongshan Road and in the Hualun Road area in Shanghai West, fires suddenly broke out from the bombings, raging fiercely, with black smoke rising into the sky. It is reported that most of the houses and factories in the area have been destroyed, and the losses are enormous.

### Civilian Houses in Nanshi Burned Fiercely

Yesterday, multiple enemy planes in Nanshi dropped incendiary bombs in the Outer Rihui Bridge area and Xietu Road area starting at 8:00 in the morning. There were mostly straw sheds in the area, so a large fire broke out and continued to burn until the afternoon. All the small factories and thatched houses in the area were reduced to ashes. Residents of Nanshi flocked to the concessions, and the Fangbang Bridge area was blocked. Another group of refugees, supporting the old and leading the young, fled to the City God Temple in the refugee area inside the city, and their situation was extremely miserable.

Also, at around 2:00 PM, a fire broke out at the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Station, and the flames soared high into the sky, making it impossible to approach. The intensity of the fire could be seen even from the rooftops of the concessions.

Also, at around 3:00 PM, two teams of six enemy planes circled over the skies over Xiexu Road and Jumen Road in Shanghai West, taking turns dropping bombs. Fires broke out in multiple locations, and the flames soared into the sky, burning for a long time.

### Swimming to Escape Under the Fire

Yesterday morning at around 5:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the Dapu Road area in Shanghai West. The fire was raging fiercely in the area south of the Chinese Pencil Factory west of Rihui Port (that is, Xiexu Road Bridge). The burned area included the entire Shanghai Galoshes Factory and civilian houses and thatched sheds, totaling over a hundred and ten buildings. The French Concession fire engines arrived after being alerted, but they were blocked by the riverbank and could not carry out rescue work on the north bank of the river. Residents swimming across the river were extremely crowded. Until 2:00 PM, the fire was very intense, causing the Xiexu Road Bridge in front of the New National Pulp Printing Company to burn. According to refugees who escaped from the area, there were a total of four or five fires, so many factories east and west of Dapu Road were affected. The burned area was very large. Although the fire had subsided slightly by 3:00 PM, it had not been completely extinguished.

### Tens of Thousands of Refugees Crying and Shouting

Yesterday afternoon, the situation in the four suburbs of Shanghai became even more tense. Refugees from the southwestern areas of Shanghai, such as Longhua, Caohejing, and Rihui Port, were carrying the old and leading the young, walking along the ports, with as many as forty to fifty thousand people. They were planning to enter the French Concession, but the French Concession area along Rihui Port was blocked by barbed wire. Even if there were ferries, they could not pass, causing a complete blockage outside the iron gates in various places, with loud cries and shouts, and the situation was extremely tragic.

### Charity Organizations Dispatched Vehicles to Rescue

New News Agency - After our army moved back to defend the new defense line, the residents of the four rural areas of Shanghai were fleeing to Shanghai with the old and the young because they could not bear to be brutally massacred by the enemy. They gathered on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, and the situation was very miserable. Upon hearing the report, the local charity organizations dispatched a large number of ambulances to rescue them. They returned to Shanghai in the evening and rescued about 400 refugees, who were sent to the organization's shelter in the Nanshi refugee area for resettlement. According to a rescue worker, enemy planes were circling over the areas where the refugees were gathering and strafing them with machine guns. When members of the organization ventured to rescue them, about dozens of refugees were unfortunately massacred.

### Do Not Waver in Belief, Pan Gongzhan

Protecting Greater Shanghai

When our troops withdrew from Jiangwan and Zhabei, I advised the citizens not to regard it as abandoning Shanghai. Now that our troops are making a strategic withdrawal from western Shanghai again, I still want to loudly advise the citizens not to regard it as abandoning Shanghai. Regardless of whether our military and police are still ordered to hold Nanshi and will coexist with the position, even if one day we also reluctantly withdraw due to terrain and strategic reasons, we must not think that we are willing to abandon Shanghai. In short, "Protecting Greater Shanghai" is the expectation of all our people and the belief of all our people. No matter how the military situation changes, this belief must be firmly established and unshakable.

Perhaps some people say, what is the use of having this belief without power? Little do they know that belief is the function of the spirit, and with belief, power can be generated. If we want to have the power to "Protect Greater Shanghai", we must first have the confidence to "Protect Greater Shanghai". If confidence first shakes itself, what else can we talk about power? First, we must be truly aware of the responsibility of the War of Resistance and not solely blame the army. The task of "Protecting Greater Shanghai" must be resolutely undertaken by all the citizens of the city. If the citizens of Shanghai, everyone, sees danger and gives up their lives, and is mentally united with the spirit of not seeking exemption from difficulties, and can truly contribute money if they have money, and contribute strength if they have strength, and cannot be subdued by power, cannot be corrupted by wealth, and cannot be moved by poverty and humility, and continue to move forward without turning back despite all setbacks, I think that with the status of Greater Shanghai and the financial resources of Greater Shanghai, it can make a great contribution to protecting the whole country, let alone just protecting a city of Shanghai. If our beliefs are shaken because of the temporary withdrawal of the army, and we think that Greater Shanghai is finished from now on and cannot be protected, it is tantamount to admitting that the War of Resistance is only a matter for the army, and what words can we use to explain the "All-People War of Resistance"?

Secondly, we must clearly recognize that the Songhu War of Resistance in the past three months is really only the beginning of a full-scale war of resistance and a protracted war of resistance. Although our troops have successively withdrawn from Jiangwan, Zhabei, and western Shanghai, during the three months of bloody resistance, countless materials have been consumed by the enemy, and countless combat power of the enemy has been weakened. In the sense of a full-scale war of resistance, it is still a victory. Moreover, in terms of the situation of the battlefield, on the one hand, we are still guarding Nanshi, and on the other hand, the large army position between Jiading and Nanxiang is still unusually stable. Today, we retreat for strategic reasons. How can we know that in the future we will not advance for strategic reasons? As long as our patriotic citizens and our loyal and brave soldiers are always connected in spirit, helping each other, and encouraging each other, then the retreating position at present will one day be recovered. In other words, "Protecting Greater Shanghai" will eventually be able to complete its task. At this time of military panic and fluctuating hearts, we especially need to grasp our beliefs, not let the traitors be active, not let the puppets show their faces, and use our spirit of unity, arouse our perseverance to never turn back, and build the upper city of "Protecting Greater Shanghai".

### Our Country Vows to Resist to the End Until Territorial Sovereignty is Recognized

Japan's Strength Consumption is Not What Germany and Italy Want. The Restoration of Peace in the Far East is a Concern for All Powers. The London Times' Commentary is Insightful

[London] The Times today carried an editorial, saying that Italy's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact is only a reaffirmation of Italy's abhorrence and fear of communism. Although some commentators have tried to make the neighboring countries of the three countries feel frightened, it is currently more appropriate to accept it at its face value. At the same time, the Brussels Conference focuses on being pragmatic, and its letter of application to Japan is worded tactfully, so that if Japan accepts it, it can show its willingness to discuss the peace with the powers. Germany and Italy are both deeply concerned about the restoration of peace in China. Both countries are afraid that Japan will be exhausted by the war, and that China will be troubled by the war, so that communism will take the opportunity to invade. The newspaper believes that China is determined not to stop the war until it achieves its goals, or is sure that there is no hope of achieving its goals. If China has the ability to continue the War of Resistance for one day, its government cannot negotiate peace with Japan for one day, and listen to Japan's control of a large part of China's land. China's death battle with the aggressor this time is very brave. Now although it is gradually feeling difficult, the whole country's determination to resist the war is extremely enthusiastic. A solution that is not based on the recognition of China's rights will only prolong the war and will not establish peace. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 9th)

### The Situation of the Far East Conference Suddenly Changed, and Litvinov Left Brussels in Anger

Extremely Annoyed at Being Excluded from the Committee. Non-Public Meeting Postponed to Today.

⊙Brussels The Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, who attended the Nine-Power Conference, is scheduled to leave for Moscow tonight. It is heard that this development is due to Litvinov's dissatisfaction with the attempt to exclude the Soviet Union from the about-to-be-established mediation committee or the steering committee. Italy, which recently joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, now has the possibility of participating in the steering committee and the mediation committee or any of them, which is also what the Soviet Union is dissatisfied with. Because although the Soviet Union is not a signatory country to the Nine-Power Pact, its borders are adjacent to China and Japan, and it is a country that is more related to the Far East than Italy. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Bodankin is still staying in Brussels, but the withdrawal of the entire Soviet delegation is what Italy wants. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 9th)

⊙Brussels The non-public meeting of the Nine-Power Pact Conference, which was originally scheduled to be held this afternoon, has now been postponed to 3:00 PM tomorrow. Also, the chief representative of France at the Nine-Power Pact Conference, that is, Foreign Minister Delbos, is scheduled to arrive here by car from Paris at 8:15 tonight. British Foreign Secretary Eden can fly here at 1:54 this afternoon. (Central News Agency, Havas, 9th)

[London] After returning to the country, British Foreign Secretary Eden originally intended to stay in London and no longer participate in the Nine-Power Pact Conference. Now, he suddenly set off for Brussels this morning, which is unexpected. British semi-official sources generally say that the Nine-Power Pact Conference may see great developments, and the foreign secretary must go in person. After the foreign secretary arrives, the chairman of the conference, that is, former Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, will meet with him to exchange views on the progress of the conference. (Central News Agency, Havas, 9th)

⊙Brussels The chief representative of the United States, Davis, had frequent contacts with representatives of various countries today. At noon, he had lunch with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. After the meal, he held talks with the British acting chief representative, that is, the British Dominion Minister MacDonald. He then went to the Belgian Foreign Ministry to have talks with members of the Belgian delegation. (Central News Agency, Havas, 8th)

⊙Brussels The representatives of the countries at the Nine-Power Pact Conference all hope today that Japan's reply to the Belgian government will be worded subtly, so that the future mediation struggle will continue to be open, and at the same time, it will take the opportunity to carry out its military operations to achieve its goals. Some diplomats believe that Japan may cooperate with the small committee designated by the Nine-Power Pact Conference if there is no Soviet Russia in it, in order to solve the Far Eastern situation. However, another part of diplomats have doubts about what kind of basis to conduct mediation. (9th, National News)

### We Are Determined to Reject Mediation Outside the Conference and Deny Direct Negotiations

⊙The Chinese delegation in Brussels announced today that the Chinese government is bound to reject the mediation of any third country that is not at the conference, and insists that Sino-Japanese negotiations can only obtain a satisfactory solution on the basis of the Nine-Power Pact. (8th, Haitong)

Berlin The Chinese Embassy in Germany announced this morning that it had received a message from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denying that China and Japan were conducting direct negotiations to stop the Far Eastern conflict, and pointed out that no other mediation had been carried out except for the Brussels Conference. (8th, Haitong)

### England and America Plan Political Demonstration; Germany Said to Be Appointed as Mediator Is Still Prevailing

[Berlin] The semi-official German News Agency recently released a message stating that the United States and the United Kingdom, along with the Soviet Union, are now planning to use the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to hold a political demonstration against the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by Italy, Germany, and Japan on November 6. British Foreign Secretary Eden has returned to Brussels from London with a draft of his speech, preparing to deliver it at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. This speech will first be agreed upon with the American representative. It is also said that the matters discussed by the US Chief Delegate Davis and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov during their talks in Brussels yesterday concerned this issue as well. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)

[Berlin] Regarding the matter of Germany mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute, rumors are still rife. Political figures here are quite surprised by this and say that this claim has been denied by both the Chinese and Japanese governments and is not credible. However, the fact that there are such rumors suggests that Germany holds a quite important position among the major powers. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Japan May Participate; Final Decision at Friday's Cabinet Meeting

⊙Brussels A statement issued by sources very close to the Japanese Embassy in Brussels indicates that Japan may participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. It is said that Japan, in order to fulfill the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, has been conducting full and frank discussions with representatives of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy in Tokyo. The statement also claimed that the current conference is authorized by the League of Nations, and the Soviet Union is participating, even though it is not a signatory to the treaty. Therefore, if Japan is willing to send a representative to participate in the conference, it would be an important indication of Japan's spirit of mediation and a genuine concession. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 9th)

[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota stated at today's cabinet meeting that the invitation for Japan to attend the Brussels conference and cooperate in resolving the Sino-Japanese conflict requires considerable time for consideration and can only be decided at the next cabinet meeting on the 12th. (Haitong Electric, 9th)

### US Public Opinion's Observation: Difficult to Achieve Results from the Conference

[Washington] Regarding the current international situation, American public opinion is generally concerned about the complex and intricate global diplomatic situation, as can be seen in newspaper commentaries and private conversations. The general consensus here is that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be very difficult to achieve any results. The terms of the Anti-Comintern Pact among Italy, Germany, and Japan that have been disclosed are not of great danger, but the new alliance formed by these countries has established a foundation in world politics. Its scope of activities is almost unlimited because these countries can use the pretext of eliminating communism and use various excuses to act independently or jointly anywhere in the world. It is generally believed that Italy, Germany, and Japan will try to persuade European countries to join the Anti-Comintern Pact and that efforts will also be made to attract countries in the Americas. If this happens, the unified ideological situation in the Americas will be threatened, and the united front formed by the Pan-American Conference last year (to prevent countries outside the Americas from interfering in American affairs) will be at risk of being destroyed. Regarding the current situation in the Far East, President Roosevelt originally had the possibility of making further statements after his speech in Chicago on October 6, but it is feared that American public opinion will revert to conservatism. The establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Italy, Germany, and Japan may accelerate its return to isolationism. Now that the US Congress is about to reconvene, President Roosevelt is hesitant to make any statements. (Zhong Shi She, Havas dispatch, 8th)

### General Chiang Pai-li Meets Italian Representative

Bishop Yu Pin Visits Belgian King

⊙Brussels General Chiang Pai-li and Bishop Yu Pin visited the Italian representative Adolfo Venturi yesterday and held lengthy talks. General Chiang is scheduled to return to Berlin tonight and will go to Rome to meet Chen Gongbo, planning to stay in Rome for about ten days. Chiang has also agreed to write an article for a German official military newspaper on China's resistance and future victory. (Central News Agency, 9th)

⊙Brussels Bishop Yu Pin will broadcast a speech here tonight, detailing the general development of China and the close cooperation between the church and the government. After the speech, he will go to the Netherlands, where the Dutch Catholic Church has prepared a welcome. It is said that Bishop Yu will broadcast speeches to the Dutch public about the actual situation in China and lecture at the Catholic University of the Netherlands. After that, he will return to Brussels and give speeches at the Catholic University of Leuven, the University of Liège, and the university professors' conference. Then, on the 16th, he will go to Rome, and on the 26th, he will go to Switzerland. Regarding his mission to Rome, Bishop Yu said that he had met with the Pope several times in Rome. The Pope has not only donated 85,000 lire to aid Chinese refugees but has now donated another 100,000 lire. The Pope's attitude towards China is the same as announced in 1928, expressing deep sympathy for the suffering of the Chinese people in the current events. Bishop Yu's visit to Belgium has had a significant impact on the Belgian Catholic newspapers. For example, Belgium's largest Catholic newspaper reprinted an article by former Italian Finance Minister Stefani on the organization of the Chinese army, which was very favorable in its criticism of our country. King Leopold II of Belgium received Bishop Yu Pin today and inquired in detail about the situation in China. The King stated that any peace that is not based on justice cannot be established. Since the King is about to visit King George VI of England, Bishop Yu requested that the King explain the current situation in China in detail when meeting with the monarchs of various countries.

### Italy Joins Anti-Comintern Pact; Soviet Union Protests to Italy

Believes It Violates Treaty of Friendship; Relationship Between the Two Countries Hangs by a Thread

[Rome] The Soviet Union has formally protested against Italy's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact of the three countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan. It is reported that the Soviet Ambassador has informed Italian Foreign Minister Ciano that the Soviet Union considers Italy's participation in the agreement an "unfriendly act." The Soviet Union also accused the Italian government of violating the Treaty of Friendship signed between the Soviet Union and Italy in 1933. When the Soviet Ambassador visited the Italian Foreign Minister yesterday, the Foreign Minister stated that the purpose of the agreement was to oppose the Third International and not to oppose the Soviet Union. Therefore, there is no reason for the Soviet Union to oppose it.

### German-Italian Axis Expands into a Triangular Alliance

Germany Is No Longer Isolated; Hitler Is Satisfied; Said That Japan Will Grant Economic Benefits to Germany and Italy

⊙Munich Today is the anniversary of the Nazi Party's uprising here in 1923. Führer Hitler personally came here to preside over the celebration and gave a speech, saying, "Today's Germany is no longer isolated. Many other countries that do not agree with the ideals of the League of Nations have formed alliances with us. The Anti-Comintern Pact recently concluded by Italy, Germany, and Japan is based on this spirit. The political axis between Germany and Italy was originally limited to Europe, but now it has been extended and has become a large triangle in international politics. The three countries, Italy, Germany, and Japan, that form this triangle have decided to safeguard their own rights and interests related to their survival." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)

[London] According to reports from Rome, the Japanese government has allowed Germany and Italy to enjoy economic benefits in the Chinese territories occupied by Japan. If this is confirmed, officials must conduct an investigation because if Germany, Italy, and Japan have indeed concluded this economic agreement, it would greatly contradict the principle of the Open Door Policy in China. However, so far, it has not been possible to confirm the existence of an economic agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan regarding China. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)

⊙Prague Regarding the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by Italy, Germany, and Japan, the Czech Daily recently commented, "Although this agreement superficially opposes the Soviet Union, it actually opposes Britain, the United States, and France. Geographically, the Soviet Union does not feel threatened. On the contrary, the naval bases of Britain in Singapore, France in Vietnam, and the United States in the Pacific are all threatened by Japan. In addition, Egypt is threatened by Italy, and London and Paris are threatened by Germany. In the future, Italy, Germany, and Japan can accuse certain democratic countries of participating in the 'destructive actions of the Third International' and interfere in their internal affairs. From this perspective, the Anti-Comintern Pact violates the most important principle of modern international relations, which is that the internal affairs of other countries should not be interfered with."

[London] German Ambassador Ribbentrop flew here from Munich today and will attend the banquet of the new Lord Mayor of London tonight.

The German Ambassador will likely explain the political value of the Anti-Comintern Pact, believing that it is only an ideological agreement and will not threaten Britain. Furthermore, the three countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, have not signed any treaty stipulating that special commercial concessions in the Chinese territories occupied by Japan will be granted to Germany and Italy. (Havas Electric, 9th)

[Berlin] American public opinion has recently been commenting on the Anti-Comintern Pact between Italy, Germany, and Japan, causing a negative impression among German diplomatic circles. An evening newspaper reported, "The goal of this agreement is not to suppress existing revolutionary movements by force, but to prevent potential revolutionary movements from breaking out. If communism is found within a country, it should be eliminated by that country using its own strength." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)

### Japanese Fishing Boats Fishing in US Territorial Waters

United States Will Negotiate with Japan

[Washington] Recently, Japanese fishing boats have been illegally fishing for salmon in Bristol Bay off the coast of the US territory of the Alaska Peninsula, greatly affecting American fishermen. Regarding this matter, the State Department will negotiate with the Japanese government, requesting restrictions. Although Japanese fishing boats are fishing in the high seas near that area, they do not have licenses. Experts at the State Department believe that after the government negotiates with Japan, it may be possible to establish a similar agreement based on the four-nation agreement between the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union, and Canada regarding the restriction of seal hunting along the Arctic Ocean coast.

### Amount of British Munitions Shipped to Japan from July to September This Year

Total Value of More Than 14,000 Pounds

[London] The British House of Commons discussed the export of British munitions to Japan today. Secretary of Commerce Stanley said in response to a question that the British government had previously stated that for the sake of public interest, the content of the export licenses for ordnance and munitions issued by the government and their destinations would not be disclosed. However, what I can say is that from July 1 to September 30, the total value of British ordnance, bullets, naval and army supplies, etc., shipped to Japan was 14,612 pounds. From this number, it can be seen that the amount of British munitions shipped to Japan has been reduced to a very low level in recent months. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### Englishman Mr. Bull Describes the Brutality of the Enemy Troops in North China

Differences of Opinion Between the Japanese Garrison and the Kwantung Army; The Kwantung Army Is Determined to Cut Off Sino-Soviet Contact

Baoding Becomes a Region of Terror

The Continental Daily reports an article written by an Englishman named Bull., stating that recently, due to strict Japanese inspections and traffic disruptions, it is extremely difficult to obtain accurate news from North China. He happened to dine with a foreign student from Peiping (Beijing) who was familiar with current events, and thus learned a little about the recent developments in North China. My friend told me that he has definite evidence that the opinions of the Japanese garrison in North China and the Kwantung Army are very different and they are deeply suspicious of each other. The Japanese garrison in North China seems to have no specific economic or land goals, only holding the vague idea of developing China for the benefit of Japan. The Kwantung Army has a firm goal of cutting off China and the Soviet Union to prevent Soviet influence from extending to China and assisting China through Outer Mongolia. Members of the Kwantung Army have clearly fulfilled their desire to win over several leaders in Inner Mongolia, such as Prince De, who is now serving the Japanese because he resents the treatment he received from the Chinese government in the past. However, many Mongolians are worried because the Japanese demands are very extravagant, and what they get is only an empty name of autonomy. Judging from the experience in Hinggan and other places, all the more intelligent Mongolians feel that what they can hope for under the new government is only a few minor positions, and all the important positions will be occupied by the Japanese. As a result, the Mongolians are merely puppets of the Japanese. It is heard that some Mongolians would rather join Outer Mongolia than be exploited by the Japanese, so my friend believes that the Japanese may encounter serious disputes in that area. As for the North China war situation, the Japanese army suffered significant losses only at Nankou, and there was almost no resistance in other places. The Chinese army could not even blow up bridges and tunnels to cover their retreat, and even if they did damage them, the Japanese army could quickly pass through. The Ping-Sui Railway has a tunnel where the Chinese army tried to block it by blowing up eight locomotives, but experts from the South Manchurian Railway cleared it in two weeks, and the tunnel was reopened. The Japanese army's use of mechanized transportation in various places in western Hebei has been very effective, but it requires a large amount of gasoline and motor equipment. The Japanese army's diet of rice has also made their transportation problem even more difficult. My friend said, "I don't understand why the Chinese army made it so easy for the Japanese army to pass through. Just a few daredevils would be enough to disrupt the Japanese army's communication lines, especially the railway. They should read Lawrence's 'Revolt in the Desert.'" Currently, only Yenching University and Fu Jen Catholic University are open in Peiping. Peking University and Normal University are used as barracks by the Japanese army, and so is part of Tsinghua University's dormitories. The president of Yenching University said that he would rather close the school than have the Japanese interfere in its curriculum. After Baoding was occupied by the Japanese army, there were days of looting. The Japanese army acted like madmen. The week afterwards was almost the most bloody and terrible era in the history of Japan's continental policy. Hundreds and thousands of people were shot. I witnessed hundreds of Japanese soldiers looting, and Japanese officers turned a blind eye. A Japanese officer on horseback robbed an American missionary of a gold watch and a fountain pen, giving him a cheap Japanese watch. The missionary refused to accept it. Another Japanese soldier robbed a beautiful female missionary of a camera. Another soldier wanted to blow up the safe of the American church but was persuaded to stop. Japanese officers ordered the refugees to return to their villages, but many were shot or stabbed by Japanese soldiers on the way. The puppet government established here admitted that the looting was an undisciplined act but said that the Japanese soldiers were angry because they believed that Baoding was an anti-Japanese base. In addition to the American church, which had American flags painted on its roof, being hit by cannons and bombs, the French Catholic Church, which also had French flags hanging and the three characters "Catholic Church" painted one foot square on its roof, was also bombarded by cannons and bombs. This was definitely not accidental. Fortunately, the French and Dutch pastors and nuns in the church were all safe. Last week, Chinese planes came to bomb the city four times, the purpose of which was the Japanese airfield in the east of the city, where fifteen bombers were stationed, bombing the Chinese army's positions. On the morning of October 8, when the Japanese army passed through Baoding again, two armed Japanese soldiers robbed a Chinese doorman of the American church of 20 yuan in legal tender. Also, the benches in the two churches were cut up and used as fuel. All of the above are facts witnessed by a certain foreigner in Baoding.

### Relief for Unemployed Workers

Zhu Xuefan Went to Nanjing Yesterday to Ask for Instructions; Transfer to the Rear to Engage in Production

Therefore, Zhu Xuefan, the chief executive of the committee, made a special trip to Nanjing last night to ask the central government for instructions on how to quickly transfer all workers to safe areas in the rear to engage in production work in order to strengthen the forces against the enemy.

### All Sectors Continue to Donate Comfort Items

The committee issued a receipt on the spot and promised to find a way to transfer it immediately. However, the anti-Japanese soldiers in Shanghai and North China need a large number of binoculars, so it is hoped that all enthusiastic people will generously donate and send them to the Comfort the Troops Association for transfer.

Donations of Soldiers' Raincoats Are Enthusiastically Made

Since the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee launched a campaign to donate 50,000 raincoats to comfort the soldiers on the front lines, it has received enthusiastic support from all sectors, and the results have been quite impressive. Yesterday, Mr. Zhou Bangjun collected 140 raincoats from Lin Mansion on Sapo Road, and the Gan Mansion on Shanhai Pass Road donated 10. Also, Mr. Pu Jiting, through Pu Shuhong, donated five bolts of high-quality raincoat cloth, requesting that they be made into raincoats and transferred to the front lines for application. The raincoats cost 1.6 yuan per piece in national currency. Donations from all sectors can be converted into current currency and sent to the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee for processing. Official receipts will be given.

The members of the Yuanyou Association, which studies and promotes the Hui Ming Taijiquan in this city, are extremely enthusiastic about national salvation work. Recently, in view of the continuous autumn rains and the hard work of the frontline soldiers fighting the enemy in the rain, they launched a campaign to raise 100 raincoats for comfort. All the associations actively contributed, and the collection was announced within half an hour, with a total of 112 yuan. Xu Weigong, Chen Jingzhi, Dong Hanseng, Zhang Jingan, Ye Shantao, Zhu Jinjiao, Zhang Zhengxue, Tian Hexiang, Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Shenfa, and Cheng Jingkang each donated 10 yuan. Zhu Chunfu, Zhang Mucheng, Jin Shuting, Kang Rongchang, Li Zhichao, and Gu Bishan each donated 5 yuan. Chen Jiugao donated 4 yuan, and Yao Linzhi donated 2 yuan, totaling 159 yuan in national currency. It was sent to the Shanghai Special City Party Department yesterday to purchase raincoats for the soldiers.

The birthday of the Founding Father of the Republic is approaching. The No. 1 Wartime Service Corps of the China Boy Scouts will soon receive money from the City Party Department and City Councilor Yao for the celebration, the money will be used for raincoats to comfort the soldiers. The cash donated will be used by the authorities to purchase the raincoats as it is easier to standardize. It is said that they will be divided into four types, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 2 yuan, and 1 yuan, and it is expected that 5,000 yuan will be raised.

### Nanshi Refugee Zone Operational, Accepting Refugees Starting Yesterday

Red Cross Flags Hung on Rooftops All Around; Municipal Police Armed to Maintain Order

Committee Issues Statement

The Nanshi Refugee Zone Management Committee, represented by Chairman Father Jacquinot and six other foreign members, issued a statement yesterday, stating that the proposal to establish the refugee zone has been agreed upon by both China and Japan. This effort by all three parties is purely motivated by humanitarianism. This measure will not infringe upon Chinese sovereignty. It stipulates that the area of Nanshi city and its suburbs, bounded by Fangbang Road to the south, and the French Concession to the east, west and north, is designated as a safe residence for refugees, not subject to any form of attack, with no armed military units or military organs, and no armed hostile activities. Under Chinese civil administration, the Chinese police will maintain order, with their weapons limited to police-issued Mauser pistols or handguns. The committee enjoys complete access to exercise its supervisory powers within this area. If a situation arises that prevents the committee from continuing its guarantee, the committee will notify the Chinese and Japanese authorities and rescind its promise, and all safety guarantees will be revoked. The committee recognizes that all promises have now been kept and announces that, starting at 5:00 PM on November 9th, this zone is open for refugees to reside in under the agreed conditions.

The Shanghai International Relief Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society, due to the expansion of the war zone and the large number of refugees, which cannot be accommodated within the concessions, requested the municipal authorities to designate an area as a refugee shelter for the war zone, while requesting the Japanese side not to bomb the area. This humanitarian appeal has been approved by our military and political authorities and has been implemented since 12:00 noon yesterday. The area is designated as one-third of the old city, bounded by Fangbang Road to the south, and Min Guo Road to the east, west, and north. All intersections near Min Guo Road have been built with solid fortifications. The intersections where Fangbang Road connects to these streets began to be constructed with defensive fortifications yesterday afternoon. Nanyang Bridge at the west end of Fangbang Road leads to the French Concession, and the east end leads to Xiaodongmen, directly to the Huangpu River. Refugees from Pudong can land there and follow Fangbang Road. The boundaries are clear, and the residents within the boundaries are very calm. Two hundred of our police officers are stationed in the area to maintain order. Red Cross flags have been hung around the area since yesterday afternoon for identification. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, International Relief Committee members Jacquinot (Chairman of the Refugee Relief Group), Barnes, Andrews, Yespai, Pengpu, Madden, and Poland and more than ten others, accompanied by Mao Yun and others representing the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, inspected the area for a week. The situation was quite good, and they were all satisfied. According to what the reporter learned from the Nanshi inspection yesterday, public places in the area, such as the Yimiao, Yuyuan, Xiaoshijie, schools, and churches, have been opened as shelters. As the number of refugees increases, more will be opened in succession. According to the size of the area, it can accommodate 100,000 refugees. Currently, the number of refugees fleeing from Pudong and Husi Hunan has reached about 20,000. Many people in the concessions have also moved back. In addition to the responsible persons who have been dispatched by the various hometown associations to handle the accommodation and relief, the association is now preparing to set up an office, which will start working within days. The urban area south of Fangbang Road is still under the responsibility of our police, maintaining order, and the order is quite good. The number of refugees accommodated yesterday was 1,200 at Xiaoshijie, 400 at the Doumiye Guild, and the Hui Mosque, Chenghuang Temple, Yuyuan, Chenxiang Pavilion, Grain Guild, Flour Exchange, and Pearl and Jade Guild on Fuyou Road Houjia Wharf were all arranged separately. In addition, a Nanhuo store in the middle of Old School Field Street also accommodated many refugees, and they were arranged properly until night. Other refugees will continue to be transported to the area for accommodation today. Red Cross flags are hung on the rooftops all around for identification.

### Pudong Refugees Continuing to Cross the River Yesterday

Ferries Crowded Along the Bund; Foreign Warships Dispatch Patrol Boats for Protection

A large number of Pudong residents have been moving to the concessions across the Huangpu River for days. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency inspected the Bund yesterday morning. The ferries were crowded from the French Concession Bund to the Jianghai Customs, and traffic continued without interruption, all loaded with a large number of residents. The British and French Concession police authorities dispatched Chinese and Western police officers, together with British soldiers, to maintain order at the docks. British, American, and French warships also dispatched steamships to protect in the river. Relief organizations such as the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association, the Shanghai Relief Branch, and the Red Swastika Society dispatched a large number of trucks to transport and resettle them in the Nanshi Refugee Zone. Those who could not afford to cross the river were also transported by charitable organizations by hired boats. As of noon, more than 5,000 refugees had crossed the river.

The Red Swastika Society relief team, seeing that the refugees were crowded in Pudong and could not cross the river westward, led a team across the river at 2:00 AM yesterday, rescuing more than 1,000 refugees in various places in Pudong, transporting them to safety in shifts, and sending them to relatives and friends.

### Foreign Warships Intercept Foreign Ships, Foreign Merchants Discussing Countermeasures

The Italian merchant ship Ende, owned by the Italian Chinese Company, sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo the other day. Unexpectedly, it was unreasonably intercepted by an enemy ship on the Tongsha sea, delayed for more than ten hours, and then arrived in Ningbo. After picking up passengers and cargo, it still sailed back to Shanghai on the same day. It returned here at 9:20 AM yesterday. According to the spokesperson of the ship, enemy ships have been frequently intercepting foreign merchant ships outside Wusongkou in recent days, conducting unreasonable inspections and other things, which have had a considerable impact on shipping. Therefore, it is now heard that the foreign authorities have begun to discuss proper countermeasures to maintain business.

### Public Bond Delivery Postponed

The delivery of public bonds on account at the Securities Exchange, after representatives from the exchange and the banking community discussed and decided to postpone it to February 1st of next year, with interest at 8% per month, and was endorsed by the brokers' conference of the exchange, and after personally requesting the Ministry of Finance, it has been many days without a clear reply. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has already basically approved the request, as all parties concerned have already reached a proper solution, and it is not necessary to issue a clear announcement. The Brokers' Association of the exchange also does not need to convene a meeting at present. Therefore, the long-delayed issue of public bond delivery on account can come to an end.

### Enemy Plunders Steel Bars in the Eastern District of Shanghai

Thousands of Tons of Steel Bars Stored in Cai Renmao's Warehouse Hauled Away

The enemy army is plundering the goods stored in our factories and warehouses in the eastern districts of Shanghai, and metal materials are especially favored by them, and they are being shipped back to their country. According to reliable sources, thousands of tons of steel bars stored in the warehouses of Cai Renmao, a well-known metal company in Hongkou, are worth several million yuan and have been hauled away by the enemy army. In the warehouses on Kunming Road, Liaoyang Road, Tangshan Road, Zhoujiazui Road, and Dalianwan Road, in addition to the goods being stolen, many troops are stationed there.

Commentary

### Defend Nanshi to the Death

— Appropriate

Our army on the south bank of the Suzhou River in western Shanghai again made a strategically necessary retreat yesterday. However, our highest authorities in Nanshi have ordered Cai Jinjun, the police chief, to lead the city's police and a strong unit of a certain division to defend the city to the death, and never give up. The defensive fortifications in Nanshi, after months of construction, are quite solid. Moreover, the houses are densely packed together, just like in Zhabei, which is also a condition that is easy to defend. If the enemy wants to seize Nanshi and complete the attempt to occupy Shanghai, I am afraid they will have to suffer considerable significant sacrifices and consumption.

Defending Nanshi to the death is like defending Taiyuan to the death. The military significance is still small, but the political significance is great. Because the two cities of Shanghai and Taiyuan are symbols of the enemy's goal of a quick victory. Even if it cannot be defended in the end and must be lost, it is always better to defend it for one more day for the sake of international hearing and domestic morale. This is one reason. Shanghai and Taiyuan occupy important positions in our country's politics and economy. The enemy wants to seize these two major cities in order to control political and economic power. If we adopt a scorched earth resistance strategy, it will be difficult for the enemy to achieve his goals. This is the second reason.

Of course, under the current military situation, the act of defending Nanshi to the death is tragic. The number of defenders is limited, and most of them are police. After all, it is a tragedy to resist the attacks of a large number of enemy troops. Moreover, after another defensive battle, the prosperous area of ​​Nanshi will inevitably be turned into ruins. However, we must know that we are fighting for the entire nation. If a local disaster can be exchanged for the glory of the entire nation, this disaster is worthy of eternal praise by later generations.

The military and police in Nanshi are now ordered to bear the responsibility of defending to the death. This mission is undoubtedly supremely glorious. May they make redoubled efforts.

### Public Concession Bureau Trials Refugee Placement Work

Advising Factories to Resume Operations and Increase Production Capacity

The Public Concession Bureau has been making every effort in providing refugee relief, food supply, and cargo transportation after the Battle of Shanghai. In order to trial refugee placement and increase industrial production to maintain stable livelihoods, the Bureau has specially appointed Mr. B.K. Hader, Head of the Industrial Section of the General Office, as its representative. Together with Ms. Zhu Yubao, Secretary, they visited Mr. Zhuang Ping, Chairman of the Shanghai YMCA, on the afternoon of the 8th of this month to discuss the introduction of unemployed refugees to work and the resumption of operations by various factories. According to Mr. Hader, the YMCA's registration of unemployed female workers and their introduction to factories for work is a practical form of relief, to which the Bureau expresses great sympathy. Currently, the Bureau, considering the rapidly increasing number of refugees, urgently needs to find ways to place them so they can obtain work and support themselves. Therefore, the Bureau is very willing to cooperate with groups with practical work capabilities to establish contact and jointly trial this refugee placement issue. Furthermore, it hopes that the YMCA will advise Chinese factories to resume operations immediately so that refugees can find a way out and industries can increase production. The Bureau will, within its capabilities, make every effort to assist in all matters. Mr. Hader believes that during this time of war, efforts in production will surely develop various industries, and their products can take the opportunity to be transported to various countries for sales. In response, Mr. Zhuang Ping, Chairman of the YMCA, expressed gratitude for the Bureau's concern for refugees. He stated that various factories are prepared to resume operations in safe areas, but finding suitable factory sites is quite difficult. He hoped that the Bureau could provide practical assistance in this regard first. He also expressed appreciation for the Bureau's willingness to cooperate in refugee placement, and assured that the YMCA would do its utmost to meet these expectations, but eagerly hoped that the Bureau would provide guidance at any time so that they could proceed smoothly together. Both parties exchanged opinions and discussed matters for two hours, and were very satisfied with the results. It is reported that the YMCA has scheduled an emergency meeting of merchants from various countries to discuss practical measures in detail with the Industrial Section of the Bureau.

### Actively Encouraging the Subscription of National Salvation Bonds

Lin Bingyan Solely Purchases 150,000 Yuan, Muslim Religious Friends Voluntarily Subscribe

Special District Group. The First Special District Group of the Citizens' National Salvation Bond Solicitation Corps sent a letter to the captains of each team yesterday, stating that the group has been soliciting National Salvation Bonds for nearly two months. Fortunately, with the enthusiastic support of the captains, considerable results have been achieved. As the frontline war becomes increasingly urgent, the rear's solicitation of bonds should also continue to advance. This special letter is to urge the captains to continue their efforts to expand solicitation and to send the solicited amount along with the first copy of the subscription form to the group for reporting to the main corps.

Guangdong Compatriots. The Guangdong branch of the Shanghai Citizens' National Salvation Bond Solicitation Corps has been making every effort in solicitation since its establishment through the joint efforts of the Guangdong Association in Shanghai, the Guangzhao Guildhall, the Cantonese Overseas Chinese Business Federation, the Chaozhou Guildhall, and the Chaozhou Compatriot Association. Previously, Mr. Lin Bingyan, the captain of the branch, solely purchased 150,000 yuan to encourage his fellow countrymen. This amount was immediately paid to the Guangdong Bank for collection. It is now reported that subscribers are even more enthusiastic. However, as Guangdong compatriots are scattered throughout Shanghai, the branch is concerned that solicitation may not be comprehensive and that those who are enthusiastic may not know how to subscribe. Therefore, it has specially borrowed Room 326 of the New Asia Hotel as a temporary office to facilitate subscriptions. Furthermore, it has broadly recruited team members and distributed small solicitation notices to inform compatriots in Shanghai of how to subscribe and jointly alleviate the national crisis.

Wuxi Compatriots. The Wuxi Compatriot Association in Shanghai believes that National Salvation Bonds are necessary to strengthen national resources and expand war preparations. Since it began to encourage compatriots to subscribe, significant results have been achieved. However, this has not yet met the predetermined total amount. Therefore, it scheduled a meeting at its office at 116 Zhonghui Building yesterday and appointed Rong Zongjing, Jiang Zheqing, and more than ten others as solicitation committee members to be responsible for solicitation. At the same time, subscription payments will be submitted to Zhonghui Bank for transfer to the main association. Once the total amount is met, it will be reported to the main corps for record.

Muslim Organizations. Muslim organizations in the city, recognizing the urgency of the national crisis, believe that contributing wealth to save the country is a national duty. They have specially formed the Muslim Branch of the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee to actively proceed, establishing National Religious Friend Squads and Detachments to promote the responsibility of "giving money if you have it." It is reported that the rules and regulations have been compiled into a booklet. The office is located at the Zhejiang Road Mosque, and religious friends are voluntarily subscribing with great enthusiasm.

### German Community Celebrates the Anniversary of the Nazi Party's Uprising in Germany

Russel Praises Our National Unity, China Has Achieved Spiritual Transformation Today

November 9th is the anniversary of the Nazi Party's Munich Uprising in Germany. The German community in Shanghai also held enthusiastic celebrations. Mr. Russel, the Deputy Leader of the Nazi Party in Shanghai, gave a speech, praising not only the great achievements of the German leader Hitler in transforming the German nation, but also praising China's national unity today in resisting foreign aggression and its hope for future national revival. His speech stated, "We in Shanghai have witnessed China's war of resistance for self-defense for nearly three months, which is an unprecedented feat in Chinese history. Anyone familiar with the history of China in the past 25 years knows that China has achieved a spiritual transformation today. From self-reliance, it has generated a strength that was previously considered impossible by many. What deserves our admiration is not only the bravery and fearless spirit of the Chinese soldiers, but most importantly, the entire nation has united under the name 'China' to become an unbreakable great nation. All forces that were previously divided and unable to cooperate have now united on one front to fight for the sacred task of defending their homeland. Therefore, we dare to offer our sincere sympathy to the Chinese nation and wish them to forever maintain their unity and never again give the enemy an opportunity to invade." Mr. Russel also expressed his deep gratitude for all the excellent treatment received by the German community in China.

### Monks' Rescue Team Bravely Takes Action

Master Hongming Leads Team Members to Rescue Refugees at Fenglin Bridge

After our army's positions west of Shanghai moved south yesterday morning, residents in areas south of Shanghai, such as Longhua, carried boxes and led the elderly and young, fleeing towards the French Concession. However, most of these people are poor farmers, trekking long distances in extreme distress, all heading towards Fenglin Bridge. The tragic situation cannot be fully described in words. Upon learning of this, the Monks' Rescue Team, led by Master Hongming, immediately rushed to rescue them, carrying items for the refugees. At the same time, another team was sent to Zhongshan Hospital to rescue the more than 800 wounded soldiers who had been sent to the hospital for treatment after being injured on the battlefield. Even the smallest item was carefully bandaged and carried out of the hospital. Their bravery and compassionate hearts are truly exemplary. Moreover, the order was well-maintained, which could not have been achieved without thorough training. The reporter, having witnessed the process, was deeply moved and therefore reported it.

### Remaining Embers of the Four Banks Warehouse Spread to the Lower Levels

The Four Banks Warehouse, once where our lone northern army led by Commander Xie and Battalion Commander Yang valiantly stood guard, continues to have thick smoke and flames erupting from it.

### Record of Escape from Songyin

— Remaining Life

Songyin is a small town under the jurisdiction of Jinshan County. It relies on the Zhangjing River and forms a market along the river, known as Main Street. There are hundreds of residents. The Songfeng Highway runs along the back of Main Street north of the river in a right angle. The newly built Songting Highway west of the city also meets at Zhangjing Bridge west of the city. The original road along the Zhangjing River allows boats to be pulled by trackers to Zhangyan. The road east of the city across the City River Bridge leads to Hougang. The roadbed is smooth and no different from a highway. Recently, Japanese troops have been traveling frequently, and the road surface is particularly solid. This time, the enemy troops entered the country and came from this road. Based on the terrain, it is estimated that the enemy landed at Jinshanwei, passed through Ganxiang to Hougang, then entered Songyin, and divided forces from Zhangyan, one heading to Songyin and the other to Zhangze, meeting at Mishidu, which is also geographically logical. The town's institutions include a police station, located on the north side of the river west of the city, near the highway station, the district office, the central school, and Songyin Elementary School, all located south of the river. The telephone bureau is located in the district office. Initially, the number of enemy troops arriving was said to be several thousand, and some said several hundred. Everyone's words differed, but it was known that in addition to occupying public institutions such as the district office and schools, the streets were crowded with people looking for places to rest their feet, so there must have been quite a few who came.

Songyin is said to be the place where the Immortal Chisongzi lived in seclusion, but the land has no mountains or hills and does not resemble it. It is probably a case of interpreting the words literally, coming from the meaning of the two characters Songyin. The residence of Chen Taoyi, the former governor of Jiangsu Province, is located behind Main Street. However, Chen was honest and self-disciplined, and his ancestral residence was never expanded. Compared with today's high-ranking officials and dignitaries returning to their hometowns with brocade robes and building grand mansions and scenic gardens, it is greatly inferior. After Chen retired from office, he still lived on his salary. His wife and sisters-in-law were as before. The villagers also did not recognize it as the home of the governor. This time, when the war broke out, it was heard that because of poverty, he was unable to take his family to the sea to live. Now he is also trapped in enemy territory. An honest official can be done, but it also cannot be done. On the 5th of this month, the situation gradually tightened. At that time, people in the telephone bureau had already fled, so there was no accurate news. The town only had rumors. In the afternoon, I visited District Chief Ding Chongzu (from Taixian, Jiangbei, appointed by the provincial government last year). According to him, Zhangyan seemed to have fallen, but a large force of national troops had arrived in Ganxiang, and the town could be guaranteed to be safe. The police station also had a telephone, but residents had no way of hearing it. The conscript team headquarters was located in the central school. Apart from Captain Cao, who had once summoned the conscripts to speak with words of fighting back if the enemy advanced, but waited until night, the district chief and captain were nowhere to be found. Initially, both the district chief and the captain had more military knowledge, so the district chief in the district warehouse and the captain in the training center both built air raid shelters, which could be used to take refuge when enemy planes came from afar. But this night, the room was empty. People must have been very frightened, but the residents did not know where the enemy was coming from and where to take refuge. Most women and children usually traveled by boat and car and did not know the directions. In addition, there had been continuous heavy rain and the roads were muddy, so there was chaos all night with no good solutions. The tragic situation is difficult to describe in words, but they could only get through each day as it came and sit and wait for slaughter.

On the 6th, it was not yet dawn when I heard the sound of leather shoes on the street. At first, I thought the national troops had arrived and was happy to greet them, but looking closely through the cracks in the door, the military uniforms did not seem to match. I quickly went out the back door and was seized by someone who looked like a military officer when I turned to Main Street. Unable to understand his language, he patted his knee as a gesture. I had no choice but to follow him. Along the way, I saw enemy soldiers saluting him, so this person must have been of high rank. Passing a barber shop with the door half open, he drew the four characters "I want to rest" on the ground with his command knife. The barber shop owner invited him in. After he sat down, the owner asked me if this person was Russian or Japanese. I said he was an "Oriental import." The owner panicked and stuck out his tongue, thinking he was a Russian soldier sent to help us resist the enemy, so he was serving him attentively. I took the opportunity to leave, but was then seized by an enemy plainclothes team. These plainclothes teams all wore dark blue Zhongshan suits with a leather belt around their waists and two pistols hanging on each side. Speaking with a Shandong accent, they used a commanding tone, shouting to lead them to find empty houses and asking about my occupation and origin. I lied that I was passing through here last night and did not know where there were any empty houses, but they still pointed their pistols at me, forcing me to go with them. Walking on the street from west to east, I saw many such plainclothes teams. The large bridge on the Songfeng Road to Zhujing and the Pagoda Bridge on the road to Songjiang both had guards who were very strict in their inspection. Only the Songting Bridge to Tinglin was unguarded, so I decided to escape along this road, but I heard that Tinglin had fallen into enemy hands, so I could not go along the highway. So, I pretended to urinate and took the opportunity to escape through a small alley. I walked three miles to Xizhuangwan, which was originally a desolate village, but now was full of refugees. It was already full. Then I thought that the enemy troops had just arrived and had not yet gone to the countryside, but this place was too close to the town and would be difficult to avoid, so I left after a short rest. I walked four miles to Zhangze and met a passerby who said that everyone in the town had fled and there was no way to ask for directions. So, the two of us went together, picking up the road to the northeast. After another seven miles, I reached Yexie. I rolled in the mud all day and walked about ten miles. Before I knew it, it was already dark.

Yexie had police, prison guards, and conscripts, and they were rushing to build defensive fortifications, but the curfew was early. I stayed overnight. The next day (7th), I took a refugee boat along the Pujiang River and arrived at Minhang in about two hours. The residents of Minhang had also fled. The transportation available was the so-called "wild chicken" small chartered cars. Chartering a car once to send you to Shanghai costs 150 yuan, plus a 2,000 yuan security deposit, or some would scold that they were taking advantage of the fire to loot. But thinking that they were taking great risks, they were also people who valued money more than life. I also paid 20 yuan to book a seat, but after waiting until the afternoon, it did not come out. I was afraid of missing the opportunity, so I had to abandon my right to ride and walked along the highway near Qianliang Temple. I saw an old woman sitting stiffly with her head hanging down in a car. The car body was pierced like a honeycomb. This old woman was obviously killed by shrapnel. I don't know whose wife or mother she was. Her husband and young children were eagerly waiting for her to return. I also saw a destroyed truck, loaded with refugees who had been bombed to death, all looking like roasted chickens. The shocking scene is indescribable. There were even more cars and trucks overturned in the ditches along the road. At times, two enemy planes would take turns strafing and bombing downwards. I saw a car in trouble, but under these circumstances, I was only busy under the trees and in the grass, stumbling with every step, and had no time to watch more. In the evening, I finally arrived at Xujiahui. Thinking back on what I had experienced in the past three days, my heart was still uneasy.

### Our Military and Police Firmly Defend South City, Enemy Violently Attacks Rihui Port This Morning

Twice Attacked Under the Cover of Tanks, Both Times Repelled, Huge Explosion in West Shanghai This Morning Caused by Our Army Destroying Bridges

Songjiang Still in Our Hands as of Now

After our army deployed new positions on the Nanxiang-Qibao line, the enemy has not dared to advance lightly and is busy building fortifications. The front line is relatively quiet. The battles in the suburbs of Songjiang are fierce. As of this afternoon, Songjiang is still in our hands. This reporter observed enemy cavalry patrolling back and forth on the main street of Xujiahui, Jinyi Bridge, Fenglin Bridge, Dapu Bridge and other places this morning. Military transport is very busy. The enemy is rushing to build fortifications in the Damuqiao and Fenglin Bridge areas. The French Concession's waterfront area is heavily guarded by a large number of French troops, prohibiting pedestrians and cutting off traffic. Seven enemy planes circled and scouted across the Dapu Bridge and dropped leaflets. According to eyewitness reports from local residents, at about 6:00 am this morning, the enemy used a regiment of troops, with six tanks as cover, to violently attack our Rihui Port line. Our army responded calmly, and for a while, small cannons and machine guns roared. The enemy was unable to withstand and retreated after about 20 minutes. Then, they used flat-trajectory guns to bombard our coastal positions. Our army ignored them. After 7:00 am, it became quiet again. At about 9:00 am, the enemy used small tanks to cover dozens of infantry and tried to attack again. Our army waited until they were close and fired machine guns, killing or wounding more than ten enemies, who then retreated. It is said that the loud noise at about 4:00 am this morning, which shook the glass windows of residential houses in the western Shanghai area, was caused by our Rihui Port defending army using a large amount of explosives to cut off bridges. Furthermore, according to our military authorities, the loyal military and police who are defending South City are all determined to sacrifice and coexist with the land. If the enemy continues to attack, they will surely shed a huge amount of blood and consume countless ammunition, exchanging this last piece of Shanghai land at the highest price.

### Our Enemy Forces Confront Each Other Across the River at Rihui Port

Enemy Attempts to Attack Twice This Morning, Both Times Unsuccessful

Our army was ordered to defend South City to the death. From the Rihui Port bridgehead west of Rue du Père Robert Dapu Bridge, along Rihui Port to Longhua Road, extremely strong fortifications have been deployed. Our and the enemy armies are confronting each other across the river. At 6:00 am this morning, the enemy used five tanks, covering more than 100 infantry, and rushed from Fenglin Bridge along Xie Xu Road to the Rihui Port bridgehead. The bridge had already been destroyed by our army. Enemy vehicles attempted to cross the river, but were repeatedly machine-gunned by our army, killing countless enemies. The enemy vehicles then retreated. At about 8:00 am, two more enemy vehicles came, followed by more than 30 infantry, who shot at our positions at the bridgehead. Our army immediately counterattacked, and more than ten enemy soldiers fell to the ground. They retreated to behind the broken houses of the Shanghai Rubber Factory. The enemy is rushing to build fortifications in the Huomu Bridge Fenglin Bridge area. Hundreds of enemy troops are extremely busy back and forth in Xujiahui Jinyi Bridge and other places. Six or seven enemy planes circled and scouted over our army this morning and did not leave until noon.

However, our covering troops were still in the Hechen Lane area about 600 meters east of the town. At 9:30 pm last night, an enemy outpost force of about 300 people advanced west along Avenue Petain and encountered our army. Our army immediately adopted an encircling formation and annihilated more than 100 enemies. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy retreated under the cover of tanks.

### Our Fresh Forces Encircle the Mishidu Area

The Central News Agency military reporter reported at 1:00 pm on the 10th that at about 2:00 am this morning, our fresh forces had encircled and annihilated the remaining enemies at Mishidu Ferry and Jinjigang south of Songjiang Station. The enemy was trapped in a heavy encirclement. Although they衝擊 desperately, they were ultimately unable to break out. As of 7:30 am this morning, enemy deaths and injuries had reached 400.

This morning (the 10th), hundreds of enemy troops were sent to patrol and loot in various places. At the same time, many enemy planes, in groups of three or five, flew over the sky above South City and the neighboring French Concession to spy for a long time, but did not drop bombs.

### The Situation in Pudong Remains as Yesterday

The Pudong area is vast, estimated to be a quarter of the size of Shanghai, bordering the three counties of Shangnan and Chuan. It is still being defended by our strong forces. A reporter observed in the morning that civilians from all four rural areas were continuously moving westward along the roads. Brave and loyal police officers stood at key intersections, busily directing traffic with orderly discipline. Two or three enemy planes flew in the sky, constantly conducting reconnaissance. The grinding sound of their engines did not attract the attention of pedestrians. All the shops on the streets remained open for business. Being among them, one did not feel the fear of wartime at all. The reporter lingered with several friends on Pudong Avenue for a long time. Looking into the distance, it felt as though this remaining eastern front battlefield within the overall Shanghai-Songhu battle remained as before, unmoved.

### The Enemy in Yangshupu Opens Fire to Probe

At 5:45 AM on the 10th, enemy troops in the Yangshupu area fired a shot at our army's Pudong positions. The sound reverberated throughout Shanghai, startling citizens awake from their sleep.

### Enemy Hospital Ship Arrives in Shanghai Again This Morning

Enemy planes continue to fly reconnaissance missions.

After unloading dozens of boxes of medicine, it loaded over 1,800 wounded soldiers. This continued until around 12:00 PM without completion and departure. It is reported that this was the 23rd time this ship had come to Shanghai, and the total number of wounded soldiers transported back and forth has reached over 20,000.

### Large Numbers of Enemy Planes Active Everywhere

From 6:00 AM to 9:30 AM today, a total of over 40 enemy planes flew from the enemy air base in the Yangshupu area. Most of them flew towards the western part of Shanghai, while others circled and conducted reconnaissance over various parts of the city. In addition, two enemy seaplanes on the Huangpu River also flew low over the Pudong and Nanshi areas, circling and simulating bombing runs. They finally left at 11:00 AM.

Starting at dawn this morning, three enemy planes flew to the Nanshi riverside area for a long time to reconnoiter. Around 8:00 AM, three more planes flew in from the northeast, circled over the city, and then flew south along Ximen to Gaochang Temple, turning west along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. Then, around 10:00 AM, two enemy planes randomly strafed the riverside docks with machine guns for a quarter of an hour before leaving. Around 11:00 AM, three more planes reconnoitered over Nanshi, and had not been seen returning by noon.

Around 12:00 PM this afternoon, two enemy planes flew to the Nanshi area to reconnoiter for a long time.

### Situation of Enemy Troops Landing in Jinshanwei

Talks with Refugees Escaping from Zhangyan

Repeated Encounters with Military Police Resistance Along the Way; Buying Over Hearts and Minds, Tempting Our Villagers

Recently, someone who had escaped to Shanghai from Zhangyan Town in Jinshan County told a reporter in detail about the enemy's landing in Jinshanwei. The details are recorded as follows:

Gunfire Along the Beach on the Morning of the 5th

The enemy landed in Jinshanwei in the early morning of the 5th, immediately engaging in guerrilla warfare with customs and salt police. At that time, responsible personnel from Jinshanwei, Jinshan Zui, Quan Gong Ting, and Jin Si Niang Bridge were still in telephone contact with Zhangyan, learning that the number of enemy troops landing was only two or three hundred.

Impersonating Fishermen, Spotting the Treachery

When the enemy landed, they impersonated fishermen. The troops landing at Jinshanwei forcibly cut off the clothes worn by the fishermen who were fishing along the coast and put on Japanese uniforms. They were quickly discovered by our military police, but due to the enemy's superior numbers, effective resistance was impossible. Finally, around 7:00 AM that morning, the enemy's advance troops had reached Da Shitou and fled north to Jiao Li An Town. At that time, telephone lines between Zhangyan and Quan Gong Ting were also lost.

Encounters with Military Police Attacks Along the Way

After the enemy reached Jiao Li An, military police near Zhangyan immediately went out to resist. After holding out until noon, enemy troops who had landed at Caojing and those who had landed at Quan Gong Ting also divided into groups of twenty or thirty and advanced along two routes, east and west, towards Zhangyan Town. The troops in Quan Gong Ting seemed to enter Qin Huang Mountain north of Zhangjia Orange, reaching Zhangyan via Hejing Bay. The troops in Caojing seemed to reach Yangxupu via Hequekou to Shanyang Yi Duo Bridge. The residents of the town fled in panic, not knowing what to do.

Gunfire Erupts at One PM

By 1:00 PM in the afternoon, Zhangyan Town was surrounded on all sides by the enemy, and gunfire erupted. The enemy again divided their forces and fled to Songyin. Thousands of refugees also fled in different directions, west to Zhujing and northwest to Xianlai Temple, Zhao Zhi Mishi Ferry, and Yexie.

Resistance Again Encountered in Songyin and Yexie

The enemy encountered resistance from our military police in Songyin and Yexie. This time, the enemy suffered heavier casualties than before. The direction of Mishi Ferry had already been tightly blocked by our army. The troops that divided from Zhangyan and went east to Tinglin joined forces with the Caojing team and went east to Zhuangjiahang, Hui, An Mou, all the way to Nanjiao.

Our Troops Head to Tuolin to Meet and Kill the Enemy

On the night of the 5th and the morning of the 6th, our troops first advanced from ××× to the west of Tuolin, surrounding the enemy. The enemy then dared not go deep. We fled from Zhangyan to Yangxipu and Zhuangjiahang, repeatedly encountering violent enemies along the way, and then swam out of the tiger's mouth. Once, the enemy's bullets had run out, and because the clothes worn by the enemy were the same as those worn by our national army, I mistakenly thought the enemy was a friend. I stepped forward and asked, "Old fellow villager, are there any of our brothers in front to send us out?" The enemy heard that I was Chinese, and although he had no bullets by his side, he still hit me with the butt of his gun. I leaned back and, regardless of life and death, pounced on Xiaobang, luckily escaping death, but my right hand had been hit and my fingers were broken. From this mountain road, I hurried day and night to the headquarters of our ×× army and escaped the tiger's mouth on the morning of the 7th.

### Military Law Enforcement Supervisor of the First War Zone

Concurrently Held by Fan Songfu

[Nanjing] Military Law Enforcement Supervisor of the First War Zone, Mr. Zhang Yinwu, also serves as the Director of Civilian Training, and his affairs are very busy and cannot be taken care of. He has recently been reassigned to concurrently serve as the Army Commander of the Forty-Sixth Army, Fan Songfu (Central News Agency Cable on the 9th).

### Fengxian as Perilous as Eggs on a Pile

Nanhui is in the Same State

The situation in Fengxian is deteriorating day by day. In the western countryside, the enemy has occupied Xinxishi from Tuolin. Their advance troops have progressed to Liuli Dun, two or three miles away from Nanqiao, with the potential to reach Minhang. Although there are no traces of the enemy in the eastern countryside and the Xinchang area of Nanhui, the residents have long since moved away. Local thugs take the opportunity to rob, and few can escape. As for enemy planes bombing, the heaviest loss was in Fengcheng, which has been bombed for three consecutive days since the 5th and has become scorched earth. The casualties are unknown. The principal of the local school, Shen Zhigang, had his head and feet blown off and died on the spot. Nanqiao has long been deserted. All the county government, the Grain Commission, the Security Team headquarters, and various shops such as Dingfeng Jiangyuan and Sida have been burned to the ground. Several fires have also started in Zhuanghang. According to the situation yesterday afternoon, the entire county was on the verge of falling. County Magistrate Yu Xilai was unable to maintain order and had no choice but to retreat to Shanghai. Police Chief Zhou had gone to the front line with the army. Very few of the disaster-stricken people escaped from the eastern countryside, and not many escaped from the western countryside. They have all temporarily taken refuge in the countryside to avoid danger. Of the several thousand refugees who have escaped to Shanghai in recent days, even the wealthy are struggling to escape the disaster. The most tragic of those who have suffered are Ding Zhiyan's wife, children, and more than a dozen people including the Zhuang family mother and daughter, who were completely sacrificed when their car was bombed by enemy planes near Caohejing the day before yesterday. Ding witnessed the tragic scene and immediately drew his gun to commit suicide, but passers-by rushed forward to hold him tightly, encouraging him with righteousness. He sighed and turned away, ignoring everything and rushing to the front line. All the corpses were cremated by the sulfur bombs and could not be collected. There were no less than thirty people who were shot and wounded by enemy machine guns on the Shanghai-Minhang-Hangzhou Road, and the number of those killed in Tuolin and other places is not yet known. According to people who escaped from various towns in the county today, they saw more than three thousand people crying out for passage on the opposite bank of Minhang and in the two ports of Zhagang and Shazhu. Therefore, last night, Shanghai fellow townsmen Cheng Weiyu, Lu Shenguang, He Binyi, Wang Daoming, Lai Xie Jun, Cai Jianfu, Diao Yebai, etc., gathered for a meeting to ask the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association to ask the International Relief Committee to find ways to save them. On the one hand, they are starting to prepare food for the Shanghai population and raise relief funds. Part of it has been agreed with the county magistrate to transfer existing public funds for reserve use, which is currently being rushed. Wang Hongwen, the director of the Education Bureau, has established a liaison office in Shanghai. All incumbent primary school teachers' salaries for October and November will be paid in full, and those in Shanghai can contact nearby for convenience. County Magistrate Yu, for the refugee relief issues, and various local circles, also set up temporary offices. As for the troops in Fengxian, due to strategic changes, they have retreated to the new defense line when the recognizers issue the manuscript, so the wind of looting is even worse than before. It is heard that the situation is the same in Nanhui. According to reports from people who escaped from the port today, Xinchang, Zhoupu, and Datuan suffered huge losses, and the facts have fallen into a state of stagnation.

### Litvinov Leaves Before Meeting British and American Representatives

The Meeting is Currently Awaiting a Reply from Japan; Representatives from Various Countries Are Busy Negotiating

Brussels: The sudden departure of Soviet chief representative Litvinov from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels to return to Moscow is the main topic of discussion among the representatives today. It is widely believed that Mr. Litvinov took this step because some people are pushing to prevent the Soviet Union from joining the small mediation committee that is about to be set up, so he is expressing his opposition by this means. Before the Secretary left, he visited American chief representative Davis and British chief representative Eden. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Bodingkin is still here and will serve as the Soviet chief representative. At the same time, the work of the New Organization Committee to deal with Japan's reply has been temporarily shelved. It is planned to decide how to deal with it after receiving Japan's reply. Today's meeting lasted a very short time. The county will listen to Davis' short declaration and is expected to decide whether the meeting should be extended to the scheduled date or the date when Japan's reply arrives. It is hoped that the reply will arrive by the end of this week. Today is the anniversary of the armistice of the European War, and a banquet will be held in the evening. Davis, Eden, and British Dominion Minister MacDonald will all attend the banquet. In addition to meeting with Litvinov yesterday, Eden also met with Davis, Spaak, and Guo Taiqi.

### Puppet Organization Established in Suiyuan

Princes and Dukes of Various Leagues and Banners Insist on Not Yielding

[Nanjing] After the enemy troops entered Suiyuan, they used their old tricks of coercion and inducement, forcing the various leagues and banners of Ximeng to break away from the central government. Last month, they convened a so-called conference of representatives of the Inner Mongolian Leagues and Banners to establish a puppet organization. However, according to reliable information, among the five departments and thirteen banners belonging to the Ulanqab and Ik Zhao Leagues in Suiyuan, only the princes and dukes of the Siziwang Banner and the Maoming'an Banner of the Ulan League were forced to turn against them. Other departments and banners, such as the Zhonggong Uxin Eotok and Urat, still refused to yield under the threat of a strong enemy. The Hangjin Banner even issued a telegram after the establishment of the puppet organization, expressing its bright attitude of supporting the central government. The general public in Inner Mongolia eagerly hope that the national army will recover the lost land as soon as possible and break away from the Japanese shackles.

### Zhaohe Ship Captain Fang Nianzu Dismissed and Investigated

[Nanjing] When the Zhaohe warship was docked in the Huangpu waters a month ago, enemy planes attempted to bomb it daily. The ship's captain, Fang Nianzu, disobeyed orders and neglected his duties.

### Enemy Planes Bomb Taiyuan Refugees

In the Area of Tongpu Road and Tai Fen Road; Jinpu Road Passenger Cars Also Attacked

Linfen: Taiyuan is preparing for the defense of the city. In order to avoid the destruction of enemy artillery fire, many residents are moving to other places. Since the first day, refugees have been continuously traveling along the Tongpu Road and Tai Fen Road. Enemy planes have been brutally bombing the non-combatant refugees on the way, wantonly. In the Fenhe River bank and Jiexiu station alone, as many as five or six hundred people were brutally slaughtered. According to eyewitnesses, the enemy planes especially bombed and strafed these two places. Corpses were piled up everywhere, and broken limbs and viscera were everywhere. Those who were lucky enough not to be harmed were searching for the remains of relatives, and the cries of grief and the cries for help from the wounded and not dead shook the heavens and the earth. The cruelty of the enemy army has been reduced to nothing more than a beastly act! (Central News Agency Cable on the 9th)

[Xuzhou] Four enemy planes flew along our Su-Wan and Jin-Long roads this morning, bombing the Jinpu southbound train No. 305. Three bombs were dropped by enemy planes south of Nansuzhou, injuring and killing more than a dozen passengers. The passengers on the entire train were indignant and called the enemy inhuman for bombing travelers. The road also telegraphed the Iron Department to report. Unexpectedly, the enemy planes deliberately wreaked havoc on their return journey and dropped two bombs each at Xuzhou Station and Dapu, fortunately without injuring anyone. (Special Telegram on the 9th)

[Jinan] At 9:00 AM this morning, three enemy planes roamed north and south of Luokou Bridge, dropping three bombs each, all of which missed their targets and caused no losses. They were repelled by our anti-aircraft artillery. (Special Telegram on the 10th)

### Trivial Comments

— Xiang

An editorial in the London Times stated that both Germany and Italy fear that Japan will be exhausted by the war, and that China will be disrupted by the war, causing communism to take advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate. This inference is deeply to the point. If Japan is exhausted by the war and loses its ability to contain the Far East, and Germany and Italy are disrupted by the war, communism will inevitably invade. Our country originally did not agree with communism, and opposed and suppressed communism. But now, the enemy is specially creating a communist country for China. Planes are bombing everywhere, and famous cities and towns are turned into ashes. Industry and commerce are unemployed, and scholars and people are displaced. This has increased our hatred of the enemy and created the qualifications for our communist people. Then how can the country not become a communist country? The enemy wants to occupy our huge land, wants to live and work in peace, and illegal rule is probably a dream. Therefore, the anti-Er pact of the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy is more appropriately called a co-construction pact than an anti-communist pact.

### The Points of Certain Victory in the Beijing Conference and Our Diplomacy

— Wu Benzhong

The Chinese people are very concerned about the Beijing Conference, but most are pessimistic and few are optimistic.

If we observe the current situation, it is difficult for this international conference, which was convened based on the Nine-Power Treaty, to give our country "immediate satisfaction." The reason is very clear: the violent Japan is not convinced by "force." "Force" has the distinction between economic power and military power; however, if there is only the former and the latter is not used as a backing, then under the current situation in East Asia and the international situation, it is not only difficult to have a real effect, but also a real idea. If there are no unexpected events, especially strict markets, countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, which are hosting this conference, will definitely not think of lightly moving their weapons, and Japan has no such preparations either. If there is a lack of military force and less restrictions, they will sing the song of "sincerity and peace," hoping that Japan will lay down its butcher knife and immediately become a Buddha: is it easy? This is why the Beijing Conference is extremely difficult to give our country a "current" and "practical" complete victory.

However, if we can look at the past, look forward to the future, and recognize that this international conference is an important stage in our people's anti-war diplomacy, rather than the final gate; we must not stick to temporary satisfaction; we must broaden our horizons, deploy diplomatic lines, and make persistent efforts to achieve a complete victory in the future; then this Beijing Conference has extremely important significance for our country, and also has the points of certain victory that can be obtained; we must pay special attention to it!

㊀ Sir Samuel Hoare, when he was British Foreign Secretary a year ago, deeply considered the actions of Japan in the Far East; he said to his colleagues: "What threatens us is no longer the yellow pot, but the 'Saffron-colored disaster.'" That is, the color of burning sulfur; "We will cause a European war because of the Near East problem, igniting the medicine storehouse; I believe that today's Far East problem can cause a greater fire in the world." "However! It is a pity that the firefighters are not of one mind, do not know how to contact each other, and cooperate with each other!" Indeed, since the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty, it has been fifteen years, and the "fire brigades" - namely the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, etc. - have always had disagreements and stood by and watched whenever they encountered a "major danger," resulting in today's serious situation. The fact that there can be tangible cooperation and the formation of a powerful "firefighting front" should begin with this Beijing Conference. Its arrival period is slightly late, but its trend is favorable to our country, which cannot be denied. We know very well that there may be those who want to "take advantage of the fire to rob" mixed in this team; but we are even happier that a new firefighting warrior - Russia - has joined. Therefore, our country's diplomatic strategy must seize the opportunity of this conference and use diplomatic means to concretely realize this "Far East firefighting front" and build it firmly! ! ! The profound significance of this, and the great relationship with the future of our nation, we have no time to discuss in detail here; our compatriots can also understand it.

㊀ During the Franco-Prussian War, the French great man, Gambetta, refused to accept defeat. He flew out of the siege of Paris by balloon and arrived in Bordeanx in the south to form a government of national salvation to continue the struggle. The greatness of his spirit really opened the foundation for the French renaissance. The place where he himself gained strength was that he had an unbreakable belief. What was his belief? That is, he firmly believed that the grievance of a large nation must eventually be redressed, and that "justice" is eternal. We, the survivors of China, have suffered injustice for a hundred years. After hearing these wise words, after weeping bitterly, we should have a sacred belief, that is, believe that the day when our 400 million compatriots are redressed is not far away. The Beijing Conference is based on the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on the sixth of last month, the report of the twenty-three-nation Advisory Committee, and the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, the Paris Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, then our diplomatic foothold is extremely stable, and legally and justly, we have become an invincible force. If we hold on to this point and do not leave the altar, we can apply it infinitely. May I ask, if we do not despair, who else can be ashamed to clearly violate the basic covenant of convening the conference and propose to me the conditions of not "respecting China's sovereignty and independence, as well as the integrity of its territory and administration," "keeping promises is the only maintenance requirement for slightly organized crowds since the beginning of the wilderness. If the market is set up between Japan and China and midnight has not arrived, then the seeds of human civilization will be destroyed and return to the world of weeds. If deerskin is promised and a dog's tail is given, even barbarians have no way of trading. The reason why international law has the principle of Pacta sunt Servanda (a Latin idiom, the translated meaning can be: when a covenant is established, the obligation follows) is that it is the meaning of observing the covenant, precisely because human evolution has reached the point where the international community has mutual order. If many dignified and solemn covenants are allowed to be equal to broken paper, then not only will the international community have nothing to maintain and become a strongman universe, but the whole world can also regress to the era of eating raw meat and drinking blood! How can civilization be so! One justice and one international faith are not China's private affairs, but the public treasures of countries around the world. We ascend to the world's diplomatic stage to call for the soul of justice. Who can stop it, who can bend it, cannot stop it, cannot bend it, this is the point of our diplomatic victory, which must never be relaxed. (Draft on the opening day of the Beijing Conference (

### Shanghai South Refugees Fleeing to the Concessions

Tens of Thousands Crowding at Old North Gate and Nanyang Bridge; Xie Bridge Iron Gate Already Closed

Since the implementation of the refugee zone in the Nanshi area within the city began on the 9th, the Red Cross flag of the International Relief Committee has been flying in the wind at places like Old North Gate and Minkuo Road. Local shops reopened for business yesterday. However, today, due to the influx of refugees from areas such as Rihui Port, Fenglin Bridge, and Xietu Road, resembling swarms of ants, shops on Minkuo Road and other places closed again today. The iron gate at the Old North Gate leading to the concession saw refugees pouring in like a tide. The French Concession authorities specially dispatched Chinese and French police, as well as detectives, to stand inside and outside the iron fence, doing their best to maintain order so that refugees could pass through shoulder to shoulder in an orderly manner. Those carrying cages, boxes, and packages were prohibited from entering the concession, and those with suspicious behavior were subjected to inspection. The reporter then went to Nanyang Bridge for inspection, where the crowded and chaotic situation at the iron gate leading to the concession was no less severe than at the Old North Gate. It is said that the iron gate at Xie Bridge has been closed due to the situation, so the actual passages from Nanshi to the concessions have been reduced to the above two places.

Further news reports that after our army withdrew from western Shanghai, a portion of the troops continued to defend Nanshi, confronting the enemy across Rihui Port. From dawn today, enemy planes flew over Nanshi for reconnaissance and indiscriminate bombing. Although the refugee zone in the Nanshi area is still relatively stable, the number of residents south of the refugee zone is still very large, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands. Starting from the 9th, they have been rushing to the French Concession for refuge. This morning, even more people sought refuge. At the iron gate entrances of Nanyang Bridge and Old North Gate, the crowds waiting to enter the concession were enormous and extremely congested. The French authorities will stipulate that the Nanyang Bridge direction will only allow exiting the concession and refuse entry, while the Old North Gate direction will remain open as usual. Therefore, in the Old North Gate area, one sees tens of thousands of heads crowded together, surging like a tide. According to those who escaped from Xietu Road, after the enemy troops advanced into the sections west of Rihui Port, they set fires, killed people, and searched for refugees everywhere. Most of the young people were killed with bayonets, while the elderly, weak, women, and children were able to survive, but the cash they had with them was taken away by the Japanese soldiers.

Further news reports that after the movement of our army's front lines, residents of Nanshi, due to numerous rumors, are moving to the concessions. I went to Minkuo Road, Zhonghua Road, Xiaodongmen and other places for inspection. Only Old North Gate Road is passable at the intersection of the Chinese and French concessions. On Minkuo Road and Zhonghua Road, moving vehicles followed one another closely, which were quite crowded. The military police authorities of the French Concession dispatched a large number of constables to maintain order at the iron gate. Other general conditions were still good. Shops were mostly half-open for business, and the street vendors were especially sparse. The residents' attitude was very calm, and the police authorities were particularly competent in maintaining law and order.

### Chamber of Commerce Raises Funds to Comfort Troops in the North

Already Collected 31,100 Yuan

### Severe Punishment for Taking the Opportunity to Raise Rice Prices

Selling Price Must Not Exceed 14 Yuan

The Municipal Rice Merchants Association believes that the relationship with local people's food is important during this extraordinary period. Since the end of the People's Food Regulation Association, some rice merchants have taken the opportunity to raise rice prices. It was specially convened an emergency meeting to decide that the selling price of the same industry should comply with the regulations of the People's Food Association and should not exceed 14 yuan per dan to maintain the people's food. It was specially notified to all rice shops to comply with it, together with the Bean and Rice Industry Association. Dear Sirs, in this extraordinary period, local people's food is of the utmost importance. The market price of all rice and grain should still comply with the regulations of the former People's Food Regulation Association, and the selling price should not exceed 14 yuan per dan. All rice shops in the city, whether buying or selling, should comply with it. It is hoped that cargo merchants can understand this intention. If there is any overstepping, once discovered and verified, it will be reported to the local authorities for severe punishment. Fortunately, all industries pay close attention, so this notice is issued.

### Public Concession Holds Winter Defense

Increase Police Force and Dispatch Constables to Patrol Strictly

The Public Concession Police Department believes that since the Shanghai War, the number of people in the boundary has greatly increased, and it is inevitable that good and bad are mixed. Moreover, theft cases have occurred frequently recently, and winter is approaching. It is deeply feared that thieves and bandits will take the opportunity to act, so winter defense is specially carried out. In addition to increasing the police force, each police station will send a number of armed Chinese and Indian constables, wearing steel armor, to patrol on the roads. If there are any suspicious persons, they will be stopped and searched. After this strict inspection and precaution, the bandits will be afraid, and the people will be safe.

### Three Industry Associations Request Extension of

Registration Period for Japanese Goods

The Municipal Yarn Industry, Instruments and Stationery Industry, and Iron Industry Associations believe that the deadline for registering Japanese goods is seven days. Now, because many of the responsible persons have left Shanghai, or the types are too numerous to handle, or they are stored in various places, making it inconvenient to go back and forth for inspection, they have all sent letters requesting the National Committee for Economic Severance from Japan to extend the registration deadline for one week to facilitate handling.

### Reject Peace

— Lin Jianxing

Our leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, once told a French reporter in Nanjing: "Our country's war of resistance this time is not only for its own harm, but also for the justice of the whole world. If the Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Peace Pact are allowed to be torn up by Japan, the foundation of world peace will inevitably be shaken. We must continue to fight until justice is completely victorious." This fully declares our position on the War of Resistance.

The enemy's repeated aggressions have always been carried out by means of fighting and negotiating peace at the same time. In the past, we lost many territories or sovereignty, almost all because of this trick. On the one hand, they were conducting military operations, and on the other hand, they were conducting peace negotiations, using political division to help military occupation. As a result, we could only watch helplessly as they were slaughtered. At the beginning of the Lugou Bridge Incident, they performed this good show again. Sure enough, Song Zheyuan fell for their old trick again and lost Pingjin.

Since the start of the all-out War of Resistance, the vast majority of our people, except for a very few who were complacent and still hoped and longed for peace, have followed the government in embracing the determination to resist the war. We will never be tired of war, even if the war is extended to ten years or even a year. However, our lack of war-weariness is by no means "war-mongering," because our war is for justice, for righteousness, and for lasting world peace, which is completely different from the aggressive warlords of the invading country.

In recent days, I have heard that the enemy in Shanghai is eager for a truce, and at the same time, many traitors have secretly come to Shanghai from North China to promote peace. "Peace" is such a good-sounding word, who doesn't long for peace? Moreover, the Chinese nation is the most peace-loving, but because it loves peace so much, it does not hesitate to be fooled by everyone repeatedly. This call for peace makes me suspect that the enemy is using his consistent old trick again. To put it bluntly, we will never be hooked this time.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said: "Once the War of Resistance is launched, there will be no compromise halfway." It is of course possible for the enemy to want peace, but we don't want false peace, peace for a time and a place, but real peace, and lasting world peace.

As long as we have a piece of territory occupied by the enemy, or even an inch of territory occupied by the enemy, and as long as we have some sovereignty in the hands of the enemy, we will not talk about peace. We will resist the war to the end. "Resistance is the mother of peace, and only resistance can produce true peace and lasting world peace."

"Advocates of peace are traitors," this is the slogan we used when we held the Great Shanghai Defense Movement. We are not absolutely refusing the enemy's acknowledgement of peace, because we can no longer fall into the enemy's trap. Therefore, the peace we need must be built on the principle of "independence and integrity of territory and sovereignty."

As long as we have an inch of territory under the enemy's iron hooves, and as long as we have some of our sovereignty in the hands of the enemy, this is not considered independence and integrity, and we will never talk about peace with the enemy.
