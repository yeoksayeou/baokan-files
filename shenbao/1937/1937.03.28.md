### Boundary Survey Committee on Yunnan-Burma Border Denies Reports of Suppressing Wild Hai People

The Bandit Attack Killed a Groom, Guards Chase and Kill or Wound Several People

[Nanjing] Recently, various Chinese and Western newspapers in Yunnan and Shanghai have successively published news about the Chinese members of the Boundary Survey Committee suppressing the Wild Hai people. A reporter recently spoke with Mr. Li Yaochen, who previously served as a staff member of our office in the Boundary Survey Committee and has returned to Shanghai for personal reasons. According to Mr. Li Yaochen, the news is completely untrue and is obviously someone deliberately spreading rumors to mislead the public. The following is a brief account of the situation I witnessed at the time. On December 24 last year, our committee members led soldiers and passed through the jungle outside the Wild Hai village. Jin Dechang, the groom of Mr. Kuang Heng, was pulling a horse slightly behind. Bandits lurking in the forest suddenly attacked, splitting his head with a knife and cutting open his abdomen, robbing him and fleeing. The guards rushed to the scene upon hearing the sound, but the groom was already dead. The guard captain immediately ordered the pursuit of the bandits. They caught up with them in front of the village, killing two criminals and wounding several members of the bandit gang. The matter was then settled. Our soldiers suffered no casualties. On that day, our side used more than 50 bullets, and no machine guns were fired. I saw all the circumstances at the time, and I am confident that what I saw was correct. The rumors that the battle in Wild Hai was fierce and that machine guns and bullets were consumed in large quantities do not correspond to the facts. Moreover, arresting three or four bandits cannot be called a battle at all. I camped with our committee members on the banks of the Dongjiang River for three days and talked with the local natives. The following is a summary of what I heard. The Wild Hai exchange goods and trade with the Mengyun and other villages year-round. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the rebellions in Wild Hai were all suppressed by Madam Ding and Madam Peng leading troops, and they were still assigned to Mengyun. Therefore, the land and people of Wild Hai have always been under our rule, and there is no such thing as surrendering. Another newspaper also reported that when the natives listened to the gramophone, they said that they had never seen such a thing before we were under the administration of Han officials, which is even more absurd. Before Ding and Peng put down the rebellion, Wild Hai was once under the jurisdiction of Shun Ning, and later under the Zhenbian Sub-Prefecture. Recently, it was assigned to the Cangyuan Governing Bureau. Places such as Shaoxing and Shaoba (now called Shaoxing) near Kunda were also recorded in the Shun Ning Prefecture. Therefore, it may be possible that scholars had not heard of the gramophone before, but it is completely wrong to say that they had not been under the administration of Han officials. The word "Wild Hai" is a translation of the local sound and has no meaning of barbarism. The natives in that area all wear Han clothes and know a little Chinese. They are by no means uncivilized. What Mr. Li said is a responsible statement and cannot be compared to hearsay. It is specially disclosed to reveal the truth. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### King of the Polish Gypsies Assassinated

[Paris] The Petit Parisien recently carried a dispatch from Warsaw, saying that Baron Fock, the King of the Polish Gypsies, was recently shot and died of serious injuries in a Warsaw hospital yesterday morning. The Gypsies are a nomadic people in Central Europe who live by performing and their footprints are all over Europe. Although the clan has no territory, there is a king. The king's name is Fock, known as a baron. The Gypsies in Poland are controlled by him. Recently, his prestige has spread to the Gypsies in Romania, so he is quite jealous. A Gypsy named Matthew also claimed to be the King of the Gypsies in Europe, wanting to compete with Fock for orthodoxy. Six months ago, Matthew met Fock in a small city in Poland. The two held a duel, and Matthew was finally injured by Fock, so Fock's rule was maintained. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, Fock and several of his "ministers" were holding a meeting in a small hotel near Warsaw, when a thug suddenly opened fire, causing him to be injured. He was then taken to the hospital for treatment, but eventually died of his injuries. The reason for the shooting is still unknown. According to Fock's close attendants, it was because Matthew had the intention of "usurping the throne", so he sent someone to assassinate him, but the police authorities have not yet been able to confirm this statement.

French Correspondence

### The White-Hot German-French Arms Race (II)

— Xiaoke

Hitler's extreme arms race is making the domestic economy increasingly panicked, and the people's lives are becoming more and more impoverished. Key members of the Nazi Party have repeatedly declared, encouraging the people to sacrifice meat and butter and save money to make military equipment. The one-dish-per-meal system is now being implemented in government offices. (Metals necessary for military industry, such as copper, nickel, zinc, and tin, are no longer allowed to be used for decoration. Sixty percent of Germany's domestic industry is used to manufacture military supplies.) Neighboring countries feel more and more chilling about it, so French Prime Minister Léon Blum once declared to foreign reporters: "If Hitler realizes that the arms race is not a good policy, only making the arms race of countries around the world white-hot, and the national finances fall into a desperate situation, and agrees to a universal disarmament, then France is willing to provide Germany with economic and material assistance..." Although the French Prime Minister's hope is like this, it is feared that Hitler is in a difficult position to stop, so the French Popular Front government has to expand its armaments. In addition to deciding to recruit professional soldiers (now increased to 144,000), improving the efficiency of armaments, further mechanizing the army, extending the Maginot Line, connecting the northern front with the Belgian front, and extending the southern front to the Swiss border. It also decided to expand the naval program on a large scale. In addition to the two 35,000-ton battleships decided to be built in 1935, five 35,000-ton battleship armored ships and two 15,000-ton aircraft carriers will be built in six years (to be completed by 1943) (According to Germany is building 19,250 tons, and the maximum tonnage allowed by last year's London Naval Conference is 23,000 tons, so the tonnage of these two ships may still be changed.) Ten 8,000-ton light cruisers, as well as destroyers and submarines, totaling 39 ships, with a total tonnage of 273,000 tons. Due to the construction of new warships, naval personnel have to increase by 4,000 people. This plan will be requested by the Minister of the Navy, Dibek, to the parliament for permission. The implementation of the above plan will require an estimated expenditure of 127 billion francs, which will increase the national budget expenditure by more than 20 billion francs per year on average. This is equivalent to France adding seven major giant ships in six years. France's existing shipbuilding industry is insufficient, so new shipyards will be built and workers will be added, so as to complete the naval shipbuilding plan in the shortest possible time.

In terms of the air force, the Minister of Aviation, General Ternay, had requested the parliament to approve the reorganization of the air force in 1934, and a special budget of 26.95 billion francs was used to replace the 1923-1925 aircraft with new ones to increase their speed, flight capacity, and carrying capacity, so as to compete with the air forces of the major powers. However, the mission of the French Air Force is defense rather than attack. At that time, General Ternay, in view of the possibility of the outbreak of international war sooner or later, ordered the mass production of the prototype aircraft that had achieved results and set a time limit for delivery. In less than 18 months, in November 1935, the French Air Force had been successfully reorganized and could compete with foreign air forces. Unexpectedly, international disputes have become more and more profound in the past year, and the arms race has become white-hot. Therefore, the French Air Force will be expanded again. (The French Air Force Staff Headquarters obtained a very good experimental opportunity in the Spanish Civil War. In August and September, it extracted dozens of the latest prototype military aircraft, such as Potez Bloch zic and Italian Fiat Savoia·Machcttis 8i German Junker 52, Heinkel fighters, and thus learned the advantages and disadvantages of its air force material prototype aircraft.)

The 1937 expenditure budget has been prepared by the Finance Minister of the People's Front government, Uliol, and has been approved by the two houses. From this budget, we can see the sharp increase in his military spending, which has never been seen in previous budgets. Now I will describe them separately as follows:

The ordinary budget for national defense and the army in 1937 is 5,864,509,695 francs (of which 1,374,968,785 francs are for overseas territorial defense), while the ordinary budget for 1936 is 4,370,830,160 francs (of which 1,062,9,16,090 francs are for overseas territorial defense). The military expenditure in this year increased by 1,493,679,535 francs compared with the previous year. The special budget for national defense in 1937 is 4,222,345,880 francs. The total expenditure of ordinary and special national defense expenditures is 10,086,855,575 francs. ) (The budget for national police under the Ministry of the Interior is not included)

The air force military budget is 129,949,773 francs for recurring expenses, while last year it was 900,000,000 francs. The special expenditure for military equipment is 2,500,000,000 francs, while last year it was 1,500,000,000 francs. It is estimated that the total expenditure for recurring and special items increased by 1,300,000,000 francs. Another 200,000,000 francs will be used to acquire state-owned aircraft manufacturing plants (four state-owned aircraft companies have now been formed and distributed in four locations). Another 50 million francs will be used to develop the civil aviation industry. (The purpose is to cultivate driving talents for air force replenishment)

The naval budget is 1,811,349,180 francs for recurring expenses and 2,650,086,638 francs for special expenses.

The total special expenditure for national defense is 9,502,796,558 francs.

Therefore, Léon Blum expressed that the arms race has led to national economic bankruptcy. France's increase in military expenditure is purely defensive in nature, and it will continue to adhere to the People's Front's political program. Whenever there is an opportunity, it will propose to all countries to carry out universal disarmament to maintain world peace.

This is the international trend shown to us at the beginning of 1937, and the state of France's military expansion to deal with Germany's craze for armaments. (End)

### Cultivating National Creativity

— Li Anzhai

Anything, only when its existence is in danger, then feels its need. Fish live in water, but don't feel the water; only when the water is about to dry up, do they feel the need for water. People live in culture, but don't feel the culture; only when culture undergoes drastic changes, do they want to understand the reason for culture. The evolving trends of ancient and modern China and foreign countries collide and interact, and the national interest has been harmed for a long time. The civilized system is not enough to innovate and adapt to the function, so we suddenly realize the importance of the national revival movement, and explore the maintenance and selection between the national essence and Western culture.

Nations that have suffered repeated failures are prone to lose their vigor and suspect the aging of the nation. However, the nation cannot be compared with the individual. Individuals age, but there is no such thing as aging in the nation. Anthropology has already shown us: the superiority of a nation lies not in the race, but in the culture.

Culture is man-made, but the reason why man is man is because of culture. From the point of view of man-made culture, man is the master and culture is the tool; from the point of view of man being man because of culture, culture is the model, and man is the specimen cast by the model. What kind of patterns the model has, the specimen also has what kind of patterns. However, this specimen has its own subjectivity. Once it has cultivated various patterns, it will definitely think that it is its own thing: this thing, "the three armies can take away the commander, but the commoner cannot take away the will," is the human nature itself, and also the way in which knowledge, emotion, and intention are spontaneously mobilized.

Therefore, what ordinary people consider to be national problems are all cultural problems, or how to use culture, and how to create culture. So to revive the nation, in the final analysis, is what kind of culture is needed, and how to use culture, and how to create culture.

Regarding what kind of culture, from the saying of Chinese learning as the essence and Western learning for practical use to the present, there is still no solution; we cannot hope to explain it clearly here, and that is not the theme here. Here we can only say that the essence of Chinese learning can never get the use of Western learning, and to get the use of Western learning, one must cultivate the essence of Western learning. More clearly, a handicraft feudal society or a colonial society can never obtain the use of a machine industrial capitalist society; to obtain the use of machine industry, we must break away from the existence of colonial feudal society and obtain an independent status and enter a capitalist society or a higher stage. In this struggle. What we take from the West is science, not system. Scientific methods and technologies and the spirit of science can all be learned, and there is no harm in learning them. The system is what we need to adapt to the situation in time and place, that is, to add creations: it is not possible to learn, and there will definitely be no benefit in learning it. Adapting to the situation in time and place is based on the interests of our nation and country.

Speaking of this, it seems to have answered what kind of culture we want, how to use culture, and involves how to create culture.

The history of the Chinese nation has many great deeds of creation - whether in academics or in career achievements. These great deeds not only make us admire the martyrs and be proud of ourselves, but also are recognized by the world.

However, "a hero does not boast of his bravery in the past", we have had great achievements in the past, why are we now dwarfed in comparison? If we answer this question, we will understand the way to deal with ourselves.

Leaving aside other aspects, just in terms of academics, I am afraid that everyone will admit that the crux of the problem lies in the habit of "eight-legged essays". Because it is an eight-legged essay, it attaches importance to the authority of the sages, and does not attach importance to the right and wrong of the matter. Because it is an eight-legged essay, it does not ask how the ancient sages and sages should deal with it in today's world, but only asks how the scriptures show it. Going down, no matter what the original meaning of the scriptures is, only the traditional annotations are cared about; no matter what the language refers to, what it is used for, only language for language's sake, and words for words' sake are cared about. Since the purpose is to "speak for the sages," therefore words are words, and actions are actions: there is no relationship between words and actions, and there is no need to ask whether words are feasible, or whether actions can be spoken of.

That was the habit of eight-legged essays in the imperial examination era. After the imperial examination, the academic habit of removing the name of the eight-legged essay but retaining the reality of the eight-legged essay is still the same. The only difference is that foreign sages have been added to the Chinese sages, and foreign classics have been added to the Chinese classics: there were originally disputes between Confucian and non-Confucian scholars, and now there are several foreign schools and foreign sects. Therefore, except for a small number of natural sciences, the entire social sciences are still in the era of enslaving foreigners and quoting scriptures.

Ordinary people only see that there is no common opinion in the academic circles, so they simply despise academics and do not investigate the reasons why academics have no power. They refuse to read books and oppose reading, and they are afraid of using thought and despise thought. This kind of mentality is enough to make people lucky and speculative: not to mention that academics itself is not on the right track, it will also promote the process of the nation's creativity falling into decline.

Only by learning can there be techniques, and the process of learning is based on direct experience. With direct experience, and then referring to the experience of others recorded in the classics, indirect experience, can we integrate and understand, and really gain something; with indirect experience to prepare for direct experience, naturally we can do more with less effort because we take fewer detours. The knowledge that cultivates direct experience is true knowledge, and the knowledge that comes only from classics or hearsay is just blind obedience. The former is the footnote of "knowing is difficult, but doing is easy", and the latter is the basis of "doing is difficult, but knowing is easy". Because of blind obedience, we can only plagiarize; because of true knowledge, the creation of opening things and achieving tasks is not difficult to realize.

The reason why true knowledge can create is that direct experience is based on concrete things and their relationships. For example, when learning geography, first understand the location, population, climate, soil, customs, habits, production, transportation, distribution, amusement and other systems of the place; then from near to far, from town to county, to province, to country, to the world, it is intimate, open-minded, and does not fall into the empty. For example, when learning history, first understand one's own situation, and then trace back to the ancestors and clans from which one comes, from the separation of clans to the entire nation's entrusted politics, society, economy, thought, technology and other general history; and then return to use the perspective of world history and national history to estimate the historical stage and significance of one's own situation: in this way, it is impossible to not love the country, and it is even more impossible to shut oneself off and be conceited. This is just an example, but may I ask whether our history and geography and other subjects are taught in this way? We are concerned about the debate over the size of the place and ignore the streets that are used all year round, and we are concerned about the inference of human unity or plurality and forget the boundaries of power between ourselves and others in daily life. These are all the legacy of Chinese and Western "eight-legged essays"!

Direct experience and indirect experience both take time to obtain, so let us pay attention to direct experience. The first-class books and the books that are copied from each other both take effort to read, so let us read the first-class books. Serious knowledge, emotion, and intention and floating reveries both occupy the psychological process when they are used, so let us seriously use our minds. Grasping ourselves and the national interests entrusted to ourselves, that is, striving and knowing, recognizing and achieving new fighting skills and theories at the same time, letting go far and standing firm, we are not worried that our creativity will not be liberated or cultivated!

Taking social sciences as an example, the so-called letting go far is to understand the objective facts of the distribution and evolution of world culture and delineate the longitude and latitude lines of one's own culture; the so-called standing firm is to study one's own cultural area intimately and interestingly, and analyze the various relationships of cause and effect in one's own evolutionary process. Using such practical research to correct the long-standing habits of eight-legged essays, and using the results of field research as the basis for various facilities in the country and the locality and the foundation for scientific systems such as economy, politics, and society, if it is said that career achievements are not quick to achieve, and academics do not make rapid progress, there must be no such reason in the world!

Abolishing classical Chinese and advocating the national language is just a convenience in the means of learning. It must be to eradicate the long-standing habits of eight-legged essays and get on the broad road of field research to be considered to have taken the right direction in academics. If the direction is right, it will definitely be reached sooner or later; if the direction is wrong, the faster it is, the farther it will be from what is being cultivated. Our nation is not aging, it is just that a one-sided culture has gone in the wrong direction. "It is still possible to catch up", please everyone work hard on field research to launch our inherent creative spirit!

### Japan Refuses to Participate in Agreement to Limit Gun Caliber

Officially Submits Reply to Britain, Insisting on Equal Emphasis on Quality and Quantity

[Tokyo] Since December of last year, the British government has been strongly urging Japan to participate in the agreement to limit the caliber of guns on battleships. The Japanese side, after deliberation by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy, decided on its response. Foreign Minister Sato invited British Ambassador to Japan Clive to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon and personally handed him a written reply. The content is as follows: The Japanese government has clarified its views at the London Naval Conference and cannot accept qualitative restrictions without quantitative limitations. Japan's stance remains unchanged, so it cannot agree to the British government's proposed agreement to limit the caliber of guns on battleships without quantitative limitations. (27th, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] Japan's official response to the British government, disagreeing with the limitation on battleship gun caliber, is based on the Navy's general intentions, as follows:

㊀ At the 1935 Naval Disarmament Conference, the Empire proposed a quantitative disarmament plan based on the principle of non-threatening and non-aggressive, but it was not accepted by Britain, the United States, and other countries, leading to withdrawal from the conference. This is well known to all countries in the world. After Japan withdrew, Britain, the United States, and France signed the New London Treaty. Now, Britain hopes Japan will agree to the clause limiting the caliber of guns on battleships, which is Article 4, Section 2 of the New Treaty. It places its emphasis on qualitative limitations, which can be said to be the most important aspect of the New Treaty.
㊁ Japan, having clearly stated its non-participation in the New Treaty, naturally cannot accept this clause. This goes without saying.
㊂ However, Britain's repeated request for Japan to respond to this clause is clearly an attempt to shift the responsibility for instigating naval construction competition onto others. It is a clever and cunning diplomatic strategy to justify its own arms expansion.
㊃ The New Treaty, without quantitative limitations, leaves naval strength as a matter of quantity. Superiority or inferiority is clearly determined by the level of military strength. Limiting only the quality will not prevent naval construction competition. In past history, naval competition from the 16th century, such as the Anglo-German naval construction race before World War I and the Anglo-American naval construction race before the Washington Naval Treaty, is clear evidence.
㊄ From the outset, arms limitation must fundamentally involve quantitative restrictions. Qualitative restrictions are secondary and only effective alongside quantitative restrictions. Therefore, the Empire absolutely cannot express approval of the New London Treaty (which, of course, includes the clause on limiting gun caliber). (27th, Domei News Agency)

### Japanese House of Representatives Passes Supplementary Budget

55 Million Yen

[Tokyo] This afternoon, the House of Representatives passed a supplementary budget案 of 55 million yen. The bill has now been sent to the House of Peers. It is expected to pass along with the budget on Monday. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters)

### Japan's Adjustment of Relations with China Premised on Economic Cooperation

Opposes Disrupting the Status Quo in North China, Moving Forward Based on Established Policy

[Tokyo] Based on recent information, the Chinese side has misunderstood Foreign Minister Sato's speech in the Diet as a sign of Japan's concession and compromise, leading to a hardening of public opinion. They claim that the abolition of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and the abolition of extraterritoriality will be handled unilaterally. This trend seems to make it difficult to achieve the smooth and friendly relations that the Foreign Minister hoped for. Therefore, the Imperial government cannot help but regret China's lack of understanding. In particular, the discussion of abolishing the Shanghai and Tanggu Truce Agreements is even more out of touch with the current situation. The objective circumstances at the time of signing these agreements have not changed today. China lacks recognition of the status quo and is making unreasonable demands. If the Chinese side misunderstands the Foreign Minister's speech and openly declares the unilateral abolition of extraterritoriality, the mistakes of the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China will be repeated today, which China should not do. Japan maintains this calm attitude. Regarding the economic survey mission that has been dispatched, the Chinese side claims that economic problems cannot be solved without solving political problems. This seems reasonable, but where is the boundary between economic and political issues? Their relationship is extremely subtle. Therefore, the Imperial government still adheres to its established policy of prioritizing economic cooperation. It will soon begin negotiations on this Japan-China economic cooperation with the relevant ministries, based on a unified approach. From the perspective of stabilizing the overall situation in East Asia, Japan's attitude is firm and unwavering. Reckless actions should not be allowed to disrupt the lasting stability of East Asia. It will urge the Chinese side to reflect on this. (26th, Domei News Agency)

### Mr. Fujiyama Discusses Impressions of Visiting China

Believes Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation is Possible

[Tokyo] Before leaving Shanghai to return to Japan, Fujiyama Aiichiro, President of the Japan Sugar Manufacturing Company, expressed his personal impressions of his visit to China to a special correspondent of the Nichinichi Shimbun, saying that all influential figures in China believe that "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is impossible unless political problems between the two countries are resolved." This opinion is very strong. However, the atmosphere in China of hoping to cooperate with Japan is actually stronger than the hope of cooperating with any other country. China especially hopes that Japan will assist in its economic plans. If the pending political issues between China and Japan can be resolved, Sino-Japanese ties or Japanese aid to China can be completed under more favorable conditions than with European and American countries. Currently, the expansion of British economic power in China, especially in South China, is truly astonishing, but there is still ample room for Japanese development. Before proceeding with Sino-Japanese economic ties, we should first consider how to enhance China's ability to build a modern nation, develop its industries, and increase its purchasing power. If this can be achieved, economic cooperation between the two countries can be realized. The development of the Chinese economy will ultimately follow the path of an agricultural country in the long run. Although the construction of some industries can be completed, the main economic forces between China and Japan will not conflict, and the two countries can still seek joint development. What we are doing now is of great significance in laying the foundation for future activities. (Central News Agency, 27th)

### Exchange of Ratification Documents: New Italian-Yugoslav Agreement Takes Effect

Italian Foreign Minister Flies Back to Rome, Youth in Yugoslav Capital Demonstrate Against Italy

⊙ Capital of Yugoslavia The political and economic agreements signed between Italy and Yugoslavia were exchanged this morning by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović in the Foreign Ministry here, with effect from today. Ciano then immediately departed from the nearby Remon airfield for Rome. Responsible officials here have stated that the new agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia is of great benefit to peace throughout Europe. As for external speculation that this agreement will enable Yugoslavia to join the Rome-Berlin Axis and will diminish the effectiveness of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente, these are not impartial arguments. Former Yugoslav Prime Minister Pašić decided to approach Italy in 1924 and made this a national policy. This policy was later interrupted for a long time, but Yugoslavia's desire for peace has not diminished. What Prime Minister Stojadinović is doing now is merely restoring Pašić's national policy. After the conclusion of the Italian-Yugoslav agreement, Yugoslavia's allies no longer need to worry about conflicts arising in the Adriatic Sea. Moreover, the economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia will enable the Little Entente countries and the three countries participating in the Rome Protocols (Italy, Austria, and Hungary) to cooperate economically, so this move is beneficial and harmless. This is the opinion expressed by responsible parties. As for general public opinion, most people approve of the Italian-Yugoslav agreement, but some people's opposition to Italy is deeply rooted and not easily changed, as evidenced by the anti-Italian demonstrations last night. (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas)

⊙ Capital of Yugoslavia After the political and economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia was signed yesterday, Italian King Victor Emmanuel III and Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul exchanged telegrams to congratulate each other.

### Different Reactions in Various Countries to the Conclusion of the Italian-Yugoslav Agreement

Britain Satisfied, France Expresses Doubts

Britain [London] After the conclusion of the political and economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia, most people here are very satisfied. The Daily Telegraph recently reported that the situation in Central Europe can be eased as a result, and mutual relations between Italy and Yugoslavia can be improved. "The reconciliation between Italy and Yugoslavia is beneficial to peace in the Mediterranean, and thus the main goal of the previous Mediterranean Agreement between Britain and Italy can also be completed. This is a cause for celebration." In addition, correspondents from British newspapers stationed in various Central European countries have stated that the agreement is not welcomed in Yugoslavia. For example, the Morning Post's correspondent in the Yugoslav capital stated that there are three reasons for this: ㊀ Yugoslavia recognizes the current situation in Albania; ㊁ Yugoslavia recognizes Italy's annexation of Abyssinia; ㊂ The Italian-Yugoslav agreement is a betrayal of the collective security system presided over by the League of Nations, Yugoslavia's allies (Britain and France), the Little Entente, and the Balkan Entente, and is therefore met with dissatisfaction. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas)

France [Paris] Political figures here have expressed a positive reaction after hearing that Italy and Yugoslavia signed a political and economic agreement yesterday, as French foreign policy has always supported closer ties between Italy and Yugoslavia. They believe that this new agreement confers many substantial benefits on Yugoslavia, such as guaranteeing the integrity of the country's land and sea borders. Italy has also abandoned its claims to the Dalmatian coast and other Yugoslav territories. All of this is beneficial to Yugoslavia. Moreover, this new agreement does not undermine the Little Entente Treaty. Although the political agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia stipulates that the two countries should consult each other in the event of international disputes, it does not have automatic or mechanical application. In addition, Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović declared to the press yesterday that this treaty will not diminish Yugoslavia's various alliances and friendly relations with other countries that it has historically entered into. Czech President Beneš will visit Yugoslavia next month, and discussions will be held to ensure that the new Italian-Yugoslav agreement is compatible with Yugoslavia's obligations under the Little Entente Treaty. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas)

[Paris] The newspapers here are rarely able to endorse the political and economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia. The right-wing "People's Friend" reported, "It is difficult for even the most well-meaning commentators to say that this agreement is a victory for French diplomacy. We can understand this by observing the reactions of Germany and Italy to this matter." The "Little Daily" reported, "France has long hoped for closer ties between Italy and Yugoslavia, and it is gratifying that this wish has now been fulfilled. However, we must carefully consider the changes in Yugoslavia's diplomatic policy." The "Republican Report" stated, "Yugoslavia has gained many benefits on the surface, but it is unknown what price it has paid. We believe that in addition to the formal clauses, there are secret clauses in this agreement, or at least supplementary clauses." The right-wing "Paris Echo" reported, "Germany and Italy have long planned to conclude bilateral agreements with neighboring countries, so that these countries cannot jointly resist aggression in the future. Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović has fallen into the trap of Germany and Italy, and the extent of this will be known in the coming weeks." The communist "Humanity" reported, "There is no doubt that this agreement has dealt a major blow to France's allies in Central Europe." (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas)

Germany [Berlin] The original text of the Italian-Yugoslav agreement arrived too late, so German newspapers did not have time to comment on it in their Easter editorials. However, all newspapers had brief comments. ㊀ The political part of the treaty is regarded as parallel to the German-Polish Pact. The Berlin Municipal Daily reported that before the German-Polish Pact was signed, there were frequent disagreements between Germany and Poland. Once the German-Polish Pact was signed, all past grievances disappeared. The same is true for Italian-Yugoslav relations. The signing of the Italian-Yugoslav treaty can immediately end the turmoil in the Adriatic Sea. From now on, the two countries will be friendly forever and will not be mere tools of large blocs. The fact that this new pact will enhance Italy's power in the Danube region is also recognized. ㊁ The Italian-Yugoslav Pact can strengthen the Rome-Berlin Axis, so a major German newspaper reported, "We (Germans) should very much welcome the signing of the Italian-Yugoslav treaty, because the relations between the two countries are now ushering in a new era of peaceful cooperation." (26th, National News Agency)

Czech Republic The Czech capital official circles commented on the Italian-Yugoslav agreement, believing that it is a valuable contribution to the consolidation of peace in Central Europe, which is the common desire of the Little Entente countries. Moreover, Article 6 of the new treaty stipulates that "the contracting parties agree that this agreement shall not be deemed to conflict with any international obligations already entered into by either of the contracting parties." In other words, the treaties that Yugoslavia has signed with other countries will not be harmed by this new treaty. This is a natural result of the evolution of the existing Little Entente system. "The Czech Capital Daily" stated that the rapprochement between Italy and Yugoslavia is not an accidental event, but the result of a long period of diplomatic activity. The other two countries of the Little Entente were consulted in advance on this diplomatic activity and fully agreed to it. The Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries will be held in the Yugoslav capital at the beginning of next month, and Czech President Beneš will also visit Yugoslavia. The issues raised by the Italian-Yugoslav agreement will be discussed in detail at that time. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas)

Hungary ⊙ Hungarian Capital The major Hungarian newspapers expressed great welcome to the new Italian-Yugoslav treaty, believing that the treaty is a further guarantee to promote peace in Southeastern Europe, while strengthening Italy's position in the Mediterranean. It is believed here that there will be significant progress in Hungarian-Yugoslav relations, as an understanding has been reached between Rome and the Yugoslav capital. (26th, National News Agency)

Romania ⊙ Romanian Capital Most newspapers here commented on the Italian-Yugoslav agreement, expressing welcome and attaching particular importance to Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović's declaration to the press that "this new treaty is not intended to target any other country." "The Romanian Independent" stated, "The Italian-Yugoslav agreement does not conflict with the Little Entente Treaty structure. All of Yugoslavia's current international obligations are guaranteed in the new treaty." "Adeverul" stated, "This new agreement will further consolidate the Little Entente group and strengthen Yugoslavia's tasks under the Little Entente Treaty." (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas)

### Hungarian Prime Minister Issues Statement

Austrian-Hungarian Cooperation Within the Rome Protocols Framework

⊙ Hungarian Capital Prime Minister Daranyi recently issued a statement to the press, stating, "The Austrian Chancellor recently visited Hungary and, after discussions between the two sides, it was proven that Austria and Hungary share the same views on the international political situation. From now on, the two countries should seek friendly cooperation within the framework of the Rome Protocols and, in particular, adopt a common attitude towards various issues related to Austria and Hungary. As for the political and economic agreement signed between Italy and Yugoslavia, it is the result of Italy's efforts to seek mutual cooperation among Central European countries."

In short, Hodža's trip has great significance." (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas)

### Spanish Government Forces Advance Victoriously

Two Armies Fight Over Mercury Mine, Fierce Battle Expected in Southern Suburbs

⊙ Andújar, Southern Region A special dispatch from our correspondent reports that government forces continued their offensive in the Pozoblanco area today, advancing seven kilometers towards the town of Nuvattedog and ten kilometers towards the town of Agaraseius, and occupying the heights near the Gondoblanco mining area. At the same time, the air force of the government forces continued to bomb the Nationalist forces in the Pozoblanco area, with great success. In addition, a squad of government forces militia, braving dangers, blew up a railway bridge, and a Nationalist military train of more than 30 vehicles was prevented from advancing. The government forces' aircraft then bombed the train, destroying most of it. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas)

⊙ Valencia It is expected that the government forces and the Nationalist forces will soon fight fiercely again in the Pozoblanco area to compete for the Almaden, the world's most important mercury mine. The mine was originally mined by Italians, and its mining rights expired when the Spanish Civil War was about to break out. Mercury prices are now almost on par with gold. If the mine is occupied, it can effectively monopolize the world mercury market. Therefore, the Nationalist forces are trying to seize it. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters)

⊙ Valencia Several Nationalist aircraft bombed Alga Chete San Juan City (southeast of Madrid) last night, destroying many houses. So far, four people have died and more than 20 have been injured. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas)

[London] The Daily Herald recently reported that villagers in the southwestern Spanish provinces of Extremadura and southern Andalucia have recently been ambushing Nationalist forces and attacking isolated units of Nationalist forces at night, disrupting the Nationalist forces' rear positions. In addition, "the internal organization of the Nationalist forces is extremely incomplete, and they often fail to concentrate sufficient forces when attacking. When the government forces implement a counteroffensive, they are unable to resist due to a lack of artillery and sufficient ammunition, leading to a complete collapse of the entire line. In addition, conflicts often arise between Spanish and Italian soldiers, and German soldiers, tired of the war, mostly retreat to the rear and act as bystanders." (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas)

Regarding this matter, Catalan President Companys issued a statement to the press after the cabinet meeting today, stating only that the cabinet crisis has broken out and that the government will issue a formal statement tomorrow, without mentioning anything else.

### Report of Intent to Assure England of Cessation of Troop Dispatch to the West

Willing to Reopen Negotiations on the Issue of Withdrawing Volunteer Soldiers; It is Said that Italy is Concentrating Large Forces Awaiting Departure

[London] The "Daily Telegraph" reported today that the Italian government has informed Britain that it is willing to discuss the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from Spain within days and has reiterated its assurance that Italy will not continue to send volunteer soldiers to Spain. (National Telegram, 26th)

[London] Newspapers are still paying attention to the Spanish civil war. It is generally believed that the German government has advised Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to proceed with caution. However, according to information obtained here, Italy has again dispatched large numbers of troops to Spain. It is said that two Italian army corps are concentrated near the port of Naples awaiting orders. The Daily Telegraph stated, "Regarding the prohibition of volunteer soldiers from traveling to Spain, Italy has reached an agreement with other countries. We have no reason to believe that the country has relaxed its ban." As for the issue of withdrawing volunteer soldiers from Spain, it will be resubmitted to the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee for discussion as soon as possible. The chances of success are greater than if it were submitted to the League of Nations for discussion. (Havas Agency Telegram, 27th, Central News Agency)

[London] Hundreds of thousands of residents of the capital are going to the countryside and seaside to spend the Easter holiday. During these four days off, they will temporarily put aside their troubles and enjoy themselves while they can. In previous years, the capital would present a silent scene at this time.

### Mexico Anti-Catholic Movement: Pope Issues Encyclical

⊙Vatican City Pope Pius XI, in response to the anti-Catholic movement occurring in Mexico, will issue an encyclical during Easter, discussing the matter. The main idea is to urge Mexican clergy and believers to resolutely defend Christian doctrines, stating, "The peace and prosperity of all countries depend greatly on various Christian endeavors. If Mexican clergy and believers can tirelessly promote the Holy Word, then Mexico can have peace and prosperity." The encyclical also asks non-Catholics to cooperate with the clergy and support missionary work in religious, moral, and economic aspects, so that the bourgeoisie can believe in the faith. It is noted that the Church has successively issued three encyclicals concerning Mexican Church affairs. The first was issued in 1926, and the second in 1932. Both times, protests were solemnly raised due to Mexico's mistreatment of the clergy. (Havas Agency Telegram, 27th, Central News Agency)

### Activities of Japanese Economic Survey Mission Member Kato After Arriving in Tianjin

Exchanging Opinions with Chinese and Japanese Figures; States That the Mission Has Achieved Very Little

Tianjin Correspondence: Kato Keizaburo, a member of the Japanese Economic Survey Mission and President of the Bank of Korea, arrived in Tianjin at 11:00 AM on the 25th via the Shanghai-Pingjin train. Originally, more than just Kato were planning to come to Tianjin as members of the mission. Kiyojiro Miyajima, President of Nisshin Spinning, and Shasuke Ishida, a director of Mitsui, were also supposed to arrive in Tianjin by China Aviation aircraft on the 23rd to exchange economic cooperation opinions with various parties in North China. However, due to snowfall on that day, the aircraft was delayed. Miyajima and Ishida then went to Qingdao together with Iio Ichiji and Ohira Kensaku from the mission to inspect industries in Qingdao. Ishida returned directly to Japan by ship, while Miyajima and Ohira will come to Tianjin at the end of the month to meet with various parties. Iio plans to return to Shanghai at the end of the month, stay for a few days, and then return to Japan. Kato's visit to the north this time is on behalf of the mission to explore opinions on economic cooperation with China with key Japanese officials stationed in North China, especially to verify and align the North China economic development matters promoted by the Japanese garrison headquarters with the mission's intentions. The Japanese military headquarters here also wanted to hear the results of the mission's activities in Beijing and Shanghai, and hoped that Kato could come as soon as possible. After arriving in Tianjin on the 25th, Kato attended a gathering hosted by the Japanese economic and financial community at noon. At 5:00 PM, he attended a symposium at the Japanese Consulate General in the British Concession at the invitation of the Japanese military headquarters and leaders of the Japanese commercial community. Those present from the military headquarters were Asai and Nagamine, key members of the Economic Advisory Department. Those present from the Consulate General were Consul General Horiuchi, Consul Ogihara, and Vice-Consul Nagai. Those present from the Chamber of Commerce were Chairman Horie, as well as leaders from the Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui, and Iwanaka, among others. Kato explained in detail the visits to various Chinese authorities and the proceedings of the meeting in Shanghai. The participants here provided reference materials on the current economic situation in North China. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. Kato then hosted a tea party at the Astor House Hotel in the British Concession. Dozens of people from the Chinese and Japanese economic and business circles were invited to participate, including Zhang Zizhong and Li Sihao. Kato, in his capacity as a representative of the Japanese private capital group, exchanged opinions on economic cooperation with the attendees and freely expressed his views for reference by the industrial and economic community upon his return to Japan. The gathering ended around 8:00 PM.

On the afternoon of the 25th, Kato told visiting foreign reporters, "The original intention of the Japanese Economic Survey Mission to China was to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations and avoid prolonged pessimism. At the first meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association in Shanghai, all members were able to meet with sincerity and exchange opinions earnestly. The general opinion on the Chinese side was to request Japan to reflect on its actions. Due to differences in viewpoints, the results still did not escape pessimism, and it was not possible to achieve the expected results. However, one point is deeply valuable: that this opportunity deepened the friendship between Chinese and Japanese business leaders. The biggest obstacle in this discussion was, of course, the North China issue. After returning to Japan, our mission will sincerely inform the people of the country that they should carefully consider the actual situation in China and seek other ways to deal with it."

Li Sihao came to Tianjin on the morning of the 25th at Kato's invitation to attend his tea party. He returned to Beijing that evening. According to Li, "Negotiations on the economic development of North China are currently at a standstill. Ikeda, a staff officer of the Japanese military headquarters, has returned to Japan to raise capital and is expected to return to his post early next month. Regarding the construction of the Cangshi Road and the restoration of the Longyan Mine, the Japanese side intends to use 24 million yuan from the Sino-Japanese cultural enterprise fund as a subsidy, but whether this will be agreed upon by the government and the public in Japan will depend on the results of Ikeda's activities this time."

### Wave of Opposition to Business Tax Levy Among Guangdong Merchants

Firmly Requesting that Taxes Continue to be Levied Based on Turnover; Joint Petition by Chambers of Commerce from Various Regions

Guangzhou Correspondence: After the promulgation of the new business tax regulations in Guangdong Province, it sparked opposition from merchants throughout the province. The government has refused to revoke its decision, while merchants have delayed reporting their income. Therefore, this case has not been resolved for the past two or three months. Until recently, the Finance Department, in order to appease the merchants, only agreed to reduce the business tax rate, but did not approve the change in tax standards requested by the merchants. The reduction in the business tax rate involved taxing cotton yarn, grain, homespun cloth, yarn, and silk at a rate of 1-2 per thousand based on turnover. In addition, the special tax on imported goods for printing newspapers, originally set at 2 yuan per 100 catties, has also been exempted. Furthermore, the capital and turnover of Guangdong stores were previously based on Guangdong silver certificates, while the business tax regulations stipulated that the business tax collected would be calculated in silver dollars, which was unfair. This has also been improved. All businesses reporting income in silver certificates are allowed to pay taxes at a 30% reduction of the tax amount. The deadline for businesses that have not reported their turnover has been extended to the end of March.

The Finance Department's revised reduced business tax measures were promulgated on the 22nd. (A) Classification Tax Rate: Goods sales industry, taxed based on total business income, the original tax rate was 5-1 per thousand, temporarily reduced to 2-0.8 per thousand; specially licensed commercial industries, the original 5 per thousand, reduced to 3 per thousand; hotel industry, the original 5 per thousand; contracting industry, the original 5 per thousand, reduced to 4 per thousand; transportation industry, the original 5 per thousand, reduced to 3 per thousand; bathhouses and barber shops, the original 5 per thousand; introduction and agency industry, originally taxed at 8 per thousand, reduced to 100 per thousand of customs declaration fees; brokerage industry, originally taxed at 8 per thousand, reduced to 100 per thousand of commissions; teahouses, Western and Chinese restaurants, the original 8 per thousand, reduced to 6 per thousand; Western-style clothing, goods leasing, and photography industries, the original 8 per thousand; hotels, warehouses, docks, markets, slaughterhouses, and entertainment venues, the original 10 per thousand; printing and publishing industries, taxed based on capital, the original 5 per thousand; manufacturing and processing industries, trust industries, and real estate sales industries, the original 10 per thousand; silver shops, the original 15 per thousand. (B) Goods Sales Tax Rate: ① First level: Grain, firewood, charcoal, oil, salt, peanuts, and meat are classified as the grain industry; noodle industry is classified as the grain industry; machine-woven homespun cloth and cotton yarn, the original tax rate was 5 per thousand, temporarily reduced to 2 per thousand for wholesale and 3 per thousand for retail; silk, books and stationery, educational supplies, coal industry, used clothing, shoes and hats, combs, silk cocoons, oils, fan industry, straw woven products, rattan woven products, bamboo utensils, fir furniture, suitcases, hemp weaving, fresh fruits, dried and fresh meats, poultry, fresh and salted fish and eggs, medicinal materials, pastries, ceramics, steel molds, seed industry, ink industry, tea, fertilizer industry, flags, weights and measures industry, marble, mosquito coils, curtains, toothbrushes, bones and horns, dried lotus leaves, cow bones, hair, sauces, salted and dried fried peanuts, preserved fruits, beef bone powder, soap, etc., and others, the original tax was 5 per thousand, reduced to 4 per thousand. ② Second level: Soda, ice cream, electrical appliances, paints, etc., and others, the original tax was 8 per thousand, reduced to 6 per thousand. ③ Third level: Cosmetics, red sandalwood, rosewood, cypress, etc., and others, the original tax was 10 per thousand, reduced to 8 per thousand. On the merchant side, the Finance Department's promulgation of the above-mentioned reduction in business tax rates has not yet addressed the requests of all merchants. The Finance Department still insists on collecting taxes based on turnover, while the merchants have been seeking day and night to change the tax standard from turnover to capital, reverting to the previous standard of taxing based on capital. Therefore, representatives from various regions such as Foshan, Jiangmen, Chencun, Shiqiao, Shantou, Haikou, Shenzhen, Digang, Nanxiong, Panyu, Lechang, Taishan, Qingyuan, Gaoyao, Qujiang, etc., gathered in Guangzhou on the 23rd and 24th to discuss and unanimously strive for their demands. They also took the opportunity of Chairman Lin's visit to Guangdong to petition Chairman Lin. All merchants will not report their business tax until this case is satisfactorily resolved, and those who have already reported will postpone paying their taxes. Merchants from all over the province, such as the cotton yarn industry, kerosene industry, cigarette industry, sugar and noodle industry, proprietary medicine industry, indigenous oil and noodle industry, silk, yarn, velvet, raw medicine, ginseng, fresh fruits, cocoa, railway transportation, bean industry, tea industry, paper industry, salted goods industry, pig pens, prepared medicine industry, Western clothing, curtain industry, hotel industry, photography industry, leather shoe materials industry, fresh fish market, tobacco industry, noodle industry, cloth industry, rice industry, straw mat industry, umbrella industry, fir industry, cake industry, cigarette industry, Western dyeing industry, restaurant industry, teahouse industry, firewood shop, Ban Hua grocery industry, homespun weaving industry, rice milling industry, rice and sugar industry, Beijing confectionery and seafood industry, customs declaration industry, glass industry, brick and tile industry, north-south brokerage industry, machinery industry, porcelain industry, used clothing industry, machine-woven shirts and socks industry, tea house industry, copper and iron industry, brush industry, tobacco industry, medicinal oil industry, fresh fish industry, salted fish industry, and brewing industry, a total of more than 800 representatives from more than 120 industries, held a meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce on the 24th. It was decided to fight to the death to strive for the business tax standard and request the government to withdraw the decision to levy taxes based on the business tax amount, and to hold a province-wide merchants' petition on the 27th. First, they will present their difficulties to Chairman Lin of the National Government, and then go to the Guangdong Provincial Government, Guangdong Pacification Commissioner's Office, Headquarters of the Fourth Route Army, Guangdong Department of Finance, and other agencies to complain. At that time, each store in each industry will send one representative to organize a petition group, which will gather in the Taiping Road area before 8:00 AM. If the petition group is suppressed at that time, they will immediately disband, and all stores will close and suspend business. If the petition does not yield satisfactory results, all stores will go on strike until a satisfactory solution is reached. During the shutdown period, any store that violates the public will be effectively sanctioned by the representative group. (March 25)

### Various Groups in Beijing Request Suspension of Salt Tax Surcharge

Beijing News: Regarding the issue of the salt tax surcharge in Beijing, after the salt industry groups petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the Salt Affairs Department to suspend the collection, the authorities expressed their acceptance, but no official order has been seen. Therefore, various commercial groups in Beijing are again appealing to party and government agencies, requesting exemption from the collection. Excerpts from the documents submitted separately by the pickle industry, the oil, sugar, and southern goods industry, and the transportation industry associations to the Ministry of Finance, the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau are as follows: ① Document submitted to the Ministry of Finance: "It is noted that since the opening of salt sales in Beijing, the quality has been good and the price has been fair, and the citizens have been celebrating. Suddenly, in June of last year, the Jianghai Customs Inspection Bureau, upon order, posted notices throughout the streets, announcing that a public welfare donation of 6.665 yuan per dan would be levied on salt in Beijing, to be implemented immediately. It is noted that the Huaibei salt and refined salt sold in Beijing have already paid a full regular tax of 7.1 yuan per dan, plus salt cost and transportation fees, the selling price is already close to 10 yuan. The salt price in Beijing is already considerable, and salt is an essential element of people's food, and cannot be lacking for a single day. Among the million inhabitants, except for a few wealthy families who may not pay attention, the majority of the poor people use salt as the main food for their lives. Once a huge surcharge is suddenly added, regardless of the direct increase in the burden of life, in the government it is only a word, in the people it already feels the weight of a thousand jun. Thinking that the covenant contains the explicit text of exempting excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes, if the people's strength is not enough, there should also be a proposal to withdraw the order. I hereby submit this document, requesting the Ministry to examine and consider the hardship of the citizens who cannot bear the burden, and exempt the public welfare donation of salt, in order to relieve the merchants' difficulties and save the people's strength, which would be a virtuous convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing City Transportation Industry Association. ② Document submitted to the Municipal Party Department: It is noted that the members of our association mostly sell salt as well. The current increase in the price of salt was initially thought to be due to salt merchants hoarding and increasing prices privately. We were about to submit a request to stop this, but after reading the newspaper report that the salt industry had petitioned the Ministry of Finance to cancel the public welfare donation, we realized that the increase in the price of salt was indeed due to an order from the Ministry of Finance. The members of our association were shocked upon reading this. It is noted that salt is a necessary product for human life and cannot be separated from it for a single day. Therefore, from ancient times to the present, it has been state-operated, precisely because we fear that merchants will hoard and increase prices at will, causing the people to lack salt. I respectfully read the National Government's clear order of July 20, 1934, to the senior military and political officials of each province, prohibiting the establishment of any name to collect additional taxes and donations under the item of salt, and ordering the county magistrates of each county to supervise and strictly stop this at any time. The virtuous intentions of the National Government to cherish the people's livelihood are evident, because if taxes and donations are not increased, the price of salt will be fair, and the people's livelihood can be abundant. Now the Ministry of Finance is establishing a special name to collect the Beijing public welfare donation, regardless of whether it has been approved by the Legislative Yuan or filed with the Executive Yuan, but although it is directly levied on the salt merchants, it is indirectly transferred to the people. It does not take into account the National Government's clear orders and the principle of the people's livelihood. This is one reason why the order should be withdrawn. This additional item is named the public welfare donation. Whether the funds are used for national public welfare or only for Beijing has not been clearly specified. If it is used for the whole country, how can the million people of Beijing bear the burden of 445 million people? This is a matter of principle that is lost. If it is used for Beijing, then the municipal government's municipal expenses have their own land tax, business tax, slaughter tax, banquet tax, real estate vehicle donation, tap water, etc. income. Public welfare expenses have donations for cleaning, firefighting, and winter relief, etc. It seems that there is no need for the Ministry of Finance to overstep its authority. This is the inappropriateness of establishing a special public welfare donation name. This is the second reason why the order should be withdrawn. Beijing is ranked as the capital, and is the concern of the country and abroad. All white politics are touted throughout the country. Now, all provinces and cities in the country do not add surcharges to salt, and obey the order with caution. But Beijing is unique. How can it win the trust of the people? Moreover, at a time when foreign troubles are pressing and the people's livelihood is declining, how should we support the people's livelihood and safeguard government orders? Now, adding taxes on the million people's salt intake brings in only 100,000 yuan, a very small number, but it has caused the destruction of government orders and the fear of the people. This is what we expect to be impossible. Based on the above reasons, our association and other members are nationals, and we have great worries about the national economy and the people's livelihood. We dare not fail to contribute. We beg you to approve and forward this to the Ministry of Finance, to withdraw the order for the salt donation in order to respect the political system and value the people's livelihood, which would be a virtuous convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Nanjing Special City Party Department, Nanjing City Social Affairs Bureau, Oil and Salt Industry Southern Goods Industry Association, Pickling Industry Association."

Re-discussing the Promotion of Rice Seeds

The county's rice cultivation promotion committee previously decided to promote improved Maozitou indica rice of more than 2,400 dan this autumn, totaling 40,000 mu. Now, due to financial reasons, after consulting with the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, it has been reduced to promoting 10,000 mu, totaling more than 600 dan of rice seeds, with 5,000 yuan in funding, which will be appropriately allocated by the Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute. The promotion committee is currently purchasing rice seeds and re-deciding the promotion areas.

Wind and Snow Devastate Spring Crops

Since the beginning of spring, the climate in the county has been abnormal. The other day, a sudden gale roared and heavy snow flew. Spring crops such as wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed have been devastated by the wind and snow. It is feared that many will be barren and unproductive, and the harvest will definitely be sharply reduced. According to rural farmers, this spring's wheat harvest will be at most 50%.

Coal Mine Robbery Case Solved, Thieves Captured

The Kailuo Coal Mining Company outside Pingmen was robbed by bandits the other day. The bandits opened fire, killing military police officer Wu Peng and wounding squad leader Wang Youmin. One bandit was captured on the spot, and the remaining bandits fled without a trace. Later, the captured bandit confessed that there were accomplices, including Liu Deshen (also known as Liu San) and others. Therefore, the 6th Regiment of Military Police stationed in Suzhou sent troops in disguise to Xijin Bridge on the morning of the 27th, under the pretext of questioning, and captured Liu Deshen and five others. They were immediately sent to the regimental headquarters for interrogation. However, Liu Deshen denied being a bandit.

### Wuxi

Tax Police Capture Bandits

The 6th District Division of the Tax Police, located in Su Wu's Cotton Alley outside the west gate of this county, along with its subordinate tax police stationed in Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Jintan, Liyang, and other eight counties—specifically, the 41st Detachment stationed in Zhenjiang and Jiangdu—received a tip-off last month. The tip reported that a large number of salt smugglers had arrived at Longmenkou in Zhenjiang. Thereupon, Captain Sun immediately dispatched over seventy officers from the 2nd Squad, along with the Provincial Security Team, armed with guns, to suppress and capture the smugglers. The smugglers resisted fiercely, resulting in a fierce battle between the two sides. As a result, seven smugglers, including Shan Lao Er, Bian Chang San, Zhu Hong You, Zhu Xiao Huang Lian, Chu Jin Yuan, Liu Ma Zi, and Wu Chang Ming, were captured. The Provincial Security Team handed them over to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for investigation. However, since the case fell under the jurisdiction of the tax police, it was transferred back to the 41st Detachment of the Tax Police for legal proceedings. On the 25th, the detachment presented the bandits to the district division in this county. After interrogation, the district division, lacking a detention facility, immediately transferred the smugglers to the county police station for custody, pending further investigation.

Land Value Tax to Be Collected on Schedule

The Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to implement the collection of land value tax in Jiangsu Province starting from July 1st of the 26th year (i.e., 1937). The Provincial Land Administration has also ordered all counties to expedite the estimation of land values and the compilation of land value tax registers. The land values for all cities and towns in the respective counties must be estimated and publicly announced before the end of April of this year. Before the public announcement, draft plans should be submitted to the province for review and approval. The land value tax registers must be compiled and completed before the end of June.

Provincial Order to Cease Collecting Fishing Tax

Wuxi and Suzhou counties border Taihu Lake and have historically been fish-producing areas. Consequently, the two counties have as many as 20,000 fishing boats, with a total of over 30,000 fishermen. Traditionally, each boat paid an annual fishing tax of 400 cash, which has recently increased to 8 jiao. The collection and remittance of this tax were handled by the fishing chiefs and fishing headmen. Currently, the county only collects over 500 yuan in fishing tax annually, a significant discrepancy. Recently, the province, recognizing that this fishing tax was extremely small and amounted to petty harassment, specifically ordered the county government to abolish it. County Magistrate Long has already issued a public notice to this effect.

Grain Store Robbed in Hutang Bridge

At around 8 p.m. on the 26th, three robbers suddenly arrived at the Xu Yi Yu Grain Store in Hutang Bridge, outside the south gate of Wu County. They pretended to be customers, then drew out handguns, pointing them at the store staff and ordering them to be silent. They forced the staff to hand over the key and seized approximately ninety yuan in French currency and silver coins from the drawer, before fleeing. Afterwards, the store owner, Xu Xing Sheng, reported the incident to the police for investigation, but no progress has been made.

### Zhenjiang

Implementation of Land Tax Ticket System

In order to rectify the long-standing malpractices in land tax collection in various counties, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has specifically formulated a land tax ticket system. This system has been approved by the provincial government and listed as one of the key tasks for the next year. It is understood that, in addition to designating Yangzhong County to pilot the system this year, Jinshan, Lishui, Suining, Muyang, Taixing, Taixian, and Jiangdu counties, which have completed land reporting or are in the process of doing so, are expected to complete the process gradually within this year. The above-mentioned counties should implement the land tax ticket system in the second half of the year. It is reported that the Department of Finance will soon issue orders to the various counties to begin preparations. When preparing the next year's budget, the number of personnel involved in supervision and examination should be reduced as much as possible, while the number of bank tax collectors should be appropriately increased. Other expenses should also be adjusted based on actual needs.

### Yangzhou

A Prelude to Clearing Up Garrison Tax

The dispute over garrison land in Jiangdu has remained unresolved for more than a decade. A meeting of party and government officials once decided to adopt the method of paying for government property to implement mediation, but it still failed to achieve results. This has led to significant losses of garrison tax over the past decade. It is now heard that it is planned to order the garrison tenants to pay the garrison tax first, in order to facilitate clearing up the situation. It is also heard that a certain county with a similar dispute has already ordered the tenants to pay the land tax to finalize the case. This area plans to follow suit.

### Jia Dehuai Discusses

Levying Income Tax on Foreign Nationals

According to the Central News Agency, since the implementation of income tax in China, the people in various regions have been extremely supportive, and the process has been smooth. However, income tax on foreign nationals has not yet been implemented and should be promoted as soon as possible, so that Chinese and foreign people within the country can receive equal treatment. A reporter recently interviewed Jia Dehuai, who was sent by the former Hubei Provincial Government to Europe and the United States to study financial affairs. According to Jia's discussion on the issue of levying income tax on foreign nationals, the following points were made:

Fairness, Universality, and Low Tax Rates Jia stated that the implementation of income tax not only adds a unique touch to financial history, but also represents a progressive step in the taxation system. The first category of income, profits from business operations, is based on the principle of maintaining small-scale businesses. The second category of income, salaries and remuneration, is based on the principle of lightly taxing labor income. The third category of income, interest from securities and savings deposits, is based on the principle of slightly heavier taxation of unearned income. However, the tax rates are low, lower than in any other country. The essence of income tax lies in fairness and universality. All income originating from China and residents within China must pay taxes according to the law. If the levy does not extend to foreign nationals, it would not only hinder national sovereignty, but also harm the national economy.

International Treaties Respect Sovereignty Regarding the various treaties concluded between China and other countries, such as the Washington Treaty, it is stated that, "China's sovereignty and independence, as well as the integrity of its territory and administration, should be respected." The Most Favored Nation Treaty also seeks international equality based on the principle of "equal treatment in taxation for Chinese and foreign goods." Consular jurisdiction is also limited to civil and criminal cases, while the administrative power of taxation still belongs to us. Based on these three points, it is sufficient to prove that the levying of income tax on foreign nationals is not subject to any treaty restrictions. Moreover, the scope of income tax levied by countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Russia, and Japan covers residents within the country and tax sources originating from their own countries, regardless of nationality.

Tax Collection Methods Should Strive for Simplicity Article 22 of China's Provisional Regulations on Income Tax does not differentiate between domestic and foreign nationals, which is extremely fair. However, since foreigners residing in the country are scattered in various regions, the tax collection techniques should be as perfect and simple as possible. In my opinion, the first category of profit income, Item A, which includes profits from companies, firms, shops, factories, and individual businesses, and Item B, which includes profits from businesses jointly operated by government and merchants, should both apply the reporting method. Item C, temporary business income, regardless of whether it is a foreign legal entity or a foreign individual, should apply the source tax method. For the second category of salary and remuneration income, except for diplomatic officials and others who should be exempt from taxation according to regulations, both the source tax and reporting methods should be applied. For salary and remuneration income of foreign nationals engaged in freelance professions and various industries, if paid by an employer, whether the employer is foreign or Chinese, the employer should be responsible for withholding and remitting the tax on a monthly basis. If self-employed, they should report and pay the tax themselves. For the third category, securities, deposits, and government bonds (limited to domestic bonds), foreign nationals holding government bonds should have their interest income withheld by the domestic payment institution. For companies and stocks, the source tax method should be applied. For interest income from foreign nationals' deposits, the foreign legal entity paying the interest should be responsible for withholding it. It is hoped that the consuls of various countries will respect China's sovereignty and actively support this. It is also hoped that foreign nationals will transfer their habits of directly paying taxes in their home countries, investigate the source of net profit, and be happy to contribute.

### The First Special District Federation Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday

Oppose the Municipal Council's Increase in General Rates Resolved to Ask the Board of Directors for Reconsideration, and Issue an Open Letter to Citizens

According to the Central News Agency, the First Special District Citizens' Federation of this city convened an emergency meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday in the conference room on the third floor of the City Chamber of Commerce to discuss the matter of opposing the Municipal Council's increase in rates. The meeting was attended by representatives including Zhang Juansheng, Ren Nongxuan, Zhang Xianfang, Ye Qichang, Yu Yaoqiu, Zhu Yutao, Zhou Lianze, Ge Futian, Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Bangjun, Wang Jingdong, Zhao Nangong, and Zhang Tianbai, totaling more than sixty people. Lin Kanghou, Wang Manyun, Cao Zhigong, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Yichen, and Liu Zhongying served as the presidium.

Resolutions Passed Chairman Lin Kanghou first reported the significance of convening this meeting, and then began the discussion. The following resolutions were passed: 1. Send a letter to the Municipal Council Board of Directors to reconsider and revoke the proposed increase in general rates. Resolution: Passed. 2. Send a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Foreign Ratepayers' Association, expressing disapproval of the proposal. Resolution: Passed. 3. Convene a joint meeting of various organizations. Resolution: To be convened when necessary. 4. Notify all district branches to prepare effective measures. Resolution: To be handled by the Executive Committee. 5. Issue an open letter to citizens. Resolution: Passed.

Open Letter to Citizens Fellow citizens of the First Special District of Shanghai, after the "January 28th Incident," we have not yet recovered from our grief, and we are about to suffer from the deliberate exploitation of our "quasi-autonomous organs" responsible public servants. What is going on? It is the Municipal Council's Board of Directors meeting on March 24th, the Board of Directors meeting chaired by Mr. Arnold, disregarding the economic decline of our citizens, disregarding the opinions of the five Chinese directors who represent more than 64% of the rates paid and more than 95% of the population, that they have established a proposal to be submitted to the Ratepayers' Meeting. What is this proposal? It is to increase the burden that our citizens cannot bear, that is, to increase the municipal general rates (commonly known as police rates) by 2 li from 14% to 16%, and to increase the land tax by 1 li, from 7 per thousand to 8 per thousand. This is such a cruel exploitation that disregards the plight of the citizens! We citizens all know our own economic pain and do not need to be told. What we want to say now is the financial position of the Municipal Council, in what situation is it, is it possible to get by without increasing the rates, is it possible to get by safely and steadily? We know that the financial position of the Municipal Council has always been solid. Why has it become unstable, or seems to be unstable? It is the responsibility of the responsible public servants. First, the exchange allowance for senior foreign staff, we probably haven't forgotten it, have we? How much higher was the salary after the European war than it is now? At the most, one tael of silver in Shanghai could be exchanged for nine shillings in British currency. Under those circumstances, the senior foreign staff of the Municipal Council received a lot of unexpected benefits because of the high exchange rate, but the Municipal Council did not reduce their salaries because of the high exchange rate. However, when silver became cheap and gold became expensive, they thought of "exchange allowances" because of the falling exchange rate. It can also be said that the sudden rise and fall of the exchange rate, the lives of the staff, must be planned for stability, so that they have no worries, and have to give allowances, but once the exchange rate is stable, there is time to prepare for life, why still give allowances? Naturally, they sold the electricity, and sold it for 81 million taels, which is equivalent to 113.1 million national currency, which can be generous to the ratepayers. In total, this exchange allowance costs more than 2 million yuan a year at most, even now that China's exchange rate has been stable for a long time, that is, in 1937, it still needs 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan, that kind of expenditure is so unreasonable, but are they ultimately seeking the happiness of the citizens? Please let us all think about it, we citizens have lost more than 10 million yuan with just this one item. Then, the expenditure of the Municipal Council will naturally be larger. Second, the music band, the abolition of the music band, has already been a successful consensus. The representatives of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association have already resolved it for three or four years, but Mr. Arnold does not know why, and ultimately uses various methods to maintain it. Think about it, it costs 260,000 yuan a year, and how much does it cost to calculate for four years? With this kind of method, even the original extremely solid budget can still be balanced? Handling private enterprises, using this method, would still be a mess, and public organs, if they do not care about the people's suffering, how can they do well? Third, the Russian team, which is similar to an army, which municipal organ in the world has such equipment? Moreover, the Municipal Council is still a "quasi-municipal organ"? In fact, if there is a serious situation, what can this team do? Shanghai has not been without major serious situations, what did the team do? Spending 100,000 to 200,000 yuan a year is really a waste. Fourth, the expansion of police expenditure, in 1912, the Municipal Council's police expenditure was only more than 1 million yuan a year, and by 1929, it increased to 5.58 million yuan, which was already shocking, and this year it increased to 9.9 million yuan, which is close to 10 million yuan. If it can really be safe, it can also get the comfort of our citizens, but the facts tell our citizens that the Bank of Communications on Nanjing Road was robbed at more than 11 o'clock in the morning, and the robbers have not yet been captured, and public buses are also being robbed. For the demolition of grass sheds that infringe on other people's property rights, for the placement of obstacles that infringe on other people's traffic rights, for the arrest of hawkers that infringe on other people's business rights, for the arrest of beggars that infringe on other people's freedom, for the arrest of all people below the poverty line, everything is quickly done, and the red police cars, motorcycles, and fully armed Chinese and foreign detectives are all available. If we follow the economic principle of "obtaining the greatest effect with the smallest cost", do we citizens think it is appropriate, should it be? Fifth, the position of the president, I don't know which article it is recorded in the Yangjingbang Real Estate Regulations, and I don't know what it does. It is probably for the convenience of jumping out of the Board of Directors, for the convenience of dealing with the Yugu Village incident. Spending about 50,000 yuan a year, what benefits do we citizens get, what kind of happiness is there? Sixth, arrears, if the Municipal Council can make the arrears public, I am afraid it will make us citizens know that there are about 2 million yuan. I am afraid that the proportion of arrears is the least for us citizens who are in the position of landlords. Collecting all these arrears can already balance the budget for this year with a surplus. Why not pursue the arrears that have no problems in law? Why can we citizens be so serious about the Yugu Village general rates, which have become a problem in law, and say it loudly, and dare not move on to others? Maybe it is eating hard and not eating soft. The above are all direct reasons for making the budget unbalanced. The following will talk about the passive reasons. First, public utilities, such as electricity, telephones, trams, tap water, tap fire, and public buses, all give him the highest guaranteed interest, the falling exchange rate requires price increases, the rising prices require price increases, the unscientific management of expenses requires price increases, and the increase in capital itself requires price increases. Because the pricing is too high, there is disguised competition, resulting in a decrease in operating income, which also requires price increases, forcing us citizens who use public utilities to try to move other food, clothing, housing expenses, and use them for public enjoyment. As a result, all industries are affected, and residential business is gradually shrinking, and the income from general rates has a phenomenon of temporary shortages of 700,000 yuan. Second, the rent is not levied according to the actual rent, and the amount is forcibly estimated to be high, so that we citizens live in a situation where the rates are not increased in name, but have already been increased, forcing us to close shops, close factories, move, and shrink. Naturally, the general rates will decrease accordingly. Third, the land price is not changed. In the past, the land price estimated by the Municipal Council was always below the market price, about 3%, commonly known as 70% discount. Now, because of the January 28th Incident, the land price has fallen below the estimated price. The real estate industry association requested to reduce the estimated price, but it was ignored. Therefore, the owners, due to high costs, dare not rush to reduce rent, and dare not build houses on vacant land. The high cost of rent, there is no one in business and residence, and the general rates are reduced. The Municipal Council's balanced budget will naturally be affected by this. In addition, in the past three years, the Municipal Council has supported the progress of public buses, making it difficult for cars to park, and restricting or reducing other vehicles, and restricting advertising banners, all of which have indirectly affected businesses, leading to a cold market, and reducing income from general rates, etc. Fellow citizens, our association is the successor of the joint association of businesses on various roads. The joint association of businesses has reached the spirit of "no representatives, no taxes" with the Municipal Council having Chinese directors and Chinese committee members, but it has not yet met the original expectations. May I ask, 1. Do we citizens have the right to decide on the proposed案 of the Municipal Council Board of Directors? 2. Do we citizens have the right to decide on the reports, budgets, and final accounts of the Municipal Council? 3. Have we citizens received equal treatment in education? 4. Is the number of seats for our Chinese directors and Chinese committee members based on the proportion of taxes paid? Fellow citizens, everyone must understand, everyone should understand how much the British Empire and the United States of America, etc., sympathize with our country, and how far away are our Municipal Council's responsible public servants from this kind of sympathy? The slogans that we citizens should have are: 1. Revoke the proposal to increase rates that represents a small number of citizens and a small amount of taxes. 2. We citizens must exercise the final right to decide on the Municipal Council's behavior, reports, proposals, budgets, and final accounts. 3. We citizens have the right to create municipal facilities for the Municipal Council. 4. The number of seats for our Chinese directors and Chinese committee members, even if it is not based on the proportion of the population, should also be based on the proportion of taxes paid, and should be implemented as soon as possible. Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, 26.3.27.

### Lu Bohong Will Go to Henan Next Week to Investigate and Distribute Disaster Relief Funds

### Kodama's Shanghai Maru Seized at Shanghai Customs for Smuggling Copper Coins

Over 500,000 Coins Valued at Over 1,000 Yuan - Ronin Considered Overall Image and Did Not Initiate Conflict

In recent times, Japanese and Korean ronin have been extremely rampant in Shanghai with smuggling and violence. The matter of the Dayang Maru smuggling copper coins for export and assaulting customs officers has not yet been resolved. This morning, the Shanghai Maru, carrying Kodama and his party, a Japanese economic study group returning to their country, was again caught by customs smuggling copper coins out of the country. According to reports, the Shanghai Maru arrived at the port around 8 o'clock the night before, docked at the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou, and finished unloading its cargo late at night. The smuggling company organized by Japanese and Korean ronin immediately began to load and transport the smuggled copper coins, while also sending ronin and hooligans to set up guards at the wharf. At that time, although customs officers were already aware of the smuggling, they did not stop it because they had already decided on a proper method of capture. At 6:45 this morning, Huang Yongqi, the leader of the third squad of the inspection team, was dispatched with eight anti-smuggling personnel and three sailors to board the Shanghai Maru on a customs launch for inspection. A large number of copper coins and seventeen specially made vests for secretly hiding copper coins were found in the laundry room, the drying room, and the water tank. Two large wooden vats filled with copper coins were also found on the wharf, totaling more than 500,000 coins, worth more than 1,000 yuan in national currency. All of these items were moved onto the customs launch and sent to customs for confiscation. The operation was completed at 8:10. When customs officials went to inspect, the smuggling ronin initially planned to commit violence and seize the goods, but considering that Kodama and others were boarding the ship to return to their country that morning, and fearing that it would damage their image too much, they were stopped by the police of the Japanese Consulate, and no conflict occurred. However, if a fundamental solution to eliminate such smuggling incidents cannot be found, future disputes will only be on the rise. (Central News Agency)

Kodama Kenji, Asaka Otsuji, Fujiyama Aiichiro, Yutani Kyoichi, Takami Goro, as well as attendants Nakamura Seiji and Hatsuzuka Yasutaro, boarded the Japan Mail Shanghai Maru yesterday morning to return to their country. Iio Kazuji is currently in Qingdao and will come to Shanghai in a few days and is scheduled to wait for a ship to return to his country on the 31st.

Departure from Shanghai Yesterday Morning

The Shanghai Maru was docked at the Yangshupu Huishan Wharf. Kodama and others left the International Hotel around 8 o'clock and went to the port. People from various parties who came to see them off were already waiting at the port and accompanied them to board the ship, shaking hands and saying goodbye. Flower baskets and other gifts from various parties were placed in the main living room. Zhou Zuomin, Chairman of the China-Japan Trade Association, went to Hangzhou to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and returned to Shanghai that evening, also accompanied by Secretary-General Xu Xiuzhi and Secretary Zhou Wenbin to the port to see them off. The ship set sail at 9 o'clock.

Farewell from All Circles

Other farewell personnel included Wang Changchun, representative of Mayor Wu, Xi Demao, representative of Minister Kong, Zhou Jue, Director of the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Local Association, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as well as Wu Yunzhai, Qian Xinzhi, Zhong Bingfeng, Ba Zuo Ting, Wang Xuxi, Wang Yiting, Hu Boxiang, Chen Bofan, as well as Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Kita, Assistant Military Attaché Utsunomiya, Naval Attaché Honda, Assistant Naval Attaché Kusunoki, Consul General Kawai, Yabuki, Yoshida, Boku, Yamamoto, Kan'no, etc.

Industrial Cooperation The China-Japan Economic Cooperation was conducted by members of the two associations holding discussion meetings. After exchanging opinions on the financial and industrial aspects, it was decided to establish two committees, the Financial Committee and the Industrial Committee. The organization of the Industrial Committee is divided into textile, cotton, and finance departments, etc., and fifteen people are recommended by each side. The candidates are selected by the chairmen of the two associations to fill the positions with experts. According to the person in charge of the association speaking to reporters, the Chinese side has already asked Li Shengbo, Wang Fuli, and others to take on the responsibilities after consulting with Zhou Zuomin. The Japanese side will be selected after Kodama returns to his country. Japan, within China's borders, utilizes the rights and interests in its treaties and has widely established yarn factories in Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places. In recent years, it has expanded even more, and there is a significant repression of China's weak textile industry. With this cooperation, jointly researching and developing production, China's textile industry may have a glimmer of life.

Ogura Comes Again

The New Sound News Agency reports that Kodama and others originally represented the country's financial groups, and their wills were not in line with the Japanese military department. The military department does not fully support them, so Sumitomo Bank Managing Director Ogura Masatsune, who is close to the military department, and his advisor Teranishi, will continue to come to China for inspection after Kodama. However, the schedule has not yet been determined and must be decided after Kodama arrives in Tokyo to report.

### Gao Yuzhu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Organizing a Southwest Miao Yi Investigation Team

Ms. Gao Yuzhu, representative of the petitioning people and Tusi of the southwestern border Yi ethnic group, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after petitioning the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and remaining in Beijing to connect with officials and people from all walks of life to discuss the development of transportation and culture in the border areas. She will stay for ten days and then take the route through Hunan and western Hunan to return to Guizhou, Yunnan, Xikang, Sichuan, and the border areas of various provinces. The reporter of the Shenzhou News Agency visited Gao at her residence yesterday. According to her, this time she personally represented the people of the southwestern border areas to petition in Beijing. Mr. He Yaojian and other members of the Central Committee raised the issue at the Third Plenary Session, and the conference attached great importance to the case, which shows that the central government cares about the development of culture and transportation in the border areas. The Central Propaganda Department has already decided to send personnel to conduct investigations and studies, and the International Photographic Society will also send people to accompany them to photograph the scenery of the Yi and Miao people in the border areas and introduce them to various places. At the same time, the Central Propaganda Department will transport educational films to be screened. Other agencies such as the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission have also decided to send people to inspect the Yunnan-Guizhou border areas afterward. The biggest purpose of this trip to Shanghai is to discuss with leaders from all walks of life to organize an investigation team, because the border areas are vast, and although the central authorities have paid attention to the development work, if there are non-governmental organizations cooperating, the future benefits will be significant. It is best if a Southwest Yi Miao Investigation Team can be quickly formed here to accompany the delegation to conduct a thorough investigation of the party affairs, politics, military affairs, economy, and education in the southwestern border areas, and to study the humanities, geography, and products of the Yi and Miao people. It is hoped that all sectors will make efforts to promote it. Regarding the development of Yi Miao education, a plan has also been agreed upon. Children of Tusi will come to study in Beijing and Shanghai, which can be realized in a few months. When she comes to Beijing and Shanghai again in half a year, she will bring a large number of Tusi to visit. As for the areas with more Yi Miao people and lagging culture in the border areas, such as Lijiang, Tengchong, Simao, Wenshan, Zhaotong, and other places in Yunnan, as well as Jianchang in Sichuan and Bijie in Guizhou, Yi Miao education will also be vigorously promoted to achieve universality.

### Japanese Wharf

The Warehouse Management System - Implementation Cannot Be Delayed Any Further

The Central News Agency reports that the Japanese shipping companies' refusal to implement the dock warehouse management system, which has resulted in illegal incidents such as smuggling and violence by Japanese and Korean ronin in this city, has already attracted the attention of Chinese and foreign personnel. In order to understand the process of the Japanese shipping companies' refusal to implement the management system, the Central News Agency reporter asked the relevant parties about this yesterday. It is said that before the dock warehouse management system was implemented, illegal incidents such as replacing inferior goods with superior goods were often found in all un-customed goods in the docks and warehouses, which greatly affected tax revenue. In view of this, the Customs Bureau formulated the management measures and implemented them in April of last year, and the Ministry of Finance approved the allocation of 500,000 yuan annually as regular expenses, and recruited and hired 300 tax police to take turns guarding various grinding stone warehouses day and night to prevent illegal incidents from occurring again. Shipping companies from countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy all expressed their approval for this and implemented it simultaneously before April of last year. However, the Japanese shipping companies have consistently refused to implement this management system. The Customs authorities have repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese shipping companies, but to no avail. According to the Japanese shipping companies, there is no clear provision in the Sino-Japanese treaty for the implementation of the dock warehouse management system, expressing a firm refusal. The Customs authorities believe that shipping companies do have an obligation to help the Customs guard un-customed goods to prevent illegal incidents from occurring, and continue to send personnel to negotiate with the Japanese side. After a year, there has been no result. Therefore, the Customs authorities believe that the repeated occurrence of smuggling and violence by Japanese and Korean ronin is due to the Japanese shipping companies' refusal to implement this dock warehouse management system. The Customs authorities believe that after the smuggling and violence incident by Japanese and Korean ronin on the morning of the 27th, the implementation of this management system in the Japanese dock warehouse area cannot be delayed any further.

### Various Public Organizations Express Condolences to Injured Customs Officers

After the smuggling and violence incidents by Japanese ronin in this city occurred repeatedly, the public has paid great attention to this. It is learned that various public organizations have sent representatives or letters to express condolences to the injured in recent days. As for the injured customs officers, except for Ma Zilian, who was the most seriously injured and is still receiving treatment in the hospital, the other eight people have been discharged from the hospital and returned home for treatment.

### Ministry of Finance Appoints Chairmen of Three Banks

### Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Telegraphs to Stop Tax-Exempt Foreign Rice from Entering Guangdong

Guangdong Province Has Sufficient Food Supply - No Need to Rely Solely on Foreign Rice

The Bean and Rice Guild and the Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Guild jointly telegraphed President Chiang of the Executive Yuan yesterday, saying, "We have learned from Hangzhou that the Executive Yuan will send a letter to President Chiang, saying that our country had a great harvest last autumn, and various production areas are shipping their surplus grain to Guangdong. Guangdong Province has no shortage of food. The key to the high price of rice in Guangdong is the low exchange rate of the Guangdong currency. If the Guangdong currency can be raised, the price of rice will naturally be stable. The associations have stated this in a telegram last month. Recently, we read in the newspaper that Guangzhou's telegram on the 24th said that the central government has approved 2 million dan of foreign grain and foreign rice to enter Guangdong tax-free. According to the telegram from the Guangdong Gang, the tax exemption for foreign rice will be implemented on the first day of next month. The news came and shocked the markets. We have learned that there are about 1 million dan of rice waiting to be shipped to Guangdong in Shanghai, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other places. Moreover, the harvest of early rice in Guangdong Province is not far away. According to the current situation, Guangdong Province has more than enough food supply and does not need to rely solely on foreign rice, which will cause a great blow to the national economy. We sincerely request that you uphold the established national policy of complete tariffs and rural revitalization and strongly oppose the proposal to import foreign rice tax-free. The national economy and people's livelihood all depend on it. With the utmost sincerity, we await your orders." Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Guild and the Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Guild, and Lu Shide, Chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains Guild, respectfully express their gratitude.

The Shanghai Museum and the Shanghai Branch of the China Aviation Construction Association, colleagues, because Section Chief Li Dachao of the Municipal Government must accompany Chairman Wu to Guangdong that day, the parting song was sung in a hurry, and they were very reluctant.

### Anhui Rural Representatives Leave Shanghai for Anhui Tomorrow

New Tea Enters the Market to Handle Lending - This Trip to Shanghai is a Complete Success

Sun Fuxian and Xu Maoqing, representatives of the Rural Cooperative of Taiping County, Anhui, came to Shanghai to seek assistance from relevant organizations in order to improve green tea manufacturing and promote foreign sales. After successful negotiations, as the new tea is about to enter the market, they are scheduled to return to the county tomorrow to handle lending in order to transport and sell it abroad. The China National Goods Maintenance Association in this city sent a letter to the county magistrate of the county yesterday, requesting assistance. The details are as follows:

Complete Negotiations and Return to the County to Collect Tea

Taiping County, Anhui, is a famous green tea production area. Due to manufacturing adhering to traditional methods and sluggish sales, the rural economy has declined. Representatives Sun Fuxian and Xu Maoqing were specially sent to Shanghai to seek assistance from relevant organizations. The China National Goods Maintenance Association acted on their behalf to submit the situation to the National Economic Commission, the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Office, and the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, and all replied that they would assist. After many days of efforts by Representative Sun, this business has been successfully negotiated. Mr. Sun is scheduled to return to the county tomorrow to start lending and collecting tea because the new tea in the county is about to enter the market. According to reports, after coming to Shanghai to seek assistance from all parties, it has been successfully negotiated. Because the new tea in this county will be available in mid-next month, I need to return to the county urgently to start lending and collecting tea in the mountains. It is expected that we will first contact tea merchants to organize a statistical transportation and sales promotion association to organize the reform of manufacturing methods and lending and tea collection. If the processing is completed, in addition to dumping it to various places in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, we will also seek excellent quality to pack and sell it to overseas locations in order to recover the reputation of tea.

Maintenance Association Letter to County Government for Assistance

The China National Goods Maintenance Association in this city sent a letter to the county magistrate of Taiping County, Anhui yesterday, requesting that a spacious and suitable location be designated for storage. The original letter said, "We respectfully inform you that Taiping County, Anhui Province, has always been famous for its tea, but it has failed to make progress due to adhering to traditional methods. Moreover, due to the small amount of production, the sales are not wide, and it is unknown, which is regrettable. This time, our association followed the request of Sun Fuxian and Xu Maoqing, representatives of the Rural Cooperative of Taiping County, and entrusted us to submit the situation to the National Economic Commission, the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Office, and the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, requesting substantial assistance. Afterwards, we have received replies agreeing to the request, which is deeply gratifying. Now that the new tea is about to enter the market, Representative Sun must soon take technicians into the mountains to lend and collect tea. However, the concentration of tea leaves must have a spacious address for storage, and the latest methods must be used to process it exquisitely, so that it is suitable for sales and transportation abroad, so that it can achieve the effect of promoting foreign sales and enriching rural areas. We hereby send a special letter to inform you, and we implore your honorable county magistrate to base on the ultimate intention of benefiting the rural areas and assisting industry, and approve the designation of a spacious and suitable location to facilitate the progress. We cannot express our hopes and prayers enough, and we also ask for a reply."

### Social Affairs Bureau Orders Xin Yu Factory Workers to Resume Work

Factory Plans to Start Work Tonight

The Da Gong She reports that regarding the labor dispute at Xin Yu Yarn Factory Nos. 1 and 2, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday ordered the workers to resume work first, dismiss the labor dispute, and await mediation. The factory is scheduled to issue a notice to start work tonight. The workers have also issued a statement saying they are unwilling to resume work until the authorities provide a guarantee of livelihood. Details are as follows:

Social Affairs Bureau Approval: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued document number 830 from the Municipal Division yesterday, stating: "Regarding the petition submitted by Xu Peixing and other workers of the Second Xin Yu Textile Factory, requesting that the company be stopped from dismissing a large number of workers, we have received and reviewed the petition. The Bureau convened a mediation session on March 26, but it could not proceed because the company representative arrived late. In addition to further investigation and scheduling another mediation session according to the law, all 56 dismissed workers, including Wang Shibiao, should be temporarily reinstated to work. The remaining workers must resume work within a set period of time and await mediation." This approval is dated March 27, Republic of China Year 26. Director Pan Gongzhan.

Preparing to Start the Machines: The Second Xin Yu Yarn Factory at 8 Rue Robert, and the First Xin Yu Yarn Factory at 37 West Suzhou Road, upon learning that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau had ordered the workers to resume work, worked overnight to repair the machines. They originally planned to start work this morning, but because it was Sunday, they decided to take a day off as usual. Therefore, it was decided that the factory would officially start night work at 6:00 PM today. The factory also instructed the foremen of each department to notify the workers to come to work.

Workers' Statement: Representatives of the workers of the two Xin Yu factories issued a statement to the Da Gong She reporter yesterday, stating that the labor dispute was caused by the factory dismissing 12 workers for no reason. After the Municipal Party Headquarters sent personnel to mediate, the dispute had come to an end, and the workers were working peacefully in the factory. Unexpectedly, the factory suddenly submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau on March 16 to dismiss 47 people, including Xu Peijin. While the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was convening a mediation session between labor and management on March 21, the factory intensified its actions and violated the principles of mediation (i.e., during the mediation period, the company shall not dismiss any more workers, and the workers shall not strike or slack off). On March 24, the factory successively dismissed as many as 56 workers and posted a notice, causing panic among all the workers. Representatives were sent to negotiate with the factory on the basis of reason, but to no avail. The next morning, when the day shift workers came to work, the factory locked the machine rooms and hired a large number of detectives to forcibly expel the workers. During the chaos, Huang Shaohua, the personnel section chief of the factory, held an unlicensed pistol and fired at the crowd, and directed staff and hired thugs to beat the workers and pour boiling water on them, causing more than ten workers to be injured. The unlicensed pistol was seized by the workers and submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters for forwarding to the Songhu Garrison Command for verification. The facts are all there and need no further argument. It is believed that all sectors of society are aware of this. Now the factory says "workers are slacking off" and then "workers are striking," and also falsely claims that all the workers brought sticks and destroyed the manager's office and bedrooms. Considering that the factory first locked the workshops and refused to allow the workers to work, who should be responsible? How can it be equated with slacking off or striking? Distorting the facts, it is hoped that all sectors of society will not be misled and will uphold justice.

### Silk Weaving Factory Workers' Wage and Treatment Conditions Mediated Yesterday

A general meeting of more than 500 workers was convened at the May 30th Public Cemetery, and efforts were made to persuade them. As for the Jin Sun and Yun Xia factories in Nanshi, the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday ordered the First District Silk Weaving Industry Union to order the workers to resume work as soon as possible and await mediation in accordance with the law.

### Soviet Embassy Hosted Farewell Banquet for Xiao Zhenying Yesterday

The Soviet Embassy in China hosted a farewell banquet at the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai on the Bund yesterday afternoon for Xiao Zhenying, a member of the Hebei Provincial Government, who will be going to Europe for observation.

### Convenient Long-Distance Telephone Calls

Ministry of Communications Stipulates Measures - To be Implemented from May 1

For the convenience of long-distance telephone calls to the called party, the Ministry of Communications has stipulated measures, which were instructed to the local telephone bureaus for reference and implementation, and are scheduled to be implemented from May 1. They are copied as follows: ㊀ When the calling party requests a long-distance telephone call, if the called bureau knows that the called party has a telephone installed and does not need to send a messenger to call, it should first directly call the telephone installed by the called party. After the called party answers the call, it should be changed to a calling person call. However, if the telephone installed by the called party cannot be called, a messenger should still be sent to call. ㊁ When the calling party requests a messenger call, if the called bureau does not know that the called party has a telephone installed or knows that a telephone has been installed but the call cannot be made, a messenger should still be sent to call. If the called party's residence is near a telephone that can be borrowed to receive long-distance telephone calls, the called party should copy down the notification number and the name of the calling place upon receiving the notification slip, and write the telephone number of the installed telephone or the borrowed telephone on the back of the notification slip, requesting the telephone bureau to connect the long-distance call to that telephone number, such as "Please connect to telephone number XX for conversation." The notification slip should still be returned to the telephone bureau by the original messenger, and immediately go to the place where the telephone is installed to report the following information to the long-distance desk of the telephone bureau: ㊀ Notification number, ㊁ Calling place name, ㊂ Caller's name, and ㊃ Telephone number of the telephone used. The telephone bureau will verify the three items ㊀, ㊁, and ㊂ and connect the call to facilitate speed.

Xuan Sheng Mining Case

### Mao Yonghu, Wang Zhensheng, and Others Appeal to the High Court to Investigate Evidence

The Fourth Trial on the 25th, Further Interrogation Indefinite - The Reasons for the Appeal are Lack of Evidence and False Accusation

Regarding the case of the murder of Japanese national Xuan Sheng Kuangzuo, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau previously arrested the criminals Mao Yonghu, Wang Zhensheng, Jin Daoquan, Zhu Guisheng, Chen Enming, Zhao Yunhong, etc., and sent them to the local court. The two prosecutors, Tang Ruxiu and Lei Binzhang, prosecuted them for murder and endangering public safety. The collegial panel, composed of presiding judge Cai Dingcheng and associate judges Li Xuedeng and Shao Qinzhi, heard the case and appointed lawyers Yu Chengxiu and Shi Qinghua to defend them. After the sentence was pronounced, the defendants refused to accept it and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, and appointed lawyer Yu Chengxiu as their defense lawyer, who agreed to handle the case free of charge. After the appeal, the court opened again this month on the 25th (fourth trial). The trial concluded that further investigation of evidence from the Shanghai Police Bureau and the Jiangdu County Government was required, and the retrial was postponed. The reasons for the appeal by lawyer Yu Chengxiu are excerpted below: In the case of the appeal against the charges of murder and endangering public safety, I am submitting additional reasons for the appeal. I respectfully submit that this case has been tried by your court several times. Now I will continue to state the reasons for disagreeing with the original judgment as follows:

A. Regarding the cause of death of Xuan Sheng Kuangzuo: It has been verified that the deceased Japanese national Xuan Sheng Kuangzuo was identified by the original judgment based on the autopsy report of Dun Gongkuan, a doctor at Fumin Hospital, and his statement that the death was caused by a gunshot wound. I would like to state the following: ㊀ The original trial determined that Xuan Sheng was shot to death by the seized .32-caliber revolver. According to common experience, there must be a sound when a bullet is fired from a handgun. Even according to the report on the Xuan Sheng case by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, it was believed that the reason for using automatic handgun bullets in a revolver was that the sound was smaller (see page 5 of the comparative observation of this case and the Zhongshan Xiuxiong case). Even if this inference is true, it can be seen that firing live ammunition from a revolver is not completely silent. However, the people who were at the scene at the time, such as Sun Zhongshan (the first person to see Xuan Sheng fall), Wang Qiping (the person who passed by on a bicycle), and Mian Kuanren (the person at the apartment window), all stated unanimously that they did not hear any gunshots. Sun Zhongshan and Yu Qiping should have heard the gunshots. Even Mian Kuanren should have heard the gunshots, as determined by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's report. Sun Zhongshan's hearing was not defective and was even tested (see the Shanghai Public Security Bureau report). However, they all stated that they did not hear any gunshots. Therefore, whether Xuan Sheng died from a gunshot wound and whether he was shot to death by the seized revolver, which made a sound, is questionable in fact. ㊁ According to the principles of reason, a person who dies from a gunshot wound must have a wound and bloodstains. Although the original trial determined that Xuan Sheng died from a gunshot wound, Dun Gongkuan's autopsy report also stated that there were bleeding wounds and swelling under the skin. However, according to the statements of people who were at the scene at the time, such as Sun Zhongshan, and Liu Houkun and Chen Longquan, the drivers who took Xuan Sheng to Fumin Hospital, they all said that they did not see any bloodstains at the time. Therefore, whether Xuan Sheng suffered a wound from a gunshot and died from the wound is not without doubt. Moreover, according to the statement of Chen Longquan, the driver who took Xuan Sheng to Fumin Hospital, he transported Xuan Sheng from the scene to Fumin Hospital in his car. However, there were no bloodstains in the car, and there were no bloodstains on the clothes of the Japanese woman who was holding Xuan Sheng. Therefore, where did the photos of bloodstains on the ground at the time of the incident, which were cited by the original trial and taken by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, come from? Whether they are human bloodstains in the first place, and if they are human bloodstains, whether they belong to Xuan Sheng's bloodstains, cannot be determined without testing based on a single photo. ㊂ According to the autopsy report, Xuan Sheng was shot and the bullet entered from the back. According to this situation, if Xuan Sheng fell to the ground because he could not withstand the injury, he must have fallen forward. However, the facts are the opposite. Xuan Sheng was lying on his back. Considering the situation, whether Xuan Sheng's fall to the ground was due to a gunshot wound needs to be investigated in detail. At least, it is necessary to determine whether the situation of a bullet entering from the back and a person lying on their back is possible from a scientific standpoint. In addition, the bullet entered from the back, the person fell on their back, and there was no blood flowing from the wound. Is there anything more contradictory than this? ㊃ According to the autopsy report (see the inspection report submitted by the Public Security Bureau), the external examination of Xuan Sheng's body showed that there were bruises on his left shoulder and right elbow. Where did these injuries come from? They have nothing to do with the gunshot wound. It is necessary to investigate whether Xuan Sheng had a fight with others or whether he fell due to the severity of the injuries. The original judgment only recognized that Xuan Sheng died from a gunshot wound and paid no attention to the other injuries. The facts of the case were not clear. Based on the above reasons, although the autopsy results of Xuan Sheng Kuangzuo's death indicated that it was caused by a gunshot wound, there are many doubts in reality, which are still difficult to explain. In addition, Xuan Sheng died within the jurisdiction of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, while the so-called scene of the incident was within the jurisdiction of the original trial court. However, the prosecutors of any court were not notified to conduct an inspection in accordance with the law, and the identification was based on a Japanese doctor's autopsy report. How can it be convincing?

B. Regarding the seized handgun: Regarding Xuan Sheng's death, the original trial determined that it was shot by the seized .32-caliber square-wheel handgun. However, ㊀ Xuan Sheng's death occurred on July 10, 1936, while the handgun was seized on September 18 of the same year. There was a distance of two months and eight days between them. If the handgun was the murder weapon, the murderer would have calmly destroyed it during this period. Why would he leave it there and wait to be seized before confessing freely and allowing others to seize it as evidence? ㊁ The so-called location where Xuan Sheng was shot was on Dixiwei Road, while the location where the handgun was seized was on Hujia Muqiao. The distance between the two is relatively far. If the seized gun was the murder weapon, the murderer would have fled in a hurry after the murder, fearing that it would be too late. How could he calmly go to a distant place to hide the gun? Otherwise, after the murder, no one would have found out. If he wanted to destroy the murder weapon, he could have destroyed it at any time. However, he had to carry it to the more distant Hujia Muqiao, push away the garbage, and hide it under the bridge, attracting the attention of the general public and increasing the danger himself. This is not allowed by reason. ㊂ Moreover, according to the autopsy, Xuan Sheng's death was due to a gunshot wound, and it was identified that an automatic bullet was fired from a .32-caliber revolver. Although the seized handgun is also .22-caliber, since it is not an automatic handgun, how can it be determined that this gun is the murder weapon that killed Xuan Sheng? Moreover, it was determined that Xuan Sheng was shot to death by the appellant Wang Zhensheng with the seized handgun, which is based entirely on speculation. How can it be convincing? Based on the above reasons, whether Xuan Sheng's death was due to a gunshot wound is still impossible to determine. Even if it is assumed that he died from a gunshot wound, whether the seized handgun was the murder weapon is still subject to investigation. Moreover, the handgun is a revolver, while the bullet is not the same type. According to the original trial's determination, the murder weapon has been changed three times. Then the murderer is determined to succeed, but why would he load other types of bullets into different types of handguns and fire them? The doubts between them need to be clarified. The original trial only determined it based on the possibility of firing, which is also considered to be not fully investigated.

C. Regarding the identity and responsibility of the murderer: It has been verified that the original trial determined that the appellants Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng were the principals, the appellant Jin Daoquan was an accessory, and the appellants Zhu Guisheng and Chen Enming were accessories before the fact. I would like to state the following: ㊀ The reason why the original trial believed that the appellants should bear criminal responsibility was based on the so-called confession. According to the confession, it must be a free statement and must be consistent with the facts. The statements of the appellants in the Shanghai Public Security Bureau were actually obtained through torture. Judging from the situation of the successive statements, which were contradictory and inconsistent, it can be determined that they were not from the heart. Moreover, Zhao Yunhong, a co-defendant, was said by the Public Security Bureau to have written a confession in his own handwriting. However, when the case was reviewed, the meaning was inconsistent before and after, and the important points were even cut off. Therefore, what is the evidentiary value of the so-called self-written confession? Attention should be paid to it in the conviction. Moreover, not all of the appellants Mao Yonghu and others have a confession, do they? Moreover, the so-called confession of the appellants all stated that the murder plan was made in the Renhe Hotel, specifying the date. Whether the appellants held a closed-door meeting in the hotel on that day can be checked in the hotel's record and identified by witnesses. However, the original trial did not investigate it and said that the confession was consistent with the facts. In fact, the cause of Xuan Sheng's death and the murder weapon used for the shooting are still doubtful. It is too hasty to put people to death based on this kind of confession. ㊁ Confessions that have evidentiary value are limited to those that can be proved by facts. If they are words of evasion and shirking responsibility among co-defendants, then according to the rules of evidence, they cannot be easily adopted. In this case, the appellants Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng were pushing each other on the point of implementation. According to previous precedents, this kind of statement of mutual evasion cannot be adopted and regarded as the only evidence. ㊂ This case is a serious murder case. The body was not inspected by the court in charge. There are many doubts about the injuries and murder weapons. The witnesses cannot clarify the situation of the incident (see the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's inspection report). The appellants believe that the appellants are the murderers, and there is no positive proof. How can the original trial determine the crime based on the so-called contradictory confession? ㊃ Moreover, according to the testimony of the Japanese woman Bei You Masha and others, Xuan Sheng had no enemies before his death. It seems that there is no other person who killed Xuan Sheng except the appellants. Regardless of what kind of force this kind of reasoning has, it can be said that the report of the autopsy of Xuan Sheng clearly stated that there were injuries on his left shoulder and right elbow. If there were no enemies, where did the injuries come from? Since there were injuries, how can it be determined that there must be no enemies? Therefore, even the facts of this kind of speculation in the original trial cannot be maintained. Then the results inferred from this cannot be credible either. ㊄ The cause of the crime is part of the facts of the crime and should be determined based on evidence. The original trial determined that the appellants' murder was instigated by Hua Kezhi and others in order to cause serious diplomacy. How Hua Kezhi and others instigated it cannot be recognized without any evidence. Moreover, the so-called murder to cause serious diplomacy was also imagined in the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's report (see the conclusion of the report). However, this is still just a presumption. The appellants are all Chinese nationals. Although they have not received advanced education, they know that in this serious national crisis, at least they must love themselves and love the country. How dare they seek temporary pleasure and give the country and society endless worries? Therefore, the original trial did not ask for evidence and immediately determined that they murdered in order to cause serious diplomacy, which is difficult to convince. ㊅ Based on the above points, it cannot be proved that the appellants are the murderers. Moreover, when the incident occurred, Sun Zhongshan and Wang Qiping either saw Xuan Sheng fall to the ground or passed by Xuan Sheng's side. Since they saw the victim, why didn't they see the murderer? Even based on the testimony of the Japanese woman Nakamura, who said that she met a Chinese person at the time, this person cannot be considered the principal offender, which was determined by the Public Security Bureau (see the report's conclusion that the facts are not credible). Even if he is considered the principal offender, how can he be forcibly designated as the appellant? ㊆ As for the evidence and statements obtained from the appellant Jin Daoquan, he only had dinner with the appellants Mao Yonghu and others once. He did not participate in the murder at all, and there was no discussion about murder during the dinner. Regardless of whether the appellants Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng are the principals, it is still subject to investigation. The appellant Jin Daoquan's accidental presence at the dinner should not be responsible for the crime. If it is said that they gathered to discuss murder at the dinner, and it was not implemented, it is also considered to be complicity and should be punished according to the aider. However, the so-called complicity is punished according to the accessory, but the spirit of legislation is still based on whether there are facts. Assuming that they discussed murder at the dinner, the appellant Jin Daoquan had neither the act of encouraging the crime nor the

### Express Train Crushed a Person to Death at the Northeast Entrance of the Sun Temple Yesterday Morning

Oiler Zhu Huichuan Died Tragically - Raincoat Caught in the Engine and Torn in Two at the Waist

The express train from Shanghai to the capital on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was traveling at the northeast entrance of the Sun Temple at 8:30 yesterday morning. Zhu Huichuan, a 28-year-old Nanjing native, was standing next to the railway at the site, working as a locomotive oiler at the McCaughan Road Station, waiting for the express train to pass. Unexpectedly, the train came speeding along at a higher speed, and the strong wind caused Zhu's raincoat to be caught by the No. 379 locomotive, dragging him into the track, crushing him in two at the waist, and breaking his hands. The flesh and bones were shattered beyond recognition, and he died on the spot. After receiving the news, the station dispatched railway police to take care of the aftermath and notified the local bailiff to report the incident.

### Extraordinary Confession in Arson Appeal Case of Russian

Accomplices Recant and Shift Blame; Possibility of Arson Device Evaluated

In October of last year, Chief Inspector Bai Naituo, Detective Feng Zhiming, and others from the General Inspectorate of the General Police Station, learned that several warehouses in the concession had been set on fire to fraudulently claim insurance money. The fires had a similar pattern, so they immediately launched an investigation and apprehended suspects: Russians Bao Liwei, Ke Nele, Ao Peile Pan'ersi Gan, Li Weisi Gan, Wei Sigan, and Xi'er Xuhuo, among others. They discovered that these individuals used cunning methods, first purchasing fox tails worth four or five hundred yuan in Tianjin and other places, then shipping them to Shanghai to be auctioned by Louis Moore Auction House. They deliberately inflated the price to six thousand yuan and bought them back. Based on the auction house's price list, they insured the goods for six thousand yuan with a fire insurance company. The goods were stored in warehouse of Longmao Foreign Firm at 77 Guangdong Road. They secretly packed arson tools and flammable liquids into boxes so that the fire would start automatically in two or three days, allowing them to collect the insurance money. After being sent to the First Special Court for trial, Bao Liwei was sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment, Li Weisi Gan to two years and two months imprisonment, and Ao Peile Jian'er Si Gan to one year. Ke Nele and others were also sentenced separately. It is now learned that Bao Liwei and others, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyer Li Zhongwen to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the Higher Court. They claimed that they had been doing business in Tianjin and came to Shanghai after closing down. They met a Russian named Ke Jingge, who persuaded them to set up a scheme to defraud insurance money, taught them the methods, and offered to manufacture the arson device. Before the plan could be implemented, Ke Jingge suddenly died of illness. Later, they met Ao Peile Pan'ersi Gan, who strongly urged them to continue the plan. Only after being arrested and sentenced did they learn that Ao Peile Pan'ersi Gan was actually an accomplice of a Russian detective. The detective had learned that the deceased Ke Gejin had plotted a fraudulent scheme without success, so he lured them in, both to report to the Russian detective and to conspire together. When the arson device was sent to the warehouse, the detective had already laid an ambush to arrest them. He thought that after solving the case, he could go back to the insurance company to claim a reward. Unexpectedly, he was also sentenced, so he revealed the whole story. Moreover, the arson device that was confiscated was actually incomplete and could not start a fire. It was only intended to entice the appellants to commit crimes so that he could obtain the reward. Now that Pan'ersi Gan has also been sentenced, he has exposed the situation. Therefore, the appellants cannot accept the original verdict and request that the original judgment be revoked and that the appellants be declared innocent. After the Higher Court conducted an interrogation, the attorney Gan Jingxian of the Public Works Department argued that there was nothing wrong with the original judgment and requested that the appeal be rejected. Criminal Judge Yu Hua questioned the appellants in detail about whether the confiscated arson device was actually capable of starting a fire and whether it was necessary to have it appraised. He then ordered the appellants to be detained and await a retrial.

### Cheng Linsheng Sues Zhao Nailin, et al. Seeking to Rescind Contract

Relates to a Debt Claim of Over 70,000 Yuan; Lawyer Xu Yi and Wife Present in Court

Cheng Linsheng, a native of She County, Huizhou, who was formerly a major landlord in this city, founded the Gentai Harmony Flour Mill and appointed his wife's younger brother, Li Quanshen, as the manager of the mill. Xu Yi, Li's nephew-in-law, was practicing law in Shanghai at the time. Li hired him as Gentai's legal counsel and occasionally asked him to handle mill affairs. Xu had a younger brother named Xu Yiming, who ran Rongxingkang Coal Company. Because his elder brother and the mill owner Cheng Linsheng and manager Li Quanshen were all relatives, whenever he had financial difficulties, he would borrow postdated checks from Gentai to cope. Later, Gentai also suffered from insufficient deposits, and the postdated checks were returned. From then on, the Xu brothers, along with Cheng Linsheng, Li Quanshen, and Xu Yi's wife, Zhao Naixue's father, Zhao Pei (i.e., Zhao Guisheng), were involved in repeated lawsuits due to financial entanglements, accusing each other and each having wins and losses. Xu Yi was sentenced to eight months in prison and has now been released after serving his time. However, his wife Chen Naixue and wife's father Zhao Pei have now been sued by Cheng Linsheng, who hired lawyer Li Lin, to the First Special District District Court, claiming that the pledge agreement for all the property and decorations and three copper tripods of the Yuantai Paper Mill held by Zhao Naixue was signed under duress and requesting a judgment to rescind the contract. The copper tripods, property ledgers, and other items occupied by them should be ordered to be returned. Furthermore, the transfer of the debt claim of over 70,390 yuan made by Zhao Pei on behalf of his fictitious Zhonghe Bank was illegally transferred by Xu Yi, Xu Yiming, and others for various complex reasons. Zhao Pei has no debt claim at all and should be declared invalid for this transfer act, and the two defendants should bear the litigation costs. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji opened the court for interrogation. Cheng Linsheng had gone to his hometown in Huizhou and was represented by lawyer Li in court to state the intention of the prosecution. The statement mostly involved the facts of the various lawsuits that the two parties had filed against each other over the years. He said that Cheng Linsheng did not deny that he owed debts to outsiders, but he never owed Zhao Pei and Zhao Naixue's father and daughter any debts. The transferred debt claims and property pledges obtained by the father and daughter were both illegal and should not be recognized. He requested that the original complaint be judged as such. The defendant Zhao Pei claimed illness and did not attend. Only Zhao Naixue and her husband Xu Yi turned themselves in. According to Naixue's statement, the two contracts mentioned above had already been signed and sealed by the plaintiff, so they were legally valid. How could they be overturned at will? Judge Xu then ordered that a date be set for the pronouncement of judgment.

### Anhui Gang Robber Cheng Yizhen Arrested Yesterday

### Tu Guanshou and Li Shenshi Sue to End 12 Years of Cohabitation

Death of Older Brother Does Not Affect Lawsuit; Recovering IOU Does Not Destroy Evidence, Compensate Money

Tu Guanshou, the younger brother of Tu Zhongshu, a doctor of Chinese medicine residing at 17 Linde Lane, Fangbang Road, is over forty years old and works in the typesetting department of the Commercial Press.

Twelve Years Ago

He became acquainted with Li Shenshi, a widow from Jiashan, also known as Tu Shenshi, and began cohabitating at 31 Qiujia Lane in the South City. This woman is already forty-one years old this year, a fading beauty. Because of this, Tu remarried another woman, Qian, as his wife on July 13th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Shenshi was furious upon hearing this news and threatened

Lawsuit as Retaliation

Tu Zhongshu, knowing that his younger brother was in trouble and feeling brotherly affection, took on the role of mediator. An agreement was made in which Tu Zhongshu acted as guarantor, paying twelve yuan per month. Unexpectedly, by the end of last year, Tu Guanshou owed Tu Shenshi 295 yuan in alimony. The woman hired lawyer Cheng Zhengping to file a lawsuit in the District Court against Tu Guanshou and Tu Zhongshu, seeking to jointly pay the sum. Tu Zhongshu received the summons,

Both Angry and Anxious

And actually died. Tu Guanshou, because his older brother had died, was unwilling to compromise. After the court's ruling, the death was ruled not to affect the lawsuit, and Tu Guanshou was still ordered to pay the full amount, and a declaration of provisional execution was made. However, now Tu Guanshou always feels that his elder brother's death was caused by being harmed by the woman's lawsuit, and he is unwilling to rekindle the happy relationship with the woman. Therefore, he hired the woman's lawyer to sue Li Shenshi, also known as Tu Shenshi, and her stepson, Li Hengliang,

To End Cohabitation

And Stepfather-Son Relationship. According to the claim, he had cohabitated with the woman based on matchmaking, and Li Hengliang was only eight years old at the time. Loving the house, he cared for him as he grew up. Until the purchase of the Yongfa祥 Cigarette and Paper Shop at 96 Xiaopuduqiao in the South City in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he handed it over to Li Hengliang to manage. Unexpectedly, the mother and son harbored ill intentions, and on January 23rd of the 23rd year, they seized the property for themselves, driving out the stepfather and forbidding him from entering. Two months later, he learned that Tu Shenshi had another lover surnamed Xu, and her son had recognized another stepfather. Because of this, the plaintiff lost his wife,

And Had No Choice but to Remarry

Qian, and was informed that she wanted to sue for blackmail, writing out a monthly alimony of twelve yuan, guaranteed by his brother Zhongshu. Then she demanded that the plaintiff marry a wife for Hengliang, only needing to pay a severance fee of 500 yuan, so that the stepson could marry a wife, and then she would sever the relationship with the plaintiff. Therefore, he first paid 300 yuan and also paid 196 yuan to the Dafugui Restaurant for Hengliang's wedding. At the same time, he received the IOU for 12 yuan per month, which was handed over to his brother, believing that from then on

The Entanglement Has Been Cleared

But his sister-in-law was on good terms with Shenshi, and she secretly handed it over to her. This gave rise to the previous lawsuit, which caused his brother's death. Please judge to end the relationship. But Tu Shenshi still hired Cheng Zhengbai as a lawyer to countersue, saying that the plaintiff's statement was nonsense. Since she had received the IOU, why didn't he destroy it, but it still fell into her hands. Therefore, she requested a one-time payment of alimony for 13 years, totaling over 1,800 national currency, etc. Yesterday, Judge Wei Zhifen summoned both parties to study the case. The statements were different, and the court 諭 adjourned the hearing to another day.

### Tai Shuangqiu and Hu Peizhen Marry Today

The wedding of Mr. Tai Shuangqiu, Dean of the Education College of Great China University, and Ms. Hu Peizhen, is scheduled to take place at 1:00 PM today at the China Arts and Crafts Society on Aimei Yuxian Road in this city. Mr. Li Denghui will be the witness, and Mr. Wang Zhengting and Qian Xinzhi will be the introducers. The wedding ceremony will be quite unique, as noted below:

Transfer Ceremony to Aid Education

According to Mr. Tai, the amount of money donated to social causes by transferring a birthday ceremony for parents is limited. However, marriage is something that everyone must go through, and the number of people is large. If the ceremony can be transferred to aid social causes, the amount will be very considerable. All the gifts received by Mr. Tai this time will be donated to the Minsheng Education Society and the Nian'i Movement Promotion Association as elbow room for developing their undertakings.

Casual Wedding

Mr. Tai is the advocate of the Nian'i Movement. He usually wears short clothes made of homemade cloth. For this wedding, some people advised him to wear a long gown and mandarin jacket to comply with the central government's regulations. After careful consideration, Mr. Tai believes that compliance with etiquette should also be considered on a case-by-case basis. If there is a grand ceremony in the country, then it is necessary to wear it. If an individual is getting married and has financial difficulties and cannot afford to purchase it, and must comply with the etiquette, then many couples will not be able to get married because of this. Moreover, rural people work hard all year round, and preparing this kind of clothing is of no other use other than for weddings, which is wasteful. As for those who have no economic problems, long gowns and mandarin jackets are certainly acceptable. The reason why Mr. Tai decided to have a casual wedding this time is to advocate for society.

Simple and Grand

Although the intention of this wedding is extremely grand, the ceremony is quite simple. The hall's decoration includes only the party and national flags, the portrait of President Sun, and the Nian'i Society flag, with few other items. The usual veils, colored hangings, and candles are all omitted. The only hospitality for guests is tea and snacks, with no banquet.

Using Local Goods

According to the regulations of the Nian'i Movement, local goods should be explored as much as possible. It is heard that the raw materials for the dress worn by Mr. Tai at today's ceremony are improved local cloth made by the Nian'i Society of Xujiazai in the Minsheng Education Experimental Zone of West Shanghai for the upper body, and old blue rural cloth for the lower body. Ms. Hu wears Hangzhou Juchang祥 Raw Silk blue satin clothing and Zhanghua-produced呢overcoat, and does not perm her hair. According to Ms. Hu,土silk is also a local product, and the Nian'i Movement has not rejected it. Moreover, the Nian'i Movement booklet does not stipulate absolute wearing of 土goods.

### Seizing Dung is Like Seizing Rice Bowl; Villagers Deny Beating

Li Chunlin Suffers Immediate Loss; Injury Has Been Verified and is Difficult to Deny

The dung drainage in the Zhangjiabang Qiangjiajiao area of ​​West Shanghai Caojiadu has always been handled by the villagers on a daily basis. There are no cleaning stations. On the 15th of this month, Li Chunlin, the manager of the cleaning station, went to prevent the villagers from picking up dung, so the farmers Zhao Yaozhong, Zhao Futing, Zhao Jianyuan, Zhao Hongzhou, Zhao A'wu, Zhao Xiutang, Zhao Tingzhou, Zhao Wenzhou, Zhao Qingzhou, Wang Jinfa, Zhang Minsheng, etc. felt that the cleaning station's seizure of their dung drainage was like seizing their rice bowl, so they beat Li Chunlin and used dung shovels to hit his head and poured dung juice on his head. Just as they were in an inextricable situation, the local police station learned of the incident and sent police to the scene to round up all the rioting farmers. Li Chunlin was covered in dung and slightly injured. He was immediately escorted to the police station and transferred to the District Court, where the defendants were detained and publicly prosecuted on charges of assault. Yesterday, Judge Ji Xuedeng opened the court for trial. The defendants hired lawyer Fang Gang to argue that there were no dung trucks in the countryside, so the pits and toilets were full of dung and had to be cleared by carrying them on shoulder poles. This could not be compared with the special city. Now, the plaintiff has overstepped his scope and is competing with farmers for profit, so the villagers argued with him, and there was no beating or making him taste the dung drainage. The official said that Li Chunlin's injury had been verified and there was no need to deny it. He immediately announced the end of the debate and will pronounce the verdict at the end of the month.

According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, the Consul General’s Police Department, considering that recently businesses operating Turkish massage parlors decorate their entrances with alluring lights, attracting the curiosity of passersby, but the interiors lack proper facilities and are actually aimed at prostitution, thus disrupting public morals, has begun investigating business operations from the 11th of this month. Among them are those operating without the permission of the Consulate, or those operating under the names of foreigners. For example, at No. 60 on Laobazi Road, upstairs, four women are employed as assistants, engaging entirely in prostitution.

### The Problem of the Shanghai Municipal Council Increasing the Municipal Surtax

— Ying Chun

Due to financial difficulties, the Shanghai Municipal Council decided to increase the municipal surtax by 2% from July 1 this year, to 16%. This was opposed by the majority of Chinese, but to no avail. It was finally passed by a vote of six to five in the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council the other day. All those who voted against it were Chinese directors, which shows the consistency of the Chinese members’ actions. However, it was ultimately defeated by one vote: it means that the citizens in the concession area of the city will increase their burden.

According to another source: the land tax rate in the Public Concession will also increase at the same time, from 7/1000 to 8/1000.

In terms of the city’s population ratio, it goes without saying that the Chinese account for the absolute majority. The brunt of these two tax rate increases will naturally fall on us Chinese. Therefore, we cannot remain silent on this matter. In recent days, the local public opinion has already reflected this, which further shows that people completely disagree with this tax increase.

As far as we know, this tax increase comes from the old affairs of 1927. At that time, in order to increase from 14% to 16%, there was a strike that lasted for a month. Later, Mr. Yu Qiaqing came forward to mediate before it was settled. Unfortunately, the solution at that time was still not very thorough (the solution was to increase the “extra tax” of 2% until 1930). Therefore, in less than a few years, the Shanghai Municipal Council has brought up the old matter again.

Generally speaking, as long as the municipal tax is increased reasonably, and as long as the citizens are not unable to bear it, it will naturally not cause great difficulties. However, in this year, most of the households are living in a recession. Due to the impact of the economic panic, a large number of people have gone bankrupt. Some who can barely maintain it also feel very painful. Since it is already difficult to maintain, then how can they pay taxes? Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council itself must also think from a larger perspective and consider the difficult situations of the general households. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council also has its own unavoidable difficulties, such as an annual overdraft of five million, which is indeed a difficult amount to plan for. However, there are many other solutions, such as cutting spending, etc., which is also a way to make up for it. Why not slightly reduce the salaries of many redundant staff and senior staff, and always plan on the residents? I heard a year ago that the salaries of senior team members and low-level Chinese staff would be reduced, but it has not yet been implemented, while the proposal to increase taxes has already been shaking in our ears.

Although this proposal has already been approved by the board of directors, the opponents among the citizens are still actively proceeding in the hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities will cancel the original proposal. Whether from the perspective of reason or emotion, we should agree with the opposition. Because even if all the merchants and citizens bow their heads and obey, and there will be no more strikes, why should the clear-sighted people “drink poison to quench their thirst” and strip away these last few remaining "hairs" in a commercially declining situation?
