### Sichuan Gentry Claim They Have Not Received Disaster Relief Funds; Ministry of Finance Has Sent Telegrams to Investigate

Rumor That Sichuan Provincial Government Appropriated Disaster Relief Funds and Ordered Tax Offices to Borrow Funds as Compensation, Causing Panic Among Disaster Victims

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance recently received a telegram from Sichuan gentry Shao Mingsheng, Yin Zhongxi, and others, stating that they had not yet received the disaster relief funds, which was extremely surprising. The Ministry sent a telegram to investigate. It has been learned that the original telegram from the Ministry stated that the one million yuan in public bonds allocated by the Ministry for Sichuan disaster relief was delivered to the Relief Committee on April 6 for collection, verification, and distribution. More than a month has passed, but the telegram claims that not a single penny has been received, which is very surprising. It is requested to inquire directly with Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Committee, to ascertain the truth, and reply by telegram for verification. The Minister is deeply concerned about the Sichuan disaster. Even while traveling, he repeatedly inquired about the disaster situation and the state of rainfall, and his heart is filled with anxiety beyond words. Recently, considering that the funds raised from various places were slow to meet the urgent need, he telegraphed the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China to advance 300,000 yuan to handle disaster relief in Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces to alleviate the urgent situation. Saving lives in a disaster is like putting out a fire, and no delay is allowed. If the previously allocated relief funds have not yet been distributed, which agency is delaying it? Please report immediately by telegram for investigation, etc. It is also reported that the emergency disaster relief funds for Sichuan Province, one million yuan in public bonds, were allocated by the Ministry of Finance in early April and handed over to the Relief Committee to send personnel to Sichuan Province to be distributed by the Sichuan Provincial Government. However, it is now heard that the Sichuan Provincial Government announced that the funds had been distributed clearly, but also ordered various counties to obtain funds from the tax inspectorates in various districts for offsetting. However, all districts claim that the disaster situation is extremely severe and tax revenues are short, and no funds can be allocated for the time being, so the relief funds have not been secured, causing extreme panic among the disaster victims. The Central Government considers disaster relief funds as urgent as fire, so it quickly organized relief efforts last time, hoping to benefit the disaster victims as soon as possible and provide assistance. Now, the Sichuan Provincial Government has appropriated disaster relief funds and ordered tax inspectorates in various districts to borrow funds as compensation, which is slow to meet the urgent need, and seems to have disregarded the Central Government's benevolent intentions and the plight of the disaster victims. It is hoped that the Sichuan authorities will find a way as soon as possible to ensure that the actual benefits can be extended to the disaster victims. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)

[Chongqing] The Chongqing Sichuan Disaster Inspection Team was originally scheduled to depart in three routes, east, south, and north, on the 20th. Due to the organization not yet being ready, the departure has been postponed. The disaster situation in counties near Chongqing seems to have been slightly alleviated due to rain in succession. Cao Zhongzhi, the Ministry of Finance's special supervisor for relief disbursement, is scheduled to depart on the 21st to survey various counties on the southern route. Cao attended a banquet of the Press Association on the 20th, saying that the Sichuan disaster is extremely severe, and he hopes that all sectors will fully support disaster relief. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)

[Chengdu] Ren Ke-cheng, Supervising Commissioner of Yunnan and Guizhou, came to Sichuan to supervise the disbursement of relief funds by order of the Supervisory Yuan and the Relief Committee. He departed from Kunming on May 7 via the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway, passed through Guizhou, arrived in Chongqing on the 18th, went west from Chongqing on the 19th, and arrived in Chengdu at 3:00 PM on the 20th. According to Ren, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces have made significant progress in military administration and construction in recent years. Yunnan Province, under the leadership of Chairman Long, has made particularly effective efforts to move forward. Guizhou Province's highway construction has made considerable progress with the support of the Provisional Headquarters. The National Government has officially appointed Xue Yue as the concurrent Chairman of Guizhou, and there are infinite hopes for the progress of political affairs and the development of construction in the future. He came here specifically to supervise relief efforts, and all of the central government's relief funds allocated to Sichuan will be distributed to the severely affected counties in the next few days. He will stay in the province for a short time and then go to the severely affected counties to survey the disaster and supervise relief efforts, and plans to return to Yunnan to handle the affairs of the supervisory office in about ten days.

[Tianjin] Most knowledgeable Japanese in North China are pessimistic about the future of Sino-Japanese relations. Younger officials, seeing the unstable domestic political situation and the uncertain policy towards China, believe that this has caused China to look down on them. The military has no ability to grasp the center of the situation in North China. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that Japanese influence will retreat altogether. At the meeting of consuls in North China in Tianjin on the 21st, younger diplomats will make proposals to urge the upper and lower levels of the country to pay attention. (Special dispatch, 20th)

### Shigeru Yoshida Receives New Instructions, Anglo-Japanese Negotiations to Begin Again

Tokyo Newspaper Discloses Contents of Japanese Proposal, Japan Eager for Funds and Plans to Borrow from Britain

[Nanjing] Diplomatic circles report that the issues involved in Anglo-Japanese talks seem to be very complex. Initially, it is not just the Far East issue. Matters such as commercial markets and the disarmament conference, as reported outside, are all being discussed. As for the Far East issue, it should also be a major part of the talks. The Japanese side seems to express its deep attention to the Far East economy. However, observing the progress of the talks and the situation on all sides, the British side has not yet shown any intention of moving towards coordination with the Japanese side. The British side has always had different views from the Japanese side, so the future may not have concrete conclusions. (Special dispatch, 20th)

[Tokyo] The coronation ceremony of the King of England has passed. It is reported that Yoshida, the Japanese ambassador to Britain, received instructions issued by Foreign Minister Sato a week ago and will begin formal negotiations with Meade, the assistant undersecretary of the British Foreign Office. According to the Japanese newspapers, the main parts of the Japanese plan in the preliminary Anglo-Japanese negotiations before the coronation ceremony of the King of England include mutual recognition of the spheres of influence of the two countries in China. This morning's main headline of the Mainichi Shimbun was "Our North China - British Central and South China." The newspaper also disclosed Sato's instructions, saying, "Based on the same spirit as the already abolished Anglo-Japanese Alliance, realize Anglo-Japanese compromise in China, that is, mutual respect for vested rights. Britain recognizes the existence of 'Manchukuo' as an established fact and Japan's special relationship with North China. Japan will fully understand and accept Britain's existing progress in Central and South China. Therefore, a so-called 'friendly agreement' will be established." It is reported that the basic premise of this friendly agreement is that Japan declares that it has no territorial ambitions towards China. However, when the Central News Agency reporter asked the spokesman of the Japanese Foreign Ministry about the above news, the answer was that the negotiations in London have not made such rapid progress, and he avoided answering when formal negotiations will begin. According to the opinions of foreign observers here, it is extremely difficult to formalize any political agreement between Britain and Japan, especially an agreement that stipulates a re-division of spheres of influence in China, because this will seriously damage China's sovereignty, which Britain is currently unwilling to do. They believe that rather than re-dividing spheres of influence in China, Britain hopes that Japan will decisively not damage China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Furthermore, they express skepticism about the tasks that Yoshida can undertake, given the military's control over Japan's policy towards China. Rumors that Britain and Japan would jointly provide financial assistance to China have become illusions. According to today's news, Japan is now seeking a large-scale credit loan from Britain, mainly for raw materials and heavy industrial products. Japan is in great need of this loan because it lacks overseas gold reserves. Regarding this point, Yoshida may raise it when negotiating with Cardigan, but if there is a possibility of realization, it will be handled by Muno Jukuro's economic mission.

### British Ambassador Clive Leaves Japan to Return Home

Sato Hosts Farewell Banquet

[Tokyo] British Ambassador Sir Clive left here with his family this afternoon. Japanese Foreign Minister Sato and others went to see him off. The Duke of Burgundy is scheduled to take the "Canadian Empress" to England on Friday morning, and then go to Bijing to take up his new post. The newly appointed British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, will not be able to arrive here until September. Japanese Foreign Minister Noda held a banquet to bid farewell to the Duke of Burgundy. All newspapers took the opportunity of the Duke of Burgundy's departure today to speculate on the nature of the preliminary talks between London and Japan to reconcile Anglo-Japanese relations. Several newspapers, including the Yomiuri Shimbun, said that Japan would recognize Britain's special status in Central and South China, and Japan would cooperate with Britain to provide financial assistance to China in exchange for Britain's recognition of Japan's special interests in North China. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has firmly denied this news. According to the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, the talks in London to adjust Anglo-Japanese relations are indeed in progress, but they are not sacrificing the interests of third parties. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Denies Lending from Britain

[Tokyo] While Japan and Britain are adjusting their relationship, some people spread the rumor that Japan will recently raise debts in Britain. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities still deny this, saying that there is no such fact. However, this year Japan's trade has shown a considerable increase in imports, so it continues to transport specie to foreign countries. At the same time, Britain is also trying to increase its exports, especially when Peng Bido came to visit last time. With the understanding of each other's relatives and old friends, Britain hopes that Japan will increase its purchases of British goods. Therefore, depending on how the friendly relations between Britain and Japan develop in the future, it may purchase necessary items such as machinery from Britain. It is not entirely impossible for Britain to grant Japan a credit loan. However, on the British side, given today's international political and economic situation, there are naturally various considerations. Even in Japanese financial circles, it is believed that obtaining credit from Britain is actually harmful and unhelpful, given Japan's current economic situation, and opposition is very strong. Therefore, whether this matter can be materialized is doubtful. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 20th)

### Prince De Calls Meeting to Discuss Expansion of Puppet Army

Li recently sent people to various roads in northwestern Chahar to recruit bandits. Cheng Guorui, a staff officer of Li's department who went to the Rehe border to recruit bandits, has returned to Zhangbei. (Special dispatch, 20th)

[Beiping] Liu Guitang's puppet bandit army stationed in Dage, Fengning, and Li Shouxin's department stationed in the second and fourth districts of Guyuan, Chahar East, have been ordered to concentrate in Zhangbei and Shangdu via Daqinggou from their original locations.

[Guihua] It was reported in the Pingjin newspapers on the 17th that puppet bandit troops were discovered in Honggertu.

The outside world reported that the news was not issued by Sui, so it is not entirely reliable. (Special dispatch, 20th)

### National Handicraft Exhibition Opens in Beijing

Wu Dingchang Discusses Improvement Policies; Welcomes Criticism from Visitors

[Nanjing] The National Handicraft Exhibition officially opened on the 20th at the National Art Gallery. The opening ceremony was held at eight in the morning. Attendees included Wu Dingchang, Zhou Yichun, Chen Diexian, Li Zuyu, all staff members of the National Economic Construction Council Exhibition, representatives from various provinces and cities, and all members of the Qingdao Industrial Observation Group, totaling about two hundred people. After Chairman Wu Dingchang presided over the ceremony, Wu delivered the opening speech, stating, "The opening of the National Handicraft Exhibition today is a cause for celebration. In recent years, both the government and society have advocated for the promotion of handicrafts to develop rural subsidiary industries. Our country's handicrafts developed the earliest and have a long history. However, descending to the present day, while there are many that are exquisitely made and worthy of promotion, those that adhere to old methods and are crudely made are also everywhere to be seen. If we do not think of revitalizing them, it will be even more difficult to revive them in the future. However, our country is vast and the types of handicrafts are numerous. If we were to go to each place and each industry to study and guide each item, it would not only be time-consuming and costly, but it would also feel fragmented and difficult to achieve the rapid effect of a comprehensive review and widespread improvement. Therefore, we have specially organized this exhibition to gather handicrafts from all over the country in one place, for general consumers to compare and observe, and to accept criticism, research, and guidance from experts, and to find ways to improve them." Wu then described the principles he holds for improving handicrafts: "1. For products that have the value of being sold at home and abroad, we should strive for excellence and immediately implement methods to promote sales. 2. For those that are practical and already beautiful, we should guide the producers to make rapid improvements. 3. For those that can only meet local needs and have no value for external sales, we should also clearly instruct the producers not to overproduce, so as not to waste effort." In the end, he expressed, "With utmost sincerity, we welcome visitors to offer as much criticism as possible, provide active guidance, and hope that provinces and cities will quickly organize groups to visit Beijing, so as to learn from each other. I deeply believe that this National Handicraft Exhibition will achieve great results, so that our country's handicrafts will improve day by day, and the rural economy will develop day by day." After Wu's speech, Chen Diexian and Li Zuyu delivered speeches in succession. The photo session was completed at nine o'clock. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)

### Three Countries Jointly Maintain the Balance of Power in Central Europe

— Li

During the coronation of the King of England, top diplomats from European countries, such as French Foreign Minister Delbos, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, Czech Prime Minister Hodza, Foreign Minister Schmidt, and British Foreign Secretary Eden, gathered in London for several diplomatic talks. Although the content of the talks has not been fully disclosed, it is generally speculated that the main topic was how to prevent the active activities of Germany and Italy in Central Europe. Yesterday, news came that representatives from the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union had formed an oral agreement in Paris to jointly maintain the balance of power in Central Europe. It can be seen that the previous diplomatic talks have had concrete results.

The so-called balance of power in Central Europe was created by the Treaty of Versailles. Its territory includes Austria-Hungary and the Little Entente countries, which are located to the east of Germany and Italy. It is a must for the two countries to contend for hegemony. After 1936, in order to break the unfavorable international environment, these two fascist sister countries deeply felt the need to temporarily abandon their confrontational state and jointly develop their power. Therefore, on the Italian side, in July of last year, it first wooed Germany and Austria to conclude the German-Austrian Agreement. In October, it concluded an agreement with Germany alone. In November, it convened a meeting of Italy, Austria, and Hungary in Vienna. This year in March, it also concluded an agreement with Yugoslavia, dispersing the unity of the Little Entente countries. On the German side, it has tried its best to use the South German Party to actively operate in Czechoslovakia, to organize millions of Germans so that they can leave Czechoslovakia and join Germany at any time. At the same time, it has sent a large number of Nazi Party members to Yugoslavia and Romania to organize pro-German fascist governments. This spring, political talks were held between Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary to eliminate mutual isolation and promote friendly cooperation. Especially noteworthy is that German Aviation Minister Goering visited Italy three times in January, March, and May this year to talk with Mussolini. Foreign Minister Neurath visited Rome in May.

The development of the combined forces of Germany and Italy in Central Europe is a major threat to international peace. It is easy to attract the attention of the world. The British Times and the French Le Jour have successively released shocking news. The former said that the purpose of the German Foreign Minister's visit to Austria in March was to plan the annexation of Czechoslovakia. The latter said that Germany and Italy had secretly agreed to divide Austria. In addition, there was the saying that Germany and Italy had concluded a military agreement, which was widely circulated at the time. Although these rumors have been officially denied by the German and Italian authorities, "there is no smoke without fire" and "there is always a reason for it."

Under this situation, the countries of Central Europe have no choice but to make plans for self-defense. Czechoslovakia is the first target for Germany's eastward advance geographically. Politically, it is also the Little Entente country closest to France. It is naturally most sensitive to the expansion of German power. Although Austria has been wooed by Italy and has concluded an agreement with Germany, it cannot but be wary of the extension of German and Italian power. The visit of the Czech and Austrian diplomatic envoys to the United Kingdom this time clearly implies a request for help from the United Kingdom and France. From the perspective of their own interests, France and the Soviet Union have the need to guarantee the balance of power in Central Europe. As for the United Kingdom, it has always been unwilling to make any guarantees for Central Europe. Now that it has seen the expansion of Italian power already threatening the interests of the United Kingdom itself, it seems that there is no room for hesitation on the issue of Central Europe. From the above-mentioned various situations, the result of the recent diplomatic talks in London is that the three powers of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union have formed an oral agreement to cooperate to maintain the balance of power in Central Europe. In any case, this is of great significance for the future of international peace.

### Unprecedented Spectacle in British Airspace: The New King Reviews the Navy

Silver Medals Awarded to Senior Officers from Various Countries; 277 Ships Participate

[London] King George VI of England reviewed the Navy in Spithead today, which is one of the coronation celebration ceremonies. 277 ships participated, divided into eight rows, starting from Spithead in the east and ending at Cowes in the west. From submarines to the latest battleships, from yachts to postal ships, all forms are available. Among these 277 ships, there are 160 warships, including representative ships from foreign countries. It is truly a maritime spectacle in British history. When the royal yacht carried the King and Queen through the fleet, all the ships fired cannons to pay tribute, and the cheers shook the sky. The bands on each ship played the national anthem in unison. As the Changyu yacht advanced with its drums in its twelve-mile voyage, cheers from each ship rose and fell, constantly along the way. The weather was fine today, and the number of people who came to watch the naval exercises was estimated to be no less than one million, gathering at Nanhai Waiite Island and Portsmouth. All the hotels in Spithead were full, so thousands of people spent the night on the beach last night. After dawn, thousands more came by car and train. The Princess Elizabeth of the Palace got up early in the morning, ran and played on the deck of the Victoria Royal Yacht, and watched the rows of warships, seeming interested. After a while, the King also went to the deck and walked and talked with his daughter. The princess later went to the pier next to the boat and asked about the warships. Lord Mountbatten, the King's naval adjutant, answered each question in detail. At half past ten, the King received the Secretary of the Navy, the commanders-in-chief of each fleet, senior officers, and captains of foreign warships and representatives of merchant ships on the boat. The King awarded coronation silver medals to senior officers of each foreign warship. After that, the King and Queen, and the Duke of Kent and others, went ashore to inspect the Nelson flagship Victoria. The Duke of Gloucester and his wife also arrived shortly after. Naval personnel presented souvenirs to the members of the royal family. The Queen and the Princess Elizabeth each received a brooch, with a small model of the Victoria flagship made of metal. The Queen put it in her handbag, while the princess pinned the needle on her chest. The Queen also received a small paper cutter with a model of the Victoria. The princess also received a small booklet containing the history of the Nelson flagship and the Battle of Trafalgar. After leaving the Victoria flagship, the King and others went to a nearby room to visit the full map of the Battle of Trafalgar hanging on the wall. When the Queen left the room, she praised the painting, saying that it was a very interesting and very beautiful painting. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 20th)

### Amidst Calls for the Japanese Political Parties to Overthrow the Cabinet, Prime Minister Lin Talks About Constitutionalism

Japan Has Its Own Unique Politics; Declares No Intention to Exercise Dictatorship

[Tokyo] The Japanese political situation is becoming more tense due to the cooperation of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, which express their opposition to the Lin Cabinet. At this juncture, Prime Minister Lin talked about his state of mind and political views in the Minister of Education's office yesterday afternoon as follows: It is said that the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have jointly resolved to overthrow the cabinet. Although this is something that the political parties cannot avoid, if things such as conflicts between the government and the political parties occur, it will only make the political situation unstable. Therefore, I hope to avoid conflicts between the two parties as much as possible. When political parties were most developed in Japan, the so-called constitutionalism dictated that the majority party would form the cabinet, while the minority party would attack the cabinet in the opposition. This phenomenon was influenced by Western democratic constitutional politics. I firmly believe that Japan should implement unique constitutional politics. The so-called unique constitutional politics does not mean dictatorial politics. Therefore, I do not deny the form of constitutional politics today. I hope to avoid conflicts between liberalism and excessive reformism from the standpoint of being a judge. As for the policy, it will not be forced through the parliament. If there are parts that should be changed as a result of parliamentary deliberations, they will be revised, or they may be proposed again. In this way, it is necessary for the government and political parties to examine national affairs with a serious attitude without sticking to foreign political forms. (Domei dispatch, 20th)

### Harmonizing the Three Major Problems in Europe is Quite Laborious

The UK, France, Germany, and Italy Still Have Many Differences; the UK is Willing to Support Central European Economies

[London] Some time ago, the King of England held a coronation ceremony, and dignitaries from various countries came to celebrate and took the opportunity to hold diplomatic talks with the US authorities. According to responsible sources, the topics discussed in this diplomatic talk were mainly the Western European Convention issue, the Central European issue, and the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact issue. The results of the discussion proved that the United Kingdom and France held completely consistent views on various events. A summary is as follows:

Both the United Kingdom and France advocate that the Western European Convention should be related to the League of Nations Covenant. However, Italy and Germany advocate that the new system to ensure the safety of Western Europe should take the form of joint control by several major powers and should not be linked to any collective security system. Since the views of the two sides are so different, the British side is very skeptical whether they can be harmonized so that the Western European Convention can be established. Therefore, after German Defense Minister General Blomburg held talks with the British authorities, his attitude was quite pessimistic. As for the Central European issue, Czech Prime Minister Hodza, Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt, Yugoslav First Regent Prince Paul, and other dignitaries from Central European countries all believed that the United Kingdom and France’s solemn declaration on safeguarding Austrian independence was inappropriate, because the United Kingdom and France had a determination to respect and safeguard Austria's territorial integrity, which was well known to Italy and Germany. If a declaration is issued again, it will not only be useless, but will also cause unfavorable reactions from Rome and Berlin and create new factors of turmoil in Central Europe. Therefore, the United Kingdom is now only preparing to support any proposals to the Danube countries that aim at economic cooperation in the Danube River basin, especially the economic cooperation plan of the Danube countries proposed by Czech Prime Minister Hodza. Once the countries concerned adopt this proposal, Sir Richard Lee, the economic advisor to the British government, may be ordered to go to Central European countries to provide technical assistance to the United Kingdom's economic construction plans in the Danube River basin.

Regarding the issue of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact, the statement issued by French Prime Minister Blum and Foreign Minister Delbos after talking with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov in Paris yesterday was based on the principles agreed upon by Delbos and Foreign Secretary Eden in London some time ago. What are these principles? That is, under the current situation, although the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact should not be strengthened, it should not be weakened either, because the United Kingdom and France adopt a cooperative attitude towards various political issues in Europe. If the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact is strengthened, the British autonomous regions may be concerned that the United Kingdom bears a certain nature of restraint on the Soviet Union and panic will occur. Conversely, if the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact is weakened, it may be considered to be a concession to Germany's demands, which is also unreasonable. Therefore, both should be avoided.

### Austrian Foreign Minister Visits France, French Foreign Minister Arrives in Brussels

German Defense Minister Welcomed in England, Hungarian Regent Hosts Italian King

⊙Brussels: French Foreign Minister Delbos arrived here this afternoon and will hold talks with Belgian Prime Minister Janson. Local newspapers commented on Delbos's visit, believing that it would not lead to any surprising developments, as Belgium's international status had already been determined after the joint declaration issued by Britain and France on April 24. However, all newspapers hope that the meeting between Delbos and Janson can pave the way for the early signing of the Western European Pact. It is said that the Western European Pact is currently the goal of Belgium's foreign policy. (National Maritime Telegraph, 20th)

⊙Brussels: Prime Minister Janson hosted a luncheon at his private residence for French Foreign Minister Delbos. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, French Ambassador to Belgium Laroche, Assistant to the Political Affairs Department of the French Foreign Ministry Massigli, Private Secretary Rosat, and Secretary-General of the Belgian Foreign Ministry Rosenhoff were also present.

[Paris] Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt, after arriving here from London, held talks with Foreign Minister Delbos today. A communiqué was issued afterwards, stating only that both countries had the same opinions on all issues related to both parties. (Havas News Agency, 19th)

[Paris] Sources at the French Foreign Ministry stated that Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt's visit to France was largely a matter of international courtesy, with the aim of emphasizing the extremely good cultural and economic relations between France and Austria. Schmidt's meeting with Delbos was necessary to clarify the situation in Central Europe. France deeply understands the difficulties faced by Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, who is striving to maintain a balance between Berlin and Rome, while also attempting to protect Austria's own independence without hindering commercial relations with Germany and Italy. This kind of handling is truly not easy. As for the issue of adjusting relations between Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, according to French political figures, it is best handled jointly by the League of Nations and Britain and France, as Britain, France, and Italy have a "Tripartite Declaration" guaranteeing Austria's independence. This declaration is sufficient to resist all external pressure on Austria, and the spiritual support of Britain and France for Austria is extremely valuable. (National Maritime Telegraph, 20th)

[London] German Defense Minister General von Blomberg yesterday visited military schools and army exercises. Today, he went to southern England to visit the Andover military air station.

He then mentioned the Rome Protocols, stating that the constructive political ideas of the protocols not only promoted the welfare of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, but also promoted cooperation with Germany, and successfully laid the foundation for true and lasting peace. King Umberto then gave a reply, expressing his deep gratitude for the sincere and cordial atmosphere and the enthusiastic welcome displayed by the Hungarian people during his visit, which would further consolidate the friendly relations between the two countries. (National Maritime Telegraph, 19th)

[London] A telegram received here today from the Hungarian capital stated that when King Umberto III of Italy and Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in Budapest, the residents gave them a grand welcome, and the authorities held a military parade for them. However, one of the viewing platforms along the way collapsed due to overcrowding, killing and injuring 56 children. (National Telegram, 19th)

[Rome] The Badano Post published a commentary stating that what Count Ciano will discuss is the issue of Italy acting as a mediator between Yugoslavia and Hungary. As for the purpose of the mediation, it is to facilitate the resolution of all outstanding issues between Yugoslavia and Hungary since the end of the European War and the establishment of the Little Entente, especially the issue of the Hungarian minority within Yugoslavia. As for the relationship between Romania and Hungary, it will only be discussed after relations between Italy and Romania improve. In addition, Count Ciano will also discuss the issue of Hungary's rearmament, which was originally opposed by the Little Entente, but in light of the new situation in Europe, it may no longer be opposed.

### U.S. Special Envoy Speaks on British Rearmament

Sufficient to Guarantee Peace

[London] Gerald, the U.S. special envoy participating in the coronation ceremony of the King of England, recently gave a speech here. British Secretary of State for War Cooper, Lord Derby of the House of Lords, and the Archbishop of Canterbury were all present. He said that British rearmament "is truly the greatest guarantee of world peace." When asked whether "calling an international conference can eliminate the scourge of war," he replied, "The obstacles encountered in international trade, and other various difficulties, are all sufficient to brew war, without any doubt. It is urgent to convene an international conference to eliminate them. Now is the time. But at this moment, to convene a large-scale international conference is precisely enough to provoke all sorts of demands and disputes, so we cannot rush things. We must wait until a certain country, after exhausting its wealth and resources, is trapped in revolution and famine, and is willing to cooperate with us sincerely to seek peace, then it can be done."

### President of Southern Ireland Warns League of Nations

Hopes All Countries Will Join

⊙Dublin: The Dáil Éireann of the Irish Free State recently discussed the case of the Free State sharing the expenses of the League of Nations. Executive Council President de Valera immediately gave a speech, expressing disappointment and encouragement, roughly saying, the effectiveness of the League of Nations has already been somewhat doubtful. "The incidents it has encountered are all sufficient to shake its foundation. If its internal crisis is not eliminated, then the Irish Free State, for its own interests, may declare its withdrawal from the League. It is not necessarily impossible, but I hope this will not happen. Although the League of Nations can greatly comfort all small countries in the world with great hope, for the sake of the League of Nations itself, it is appropriate for all countries in the world, especially all countries in Europe, to join." (Havas News Agency, 20th)

⊙Dublin: Executive Council President de Valera of the Irish Free State further defended the reason for Ireland's non-participation in the Imperial Conference held in London this time, saying, "First, we really do not want to be in the same position as in Ottawa in 1932, and allow British ministers to consider us as people who cannot keep our word." de Valera also said, "Previously, when the Irish delegation went to Ottawa, while still en route, the British government levied taxes on Irish agricultural exports. At that time, the Irish delegation should have immediately left Ottawa, but unfortunately, being in the position of guests of the Canadian government, it was inconvenient to leave abruptly. What is being discussed at today's Imperial Conference is of course related to the Irish state, but there are many matters that are even more closely related to domestic affairs. If the fundamental issues are not resolved first, the status of the Free State will be misunderstood, and there will be no possibility of true cooperation." (Reuters, 19th)

### Origin of Floating Corpses in the Hai River, Tianjin

Corpses are all Drug Addicts or Coolies. The Causes of Death are Extremely Tragic and Unbearable to Hear. Three Main Culprits Who Abandoned the Corpses Have Been Arrested.

Tianjin Correspondence: Regarding the case of floating corpses in the Hai River, since the 3rd Detective Team of the Police Bureau arrested the corpse disposal criminals Kong Zhao Yuan and Yang Xiang at 3:00 PM on the 8th of this month at the North Vegetable Market, Zhakou Street, along the Hai River concession area, and also arrested one corpse that was not yet dead. According to the confession of the two criminals Kong and Yang, they were hired by the Bai Mian Guan (opium den) of Xinde Foreign Firm on Zhakou Street in the Japanese concession to carry this corpse that was not yet dead to the riverside, but were arrested before they could escape. According to the confession of the corpse that was not dead, named Jia Rongqi, he was addicted to opium and lived in the Xinde Foreign Firm in the Japanese concession for more than half a month. Now, because he had no money to satisfy his addiction, he could not survive, so Xinde Foreign Firm hired someone to carry him to the riverside, and so on. After this case was solved, the case of floating corpses can be said to have obtained a portion of the truth, that is, those who use opium in the Japanese concession, once they have no money to satisfy their addiction, and their addiction flares up and they cannot move, the opium den will hire someone to carry them to the riverside. However, according to the precise examination by the forensic doctor of the Tianjin Local Court Procuratorate, among the more than one hundred floating corpses previously discovered, there were also strong men who did not use drugs, and those who had suffered iron or wooden injuries. This proves that drug users are a portion of the floating corpses, and those strong men who did not use drugs and those who had suffered iron or wooden injuries must have another kind of hidden story.

At 3:00 PM on the 17th, when police detectives were patrolling near the telephone bureau on Zhakou riverside in the Japanese concession, they saw two strong men abandoning a patient who looked like a coolie there. The detectives immediately stepped forward to arrest them. As a result, one person escaped, and one was caught. After being taken to the police bureau for interrogation, he confessed his name was Meng Yuantan, 30 years old, and he was instigated to carry this patient to the riverside by the Da Dong Company in the Japanese concession (Da Dong Company is an organization that handles the registration of coolies leaving the pass, taking photos, and selling so-called "entry permits"). The patient who was carried in was still able to speak and claimed his name was Bai Dongpu, 30 years old. He came to Tianjin from his hometown of Cang County, Hebei Province, to seek a living a few days ago and was misled by others to work outside the pass. Unexpectedly, before he could leave, he became seriously ill and was carried out and thrown by the riverside by two people. It was also learned that coolies who were found to have diseases or who discovered they had been deceived and were unwilling to go were often drowned in the river using this method. After this case was solved, it can be proven that the floating corpses previously salvaged were the same as the Jia Rongqi case for those with drug addiction, and the same as the Bai Dongpu case for those without drug addiction. This is another part of the truth about the case of floating corpses in the Hai River. However, who pushed the corpses into the river from the riverside has not yet been solved. For this reason, at 6:00 AM on the 18th, the Tianjin Municipal Police Bureau's detective team, based on a tip from informants, arrested three more main culprits who moved the corpses. One was He Sihai, 74 years old, from Tianjin County, Congshui (i.e., those who manage the salvage of floating corpses in the river), one was Tian Yuanxiu, 50 years old, from Tong County, Hebei Province, Zhakou riverside area (i.e., those who manage the burial of those who die on the road), and Tian Diangong, 25 years old, is Tian Yuanxiu's nephew. At first, they firmly denied having abandoned corpses in the Hai River, but after the witness Zhang Qifa was brought in for confrontation, they confessed without hesitation. According to the three criminals, they have been working in the water and land areas for more than ten years, responsible for salvaging, reporting inspections, and burying corpses. Upon investigation, the types of corpses on the riverside were drug offenders (those with the same situation as Jia Rongqi) and coolies (those with the same situation as Bai Dongpu). When they were first discovered, they all followed legal procedures to report to the Tianjin Local Court Procuratorate for inspection, and on the one hand, they asked Xilaogongsuo Shicaishanshe for coffins. The reporting inspection fee, guarding the corpse at night, corpse fee, and carrying and burial fees cost about one yuan per corpse. This amount was routinely collected from nearby shops. Lao Zhongji Hardware Store and other businesses on Zhakou Street donated a few corners of money each time. After deducting expenses, there was still a surplus profit. Later, because too many corpses were discovered, either one or two per day, or five or six, the materials from Shicaishanshe were no longer able to meet the demand, and soliciting money also became annoying after a long time, and no one gave it anymore, and going back and forth to the court for inspection was exhausting, and there was no profit at all. Out of desperation, every night, they borrowed a bamboo pole from a nearby boatman named Zhang Qifa (i.e., the witness in this case) (a tool for pushing boats, one end with iron nails) to insert into the anus or armpit of the corpse and drag it into the river in order to shirk responsibility and save trouble. A few days ago, Zhang Qifa, because he found this matter too tragic, was unwilling to lend the bamboo pole again. They then purchased a bamboo pole themselves and, since implementing it, have dragged 84 corpses into the river. After they were salvaged in the Dazhigu area of the Hai River, the corpses that had become swollen were mostly dragged in last winter or this spring, and those whose faces were lifelike were dragged in in the last two or three days or three or four days. The iron or wooden wounds on their bodies were caused by the collisions of the bamboo pole nails during the dragging, and so on. The police detective team then transferred the entire case, along with the confessions, to the third section for handling that night. The origin of the floating corpses in the Hai River has now been revealed. (19th)

### Continued Investigation of the Yang Case

Hankou Correspondence: The Wuchang District Court continued its investigation hearing at 9:00 AM on the 18th in the First Tribunal. The various suspects in the Yang assassination case were examined. Military police guarded the inside and outside of the court, the same as the previous day. The spectator seats were full. At 9:00 AM sharp, Presiding Judge Liu Xianji, Associate Judges Wang Zhaoji and Yue Shutang, Clerk Shuai Gujing, and Prosecutor Zhu Chengzan arrived at the court. Attorneys Wang Zhaoxiang, Xie Shengkan, and others also attended on time. At 9:05 AM, the Presiding Judge ordered Cao Bingrong to be brought to the court. Two bailiffs led him into the courtroom. Cao wore a short blue jacket and gray pants. He appeared to have a limp in his right foot while walking. The Presiding Judge then announced the opening of the hearing. According to Cao Bingrong's testimony, he was 29 years old, from Xingren, Guizhou, residing on Xizi Street in Hankou, and had previously worked as a soil dealer. The Presiding Judge asked, "Are you Zhang Jiayi?" Cao Bingrong answered, "Yes." "Are you a member of the China Youth Anti-Traitor Special Task Force?" "No." "Do you know that the China Youth Anti-Traitor Special Task Force is an assassination group?" "I don't know." "Do you know Yang Erqian, Fan Qishu, and Xiao Zhun?" "I only know Yang Erqian." "When did you meet Yang Erqian?" "I met him in mid-August last year during the Mid-Autumn Festival." "Is Yang Erqian also known as Yang Xiaoming?" Answer... "Do you know what position Yang Erqian held in the special task force?" "I don't know." "After you met Yang Erqian in August last year, how many times did you meet before October 25th?" "We met once at the fellow-provincials association." "Then, isn't Fan Qishu also your fellow-provincial?" "I don't know him." "Do you know what Xiao Zhun did in the special task force?" "I don't know." "When did you join the special task force, and who introduced you?" "I didn't join." "Do you know the organization of the special task force?" "I'm not clear." "Do you know Cheng Xiechao and Gong Bozhou?" "I met them when they came to my house to discuss business." "Do you know Yang Qixin, Li Qunjian, and Liang Jiubao?" "I don't know them." "Are Cheng Xiechao and Gong Bozhou members of the special task force?" "I'm not sure." "Do you know about the Revolutionary Army Corps of the Chinese Nationalist Party? Have you ever joined it?" "I don't know." "How many groups are there under the special task force?" "I don't know." "Is the special task force divided into a transportation group and an action group?" "I don't know, and I haven't heard of it." "Do you know when Yang Yongtai, the former chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, was assassinated?" "The newspapers reported it was on October 25th last year." "Where was it?" "The newspapers said it was at the first pier in front of the Jianghan Customs." "Do you know who assassinated Chairman Yang?" "I don't know." "Do you know the reason for the assassination of Chairman Yang?" "I don't know." "Were you at the scene when Chairman Yang was assassinated on October 25th last year?" "I was not." "Then, where were you?" "That day, I was at Dongchangkou in Wuchang, seeing a friend off back to Gedian." "Have you ever known Chairman Yang?" "I am a businessman; I have never known Chairman Yang." "Have you seen a photo of Chairman Yang?" "I haven't seen it." "When did you come to Hankou?" "I came to Hankou in the second half of 1930." "In the second half of 1930, where did you live in Hankou?" "I lived in Qiankang Soil Depot in Qianhualou. The shareholders of Qiankang Company are my relatives." "From 1930 until October 25th last year, did you always live in Qiankang Company?" "In 1934, Qiankang Company closed down, so I lived at No. 9 Baohua Lane in Caijia Lane, and finally moved to Xizi Street." "Do Yang Erqian and Xiao Zhun often come to visit you?" "I only know Yang Erqian. Xiao Zhun and Fan Qishu are fellow-provincials with Yang Erqian." "Do you know where Yang Erqian lives?" "I don't know." "After August last year, did Gong Bozhou come to your residence?" "I only met him when he came to discuss business." "You just said you didn't know Gong Bozhou, how do you know him now?" Answer... "Did you meet Yang Erqian on October 25th last year?" "No." "Didn't you and Yang Erqian cross the river to Wuchang on October 25th last year to investigate Chairman Yang's whereabouts?" "No." "Then, you met Cheng Xiechao and Gong Bozhou on October 15th last year?" "No." "On October 25th last year, did Yang Erqian ever tell you to cross the river to investigate Chairman Yang's whereabouts and help him?" "No." "You previously confessed elsewhere that you and Yang Erqian (i.e., Yang Xiaoming) crossed the river to investigate Chairman Yang's whereabouts, and later you reported to Gong Bozhou and Cheng Xiechao. Why are you changing your statement now?" Answer... "Hey, were you at the scene when Chairman Yang was assassinated?" "No." "Weren't you standing in front of the People's Information Office near Jianghan Customs?" "No." "Ultimately, on October 25th last year, did you know about Chairman Yang's news of crossing the river from Wuchang to Hankou? Did you tell Cheng Xiechao and Gong Bozhou, or did Yang Erqian notify them?" "I don't know." "Then, what was your role in standing at the People's Information Office?" "I don't know. Even if I was really standing there, who can prove it?" "What is the significance of you standing at the People's Information Office as a marker?" "I don't know." "What were Cheng Xiechao and Gong Bozhou holding in their hands at that time?" "I don't know." "You previously confessed that you saw Gong Bozhou and Tan Rongxuan (i.e., Cheng Xiechao) take out guns while you were standing at the People's Information Office. You also said that Gong Bozhou ran towards Zheng Street first, and Tan Rongxuan ran towards Hualou Street later. Why are you changing your statement now?" Answer... "I don't know how to read. I don't understand the words 'marker'." "You also confessed that Tan Rongxuan and Gong Bozhou both carried guns?" "I don't know." "On November 3rd last year, your confession in the Capital Police Department and later in the Xingying were completely the same. You confessed that there were a total of four people who assassinated Chairman Yang, including you?" Answer... "And you said that it was very windy that day, so you went to the Xintai'an Inn to feed yourself. Where is the Xintai'an Inn?" Answer: "It's a warehouse." You said that you reported to Gong Bozhou, Cheng Xiechao, and the other three, waiting for Chairman Yang to return to the riverside, how did you arrange the ambush on both sides?" Answer: "If I was at the People's Information Office that day, who can prove it?" "Didn't you say that Cheng Xiechao and Gong Bozhou both fired guns? If you weren't there, how did you know they fired guns?" Answer... "And according to Cheng Xiechao, you were present during the planning, preparation, and implementation of the assassination of Chairman Yang. Cheng Xiechao also said that your actions were strictly confidential and intimate like husband and wife, and you couldn't even talk about it?" "It's a false accusation." "Then, Gong Bozhou ran to your house to sleep after the assassination. You knew about it?" "I just said that I crossed the river to Wuchang on October 25th last year, I wasn't at home, how would I know?" At this point in the questioning, because Cao Bingrong was illiterate, the clerk read the testimony over to correct it, and the bailiff signed the name on his behalf. Cao Bingrong drew an "X" mark, and the bailiff escorted him back to the detention center. Then, Yang Qixin was questioned. Yang wore a yellow cotton Zhongshan suit, yellow leather shoes, and had a shaved head. He was short in stature and had a loud voice. According to his testimony, he was 19 years old, from Xingren, Guizhou, and studying at Zhongying Middle School in Nanjing. The Presiding Judge asked, "Yang Erqian, also known as Xiaoming, Xu Qunli, Chao, also known as Yang Wensheng, Yang Qixin?" "Yes." "Do you know that the China Youth Special Task Force for Eliminating Traitors is an assassination group?" "I didn't know before." "In May last year, Xiao Zhun sent you a letter asking you and Gong Bozhou to go to Lushan to investigate the whereabouts of Chairman Chiang. Is that correct?" "Yes." "Did Gong Bozhou go with you?" "We went together, but he went to Xingzi County." "Did you and Gong Bozhou write a letter reporting that the scenery of Guanyin Bridge was beautiful?" "When I arrived at Lushan, I did write a letter saying that the scenery of Guanyin Bridge was beautiful." "In August last year, did Yang Xiaoming ask you and Gong Bozhou to go to Shanghai once?" "Yes." "When you and Gong Bozhou arrived in Shanghai, did Yang Xiaoming ask you and Gong Bozhou to investigate the whereabouts of former Foreign Minister Zhang Qun?" "Yang Xiaoming told me, but I don't know if he said the same to Gong Bozhou or if he said it separately." "Did you and Gong Bozhou investigate?" "We went to the Wutai San Village Park in Nanjing once, but I don't remember the time clearly." "Did you investigate alone?" "I went." "Did you report that the scenery of the Overseas Chinese Reception Center was beautiful as a result of your investigation?" "I wrote it." At this point, the Presiding Judge ordered him to review his testimony and then withdrew. Then, Li Qunjian was questioned. Because he was a juvenile offender of sixteen years old, according to the Ministry of Justice's order, the Presiding Judge, Associate Judges, Prosecutor, and Clerk all removed their legal robes and changed to a conversational style. Li was dressed in a Boy Scout uniform, like a junior high school student. After arriving in court, he raised his hand to salute and then testified that he was sixteen years old, from Nantong, Jiangsu, residing at No. 2 Koukou New Village in Shanghai. The Presiding Judge asked, "Are you Yang Xiaoming's adopted son?" Li answered, "Yes." "Is Yang Xiaoming also known as Xu Qunli, Chao, Yang Erqian, also known as Yang Wensheng, Yang Bokun, Yang Qizhen?" "I only know that Yang Xiaoming is also known as Xu Qun and Yang Qizhen. I don't know the other aliases." "Is Yang Xiaoming the leader of the China Youth Special Task Force for Eliminating Traitors?" "I don't know." "Does the special task force have a transportation group and an action group?" "I don't know." "Did you work in the transportation group?" "No." "Did you come to Hankou in October last year?" "Yes." "Did you come from Shanghai?" "Yes." "What date?" "On October 17th last year, I came to Hankou from Shanghai on the Qingpu Steamer of the Sanbei Company, and arrived in Hankou on the morning of the 22nd." "What was the purpose of your trip to Hankou?" "Because Yang Xiaoming's wife in Shanghai had no money to use, she owed two months' rent, and she couldn't afford food. Mrs. Yang originally wanted to come herself, but her mother said that it was inconvenient for women to go out, so she asked me to come to Hankou alone to ask Yang Xiaoming for money on her behalf." "Did you find Yang Xiaoming when you arrived in Hankou?" "I found him." "Did you get the money?" "No, because Yang Xiaoming was also having difficulties. So, after staying in Hankou for one night, I took Yang's letter on the night of the 23rd and took the Yuehan Railway train to Guangdong to borrow money from his friend." "Where did you meet Yang Xiaoming in Hankou?" "At No. 39 Sanjiao Street in Hankou." "When did you arrive in Guangzhou?" "I arrived in Guangzhou on the 25th and went to find Yang Xiaoming's friend, Zhang Xilin (phonetic). Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhang was not at home. His father said that I should go to No. 77 Bonham Road in Hong Kong to find her husband." "What happened later?" "Later, I arrived in Hong Kong and went to visit Zhang at No. 77 Bonham Road. Zhang was not there, so I left a note explaining my purpose. I was staying at the Taian Inn in Hong Kong. He called me that night and asked me to meet him. I gave him Yang Xiaoming's letter. He said that the money could be remitted soon, because he had to find a way, and told me to return to Shanghai first. So, I took a ship back to Shanghai on the 28th. I don't know anything else." Finally, the Presiding Judge asked him when he became Yang Xiaoming's adopted son. He replied that it was when he was fourteen years old. At this point in the questioning, this juvenile offender was escorted out of court. The following is the interrogation about Wen Maoguan and Nie Jingquan buying guns. The Presiding Judge first brought up Wen Maoguan. Wen Maoguan was from Hanyang, 28 years old, and lived at No. 42 Yangtaizi in Hankou. He was arrested on November 22nd last year. At that time, he was still a member of the Investigation Section of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, so his identity is still under investigation. If he belongs to the military, he will be tried by a military organ in the future. The Presiding Judge and the Associate Judge discussed for a while, and also explained this in court. Wen Maoguan wore a yellow serge Zhongshan suit and had a robust body. According to his testimony, "I know Nie Jingquan, but I don't know Fan Qishu. The gun belonged to Song Yiheng, the company commander of the 26th Division, because Nie Jingquan said that the 102nd Division wanted guns for self-defense and had military passports, and asked me to mediate a price. The gun was sold at my home. Song Yiheng and Nie Jingquan were present, and no one else. The gun was a pistol, with some bullets, I didn't pay attention. The price of the gun was 45 yuan." Next, Nie Jingquan, 50 years old, from Jiangxi, residing at No. 11 Bayuanli in Hankou, a doctor wearing a silk shirt and a beard, was questioned. According to his testimony, "I know Fan Qishu, but I am not very clear about what Fan Qishu does, because someone asked him to be a matchmaker. I was introduced to Fan Qishu at the table. Later, Fan Qishu asked him to see a doctor often. According to Fan, he wanted to return to his hometown of Guizhou for a while, and wanted to buy guns for self-defense. That was around July 20th last year. Transportation in Guizhou was inconvenient, and he said that he had a passport from the 103rd Division. Later, I heard that Song Yiheng had guns to sell, so the transaction was made at Wen Maoguan's house. I handed the gun to Fan Qishu at the Nanjing Hotel, and the money was given to Song Yiheng at Wen Maoguan's house. The gun was a pistol with twenty bullets." At this point in the questioning, the court was adjourned. (Central News Agency)

Preparing to Install Silkworm Drying Machines in Various Locations

The Wu County Sericulture Improvement Zone, in view of the rapid increase in local silkworm breeding and the fact that silkworm drying procedures are still using old methods, which need improvement, plans to install twenty silkworm drying machines in various silkworm breeding locations. Yesterday, it was learned that this plan, based on the county's highest annual cocoon production of 20,000 dan of dried cocoons, with each silkworm drying machine capable of drying 1,000 dan, is an appropriate application. Each machine costs 10,000 yuan, and the total cost, including the base, is 200,000 yuan. Negotiations are currently underway with various cocoon firms. At the same time, the Provincial Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Plant outside Xumen is also planning to manufacture this type of machine and sell it at the lowest price.

### Zhenjiang

Organizing a Fruit Cooperative

The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, in view of the fact that Xiaoxian grapes and Dangshan pears in Jiangbei are famous products of this province, with large annual production and sales, but are affected by the invasion of foreign goods and the farmers in each county adhering to old methods without making improvements, and the losses due to packaging and transportation are difficult to calculate, has recently organized the Jiangbei Fruit Production and Marketing Cooperative to facilitate transportation and sales. In addition to improving packaging, a cold storage warehouse will be built to facilitate storage.

Supervising the Sale of Dried Cocoons

The Construction Department believes that the sericulture cooperatives in various counties, when drying and transporting cocoons for sale, occasionally have a few directors and supervisors who do not understand the righteousness, seek private gain, disregard public welfare, and do not hesitate to violate laws and disciplines, monopolize and manipulate, which not only affects the future of sericulture, but also damages the social economy. Yesterday, it ordered the directors of each sericulture area to closely supervise the sale when the various cooperatives transport dried cocoons for sale, together with the model area or improvement area and cooperative instructors, to prevent abuses.

### Yangzhou

Suspension of Deed Tax Collection Pending Transfer

The Jiangdu County Government, as the Deed Tax Collection Office was approved by the Finance Department to be collected by the Jiangsu Bank sending personnel to establish an office in the county from July 1st, did not wait until July and complied with the order to rush to complete the closing. In addition to notifying the Jiangsu Bank to send personnel to the county as soon as possible to take over, it also ordered the office to suspend collection on the 19th, and to investigate and create a clear list of various deed papers and promotional official seal receipts for handover.

Poor Silkworm Season in the Four Rural Districts

The silkworm season in the four rural districts of this county, the native species has reached the stage of mounting the cocooning frames, and the improved large batch of silkworms in their third sleep will also need to make cocoons in an instant. However, due to the sudden cold and heat, the silkworms were affected, and the continuous cloudy and rainy days caused the silkworms to eat wet leaves, and most of them developed stiff disease. The county government, in order to prevent stiff disease, specially distributed white stiff silkworm powder, which is suitable for improved species, so stiff disease is very rare in improved species. The price of green leaves has started to rise to three yuan, but now that the silkworm season is poor, it has plummeted to one yuan and five jiao per dan, and no one wants to buy it. All the cocoon factories in the county, including Tongchangshun, etc., in the urban area, seven in total, Yang Factory, Wuhua, etc., four in total, and Zhanghui, Ganlou, one each, have been fully leased, and will be fully weighed around the 24th.

Levying Grain Accumulation from Landlords

The Yin County Government, because the small county's allotment for continued grain accumulation has been approved and collected from this year's January, regarding the landlord's grain accumulation, the old urban area will be collected directly by the county, and the rural areas will be collected by the public security bureaus. For houses with leasing relationships, 3% of the rent will be collected. Houses pawned and occupied by the pawnee without other leasing relationships will be exempt from this grain accumulation. The county-stamped receipt will be collected quarterly. The grain accumulation for merchants will be collected by the 5th District Business Tax Bureau, and the grain accumulation for wealthy households will be compiled separately. The announcement was made to the public on the 18th.

Recently, it was heard that Yongyao Electric Light Company intends to invest in purchasing the plant, and Dunfeng is also willing to merge. It has opened a single contact once, and the conditions are still under negotiation.

### The Chamber of Commerce and Other Four Public Organizations, Along with Mayor Yu, Gave a Banquet for the Chilean Delegation Yesterday

Visited factories yesterday, free sightseeing today, and will take a train to Beijing tonight

Since its arrival in Shanghai, the Chilean Commercial Delegation has been warmly received by various parties in our country. They have been busy with banquets and social activities for days. The resolution to promote trade relations between the two governments, which was agreed upon at a symposium held the day before yesterday between the delegation, the International Trade Association, and business circles, was reportedly signed yesterday by Mr. Irasuli, the head of the delegation, and Mr. Xu Xinliu, the director of the International Trade Association. Yesterday, the delegation visited places such as the Wing On Textile Factory. Yesterday afternoon, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other public organizations hosted a tea party for the Chilean Chargé d'Affaires, and Mayor Yu hosted a banquet in the evening. Today, they will go sightseeing and are scheduled to take a train to Beijing tonight. The details are recorded below:

Yesterday's Visit

Led by the head of the delegation, Mr. Irasuli, all members of the delegation, accompanied by Mr. Li Chongpu, a factory inspector dispatched by the Municipal Social Bureau, and Mr. Fei Changhua, a translator, drove to the No. 2 Factory of the Wing On Textile Company in Wusong at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Then, they went to the Mayer Silk Factory in Dapuqiao. At 3:00 p.m., they continued to visit the Commodity Inspection Bureau on North Suzhou Road and the Tianli Liquefied Gas Products Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai.

Public Banquets by Organizations

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and the Money Dealers' Association jointly hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road at 1:00 p.m. yesterday to welcome the delegation. More than 60 people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Jin Runxiang, He Dekui, Cai Wuji, Hu Xiyuan, Tang Shixuan, Zhao Tiezhang, Ji Zejin, Wang Zhisheng, Dai Baoliu, Feng Xunchen, Gu Huaibing, Yan Esheng, Sheng Guren, Zhang Nanyin, and all members of the delegation led by Mr. Irasuli.

Mr. Wang's Speech

Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, presided over the banquet. During the banquet, Mr. Wang delivered a welcome speech, with Sheng Guren acting as the translator. The speech said: "Mr. Irasuli, the head of the Chilean Far East Commercial Delegation, and all members of the delegation, I am very pleased today to represent the entire business community of Shanghai and meet with you all. On the first day of his arrival in Shanghai, Mr. Irasuli first made a statement, 'Our two countries do not have any other issues to discuss. Only a few details regarding the trade relationship between the two countries need to be discussed with the Chinese government and economic circles. We should discuss this issue in a friendly and frank spirit.' This statement made the Shanghai business community feel infinitely interested. In recent times, all international issues, in essence, can be said to be economic issues. However, if we cannot have a friendly and frank discussion from the perspective of the economic community, we will inevitably fall into a stalemate. If we can, as Mr. Irasuli said, proceed in a friendly and frank spirit, we can not only maintain the peace in the Americas but also expand it into a world peace. You, the members of the delegation, have traveled a long way and first went to Japan, which has already laid a good foundation for the commercial relationship between the two countries and completed its valuable mission. Although China's industry is inferior to Japan, its products are richer than Japan, and its population is also larger than Japan. In proportion to the population's consumption, its market is definitely not narrower than Japan's. Therefore, in terms of the need for mutual exchange of goods between our two countries, the future prospects are truly limitless. In the past, our two countries were relatively far apart, and we did not pay much attention to the plans for developing commerce. In 1926, our association intended to hold a Chinese product exhibition in your country as a shortcut to developing commerce between the two countries. However, due to insufficient attention, it did not materialize, resulting in little progress over the past decade. Your delegation's visit to our country is surely to awaken mutual attention between the business communities of our two countries and create close economic ties. Our association sincerely hopes that all members of the delegation will stay in Shanghai for a longer period of time, raise relevant issues, have frank discussions, and make concrete decisions so that our association's aspiration in 1926 to develop commerce between our two countries can be fulfilled with the support of your delegation. I would be very grateful. I have briefly expressed my sincere wishes and hope to receive your advice and propose a toast to the health of all of you during your journey."

Head of the Delegation's Reply

After Mr. Wang's speech, Mr. Irasuli, the head of the delegation, replied and expressed his gratitude, saying in essence: "I am very grateful for the grand banquet hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Bankers' Association, and the Money Dealers' Association. All of you present are leaders in various sectors of your country. I believe that the financial community and the business community are most closely related and must achieve cooperation. Because if the business community does not have the assistance of the financial community, various difficulties will inevitably arise. Although I am not clear about the situation in your country, judging from the world situation, in the past six or seven years, all countries have been in a state of depression. The government cannot fully support finance and commerce. About eight years ago, the United States promulgated a bill implementing a national tax barrier policy, increasing import tax rates to restrict the import of foreign goods, resulting in the decline of international trade and a great blow to industry and commerce. Now, if we want to restore past prosperity, we must awaken the attention of governments of all countries and abolish the tariff barrier system. China is not yet an industrial country, but still values agriculture. The nitrate produced in Chile is the best fertilizer and is very suitable for China's agricultural needs. Therefore, I hope to be able to sell it to your country and hope that your government can grant it free trade. Although this will inevitably result in a loss in your country's tariff revenue, it will be of great benefit to the prosperity of world commerce, especially to the promotion of your country's goods to Chile. In his speech, Chairman Wang mentioned that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce had a suggestion in 1926, advocating holding a Chinese goods expo in Chile, which is of great significance. However, if your government cannot give preferential treatment to Chilean goods exported to China, I am afraid that even if China has this expo in Chile, it will be very difficult for Chinese goods to be sold in Chile. Chile can not only supply your country with fertilizers, but also supply barley and fruits in the near future. Some say that China also produces a lot of fruits, so there seems to be no need. However, the climate in Chile is different from that in your country. Sometimes, what Chile produces, China does not produce, and what China produces, Chile does not produce, which can be mutually adjusted. I would like to return the toast of the host and wish you all good health."

Chargé d'Affaires' Tea Party

Mr. Hua Jia, the Chilean Chargé d'Affaires to China and Consul General in Shanghai, held a grand tea party at the French Club on Mayer Road from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. yesterday to entertain the delegation. He also invited Mr. Yu Hongjun, the acting mayor of the city, Mr. Tang Shixuan, the secretary, Mr. Zhou Jue, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Zhao Tiezhang, the deputy director, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Xu Xinliu of the International Trade Association, and other leaders from all walks of life to participate.

Mayor's Banquet

Mr. Yu Hongjun, the acting mayor of the city, hosted a banquet at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road at 8:00 p.m. last night to entertain the delegation. In addition to the honored guests, Mr. Irasuli, the head of the delegation, and all members of the delegation, the accompanying guests included Mr. Hua Jia, the Chilean Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Zheng Lai, the director of the Customs Administration, Mr. Zhao Tiezhang, the deputy director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Xu Jianping, the director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, Mr. and Mrs. Bei Songshen, the manager of the Bank of China, Mr. and Mrs. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Mr. Ji Zejin, the secretary of the International Trade Bureau, Mr. Miao Zhongxiu, the executive of the International Trade Association, and Mr. Geng Jiaji and Mr. Tang Shixuan, the secretaries of the Municipal Government. Mayor Yu delivered a welcome speech, and Mr. Irasuli, the head of the delegation, replied with thanks and engaged in a very pleasant conversation. They did not disperse until about 10:00 p.m.

Going to Beijing Tonight

The delegation will have free sightseeing today and is scheduled to take a train to Beijing at 11:00 p.m. tonight. They are scheduled to arrive in Beijing tomorrow morning and pay a visit to Mr. Ma Chaojun, the mayor of Nanjing, at 9:00 a.m. At 9:30 a.m., they will pay a visit to Mr. Fu Bingchang, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, and Mr. Ma Yinchu, the chairman of the Economic Committee. At 10:00 a.m., they will pay a visit to Mr. Wang Chonghui, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. At 11:00 a.m., they will pay a visit to Mr. Wu Dingchang, the Minister of Industry. At 12:00 p.m., they will pay a visit to Mr. Shao Lizi, the Minister of Propaganda. Mr. Wang, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, will host a banquet at 1:00 p.m. In the afternoon, at 4:00 p.m., they will be received by Chairman Lin to present their credentials. At 4:20 p.m., Chairman Lin will host a tea party. Mr. Wu, the Minister of Industry, will host a banquet at 8:00 p.m. They will stay in Beijing for three days and leave Beijing for Pingjin on the 25th. On the 31st, they will go to Tianjin. Then, one part will go to Japan again, and the other part will go to Europe via Northeast China, and return to their country by different routes.

### British Commander-in-Chief Visited Commander Yang Yesterday

General Bartholomew, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, transferred from Shanghai to major inland areas to inspect the British troops stationed there. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30, accompanied by General Smalleyt, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Shanghai, and aides-de-camp, he made a special trip to the Longhua Garrison to visit Commander Yang, expressing his admiration. Commander Yang and Secretary Sun Luping received them, and a military band and honor guard were dispatched with great courtesy. They had a very pleasant conversation for half an hour and took a group photo as a memento. It is reported that Mr. Bartholomew will go to the Pingjin area on Saturday to carry out his mission. Commander Yang also plans to send a telegram to Chairman Song of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee to make proper arrangements for the reception in order to promote friendship.

### Acting Mayor Yu Repeatedly Invited the Concession Authorities to Discuss Anti-Smoking Measures

Agreed to Three Principles and Further Discussed Detailed Measures

Since the implementation of the central government's anti-smoking regulations in this city, the registration and reporting of smokers have been gradually completed. However, due to the fact that the concessions have not taken unified steps, most smokers have evaded, and the handling has been hindered. It is particularly difficult in terms of smuggling. Acting Mayor Yu, seeing this, has been earnestly consulting with the concession authorities in recent days to implement the central government's laws and regulations. He has successively invited Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, Mr. Bodard, the French Consul-General, and Mr. Fabre, the Chief of the French Concession Police, to hold multiple meetings.

It is reported that the concession authorities are quite agreeable in principle, and detailed measures are yet to be discussed. It is also reported that Acting Mayor Yu will formally write to the two concession authorities based on the results of the talks.

This association coordinates disaster relief and does not distinguish between provinces. Now, there are very few donations, and letters and telegrams requesting disaster relief from various provinces are still pouring in. How should this be handled? ㊁ Chairman Kong sent a telegram to negotiate with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the National Industrial Bank to borrow 300,000 yuan to handle urgent disaster relief in Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Gansu provinces. Now, Sichuan and Guizhou provinces have already formed their own disaster relief associations. How should this loan be handled? The above two cases were discussed together. It was decided that: (A) Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Qu Wenliu, two executive directors, will handle the loan procedures with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the National Industrial Bank. (B) The distribution of disaster relief funds will be: 140,000 yuan for Sichuan Province, 100,000 yuan for Guizhou Province, 20,000 yuan for Henan Province, 20,000 yuan for Gansu Province, and 10,000 yuan for Shaanxi Province. ㊂ It was decided to add Mr. Xu Keting and Mr. Kong Lingkan as executive directors.

### The Disaster Area Appeal Group in Gansu Province Petitioned the Disaster Relief Association

Listing the Tragic Situation of Natural and Man-Made Disasters

Mr. Gui Jianxing and Mr. Zhang Chunyuan and ten other members of the disaster area appeal group in Gansu Province went to the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association yesterday morning with a letter to petition for relief. The original letter said, "Respectfully, Hexi, Gansu, is located in the remote border area, with barren land and poor people. Since the earthquake disaster in the 16th year of the Republic of China, followed by a major flood, the 17th and 18th years were continuously plagued by military disasters. Cities were attacked and captured, burned, killed, looted, and the places passed through were written as ruins. Since then, hail disasters, frost disasters, insect disasters, rat disasters, sandstorm disasters, and heavy rain disasters have come one after another, too numerous to mention. The drought disaster is the most widespread and has lasted for a very long time. For this reason, the local vitality has been greatly damaged, the people's wounds have not yet healed, and the wailing sounds are all over the fields and have long been waiting for food. Unfortunately, on October 25th last winter, 40,000 to 50,000 bandits crossed the river and went west, disturbing the counties. The cities that were attacked and captured, such as Gulang, Yongchang, Shandan, Linze, and Gaotai, occupied them for several months or dozens of days. All the goods and savings in the shops, the grain, livestock, clothes, and belongings in the villages were looted. Needless to say, the counties such as Jingtai, Yongdeng, Wuwei, Minle, Minqin, and Zhangye, although they did not capture the county seat, the bandits spread out in all directions and went everywhere. All the people's grain and clothing were used as food and clothing for the bandits. The people's houses and firewood were mostly used as fuel for the bandits. The people's cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens were mostly used as rewards for the bandits. They also robbed mules, donkeys, camels, and horses for transportation and looting. They occupied villages and fortresses, randomly tore down doors and households, and dug tunnels everywhere, as places to resist the government troops. When they encountered government troops fighting, they blew them up and turned them into scorched earth, otherwise, they set them on fire before leaving. Because of this, families that were well-off were immediately bankrupt, and poor families immediately ran out of food. Especially those who were in charge of official business or who were slightly wealthy were often forced to vote and tortured in every way. If there was a slight mistake, they were immediately killed. Those who saw it could not help but feel cold, and those who heard it could not help but feel sad. According to statistics, the people's losses were no less than 30 million yuan, and more than 370,000 people were affected by the disaster. The severity of the disaster was no less than that of Sichuan, Guizhou, Henan, and other provinces. The material resources were difficult, the transportation was inconvenient, and the disaster relief was more difficult than in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Henan provinces. Now that the spring plowing has passed, there is a lack of seeds, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. If relief is not widely provided, the old and weak will fill the gullies, and the young and strong will be displaced in all directions, which is unavoidable. Recently, although the central government has allocated funds for relief, due to the wide disaster area and the large number of people, the distribution of relief funds is a drop in the bucket and it is difficult to provide universal relief. Local people, in order to seek fundamental relief, publicly elected representatives to run around and appeal. They borrowed from Jiang Bo, who was known at home and abroad for his concern for hunger and drowning, and provided relief to all disaster areas. They sincerely requested your association to cherish the remnants of the border and advocate fundraising to provide large-scale relief, so that the people of Gansu who were affected by the disaster could stretch their necks and wait for relief. There is no limit to the anticipation and blessing."

Central News Agency: Since the 16th year of the Republic of China, various disasters have occurred frequently in the counties of Hexi, Gansu. The most tragic was the disturbance of the bandits last winter. Counties such as Gulang, Shandan, Yongchang, Linze, and Gaotai were all captured by the bandits. Even Jingtai, Yongdeng, Wuwei, Minqin, Minle, Zhangye, and other counties that were not captured were also ravaged by them. Although they have now been suppressed by Mr. Ma Buqing, the commander of the 5th Cavalry Division of the Central Army, and Mr. Ma Bufang, the commander of the 100th Division, the people in the disaster-stricken areas of each county are dying every day due to the lack of livelihood, and the situation is serious and in urgent need of relief. According to the disaster survey form submitted to all parties by the Gansu Hexi Disaster Area Appeal Group: (1) The amount of property loss: Zhangye is 7,465,529 yuan, Linze is 6,547,940 yuan, Shandan is 5,919,236 yuan, Yongchang is 5,670,877 yuan, Jingtai is 2,879,240 yuan, Wuwei is 2,000,297 yuan, Minle is 1,629,684 yuan, Gulang is 746,590 yuan, Minqin is 323,220 yuan, and Yongdeng is 223,100 yuan. (2) The number of disaster-stricken people: Wuwei is 69,747, Zhangye is 68,512, Linze is 46,461, Yongchang is 43,010, Shandan is 42,569, Minle is 40,188, Jingtai is 19,562, Gulang is 17,491, Yongdeng is 14,848, and Minqin is 12,355. After arriving in Shanghai, the group is appealing for relief from all parties.

### Mr. Baker's Opinions on Relieving the Guizhou Disaster

Mr. Baker, the Chief Executive of the China International Famine Relief Commission, has published an article discussing the relief of the Guizhou disaster, which is recorded as follows: Since last autumn, drought demons have raged, and Sichuan, Henan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and other provinces have reported disasters one after another. Guizhou is one of the provinces with the most serious disaster situation. According to reports from the Guizhou Provincial Government and the Guizhou branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission, the drought has affected more than 60 counties, accounting for almost two-thirds of the province's area. There are more than 3.7 million disaster victims in total. The land is cracked and the soil is split, the wells are dry and the rivers are empty. Agricultural products have withered and dried up, and drinking water is expected to be scarce. Spring plowing is hopeless, and autumn harvest is difficult to expect. The most severely affected counties include Zunyi, Tongzi, Renhuai, Chishui, Guiyang, Anshun, Xingyi, Xingren, Puan, Bijie, Weining, Zhenfeng, Kelong, Zhengan, Sinan, Yanhe, Guanling, Zhenning, Fenggang, Annan, Ceheng, and other twenty or more counties. The disaster victims are eating tree bark and grass roots, and some are digging white clay to fill their stomachs, resulting in abdominal distension and death. Robberies of grain are also happening endlessly. If relief is not provided quickly, bandits will be everywhere and the starving will be seen lying dead on the roads. The Ministry of Finance has allocated 330,000 yuan in public bonds and 300,000 yuan in cash to the province for emergency relief. The Shanghai Guizhou Disaster Relief Association and the Nanjing Guizhou Disaster Relief Support Association have also been established, and many public and private charitable organizations have also started fundraising for relief. Given the severe drought situation in Guizhou, it is imperative to raise funds for relief, which goes without saying. However, in terms of how to provide relief, a thorough review must be conducted beforehand to achieve practical results. In my opinion, it is better to provide food than to give money. Money cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold. It not only cannot help with disaster relief, but sometimes it is enough to create a disaster. Why? Because when there is a lot of money, the price of grain rises, and those who could barely support themselves will also have difficulty living and become disaster victims. Moreover, Guizhou has barren land and thin soil, and agricultural products are always in short supply. When there are natural disasters such as floods and droughts, grain is even more scarce. Therefore, the need for food to save the Guizhou disaster is even more urgent than in other provinces. I have heard that rice is being imported from other provinces, but only a few trucks are used for transportation. Each truck can carry up to two tons of rice, and even if they arrive once a day at the fastest speed, it is still less than ten tons. Let alone the 2.7 million disaster victims, even if only 100,000 people need relief to survive, they would still need 60 tons of rice per day per person. This small amount is like a drop in the bucket, what is the use in an emergency? It is imperative to import a large amount of relief rice in order to save the dying victims. This is obvious to anyone with intelligence. If only money is distributed without providing food, I am afraid that the lives of the disaster victims will not be saved much. If we talk about importing relief rice, there must be a thorough plan to choose a fast and economical method to carry it out effectively in order to achieve the effect of disaster relief. The eastern part of Guizhou is mostly mountainous, with no waterways or railways for transportation. Only rugged roads can be used for transportation. If trucks are used to transport rice, each truck can carry one ton of rice and it takes more than a day to travel the 400 kilometers from the Guizhou border to Guiyang. To import 60 tons a day, 60 trucks are needed on both ends of the road and in the middle to keep going back and forth. If the price of each truck is 5,000 yuan, then these 180 trucks will cost 900,000 yuan. Adding the cost of purchasing rice and fuel, millions of yuan must be prepared in advance to get started. It is impossible to raise such a large amount of money at once. Therefore, it can be said with certainty that it is impossible to transport rice by truck. For the current plan, the only way is to specially make large rubber-wheeled carts and recruit disaster victims to transport rice. If we consider that there are 100,000 disaster victims waiting for relief, except for the disaster workers who transport rice, we can support 10,000 people (as will be explained later). We still need 50 tons of rice per day. Each large cart can carry one ton of rice, and it takes about ten days to travel from the Guizhou border to Guiyang. If we purchase rice from Hunan Province and use 50 large carts per day for transportation, then a total of 500 carts should be prepared to transport back and forth on the road, so that rice can be transported every day, and the disaster victims will not have to worry about starvation. Each rubber-wheeled cart costs about 100 yuan, and 500 carts cost a total of 50,000 yuan, which is sixteen or seventeen times less than the cost of trucks. If disaster victims are recruited to transport rice, each person is given five catties of rice per day to support a family of five. Each cart needs four people, giving a total of 20 catties of rice. Transporting rice once every ten days, one ton each time, gives a total of 200 catties of rice. At a price of one dime and one cent per catty, it costs 22 yuan to transport one ton of rice. Adding the depreciation of the cart, which is one yuan each time, the total cost is 23 yuan, which is only a quarter of the cost of using trucks, which is about 100 yuan per ton. This is in terms of saving costs. If we talk about the benefits to the disaster victims, this rice transportation project requires 2,000 people to transport 500 carts, and each person gets enough food for five people, which can support 10,000 people. Furthermore, in terms of fair pricing, since the transportation cost is low, the selling price can be low. As mentioned earlier, it costs 23 yuan to transport one ton of rice, which is about 1.4 cents per catty (each English ton is about 16 dan and 80 catties). Adding the rice price of one dime and one cent, the total cost is about one dime and three cents. Selling it for nine cents per catty in Guiyang and other counties will prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and raising prices, and the disaster victims will benefit greatly. The above is only a brief overview of the importance of food relief and the benefits of transporting grain by large carts. As for how to raise funds, how to distribute relief grain, how to purchase carts and rice, how to recruit disaster workers to transport rice, and other issues related to organization and management, all of them are important. Due to space limitations, I cannot discuss them one by one. I hope that those who are concerned about relief work will provide guidance.

### The Chamber of Commerce Offers Advice on Rewarding Income Tax Withholding

Deduct the full amount at the time of reporting. If there are any errors, let them make up for it.

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office yesterday regarding the 0.5% reward for withholding income tax, stating: "We are writing to inquire about Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, which states, 'Those who withhold income tax, if they can complete their withholding duties in accordance with legal procedures and deadlines, the local competent collection agency may give a reward of 0.5% of the total amount withheld.' According to the meaning of the words 'give a reward,' it should be issued by the competent collection agency after receiving the tax payment and verifying it. However, the amounts are small and scattered, and it takes extra steps to issue and collect receipts, which is unavoidable. This does not seem to be in line with the purpose of your office to strive for simplicity and convenience for businesses. The method of how to give the reward has not yet been determined. In our opinion, if the withholding agency deducts the full amount at the time of reporting, and if there are any errors, your office can verify them and ask them to make up for it, the procedures will be more convenient. We would like to ask you to consider this carefully and decide on its implementation. This is our sincere request."

### Seamen's Representatives Go to Beijing Again to Urge the Recovery of Pilotage Rights

If necessary, the National Seamen will Launch a Larger Petition. Public Organizations Respond with Telegrams to Maintain Sovereignty

The All-China Seamen's Union continues to strive for the recovery of pilotage rights and has sent representatives to Beijing again to urge the Executive Yuan to implement the measures passed by the Third Plenary Session. Public organizations across the country have also sent telegrams of support to maintain sovereignty. The details are as follows:

Sending Representatives to Beijing to Urge Implementation

Regarding the pilotage rights of China's coastal rivers, the Customs authorities have entrusted them to foreigners for decades. The power is in the hands of foreigners, and our government has no right to manage it. The All-China Seamen's Union believes that pilotage rights are of great importance to national defense and military affairs. If they are not recovered as soon as possible, it will have an impact on the survival of the entire nation and people if an incident occurs internationally. Therefore, the All-China Seamen's Union established the "Movement Committee for the All-China Seamen to Request the Government to Recover Pilotage Rights." Representatives were sent to Beijing to petition during the Third Plenary Session, and members of the Central Committee, such as Yang Hu, jointly proposed to recover pilotage rights and transfer the management of pilots to the Ministry of Transportation. The motion was passed by the plenary session and handed over to the Executive Yuan for handling. However, after several months, there are still no instructions on how to handle it. Therefore, in order to thoroughly strive for the recovery of pilotage rights, the All-China Seamen's Union has sent representatives to Beijing again to urge the Executive Yuan to immediately implement the motion passed by the Third Plenary Session in order to maintain sovereignty and consolidate defense.

Public Organizations Respond with Telegrams of Support

Since the Movement Committee for the All-China Seamen to Request the Government to Recover Pilotage Rights requested the central government to recover pilotage rights and issued a declaration, revealing the relationship between the recovery of pilotage rights and national defense to the public, public organizations from agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia across the country, as well as the Shanghai General Labor Union, the Postal Workers' Union, the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Workers' Unions directly under the Ministry of Railways, and the All-China Seamen's Union, have responded with telegrams of support, expressing their unanimous support. A reporter from Dagong Daily interviewed the person in charge of the Movement Committee yesterday. According to him, if the Executive Yuan does not implement the resolutions of the plenary session, they will gather seamen from all over the country and send representatives to launch a larger petition, and they will not stop until the goal is achieved.

Reasons for Recovering Pilotage Rights

The reasons for recovering pilotage rights and transferring management to the Ministry of Transportation are summarized as follows: (1) Recovering pilotage rights has no impact on diplomacy. China has not signed any treaties with other countries on the pilotage issue. The reason why it cannot be recovered now is that foreign customs officers are unwilling to work for China's national defense and national rights. If management is transferred to the Ministry of Transportation, foreign nationals will not be allowed to serve as pilot trainees in China, except for Articles 1 and 2 of the Provisional Pilotage Regulations. If a foreign pilot on active duty dies or leaves office, a national pilot trainee will be added to fill the vacancy. At the same time, the Ministry of Transportation will cultivate pilot talents. In this way, pilotage rights can naturally be recovered without any difficulty. (2) In 1931, the Legislative Yuan passed the Organic Law of the Ministry of Transportation and the Organic Law of Local Shipping Administration Bureaus, stipulating that pilots are under the supervision and management of the Ministry of Transportation and the Shipping Administration Bureau. This was promulgated by order of the National Government. However, in 1933, the Executive Yuan issued the Provisional Pilotage Regulations, which stipulate in Articles 1 and 2 that pilotage management committees should be established in various ports. Therefore, the Ministry of Transportation cannot exercise its functions. Except for Shanghai, the pilotage management committees in other ports have not been established. Even the pilotage management committee established in Shanghai is controlled by foreign officers. They turn a blind eye to the provisions of the Provisional Pilotage Regulations other than Articles 1 and 2, which stipulate measures to eliminate foreign pilots. Therefore, pilotage rights have not been recovered to this day. (3) The nine-yuan system was created by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The Organic Law of the Ministry of Transportation has been passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. Therefore, the Executive Yuan can only supervise the Ministry of Transportation to implement it earnestly and should not set up another pilotage management agency to violate the promulgated laws. (4) Article 1 of the Provisional Pilotage Regulations stipulates that pilotage management committees should be established in various ports. This point is detrimental to national rights. Although pilotage work in Tianjin, Xiamen, Shantou, Shanghai, and other places is entirely undertaken by foreigners, it is undertaken by Chinese in other ports. The management agencies are also presided over by Chinese. For example, Qingdao belongs to the municipal government, Guangzhou belongs to the provincial government, and Hanyi, Yiyi, and Chongqing belong to the Navy Department. If pilotage committees must be established in various ports, then the pilotage affairs in Qingdao, Guangzhou, Yiyi, and Hanyi must be transferred to the Customs foreign tax officer for management, which is undoubtedly detrimental to national rights. (5) There are only two or three pilots in Tianjin, Qingdao, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou. According to Article 2 of the Provisional Pilotage Regulations, the Ministry of Finance should send two representatives, and the Navy Staff, the Ministry of Transportation, and the local Chamber of Commerce should each send one representative to form a committee. Then there would be a total of seven people. Managing one time the number of people by two times the number of committee members, is this not more officials than soldiers, wasting public funds? It can be seen that it is not necessary in fact. (6) China has a long coastline and riverbank. Therefore, there are dozens of important ports along the river and sea. According to Article 2 of the Regulations, in addition to the representatives of the Ministry of Finance who belong to the Customs, other ministries must send a representative to each port. Then there would be dozens of representatives in total. How can each ministry have so many people with pilotage knowledge to send to various places? This is another proof that Articles 1 and 2 of the Regulations do not conform to the facts. (7) China's pilotage rights have been ruined by foreign Customs officers. Although they are Chinese employees, they have a special mission to supervise tariffs in China on behalf of their countries. Therefore, they do their best to seize all rights that are beneficial to their countries. For example, Customs officer Hart drafted the pilotage regulations, allowing foreigners to engage in pilotage business in China. Daishaoer, the patrol engineer of the Jianghai Customs, assigned the copper sand pilotage rights to foreigners. The past is a clear warning. How can we repeat the mistakes of the Qing Dynasty and hand it over to foreign customs officers for management? Isn't this a mistake again? (8) At the beginning of the establishment of the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee, Chinese people expressed their opposition. Later, because it advocated the recovery of copper sand pilotage rights and the elimination of foreign pilots, the opposition of the vacant officers was slightly eased. However, after the establishment of the committee, the power was actually controlled by foreign officers. They are hypocrites, deceiving our government, and bullying our people. They neither proceed to recover pilotage rights nor eliminate foreign pilots, but specialize in suppressing national pilots and manipulating the Yangtze River pilotage business. For example, they abolished the licenses of the Navy Department, rendering legal qualifications invalid, and restricted the number of Chinese pilots, causing national pilots to gradually disappear. There are now more than 100 unemployed national pilots. It should be quickly returned to the Ministry of Transportation for management to ensure their protection. (9) The Ministry of Finance is in charge of taxation. There is no doubt that the staff of this ministry have knowledge and experience in taxation. However, pilots are transportation technicians and have nothing to do with the Ministry of Finance. How can they be handed over to their management, which would damage the administrative system? (10) At present, the pilotage management in various ports in China is extremely inconsistent. In those controlled by Customs foreign officers, all the pilots in that port are foreigners. In those controlled by the Navy Department or local governments, although they are Chinese, they lack unified training and planning. Especially today, China's pilotage rights must be recovered, and the Chinese pilotage industry needs to be supported. There should be a unified management agency to coordinate and handle it. And this agency is none other than the Ministry of Transportation, because in fact, the Ministry of Transportation is the highest shipping administration agency. In law, pilots have long been stipulated by the Legislative Yuan to be managed by the Ministry of Transportation. (11) The pilotage management agency passed by the Legislative Yuan is the Ministry of Transportation, and the regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan are the pilotage management committee. Both are our internal affairs. Therefore, abolishing the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee and revising Articles 1 and 2 of the Provisional Pilotage Regulations, and changing them to be managed by the Ministry of Transportation, only requires an order from the Executive Yuan. Although foreign officers are not satisfied, they have no reason to object. Therefore, it has absolutely no impact on foreign countries. (12) Article 45 of the Provisional Pilotage Regulations stipulates that "If there are any improprieties, they can be amended at any time." Now that there is a conflict in law, it is detrimental to national rights, and the situation in various ports is not consistent. Therefore, according to the provisions of Article 45, Articles 1 and 2 of the Regulations should be amended to "Pilotage in various ports, except for military ports, shall be managed by the Ministry of Transportation."

### Suspicious Case of Meat Chunks Filling Wooden Boxes and Coal Baskets

Human Meat or Animal Meat? The Examination Could Not Determine

Yesterday morning at around 0:20, patrol officers from the Public Concession Cheng County Road police station were patrolling near the intersection of Racecourse Road East and Dragon Gate Road when they discovered a wooden box, a coal basket, and a hemp sack left unattended on the roadside. The Chinese constables were greatly surprised and waited nearby for the owner to claim them. However, after a long time with no activity, they became suspicious and immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched a vehicle to transport the wooden box and other items to the Chengdu Road police station. Upon opening and inspecting each item, they found the box, basket, and sack filled with countless meat chunks mixed with lime and dirt, with no traces of blood, and a foul odor that made people want to vomit. At that time, both Chinese and Western detectives were shocked and suspected a bizarre and tragic case. They surmised that the meat chunks might be dismembered body parts, but the hands, feet, and head were missing. At the same time, it was unknown who had placed the box and basket there. Therefore, they immediately sent the wooden box and basket to the examination department. After examination, no definitive conclusion could be reached, with the examiner only stating that it looked very much like human meat or perhaps the meat of some other animal. As a result, the police station is urgently conducting further investigations. In addition to ordering detectives to investigate the case, they are also investigating with various rickshaw companies to determine if any rickshaw pullers were hired to transport the wooden box to the aforementioned location. Anyone with information is urged to report to the nearest police station and will be handsomely rewarded. Furthermore, they are carefully examining the wooden box for any fingerprints that might provide clues. Therefore, the inside story should soon be revealed. However, the circumstances are bizarre and shocking.

### Russian Beggar Accumulates 2,000 Gold Coins, Narrowly Escapes Murder by Fellow Countryman

Saved by Police Just as Axe Was About to Fall

An elderly Russian man named Vallyunas (transliteration), 70 years old, residing on Fu Li Li Road in the French Concession, has been begging for a living due to his old age and unemployment. He has accumulated as much as 2,000 yuan through careful savings. Three months ago, the French police detained him for begging along the road, which obstructed traffic. At that time, a fellow countryman named Di Akefu (transliteration), 32 years old, who made a living sharpening knives and resided on Jin Shenfu Road, was also arrested by the police for not having a business license and was detained in the same cell as Vallyunas. When Vallyunas was taken into custody at the police station, 2,000 yuan in cash was found on his body. Di Akefu caught a glimpse of it, and the police, fearing that Vallyunas would be in danger with so much money, took the initiative to deposit the money in the postal savings department. When the police released Vallyunas, they returned the deposit certificate to him. After being released, Di Akefu approached Vallyunas and started associating with him, inviting him to drink every day and persuading him to withdraw the money and carry it with him, lest something happen to it in the post office. On the 17th of this month, Di Akefu learned that Vallyunas had withdrawn the money. On the evening of that day, at 10 p.m., he secretly carried a sharp axe and lured Vallyunas to the wasteland between Xiafei Road and Ladu Road, intending to rob and kill him. Just as Di was about to swing the axe and harm Vallyunas, Vallyunas shouted loudly for help. The police heard the call and rushed to the scene, arresting Di and seizing the weapon, a sharp axe. They were both taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second Court. Judge Sun Pengxian interrogated them, and Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer from the police department, explained the case, requesting a postponement of the investigation before requesting a trial.

Zhou Xiaoqing, a Cantonese, has been engaged in the stage business for a long time. After the Sanxing Stage on Niuzhuang Road closed, Zhou raised 50,000 yuan in the winter of the 24th year to take over the business and renamed it the Linji Gengxin Stage, with Zhou serving as the manager. Due to business losses, the stage was rented out to others for business last year. Recently, the partner of Linji Gengxin Stage, Weng Xieyao, discovered that Zhou and the accounting director Hu Jingan had committed a breach of trust together. He hired lawyer Xu Jashi to file a criminal lawsuit in the First Court against them for joint breach of trust, requesting that they be punished according to Article 142, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The main points of his indictment are as follows: When Zhou Xiaoqing took over the business, he borrowed 2,500 yuan from the plaintiff. Later, at Zhou's request, he raised another 500 yuan, totaling 3,000 yuan, as capital. The plaintiff had no choice but to agree. However, Zhou claimed that his capital was 25,000 yuan, but he did not pay a penny at the time. Only at the shareholders' meeting, he proposed that the costumes, scenery, and electrical materials of the Nanjing Heji Gengxin Stage, which he operated, be valued at 25,000 yuan to offset the capital. The shareholders generally agreed, as Zhou was the founder and general manager, and it was inconvenient to publicly oppose. At that time, the shareholder Yao Jingji (who invested 10,000 yuan) immediately declared his withdrawal from the shares. Zhou promised to comply, and the plaintiff also subsequently requested to withdraw from the shares, but was rejected by Zhou. However, Zhou should have been responsible for delivering the costumes, etc., which were used to offset the shares, to the stage. However, he later listed freight charges of up to 4,095 yuan and rented out the costumes of the former Sanxing Stage, which had been taken over, for only 100 yuan. Furthermore, in the 25th year, he listed entertainment expenses of more than 6,460 yuan, the use of which was not disclosed. In the same year, he listed staff salaries of 24,700 yuan, actor packages of 75,500 yuan, scene surfaces of more than 4,300 yuan, and repair costs of more than 1,100 yuan, all of which were excessive. Therefore, he requests that they be severely punished according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chuan Lin opened the Eighth Criminal Court for interrogation. Zhou Xiaoqing and Hu Jingan arrived with lawyer Xuan Zhendong. According to their defense, all expenses were listed in the accounts, and the costumes, etc., of the Heji Gengxin Stage were transferred to the Linji Gengxin Stage, not used to offset the shares. This matter was still passed by the shareholders' meeting. They then submitted the account books, etc., to the court. The court reviewed the statements and ordered a retrial at a later date.

### Yuyao Native Association Dispatches Personnel to Yao to Provide Disaster Relief

The Yuyao Native Association in Shanghai previously received a letter from the Lake Embankment Police Station of Yuyao County, stating that at 9 PM on the 10th of this month, a fire broke out at the home of farmer Yu Renmao in Xinshi Street, causing the fire to spread to eighteen neighboring households. At this time when crops are not yet ready for harvest, the affected farmers are truly pitiable. They previously came to the station seeking assistance, but the station's resources are limited and unable to provide relief. They earnestly hoped that the Association would generously provide assistance and solicit donations from Shanghai merchants and gentry to help the affected farmers receive some relief. After receiving the letter, the Association immediately requested assistance from the Chinese Relief Society. The Society agreed to donate 180 yuan in national currency, and the Association also raised some funds. They dispatched personnel to Yuyao yesterday with the funds to investigate and distribute aid.

### Transportation Bureau Approves Unloading of Whole Cars of Waste Flowers at North Shanghai Station

The North Shanghai Cargo Depot of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has generally not handled whole-carload shipments, whether originating or arriving. However, to meet previous needs, it was previously stipulated that whole cars of quicklime, firewood, fresh eggs, tin, charcoal, live ducks, whole cars of broad beans transported from the Shanghai-Hangzhou section, and fresh produce, etc., were specially allowed to be unloaded at that station. Now, upon receiving a letter from the Yongtailong Transportation Company of the Zhabei Port, requesting that whole cars of waste flowers transported to Shanghai also be unloaded at North Shanghai Station, it was deemed feasible and approved to be handled accordingly.

### Lawsuit Filed for Illegal Seizure of Property

Jia Shan, owner of Jiashan Ji Transportation Company, retained attorneys Shan Yanjun and Hu Yuanjun to file a lawsuit in the District Court against Zhu Zenggui of No. 8 Bujiatai, Southwest Yangjing Town, Pudong, for colluding to illegally seize farmland. The lawsuit stated that Zhu Zenggui became involved in a debt dispute with Chen Wangsheng on March 13 of this year regarding 1.2 mu of farmland in Plot 734, Er Tu Lai Zi Xu, Yangjing District. Instead of seizing the 1.25 mu of farmland belonging to Luo Pinshan in Plot 109, which should have been seized, they strangely seized the plaintiff's property. The lawsuit cited Zhuang Hongkui, the land guarantor, and Zhuang Jinlong and Zhuang Longgen, the sellers of the land, and debtor Chen Wangsheng as witnesses. After a hearing was held by the court, an investigation was conducted with the Land Bureau. The Bureau sent a document stating that the property rights belonged to Jia Shanshan. After another interrogation and debate in court yesterday, the court ordered the case to be submitted for a verdict.

### The Problem of Mezzanine Floors in the Public Concession

A Subcommittee is Formed to Study the Issue

The issue of more than 80,000 mezzanine floors built by Chinese taxpayers in the alleyways of the Public Concession has been raised. The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council, citing concerns about sanitation, ordered the Public Works Department to investigate. The matter was raised at the Board of Directors meeting on the 19th, and Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Mr. King (W. S. King), the British director and general manager of Jinlong Tea Company, were appointed to a subcommittee to study the issue. A reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency interviewed the two Chinese directors, Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, yesterday morning to inquire about their opinions. The details are recorded below:

More Than 80,000 Mezzanine Floors in the Entire District

There are more than 80,000 mezzanine floors in the entire Public Concession (according to a survey by the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council). Almost every alleyway has mezzanine floors. These mezzanine floors were built entirely by Chinese taxpayers, and are typically built above kitchens, stairwells, or rooftops.

Ordered to be Demolished Due to Sanitation Concerns

At a recent (the year before last) annual meeting of Western taxpayers in the Municipal Council, Western taxpayers raised concerns that these mezzanine floors were detrimental to sanitation and submitted a proposal to the meeting, instructing the Municipal Council to order their demolition. After receiving the proposal, the Council instructed the Public Works Department to investigate, believing that they did indeed pose a sanitation problem, and presented the issue at the Board of Directors meeting on the 19th.

Subcommittee Formed to Conduct Research

During the Board of Directors meeting on the 19th, the Chinese directors objected, so it was decided to form a subcommittee consisting of Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Mr. King to conduct a thorough study. It was reported that the Chinese directors stated that the residents of the mezzanine floors were as miserable as those living in shantytowns, and this was not the wish of Chinese taxpayers. Before the Municipal Council could come up with a good solution, it would be impossible to demolish them immediately. After a lengthy debate, the British, American, and Japanese directors appointed the two Chinese directors, Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, and Mr. King, who was familiar with the plight of the Chinese, to a subcommittee to study the issue.

Chinese Allowed to Build Houses Only Eight Feet High

It was reported that the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council had suggested a strange plan, stating that in the future, Chinese people building houses within the Public Concession should not be allowed to build higher than eight feet, for fear that they would build mezzanine floors above that height. The Chinese directors strongly objected, and the plan was abandoned.

Persuading Residents to Dismantle Mezzanine Floors

It was reported that the Board of Directors decided to implement the proposal of the Western taxpayers' annual meeting. Although the Chinese directors explained the situation several times, the principle was still confirmed. During the study period, residents would be persuaded to dismantle their mezzanine floors. According to the reporter's investigation and estimate, there are currently more than 80,000 mezzanine floors in the Concession, with a construction cost of approximately more than three million yuan. The seriousness of the problem is no less than that of the shantytowns, as nearly 80,000 people live in these mezzanine floors.

Jiang and Xi Say It Is an Economic Issue

According to Jiang Yiping, the issue is indeed very serious, and he and others feel a great responsibility in being tasked with studying it. However, this is an economic issue, not a legal issue. According to Xi Yushu, the issue is entirely an economic one. He hoped that the Municipal Council would first build good houses before moving the mezzanine floor residents. It is understood that Jiang and Xi are currently collecting materials and studying plans to ensure that the mezzanine floor residents are not inconvenienced by the demolition while still meeting the goal of not hindering sanitation.

### Labor Service Matters for County Civil Servants

The Shanghai County Party, government, army, and civil servants' spring labor service includes two items: sanitation inspection and warehouse road construction. The road construction plan, drafted by Construction Director Qi Kezhong, stipulates that the section from Shanghai-Min Road to Shiqiao to Beiqiao Street will be 394 meters long and 3 meters wide. The personnel participating in the service from various agencies are divided into six groups, with group leaders designated and the length of each work section specified. It was implemented yesterday and will last for three days, until the 22nd.

### Two Apprentices Stab Each Other Over Trivial Matters, Resulting in Abdominal Rupture and Intestinal Damage

Wu Ruiqing and Xu Qingtang Seriously Injured in Argument

At the Juxing Fruit Shop at No. 243 North Zhejiang Road, two apprentices, both from Changzhou, named Wu Ruiqing, 18 years old, and Xu Qingtang, 17 years old, were involved in a serious incident yesterday around 9:20 AM. Xu Qingtang was washing sugar cane at the entrance of the shop, while Wu Ruiqing was peeling sugar cane for customers at a stall near the doorway. The two were no more than a foot apart. Xu Qingtang, feeling that Wu's position was obstructing his washing work, asked him to move aside. When Wu refused, Xu used a sugar cane to lightly tap Wu's abdomen. Unexpectedly, Wu also grabbed a fruit knife and stabbed Xu in the abdomen. Due to excessive force, Xu's abdomen was ruptured, his intestines spilled out, and blood gushed out, causing him to collapse on the ground. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Wu attempted to escape, but was restrained by the shop staff, who called the police. He was taken into custody at the police station and will be sent to the court this morning for investigation. Xu Qingtang was taken to the hospital for treatment, but his injuries are severe and he is in critical condition.

### Previous Night's Thunderstorm in Shanghai Relieves Heat, but Yesterday Morning's Heat Dissipated Entirely

After Shanghai suddenly experienced high heat on the 18th, the heatwave continued the day before yesterday, with the highest temperature rising to 91 degrees. Although there was a heavy rainstorm with lightning and thunder around 9 PM that night, it only lasted for 20 minutes, and the weather remained extremely hot and stuffy after the rain, making it impossible to sleep. There were more raindrops after midnight, and it gradually cooled down. Yesterday morning, the heat dissipated entirely, but the rain was intermittent, and the weather was extremely bad, due to the influence of low pressure.

### Gatekeeper Beaten to Death by Workers Awaits Inspection by the District Court

Incident Location: Baoshan Road, Died Later at Baolong Hospital

Liu Wanyuan, a 38-year-old gatekeeper from Tianjin at the Dazhong Military Uniform Factory on Baoshan Road in Zhabei, was beaten and injured by several workers the night before last for preventing them from leaving the factory during the designated time. After the North Station Branch Bureau sent police to investigate, three workers were arrested on the spot and taken to the bureau for interrogation and detention. Liu was taken to Baolong Hospital, where he died despite treatment. The hospital reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the autopsy center on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang, appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived at the center. Police officers from the North Station Branch Bureau and the deceased's family also arrived to state that the case had been reported to the District Court, and the Court would also send a prosecutor to examine the body. Mr. Tang stated that according to precedent, the District Court would only request the autopsy file from the First Special District Court and would not send personnel to re-examine the body. Since the Court wanted to re-examine the body, it would be necessary to examine the body twice. Therefore, with the consent of the Police Station, the case was withdrawn pending the examination by the District Court.

### Zhabei Repeatedly Uncovers Drug Cases

At 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the Zhabei North Station Branch Bureau, together with Japanese Consul's representatives Mura Zhenfu and Hashimoto Iwa, raided a drug den at No. 9 Junye Lane, Baoyuan Road, and arrested Han Shunyoku (31 years old), a Korean woman, and seized a large package of heroin, 17 small packages, seals, bronze keys, and other evidence. After a brief interrogation, the witnesses and evidence were taken back to the Consulate by Japanese official Hashimoto Iwa for further investigation.

It was also reported that both the Yongxing Road and North Sichuan Road police stations seized more than ten and twenty drug offenders, respectively, yesterday. One of them, Zhang Zhaodi, a young woman from Wuxi, 18 years old, was arrested by Police Chief Zhang of the Chuan Highway Police Station in Xiangyu Lane, Qiujiang Road. Forty-four small packages of heroin were found on her person. A formal document was prepared and she was handed over to the General Bureau for interrogation.

### Financial Institutions Handling Inland Loans

The Anhui Agricultural Warehouse, the China Agricultural Loan Syndicate, the Bank of China, and the Agricultural Bank of China are allocating funds to handle agricultural warehouse loans in Anhui Province. This year, the allocations are: ① China Agricultural Loan Syndicate: 1 million yuan, ② Bank of China: 1.5 million yuan, ③ Agricultural Bank of China: 1.9 million yuan, totaling 4.4 million yuan. The loans will be managed by the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction's Agricultural Association Management Office. County agricultural warehouses will be established in each county, and provincial agricultural warehouses will be established in convenient transportation locations. It is stipulated that county agricultural warehouses will handle secured loans for various agricultural products, and provincial agricultural associations will handle secured loans, as well as sales and transportation loans. The method is that farmers can store agricultural products such as rice and wheat in the agricultural warehouses at any time, and the monthly interest rate is 8.5%. The loans will begin to be issued this year after the new wheat is harvested.

The spring cocoons of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been successively put on the market in Wuxi. Silk cocoon merchants and remnant cocoon merchants, because the various banks and money houses this year did not jointly form a syndicate to handle cocoon collection loans, handled them separately. They have already contacted various banks and money houses with whom they have past dealings to negotiate loans. According to banking sources, the yield of spring cocoons in Wuxi this year is greater than last year. Banks such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank are all handling cocoon collection loans in that area, and silk cocoon factories are actively seeking loans. Last year, the Cocoon Collection Loan Syndicate loaned out a total of more than 8 million yuan in that area. It is expected that the amount loaned out this year will reach about 10 million yuan, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Jiangsu lending out the most on average, followed by the Farmers Bank.

### Zhou Huilin's Embezzlement of Inheritance Verdict

Fines Imposed Separately

After the death of the late wealthy businessman Xi Lanqing of Pudong, he left behind a great deal of property. His concubine, Zhou Huilin, colluded with Hu Shulin, Fu Minqi, Peng Ren, and others to embezzle Xi's property. Xi's children became aware of this and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, filing a public prosecution with the First Special District Court. Xi's children also retained lawyers Qin Liankui, Ma Sunhua, and others to file a private prosecution. The case was tried by the Special Court and a verdict was awaited. It was announced in this newspaper that yesterday morning was the date for the verdict. Police Station lawyer Ru Bao Yi and defendant lawyer Yu Xiangqin were both in court. Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court and ruled that Hu Shulin and Fu Jiafu (i.e., Fu Minqi) were each fined 1,000 yuan for continuous joint embezzlement. Xi Zhou Shi (i.e., Zhou Huilin) was fined 800 yuan for continuous joint embezzlement. If she opts for labor service, the total fine amount will be proportional to six months. Xi Zhou Shi received a two-year suspended sentence. Peng Ren was fined 300 yuan for attempted joint embezzlement. The remaining lawsuits were not accepted, and part of the attached civil lawsuit was dismissed, and part was transferred to the civil court.

### Autopsy of Female Guest's Suicide at New Asia Hotel

At the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road and Tiantong Road on the evening of the 18th of this month, a young female guest dressed in fashionable clothes committed suicide by swallowing opium in room No. 122. The waiter, Zhang Chunlin, discovered her and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, who summoned an ambulance to the scene and rushed her to the Shanghai Nursing Hospital for treatment. The details were reported in the newspaper. Detective Feng Qi of the Police Station's Chinese section investigated and learned that the woman's name was Wu Luli, 19 years old, from Guangdong. She lost her parents at a young age and now resides with her cousin, Li Huijun, at No. 3 Jinyun Lane, Disiwei Road. The woman had recently been very close to a man named Fu, but the two suddenly had an argument when the man visited her a few days ago. The man left in anger, so Wu's sudden suicide may have been caused by this. Wu died at 3:30 AM yesterday morning due to the poison entering her lungs, and all efforts to save her failed. The body was taken to the autopsy center on Fielun Road. Around 10 AM, Prosecutor Tang, appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived at the center to examine the body. After Sergeant Pan reported the previous situation, Mr. Tang declared that the deceased, Wu Luli, a female, had indeed died from taking opium. The body was released to her cousin, Li Huijun, after she signed a statement.

It was not until yesterday morning that his colleagues discovered him and rushed him to the hospital for treatment. His condition is very critical.

Wang Gencai

Wang Gencai, 17 years old, from Ningbo, is an apprentice at a shop at No. 273 Broadway Road. Yesterday morning, the shop staff suddenly heard Wang moaning.

Ding Fuxiang

Ding Fuxiang, 30 years old, from Changzhou, lives at No. 21 Runfu Lane, Parker Road. Yesterday morning, his family discovered that Ding's expression was strange.

This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, Wu Qiding, Director of the Taxation Bureau, sent a letter to Director Shen, stating that the defendant's counterfeiting of sorghum stamp duty stamps and tax certificates and selling them to a large liquor merchant for mixed use had greatly affected tax revenue. He requested that the principal and accessory offenders be strictly investigated and punished to the fullest extent of the law to protect national taxes. After interrogating the defendant Jin Zhigang, he stated that the counterfeit tobacco and alcohol stamp duty stamps were ordered by an unknown customer and that he did not know it was illegal. His testimony was extremely cunning. He has been presented to the District Court for interrogation.

### Two Women Who Sold Drugs Await Sentencing

### Jin Cheng Bank's Business Report for 1936 (Continued)

Speaking of the ranking of various countries in terms of their share of imports, the most noteworthy is that the United Kingdom fell to fourth place with 11.7%, while Germany jumped to third place with 5.91%. Japan remained in second place with 16.26% (excluding smuggling), and the United States steadily occupied the top spot with 19.64%. As for the share of export value, the United States also ranked first with 26.36%, followed by Hong Kong with 15.07%, Japan with 14.48%, the United Kingdom with 9.18%, Germany with 5.54%, and France with 4.30%. All import and export figures increased compared to the previous year, with the only characteristic being a trade surplus of 809,000 yuan with the United States. In terms of the ranking of import ports, Shanghai still ranked first with 58.78%, followed by Tianjin with 7.69%, and Kowloon with 6.09%. The ranking of export ports was also Shanghai with 51.26%, Tianjin with 16.67%, and Jiaozhou with 7.29%, ranking first, second, and third, respectively. Among them, except for the decrease in imports from Tianjin and Kowloon and exports from Jiaozhou compared to the previous year, the imports and exports from Shanghai and the exports from Tianjin all continued to increase compared to the previous year. However, there is still a cause for dissatisfaction with our foreign trade this year, and the trade statistics must be revised accordingly, namely, the increasingly rampant smuggling in North China compared to previous years, estimated by customs to be as high as 310 million yuan. The impact on central China is also affected. This not only has a huge impact on tax revenue, but also poses a threat to our general economy.

(Ji) Transportation Construction During times of economic recession, many governments organize public works to provide relief. Although scholars debate extensively, the actual results cannot be concealed. The Soviet Union implemented two five-year plans, and the national economy flourished. Germany implemented a four-year plan, and unemployment decreased. These are all very obvious examples. China's economic construction has made great progress in recent years, and the achievements this year are particularly remarkable. This is due to the success of the new currency system this year and the abundant harvest of agricultural products, which are the three major factors for economic improvement. The progress of China's transportation construction this year is briefly described below.

(Zi) Railways The most commendable achievement in China's transportation construction last year was the completion of the Yuehan Railway. This railway is the only major trunk line in China connecting north and south, with 89 stations of all sizes along the line, a population of approximately 13 million, fertile land, and abundant products. It is an important lifeline of China. Secondary to this is the progress of the Jinggan and Zhegan railways. The former is actively advancing and has reached Xuancheng. It is expected to be completed in 1938. The latter has passed Nanchang and is being extended westward. Once it reaches Pingxiang, it can be connected to the Yuehan Railway via the Zhuping Railway. In the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is being built. At the same time, the Xi'an-Baoji section of the Longhai Railway has also been completed. After turning south, entering Sichuan from Shaanxi, and with the Xiangqian Railway also under construction, the two major east-west trunk lines north and south of the Yangtze River will be completed. This has a great impact on national defense and the national economy. In addition, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has obtained British loans, so the Hangzhou-Cao'e section and the two major bridges, Qianjiang and Cao'ejiang, are being actively built. The Sujia Road has also been opened to traffic. Other branch lines, such as the Bengbu-Zhengzhou branch line, have either begun surveying or are being planned for construction, each with its own significant meaning and hope.

(Chou) Highways The progress of highway construction in China in recent years is astonishing. Continued progress was seen this year. The Xiangchuan, Dianqian, Chuanxian, and Duxin roads on the border of Yu'e have been completed. The Hujia and Sujia roads in Jiangsu, the Pingda, Jinbao, Jinyan, Cangyan roads in Hebei, and the Songsui road in Shaanxi have been opened to traffic. Other provincial highways are either being actively promoted, planned for addition, or undergoing old road renovation, all of which are making great contributions to transportation construction. According to the National Economic Committee's supervision of the eight-province interprovincial highway, as of the end of December, more than 23,800 kilometers had been completed and opened to traffic. Approximately 26,000 kilometers are under construction, so the total length of interconnected highways nationwide can reach 100,000 kilometers.

(Yin) Aviation China's aviation industry has made progress year by year. This year, the opening of the Guangyong and Guanghe routes, the extension of the Xian-Rong route to Kunming and renaming it the Shaan-Kun route, the extension of the Shanghai-Guangdong route to Hong Kong, and other international air routes have also begun, all of which are significant achievements.

(Mao) Shipping This year, the Yangtze River shipping industry was sluggish in the first half of the year, but in the second half of the year, due to the abundant harvest of farmland along the coast and the increase in people's purchasing power, the shipment of goods from Shanghai was very high, which led to the development of various shipping companies. With the proliferation of smuggled goods in North China, sea transport was greatly affected. The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has undergone reorganization and has made considerable progress in consolidation. At the same time, it is actively completing the land-sea intermodal transportation network. The Ministry of Communications' promulgation of regulations for the reorganization of privately owned shipping companies and the formulation of shipbuilding incentive regulations are also new initiatives that benefit the shipping industry.

(Chen) Postal and Telecommunications Although China's telecommunications funding is very difficult, the increase in long-distance telephone lines this year still reached 5,709 kilometers, and approximately 100 long-distance telephone bureaus were opened. Wireless telephones have directly reached various cities in Japan, and trial calls to San Francisco and London have also been successful. 2,800 kilometers of new wired telegraph lines have been built. Many new domestic radio stations have also been added. The expansion of postal routes has reached more than 21,000 kilometers, with more than 6,000 new bureaus established. Postal services in border areas have also been developed. All of these promote the rapid development of modern transportation to meet current needs. (To be continued)

### "Culture City"

— Xiao Mei

Since objects and people began moving south, the famous scholars of Beiping felt their lives and property were endangered, and they clamored to turn Beiping into a "Culture City." This idea was proposed several years ago, and it seemed to have been "shelved without further discussion," so we forgot about it. It was only when we saw news in the newspapers about "friendly" tank formations entering the city that we couldn't help but think about the fate of this ancient city and the "Culture City" that the famous scholars had once worked so hard to create.

Now, the wishes of the famous scholars have been fulfilled, perhaps as a result of "hard work and dedication." According to the newspapers, Beiping will not only become a "Culture City," but under the efforts of the authorities, there is also the ambition to "make Beiping the 'Number One in the East,' a cultural and scenic area." It is also said that "the Hebei-Chahar authorities have also ordered the municipal authorities to engage in various tasks to improve the city's appearance and enhance sanitation."

Will this great endeavor be as enduring as the Great Wall? But let's leave that aside for now and first take a look at that paragraph in an "aviation news report":

"Beiping, known as a world-famous ancient city, has seen its people's livelihoods and economy decline since the capital moved south, but its scenic spots remain, and its scenery has not faded. People from all over the world who come to the East for sightseeing invariably consider a visit to Beiping a pleasure. This spring alone, there have been four 'World Tour Groups' arriving one after another, totaling more than 2,000 people, who directly and indirectly spent a considerable amount of money here, greatly benefiting society and the people's livelihood. International reputation has also been enhanced by this 'Culture City.'... The authorities, recognizing this, are absolutely unwilling to let this ancient capital fall into disrepair. The second phase of the Capital Culture Renovation Committee's project has a budget of more than 2 million, with central financial and railway departments allocating 60% of the funds, which shows the government's emphasis..."

This is also true in a way. Although the landscape may change color, the scenery remains the same. "People from all over the world who come to the East for sightseeing" still "invariably consider a visit to Beiping a pleasure," don't they? If this world-famous "Culture City" were destroyed in the fires of war, regardless of society and the people's livelihood, wouldn't the "international reputation" also decline due to the destruction of the "Culture City"? That would be terrible! Although it might be described as "preserving the tile" rather than "shattering the jade," "the circumstances are special," so there should be an exception.

However, do all the visitors from around the world come solely for the "scenic spots that remain and the scenery that has not faded?" That depends on each individual's perspective. In my view, perhaps they do, but perhaps they don't. Although some Chinese people use the guise of investigation to actually enjoy the scenery, many "people from around the world" use the guise of travel to actually conduct investigations. Don't we see "friendly" people often penetrating deep into the hinterland, taking photographs and measurements, and calling it travel? And since the "circumstances became special," this ancient "Culture City" has attracted even more attention from the world. Some come out of curiosity to take a look, while others want to see how "special" it has become and make a special visit. Although this "greatly benefits" society and the people's livelihood, a question mark should be placed after "international reputation has also been enhanced by this 'Culture City.'"

Naturally, Beiping is still nominally part of China, so how can we "encourage the ambition of others" by losing heart first? Actively building it up is precisely to show that we will never give up. That's good, and I hope it will be so. However, one cannot help but ask:

What if the "friendly" army "exercises" and enters the city again?

And now we are going to "make Beiping the 'Number One in the East' cultural and scenic area."

### At the Bixiguli Sawmill

— Li Liwen

Those times, probably eight years ago, I was drifting around the Bixiguli sawmill area like duckweed, seeking employment. I was temporarily working as a lumberjack in the sawmill. Although the wages were meager, I was content with that kind of life. I loved the tranquility and the warm friendship of my companions.

It was a small, remote suburb surrounded by tall forests and a circular Hengsha River, which seemed to completely isolate it from the outside world. During the day, apart from the rumble of trams crossing the iron bridge over the river, only the sounds of birds in the forest and the monotonous sound of sawing mingled with the songs of the workers showed a hint of life there. At night, when that huge black shadow arrived, everything in Bixiguli became even quieter. However, in the forests along the Hengsha River, on the plains where shallow green grass grew, it seemed even more lively than during the day. Every evening, the workers lit bonfires by the river, sat around and told each other about their strange hearings and encounters. Sometimes they gambled, or competed in various games. They didn't suggest going back to the narrow, wood-smelling huts in the forest until they felt their eyelids getting heavy.

How primitive and pure it seemed! I lingered by the firelight, cherishing the simple hearts of those companions... I almost didn't want to move on. I would rather rot myself in that quiet but loving place...

However, my stubborn nature could not bear the intimidation of the whip. One day, because a companion went to swim in the river during working hours, the overseer, a Dutchman, unleashed his uncontrollable bestiality. Under the whipping and kicking of the whip and leather shoes, no matter how docile the companion was, an uncontrollable spark of anger erupted from the depths of my chest. Without a word, I walked over, snatched the overseer's whip, and threw it into the river. The overseer became indescribably furious, grabbed a wooden stake and charged at me. I stood under the saw frame, drew my saber, and calmly waited for his attack.

"Rogue! Bastard! Get out now!"

The overseer roared, dropped the wooden stake, and strode towards the wooden house that served as an office.

"How is it?"

I glanced triumphantly at my companions, sheathed my saber, and walked back to the small wooden hut...

That afternoon, when I boarded the ship carrying lumber to the city, my companions ran over to surround me, kissed me, patted me on the shoulder...

### Page 18

Xia Ming, the injured companion, suddenly handed me a small package:

"This is what everyone wanted to give you, ha..."

Xia Ming fell to the ground, kissed my trouser legs, and began to cry.

I opened the package, and inside was a wad of guilders. Moved by the expression of rare friendship, I also began to shed tears.

"Comrades, you are wrong. Why should I take your money? Isn't your money earned with sweat? I still have strong hands and a body, please take it back!" I said loudly.

No one answered! After a long time, Wula, the middle-aged man respected as the elder brother, stepped forward and slapped my outstretched hand back:

"Take it quickly! Here, although it's just a little, we can always not worry about food. You, Silanpei, you are going to live a wandering life again..."

... When the ship sailed, I was completely buried in tears. Barely opening my eyes and looking towards the blurry shore, I saw many hands waving.

"Goodbye, comrades!" I shouted loudly, waving my hat towards the shore.

In my ears, I also heard a loud shout, that shout that tugged at my heart:

"Goodbye, comrades!"

### Starting with a Foreign "Golden Jade Slave"

— Wu Ci

Recently, theater performances have become very popular in Shanghai's fashionable society—especially foreigners performing Chinese plays and Chinese people performing foreign plays. Of course, there is interest in them. Xue Pinggui speaking fluent English, and Golden Jade Slave with blue eyes and a high nose—these are things that make people laugh just thinking about them. For example, the other day the International Art Troupe performed "China Night" at the Lyceum Theatre. The program included Jewish people performing "The Emperor's Night Out with Li Feng," and Chinese people performing "The Honeymoon" with English dialogue... According to reports, that evening "six or seven hundred Chinese and Western audience members attended, and the upper and lower floors were completely packed, making for a lively scene."

The lively atmosphere is not without reason. Human psychology is generally uneasy with boredom. This is not only true for Chinese people, but Chinese people express it more openly. If a very minor incident occurs on the street, such as catching a pickpocket or someone tripping and falling, a crowd will immediately gather and will not disperse for a long time. Therefore, on the night of the British King's coronation, even though there were Indian policemen whipping people, there were still enormous crowds. All of this is due to the monotony of life and the desire to find some excitement. The ways they seek excitement vary depending on the person and the place. In the small-town environment it is strolling the streets and watching grand funerals, while in bourgeois society, it is dancing and watching plays.

However, dancing and watching plays also become boring after a while. At this point, ordinary social dances are not stimulating enough. There must be "blackout dances" or "hula dances." Watching Peking opera and civilized plays is also just the same old thing. There must be Xue Pinggui speaking in a foreign accent to make it interesting. Mr. Xiong Shiyi's Wang Baochuan is very popular abroad for the same reason.

What artistic achievement do such plays have? That is difficult to say. Because what people gain from watching the plays is no longer artistic appreciation, but a novel stimulus. This stimulus can also become numb as novelty becomes old.

Therefore, one must be extremely bored to watch such plays, and one must also be extremely bored to perform such plays.

Although it is boring, I do not deny this spirit of seeking stimulation. In fact, it is a bourgeois reaction. The so-called seeking stimulation is an expression of unease with reality. Most people, except those with numb nerves, have a spirit of progress. If this spirit is properly developed, it will lead to creating a rigorous life for oneself and creating light for humanity. But now, they are avoiding and retreating, letting novelty stimulate them. Later, like opium addicts, they become addicted. They cannot live without stimulation, but after too much stimulation, the nerves will become numb. As time goes on, even that bit of rebellious spirit of seeking stimulation will be eroded. Humans have souls, but at that time, the soul will hide, like an ignorant animal.

This is truly pitiful!

### Vegetable Garden

— Nan Ou

Five miles outside the noisy and bustling market, lies a small vegetable garden, quietly basking in the hot sun and enclosed by a bamboo fence. The fence belongs to Ye Renlin Zhenji, as most people nearby know.

Lin Zhenji, a Fujianese, is short and very strong. He is approaching middle age, has a shaved head, and looks very honest. In the corner of the garden, there is a thatched hut that took great effort to build, where the five of them live. Lin Zhenji's wife brought a son and a daughter with her when she came from "Tangshan" three years ago. The older child was five years old, and the younger was three. Last year, she gave birth to another boy in this thatched hut, a round and chubby face with eyes that squinted into a line when he smiled, just like Lin Zhenji's wife's eyes. Now, she is seven months pregnant again. Her belly is protruding outwards, and she cannot help Lin Zhenji with his work. In the past, every morning, very early, when people were still tossing and turning in their dreams, the couple would get up, gently get out of bed, afraid of disturbing the children, tiptoe outside. The sky was just beginning to dawn, and a few stars still lingered in the corner of the sky. They would start working for the vegetable garden: watering, catching vegetable worms, or splashing some fertilizer. Then, they would pick a load of tender vegetables, which Lin Zhenji would carry to the market. By this time, the children would be awake. After Lin Zhenji left, she would go to the thatched hut to take care of the children, cook, and wash clothes. Lin Zhenji would sell the vegetables and rush home for breakfast. Sometimes if business was good, he would bring back some fish or meat for the children to eat their fill.

They lived like this, and life in the vegetable garden was so peaceful.

Ten years ago, Lin Zhenji was even stronger and younger than he is now. He carried his baggage to this unfamiliar land. In order to make a living, he worked diligently and frugally wherever he could find work. Five years later, he returned to Fujian and married his current wife. After staying in his hometown for a while, the hardships of life forced him to leave his hometown again and come to this foreign land to cultivate a vegetable garden. At that time, the market was not as bustling as it is now, and Lin Zhenji's income was not as high as it is now. Later, his wife came, and with their combined efforts, they planted more vegetables. Sometimes they would stand in the vegetable garden, watching the vegetables grow, and they would both smile involuntarily.

But one day, as Lin Zhenji sat in front of the thatched hut, smoking after breakfast, two people came, one with blue eyes and yellow hair, and the other a Chinese man. The Chinese man asked Lin Zhenji in Malay:

"Is this Lin Zhenji's vegetable garden? Are you Lin Zhenji?"

"Yes," Lin Zhenji replied. The sudden questions made the honest Lin Zhenji unsure of what to do. His wife, with her big belly, also came out and asked, "What's going on? What's this all about?"

The Chinese man explained his purpose: The colonial government felt that the market here was becoming increasingly prosperous and that greater security equipment was needed to maintain order. Therefore, they wanted to build barracks in this area. Lin Zhenji's vegetable garden was within the zone designated by the government, so they had come to notify him to move within three weeks. The government could issue ship tickets for his family of five, and they could return to China for free. After saying this, he handed Lin Zhenji a document that he could not understand.

But Lin Zhenji exclaimed:

"This is my vegetable garden. I don't want to go back to China!"

The two men ignored him, turned around, and left. Lin Zhenji stood there stunned for a long time before looking at the document, then at his wife and the children surrounding him.

Five years of hard work were exchanged for this ticket back home. Living on someone else's land, what security can you have?

That night, Lin Zhenji shed tears for the first time since coming overseas.
