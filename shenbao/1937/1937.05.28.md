Nakamura Indicates Willingness to Resolve Peacefully - Japanese Foreign Ministry Issues New Instructions - Instructing Japanese Officials to Lodge a Second Protest

[Guangzhou] The Japanese Consul-General Nakamura visited Diao Zuoqian on the 27th to exchange views, indicating a willingness to resolve the Swatow case peacefully. Ling Shifen, secretary of the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office, is scheduled to fly to Swatow on the 28th to investigate the truth. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)

[Hong Kong] The Japanese Consul Nakamura stationed in Guangdong Province went to the provincial government on the morning of the 27th to discuss the Swatow case. He was received by Ouyang Ju, who replied that according to reports from all sides, the incident was due to Japanese consulate staff not following residence procedures and assaulting Chinese police officers. The Swatow police have always been well-trained and have been diligent in protecting foreigners. There is no reason for them to assault Japanese first. He requested the Japanese Consul to instruct the Japanese residents in Swatow to respect Chinese police authority in order to maintain friendship. (Special dispatch, 27th)

[Hong Kong] Diao Zuoqian said on the 27th that the Swatow case could be resolved locally. He is scheduled to go to Swatow within a day or two to investigate the truth. (Special dispatch, 27th)

[Hong Kong] On the 27th, the Pacification Commissioner's Office dispatched Wu Wenxian, and the Provincial Government dispatched Zhang Yuannan, to fly to Swatow to convey instructions to local military and government officials regarding the confidential handling of the case of Japanese assaulting police officers. (Special dispatch, 27th)

[Nanjing] Regarding the Swatow incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to receive telegrams on the 27th stating that six Japanese warships are still anchored. Diao Zuoqian is prepared to go to Swatow immediately to investigate and should be able to resolve the matter based on accurate facts and the nature of a local incident. (Special dispatch, 27th)

[Guangzhou] The Guangdong Provincial Government dispatched Councilor Zhang Yuannan to Swatow on the morning of the 27th to investigate the truth of the case of Japanese national Aoyama assaulting a Chinese police officer. After arriving in Swatow, Zhang will go to the municipal government and relevant agencies to begin the investigation and report everything to the provincial government. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)

[Tokyo] Today, Japanese newspapers continue to express indignation over the Swatow incident. The statement of the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been published by almost all newspapers, some printing the full text and others only a part. However, the Taihoku Nippo newspaper has misinterpreted the statement of the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the editorials of Chinese newspapers, considering it a "new manifestation of a strong anti-Japanese movement." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued new instructions to Japanese High Commissioner and Nakamura this morning, reportedly instructing them to lodge a second protest but warning them not to publish any criticism, reportedly because they do not want to engage in a "propaganda war." An editorial in the Jiji Shinpo newspaper warned China not to be misled by Japan's superficial lack of control and international isolation and to be vigilant against the underlying current in Japan. The newspaper then advised the Japanese government to adopt a cooperative and cautious attitude towards such minor and local incidents, stating that a fundamental resolution of such incidents is impossible under the current circumstances. Furthermore, Japan's demands would be in vain without the comprehensive power of diplomacy as a strong backing. The prerequisite for this includes Japan's internal rectification and the improvement of national strength. It is impermissible to be angry without such conditions. The newspaper concluded that the most important thing in this movement is self-respect and gradually seeking China's self-reflection, while at the same time preparing for a fundamental solution.

(Special dispatch, 27th)

[Nanjing] Regarding the case of delayed remittance of Sichuan relief funds, the Relief Committee recently submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, stating the process of selling Sichuan relief public bonds and remitting funds, saying that on the one hand, it was at Liu Hangchen's request to wait for a good price to sell in order to obtain more relief funds, and on the other hand, it was because the local relief fund of one million yuan had not yet been fully raised, so it waited a little. It is rumored that the Executive Yuan believes that it is necessary to thoroughly understand who is responsible for the delay and has appointed special commissioners to begin a thorough investigation. In addition, Central Committee member Luo Jialun raised questions about the delay in Sichuan relief funds to the Central Political Council, and Chairman Wang and other members urged the Executive Yuan to thoroughly investigate to determine responsibility.

Ministry of Finance Issues Order to Increase Cotton Yarn Unified Tax Rate

To be Implemented from June 1

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance has set a rate to implement an increase in the cotton yarn unified tax from June 1 of this year and issued an order on the 27th to the Taxation Administration, the Unified Tax Bureaus of various districts, the Tax Bureaus, and the Unified Tax Management Offices and Tax Management Offices of various sub-districts to comply. The original order is recorded as follows: It has been six years since the cotton yarn unified tax was launched. Regarding the tax rate, there have been no changes. In recent years, yarn prices have risen sharply, and the tax rate is only about 3% of the value on average compared with the selling price. Compared with other unified tax goods, the burden is the lightest. The current economic construction is waiting to be carried out, and funds are urgently needed. It is necessary to increase the cotton yarn unified tax rate appropriately. Also, the cotton yarn unified tax has been collected in two levels with 23 counts as the boundary. Because the classification is too simple, it is difficult to equalize the burden. This time, it should also be appropriately improved at the same time to show fairness. The case has been submitted to the 304th meeting of the Executive Yuan for approval, and the 39th meeting of the Central Political Council decided to hand it over to the ministry for trial implementation. The tax rate is as follows: ㊀ Grade A yarn (not more than 17 counts), unified tax of 5 yuan in national currency per 100 kilograms, ㊁ Grade B yarn (more than 17 counts to 23 counts), unified tax of 5 yuan and 7.5 cents per 100 kilograms, ㊂ Grade C yarn (more than 23 counts to 35 counts) Unified tax of 7 yuan and 5 cents per 100 kilograms, ㊃ Grade D yarn (more than 35 counts) Unified tax of 10 yuan in national currency per 100 kilograms. The above-mentioned cotton yarn unified tax rate is hereby set to be implemented on June 1 of this year. The transitional measures for the new and old tax rates should be verified and ordered by the Taxation Administration. It is responsible for properly verifying and handling the matter. In addition to the distribution, you should immediately comply with this order and transfer the order to all subordinates for knowledge. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)

### On the National Defense Line (8)

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shu Di

㊄ A Record of Meeting Mr. Zhao Cilong

In a society like Shanxi that values governance by people, or rather, in a Chinese society that values people and governance by people, a morally upright and impeccably honest figure will inevitably be admired by everyone. This is inevitable. The most fitting example is Mr. Zhao Cilong, the current chairman of the provincial government. Mr. Zhao has been in politics in Shanxi for twenty or thirty years, and it is said that there is not a single thing that can be criticized about him. Therefore, he has earned the title of "Sage" from everyone. He has a relationship with Mr. Yan Xishan that is half teacher, half friend. During the late Qing Dynasty, when they were studying in Japan, they were old comrades of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). In recent years in Shanxi, they have always been together. Especially when the political situation in Shanxi changed in 1930 and Mr. Yan left, the responsibility of maintaining Shanxi fell entirely on Mr. Zhao. His reputation during that period is still praised by everyone today. He is already over seventy years old this year, but he is still very vigorous, getting up at four o'clock every morning and personally participating in many things, without shying away from hard work. Supporting a society like Shanxi requires such a model figure of experience and wisdom.

Currently, almost all the authorities in Shanxi province are juniors of Mr. Yan Xishan. There are only two people who can sit on an equal footing with Mr. Yan. One is Mr. Kong Fanwei, the current salt commissioner of Hedong, and the other is Mr. Zhao. When Mr. Yan mentions Mr. Zhao to those close to him, he often refers to him as "Old Gentleman, Old Gentleman."

Thinking about the difficulties currently facing Shanxi, thinking about the advice he has sought, and thinking about the role Mr. Zhao has played in all of this, I decided to meet him once to express my respect.

When I mentioned my intention to meet Mr. Zhao to a friend, this friend immediately stood up, grabbed his hat, and put it on his head, saying:

"That's great, I'll go and tell him for you right away. Old Mr. Zhao is very fond of meeting guests from outside. The question is whether he has time."

At five o'clock in the afternoon of the next day, my friend and I arrived at the provincial government on time.

We first sat in a reception room. This was not a very large room, with good lighting. In the middle of the room, there were four or five square tables placed together and covered with white tablecloths. There were rows of chairs on both sides of the tables, as if a meeting had just been held. In one corner of the room, there were several pots of flowers with flower petals (perhaps some kind of evergreen tree). In another corner of the room, there was a bookshelf. I began to look around the room, which had no other decorations. Gradually, a look of surprise appeared on my face.

"What's wrong?" My friend seemed to notice my expression.

"This..."

"Very simple, isn't it? This shows the characteristics of Old Mr. Zhao."

After a short while, we were led into another reception room. Just as we were about to enter, my friend nudged me and said in a low voice:

"The Old Gentleman has been coughing up blood these past two days and has a problem with his throat. He probably finds it difficult to talk for too long, so we can talk for a little while."

I stopped and a look of doubt appeared on my face. "Hmm?"

"No," my friend quickly explained in a low voice. "You have to know, if the Old Gentleman gets into a good conversation, he might go on and on. Wouldn't that be too tiring for him?"

The thick and heavy blue cloth cotton curtain was lifted by a guard with the full strength of both arms. I slightly bent my waist and stepped inside. As a result, a part of the entrance to this room was covered by a half-body, creating a shadow. However, as soon as I fixed my gaze, I immediately recognized that in this shadow was a kind-faced old gentleman, holding a string of Buddhist prayer beads in one hand and already holding his other hand outstretched in the air. - This was Mr. Zhao Cilong, whom I was about to meet. I quickly focused my mind, stopped my steps, and also extended my right hand.

Mr. Zhao's right hand, which I had just shaken, was now joined with his left hand and placed in front of his chest, repeatedly bowing. Under his repeated bows, I was led to the seat of honor. Everything happened so quickly that I didn't even have the chance to express my intention to sit casually.

Looking at my friend's respectful expression towards Mr. Zhao, and facing this kind-faced elder, I, who was sitting calmly in the seat of honor, now felt very uneasy. However, at this moment, Mr. Zhao was already speaking eloquently.

(The first impression immediately left in my mind: Here, I have met a typical figure deeply influenced by Chinese etiquette and civilization).

While he was speaking, I responded while observing Mr. Zhao: he was wearing a Xinghuang serge uniform made in Shanxi province. The collar was neatly buttoned up, and it seemed a bit high, as if it was squeezing his Adam's apple uncomfortably. He had a white beard, and his hair seemed very sparse, so I couldn't remember if it was white, black, or gray. Therefore, I also couldn't tell if it was a flat top or a monk's hairstyle. My eyes were fixed on Mr. Zhao, and I couldn't find a moment to see what kind of shoes he was wearing. However, I guessed that they must be cloth shoes because they didn't make a rustling sound when he walked. (Wearing a uniform with cloth shoes is a common phenomenon among public officials in Shanxi. I guess the reason is partly because they don't want to wear imported leather shoes like public officials elsewhere, and partly because the leather factories in Shanxi province can't fully supply them. I have not discussed this guess with my friends in Shanxi, so I don't know if it is correct). Mr. Zhao had many wrinkles on his face and was not very tall. He looked a bit gaunt, but as soon as he started speaking, I immediately saw the vigor in his eyebrows and was amazed by the loudness of his voice. However, he still seemed afraid that his voice was too low and would cause misunderstanding from the guests, so he repeatedly declared:

"My throat has been a bit sore these past two days, my throat has been a bit sore these past two days."

At this time, I confirmed what many friends had said: Mr. Zhao's loud voice makes him the most suitable figure in Shanxi to speak to large crowds.

Current Commentary

### The Problem of Renewed Interest Rate Cuts

— Ren

Thanks to the implementation of the new currency system and the stimulus of the world economic recovery, China's economy has recently shown signs of recovery. The previously desolate industries and businesses are seizing the opportunity to revive and await recovery. The five years of gloom that enveloped the economy is about to dissipate, which can be predicted. However, at this time when the old difficulties remain and the new prosperity has not yet arrived, the transition period deserves the most attention. If measures are taken carelessly, the nearly achieved success could be ruined. This is because today's China is very different from other countries. Economic sovereignty is restricted by unequal treaties, and in terms of finance and industry, foreign powers have been eyeing opportunities and are ready to take advantage of any opportunity to seize undue rights and interests and substantial resources, crowding out domestic businesses and gaining an advantage. Therefore, the slightly improved economic environment may be exploited by foreigners.

This phenomenon has been occurring frequently in the past dozen months. The aggressive entry and exit of Japanese businesses in China is self-evident. The recent successive interest rate cuts by foreign banks is also a notable example. Among foreign banks, the Central Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Bank of California, Citibank, Bank of Taiwan, Bank of Korea, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Banque Franco-Chinoise, National Bank of Germany, and others have focused on international remittances. Before the currency reform, remittance businesses in Sichuan, Guangdong, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou were mostly controlled by these foreign banks. However, after the currency reform, exchange rates stabilized and domestic markets gradually recovered. As a result, these banks, which had previously manipulated China's foreign exchange, shifted their focus and used their substantial capital to advance into industry and commerce. Since May of last year, they have repeatedly reduced interest rates on overdrafts, from 6% per week to 5%, then to 3%, and most recently to 1%. The intention behind this is to facilitate the development of their home country's industries and businesses in China.

However, while the interest rate cuts by foreign banks make it easier for their home country's industries and businesses, they also make it more difficult for China's industries and businesses. According to our recent survey, the current interest rates for current accounts at commercial banks are typically around 2% to 4% per month, while overdraft interest rates are between 6% and 9%. This translates to 7% to over 10% per week, which is vastly different from the overdraft interest rates of foreign banks. From the perspective of industry and commerce, Chinese businesses today pay 6 to 9 yuan more in interest per 100 yuan than foreign businesses. How can Chinese businesses compete with foreign businesses under these conditions? Therefore, the only solution is for Chinese banks to also lower their interest rates.

But how can Chinese banks lower their overdraft interest rates? The answer must be to first lower their deposit interest rates. And how can deposit interest rates be lowered? This issue has been discussed by the public for over a year, but in reality, commercial banks have not lowered their interest rates. Recently, influenced by the interest rate cuts by foreign banks, there has been a flurry of discussions about interest rate cuts in the banking industry. Whether this will be implemented in the future is currently unknown. However, we believe that there is a major obstacle to lowering deposit interest rates, which is that commercial banks are deeply afraid that their deposits will be absorbed by government-owned banks after deposit interest rates are lowered. Therefore, they have been hesitant to take action. This concern is understandable from a commercial perspective. The solution is for government-owned banks to lead by example and lower deposit interest rates first, alleviating the concerns of commercial banks and allowing them to lower their deposit rates as well. Once deposit interest rates are low, overdraft interest rates will naturally fall. This is an inevitable logic. Without this, the plan for interest rate cuts will likely not be realized.

### Parisian Aviators Reattempt Flight to Tokyo

Three More Pilots Prepare to Depart Soon; The Doumergues Are Recuperating from Minor Injuries

[Paris] After French aviators Doumergue and Micheletti failed in their attempt to fly from Paris to Tokyo in under 100 hours, three more pilots - pilot Lagasse, mechanic Brinquin, and radio operator Weibel - have decided to continue the endeavor. Their aircraft will be the "Gull" model manufactured by the Caudron company. They have been actively preparing in recent days and expect to be ready by tomorrow night. As soon as the weather is favorable, they will depart. Lagasse is 38 years old and has served as a pilot for Air France, flying between Vietnam, Saigon, and Damascus, Syria. He has extensive experience in long-distance flights. Brinquin is a skilled mechanic, and Weibel has repeatedly flown seaplanes to the East and has a wealth of experience. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Kochi The French aviators Doumergue and Micheletti, who were stranded in Kochi Prefecture, Japan, told reporters at the Kochi Red Cross Hospital, "We departed from Shanghai at 1:40 PM. When we were near the Korean coast, it rained heavily, and we lost our bearings. We sent a radio message reporting our situation, but there was no response, and we were unable to find our proper direction. Moreover, because we were running out of fuel, we attempted to land in this area (the coast of Shomuki Village) to wait for our trip to Tokyo. Unfortunately, we encountered this disaster. It is regrettable. Mr. Cabé failed before, and this time we have also failed. We are all unlucky people." (Domei dispatch, 27th)

Kochi This morning, the Doumergues, who underwent surgery at the Kochi Red Cross Hospital, were told by reporters that French aviator Lagasse had announced a plan to avenge their flight. Both Doumergues were moved and told reporters, "Mr. Lagasse and the other two are all our friends. Moreover, the 'Caudron' aircraft is different from our 'Simoun' aircraft. It is a biplane and has a higher safety factor. We wish them success in flying to Japan. However, the air currents near the Japanese coast are particularly bad. Please convey this to them and ask them to pay attention." Doumergue does not consider this flight a failure. As soon as he recovers from his injuries, he will return to Paris to try again.

### Life Begins at Arctic Camp

Greatly Disturbed by Wind and Clouds

[Moscow] Arctic Expeditionary Correspondent Troianowski transmits by wireless from the polar station, "The Arctic camp has begun normal life. After resting, we have rid ourselves of the difficulties of navigation. We are constantly disturbed by wind and snow, and snow dust has invaded our tents. We have had to build snow walls to defend ourselves. The Krenkel radio station is working very well. Everyone is safe and happy. The most meaningful events here have been made into a film. Filming began when the plane landed on the ice floe." (Tass dispatch, 26th)

[Moscow] The world's newspapers are still extensively reporting on the Soviet Arctic expedition. British newspapers provide detailed accounts of how the Arctic wintering camp is organized. The Daily Herald, Stephenson, said that the Russians have made a huge contribution to mankind and have risen to undertake the task that we have been trying to carry out for twenty years. Their success should stimulate the US, Canada, and the British government to subsidize aviation across the Arctic Ocean. The shortest air routes from Moscow to San Francisco and from Chicago to Calcutta both pass through the Arctic.

The New York Times editorial said, "Professor Schmidt's amazing success, his flight to the North Pole and establishment of a polar station there, and the regular transmission of weather forecasts to Moscow are not accidental events, but a new stage in the systematic Soviet conquest of the icy region."

### Japanese Military Decides to Support the Hayashi Cabinet

Minister of the Army Sugiyama Expresses a Strong Attitude, Not Hesitating to Dissolve Parliament Again

[Tokyo] Japanese Minister of the Army Sugiyama Gen, while returning to Tokyo by train this morning, made a statement to the press, arguing that the Hayashi cabinet must have the firm resolve to dissolve the House of Representatives again to cope with the upcoming special parliament. Sugiyama said that he did not believe the rumors that Prime Minister Hayashi had recently changed his views and was preparing to resign. He continued, "The opinion of the majority is not necessarily correct. If someone believes that their own views are correct and without error, then even if others think they are wrong, they should move forward straightforwardly. If the parliament unanimously expresses its disapproval of the government, then 'decisiveness' is the only attitude the government can take." Given the recent two days of discord among cabinet members and the increased resistance from political parties, the rumors that Prime Minister Hayashi is becoming increasingly pessimistic have become louder. Sugiyama's strong stance is worth paying attention to. Tomorrow, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties will hold a joint meeting to launch a no-confidence motion, while about twelve larger right-wing parties and right-wing groups such as the Proletarian Party and the Greater Japan Youth Party, under the leadership of Hashimoto and Kobayashi, will also hold a convention to overthrow existing political parties. Here, we can see a clear division between those who want to maintain the status quo and those who want to break it. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)

### Japanese Radicals Operate in Secret

[Tokyo] Supreme Public Prosecutor Izumi Ninokuma delivered a training speech today at the National Police Chiefs Conference, describing the contrast between the Japanese Communist movement and the Fascist movement. In discussing the Japanese Communist movement, which is generally believed to have disappeared, Izumi said that there are still many remnants of the Japanese Communist Party. They have resolutely changed their strategy and are trying to form a united front with forces that have anti-nationalist tendencies. Izumi continued that these people are using literature, film, and other legal activities to instill their doctrines and ideas into the public. The Japanese Communist Party still has many illegal organizations scattered throughout the districts, secretly engaging in revolutionary movements. Therefore, Izumi warned the police to continue suppressing these dangerous forces and not to slacken. Regarding the Fascist movement or the extreme right-wing movement, Izumi said that since the February 26th incident last year, this movement has been completely re-examined. As a result, they are now using all their power to popularize the movement, aiming to unify and expand the so-called "National Front." While most of this movement is proceeding legally, some radical elements, while acting legally, still firmly believe in and adopt the necessity of illegal means, with violent direct actions occurring from time to time. Izumi warned those present to be vigilant against this movement as well, and specifically suggested that they maintain the closest possible liaison with the military police to observe these elements.

### Egypt Joins the League of Nations, China Expresses Deep Agreement

Delegate Gu Speaks on the League's Mission; All Should Uphold Covenants and Cooperate

[Geneva] At today's League of Nations Assembly, fifty nations unanimously approved Egypt's acquisition of full member status. The President of the current Assembly, the Turkish representative Rushdi, first delivered a welcoming address to the Egyptian delegation.  Subsequent speakers included British Foreign Secretary Eden and the Chinese Ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, and several dozen others. Gu stated that China has always held Egypt's ancient culture in high esteem, and that Chinese people of the Islamic faith number 48 million, thus showing extreme sympathy and interest in the Egyptian people obtaining their rightful international status.  He added that Egypt's success in Geneva is no less than the satisfactory conclusion of the Montreux Conference, as it both demonstrates the increasing expansion of international justice and is due to the greatness of the Egyptian nation, not only due to its ancient culture but also because it possesses the spirit of youthful enterprise.  Gu further stated that the League of Nations has two missions: one is to promote cooperation between nations for the benefit of the public and for humanitarianism, and the other is to create world peace.  If these two objectives are to be achieved, it requires a common spirit of upholding the League of Nations covenant and concerted efforts from all countries.  From this perspective, each country joining the League of Nations as a new member brings us closer to the realization of the ideal of universal peace.  The head of the Egyptian delegation, Nahas, then expressed his gratitude, especially praising Britain's upholding of justice.  British Foreign Secretary Eden also extolled the importance of future cooperation between Britain and Egypt.  Egypt's joining the League of Nations proves that Egypt is now an independent nation, and he is deeply confident that it will begin beneficial cooperation with other countries of the League of Nations from now on.  Subsequently, the Indian Islamic leader and British Privy Councillor Aga Khan spoke, calling Egypt the connecting point between East and West, and that the Egyptian people and the eighty million Muslims in India share the same religion and are brothers in the eyes of the world. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 26th)

[Geneva] The Egyptian delegation consists of three members, with Prime Minister Nahas serving as the chief delegate. The other two are Foreign Minister Ghali and Finance Minister Ebeid. They immediately led a number of secretaries, all wearing Egyptian-style red felt hats, into the hall. After taking their seats, the President of the Assembly, Rushdi, delivered a welcoming address, stating that Egypt and Turkey are both Mediterranean countries with extremely close friendship. Given Egypt's geographical and economic position, it will undoubtedly play an important role within the League of Nations and will especially serve as an important factor in the balance of power in the Mediterranean. Thereupon, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas delivered a speech in French, stating that Egypt is determined to serve peace, and that Egypt signed the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty last year and the Montreux Convention this year, which is sufficient proof of its aspiration for international cooperation.

### The Issue of Withdrawing Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War

The Non-Intervention Committee's Proposal Circulated to Various Countries for Consent

[London] The Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held its twenty-first meeting today. A communiqué was issued afterwards stating, "The Committee has reviewed the implementation of the monitoring plan for Spain's sea and land borders and found it satisfactory. The Committee also discussed the plans for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers proposed by the experts of the subcommittee. It was decided to forward them to the governments of the countries concerned and ask them to inform the Committee as soon as possible whether they are prepared to implement the plan for the withdrawal of volunteers if the following two situations occur: ㊀ The Committee reaches a general agreement on the withdrawal plan; ㊁ Both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War accept the withdrawal plan." (Central News Agency, Havas, 26th)

[London] Well-informed sources here claim that there is optimism regarding the Spanish truce issue, due to the results of Foreign Secretary Eden's talks with representatives of various countries in Geneva. The Soviet Union's reply to the British proposal will be submitted within a few days, but Italy has not yet indicated a reply. It is said that both the Nationalist and Republican forces are dissatisfied with this proposal, but the Valencia government has also stated that "under certain conditions" it is willing to discuss the issue. (National Maritime Telegraph, 26th)

[Rome] Responsible figures recently announced that the Italian government has not yet made a final decision regarding the British government's proposal for a temporary truce between the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War in order to withdraw volunteers from various countries. The Italian government is closely monitoring the progress of the Nationalist forces in the Bilbao area of northern Spain. It is generally expected that the Nationalist forces will launch a new offensive against the port. (Central News Agency, Havas, 26th)

### Schacht Hopes for German-French Compromise

And Does Not Forget Colonies

[Paris] Dr. Schacht, the German Minister of Economic Affairs, presided over the opening ceremony of the German pavilion at the International Exposition today. One of the most important sections of his long speech stated, "Among the countries of the world, none can produce enough food in their mainland or colonies to supply their people, except for Switzerland, which enjoys international protection, and Germany. That Germany, a great nation, alone faces this unequal situation is of great significance and should be carefully considered by statesmen of all countries. In short, if we wish to maintain this unequal state of affairs and leave it unchanged for a long time, the various dangers in the world will be impossible to eliminate. Conversely, if we can find a way to change this situation, it will be of great benefit to the preservation of world peace." He also stated that this is Germany's first time participating in an international exposition since the European War, and this action is sufficient to prove to the world that Germany is determined to actively participate in construction projects and establish world trade on a solid and sound foundation. France was formerly one of Germany's greatest enemies, but now Germany is actually participating in an international exposition in the French capital, which is a good omen for the future and one that I deeply believe in. Schacht finally expressed his belief that the Paris Exposition will promote international relations and lead to a state of harmony. Regarding the talks on a French-German commercial treaty, he hoped to achieve satisfactory results so that trade between the two countries could return to the pre-war level.

### The Hungarian Military Equipment Issue

Foreign Ministers of the Little Entente and Hungary Each Express Their Attitudes

[Geneva] The representatives of the Little Entente countries held a meeting this morning during the temporary session of the League of Nations Assembly to discuss the issue of Hungary's rearmament. It was decided that unilateral abrogation of treaties should be opposed, and it was hoped that Hungary could rearm in a friendly manner. Personnel from the delegations of those countries recently announced that today's meeting also discussed the relations between the Soviet Union and Romania, and between Czechoslovakia and Austria. It was generally believed that the current situation is extremely suitable for the issue of economic cooperation among Central European countries. (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas)

Budapest, Hungary. Foreign Minister Kanya recently delivered a speech in the House of Representatives, stating that Hungary will now continue to pursue its peaceful objectives through peaceful means. Since the hegemony of the Little Entente countries in the Danube River basin has been weakening, opportunities for political rapprochement among the countries have been increasing. Hungary seeks nothing more than the recognition of Hungary's sovereignty and equal rights to armaments. Moreover, the respect for the sovereignty of all countries is based on the covenant of the League of Nations, and the principle of equal rights to armaments was decided at the Disarmament Conference in December 1932. In short, Hungary's approach to the Little Entente countries has only one condition: that the Little Entente countries respect the Italo-Austro-Hungarian Protocols in political and economic matters. (Central News Agency, 27th)

### Italian Ambassador Visits US Authorities

Approves Roosevelt Convening a Disarmament Conference

[Washington] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday made a statement to a correspondent of the Associated Press stationed in Rome, stating that if President Roosevelt agrees to initiate an international disarmament conference, Italy will support it. Italian Ambassador Suvich recently visited Wells, the Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, and informed him that "this statement is indeed in line with the wishes of Prime Minister Mussolini, and President Roosevelt's tendency to remain uninvolved in European affairs makes him the most suitable initiator of an international disarmament conference." Suvich also made a statement to the press afterwards, saying, "I thought that Mr. Wells would be pleased to hear whether my country's prime minister unconditionally approved of the statement published by the American news agency yesterday, so I decided to meet with him on my own initiative." (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas)

[Washington] Welles, the Acting Secretary of State, today expressed a deep interest in the informal statement of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini supporting the American President Roosevelt's convening of a world disarmament conference. Welles stated that since Mussolini's remarks to Simms, a diplomatic correspondent for the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, were informal in nature and had not been officially recognized, the US government must treat them as informal.

### Prelude to British Cabinet Reshuffle

MacDonald Has Resigned; Baldwin Will Leave Today

[London] Lord President of the Council MacDonald has resigned to the King today. It is expected that Prime Minister Baldwin will resign tomorrow. The Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain is the most promising candidate to succeed him. MacDonald looked pale when he entered the gates of Buckingham Palace by car. Those who saw him outside the palace gates hardly recognized him as a cabinet member. After entering the palace, he had an audience with the King in private. This was the last time that MacDonald had an audience as a cabinet member. MacDonald is seventy years old and has served as prime minister three times. MacDonald was the first member of the Labor Party to hold the position of prime minister. Although he is now leaving the cabinet, it is said that he will remain a member of the House of Commons. It is generally speculated that Baldwin will enter the palace tomorrow morning to resign and request the King to summon Chamberlain to form a cabinet. Newspapers have made many speculations about the organization of the new cabinet. It is generally believed that Runciman's speech in the House of Commons on Tuesday regarding British commercial policy was his last speech as President of the Board of Trade. It is likely that he will be transferred to the House of Lords and will no longer be a figure in the new cabinet. Further reports say that MacDonald entered the palace to see the King but did not hand over the seal of Lord President of the Council. It is said that the King intends to grant MacDonald an aristocratic title for his services to the country, but MacDonald politely declined the hereditary title, and the King has agreed to his request.

[London] The Baldwin Cabinet held its last weekly meeting at 4:00 PM today, after which the cabinet will resign and reorganize. Prime Minister Baldwin will retire, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will succeed him as Prime Minister. According to predictions from parliamentary sources, Chamberlain will likely present a list of new cabinet members to King George VI this Friday. After the King approves it, the new cabinet can be formed. As for the cabinet members, in addition to Chamberlain himself serving as Prime Minister, the current Home Secretary Sir John Simon will be transferred to Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the current First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Samuel Hoare will be transferred to Home Secretary. The current Secretary of State for War Cooper will be transferred to First Lord of the Admiralty, and the vacancy he leaves as Secretary of State for War will be filled by the current Minister of Transport Hore-Belisha. When Cooper was in office, he failed to meet expectations for recruiting new soldiers. Now, Hore-Belisha is an outstanding propagandist who will certainly make up for this deficiency. Furthermore, Lord President of the Council MacDonald will retire and be succeeded by the current Lord Privy Seal Lord Halifax. President of the Board of Trade Runciman will also leave the cabinet and may be replaced by the Secretary for Overseas Trade Colville. As for Foreign Secretary Eden, Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore, and Dominions Secretary Malcolm MacDonald (son of Lord President of the Council MacDonald), they will remain in their positions.

### The Issue of Philippine Independence

The US Is Carefully Studying Trade and Economic Relations

[Washington] Undersecretary of State Sayre today formally notified the House Committee on Territories for the first time that the Joint American-Philippine Committee will consider the impact of early Philippine independence on the economic relations between the Philippines and the United States. He stated that if the Philippines were to gain early independence, it would require formal approval from Congress. Chairman Tydings of the Senate Committee on Territories stated that the committee will also consider whether the preferential trade relations between the Philippines and the United States should be terminated before the Philippines gains early independence, and whether the adjustment of the Philippine economic plan should be accelerated or delayed. Sayre stated that when the joint committee studies the issue of independence, it has understood that the preferential trade relations between the Philippines and the United States must be terminated as soon as possible so that the Philippines can have the opportunity to adjust its economic situation. As for what Sayre notified Congress, the joint committee is considering the following: ㊀ What kind of preferential trade relations should the two countries have for a considerable period of time? ㊁ What kind of trade relations should the two countries have after the termination of the preferential relations? ㊂ What kind of adjustments should the Philippines make to its economic situation? ㊃ What kind of changes should the Philippines make to its currency and banking system? ㊄ How should the rights of American citizens be protected after independence? ㊅ How would the guarantee of neutrality by the countries concerned affect various issues if the Philippines were to obtain it?

### More Than 80,000 Workers Strike at the Three Major US Steel Plants

Direct Action Begins at 10 PM; Picketing Workers Confront Police; Labor Unrest Also Occurs at Ford Factories

Canton, Ohio. Labor unrest occurred in the US steel industry today. Union leaders have notified workers at the three major steel plants to take direct action. The Steel Workers Organizing Committee was ordered today to go on strike at midnight at the Republic Steel Corporation, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company, and Inland Steel Company. The three plants employ 89,500 workers. Beddow, the Great Lakes District Director of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, announced the strike in the Chicago area after negotiations with Pittsburg plant officials, because the plant refused to sign a contract. Beddow stated that after holding a general assembly, the striking workers will march to the picket lines, while Republic Steel's strike picketers will use sticks and bricks as weapons to intimidate the plant's police and force them to retreat into the plant. (National Telegram, 26th)

Canton, Ohio. Steel workers in the Chicago area held a fierce meeting today and decided to start the strike ahead of schedule at 10 PM tonight. Workers have already begun picketing at Youngstown and Inland plants to prevent night shift workers from entering the plant to work. Republic Steel also went on strike ahead of schedule and sent workers to picket. 400 police officers suppressed the situation and arrested 15 troublemaking workers. According to a picketing worker who told an Associated Press reporter, the union is demanding a six-hour workday and a basic wage of eight dollars per day. (National Telegram, 27th)

Chicago. The three companies have a total of 34 plants, and their business scope accounts for about one-third of the entire US steel industry. Because they refused to sign a contract recognizing the union's right to represent workers in collective bargaining, 23,000 workers left the plants yesterday on strike. The rest have now been ordered to temporarily suspend work. Republic Steel Corporation claims that there are many workers in the plant who can continue to produce. This morning, a large contingent of police broke through the picket line and arrested 20 strikers. This is the worst US steel strike in the past 19 years. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 27th)

Detroit. After 1,200 workers at the Ford Motor Company's branch plant in Richmond, California, went on strike yesterday, the Committee for Industrial Organization, led by Lewis, attempted to incite workers at the Ford branch plant here to hold a sympathy strike.

### Reuters General Manager States Progress in News Technology

The Function of Wireless Telegraphy Is Beyond What Maritime Telegraphy Can Do; It Can Transmit All Over the World in Minutes

[London] Sir Roderick Jones, General Manager of Reuters, stated at the Imperial Press Conference this morning the technological progress in transmitting news to the world. The knight described in detail the progress from carrier pigeons to facsimile telegraphy, which can transmit an entire column of news to other places as is in a matter of minutes, and a machine that can not only send telegrams but also type them out in letters. The development of wireless telegraphy and its various effects are, in his opinion, still unknown or not valued by all sectors of the British Empire today. However, this is an extremely important issue for the newspapers of the Dominions and the Empire. Soon, most of the world's news will be transmitted wirelessly, but this does not harm the interests of submarine cables. In fixed locations, submarine cables are still faster than wireless telegraphy, which is generally recognized. The main task of wireless telegraphy lies in communicating with mobile points and broadcasting and disseminating news with a larger capacity. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 26th)

### Japanese Military Attaché Conference in North China

Shibayama Kiyono Ordered to Convene Conference, Draft Proposals to be Taken Back to Country for Reference by the Three Northeastern Provinces

Tianjin Dispatch: Shibayama Kaneshiro, chief of the China Section of the Japanese Army Ministry, and Kiyono, chief of the Second Section, arrived in China on the 21st of this month under the order of Japanese Army Minister Sugiyama Gen. They first went to Shanghai to meet with Japanese embassy military attachés Kita and Honda, exchanging opinions on the current situation and conveying Sugiyama's intentions on diplomacy towards China. After secretly convening a military attaché conference in Shanghai, they took a China National Aviation Corporation plane to Qingdao on the 25th to meet with the Japanese army military attaché stationed in Qingdao, Taniodani Kahuo, and listened to a general report. That afternoon, they took a Huitong plane to Tianjin and visited Japanese army commander Tashiro at the Haiguang Temple Japanese army headquarters at around 2 p.m. for a lengthy secret discussion. That evening, Japanese military attachés stationed in Beiping Matsui, Imai, and Teradaira, military attaché stationed in Taiyuan Kono, military attaché stationed in Qingdao Taniodani, and military attaché stationed in Jinan Ishino all arrived in Tianjin one after another. At 8 a.m. on the 26th, Shibayama and Kiyono took the lead in convening the so-called North China military attaché conference at the Haiguang Temple Japanese army headquarters. In addition to the above-mentioned people who naturally attended, those from the Japanese army headquarters who participated in the meeting were commander Tashiro, chief of staff Hashimoto, and section chiefs Oki, Wachi, and Ikeda, staff officers Asai and Adachi, totaling more than ten people. First, Shibayama announced the instructions of the Japanese Army Ministry on diplomatic and economic issues with China. Next, Kiyono announced the Japanese army's policy on current diplomacy. Then, the military attachés stationed in Beiping, Taiyuan, Jinan, and Qingdao reported on general diplomacy and the current situation in North China. After that, they entered the discussion stage, similar to the situation of the Japanese consular conference in North China, dividing the issues into two parts: current and future, to study specific opinions. The meeting adjourned at noon and had lunch in the headquarters. At 2 p.m., the meeting continued and adjourned at 4 p.m. In the evening, Hashimoto hosted a banquet at the Shikishima Hotel for the participants. The meeting only lasted one day before closing. Shibayama and Kiyono are scheduled to go to Beiping on the 28th for investigation and return to their country at the end of the month. The mission of Shibayama and others to China is that the Japanese Army, Navy, and Finance Ministers will hold a meeting on China issues in early June to study specific plans for adjusting Sino-Japanese diplomacy, so that Kawagoe can take them back to his post and restart negotiations on pending Sino-Japanese issues. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already sent Morishima and Beppu to China to widely consult the opinions of overseas officials. The Army Ministry is also imitating the same method, specially sending Shibayama and Kiyono to first go through South China and then to North China. Shibayama was a participant in the Tanggu Truce and previously served as a military attaché at the embassy in Beiping. Within the Army Ministry, he is known as an expert on China. This time, being sent to China is probably to have him re-verify the Chinese situation to see if there are any new changes. It is heard that Shibayama advocated a new understanding of China to the military attachés before and after the meeting on the 26th, which was quite unpopular among the younger officers here. Because the younger officers here hold extremely tough views on China, they believe that no matter how turbulent domestic politics are, it can be ignored. The Japanese army headquarters in North China, in order to carry out its plan, will advance bravely based on what it has always believed. (26th)

The opening time was set at 8 a.m. Han Fuju went up the mountain from the station at 6:30 a.m. He first went to the Memorial Tower to pay his respects. A large pine arch was tied in front of the tower, with the words "National Funeral Ceremony for Martyrs of the Xinhai Luanzhou Revolution" written horizontally. On both sides hung an elegiac couplet personally written by Feng Yuxiang, which read " 紫塞風高、此日回思猛士、荀龍月冷、他年痛奠諸公、" Han and others paused in front of the tower and went to the Martyrs' Shrine meeting place. After a short pause, Feng also arrived in army dress. Representatives from all walks of life and guests arrived one after another.

After the speeches, photos were taken and 101 ceremonial cannons were fired to conclude the meeting. After the meeting, Feng specially prepared white flour pancakes and distributed them to the attendees. The pancakes were printed with the words "Create a Republic, Recover Lost Territory." Then, they gathered in front of the Memorial Tower and took a group photo. Feng also invited Han and others to Wangzhuang (Feng's residence) to rest and talk.

Capture of a Large Gang of Bandits

Since the occurrence of the robbery and assault case in Yanxiang Township outside the Guo City, the detectives have been stepping up their efforts. The two suspicious boats captured outside the South Gate a few days ago, with four male and female suspects, were indeed related to the case. It was further discovered that there was a large gang of bandits entrenched in the lake. The detectives set out again on the night of the sixteenth, in two directions, southwest. During the search in the lake, two more bandit ships were found, with six male and female bandits. A large number of gold and silver ornaments, clothes, and pawn tickets were also found in the boats. It is said that this group of bandits is from the Taihu Xianqianshan gang. The bandit leader Wang Jinshan was also captured this time and has been sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Regarding the Yanxiang case, he has confessed to the robbery without hesitation. Other matters are still under investigation.

Pile Driving at Zhongshan Wharf

The Provincial Capital Municipal Construction Office is building the Zhongshan Wharf, with a budgeted expenditure of over 200,000 yuan. The landfill project has been completed, and the casting of steel-reinforced concrete piles is now underway.

Death of a Famous Xiangqi Player

The famous Xiangqi player Wang Haoran, one of the most skilled players in our country, was working as an assistant at the Zhenjiang Fuyun Shipping Company. He suddenly contracted a minor illness a few days ago and returned to his residence in Mituo Lane, Yangzhou, for treatment. Unfortunately, due to his old age and weak health, he passed away on the 14th. The Xiangqi world has lost another master.

### Nantong

Entertainments for Raising Funds for Sichuan Disaster Relief

Various circles in Nantong have decided to hold entertainments at the Nantong 塲 on the last two days of the month to raise funds for Sichuan disaster relief. Military and police officials, male and female school students, and the 塲 Art Bureau have all joined the performance.

### Ningbo

Escorting Japanese People Out of the Country

The Japanese Yamagishi Takehide, accompanied by Lu Yuanchun, a Chinese employee of the Japanese-Chinese Travel Agency, went to Zhenhai for sightseeing. Because the Japanese was buying maps from a shop in the city and his actions were mysterious and his speech was evasive, he attracted the attention of the Public Security Bureau. Upon inspection of his passport, the tourist destinations included 寗波. The Bureau, in accordance with the 百华中内 tourist destinations, stated that he could pass through but not stay. He was prepared to send a letter to the police to escort him out of the country.

### Gleanings from Yunnan (16)

— A Cup Rolled Up

Yunnan has vast lands and a sparse population. The land is not barren, making it ideal for animal husbandry. Currently, two areas that produce horses are temporarily occupied by two powerful forces, leading to a scarcity of domestically produced horses. (Local breeds are not suitable for military use.) If we were to crossbreed the small horses of Yunnan and Guizhou with the tall, large horses of Arabia, creating a mixed Arab-Chinese breed, using Yunnan as an experimental breeding ground, the benefits would be substantial. Chairman Long mentioned to me that the province has already established a ranch in western Yunnan, but it still focuses on breeding local small horses because they are hardy, require simple feed, and are suitable for mountain terrain. It seems Long only considers horses for civilian use. On the 30th day (May 5th), in the morning, I went to "Gu Tong Park" in the southern suburbs. The park has secluded woods and rocks. There are two tombs of loyalists, a joint burial for Wu Yun and Wang Wei. Wu and Wang were Ming Dynasty martyrs, practically old comrades of the Ming revolution. (When Zhu Yuanzhang controlled the Jiangnan region, Liang Wang Kublai still occupied a corner of Yunnan and Guizhou. Wang and Wu arrived here during the Hongwu era, but were killed by Kublai's forces in the fifth and seventh years of Hongwu.) Then, I went to "Jinbi Park," which was full of entertainment, theaters, tea houses, small stalls, etc., similar to Tianqiao in Beiping. Next was "Cuihu Park," but most of the lake had been converted into fields, making it somewhat similar to Shichahai in Beiping. In Kunming, the only place worth seeing is "Yuantong Park." At nine o'clock, I visited the "Spinning Factory." The machinery was not outdated, but raw materials were scarce. Yunnan only produces enough cotton annually to supply the factory for one month, making it necessary to rely on foreign cotton. Some years ago, the provincial authorities purchased a large quantity of American cotton seeds and transported them to Haiphong. The French authorities made things difficult, demanding disinfection before crossing the border. But can cotton seeds still be planted after sterilization? So, they are still sitting in the Haiphong warehouse, only good for oil extraction in the future. Afterwards, I visited the "Shilongba Hydroelectric Power Plant." The plant is a limited company. All machinery and materials have been provided by Siemens of Germany. The German technicians have too much control, resulting in a million in debt. The original power is somewhat weak. The first water source of the Haikou River is fifteen meters, and the second water source downstream is also fifteen meters. The upstream machinery is aging, and three units have recently been purchased downstream, two of which are twenty-five years old, and one that arrived just three months ago. Due to the weak water power, the city is dimly lit. The current construction department plans to expand the plant or rebuild a new plant in a higher river, with a power of 20,000 horsepower (the current plant only has 7,000 horsepower).

At noon, we met with Chairman Long Zhizhou in separate groups to discuss various matters. I, along with Mr. Lin Shimo, Mr. Luo Lixue, and Mr. Tang Yiqing, formed a group. When we entered, Mr. Long was already waiting. Mr. Luo, representing the Ministry of Interior, was consulting with the Yunnan province on the implementation of land policies. He asked Mr. Long whether the land administration in the 81 counties of Yunnan was fully compliant with the various laws and regulations promulgated by the central government, hoping for a remedy. Mr. Long replied that the land administration in these 80-odd counties was still based on pre-ministerial regulations, so there were slight differences in implementation. These are gradually being corrected. The counties that have not yet implemented land administration will do so in accordance with the ministerial regulations from now on. A land administration bureau will be established, modeled after the precedents in other provinces and cities. He hoped that the Ministry would provide ample reference materials. Mr. Lin Shimo asked why Yunnan Province had not yet organized a geological survey, making it impossible to estimate all mineral resources, especially the fuel needed for future railway construction. Mr. Long replied that coal was exposed everywhere, but he did not know how much was there, but believed there should be enough. Mr. Tang Yiqing asked why the Kunming power plant was losing money when power plants everywhere else were making profits. Mr. Long replied that it was due to foreign debt and poor management. He was planning to build another large-scale hydroelectric plant and provide the surplus electricity for irrigation. Mr. Tang said that the Hunan power plants were technically unified, and even small places were managed by industrial students and made profits. Mr. Long replied that there was an American church between Kunming and Heilongtan that used hydropower to install dozens of lights, which was also very effective, showing that small-scale hydropower could also be promoted. There are already seven power plants in Yunnan, and more can be developed in the future. Mr. Lin Shimo said that the capital power plant only had 100,000 yuan in capital in 1928, but later issued 3 million in bonds, and now has 10 million yuan in assets, a net profit of 7 million yuan in nine years. He also said that the capital, Qi Yan, and Hangzhou power plants should establish a liaison system, so that the three plants could adjust the current flow as needed to save money. Mr. Long knew that I had been to Kunming at the end of the Qing Dynasty, so we talked briefly about the old days and mentioned the recent activities of Jin Yiqing, Gao Zibai, and Li Bodong. He also said that many Vietnamese came here every year to escape the summer heat, and Kunming planned to develop its scenic spots and build a large hotel, which would be especially convenient if operated by the China Travel Service. He said that with the gradual improvement of road and rail transportation, various construction plans were being prepared to welcome foreign investment or central government funding and technical personnel. Mr. Long had a very detailed mind, answering every question and always appropriately. This is commendable.

There is a copper smelter in Kunming, located on the site of the old copper coin bureau. It is very small in scale. Due to the recent sluggish sales of copper, the work is limited. The copper mines in Dongchuan are not fully mined.

The gentlemen of Kunming hold Ma Cong and Ma Fan in high regard. Mr. Ma Fan was killed by Xiao Ke and He Long's communist forces in April last year while serving as the county magistrate of Chuxiong. At the same time, seven other county magistrates were killed. Mr. Ma Cong is currently working in the provincial capital. Tang Jigeng's younger brother, Jiyu, is currently in charge of the Yunnan Central Military Branch School and is also well-respected in the area.

That evening, the provincial government held a farewell banquet and invited a Yunnan opera troupe of male and female performers. The five Yunnan operas were drawn from Han tune, Yi tune, Wei tune, and Ping tune, without a dedicated style. To put it nicely, they are a blend of Ping, Han, Hui, and Yi. To put it bluntly, they are a hodgepodge.

On the 32nd day (September 6th), in the morning, I strolled to "Bishi Slope" at the North Gate, where Emperor Yongli of the Ming Dynasty committed suicide. A tall monument stood to the left of the road, and passersby respectfully paid their respects. Behind it was a waterworks, producing only about ten tons of water per day, not enough to supply the city's 130,000+ residents. Therefore, most people still drink well water. Then, I visited the Yunnan Daily Public Association. I learned that the "Yunnan Daily" was run by the provincial government, headed by Director Gong Zizhi. It sold 6,000-7,000 copies daily, with a fixed monthly budget of over 4,000 yuan in national currency. Advertising and newspaper sales revenue were used for expansion. The "Republic Daily" was run by the provincial party headquarters and was also doing well. There were also several privately-run newspapers, but Kunming newspapers cost ten yuan in national currency (Guiyang costs sixteen yuan), which was quite difficult to bear.

Today, eight people are departing via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Liangshan, then to Guilin. The general manager of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Mr. Badu Er, arranged a "Michelin" special train to send them to Haiphong and then into Vietnam. Two others are taking the northern route, flying to Chengdu to avoid the hardship of traversing the Guizhou mountains. The rest are assigned to various vehicles, departing at noon on the 7th, spending the night in Qujing, the 8th in Panxian, the 9th in An'nan, the 10th in Anshun, the 11th in Guiyang, and the second day taking the route to Guilin. After Guilin, they will go to Hengyang, some going down the Yangtze River to Wuhan, and some taking the Yuehan Railway south to Guangzhou, then to Hong Kong, following the coast north.

At noon, Mr. Qian Jie held a banquet for friends at his father-in-law Mr. Zhang Chun'ou's villa, named "Luocui Mountain Villa." The flowers, trees, mountains, and rocks were extremely beautiful. Regiment Commander Chu left early to inspect the Kunming Boy Scouts. The rest of us went shopping, bathed, and packed our belongings. Chairman Long and many acquaintances of the members of the group in Kunming presented local products as gifts. Everyone felt that it would be disrespectful to refuse, but the luggage would be cumbersome. Mr. Zhang Chengzhi of the newspaper branch could not escape the custom, gifting two small boxes of Yunnan ham and two bags of tea. He only accepted one box of ham and returned the rest.

Commander Pei went to visit a commercially-run vegetable oil mill today and brought back a bottle of pine nut oil to be analyzed in Beijing. Because Yunnan produces a lot of pine nuts, it is said that pine nut oil has a stronger nourishing effect than cod liver oil. Mr. Pei will study the results and publish them to the world.

The members of the group have a great fondness for calligraphy and rubbings, so new and old rubbings of "Cuan Baozi," "Cuan Longyan," "Xiangguang Temple," and "Meng Xiaoju," etc., were searched and emptied. The bookstore consignment department sold several copies of "Yunnan Binds" and "Yunnan Series." In addition, people purchased spotted copper, Yunshi, jade bracelets, etc., with a total market income of 100,000 Yunnan currency (equivalent to 10,000 yuan in national currency).

The meteorological observation work in Kunming has not been undertaken by the government. A person of determination, Chen Yide, has been studying astronomy for a long time. He has set up a "De Meteorological Observatory" on Qianju Street. His wife, younger brother, and son take turns recording, a fascinating job for more than ten years. The family is poor, and even the son's schooling is in jeopardy. Two years ago, the Beijige Central Meteorological Observatory, in recognition of his dedication, gave him several instruments. Now, he sends monthly and annual reports to Beijing. Mr. Chen's family has maintained a continuous record of the longest weather observations in the entire territory, establishing the foundation for Yunnan's meteorology. Although the government has not provided assistance, society should commend him. Here, the reporter solemnly introduces him to the readers as the epilogue to the Jingdian Highway. Goodbye, Kunming.

### The Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries Not to Buy or Sell Smuggled Goods

Last Year's Net Worth Was 900 Million Yuan. All Industries Should Rely on Their Conscience and Refuse to Sell.

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified all industry associations, stating that the smuggling trend has recently spread to Shanghai, and cases of customs officers being injured while combating smuggling have also occurred frequently. Under this smuggling situation, the amount of tax revenue lost by our country is based on the net import value of 900 million yuan for the whole year of last year, while smuggled goods imported have reached more than 200 million yuan, accounting for a quarter of the total, which is alarming. Recently, smuggling has become more rampant, and national tax revenue has been reduced day by day, which has caused great damage to our national finances and national economy. If this continues, we will face the last day of being powerless. If we want to save this crisis, on the one hand, we rely on the anti-smuggling personnel to uphold the enthusiasm for cherishing sovereignty and the courage to be fearless of the powerful and violent, and to fulfill their duties. On the other hand, the people of the whole country, at this time of crisis, must rely on their conscience and unanimously refuse to transport, sell, purchase, and use smuggled goods in order to preserve the roots of the national economic lifeline. Therefore, it was resolved by the Standing Committee meeting of the 14th Anti-Smuggling Committee of this Chamber to notify all industries to pay attention to smuggling, rely on their conscience, and swear not to buy or sell smuggled goods. Correspondingly, this letter is issued to inform you, and it is hoped that your association will check and notify the same industry, and abide by it.

### The Leprosy Relief Society Solicited at the Opening Yesterday

The 12th Solicitation Congress of the China Leprosy Relief Society opened at 4:30 yesterday afternoon in Hardoon Garden. Deputy Mayor Yu hosted leaders from all walks of life in the city. Among those present were Deputy Mayor Yu, Lu Bohong, Wang Xiaolai, Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Boqi, Zhu Shaoping, Zhao Jinqing, Xu Peihuang, Pan Gongzhan (represented by Zhang Binghui), Li Ting'an, Jiang Jianbai, Wang Shaoqi, Liu Ruiheng, Lu Ganchen, He Dekui, Qu Wenliu, and more than a hundred others. During the meeting, Deputy Mayor Yu reported on the significance of the solicitation congress, and Zhu Shaoping reported on the methods of the solicitation congress. Lu Bohong delivered a thank you speech. The details are as follows:

Chairman's Speech

First, General Captain Deputy Mayor Yu gave a speech, saying that today is the opening day of the 12th Solicitation Congress of the China Leprosy Relief Society. He was very grateful for the presence of leaders from all walks of life. The Leprosy Relief Society has worked hard to carry out leprosy relief work and has achieved considerable results. The most painful thing in life is illness, and among illnesses, leprosy is the most painful. Those who suffer from this disease not only suffer a lot of pain themselves, but their relatives and friends are often unwilling to care for and take care of them because it is easy to spread. This shows the aversion of the general public to those who suffer from leprosy. There are no less than one million people in our country who suffer from this disease. If there is no relief method, we will not only sit idly by and watch our compatriots suffering from this disease, but it will also affect the health of the entire nation. The main purpose of this congress is to raise donations, but the greatest purpose is not only this. Generally speaking, it can be divided into three types: ㊀ Arouse the sympathy of the Chinese people for those suffering from leprosy; ㊁ Arouse the awareness of the people of the whole country that leprosy has a great impact on the future of the nation; ㊂ Enable people from all over the country to understand that there are now curable methods for those suffering from leprosy. You are all highly respected in society, and you can correct past erroneous concepts and enable you to directly and indirectly engage in leprosy relief work. Today, we have prepared refreshments and are very grateful for your presence.

Solicitation Purpose

Next, Honorary Chief of Staff Zhu Shaoping reported that the purpose of this solicitation congress is: ㊀ To recruit one thousand ordinary members, each paying ten yuan; to recruit one thousand permanent members, each paying one hundred yuan. The solicitation time is from the 27th of this month to the 30th of June. If you need to contact us for solicitation, you can go to the society's office on Chi Bang Road.

Lu's Thank You

Finally, Lu Bohong, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Society, delivered a thank you speech, saying that today the Society held the opening ceremony of the 12th Solicitation Congress, and he was very honored to have everyone enthusiastically participate, and he was very grateful to Deputy Mayor Yu for hosting the refreshments. He also thanked former Mayor Wu for his enthusiastic assistance in managing the Solicitation Congress and serving as the General Captain. Today, former Mayor Wu has been appointed Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and he is very grateful to Deputy Mayor Yu for enthusiastically agreeing to serve as the General Captain. The purpose of the solicitation is to raise 100,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan for ordinary membership fees. Now, under the leadership of General Captain Yu, and with the enthusiastic solicitation of the captains, the goal should not be difficult to achieve. As the chairman of the society, I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the society. I also thank Mrs. Hardoon for lending this place to hold the tea party, and I also express my gratitude on behalf of the society. The meeting adjourned at 6:00.

### Representatives of the Silk Industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Jointly Petitioned in the Capital Last Night

Requesting that the Import Tax on Rayon Be Changed to Ad Valorem Tax and Rejecting Japanese Tax Reduction Demands to Maintain National Interests

The Joint Association of Silk Weavers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang stated that the tax rate difference between imported rayon and woven products is more than double, resulting in a severe imbalance. This has led to a continuous influx of foreign silk into China, significantly impacting the sales of domestic silk. To address this situation, the association convened an emergency meeting of industry representatives from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shengze, Suzhou, Danyang, Wujiang, and other regions. They decided to organize a petition delegation to the government. It is reported that more than ten representatives from various regions, including Tu Jiean, Zhang Boying, Zhu Shaohen, Zhao Fuzhong, Wang Zhiwen, Wang Yangzhen, She Wenqing, Deng Gengxin, and Jiang Jingtao, took the night express train to the capital from Shanghai at 11 PM last night. They will go to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry to petition, urging them to revise customs tax rates and reject Japanese tax reduction demands to maintain national interests. The association's petition to various Yuan and Ministries is recorded as follows: A joint petition is presented, requesting approval and implementation. The association, considering the current tax system in our country, imposes a heavier tax on imported rayon raw materials than on imported rayon fabrics of the same quantity, reaching more than double. As a result, neighboring countries, known for their commercial warfare, are taking advantage of this inverted tax structure by importing large quantities of rayon fabrics into China and dumping them at low prices, flooding the country. Comparing the costs of domestic and foreign silk fabrics, domestic silk has a heavier tax burden and higher costs, leading to failure. The market price of silk fabrics is extremely chaotic, and the domestic silk business is declining sharply, making it impossible to maintain industrial and commercial livelihoods, leading to a potential total collapse. To save the crisis, it is necessary to start by adjusting customs duties, promptly increasing the import tax on rayon fabrics and reducing the import tax on rayon raw materials. This will prevent the cost of domestic silk from being higher than that of foreign silk. In short, if the import tax on foreign silk fabrics is levied ad valorem, the import tax on rayon raw materials should also be changed to ad valorem tax to fundamentally stop this loophole and allow domestic silk industry and commerce to survive. The association recently received letters from various industry associations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces requesting prompt remedies. Therefore, on the 24th day of this month (October 18th), representatives from silk industry associations in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shengze, Shanghai, Danyang, Shaoxing, and other regions were convened for a temporary meeting. After careful discussion by all the representatives present, it was unanimously agreed that neighboring countries exempt taxes on imported raw materials and impose heavy taxes on imported finished products to protect their domestic goods. This is a good and beautiful law, and commercial warfare relies on it to win. Now, our country's import tax on rayon is the opposite of that of neighboring countries. Raw materials are heavily taxed while finished products are lightly taxed. Raw materials are used for manufacturing domestic silk, and the heavier the tax on raw materials, the higher the price of domestic silk. The lighter the tax on imported finished products, the cheaper the price of foreign silk. Now, because the import tax on finished products and raw materials is inverted, domestic silk cannot compete with foreign silk and suffers failure. This is the case in foreign markets, and it will inevitably be the case in domestic markets. Looking at the sales of domestic silk abroad, which used to have a market advantage, it has now been almost completely seized by cheap silk. If this continues, it will be difficult to gain a foothold even in the domestic market. Our country's silk is rejected by heavy import taxes from other countries and squeezed by heavy taxes on imported raw materials in our own country. How can it stand? If we do not quickly petition to adjust the tax rates, we will inevitably be defeated by foreign silk. It was unanimously decided to form a petition delegation to go to the capital to earnestly petition the competent authorities for the following two proposals: (1) Request the government to revise the current tax rates, change the customs duties on imported rayon to ad valorem, and ensure that it is lower than the tax rate on imported woven products to prevent foreign silk from taking advantage and dumping. (2) The Japanese Three Ministers' Conference decided to use equality and reciprocity as the principle for negotiations with China, but intends to demand that our country reduce import taxes on Japanese goods. The government should pay serious attention to the details. If they make this proposal, our government should resolutely reject all finished products except for raw materials and not be tempted to avoid repeating the previous mistake of suffering greatly in the Sino-Japanese tariffs due to three years of mutual benefit. Now that the three-year period has long expired, our government should not allow them to continue, etc. The meeting minutes are on file. This matter concerns the vital interests of the domestic silk industry and commerce, and the national economy and people's livelihood are of great importance. The only way is to petition as a group and submit a joint report. We humbly request the Yuan and Ministries to investigate, verify, approve, and implement it to alleviate the crisis and maintain business. We are overwhelmed with anxiety as we await your orders and pray for your instructions to be followed. This would be a great favor.

### Li Bai Sends Huang Jibei as Representative to the Capital to Discuss Reorganizing Guizhou Province's Finances

Li Bai prepares a concrete written opinion and hands it over to Huang to take to the capital. Huang discusses that reorganizing finances requires setting the exchange rate for Guizhou currency. Requesting the central government to issue public bonds to repay provincial debts.

Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, the commander-in-chief of the Fifth Route Army, have specially sent Huang Jibei, the president of the Bank of Guangxi, to come to the capital via Shanghai as a representative to discuss everything related to reorganizing Guizhou Province's finances and asking the central government to determine the exchange rate of Guizhou currency. Huang, entrusted with this mission, took the Dollar Company's President Grant ship from Hong Kong on the 24th and arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 AM yesterday. The reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency, recognizing the importance of Huang's mission, visited him on the President Grant to learn about the situation, as follows:

Determining the Exchange Rate of Guizhou Currency

According to Huang, he is coming to Shanghai and then going to the capital to meet with central authorities to request the determination of the exchange rate of Guizhou currency so that Guangxi's finances can be stabilized. Currently, Guangxi mostly uses silver dollars, and although the province intends to set the exchange rate with the legal tender at 6% extra, it has not been determined due to various factual and environmental reasons. Therefore, it greatly affects the lives of the people of Guangxi. If you want to reorganize and stabilize Guangxi's finances, you must urgently stipulate the exchange rate between Guizhou currency and legal tender. Therefore, it is hoped that the problem of miscellaneous currencies in Guizhou Province can be resolved with a minimum exchange rate of 1.6. After arriving in the capital, he will personally meet with the authorities and ask them to consider and confirm it. The outside rumors that the exchange rate between Guizhou currency and legal tender will be doubled are completely untrue. As for a small number of merchants in Guangdong Province who take advantage of the environment to manipulate the price of Guizhou currency and try to suppress it, there will be no problem in the future after the central government determines the exchange rate. A considerable amount of Guizhou currency is currently flowing into Guangdong Province.

Reorganizing Guizhou Province's Finances

The Guizhou provincial authorities need to request instructions and assistance from the central government to resolve the reorganization of finances. They have formulated detailed methods and handed them over to Huang to take to the capital and submit to the central government. The central government had already drafted concrete measures regarding the reorganization of Guizhou's finances. The first step is to clear provincial debts and recover Guizhou currency. Guizhou Province was originally poor, and it has been working hard for years on various construction projects such as highways and water conservancy. The expenses required for these projects, which were borrowed from the Bank of Guangxi, amount to approximately 20 million yuan. In addition, because the provincial treasury is short of funds and the budget cannot be balanced, Li Bai decided to request the central government to issue public bonds to clear provincial debts and recover some Guizhou currency. Huang is entrusted with this mission. The reporter further inquired about the reorganization of the Bank of Guizhou into a branch of the Central Bank. The establishment of a Guangxi branch of the Central Bank is greatly related to the reorganization of finances. According to Huang, the first step now is to request the implementation of public bonds to reorganize debts. Reorganizing the provincial bank is still too early.

Departing for the Capital Today

Finally, when asked about the recent situation in Guangxi, he said that everything is now being carried out in accordance with the instructions of the central government. Guizhou is originally poor, but it can work hard. Guizhou Province is rich in minerals such as tin mines, most of which have already been developed. If the financial problem, such as the exchange rate issue, is resolved, it can also be activated accordingly. Regarding Commander-in-Chief Li and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai, they are currently engaged in reorganizing military affairs and have no time to come north for the time being. After Huang arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he immediately visited Gan Jiehou and others, the representatives of Li Bai who are currently staying in Shanghai, to meet and talk. He will not stay in Shanghai for long and will take the train to the capital today to personally meet with the central authorities, forward Li Bai's written opinions on reorganizing finances, and report on everything.

### The Home Improvement and Industrial Exhibition Opens This Morning

The Second Improved Home and China Industry Exhibition, which has been in preparation for several months, was opened to the press yesterday and is scheduled to open today (the 28th). The opening ceremony will be held at 11 AM this morning, and Acting Mayor Yu has been specially invited to cut the ribbon. People from all walks of life have also been invited to attend the ceremony. More than 190 Chinese and foreign manufacturers have participated in the exhibition and have completed their arrangements. A special reception was held for the Chinese and foreign press yesterday. The details are as follows:

Exhibition Hall Arrangement

The Improved Home Exhibition has already been held once before. Because it was organized by the Millington Company, most of the participants were foreign merchants, but all the visitors were Chinese. This is the second time it is being held, and Dr. Qian Chengxu, a member of the China General Federation of Industry, specially requested cooperation for the sake of promoting domestic goods and solicited participation from Chinese manufacturers. The result was very good. The venue is in the grandstand of the racecourse, which is very large, so there are as many as 150 exhibits. The content and order are better than the previous session. The main entrance of the venue is at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road, with a large archway hanging Chinese and British flags. Inside the entrance is the ticket office, which also sells catalogs. There are various competitions and coupons in it. Yesterday, reporters from various newspapers entered the venue with their press cards, and Director Qian Dan personally hosted them. After visiting the venue for a week, it was found that 54 Chinese merchants participated, such as the Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, Dahua Iron Factory, China Wool Textile Factory, Yuanfeng Company China Oil Lamp Company, Guanshengyuan, Commercial Press, and Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory. The layout is novel and the products are excellent. After that, they were led to the second floor for tea and snacks. All the wines and snacks were donated by the Ankan Foreign Company. At the same time, the Lun Chang Foreign Company and the Lever Brothers Soap Factory co-organized a fashion show until late at night before dispersing.

Qian's Speech

Dr. Qian Chengxu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Conference, expressed his personal aspirations and the process of cooperating with Millington. Qian said, "In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, I was sent to Europe to visit the Leipzig Exhibition in Germany, the Carnival in Belgium, and the Industrial Exhibition organized by the Federation of British Industries. The impressions I gained were combined with the impressions I gained from participating in many domestic exhibitions over the years. I deeply know that the organization of exhibitions has a certain way and system. There are many types and different natures, and the training of talents is based on the design and form of things. It is not possible to establish a foundation without a considerable opportunity to cooperate with foreigners first as a transition to cultivate specialized exhibition talents. The use of materials is also appropriate. In October last year, Mr. Millington sought my opinion on the joint organization of the China Industrial Exhibition by China and foreign countries and consulted more than ten times. Not many Chinese were interested in this, but Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Lin Kanghou, Guo Bingwen, and Jiang Baili expressed sympathy, but it was not possible to resolve how to promote it for a while. Finally, Mr. Millington persevered, renting the racecourse in the city center as the venue and working abroad at the same time. At this time, I felt that the cooperation should not be abandoned, and I felt that China's international trade could gain a position at home and abroad, so I joined hands with him, and all the rights I obtained were given to the Chinese participating manufacturers. According to the understanding between the two parties at the time, Chinese and foreign goods were displayed equally so that Chinese and foreign people could compare and observe them, and fully show the progress and improvement of China's industry abroad. However, the entire plan was hit again later, and several excellent Chinese products failed to participate as scheduled, which is very regrettable. Now, Chinese manufacturers have understood my proposal, so the participants are enthusiastic, which is probably because they have a good understanding of this conference. All the publicity from the media is enough to show your enthusiastic support for this conference, etc."

### The Shengping Ship Has Been Rescued Yesterday

Losses Exceed 100,000 Yuan. The Haiyuan Can Be Towed Out This Morning

The Shengping ship of the Minxin Shipping Company in this port ran aground off the coast of Taipei. The Yidufeng tugboat was sent from Shanghai to rescue it. First, the holes were patched, and then the water was pumped out. After more than 20 days and multiple towing attempts, the shipowner in this port finally received a telegram yesterday afternoon stating that the Shengping ship had been towed away from the reef on the night of the 26th. At 2 AM on the morning of the 27th, the ship was taken to Keelung by the Yidufeng tugboat. After a slight repair in Keelung, it will sail to Shanghai and enter the dock for inspection and major repairs. This time, the Shengping ship's accident cost more than 100,000 yuan in rescue and repair costs.

The China Merchants Bureau's Haiyuan ship continued to send telegrams to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The water pumping work has not been completed, and the ship will not be towed out of the reef until this morning to go to Hong Kong for repairs.

### Relief for the Sichuan Disaster

Collecting Donations

The Xinsheng News Agency said that the city's Sichuan Disaster Relief Association has been actively carrying out relief work in recent days and has sent out donation books to appeal to philanthropists from all walks of life to jointly provide relief. To facilitate donations and the payment of donations by fundraisers, the following banks, money shops, and newspapers have been entrusted to collect donations: Central Bank Head Office and Branches, Bank of China Head Office and Branches, Bank of Communications Head Office and Branches, Salt Bank Head Office and Branches, Shanghai Bank Head Office and Branches, China-South Bank Head Office and Branches, Continental Bank Head Office and Branches, Guohua Bank Head Office and Branches, Hengli Bank Head Office and Branches, Juxingcheng Bank Head Office and Branches, Chuankang Bank Head Office and Branches, Chuan Salt Bank Head Office and Branches, Sichuan Commercial Bank Head Office and Branches, Sichuan Meifeng Bank Head Office and Branches, Sichuan Provincial Bank Head Office and Branches, China Exchange Bank Head Office and Branches, Shanghai Shen Bao, Shanghai News, Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, Shanghai Renji Shantang, Shanghai Fuyuan Money Shop, Shanghai Hengxun Money Shop, Shanghai Tongshun Money Shop, and the association's office.

Preparing for Work Relief

The Huayang Yizhen General Association Sichuan Branch asked Mr. Baker to inspect Sichuan, and then discussed with Sichuan Province Chairman Liu Xiang to use the disaster victims to carry out work relief and complete the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The cost was set at 400,000 yuan. The Yizhen Association will bear all the expenses for recruiting disaster victims, as well as the disaster victims' food, accommodation, travel expenses, and medical expenses. Chairman Liu also agreed to allocate 150,000 yuan. Mr. Baker immediately returned to Shanghai and appealed in Shanghai. He and Zhang Jichun, the director of the engineering department of the association, left for Xuzhou, Xi'an, Binji, Chengdu, Guiyang, and other places on the 25th to handle all relief preparations and guide the work of the various branches.

### Soong Tzu-wen Currently Has No Intention to Visit Sichuan

The Central News Agency reported that it has been rumored in Beijing and Shanghai that Soong Tzu-wen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, will visit Sichuan in the near future. When the reporter inquired about this with people around Soong, they said that Soong has long intended to visit Sichuan to inspect Sichuan's construction, but he has been unable to do so because of the heavy workload of the Economic Council and financial affairs in Shanghai. Therefore, it will be difficult to make the trip in the near future, as Soong currently has no plans to visit Sichuan.

### Liu Duoquan Has Been Discharged from the Hospital

Moved to the Yang Residence to Continue Resting. The Injury Has Not Healed, So He Will Not Return to His Post for the Time Being

Liu Duoquan, the commander of the 49th Army, came to Shanghai this time to be treated for his injuries at the Orthopedic Hospital, and he has made good progress. The wound from the gunshot wound he suffered has almost healed, but his right arm injury still requires four weeks of treatment before it can heal completely. Liu suffered a major shock to his nerves during the assassination attempt, and he is currently restless in the hospital, so he was discharged from the hospital the night before last and moved to the private residence of Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, to rest and continue medical treatment. He will not return to his post for the time being.

### Commander Yang Paid a Return Visit to the Italian Envoy Yesterday Morning

Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, paid a return visit to the Italian Ambassador to China, Ke Mai, at the Italian Consulate on Jingan Temple Road at 10 AM yesterday morning, accompanied by Zhao Weixian, the director of the adjutant's office, and Sun Lupi, the secretary, because Ke had visited the headquarters the morning before. Ke and Consul General Nilong met him and entertained him with champagne, tea, and snacks. They had a pleasant conversation and left after about 20 minutes.

### New Words from Danish Scientist Professor Bohr

Exploring Atomic Science Has Made Great Progress. Physics and Chemistry Have Been Unified

The Zilin News reported that Danish scientist Professor Bohr, a Nobel Prize winner in physics, a member of the Norwegian-Finnish Academy of Sciences, and a member of the Uppsala and Gottingen Scientific Societies, recently traveled to the Far East and gave lectures along the way. He is currently in the capital. When he was in Japan, the Emperor awarded him a high-level medal to commend his scientific achievements. The professor met with a reporter from the Zilin News when he was stationed in Shanghai on Wednesday. The professor said, "What I am most surprised and pleased about on this trip to the Far East is that both China and Japan are cooperating in every possible way to engage in scientific exploration. Science is one of the best travelers in the world. There is no better way to promote international friendship than to explore things that are related to all of us, that is, science, and to work together to promote human communism." Although the professor is world-famous, he speaks with humility. The professor added that he does not often see guests, because science is not a novelty, and its work is often hindered by frightening rumors. The interviewer asked about the Copenhagen Institute of Theoretical Physics, which the professor presides over, and asked if he could tell us a little about it. The professor replied that the institute has more than 20 researchers engaged in increasing scientific knowledge. He did not want to exaggerate their work, but he heard that the institute is currently concentrating on exploring atomic theory, and there is a special realm of science from time to time that makes the minds of all the researchers focus on this. They all have a sharp determination to use their full strength to explore this special realm, and then they can take a step forward and continue to use all their strength to explore this new realm that has been reached. Exploring the nature of atoms now occupies the most prominent position. Since the beginning of this century, we have made great progress in atomic knowledge. Physics and chemistry are the two major categories of science, and scholars have always regarded them as different. The effect of atomic exploration has unified the two. The professor continued to describe the complex machines used in the right laboratory to measure atoms and the situation of testing under various conditions. Among them, the high-powered device for "bombarding" atoms, the rapidly rotating turntable, and the splitting of atoms have greatly aroused the curiosity of the general public. Today, it is possible to separate and examine each component of the atom one by one. The exploration of atoms is now related to the exploration of biology and is gradually exposing many magical biological properties. The exploration of atoms is quite like a fairy tale, but once the law of motion of extremely small molecules of matter is discovered, it will be ordinary. The professor also said that exploring atoms will be impossible without the close cooperation of scientists from various countries. Today, Cambridge University is one of the main centers of scientific exploration. France and Germany, especially the United States, are currently making great progress. Whenever a scientist in one country has an important invention, they will notify scientists in other countries. The results obtained by scientists are for the benefit of all, so the invention of one person benefits everyone. Scientists from all countries can rely on it to increase their knowledge. There is no nationalism or political prejudice in science. Everyone is of one mind, seeking to achieve a common goal. Both China and Japan are extremely concerned about scientific work and have the desire to assist with all their strength, so they will soon be able to cooperate with scientists from other countries in an effective manner. The professor concluded by saying that his visit to various countries this time aims to meet with scientists from various countries and consolidate their cooperation with Danish scientists.

Since the Shantou Incident, the Japanese garrison in Shanghai has suddenly become active. Recently, Japanese railway patrol cars have been frequently patrolling the city. The Japanese military patrol team in the North Sichuan Road area has also resumed patrols from time to time. In the west of Shanghai, Japanese troops urgently laid military telephone lines late the night before last, starting from the Toyota Yarn Factory, passing through the Da Kung No. 3 Factory, and connecting with the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters. At about 9 AM yesterday morning, more than 20 Japanese regular troops, divided into eight military trucks, went to the western district of Shanghai and surveyed the terrain from Zhongshan Road to Xiaoshadu Road. It was also discovered that Japanese troops were surveying the terrain on Yuyuan Road.

### Shen Liren Discusses Foreign Residents Paying Income Tax

Foreign Residents Enjoy Protection Rights, Naturally Should Fulfill Tax Obligations

Recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries to negotiate the matter of foreigners paying income tax. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency made a special visit to Mr. Shen Liren, a certified public accountant at the Chinese Accountants' Office, to solicit his opinion on this issue. Mr. Shen provided a detailed response, which is transcribed below. Mr. Shen stated that since the implementation of income tax, Chinese merchants have diligently complied with it. Looking at the reports from the Income Tax Office, the results are already evident. The patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people is truly admirable. As for foreigners residing in China, enjoying the rights of our country's protection, they should naturally fulfill the obligation to pay taxes. Therefore, the tax regulations also stipulate that foreign residents must pay taxes in the same way. Examining the income tax regulations of various countries, they all have similar provisions. The payment of income tax is limited to those operating within the territory of that country, regardless of their nationality. As for extraterritoriality, it is fundamentally unrelated to taxation. However, in the future, if legal issues arise due to refusal to pay taxes or other incidents, those enjoying extraterritoriality are not subject to Chinese legal sanctions and must be prosecuted in their respective consulates. This does not mean that citizens of countries with extraterritoriality can refuse to pay income tax. China has opened its customs ports for a long time, and there are no cases of refusal to pay due to extraterritoriality. However, taxation values consistency and fairness. Otherwise, if people from country A have to pay taxes while people from country B do not, the different burdens will clearly affect commercial competition. Although income tax is a direct tax, the result inevitably leads to it being passed on to consumers. Therefore, whether or not taxes are paid still affects prices. In this era of economic warfare, there should be no slight discrepancies. Recalling the previous years when the United States cancelled income tax for foreign residents, because British businesses operating in China were exempt from paying income tax in their own country, we can expect the same thing to happen here. I have often discussed this matter with British and American residents, and they believe that paying taxes is not a problem, but it must be consistent for everyone. Therefore, income tax is not an issue between international governments, but between our country and foreign merchants. However, due to the deliberate obstruction of a certain country, it is not known when this problem can be resolved. It is hoped that our Chinese people will not hesitate because of foreigners. Let us work together, enthusiastically contribute, so that while the burden on the people is slightly increased, the country will gain substantial revenue to cope with the difficulties of this extraordinary period. As the economy of the people and the country becomes closer, the people's interest in politics will become more intense. This can promote the advancement of democracy, and the prosperity of the country relies on it.

### Hu Wenhu Again Donates for Disaster Relief

Previously Donated 10,000 Yuan for Sichuan Relief, Now Donates 20,000 Yuan for Henan and Guizhou

Overseas Chinese pharmaceutical magnate Hu Wenhu has always been concerned about domestic affairs, especially donating to public welfare causes. He spares no effort, and his philanthropy has long been widely praised. During the Sichuan drought, as soon as Mr. Hu arrived in Hong Kong, he generously donated 10,000 yuan for disaster relief, which has been disclosed in various newspapers. It is now confirmed that Mr. Hu recently sent a letter to the Shanghai branch of his Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, generously donating 10,000 yuan each for disaster relief in Henan and Guizhou provinces. The donation has already been telegraphed directly from Hong Kong to the central government, which will be forwarded to the Disaster Relief Committee for distribution in the two provinces.

### Shoe Shiners' Enthusiastic Disaster Relief Contributions Praiseworthy

The China Foreign Joint Famine Relief General Association, located at 505 Henan Road in this city, has been using the proceeds from the continued fundraising for the 15th anniversary commemoration for emergency relief in the five provinces of Sichuan, Henan, Guizhou, Gansu, and Shaanxi. People from all walks of life have been very supportive. The Mushitang Relief Unemployed Group and the Service and Cultivation Discussion Group of the YMCA Religious Education Society in this city have also participated in voluntary fundraising. Most of the unemployed group earn a meager living, barely enough to feed themselves. However, two shoe shiners, Mr. Qi Wei Bi and Mr. Shen Jiajun, in addition to contributing from their savings, have also solicited donations from friends. Mr. Qi collected 11.20 yuan, and Mr. Shen collected 4.20 yuan, all of which were sent to the Relief Association for disaster relief. The students of the discussion group, most of whom are small shop clerks and trainees with very low incomes, also contributed 32.20 yuan. Their enthusiasm in supporting good deeds and helping disaster victims is truly admirable. Currently, Mr. Qi and Mr. Shen are continuing to solicit donations, and future results are sure to be promising.

### Team Leader Bai Zhongqi Sues Liang Yu for False Accusation

Accused of Colluding with Bandits, Sharing Stolen Goods, etc. Chuan Zhaoxiong Testified in Court Yesterday

Bai Zhongqi, the leader of the First Squad of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team, hired lawyer Ding Rong as his representative to sue Liang Yu, the dismissed former leader of the First Squad, in the District Court for fabricating false accusations, spreading rumors, and intending to defame him. Judge Bai Dongling held a hearing yesterday. Lawyer Ding stated the facts of the lawsuit, saying that because the dismissed squad leader Liang Yu had previous grudges against the plaintiff, he dared to fabricate accusations in October of last year in the names of Shi Chunfang, Zhang Yunhan, Zhou Wenruo, Yu Yuan, and Lü Xitian, claiming that Bai Zhongqi colluded with bandits, shared stolen goods, and had already been sentenced to imprisonment by the Special District Court. He also fabricated accusations that Liu Huai received a bribe of 2,000 yuan from Bai Zhongqi to guarantee his position as squad leader, etc., and submitted the accusations to the Central Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Police Bureau. After the bureau chief sent personnel to conduct repeated secret investigations, there was no corroborating evidence. Such actions damage reputation. At the same time, after being released on bail in the Criminal Court for falsely accusing the bureau chief, the defendant openly spread rumors to the attendant and a group of bathers in the Ximen Bathhouse on April 9, saying that Liu Huai and Bai Zhongqi were colluding with each other and that he had to kill them with a gun. Various defamatory statements can be testified to by the attendant Jin Xiaosanzi and the bather Chen Agen. As for the accusation submitted to the Central Party Headquarters and other places, it was written under duress by Fu Zhaoxiong, who has also been summoned to court and can provide evidence. The judge questioned Fu Zhaoxiong, who testified that he was 17 years old, from Ningbo, and an apprentice in a customs brokerage. In October of last year, Liang Yu told his mother to have him write two letters for him. He went with him to his house, took out eight or nine pieces of paper, and asked him to write. When he saw that it was an accusation, he refused to write. Liang Yu then closed the door, saying that the draft had already been seen and he had to write it. Therefore, he could only write it. He also said that it would be good for him. The judge ordered him to write the handwriting for comparison and instructed that because the defendant was being tried in the High Court, the case would be adjourned for another hearing.

### Performer Soliciting a Prostitute Accused of Enticement

Prostitute Returned, Madam Did Not Insist on Strict Prosecution, Liu Yucheng Acquitted

Ye Xingxiu, a Ningbo woman, 20 years old, opened a brothel named Hua Xiaoyu at 10 Fuyu Lane, Guangdong Road, and hired Zhu Axiang, an 18-year-old woman from the same hometown, as a prostitute. Another woman, Ye Ajiu, was hired to serve Ye. Zhu was the seventh child in her family, so people called her Hua Xiaoyu Laoqi. Liu Yucheng, a Tianjin performer, 22 years old, also known as Chunlei, was good at singing [unclear characters], so he was nicknamed Xiao Jinshaoshan. He was currently performing in the Dajing Troupe at the Daxin Amusement Park. He usually called Zhu Axiang’s attendant, but Ye Xingxiu was in charge. Because Liu was an occasional performer with a very low monthly income, she feared that he would not have enough money to solicit a prostitute and that something unexpected might happen, so she was very careful. At about 1 a.m. on the 5th of this month, someone suddenly called Axiang’s attendant and asked her to go to Room 203 of the Dadong Hotel as soon as possible. At that time, Ye Xingxiu ordered Ye Ajiu to accompany Zhu to the hotel. After Zhu left, Ye Xingxiu suddenly suspected that it was Liu who had called her, so she rushed to the hotel. She saw Liu and Zhu in the corridor. As she was about to go forward to monitor them, Liu and Zhu took the opportunity to escape and disappeared. Ye found two notes in a coat left by Zhu in Room 203. One note was addressed to 69 Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession (Liu's home). The other note said: Wang to Liu, Telephone 41597, South City. Ye did not immediately report the matter to the police after Zhu ran away with Liu. It was not until the day before yesterday that she had not seen Zhu return, so she went to the Laozha Police Station to report it. Chinese Detective Li Shugui first went to the Daxin Amusement Park and arrested Liu Yucheng. Based on Liu's confession, Zhu was found at 86 Yongji Lane. Yesterday morning, Liu was sent to Criminal Court II of the Special Court I. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the circumstances and charged him with enticing a woman under 20 years old in violation of Article 240, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Ye Xingxiu appeared in court and said that since the person had been found and the defendant's life was very difficult, she did not insist on strict prosecution. Zhu Axiang said that she had voluntarily left with Liu and had not been enticed by Liu. She was now willing to return to the brothel, so she asked that Liu not be punished. When questioned, Liu confessed that Zhu's sister had asked him from another town to send her regards, so he called her by telephone. He had no intention of enticing her. After Judge Ye Shengchao verified the confession, he declared Liu Yucheng not guilty in court.

### Dali Hua Steamer Kidnapping Case Telegraphed to Shantou for Interception

Yin Hongwen Reports the Truth, Arrest Made When the Steamer Was Already Weighing Anchor

Yin Hongwen of Tianjin reported to the Xiaodongmen Police Station in the French Concession at about 2 p.m. the day before yesterday that there were two women kidnapping and trafficking three children in the steerage of the China Merchants Bureau's Hong Kong-Guangdong Dali Hua Steamer. Two of the children were around two or three years old, each held by a woman, and the other was five or six years old, led by the hand. He requested that they be arrested. The police station asked how he knew that the people were kidnapping children. Yin replied that he used to be a civil servant in a certain agency and was imprisoned for some reason. He met another inmate named Chen Jinsheng. After they were released after serving their sentences, they became close friends. Recently, Chen learned that a woman was taking a child on the steamer to export today and agreed with him to guard the Jinliyuan Wharf to extort money. Around noon, Chen suddenly said that he would go and invite people to help, saying that he would ask for more money. He never returned. Now that the steamer was about to weigh anchor, he had no choice but to report it. He only needed a small reward and was willing to be punished if he made a false report. Since the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Water Police Station, the police station immediately informed the Water Police Station by telephone and dispatched detectives to investigate and arrest them. However, at this time, the Dali Hua had already started to sail and could not be chased back. Yin Hongwen was taken back to the police station and interrogated to find out the details of the discovery of the kidnapping case. Yesterday morning, a letter was prepared and sent to the China Relief Society for Women and Children. The society then telegraphed its Shantou branch to send personnel to intercept the steamer. It is estimated that the steamer will arrive in Shantou today. After the interception, it will be transferred to Shanghai and handled according to law.

She could not bear the pain and reported it to the police, who sent her to the hospital for treatment and filed a lawsuit against Zhang for assault. The defendant evaded the previous hearing, so it was postponed until yesterday morning when Judge Dai continued the hearing. Police Lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case, followed by Fan tearfully recounting the abuse she suffered from her husband and mother-in-law. She said that on the evening of the 15th of last month, the defendant, because he hated her for discovering the secret of altering bills, used ironing as an excuse and beat her again. The mother-in-law also helped with the abuse. It was only after neighbors persuaded them that they stopped. The woman's tears fell like a string when she spoke, and the inner pain expressed on her face was very obvious. However, the defendant's confession was evasive and he kept denying it. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. The court held that Zhang Zuhua's assault on his wife had been proven and could not be denied. Considering that it was his first offense, he was leniently sentenced to twenty days of detention, with a suspended sentence of two years.

His wife, Xue Genying (aged twenty-two, residing in Gaoqiao, Pudong), has filed a private lawsuit against him in the local court for abandonment. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Chen Jingyi. Xue Genying testified that she was engaged to Qiu at the age of nineteen and married him at twenty-one, eleven years ago. They have two daughters. In the past year, the defendant took a concubine and lived with her in the same place. Since July of last year, he has favored the concubine, denying her food and preventing her from returning to her parents' home. However, her mother's family is poor, so she is in dire straits, while they are comfortable and treated unequally, hence her lawsuit. Qiu Shijin testified that she is his original wife and has always been treated well. Recently, business has been slow, and he has sent less money home, but he has not taken a concubine. He is willing to live with her in Shanghai, eating when there is food and drinking congee when there is congee. The judge attempted to reconcile them, but the plaintiff demanded separate living arrangements with a monthly allowance of thirty yuan, while the defendant's monthly salary is only twenty yuan. The judge said it would be best to live together, but if not, he should provide ten yuan per month, as he still needs twenty yuan to support his parents. The defendant agreed, but the plaintiff refused. The judge repeatedly tried to persuade her for an hour, but she would not comply, so he adjourned the hearing to a later date.

### Climbing

— Xiao Mei

In this day and age, the self-aware petty bourgeoisie are probably the most miserable: on the one hand, they are unwilling to remain silent and want to do something for this society, but they cannot work as diligently as the workers; on the other hand, they do not have relatives or friends in positions of power to squeeze into important positions; they know that they are not weaker than others, but they cannot help but bow their heads to those in higher positions. Thus, there is a sense of confusion and depression. And the way to remedy this depression, which is the so-called "intention to raise eyebrows and breathe a sigh of relief," is mostly through the method of "climbing."

The so-called "climbing," as the saying goes, is "a short man climbing a tall ladder." The ladder is high and the man is short, the man is short and his legs are short, so climbing is very laborious, and a careless mistake can lead to a heavy fall. In addition, due to congenital deficiencies, it is impossible to make a comeback after falling; and before climbing, one must first "crawl" on the ground, kowtowing upwards, that is, "hoping to gain an inch of ground in front of the steps, and raise eyebrows and breathe a sigh of relief." The original intention may be good, wanting to "raise eyebrows and breathe a sigh of relief" for oneself and glorify one's ancestors, and not having any "intention to harm the public or others," but such a pathetic appearance often fails to fulfill one's wishes. Either there is no way to advance, not even "an inch of ground in front of the steps," or one climbs a few steps and falls from the tall ladder, alas!

These days, there is a news item in the newspapers saying that there is a student who has written two books, "A Review of Improving Chinese Coffins" and "An Outline of Improving Police Administration," "wanting to make a small contribution like the person from Liaodong offering a pig, but because of his humble status and weak voice, there is no way to advance, and the situation below cannot be communicated upwards," so "in a state of extreme boredom, he took a chance and forged the name card and seal of Chairman Chiang, hoping to avoid the obstruction of the gatekeepers and go straight to the important positions..."

What is the content of the two great works? It is impossible to know; did the forger of the documents have "no selfish or self-interested intention and no intention to harm the public or others"? It is also not known; but the desire to climb up, to "raise eyebrows and breathe a sigh of relief" is certain. Who would have thought that the result of climbing would be "sentenced to three months' imprisonment for the crime of forging documents." As the appeal stated, "It is as if Jia Yi presented important policy proposals, but he himself suffered extreme unrest." It is really not easy to be Jia Yi these days.

Of course, no one can be blamed for this. Climb if you climb, but who told you to forge documents?

However, one point has been recently discovered from this example of climbing, which can also be called "things that climbers must know," that is, if you want to climb, you must start climbing from outside the gate all the way up. It is impossible to "avoid the obstruction of the gatekeepers" and stride over the threshold with a straight back! Of course, whether climbing over the threshold can lead to the situation below being communicated upwards is another matter.

So what if the climbing fails? Some will think of "hiding it in the mountains, to be passed down to future generations, or there may be someone who understands," but the future generations are vast, and even if there is someone who understands, the tomb will have long been covered with trees. How can this be tolerated by the petty bourgeoisie who are unwilling to remain silent!

It is said that people should work hard for the future of mankind and society, but as it seems now, there will be no place for climbers in the future society.

### Before the Cold Kiln

— Zhi Fu

Old History, New Adaptation

The sun hasn't climbed out of the mountain ravine, and the earth is still shrouded in heavy morning mist. The desolate little village is also as quiet as if it were dead at this time; in the fields, there is only a patch of faint white morning light, becoming more and more transparent as it spreads. —

Suddenly, a burst of rapid hoofbeats echoed from the deep valley. Then a steed and a strong knight rushed into the village from afar; at the door of that broken kiln, they stopped.

The knight jumped off his horse, patted the dust that had accumulated on his armor, and carefully looked at the house with half a collapsed wall, then shouted loudly inside without hesitation:

"Kui, open the door! ... Sister San! Open the door, ah! ..."

"Who is it? -"

It was a woman's shrill voice asking from inside the house. The door still didn't make a sound; maybe she was still peeking quietly through the door!

"Sister San! It's me, I'm back." The man outside the door said impatiently.

"Oh! Is it you. -" The woman, called Sister San, answered with a giggle, and immediately pulled open the dilapidated kiln door. But when she faced her husband standing in front of her, an astonished look appeared on her smiling face; at the same time, bright eyes

waves. Staring straight at him. After a long time, she opened her mouth again:

"Ah! Pinggui, we've been separated for so long, I really didn't expect... Now you must have gained fame, right?"

"Yes." -

The husband nodded and smiled happily, then turned around and quickly tied the horse to a tree trunk beside the house. They then walked into the kiln door.

The room, which was no more than three zhang wide around, had a low roof that made people unable to stand up straight. All sides were occupied by those crude cooking utensils, tables, beds, and benches, making it even more impossible for two people to stand. Pinggui sat down on a bench beside him, looking at his long-separated virtuous wife - Wang Baochuan.

"Oh! - In these long years, life must have been really tiring for you? ..."

"No. ..." Although the wife answered this way, she was slightly red-eyed. After a while, she happily continued, "Fortunately... fortunately, you are now an official, so I can finally get ahead!"

"Alas! Don't say that." Pinggui sighed bitterly, burying his head and staring at the ground.

"Why are you still like this? -"

Baochuan's heart was very confused, and she asked him with a trembling voice.

"You really don't know!" The husband clenched his fists, widening his eyes and saying, "Since I exchanged my life for a governorship in the army, I didn't expect that in a few days, those treacherous officials and running dogs in the court started to oppose me. - Finally, they secretly reported me to the Emperor, but I didn't expect the Emperor to listen to their treachery and change me into a vanguard general, who would have to set off for the battlefield immediately. ... If it weren't for our whole country, I would have been unwilling to work in this dark court long ago! ..."

"Ah! ... Ah! ... So what's happening now?"

The fire of anger in Baochuan's heart was burning high, and she asked her husband loudly, so depressed that she could hardly breathe.

"Now? The barbaric Western Liang Kingdom is sending troops to invade our land again! Because I cannot sit idly by and watch our land change color, I am willing to give my life to the country..."

"So you're leaving me again? ..." Before he could finish speaking, the wife couldn't help but interrupt.

"You...? What does this count for!" Pinggui stood up bravely at this time, saying resolutely; "You must know that without a country, there is no home; defending the country is the duty of the people!"

Baochuan was moved by these words, and was now only sobbing sadly. But, how unbearable it was in her heart!

"When are you going to set off for the frontier?"

"Today! ... I also came back specifically to say goodbye to you."

Pinggui finally felt a surge of sadness and couldn't help but embrace her and shed tears...

It was afternoon! - Another burst of horse bells rang anxiously in the small village; it was a soldier sent by the camp to urge Pinggui to hurry back to his unit; the soldier repeatedly instructed him before leaving; "If you miss the muster, the strict military law will not forgive you!"

Pinggui was stunned for a moment; he finally ran out of the kiln door and arranged the saddle of the horse, but his wife was still crying like a tearful person-

"I... I'll see you off for a while!"

"Don't see me off." Pinggui tried his best to stop her: "Don't delay my muster, I hope I can kill the enemy sooner, bring a bloody sword, and then kill the treacherous officials and running dogs in the court... Let's reunite again, husband and wife. -"

Baochuan moved her mouth again and again, but still resolutely followed-

Suddenly, another burst of military drum sounds came from afar, it was time for the assembly! - This time, Pinggui's heart trembled, and he no longer cared about his wife beside him. He got on the saddle and added a whip: the horse pulled away its hooves and galloped forward...

The wife fell in front of the cold kiln, struggling to crawl, desperately shouting:

"Pinggui! You...: Come back ah..."

"Go into the kiln, Baochuan! ... Don't remember me, take care of your life! ..."

The husband only turned back and comforted her once, and immediately, both man and horse flew across the valley!

### Selling People

— Ma Jia

That people can be appraised and sold is not a new thing. Since the slave society, people have been assigned prices. Therefore, the phenomenon of "selling people" doesn't seem so strange! However, "selling people" is, after all, not like "selling pigs" or "selling cows," where they are cut open with knives and sold in pieces, or led with ropes to the market for shouting sales. The way people sell people is very subtle. For example, modern marriage is a subtle method of selling people. Under the cover of the spectacle of marriage, a woman is sold to a man! Of course, in this commodity society, there are extremely many ways of so-called "selling people," but all are covered by a layer of curtain.

But the years are indeed getting worse year by year. Nowadays, "selling people" is no longer about establishing names to create disguised sales. The open "shouting sales" on the streets of Shanghai are not a recent fact. "Do you want children? Do you want them?..." These sorrowful cries initially gave people goosebumps all over, but over time, they became accustomed to them, and therefore no longer paid attention.

This year, there are disasters in various places. Newspapers, in addition to reporting that the victims are eating grass roots and bark, or stone cakes slightly mixed with flour (although eating these cakes can only extend life by a maximum of three months), also have news about "selling people." In Mixian, Henan, wives and daughters are sold, openly "negotiating prices." Young and slightly beautiful ones are twenty or thirty yuan, followed by ten or more yuan to four or five yuan. A boy can be "sold off" for sixty cents of silver! What is the difference between this "price list" and the "menu" in a Shanghai hotel? Dishes are priced based on whether they "taste good" or not, while women are priced based on whether they are "beautiful" or not. Isn't this a great tragedy of humanity? In front of the "Goddess of Mercy" in various large temples, pious beautiful women kneel, asking the "Goddess of Mercy" to give them a son, but now a son in Mixian, Henan, is only worth sixty cents of silver! Furthermore, newspapers often carry news of husbands catching their wives in adultery, but in Mixian, Henan, a man openly sells his own wife, slightly beautiful ones, for twenty or thirty yuan! Can you say this is a contradiction of humanity? No! This is precisely a scene of a great human tragedy!

"How to eliminate this unbearable human tragedy?" I raise this question.

### Hutong Symphony

— Shui Mo

The slanting sunlight shines on the quiet hutong. The foxtail grass on the wall is blown by the gentle breeze in the soft light, undulating like waves, making a low, sobbing sound. A few drowsy camels shake their hanging bells, walking slowly in the sunlight, leaving deep footprints on the sandy soil of the hutong.

A desolate sound of the stringed instrument ripples through the quiet air. A blind fortune teller paces slowly in the hutong. He gropes in the small lanes, his withered thumb tremblingly plucking the moon lute. The thin strings ring out with a trembling, painful cry, as if lamenting the blind fate of the master.

Tang, tang, dang,

Children doing the flower drum opera are jumping and singing the yangko. Children dressed as cowherds are teasing girls dressed as rice transplanters in a playful manner. After a few lines of dialogue, they strike the small gong and sing melodiously. This innocent, simple, and primal music earns laughter from the onlookers.

Drip, drip, drip, the old goods exchanger walks by, shaking a small drum. A tall man, carrying a basket, shouts with a broken, hoarse voice: "Hard-flour cakes..."

At night, the cries of the hawkers seem so miserable. "Radishes like pears, spicy to exchange," an old voice shouts with all its might, "Candied hawthorns!"

Every night they shout like that, even in sandstorms and snow, they stagger into the hutong, shouting at the top of their voices. Beside the carrying pole, the faint light of the oil lamp illuminates the faces of the old people, deep wrinkles on their foreheads, their hair also gray. They dejectedly carry the pole... Their lives are weighed down by the heavy burden, like a clump of weeds. Their growth, prosperity, and withering seem to be predetermined by fate. Everyone walks the same path. Growing up in a dirty, noisy tenement, burdened with the fate of the family from a young age, they cannot remove the weight on their backs even when they are old. Perhaps in their homes, hungry children are leaning against the doorframe, hoping that their elderly grandfather will bring back a day's food....

Late at night, when the cries of the hawkers have disappeared, the strong wind blows up dust and sand, and the hutong is hazy with howling wind.
