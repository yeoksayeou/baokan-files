### Relief Committee Invites Three Ministries to Discuss Serious Disaster in Sichuan, Henan, and Shaanxi Provinces

Drafting Fundamental Disaster Relief Measures, Zhu Qinglan Flew from Shaanxi to Lanzhou Yesterday

[Nanjing] The Relief Committee invited representatives from the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and Industries on the 30th to discuss disaster relief measures for various provinces. After detailed discussions of the disaster relief opinions put forward by the three ministries, it was resolved that the Relief Committee would draft a fundamental disaster relief outline based on the opinions of the various ministries and the Executive Yuan's review of the Sichuan disaster relief case. It would then be jointly submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is understood that the opinions put forward by the various ministries include disaster prevention, that is, preventive matters such as water conservancy, afforestation, and well-drilling, and disaster relief, including work relief, agricultural loans, price stabilization, and the Agricultural Bank's handling of agricultural loans. The Relief Committee will draft an outline according to these principles. After the draft is completed, it will be discussed by the three ministries and then submitted for approval. (30th Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Zhu Qinglan flew from Shaanxi to Lanzhou on the 30th to inspect the disaster situation in Gansu. On the way back, he will inspect the disaster relief situation in Shaanxi and Henan before returning to Nanjing. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

The remaining 300,000 yuan will be allocated to the 69 slightly affected counties at the discretion of the authorities, but the disaster situation is strange, and a drop in the bucket is of no help. (30th Dispatch)

[Chengdu] The disaster situation in various counties of Sichuan has been carefully reviewed, and the levels have been determined as follows: ㊀ 26 severely affected counties: Qijiang, Nanxi, Jiang'an, Hejiang, Nazha, Fengjie, Zhongxian, Yuejiang, Nanbu, Wusheng, Yilong, Tongnan, Yanting, Jiange, Cangxi, Guangyuan, Langzhong, Zhaohua, Beichuan, Pingwu, Daxian, Bazhong, Binxi, Tongjiang, Jinghua. ㊁ 46 moderately affected counties: Xichong, Suining, Zitong, Jianwei, Gongxian, Qingfu, Junlian, Xingwen, Gulan, Shunan, Nanbei, Shizhu, Liangshan, Qu County, Guang'an, Yingshan, Rongxian, Renshou, Weiyuan, Jinkou, Jiangbei, Hechuan, Changshou, Fengdu, Wanxian, Yunyang, Dazhu, Linshui, Dianjiang, Changshou, Peng'an, Nanchong, Anyue, Pengxi, Lezhi, Anxian, Maoxian, Liban, Maogong, Songpan, Jingyan, Neijiang, Gaoxian, Fuling, Guson. ㊂ The remaining 69 counties are classified as lightly affected.

[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan believes that the disaster situation in Sichuan, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces this year is extremely serious. In addition to allocating funds to the Relief Committee to carry out emergency relief in Henan, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces, it has recently received repeated reports from these provinces that the disaster situation is serious. Expanding fundamental relief is necessary to alleviate the disaster. A few days ago, it ordered the Relief Committee to quickly draft fundamental relief measures and submit them for review and approval. The Relief Committee specially invited the Ministries of Finance, Industries, and Interior on the 30th to hold a meeting for discussion. The attendees from the various ministries expressed many opinions. As a result, it was decided that the Relief Committee would collect the opinions of the various ministries and immediately draft fundamental disaster relief measures. This draft will be roughly completed within the next week, and a second meeting will be held to discuss it before submitting it to the Executive Yuan for instructions. It is reported that the draft will be divided into two categories: disaster relief and disaster prevention, distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent matters, and stipulating measures to eliminate disasters. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] According to the Relief Committee, Sichuan relief will involve work relief, agricultural loans, price stabilization, tax exemptions, and the abolition of miscellaneous taxes to assist the rural economy and reduce the burden. Regarding agricultural loans, the Agricultural Bank will plan to proceed. The rest will be handled after Chairman Zhu returns to Nanjing and liaises with the central and local authorities. Sichuan has requested the issuance of 15 million yuan in disaster relief bonds, but the funding issue is still under discussion. The central government has allocated more than 350,000 yuan for Guizhou disaster relief. Guizhou Province has requested more than 2 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance has dispatched Inspector Yan Guofu to Shanghai on the 29th and will fly from Shanghai to Sichuan and then to Guizhou on the 30th to investigate and consult with local authorities. The matter will be reviewed after a report is submitted. The central government has allocated 300,000 yuan in bonds for Gansu relief, equivalent to approximately 210,000 yuan in cash, plus 100,000 yuan in cash and more than 10,000 yuan raised by Chairman Zhu in Beiping, which was remitted on the 30th, totaling more than 320,000 yuan in cash. It is now planned to consult with the Shanghai Charity and Disaster Relief Federation to raise funds from the community to meet urgent needs. Relief Committee member Du Yannian has arrived in Lanzhou, and Chairman Zhu will also arrive in Lanzhou today to jointly handle emergency relief. (30th Dispatch)

### Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes Amendments to Draft Constitution

Also Passes Amendments to the National Assembly Organization Law and the Guangdong Railway Public Bond Regulations

[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan held its 101st meeting on the morning of the 30th. Sixty-eight members, including Zhao Maohua, were present. Sun Ke presided. Secretary-General Liang Hancao had already gone to Shanghai to represent President Sun in congratulating President Yu on his birthday, so Secretary Chen Haicheng substituted. The agenda included: 1. Amending Articles 6 and 11 of the Regulations on Medals and Awards for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. It was resolved to pass the amendment as reviewed by the Military Affairs Committee. The main point of the amendment is to strictly limit the scope of awarding honorary swords as stipulated in the current law. Only senior officers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who have received the highest-grade medals and have made meritorious contributions in battle or achieved distinguished service shall be awarded honorary swords. 2. Amending the draft articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China. It was resolved to pass the amendment as reviewed by the eight-member committee, deleting Article 146 of the original draft and renumbering the original Articles 147 and 148 as Articles 146 and 147. 3. Amending the Law on the Organization of the National Assembly. It was resolved to pass the amendment as reviewed by the twenty-two-member committee. 4. Amending the Law on the Election of Representatives to the National Assembly. It was resolved to pass the amendment as revised by the twenty-two-member committee. 5. Extending the collection of the Customs Surtax for one year. It was resolved to pass the proposal as reviewed by the Finance and Economic Committees, allowing the extension of the surtax collection for one year from July 1 of this year. 6. The Regulations and Amortization Schedule for the 26th Year of the Republic of China Guangdong Province Railway Construction Public Bonds. It was resolved to pass the amendment as reviewed by the Finance and Economic Committees. 7. Amending the table of official ranks for diplomatic and consular officials. It was resolved to pass the amendment as reviewed by the Foreign Affairs and Legal System Committees, changing it to the table of official ranks and salaries for diplomatic and consular officials. 8. Amending Articles 17 and 19 of the Regulations on the Organization of Overseas Embassies and Consulates. It was resolved to pass the amendment as reviewed by the Foreign Affairs and Legal System Committees. The main point of the amendment is to change the original reference to the "table of official ranks for diplomatic and consular officials" in the two articles to the "table of official ranks and salaries for diplomatic and consular officials." (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)

[Nanjing] When the Legislative Yuan reviewed the third and fourth proposals on the morning of the 30th, Bo Bingchang reported on the review process. He said that the reasons for amending the two proposals were political rather than legal, so the committee members were only responsible for the legislative technique. Now, based on the central government's issued amendment points, the two laws have been modified in wording. The central government's clarification of the powers of the Constituent National Assembly and the First National Assembly, and the cancellation of the power to designate representatives after they have been elected, while adding the power of appointment, is indeed a reasonable measure. Subsequently, he gave a detailed report on the amendment of the two notes. Then, the chairman ordered Secretary Tang Shiwei to read out the amended articles of the two laws. There was only occasional debate when reading Article 2 of the National Assembly Organization Law, because that article stipulated that members of the National Government and the heads of the various Yuan, ministries, and commissions of the National Government may attend the National Assembly as observers. Sheng Zhenwei questioned the definition of "heads of the various Yuan, ministries, and commissions of the National Government." Fu Bingchang replied that there were precedents for this kind of provision in past legislation, meaning the top-ranking official of each Yuan, ministry, and commission of the National Government. The chairman said, "Then, the vice-presidents of the various Yuan will not be able to attend the National Assembly as observers?" Fu Bingchang replied that was indeed the case. Di Ying said that the list of observers should be clearly specified, because the so-called "heads of the various Yuan, ministries, and commissions of the National Government" was not very clear. The local courts are also subordinate to the National Government. Would the presidents of those courts also be able to attend the National Assembly as observers? The chairman also agreed with Di's proposal. Fu Bingchang replied again that the "various Yuan" referred to in this law naturally referred to the Five Yuan. Fu also said humorously, "No one would mistake the Central Hospital for a Yuan mentioned in this law." After this explanation, the committee members unanimously advocated maintaining the amendment. The remaining amended articles of the two laws were passed smoothly according to the review results. All amendments to the two laws will be submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation by the Legislative Yuan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)

[Nanjing] The proposal to issue Guangdong Railway Construction Public Bonds was proposed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways. The reason is that Guangdong Province is located on the coast and is a key area for communication between China and foreign countries. Its position in economic and cultural terms is extremely important. At present, inland transportation relies only on the Yuehan line, which is far from enough to meet the actual needs. Considering the situation, the Guangzhou-Meixian railway is an urgent project to connect the southeast and inland areas and develop the economy. It is appropriate to do everything possible to raise funds to build it as soon as possible. However, the construction cost of the railway is estimated to be about 55 million to 50 million yuan in national currency. At a time when domestic financial resources are insufficient, it is difficult to allocate such a large sum. It is also not easy for domestic banking groups to borrow the entire amount. Therefore, issuing these pound bonds is expected to utilize foreign capital. When the Legislative Yuan reviewed the proposal on the 30th, Ma Yinchu made a review report, saying that because China's financial credit is gradually becoming solid, the sales of these bonds will be no problem. It is expected that after the issuance of these bonds, 40 million yuan will be borrowed from abroad first, and the remaining 10 million yuan needed for the construction of the Guangdong-Meixian Railway will be made up by raising equity funds or through investment from banking groups. Ma Yinchu said that the Guangdong-Meixian Railway is planned to connect with the Zhegan Railway in the future, which is indeed a major route connecting the southeast and inland areas. After Ma's report, the committee members unanimously passed it without objection, with only slight modifications to the wording of the regulations. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)

[Nanjing] The current table of official ranks for diplomatic and consular officials is divided into special appointment first class, senior appointment second class, recommended appointment five classes, and delegated appointment three classes, which has already been passed through legislative procedures. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the position of Consul-General is only listed as a recommended appointment, while the duties of Consuls-General in various places vary in complexity. Some only manage the affairs of their own consulates, while others oversee the affairs of various consulates. Their positions are also different. In the past, in order to give preferential treatment to Consuls-General with deeper qualifications and heavier responsibilities, the treatment of ministers was adopted as an expedient measure. Now, in order to adapt to the actual situation, it is proposed to divide Consuls-General into senior and recommended appointments. Therefore, it is requested to amend the table. When the Legislative Yuan handed the case over to the Foreign Affairs and Legal System Committees for review, it was considered necessary to amend it. However, after consulting the Ministry of Personnel, it was proposed to re-divide the official ranks and stipulate the corresponding salaries in order to be consistent with the Provisional Table of Official Ranks and Salaries for Civil Officials to facilitate personnel administration. The two committees also agreed with the opinion of the Ministry of Personnel. Therefore, as a result of the review, the table of official ranks for diplomatic and consular officials was changed to the table of official ranks and salaries for diplomatic and consular officials. The Legislative Yuan also passed the review result of the two committees on the 30th. Except that the specially appointed ambassador remained at 800 yuan and the delegated clerk remained divided into three levels of 160 yuan, 180 yuan, and 200 yuan, the senior appointment was divided into eight levels, ranging from 430 to 680 yuan, with an increase of 30 yuan for each level above 400 yuan and an increase of 40 yuan for each level above 500 yuan. The recommended appointment was divided into ten levels, ranging from 220 yuan to 400 yuan, with an increase of 20 yuan for each level. Among the senior and recommended appointments, the ranking of diplomatic and consular officials is mostly distinguished according to the current system, only adding the provision that Consuls-General can be ranked as senior appointments. It is also heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to set up senior appointed Consuls-General in Singapore, Batavia, Manila, Ottawa, Vladivostok, and New York as a trial. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)

If it is insufficient, the Ministry of Railways shall allocate funds to make up the full amount.

Article 10. The face value of these public bonds shall be £100 and £50. Article 11. These public bonds shall be in bearer form and may be freely bought, sold, and mortgaged.

(Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)

[Nanjing] Minister of Finance Kong previously submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan stating, "The Customs Surtax is levied on imported and exported goods at 5% of the customs duty rate. All tax revenue is included in the temporary section of the national budget to subsidize finance. However, because this surtax is temporary in nature, the original plan stipulated that it would be collected until June 30 of this year. Now, when preparing the general estimate of national revenue for the 26th year, after a detailed examination of the national financial situation, it is deemed necessary to temporarily maintain the originally levied Customs Surtax. This is because the national budget revenue and expenditure have long been insufficient. In recent years, construction projects have flourished, and the annual deficit has been enormous. Customs duties are the main source of national revenue. Although the Customs has been trying to block smuggling in North China, it has not yet been completely eliminated, and it is difficult to expect tax revenue to be prosperous for a while. Therefore, the Customs Surtax revenue has been approved and listed in the temporary section of the general estimate of revenue under the jurisdiction of the Ministry for the 26th year at 15,504,183 yuan to relieve national expenditures. In addition to submitting the general estimate to the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics of the National Government for review in accordance with regulations, a proposal is hereby prepared, respectfully requesting your esteemed Yuan to review and approve the extension of the collection of the Customs Surtax for one year from July 1, 1937, which is truly convenient." The proposal was passed by the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the Central Political Council for approval, and then sent to the Legislative Yuan for review.

Kawagoe Can Only Return to His Post at the Earliest in June

[Nanjing] Japanese Embassy Counselor to China, Hidaka Noburo, arrived in Nanjing at 2:30 PM on the 30th. During Kawagoe's period back in Japan, Hidaka will act as chargé d'affaires, but will not concurrently serve as the Consul-General in Nanjing. The reason is that Foreign Ministry employee, Fukuijun Ren, has already been appointed to that position. Hidaka previously served as the Consul-General in Nanjing three years ago, and was subsequently promoted to Director of the Personnel Division of the Foreign Ministry. Now he is returning to his old post. According to Shimizu, Kawagoe can only return to his post at the earliest in June, because there are many diplomatic affairs to handle and the parliamentary situation is not easy to understand for the time being. Although the Japanese cabinet has the power to request the dissolution of parliament an unlimited number of times, according to past historical facts, it has only dissolved it twice at most. This is because repeatedly dissolving parliament without any reason may arouse resentment from the people. As for administrative reform plans such as the newly established Planning Agency, they belong to changes in the official system and can be implemented without going through legislative procedures. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)

Over two thousand people attended, including Long Yun, Ren Ke澄, Wu Qijian, Hao Mengxian, representatives from Guizhou, and heads of various organs and groups.

There is a great shortage of both talent and funds. He hoped that the central government would provide assistance and that the members of the inspection group would provide as much guidance as possible. Then, Chief Chu gave a reply, first saying that this time it only took 106 and a half hours to reach Yunnan from Beijing.

Develop local resources; 2. Adjust the supply of products; 3. Promote true unity. He hoped that the branch lines of various roads would be completed as soon as possible.

Also, Deputy Chief Wu Liande told reporters that it is a great honor to have successfully completed the long march.

Current Commentary

### German Planes Bomb Basque Ancient Capital

— Hua

The Spanish rebel army's attempt to capture Madrid has now apparently failed. However, recently Mola's rebel army suddenly advanced north, invading the Basque Republic and approaching Bilbao, a key port in northern Spain. Judging from the current situation, the fall of Bilbao seems imminent, which is of considerable importance to the development of the entire Spanish war situation.

If the fall of Málaga, a key port in southern Spain, last month was due to the participation of a large number of Italian troops, then the breakthrough of the Basque Republic in the north was entirely due to the help of the German air force. According to recent news reports, hundreds of German planes bombed Guernica, the ancient capital of the Basque region, and Durango, the shield of Bilbao, for more than three hours. Flames were everywhere, and massacres occurred everywhere. The number of deaths in the Spanish civil war has now reached a record high. Such a terrifying and brutal war is naturally difficult for the relatively weak Basque Republic to sustain. On the evening of the 28th, the Basque army abandoned Durango, which is only sixteen miles from the port of Bilbao. If the rebel army advances one step further, this famous port will fall into the hands of the fascist rebels.

However, although the rebel army has achieved this victory, international public opinion has been greatly agitated. Guernica is an ancient capital of Spanish civilization, but now it has been bombed into ruins by German planes for no reason. Countless women, children, and civilians in the Basque region were indiscriminately shot to death by machine guns. Naturally, this is what the German military calls the "terror annihilation" offensive method. However, all people of humanity in various countries of the world cannot understand the true intention of such a cruel massacre. Therefore, members of the British Labour Party and Liberal Party have questioned the cabinet about this, demanding that Foreign Secretary Eden file a protest. And various newspapers in London, from the far-right "The Times" to the more left-leaning "Daily Herald," have all expressed sympathy and indignation, on the one hand, mourning the innocent and tragic deaths of women and children, and on the other hand, condemning the cruel actions of the German army.

In Berlin, in view of the outrage of world public opinion, a false denial was issued, but this denial cannot cover up the eyes and ears of the people of the world. On the 29th, the Associated Press reported that 1,500 German troops had landed in San Sebastián, 51 miles from the port of Bilbao. Now everyone also knows that German Ambassador to Spain General Faupel is the main planner of the rebel army's operations. Fair-minded people in the international community have long said that the war in Spain now is not a war between the rebel army and the government army, but a war between Germany and Italy against Spain.

However, such a war that violates international justice and disregards general humanity cannot last long even if it temporarily achieves partial victories. General Miaja, commander-in-chief of the Madrid defense forces, put it well: "Spain will never tolerate the victory of foreigners. Those who have invaded our country have ultimately failed, because the most deeply rooted emotion of the Spanish people is the demand for independence. Spain fought against the Moors and drove them out of the country. It also prevented the French from invading, preventing them from gaining a foothold in Spain. In short, the rebel army will ultimately fail because they lack a most basic condition, namely, the support of the Spanish people." (Quoted from the April issue of the American "Modern History Material") These powerful words are worth believing.

### Anglo-Japanese Cooperation Negotiations Begin in London

Is this a prelude to Japan's shift in its China policy? Tokyo neither confirms nor denies.

[London] It is learned today that Japan has begun informal talks with Britain to discuss Far Eastern issues. The American diplomatic authorities have also been notified. If the talks go well, Britain welcomes American cooperation. It is said that when Japanese Ambassador to Britain Yoshida spoke with the former British Ambassador to China and current Deputy Foreign Secretary Cadogan, Yoshida vigorously advocated that the powers should financially and economically assist China. Although Yoshida's proposal is quite hollow, this move can also prove that Japan intends to adopt a more moderate policy toward China. Some people even believe that the visit of Prince Chichibu, the Emperor of Japan's brother, to Britain to attend the coronation ceremony of the British King can also indirectly indicate that the Anglo-Japanese talks have been approved by the Japanese imperial court. However, diplomatic circles here dare not determine whether these talks represent a change in Japan's China policy, or whether they are a temporary retreat by the Japanese military in order to wait for the diplomatic atmosphere to improve slightly. If Japan can truly prohibit smuggling during the talks, it will be enough to prove its good faith, and any actions by the powers can improve the atmosphere in the Far East. It is said that Britain has solemnly stated that it does not intend to conclude any agreement without the participation of the United States. (National Telegram, 29th)

[Nanjing] Regarding the news transmitted by the Associated Press from London that Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigeru Yoshida has begun to discuss the issue of Anglo-Japanese cooperation in China with British Deputy Foreign Secretary and former Ambassador to China Cadogan, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that he could neither confirm nor deny it. (Central News Agency Telegram, 30th)

[London] Regarding the Japanese reports that talks have been held in London in order to seek an understanding between the United States and Japan, Reuters has recently learned that although both Britain and Japan seem to intend to improve relations between the two countries, no such talks have begun to date.

### Japanese General Election Voting Not Very Enthusiastic

Six current cabinet members have no voting rights; former Seiyukai president votes despite illness.

[Tokyo] The election battle that has been waged across the country for the past month has ended on the 29th. The voting, in which the people will issue a solemn judgment on the struggle between the government and the political parties, will begin simultaneously across the country at 7:00 a.m. on the 30th and end at 6:00 p.m. The votes of 14,610,000 voters nationwide will determine the fate of more than 800 candidates and the trend of the political situation, so the outcome is of great significance. (Domei News Agency Telegram, 30th)

[Tokyo] The general election has begun uniformly across the country since 7:00 a.m. on the 30th. The weather in Tokyo is clear today, but voters are slow to come forward, so the rate of abstention seems to be quite high. The national voting situation generally has the same tendency, which is a reflection of the characteristics of the election. This shows the low profile of the political war. In addition to the five cities that began counting votes immediately after the deadline, all other places will begin counting votes uniformly at 8:00 a.m. on the 1st. Although the competition for the first party between the political and civil parties is of general interest, the election results have extremely subtle implications for the future development of the political situation, so all sectors are focusing on the outcome of today's voting.

Former Seiyukai President Suzuki, who has been silent for a long time, also accompanied his sick body to the Kojimachi Elementary School polling place at 9:40 a.m. today, accompanied by his family, to cast his tragic vote. When the general public saw his condition, they were all filled with emotion. (Domei News Agency Telegram, 30th)

[Tokyo] This general election, with slogans such as "ideal elections, ideal people, ideal parliament," began simultaneously across the country at 7:00 a.m. this morning. Although the Hayashi Cabinet has no government party, it dissolved the parliament and held a general election in order to demand the self-awareness and awakening of political parties. Under these special circumstances, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, which have been inactive for a long time, resolutely raised the anti-government banner and launched a grand battle line. The Hayashi Cabinet is most concerned about the results of its acceptance of national judgment. However, in this way, more than half of the ten current cabinet members of the Hayashi Cabinet, reaching six, have no voting rights, which is a rare phenomenon. That is, Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai are active-duty soldiers and have no voting rights. Communications Minister Kodama is a count and has no rights. Foreign Minister Sato has been abroad for a long time and only returned to the country a few weeks ago. Commerce Minister Godo also trusts Manchuria and has no voting qualifications. As for Salt Minister Shiono, who is judging violations of the election law, he also came to Tokyo from Nagoya and has not reached the statutory number of days, so he has no right to vote. Only Prime Minister Hayashi (not an active-duty soldier), Interior Minister Kawaharada, Finance Minister Yuki, and Agriculture Minister Yamazaki can express their hearts with a vote. Shiono joked to others, "The Hayashi Cabinet is a six-to-four cabinet without rights," and then laughed loudly. (Domei News Agency Telegram, 30th)

### Kobe Tram Workers Implement Slowdown

Demanding salary increase due to rising prices.

[Kobe] The Kobe City Tram Workers' Association, due to rising prices and difficult living conditions, demanded that the city authorities increase wages, and implemented a slowdown starting at 10:00 a.m. on the 29th. The heads of the Electricity Bureau held a meeting to discuss countermeasures, but because the workers did not violate service regulations and implemented the slowdown within legal limits, it was impossible to take action. The workers are likely to go on strike, and the future is not optimistic. (Domei News Agency Telegram, 30th)

It is investigated that during the train derailment incident, many people were killed or injured. However, the news was only announced today.

### Moscow New Canal Opens to Traffic

Capable of accommodating large ships, facilitating transportation.

[Moscow] The first ship to sail on the Moscow-Volga Canal arrived at the Khimki port near Moscow yesterday. A large fleet of ships dedicated to the canal will continue to arrive on May 2. The canal is 128 kilometers long and took more than four years to build. From now on, it can supply drinking water to Moscow residents, increasing the per capita daily water consumption from 135 liters to 600 liters. At the same time, it is also an important waterway, with a total of 30 million tons of cargo transported annually, connecting the new port of Moscow with the Baltic Sea, White Sea, Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and Sea of Azov, and shortening the water distance between the capital and Leningrad by 1,100 kilometers.

The canal is 85.5 meters wide and 5.5 meters deep, capable of accommodating Volga River giant ships and cargo ships with a load of 1,800 tons. Along the river, there are 11 drainage locks, 3 concrete dams, 8 earth dams, 8 hydroelectric power plants, 19 iron bridges, and 5 pumping stations to pump water to the locks, as well as other large buildings, totaling 240.

The total earthwork for the entire canal is 202 million cubic meters, and the concrete work is 3,112,000 cubic meters. Many difficulties were encountered during construction, all of which were successfully resolved. For example, the impeller pump for pumping water is made in the Soviet Union, and each pump can pump 25 cubic meters of water per second. Part of the project was undertaken by prisoners, enabling them to receive industrial training, learn useful work, and receive political and moral transformation. (TASS Telegram, 30th)

### London Streetcar Workers Go on Strike

Effective from midnight yesterday

[London] The representative meeting of London bus drivers has recently decided to order all bus employees in the central district to stop working from midnight tonight. Other transportation workers will continue to work as usual until they receive a notice from the Transportation Workers Union. (Reuters Telegram from Central News Agency, 30th)

[London] More than 30,000 bus drivers and conductors in the London area recently demanded that the city transportation bureau implement a 7.5-hour workday, and decided that if this goal could not be achieved, all workers would go on strike starting at midnight on the 30th of this month. According to official sources, negotiations between the transportation bureau and worker representatives have failed, so the strike is now unavoidable. (Havas Telegram from Central News Agency, 29th)

[London] The London bus strike, which was decided to begin tomorrow night, has become inevitable due to the breakdown of negotiations between the two parties. Furthermore, because the meeting held in Chelmsford today voted to assist bus workers in certain counties who have already informally declared a strike, thousands of bus workers in various counties are likely to declare a strike at the same time. It is investigated that the London bus workers are demanding a reduction in working hours, while the workers in other counties intend to slightly increase wages and request that the General Transportation Union recognize the existing long-term workers as formal strikers. Furthermore, the London Transportation Bureau currently has 5,000 buses, carrying approximately 5 million passengers daily. (Reuters Telegram from Central News Agency, 29th)

### Spanish Northern Rebel Army Captures Basque Ancient Capital

Continuing to Advance Towards Bilbao in Three Routes; More Than 20 Planes Fiercely Bomb

National Army on the Biscay Province Front National Army occupied the ancient city of Guernica in the Basque Country this afternoon without encountering resistance. The city has been completely destroyed since it was bombed by planes a few days ago. (Havas Telegram from Central News Agency, 29th)

Sagamonga City. The National Army is progressing on the front lines of the Basque Autonomous Region and has occupied the ancient city of Guernica and various coastal villages and towns in the east, capturing 400 officers and soldiers of the government army and seizing a large amount of military supplies. The 13 battalions of the Guernica city defense force have fled to the city of Bilbao, and the National Army is now less than 20 kilometers away from the city. (Central News Agency Telegram, 30th)

Anday. The rebel army of Mola in northern Spain entered the city of Guernica today and ordered its troops to enter Bilbao on Sunday. The armies are now advancing in three routes, and Italian troops are also participating. (National Telegram, 29th)

Bilbao. The Basque army, pressured by the rebel army, has retreated to a new defense line today. This line extends from the villages of Mendaca and Bomiwo along the coast to the cities of Durango and Cubaga. They are now trying their best to defend Bilbao and have recruited a large number of new soldiers to the front lines to defend against the enemy. (National Telegram, 29th)

Port of Bilbao. The government army is covering the retreat of the front-line troops near the town of Eibar in the Basque Country and is conducting a counterattack in the city of Durango, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. As for the 24 bombers and 6 fighter planes belonging to the National Army, they bombed the port and nearby villages and towns twice at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, dropping a total of 300 bombs, including incendiary bombs. Then, in the town of Elcorriel, 12 kilometers from the port, they opened fire with machine guns, indiscriminately shooting at residents who were fleeing in panic.

Bilbao. Today, 15 planes of the National Army attacked the vicinity of four British cargo ships in the port of Bilbao, with bombs falling all around. The attack lasted for about fifteen minutes, but none of the bombs hit. The planes of the National Army were probably made in Germany. It is heard that the National Army warship "España" had previously issued a wireless warning stating that British ships entering the port of Bilbao would inevitably be bombed and machine-gunned by the National Army. Therefore, the attack on Bilbao by the planes of the National Army this time seemed to be specifically aimed at British cargo ships.

### President of the Basque Country Appeals to the World

Do not allow this cruel act to be repeated; Britain and France decide to help evacuate residents of Bilbao.

Saint-Jean-de-Luz. Today, the President of the Basque Autonomous Region delivered a speech on the Vicaia radio station to various countries around the world, pointing out that the National Army recently wantonly bombed the ancient city of Guernica, and countless women and children suffered poisoning, appealing to the civilized world not to allow this cruel act to be repeated, and demanding that various countries should protect the city of Bilbao (300,000 women and children. Finally, the Basque President declared that the Basque army will definitely spare no effort to resist the invasion of the National Army. (National Maritime Telegram, 29th)

City of Bilbao. After the city of Guernica was bombed recently, the General Headquarters of the National Army issued a proclamation and broadcast it through the Berlin radio station, the content of which attributed the responsibility for the destruction of the city of Guernica and other cities in the Basque Autonomous Region to the extreme leftists of the region. Regarding this matter, the President of the Autonomous Region, Agirre, also issued a proclamation, protesting the National Army's bombing of undefended cities and refuting the National Army's claim that the extreme leftists were responsible, saying that this was a deliberate slander, and that all civilized people should condemn it. "We sincerely hope that other countries will organize an investigation team to come and investigate the truth on the spot, so that the barbaric treatment suffered by the Basque people will be known to the world, and the responsibility of certain European countries for this matter will also be determined accordingly." (Havas Telegram from Central News Agency, 29th)

[London] Regarding the evacuation of residents from the port of Bilbao in the Basque Country, the responsible parties recently announced that the governments of Britain and France have now agreed to assist the government of the Basque Country in handling the evacuation, but with two conditions: ㊀ The government of the Basque Country should not have any political ideas regarding the selection of refugees leaving the country, and should notify the governments of Britain and France of the date of departure of the refugees and the number of ships used. ㊁ The National Army of Spain should promise not to interfere with the evacuation of refugees. Regarding this matter, the British diplomatic representative stationed in Anday, southern France, has received instructions to ask the National Army government to refrain from any actions by the National Army's navy and air force during the transportation of refugees out of the country. Basque people here recently announced that the government of the region intends to load refugees onto ships of the region and have British and French warships escort them to the port of Saint-Jean-de-Luz in southern France, and to establish a special committee in that port to specialize in receiving refugees and distributing them to shelters in Britain and France.

### The Ghastly State of Guernica After the Bombing

An Eyewitness Account of a City Transformed into a Scene of Carnage

Anda Yi. According to refugees who escaped from Guernica, this ancient city had a population of 13,000, about two-thirds of whom have already fled. It is said that the city was bombed by enemy aircraft on Wednesday. The streets were filled with pedestrians when the enemy planes suddenly appeared. People panicked and sought refuge in houses, but after the houses were set ablaze by incendiary bombs, they ran back into the streets, only to be machine-gunned by the enemy planes. It can be said that there was no escape to heaven or earth. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 29th)

[Paris] When the town of Guernica in Basque Country was bombed by Nationalist planes a few days ago, a Spanish priest, Onaindia, happened to be in the city and witnessed the horrific scene. He recently recounted the bombing to our correspondent here, stating that the day was a Monday, the weather was clear, and it was market day, with residents from nearby villages flocking to the town to buy various goods. Multiple Nationalist planes continuously bombed the city from 4:30 PM to 7:45 PM. First, they strafed with machine guns, then dropped ordinary bombs, and finally, they dropped incendiary bombs. As soon as the planes appeared, people abandoned their livestock and fled to the countryside and forests. The elderly and children lay in the ditches along the roads. Nationalist planes continued to fly low, machine-gunning the forests and roads everywhere. By 7:00 PM, the entire city was ablaze. Firefighters from Bilbao rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the flames, but because many residents had hastily built shelters and were huddled inside, and because the hospital was full of wounded and sick people, it was difficult to rescue them, and many perished. It is imaginable, as night fell, the tragic scene of men and women wandering through the rubble of Guernica, calling out for their sons and daughters and searching for relatives. Guernica, being an undefended city with no air defense facilities or artillery, and not even machine guns, was subjected to bombing by Nationalist planes, which is truly outrageous.

### Rebel Ship Sunk

Bilbao Port. While this port is under blockade by Nationalist warships, government aircraft have sunk the Nationalist battleship "España." This ship has a displacement of 15,700 tons, armed with eight 12-inch guns, twenty 4-inch guns, a horsepower of 15,500, and a speed of 19.5 knots per hour. It was completed in 1913.

### Spaak Elucidates Principles of Belgian Foreign Policy

Obligations of League of Nations Covenant Respected; Transit Requires Prior Belgian Consent

Brussels. Foreign Minister Spaak delivered a speech in the House of Representatives this afternoon, explaining the main principles of Belgian foreign policy. The visitors' gallery in the House was extremely crowded, and all seats for the diplomatic corps were occupied. Since the British and French governments issued a declaration a few days ago, relieving Belgium of its obligations as a guarantor state, the Belgian authorities have formally declared their diplomatic stance. This is the first time, and it is therefore highly valued by all parties. The main points of the Foreign Minister's speech were: "The Belgian government recognizes that foreign troops, according to Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, have the right to pass through Belgian territory, but with two conditions: ㊀ This right of passage must be exercised only after obtaining prior consent from Belgium. ㊁ Foreign troops must be engaged in a common action when the country permits transit." Spaak also said, "The declaration issued by the British and French governments on April 24 effectively ends Belgium's participation in any military agreements forever. I am personally very pleased about this. Belgium is willing to fully cooperate with collective peace organizations and will therefore continue to support the League of Nations. However, Belgium does not accept a certain concept of the principle of collective security, which aims to force all countries, regardless of size, to bear the same obligations. Belgium is now strengthening its national defense capabilities to resist any foreign aggression, but beyond this, no country can demand anything more from this country. In addition, Belgium has decided to cooperate with other countries to establish a Western European security pact, but if Germany does not participate in the pact, our task will not be completed. Recent declarations by German leaders have expressed a spirit of coordination, which deserves our praise, and I am always unwilling to abandon the possibility of coordination, because although there are many difficulties ahead, they are not insurmountable." Finally, the Foreign Minister mentioned the League of Nations Covenant and said that the interpretation of Article 16 of the Covenant should be determined by the General Assembly of the League of Nations, but as far as Belgium is concerned, the two conditions mentioned above are justified. The so-called first condition, that foreign troops must obtain the consent of the country before transit, is in line with the principle of national sovereignty. As for the second condition, that foreign troops must be engaged in "common action" before they can transit through Belgium, is stated in the original text of the Covenant. (Note: Article 16 of the Covenant states that any member state shall take the necessary measures to facilitate the transit of troops from other member states that are cooperating to maintain the League of Nations Covenant.) Spaak concluded, "The declarations by the British and French governments were made voluntarily by the British and French governments, but are based on Belgium's current foreign policy. If we change our foreign policy in the future, the British and French governments can change this declaration and withdraw their security guarantees for Belgium, which is of course justified in law."

### US New Neutrality Act Passed by Both Houses

President Signs, Becomes Law Immediately

[Washington] The Senate today passed the government's proposed Neutrality Act by a vote of 41 to 15. The bill had previously been passed by the House by a voice vote. President Roosevelt is currently on vacation fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, so the bill will be sent to the President's ship by airmail. It is expected to be signed before the expiration of the current temporary Neutrality Act tomorrow night. The Neutrality Act passed this time is a compromise, giving the President the power to decide on a "cash and carry" policy for the purchase of arms by belligerent countries. (Dispatch from the National News Agency, 29th)

[Washington] The reason this bill is being processed so quickly is that the current Neutrality Act will expire in a few days. If there is no new bill to succeed it, US arms and money can legally be exported to support either side in the Spanish Civil War. This new Neutrality Act is a compromise between the bills proposed by Representative McReynolds, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. McReynolds' proposal advocated for an indefinite extension of the current temporary Neutrality Act and authorized the President to selectively prohibit the export of war materials to belligerent countries. Pittman's proposal stipulated: ㊀ Prohibiting the supply of loans and arms to belligerent countries in international or domestic wars. ㊁ Other goods cannot be shipped to belligerent countries unless ownership has been transferred from Americans to foreigners. ㊂ American merchant ships must not be armed, and American citizens are not allowed to travel on ships owned by belligerent countries.

### Acting Mayor Yu Addresses the Labor and Capital Sectors

Should Realize Mutual Forbearance is for One's Own Good; Mutual Love and Maintenance

Acting Mayor Yu of this city issued a Labor Day message to the labor and capital sectors of this city, stating: "Today is International Labor Day, which is also designated as a day of commemoration by our labor compatriots. Hongjun, in view of the recent fluctuations in labor unrest in this city, cannot help but feel something and specifically express his sincerity, providing a word of advice to the labor and capital sectors of this city regarding the awareness that the labor and capital sides of our country should have at present, and the path they should take. The history of factories in our country is extremely short, and the history of factories established by our own people is even shorter. Today's social unrest and the increasing difficulties in people's lives are not caused by the oppression and exploitation of capitalists in China, but by the squeeze and threat of imported machinery and manufactured goods. As Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, 'There are no big capitalists in China, only differences between big poverty and small poverty.' He also said, 'Chinese workers are not oppressed by Chinese capitalists, but by foreign capitalists.' Understanding this, there should be no so-called labor-management disputes in our country today. Under the current circumstances, if labor and capital continue to harm each other, there is no question that both will perish. From the perspective of labor and capital themselves, our labor and capital sectors should have the awareness that 'mutual forbearance is for one's own good,' and should love and support each other. Today, those who talk about the prosperity of a country invariably mention wealth and strength, while those who talk about decline invariably mention poverty and weakness. Strength must be based on wealth, and weakness must be due to poverty. This is a clear principle. Today, the country's defense is being equipped, construction projects are being promoted, and experts and talents are being cultivated, all of which require financial resources and are related to the wealth and power of a country and its people. The quantity of a country's wealth aggregate and the thickness of its people's power aggregate depend on whether a country's industry and commerce are developed. Therefore, countries around the world today regard the success or failure of industry and commerce as a matter of survival or death for the entire nation, burying their heads in hard work and fighting to the death to seek the dumping of their country's industrial products in other countries, using various methods to break through the tariff barriers of other countries, and not hesitating to use various methods to divide and disintegrate the unity and solidarity of other nations. Our country's industry and commerce are immature, and coupled with the various restraints of unequal treaties, it is difficult to compete. However, the survival of the entire nation is at stake, and competition is unavoidable, and struggle is unavoidable. Therefore, on the one hand, the central government is working hard to eliminate various constraints, and on the other hand, it is strictly ordering factory owners and capital providers not to treat or be harsh to workers, while at the same time not condoning workers who go on strike for no reason and bring hunger and poverty upon themselves. The reason for doing so is nothing more than to seek unity from top to bottom and unity throughout the country to overcome the current life-and-death juncture of national crisis, increase national wealth and people's power, and seek the survival and happiness of the entire nation. Anything that runs counter to this not only destroys oneself, but also overthrows the country and harms the people. In a China that is so volatile, anyone with a patriotic heart and a love for the nation should not bear to do this, and should not do this. From the perspective of the survival of the entire nation, our Shanghai labor and capital sectors should have the awareness that 'mutual forbearance is for the sake of the country,' and should maintain and support each other. The prestige of the capital side is based on the efforts of the labor side, and the survival of the labor side depends on the maintenance of the capital side. Therefore, the only path for labor and capital today lies in 'mutual patience', 'mutual understanding', 'not being rejected', and 'not being exploited'. In the future, if any unavoidable hardships or irresolvable misunderstandings arise on either side of labor and capital, resulting in disputes, they should be reported to the authorities, who will properly mediate in accordance with the law. By no means should they go to extremes and become enemies of each other, so as to destroy the integrity of the national revitalization front and fall into ruin. Hongjun is ordered to temporarily manage the Shanghai government, and will do his duty for one day to maintain the Shanghai industry and commerce whose foundations are not yet solid, and the labor compatriots who work hard and endure hardship. However, those who borrow names, cause trouble and sow discord will also be punished in accordance with the law, and will never be tolerated. It is deeply hoped that the labor and capital sectors of this city will follow the central leaders' firm and patient hearts for the revitalization of the nation, and give Hongjun thorough assistance and cooperation.

After examination by Dr. Dong of the Orthopedic Hospital, a steel clip was added. As for the gunshot wound on Mrs. Liu Luo Yunqing's right hand, it was very light, only the skin was scratched and the flesh was injured.

There was no one else in the room at the time, and all the guards and servants were having breakfast in the kitchen. When Commander Liu received the note and was reading it, Wang Zhaoxiu took out a gun and fired. Commander Liu was shot in the chest below his right shoulder and shouted loudly. Mrs. Liu heard the sound and came out to see what had happened. She grabbed the assassin. The assassin fired again, shooting at Mrs. Liu, causing injury to her right hand. At this time, Commander Liu also stood up and helped his wife grab the assassin. The three of them wrestled and fell to the ground, causing Commander Liu to injure the bone of his right arm.

### Slum Dwelling Issue Concludes

Twenty-two representatives sign an agreement to voluntarily demolish by May 6th.

He Dequi, a representative from the Shanghai Municipal Council, spoke with twenty-two representatives of the slum dwellers in the Central District yesterday (the 30th), explaining the Council's resolution to demolish the shanties. He stated that the Council, to show its compassion, had decided to provide each household that had already demolished their shanty with fourteen yuan. The total expenditure for this from the Council would be around seven thousand yuan. The representatives of the slum dwellers, after hearing this message and lengthy discussion, decided to collectively and voluntarily demolish their shanties and accept the Council's subsidy. Tang Anping, Xu Xiguang, Sun Xudan, Sun Hankui, Yin Yifu, Liu Dexun, and twenty-two other representatives of the slum dwellers collectively signed an agreement, the original text of which is as follows:

Agreement: We, the representatives of the slum dwellers, now respectfully acknowledge that He, from the Shanghai Municipal Council, has informed us that according to the plan of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Works Department, there are a total of 476 shanties west of Tianlianwan Road and east of Zhaofeng Road, as well as east of Dalianwan Road and west of Qiwupu Road, south of Yulin Road, north of Yangzhou Road and Yangshupu Road, and east of Qiwupu Road, west of Lan Road, north of Danyang Road, and south of Pingliang Road, which must be completely demolished by the 4th day of May this year. This has been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Board of Directors. If the aforementioned slum dwellers can collectively and voluntarily demolish within the specified period, the Municipal Council can provide a subsidy of fourteen yuan for each shanty, as a gesture of compassion. First, the Works Department of the Municipal Council will impartially issue each shanty household a notice, and in the future, the subsidy of fourteen yuan will be issued based on this notice. All the aforementioned four hundred and seventy-six shanties must be voluntarily demolished by the slum dwellers before May 6th, 1937, of the Republic of China (Western calendar). All demolished waste straw and bamboo, etc., must be cleared by themselves before May 8th, and no rebuilding will be allowed. After all four hundred and seventy-six shanties are demolished, they can claim fourteen yuan in national currency per household from the Finance Department of the Municipal Council on May 10th (Monday) based on the previously issued notice, for their use. We, the representatives, after discussing with the slum dwellers, have resolved to collectively accept the Shanghai Municipal Council's goodwill of providing fourteen yuan per shanty to show compassion to the slum dwellers, and will voluntarily demolish all four hundred and seventy-six shanties before May 6th, and remove all the demolished waste straw and bamboo, etc., before May 8th. On May 10th, we will present the notices to the Municipal Council to claim fourteen yuan per shanty. If the four hundred and seventy-six shanties are not voluntarily demolished before May 6th, we are willing to allow the Municipal Council to send people to demolish them, and we will not object. We, the representatives of the aforementioned four hundred and seventy-six shanties, hereby sign this agreement as true.

Regarding

### Salt Affairs in Southeast Provinces

Report by Chief Inspector Hui Yangfeng

The Salt Affairs Administration previously dispatched Chief Inspector of National Salt Affairs, Hui Yangfeng, to inspect salt affairs in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces, and to liaise with the Guangxi provincial authorities on the unified control of Guangxi salt affairs. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his mission. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him, and he provided a detailed account of the inspection process, which is recorded below:

Situation of Reorganizing Salt Affairs in Various Provinces

In recent years, salt affairs in Lianghuai have been actively reorganized by the salt affairs authorities, with increasing effectiveness. In the production areas, in addition to the Huainan salt fields, which are currently being reorganized, the other fields have achieved a situation where there is no production outside the designated areas. In the sales areas, the salt marketing situation has improved compared to the previous four years. The Huai salt sold in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi was previously of poor color and quality, but now it is white with large grains, and the sodium chloride content is mostly above 87 percent. The quantity of salt sold has also increased. In the 25th year, due to adjustments in tax rates, the salt tax in border areas was reduced. As a result, not only did revenue not decrease, but it also increased on average each month. Revenue from the Hunan area was 15,257,000 yuan, an increase of 1,846,000 yuan compared to the 24th year. Revenue from the Hubei area was 15,002,700 yuan, an increase of 375,000 yuan. Revenue from the Jiangxi area was 9,457,000 yuan, an increase of 51,000 yuan. Even the quantity of salt sold in the first four months of this year is greater than that in the same period of the 25th year. The illicit fees collected by the administrative affiliate organs during the previous era of separated administration and inspection have been completely eliminated through my strict investigation. In addition, remote areas in various provinces, such as Xiangyun in Hubei and the southwestern counties of Hunan and Jiangxi, were previously mostly abandoned by the responsible salt affairs agencies, resulting in the proliferation of smuggled salt. Since the effective reorganization, tax revenues have become prosperous. In Chengnan's Hengyang, annual tax revenue was only over 300,000 yuan when the unified tax was not implemented in the 21st year, with more than 200 tax stations. Since the implementation of the unified tax, smuggled salt has gradually decreased, the number of tax stations has been reduced to over 60, and last year's tax revenue has increased to over 2 million yuan. Salt taxes in southern Jiangxi and northern Hubei have also improved. From this, it can be seen that whether the policy of completely adopting laissez-faire and allowing tax revenue to take its course can be implemented to the fullest benefit is still questionable. Modern countries mostly adopt economic control policies. In the sales areas of salt affairs, whether the agencies can be completely abolished in the near future remains to be considered. Since our country has a vast territory and inconvenient transportation, the transportation of salt must be controlled by the government to balance surpluses and deficits. How to balance salt prices, how to improve salt quality, and how to change transportation routes with the progress of transportation must all be planned at all times. Therefore, when Liu Yan of the Tang Dynasty reorganized salt affairs, he not only set up supervisors in the production areas but also set up thirteen patrol courts in the sales areas. The Tang History says, "The patrol courts in various routes recruited drivers, set up post stations facing each other, and knew the price and local interests of the four parties, even if they were very far away, in just a few days." This is clear evidence of his control over production and sales. Since economic construction is actively underway, it is difficult to reduce salt tax in practice. If the tax is levied at the production area, the tax rules cannot be reduced, and the entire salt tax must be paid at once, which merchants cannot afford. Because one-time payment of heavy taxes not only increases commercial interest rates and salt prices but also means that a monthly set of capital can only be used for half a set of business, tax revenue will be greatly affected. If salt tax cannot be reduced, then the current method of separate collection seems to still need to be maintained. The tax currently collected on the four banks of the Yangtze River amounts to 40 million yuan annually. Therefore, the salt affairs agencies in the sales areas cannot be completely abolished in the short term. However, if the tax rates of Ying salt in Hubei and Yue salt in Hunan and Jiangxi can be balanced, and the Huai salt tax rates in northern and southern Anhui can be unified, and all kinds of salt can be freely circulated, then salt affairs agencies and salt police can be greatly reduced.

Handling of the Guangdong Salt Crisis

Since Guangdong salt affairs were taken over by the central government last year, salt tax revenue has increased monthly. From the takeover to March, the total increase was over 2.4 million yuan, with an average monthly increase of approximately 400,000 yuan. The efficiency of operations has also increased daily. The corrupt habits of salt affairs officials in the past have been largely eliminated in a short period of time. During this progress, the Guangdong provincial authorities were preparing to build the Guangmei Railway. The central government adjusted the Guangdong salt tax rate to fund the construction of the railway. Merchants used the tax increase as an excuse and refused to transport salt for a month. The Salt Affairs Administration, considering the people's food and tax revenue, sent me to assist the Guangdong provincial salt affairs authorities in handling the situation accordingly. I summoned the merchants and sincerely advised them that the increased revenue was for national construction, which was crucial for survival and not comparable to ordinary administrative expenses. The people of all provinces have endured painful burdens, and Guangdong, as the cradle of the revolution, has merchants who are well aware of righteousness and should work together to overcome difficulties and consider the overall situation. The merchants were able to understand that the cooperation methods set for Guangdong salt sales in Hunan were too restrictive. If implemented, Guangdong salt would not be able to be sold, which would not only leave salt farmers without a livelihood but also greatly affect Guangdong's finances. After detailed explanation, it was specially agreed that the unified tax on Guangdong salt sold in Hunan would be reduced by five corners per dan, and that inconvenient aspects of the cooperation methods would be appropriately improved, and that these would be presented to the ministry for instructions. The important point of the original cooperation methods was to limit excessive local sales. Excessive local sales, in other words, meant smuggled salt invading Hunan. If this smuggled salt was not cracked down on, not only would Huai salt be invaded but also the sales of Guangdong salt in Hunan would be affected, resulting in a lose-lose situation. Therefore, the Guangdong authorities should strictly crack down on local sales and handle it impartially under the principle of bilateral cooperation to maintain legitimate Guangdong and Huai salt merchants. After thorough persuasion, the merchants had no further objections, and the salt transport crisis came to an end. When I traveled from Guangdong to Hunan and passed through Zhengzhou, I saw more than a dozen salt trucks.

Unified Central Control of Guangxi Salt Affairs

Since the abolition of the Guangxi Transportation Bureau, salt affairs in Guangxi have been concurrently managed by the Department of Finance, with extremely inconsistent tax rates, averaging about two yuan per dan. Tax revenue has been decreasing daily. In the 25th year, only 1.7 million yuan was collected. If Guangxi's population of 13 million is calculated at 13 catties of salt consumed per person per year, 1.69 million bales of salt should be sold. Even at a tax of two yuan, over 3 million yuan should be collected. The Salt Affairs Administration's motive for reorganizing Guangxi's salt affairs is that under the unified control of salt administration by one agency, foreign smuggling can be resisted, the supply and demand of salt production in various regions can be matched, and experienced personnel with many years of experience in managing salt affairs can be dispatched to handle it, which can make significant progress. With Guangxi's clear political situation, the reorganization of its salt affairs should be easier to achieve than in other provinces. In recent years, salt affairs in various provinces have mostly achieved results, and Guangdong's salt administration has also recently entered the right track. Furthermore, the principles of governing salt and water are the same. There is a connection between counties and even between provinces. I met with Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai of the Fifth Route Army and Chairman Huang of the Provincial Government to discuss everything in detail. Both Chairman Huang and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai were very willing to wholeheartedly assist the central government's salt affairs policy and hoped that the salt affairs authorities would select experienced personnel to handle it. I admire the progress of Guangxi's construction. The province was previously an import surplus province but has now become an export surplus province. Previously, minerals were not developed, but now gold, tin, and tungsten mines are being developed, and there is room for development. Railway construction is also being planned, which is of great significance for national defense. Although Guangxi does not have many soldiers, local order is extremely peaceful. There are no bandits except in Longzhou and Baise. The so-called three-self policy, namely "self-sufficiency," "self-reliance," and "self-defense," can be seen everywhere. On the one hand, officials are devoted to learning, and on the other hand, soldiers are devoted to the corps. All junior high school graduates should receive six months of military training, and the militia is trained by military officers. All farmers and workers must receive at least 128 hours of training. Their spirit of hard work is truly admirable.

### "Secret Code" Returns

Fang Ye Talks About His Feelings on the Performance of the Film. The film "Secret Code," produced by the Nanjing Central Film Studio, has been shown successively in Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang, and has received good reviews from over 400,000 viewers. It was screened at the Grand Theater in this city a few weeks ago, and the daily audience was packed, which was praised by Chinese and foreigners. Especially the war scenes in the content are comparable to foreign films. However, at that time, due to the limited screening period, many people regretted missing it. It is now learned that "New Light" in this city has obtained the rebroadcast rights of the film and is scheduled to be screened from today. It is said that there were many people who presold tickets yesterday.

Fang Zhi Talks About His Feelings on the Performance of "Secret Code"

The film "Secret Code" produced by the Central Photography Studio, which has already been released, can be said to have considerable contributions in terms of thought, art, and technology. Especially in terms of propaganda, it can be said to have the greatest success. However, everyone should know that the establishment of the Central Photography Studio and the emergence of relatively successful products with revolutionary consciousness today has its important significance. Simply put, the original intention of the central government to set up a film photography studio was to unite film industry figures across the country to jointly use the film industry to enlighten people's hearts, instill doctrines, improve cultural standards, improve customs, and promote national spirit. It is hoped that film industry figures across the country will recognize the importance of the film industry, actively study art, improve their style, and work together on this cultural undertaking. However, the funding and equipment of the Central Film Photography Studio are also very simple. It is difficult to produce a great work in a short period of time, and it is not easy to have this relatively successful and revolutionary product come out this time. The story of the film "Secret Code" has been disclosed in various newspapers in recent days, and I think everyone knows its general outline. Its significance is to depict a historical fact in the process of the National Revolution, so that everyone knows how our party comrades worked hard and struggled under the iron hooves of warlords, how they led the people to participate in the revolution, and finally overthrew the evil forces and gained light. It can greatly stimulate the revolutionary spirit of the audience and arouse the attention of the national film industry, which is very profound in creating a new style with national spirit. Speaking of the success of this attempt to rehearse a feature film, the first person to thank is Mr. Zhang Daofan. Mr. Zhang was able to write this script in the midst of his busy official duties, and he personally served as the director during the production, so that he could achieve good results. At the same time, it made me think that as long as we have perseverance and are not afraid of difficulties, anything can be successful. We see that Mr. Zhang is not a frequent scriptwriter, and he only takes the time to work as a screenwriter and director during his spare time, and his results are already very good. In addition to admiration, it also increases our courage to continue to work hard. I would like to ask all the directors, such as Mr. Huang Tianzuo, Liu Naou, Yu Zhongying, and Zhang Beihai, to work hard under the guidance of Mr. Zhang Daofan to complete the structure, which is also very exciting and admirable. In terms of actors, we were able to invite famous film practitioners from Shanghai, Mr. Gao Zhanfei and Shang Guanwu, as well as children of Li Keng, to come to Beijing to participate in the rehearsal and give full play to their talents, adding a lot of color to the film, which is also worthy of our admiration. In addition, the actors of the Central Film Studio were actually able to perform quite well with only a short period of training, which is even more worthy of our own comfort and can also be gratifying to the people of the country. In short, we are not at all satisfied with the completion of "Secret Code". We must continue to work hard, and in the near future, we will have a third feature film with richer content and greater significance. On the one hand, we hope that the comrades of the Central Film Studio will show a spirit of never stopping and continue to work hard. On the other hand, we hope that the comrades who are engaged in the film industry in the central and local areas will cooperate sincerely and work together to study art and improve their style, and shoot more films that improve cultural standards, improve customs, inspire national consciousness, and promote national spirit, so that the progress of China's film industry can gradually be recognized by countries around the world, and make the international community think of the progress of China's entire country due to the recognition of the progress of China's film industry, know the revolutionary spirit of the new era in China, and know the greatness of the new China's future. This is our greatest hope, and it is also the greatest significance of "Secret Code" starting to meet with the people of the country.

### Xue Zhuobin Appointed Chief Engineer of the Dredging Bureau

Chadley Resigns

Chadley (British), the chief engineer of the Dredging Bureau, recently submitted his resignation to the director due to family affairs and returned to his country. He was approved to resign. The post of chief engineer has been succeeded by Xue Zhuobin (Wuxi native), the deputy chief engineer of the bureau. The handover is scheduled for today. Chadley has been dredging the Huangpu River for more than 30 years and has been managed by foreigners. This time, a Chinese engineer is appointed, which is a first. It is said that Mr. Xue graduated from the engineering department of a British university with a master's degree. When he was admitted to the bureau in the 18th year of the Republic of China, he was still an engineer of the Tianjin River and Sea. After being urged by the chief engineer, he resigned from his position and came to Shanghai for three years of internship. He has now been promoted to this position.

### Date of Phone Calls Between This City and Pingjin Not Yet Determined

Still Need to Continue Trying

Long-distance telephone calls between this city and various provinces and cities will also be popularized throughout the country. However, there are some places in North China and the southwestern border provinces where calls have not yet been made. According to news from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, long-distance telephone calls between this city and Pingjin have also begun to be tested. However, since the results of the test calls are not yet very satisfactory, more test calls are needed. The date of the official phone calls has not yet been determined.

### Cai Rongsheng's Home Robbery Case Rescheduled for Another Hearing

Cai Rongsheng's home at No. 12 Huade Road was suddenly entered by several robbers at 1:50 AM on the 12th of last month, who climbed over the wall and drew out their guns. They first threatened the maid Wang Yushi and robbed her of a pair of gold earrings. Then, they went upstairs and robbed the tenant Liu Chen of a gold ring, worth a total of twelve yuan. Cai woke up from his sleep and realized that it was a robbery, and blew the police whistle loudly. The robbers, fearing arrest, left a rope behind and fled in different directions. The next morning, Cai Rongsheng reported the situation to the Yulin Road Patrol Room. On the morning of the 25th, Detective Li Pengfei, together with a Western detective, arrested four suspects, Wang Zhaojin from Yixing, Wang Yansong from Jiangbei, Qiu Genquan and Shen Debiao, near Gaolang Bridge on Huade Road, and sent them to the First Special District Court for trial and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Bianfen presided over a continued trial in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin from the Patrol Room stated that the suspects Qiu Genquan and Shen Debiao were found to be innocent during the investigation and would not be prosecuted and released. The court approved it. He also said that the victim Liu Chen was frightened and moved away after the robbery and was not present. Cai Rongsheng claimed that he saw the defendant Wang Zhaojin at the scene. The maid Wang Yushi also testified that the defendant Wang Yansong was holding a flashlight and used a gun to threaten her and rob her of her gold earrings. Both defendants did not admit to the charges and asked for an identification. Judge Xiao ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for a further hearing in seven days.

### Police and Bailiffs Clash Over Document Inspection

An official lost his composure when his insignia was torn and he was slapped.

Lei Binzhang, a prosecutor from the Shanghai Local Court, arrived in Shanghai with his family from his native Hunan. They settled in an apartment on Cishi Road in the French Concession. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, he instructed Zhang Cheng, a bailiff from the court, to transport their luggage to the court. Two rickshaws were loaded. While passing the intersection of Huining Road and Tingxi Road in Nanshi (behind the court), a police officer numbered 3991 stopped them and demanded Zhang Cheng produce a transfer certificate. Zhang explained the situation, but the officer disbelieved him and grabbed Zhang Cheng's collar, tearing off his insignia with excessive force. Zhang Cheng argued, and was then slapped twice. He immediately went to the court to report the incident to the prosecutor for investigation.

### Kang Yuan Factory's Lawsuit Against Gu Qiushui Upheld

Kang Yuan Can Factory of this city sued Gu Qiushui, a former porcelain paper technician, for deliberately causing damage to a large amount of porcelain paper, resulting in losses of over 22,000 yuan. They filed a lawsuit against Gu Qiushui for compensation of damages according to their contract. The initial trial rejected the lawsuit. The factory felt the losses were too great and supplemented the lawsuit with three reasons, appealing to the Jiangsu High Third Branch Court. After several trials, the court ultimately ruled that the manufacture of porcelain paper was purely a technical matter, and the evidence was difficult to confirm. Therefore, the court yesterday upheld the original judgment.

### Apprentice Sentenced for Embezzlement in Cloth Shop Case

Zhu Xigen, the accountant of Huicheng Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 86 Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession, gave apprentice Li Genshan (19 years old, from Changzhou) 500 yuan in cash on the 11th of this month to deposit at Hongsheng Money Shop, along with a deposit book. He instructed Li to get a 200-yuan and a 600-yuan bank draft from Hengtong Money Shop. Unexpectedly, Li secretly forged a seal, withdrew 750 yuan in cash from Hengtong Money Shop, and fled with both the withdrawn money and the 500 yuan to be deposited. Zhu reported the incident to the French police, who sent detectives to search Li's luggage and found a photo of Li and a prostitute together. After investigation, the detectives arrested Li the next day at the Chunjiang Second Inn on Xixinqiao Street. They also seized a savings book with 1,100 yuan from Siming Bank and over 90 yuan in cash in room 406 of the Shenzhou Inn. All of these were considered stolen money and were handed over to the Special Court for investigation and detention. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Now, the French and Police Affairs Office has filed a public prosecution. After trial by Judge Sun Penghang, Li Genshan was sentenced yesterday for embezzlement of items held in the course of his duties, to two months of imprisonment; and for forging confidential documents, to two months of imprisonment, to be served consecutively for a total of four months.

Judge Zhong Qing presided over the Third Criminal Court yesterday and sentenced He Erzhen to five months imprisonment for continuous breach of trust, and six months imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of items held in the course of his duties, to be served concurrently for a total of seven months, with a two-year suspended sentence.

### Five Ties Lead to a Theft Case

Last December, Xinhua Mei Clothing Shop at No. 18 Xilin Road, Tangjiawan, South Shanghai, received floral fabric from Japanese businessman Hasegawa Shin Saburo (60 years old), president of Haoban, to make 90 dozen Western-style ties. After they were made and delivered, there was some leftover fabric, which was used to make several more ties. Jin Jinhuo from Shaoxing, residing at No. 39 Delanshi Lane, Zhongshipi Lane, inside the city, bought these ties from the clothing shop and resold them to Ren Lecai, a Xinwenxiang native, 50 years old, residing at No. 3 Liyuan Lane, Fangbang Road. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Ren was selling the ties near the Hongkou Xiaocai Market when Hasegawa Sada Saburo saw them and recognized them as his. He immediately reported to the police and Ren was arrested, with five ties seized. Ren claimed he bought them from someone named Jin.

### Paper Pulp Raw Materials Lacking, Waste Paper Prices Soar

Paper mills are absorbing as much as possible; no hope for paper prices to fall.

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, all countries around the world are increasing their military preparations and storing large quantities of raw materials for military industries. The soaring prices of metals are clear evidence of this. Wood pulp, a raw material for papermaking, is an essential ingredient for manufacturing gunpowder. Therefore, Central European countries such as Germany and Italy have been storing all available wood pulp since last year. At the same time, they are purchasing wood pulp raw materials from Northern European countries such as Finland. As Northern Europe and the Americas only export wood pulp, and other countries continue to store it non-stop, the raw materials are becoming increasingly scarce, and exports of wood pulp are decreasing. As a result, various paper prices are rising due to the lack of raw materials. Paper mills in China, such as Tianzhang in Shanghai, Minfeng in Jiaxing, Huasheng in Suzhou, Dahua in Hushuguan, and Huafeng in Hangzhou, all earned profits last year due to high paper prices. However, they rely entirely on foreign imports for wood pulp, the raw material for papermaking, and the costs are too high. They are feeling it is difficult to continue. They have changed their strategy and sent personnel to various places to absorb as much domestic papermaking raw materials as possible to reduce costs. Therefore, the market prices of waste cloth, paper scraps (cut-off paper edges and paper scraps), garbage paper, and ramie (used for cigarette paper) have increased dramatically. In two months, paper scraps have risen from 1.60 yuan to 5 yuan per picul, waste cloth has risen from 2 yuan to 5.20 yuan per picul, garbage paper has risen from 60 cents to 1.20 yuan per picul, and ramie has risen from 14 yuan to 30 yuan per picul. As a result, not only is there no hope of lower paper prices recently, but there is also a tendency for them to continue to rise.

### Convicted Robber Appeals, Awaiting Confrontation

Was Yang Ruiliang Shot by Pan? Hou and Wang Zhengji to be Confronted for Re-Verification

On January 21 of last year, at around 9:00 AM, the Yuanheng Money Shop at No. 130 Tianjin Road was suddenly invaded by several robbers. At that time, a customer of the shop, Liang Wenxi, bravely embraced one of the robbers. Another robber fired a gun at Liang, but accidentally hit another customer, Yang Ruiliang, in a vital area, killing him. The robbers, realizing they had caused a disaster, fled in a panic. Afterwards, Chinese and Western detectives from the General Patrol Room apprehended several robbers involved in the case, including Pan Huicheng, Wang Zhengji, Huang Aying, and Fang Quangui. They seized five pistols and more than 300 bullets, and handed them over to the First Special District Court. After the trial, it was determined that Yang Ruiliang was killed by Pan, so Pan was sentenced to death, and the other robbers were sentenced to more than ten years in prison. Pan appealed the verdict, arguing that Yang was not killed by him. He hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Jiang Yiping to appeal to the High Second Branch Court. His reasoning was that Liang Wenxi embraced a robber holding a weapon, and Pan stepped forward to take the weapon and fire it. The distance between Liang and Pan must have been close, so Liang would have been able to clearly identify him. However, Liang could not identify the person who killed Yang in the first trial, which clearly showed that another robber fired from a greater distance. This should be recognized. Based on various reasons, he proved that the person who fired and killed Yang Ruiliang was not the appellant, but someone else. He requested that the original judgment be revoked and replaced with a more appropriate ruling. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard by the High Second Branch Court's Criminal Division, presided over by Judge Yu Hua. Appellant Pan Huicheng testified that Wang Zhengji could prove who fired the shot. (According to reports, Wang is suffering from a serious illness and is being held in the Second Special Court's prison hospital due to another case.) Lawyer Chen immediately requested that the case be postponed to give the appellant an opportunity to confront Wang Zhengji. If, after the confrontation, he should still be held responsible for the murder, the appellant would die with his eyes closed. Furthermore, this case concerns the life and death of a person, and the implications are huge, so he requested permission to confront Wang to avoid any wrongful conviction. Lawyer Jin Jingxian from the Municipal Council also stated that the court could designate a date to escort the appellant Pan to the First Special Court's prison hospital to confront Wang Zhengji. The court reviewed the report and ordered that the case be adjourned for a retrial.

### Bad Check Used to Swindle a Gray Overcoat

A man and woman conspired and fled without a trace. They were caught by chance at the Great World and turned over to the police station.

Huang Yimin, a Cantonese man, 30 years old, and Wang Yubing, a Sichuan woman, 28 years old, lived together in room 12 of the Jing'an Villa Apartment No. 3, Jing'an Temple Road, this year. On the morning of February 16 of this year, they went together to Hongxiang Clothing Company on Nanjing Road to select a gray overcoat. The company originally priced it at 400 yuan, but Huang and Wang offered 200 yuan. Because the difference was hundreds of yuan, the deal was not made. Then, at noon, Huang and Wang went again.

After discussion,

they agreed on a price of 342 yuan. Huang and Wang instructed them to deliver the coat to their residence at 6:00 PM that evening. The company complied and sent an employee, Wang Feiyun, to deliver the coat. Huang paid with a check from Pudong Bank dated February 17. Because the bank's business hours had passed, it was impossible to verify the check, so they had to accept it. The company delivered the check to Shanghai Bank for collection. Unexpectedly, the check was

returned by Pudong Bank.

It was then discovered that Huang's deposit was only ten yuan. Hongxiang realized they had been swindled and went to Huang's residence to investigate. Unexpectedly, the two had already moved out on the evening of the 16th. They reported the incident to the police, but because the two were nowhere to be found, they could not be arrested. Until the 27th of the month, Xu Dazhang, an employee of Hongxiang Company, was driving near the Great World when he suddenly encountered Wang Yuqing. He immediately stopped the car and managed to

trick Wang into the car.

They drove directly to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Chief Ju Chengmo, Huang Yimin was arrested at Room 99, Yuanri Inn, Edward Road, and four pawn tickets were seized. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for investigation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Pan Zhenyang opened the Second Criminal Court for a continued hearing. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed charges of fraud, stating that a

black leather coat

had been found in the pawnshop based on the pawn tickets seized during the adjourned hearing. It was uncertain whether it was stolen property until the plaintiff identified it. The original stolen item in this case had not been recovered, so he requested that the case be adjourned. Next, a tea server from Apartment No. 1, Jing'an Villa, testified that the two defendants did live in Room 12 of the apartment he served. Both defendants denied defrauding Hongxiang Company of the gray overcoat and denied ever living in Apartment No. 3, Jing'an Villa. Judge Pan verified the testimonies and ordered that the case be adjourned for one week for a retrial.

### Extension of Opium Addiction License Renewal for Another Month

### Robbers in Dongxinqiao Street Robbery Case Sentenced

Tian Linchang and Others Each Sentenced to Seven Years

Robbers Tian Linchang, Wang Acai, Yang Changgen (nicknamed Gao Bitou Changgen), all from Ningbo, robbed the Jiang Wang family's property at No. 4 Shoulu Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, on September 9 of last year, and fled. Recently, they were arrested for committing robbery in the International Settlement. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for prosecution. Tian and Wang were each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, and Yang was sentenced to seven years and six months of imprisonment.

### A Court Case Arises from Two Young Couples

Denial in Court, but Confessions in Police Records

Xu Yuanrong (age 20), a native of Rugao and nephew of the owner of the Gongtai Land and Goods Company on Guangfu Road, north of Caoyang Road in western Shanghai, and Shen Jian (age 19), a local resident of No. 12, Jinjiazhai, Beixin Jing, were schoolmates. Xu Yuanrong, having been neighbors with Zhang Tingzhen, became acquainted with his daughter, Zhang Xiaomao (age 17). Xiaomao introduced him to Zhang Xiuying (age 16), daughter of police officer Zhang Shuangjiu. On December 28th of the previous year, Xu, Shen, and others invited Xiaomao and Xiuying to play in Zhaofeng Park and then to see a play. They then lured them to a hotel near the Great World, where Xu Yuanrong had intercourse with Xiaomao, and Shen Jian had intercourse with Xiuying, for two nights. They also planned to take them to the countryside to imprison them. Zhang Tingzhen and Zhang Bianyuan inquired about their whereabouts from Xu Yuanrong's uncle, Xu Jianliang, who then released Xiaomao and Xiuying. Xiuying returned home, but disappeared again two days later. Zhang Bianyuan then reported the whole story to the local court. After questioning the defendants, Prosecutor Li Fen of the court found that they denied having jointly seduced Zhang Xiaomao and Xiuying. However, an investigation of the original records of the Caoyang Road Police Station revealed that Zhang Xiuying and Zhang Xiaomao had already confessed the previous events at that branch. Shen Jian also admitted that he and Xu Yuanrong had accompanied Zhang Xiaomao and Zhang Xiuying to Zhaofeng Park, and stated that Xiaomao was Xu's girlfriend, etc. Therefore, it was deemed that the case was clear, and a public prosecution was initiated. Yesterday, Judge Chen held a hearing. The defendants hired lawyer Liu Xiang to defend them, arguing that the plaintiffs' statements were inconsistent, that the plaintiff was a police officer, that Xiuying was an adopted daughter, and that he deliberately used his adopted daughter as a sacrificial lamb to frame young men in order to extort money. The hotel was just an empty claim, and investigations revealed that Xiuying had registered to work at the Huadong Rubber Factory in Fanwangdu last year, claiming to be 22 years old, so there was no guilt. The court ordered the conclusion of the debate and awaited judgment.

### Four Passengers Detained on Shanghai-Beiping Train

### Hot Water Bottle Industry Association Cables Request to Revoke Consular Jurisdiction

The Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating: "To Minister Wang of the Nanjing National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with utmost respect. We believe that the unification of judicial power is a necessary element for an independent nation. Since the late Qing Dynasty, China has been repeatedly subjected to foreign insults, and the Treaty of Tianjin stipulated the right of consular jurisdiction. At that time, Chinese and foreign laws and customs differed, so foreign countries could still use the excuse of protecting overseas Chinese. Subsequently, many abuses arose. This so-called consular jurisdiction has become a shield for unscrupulous foreigners to commit crimes and do whatever they want. Our country's judiciary has no right to interfere. For decades, not only has society and people's livelihood suffered deeply, but the loss of our legal rights and the humiliation of our national system are the greatest. Thinking of this, we are extremely saddened. Now, the great cause of China's unification has been completed, and the judicial system is becoming increasingly perfect, with facts proving that the excuse of poor judicial habits and different customs no longer exists. You, Minister, are a leading figure in world jurisprudence, familiar with international politics and versed in Chinese and foreign legal principles. The revocation of foreign consular jurisdiction in China is undoubtedly within your grasp. We implore you to follow Premier Sun's instructions and act decisively to restore national rights and redress the people's humiliation. We present our sincere words with utmost respect and anticipation. Zhang Qingfa, Chairman of the Shanghai Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association, and Supervisory Committee members Gan Dounan and Meng Haoji, etc., respectfully salute."

### Commemorating "May First"

— Lu Jingshi

Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the Chinese national rejuvenation movement has gone through many twists and turns and taken a lot of effort to achieve today's results. The true unification of the country has been completed, and the clarification of politics, the development of the economy, and the progress and promotion of cultural undertakings are also underway, showing a new atmosphere. The national strength has indeed been strengthened compared to before, and the international status has also been raised compared to before. These facts are indeed worthy of the nation's praise. However, the national rejuvenation movement still has a long way to go and cannot be complacent. In the future, it will depend on the people of the country to continue to work hard for the nation and the country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, with one heart and one mind, to create a new China. This responsibility is borne most heavily by our laborers. The foundation of national construction is based on economic construction, and in the process of economic construction, the hard work of the laborers is the greatest driving force. This is something that our laborers must deeply recognize.

At the Third Plenary Session of this year, the government made an overall decision on the plan for developing the national economy, which is now being implemented. At the same time, it is determined to earnestly cherish and support those national industries that have been struggling and have achieved results, in order to promote their growth and prosperity and promote economic prosperity. When the government began to implement this great plan, it earnestly instructed the people of the country, hoping that they would cooperate to achieve success. It particularly emphasized the coordination of labor and management, repeatedly stating that it was determined to eradicate the ideology of class struggle and establish the spirit of labor-management cooperation, and to seek the expansion of production and the improvement of labor's living conditions in a peaceful and rational manner. Disputes not only cause losses to both labor and management, but also affect social security, damage national vitality, and hinder the advancement of the national economy. These facts are obvious to all. Anyone in our country who has a little knowledge of protecting the nation and the people should absolutely avoid illegal actions that could cause labor-management disputes, and follow the government's orders. If so, labor unrest can be quelled.

In recent months, labor unrest has been surging in Shanghai. The most important industries affected include silk weaving, cotton spinning, tram, and automobile. Some disputes have been caused by employers dismissing workers, while others have been caused by labor demanding improved treatment. Strikes and work slowdowns have occurred frequently, and labor and management have gone to extremes, making it difficult to resolve the issues. The labor unrest in the silk weaving industry is particularly serious. Workers demanding improved treatment due to rising prices is understandable, but resorting to strikes and work slowdowns as a means of coercion is a big mistake. As for the employers' insistence on one-sided views and their failure to accept the government's mediation decisions, their blame cannot be shirked either. Both sides have made mistakes, resulting in a major error. The basis of this error lies in the failure to deeply recognize the true meaning of labor-management coordination, and the ignorance of the law, or the failure to abide by the law despite knowing it, and the lack of respect for the government's opinions. This is what labor and national capitalists should deeply regret today.

Today, as we commemorate May First Labor Day, we should correct past mistakes and consider the interests of the entire nation and the country. We cannot be obsessed with our own interests. Capitalists should consider the lives of workers, and labor should work as hard as possible. Labor and management should understand, help, and cooperate with each other, and under the guidance of the government, cooperate effectively to develop production, complete economic construction, bring the country to a prosperous state, and promote national rejuvenation.

### Reflections on "May 1st World Labor Day"

— Zhou Xuexiang

In 1878, workers in Chicago, USA, launched a "three-eight system" to improve treatment, which quickly spread like wildfire to European and American countries. In 1886, May 1st was established as World Labor Day to commemorate the struggle of our workers. "As we remember the past achievements of the labor movement, look at the current environment of workers around the world, and the future trends, we cannot help but feel infinitely emotional and terrified. At that time, the use of machinery in European countries had not yet reached its full potential. Now, production methods are universally replacing manual labor with machinery, and the fear of worker unemployment permeates the world. Government plans to help the unemployed in various countries have become a few pieces of empty talk, and the need for the implementation of the "three-eight system" is of course felt urgently.

Looking back at the situation of our country's workers? It is not comparable to Europe and America. The stagnation of national industries, the underdevelopment of industry, and the production methods still cannot break away from manual labor. The inevitable result is the phenomenon of "too many people, not enough jobs". To talk about the implementation of the "three-eight system" to liberate our workers from their suffering is like scratching an itch from the outside of a boot, and is not the right medicine for our needs. The annual trade deficit and the influx of foreign goods into the interior like a tide strike a serious blow to the budding national industry. Rural bankruptcy, capital outflow, and unemployed masses all come to the cities to find work to solve their living problems. With too many monks and too little porridge, the serious unemployment situation is further aggravated. The low wages paid, in order to maintain a minimum standard of living, require the extension of daily working hours. The inability to fully utilize machinery and the lack of cooperation between production and sales make it impossible for products to compete with foreign products. This is indeed the difficult situation facing the industry before the Party. However, how can we solve the suffering of our workers? In the era of national unified construction, there are two kinds of problems that need to be solved urgently "internally" and "externally", which need the full attention and effort of the people of the country.

Domestically: Develop and promote the production of heavy industry. All national defense equipment should be self-sufficient as a prerequisite. Control the production and sales of light industry, use new machinery for mass production to replace the dumping of foreign products, step up production, and strengthen the national economic strength to achieve the purpose of saving the country through production.

Externally: Abolish unequal treaties, establish complete tariff autonomy, build tariff barriers, and exclude foreign goods from overstepping their role, especially smuggling in North China. If it is allowed to continue, it will not only destroy our country's industry, but also lead to the death of our country's economy.

In the 20th century today, the fate of all countries depends on the degree of development of their national capital, industry, and industry. Our workers are the commandoes on the front lines of national salvation through production and economic national defense. How should we bury our heads and work hard, enduring the groans of our suffering, hoping that labor and management can fully coordinate and cooperate under the mission of the national economic construction movement, sacrifice everything, take into account the minimum living needs of workers, and fight a life-and-death battle with imperialism on the economic front to determine the fate of our workers to be free from suffering!

### A Nation of Scenic Spots

— Chen Fu

China has three sources of pride: First, its vast territory and abundant resources; second, its early civilization; and third, its beautiful scenery, unparalleled in the world.

These are all true, of course. However, even a vast territory cannot withstand the "yielding" of four provinces in one night. Yielding once or twice, it will all be yielded away. So the first point is no longer often mentioned. Only the second and third points are still boasted about and promoted. The expression of the former is the relocation of antiquities and the preservation of historical sites. As for the latter, three years ago, before the antiquities had been moved, there was news in Beiping that the "City of Culture" would be turned into a "Scenic Area."

Now it is spring, and the railroads are running tourist trains, and newspapers are publishing news of wealthy people and celebrities touring in the spring. Scenic spots are crowded with ladies and gentlemen. China is indeed a nation of culture, and the Chinese people are indeed an elegant people!

Lushan and Qingdao, where important people go to recuperate and escape the summer heat, and Hangzhou and Suzhou, which are frequented by Chinese and foreign tourists, are famous throughout the world, and need not be mentioned. Famous recluses, visiting mountains and worshipping Buddhas, and cultivating themselves in the deep forests, are all engaged in major repairs everywhere, and the scenery is becoming more and more spectacular. Even in remote rural areas, there are always a few celebrities who rack their brains to come up with names like "Lingering Snow on the East Mountain" and "Sunset on the West River" to compile "Ten Views." Wealthy people build villas, pavilions, and towers, pursuing luxury to the extreme. Rich people build tombs, with jade railings and carved columns, and even the dead must lie in famous mountains and scenic spots. And these villas and these tombs, passed down to future generations, become various kinds of scenic spots and historical sites—our culture!

Moreover, in a land of beautiful mountains and clear waters, blessed with spiritual energy, beautiful women can be produced. Xi Shi served Wu, and Goujian was able to restore his country. Until two years ago, some people still hoped that Xi Shi would be reborn to revive the Chinese nation. Sai Jinhua's "insulting the national system" has already become a major discovery this year.

If the territory changes color, what shall we do? This does not matter. Because although the country's rivers and mountains are broken, the scenery will not change. In the Suzhou landscape postcards, the Japanese consulate in the Japanese concession is listed as one of the local "scenic spots." Shanghai's modern literati, after going to dance halls, drinking coffee, and taking their lovers for a walk on Avenue Joffre, can still write famous articles praising the "moving" "exotic atmosphere." It doesn't matter, the scenery will definitely become more numerous in the future, and there is no need to travel overseas. Eastern and Western "exotic atmosphere" will all be transported to China, so that our celebrities can tour and admire them!

### Go Away! Spring

— Ge Yi

Spring, what have you brought us? Here, the days are filled with gloomy skies, bitter winds and cold rain, the humid air suffocates us, and not a single ray of warm sunlight warms our chilled hearts! Over there, you burn with the poison of drought, you cause a group of pitiful people to destroy their families, burying their own children! You turn the fields back to wilderness, and the seedlings into dry straw! You seem to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the white bones and wailing by the roadside, quietly abandoning this tragic scene and leaving on your own.

The flowers that bloom under your oppressive force have a fleeting youth. Before they can enjoy their deserved splendor, you greedily, cruelly, and jealously ravage them: just like a young girl whose youth is violated by a powerful and wicked demon! Now, they watch as fragments of their youth fall, irretrievably buried in the mud, leaving behind a hunched body waiting to wither, bearing only the bitter fruit of self-pity. They weep, moan, and lament the loss of their most precious youth all day long—yet you leave selfishly, without a hint of compassion!

Spring, cursed spring, what have you brought us!

Before, I welcomed your arrival with a heart expecting a miracle, hoping to find my lost springtime in the bright wilderness amid your glory, believing that your tenderness could warm the soul of the earth! Alas! Now, I only return with greater disappointment, wearily dragging my mud-caked, bleeding feet! What I retain is an even older, grayer gloom!

Ah, spring, you are a messenger who has fallen into another world. Only those people in that world of red, orange, and green, accompanied by carnal pleasures, bless your coming and grieve your departure. But, spring, what else do you bring them? …

Go: go! You, this spring! We will no longer welcome you, nor will we feel sad to see you go!

We have a summer coming that is full of passion, vigor, and holds a storm within.

### Farewell Spring, Welcome Summer

— Mo Xi

If this piece of writing reaches readers, it should be in May. May is the transition into summer, so I can't help but feel a sense of loss at the silent departure of spring. As the saying goes, "The plan for the year lies in spring," and people always place their greatest hopes on spring. However, this year's spring seems to have been spent in bitter winds and bleak rains, and there was even a spring snow that "harmed the flowers and grains." The only thing that can barely embellish the spring scenery is a few spring outing advertisements from travel agencies, but these are met with indifference by the general public. After all, travel does not belong to everyone, even though everyone knows that spring is the season for travel. I have read many pieces of writing in which people planned a meaningful trip, but ultimately, from destinations such as Beijing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou, they only hoped to steal a day of leisure for an excursion to Kunshan or Nanxiang, and in the end, they couldn't even set foot on the lawns of Zhaofeng Park or the Bund Park. When I read these writings, I initially found them laughable. The foundation of travel is built on economics and time, and people busy with life naturally cannot allow their energy to stray even slightly from bread. Planning a meaningful trip is truly an extravagant hope. However, if you yourself have had such plans, then you shouldn't laugh at the author for overestimating their abilities, but rather sympathize with their emotional outpouring in writing. In such a narrow living environment, when have we ever seen an evergreen tree!

May is the transition into summer. After the Awakening of Insects, all kinds of insects stir, and summer may be an even more active season. In the future, there will be no more of the lingering, oppressive weather of spring rain, but rather the prelude to a thunderous rain that will refresh people's spirits. May is also "Revolution Day," and "the military police organs in the Shanghai International Settlement, in order to maintain public order, will, as usual, implement full-month security measures from May 1st, strictly prohibiting petitions, strikes, and illegal gatherings and demonstrations." Therefore, I am reminded that May is also a "month of shame," as countless young lives were sacrificed in this early summer month in exchange for this page of bloody history. At the same time, this page of bloody history, without waiting for us to "avenge" it, has forcibly diluted the impressions left in your mind. It is said that our maps cannot appear in movies, which is clear evidence of this.

In our ancient sayings, May is also a "poisonous month," and all kinds of "five poisons" and "demons" will appear during this month. This symbolic prediction coincides with both ancient and modern times. Therefore, May should be even more valued than the passing spring. "Plans" that were not realized in the spring should be left for the summer. We should be happy that we are living through another summer because, in the spring of next year, we may be able to take a meaningful trip to a place even farther than Beijing.

### Odes to Smoke

— Xu Ji

A quiet, chilly spring night, deathly still, as rich as fine wine, one is immersed in it, feeling the world's boundless vastness, time's infinite duration. From ancient times to the present, it is as if there is an endless, desolate wilderness with nothing to lean on. In the distance, some sparks of fire are wriggling, leaping up, and falling down, and thus, what is high is the yellow earth of tombs, and what is scattered is the withered bones of past lives, only the "I" within the heart, represents this fleeting "now": however, being oppressed by that endless vastness and duration, it is as if like a sponge soaked with water, squeezing, squeezing, finally shrinking into a ball, feeling one's infinite insignificance in the vast wilderness.

That wilderness, is the darkness of night—in the darkness, there is no lamp lit.

I think of some past people and things: these

## Page 24

people, these things, there was a time when they were "real," but time has washed them away again and again, and now they have only become illusions…

I can't endure it any longer, in the darkness, I am either falling into a mud pit from which I can never recover, or going insane.

I light a cigarette, take a few heavy puffs, and sparks of ash fly before my eyes—at this moment, I see the bright light—that light is red and beautiful, seizing a patch of darkness from the flickering flames, I rejoice wildly, I feel sacred and grateful joy! I let this small cigarette constantly breathe flames before my eyes, like a person, like a person with character!

Humans, shining, breathing out fiery breaths! I remembered: the mottled marks branded on history, golden, blood red—they burned away the darkness inch by inch——but I can't bear to think any more: isn't that life? Life, glorious life, while emitting light, they turned into ashes!—They threw themselves as fuel for human progress, as fuel for the enlightened part of history!

So, I take a heavy puff of the cigarette, let its flying sparks be accompanied by dense strands of smoke, drifting in the dark sky, going away, disappearing, and the ashes left on the cigarette butt, carry a leaping posture.

It seems that there is again a vast world—this time, I am walking, and seeing passersby, growing up in anxiety, laughing, crying, rejoicing, grieving... finally, wearing a head of white hair, silently falling into the earth...

And people are singing a tragic song:

"Burn yourself,

Burn yourself,

Even if it is a moment of burning and shining,

What is left is brilliant ashes!"

The world of humanity, therefore, will one day bloom with splendid flowers, and those dead souls will be silently buried in the earth, their withered bones as pale as ashes.

Walking forward, for thousands of years, tens of thousands of years, just like a cigarette in the darkness, being breathed in by people, emitting reddish-golden flames in the dark sky, people look at it, get a trace of warmth, and it seems like a heater is lit in their hearts, so, they breathe in, letting the ashes erode this small body.

(The cigarette, when it burns one's fingers, that small body has already reached its end, the ashes fall in dots on the ground, the sparks of fire on the cigarette butt still flicker with weak smoke.)

I startled, realizing that the cigarette had become ashes, just like an old warrior, finding his gray white hair by the stream. Is it over? Is it over? Is that how it ends?

However, I will not forget: even though that small body had once shone brightly, and now, the ashes in front of me reveal a tragic yet "proud" expression, yes, "proud" is the appropriate word, because that small cigarette did not disgrace its life.

Life! I dare not think any more. Behind the beautiful sparks are ashes. People light up their lives, and then, mottled white hair covers their heads, it tells you: "Only a little bit of the stem of life remains."

Be sad, be grieved, but people must ultimately return to the soil, "From the soil you came, and to the soil you shall return!" Just as a burnt cigarette butt must be thrown on the ground, trampled on, people forget about them………

In the darkness, I also throw away my cigarette butt, but I keep thinking about some familiar dead souls, as if they are standing in front of me intimately and terrifyingly, proclaiming something to me:

"We are the ones who flashed the sparks of life!"

I trembled………

### Melancholy (with picture)

— Ping Zi

Outside the window, there is always a gloomy sky, and rain threads beat on the glass window in a persistent manner. Occasionally, a few minutes of faint sunlight slip into the room, but without a cigarette, one can hear the children in the alley shouting, the sound of rain.

After being abused by a severe winter, everyone hopes that spring will arrive soon; spring is a great season of the year! This year, this hope has been dashed. The calendar has already been torn through April, and it is the scenery of late spring. I still have no way to take off my cotton robe, and I suspect that spring is stagnating somewhere.

I myself admit that I am a person with "spring sickness," always longing for and worrying about spring; every year, I always yearn for the quick arrival of spring, because I feel that it can illuminate my gentle and comfortable mood. The smile of the spring mountains, the dance of the purple and red flowers, the clear song of the yellow orioles, are all enough to make me fall deeply drunk, drunk in their embrace. I am even more deeply in love with the glimmer of the moonlight boat trip on West Lake, the flock of white geese swimming gracefully on the banks of the Fuchun River, and the fragrant water plants on the green sandy isles, and the spring bamboo shoots sprouting in the green bamboo groves of my hometown. I also want to transform into a swallow, traveling all over the world, pointing to the green mountains and green waters, and saying that is my home. I have never revealed a trace of unhappiness to anyone, spoiling people's spring mood. Because my mood only feels gentle, only feels comfortable.

But this year, the ruthless east wind has made me too melancholy! When I walked into the suburbs braving the rain, the willow branches were full of tears, the green mountains were shrouded in heavy rain and fog, what about the dance of the purple and red flowers? What about the clear song of the orioles?… Ah! I sighed.
