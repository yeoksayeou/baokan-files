### Japanese Troops in Shanghai First Provoked Our Army's Resistance Yesterday Morning, Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses

Japanese Troops Provoked First, Mayor Yu Protests; We Occupied Baziqiao, Zhongxing Road Bridge, etc.; Enemy Withdraws from Western Shanghai and Concentrates Forces in Yangshupu; Loud Cannon Fire After 2:30 AM This Morning

Since the North China Incident, the Japanese military has dispatched a large number of warships, carrying naval and army soldiers to Shanghai, causing the situation in Shanghai to suddenly become serious. Although the consular corps stationed in Shanghai has been mediating for days, it has yielded little effect. Our security forces and patriotic soldiers, due to various violations of the agreements by the Japanese side, have reached the limit of their tolerance. For the sake of self-defense, they have also made considerable preparations, harboring the determination to perish together with the nation, to strike back at those who strike. However, the warlike Japanese militarists remain obstinate and suddenly provoked our army first at 9:10 AM yesterday. The promise given by the Japanese side to the consular corps not to provoke first was once again broken by the Japanese side. Our army then retaliated. The battle situation is recorded as follows:

Japanese Troops Provoked First Yesterday Morning

Approximately seven to eight thousand Japanese marines, fully armed, marched out of the Japanese Primary School on North Sichuan Road at 9:15 AM yesterday morning. They swept our troops with light machine guns at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Yokohama Bridge, attempting to cross the Songhu Railway and rush towards Baoshan Road. Our garrison police and security forces immediately launched a fierce counterattack. After about fifteen minutes, the Japanese troops could not withstand and retreated.

Mayor Yu Files a Serious Protest

After the conflict occurred, Mayor Yu immediately telephoned Japanese Consul General Okamoto. Unable to get through easily, he formally submitted a serious written protest, and sent the protest letter to the leader of the consular corps stationed in Shanghai, Norwegian Consul General Aal, to inform the consuls general of various countries. ⑴ The original text of the protest letter to Japan stated, "Sir, regarding the recent actions of your country's navy assembling in Shanghai to threaten our country, this mayor has filed a serious protest with your consul general. To maintain peace and order in this city, this mayor agreed with your consul general that neither side should lightly initiate hostilities. This matter was fully heard by the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy at a joint committee meeting yesterday (12th), and they can testify to it. Yet, the words were barely out of our mouths when your marines suddenly charged into the area within the alert line in the northern district of this city at 9:15 AM today, attacking our defending troops. After our troops resisted calmly, because our side did not want the situation to escalate, we only drove back the troops who provoked hostilities and did not pursue them. The conflict soon stopped. This mayor believes that this action by your marines is sufficient to endanger peace and disrupt order. Accordingly, I lodge a protest and request that you investigate and inform your country's naval authorities to respect their promises and strictly restrain them. Respectfully addressed to Japanese Consul General Okamoto in Shanghai." ⑵ The letter to Aal stated, "Sir, I am enclosing a copy of the protest letter that this mayor is sending to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai regarding the Japanese side's violation of its promises and light initiation of hostilities this morning. I am sending this along with the draft of the protest letter for your review and request that you inform the consuls general of various countries stationed in Shanghai for their information. Respectfully addressed to Norwegian Consul General and Leader of the Consular Corps in Shanghai, Aal."

Continuous Conflicts on Tiantong'an Road

At noon, Japanese troops dispatched a large contingent from behind the Japanese headquarters on Jiangwan Road, crossing the train passage at Tiantong'an Station, and attacked our alert line at Baziqiao on Tiantong'an Road. They were eventually repelled by our defending soldiers. At the same time, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers advanced from the south of Fenshui Temple, crossed Linping Road Bridge, and entered the area of Wuhua Road on Linping Road. The Linping Road branch of the police station reported that the police on duty at the outpost had rushed back to report. The chief of the branch station urgently led a team of forty to fifty police officers to engage in battle. There were also minor conflicts in several other places.

Simultaneous Launching of Attacks in Zhabei

At around 3:00 PM, battles successively began in the areas near Yinxiang Township, Jiangwan Road, Baziqiao, Qingyun Bridge, and Yokohama Bridge. Both sides seemed to be using small cannons and mortars to attack each other. However, the sound of cannons was not very frequent, so the situation was not very intense.

Cannon Fire Clearly Heard North of Suzhou Creek

After 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Zhabei area briefly returned to calm. However, before 6:00 PM, the sound of cannons resumed, with a shot fired approximately every one or two minutes. Based on the distance of the sound waves, all shots were fired by the Japanese army, and our side also occasionally retaliated. The north of Suzhou Creek could be clearly heard. At 7:27 PM, the electric lights in the Baoshan Road and North Station areas suddenly went out, but the sound of cannons continued uninterrupted. What made our reporter most gratified at the time was that the impoverished people who had fled from the Zhabei area into the public concession, although they were sleeping in the streets and under the eaves, suffering the pain of being displaced, all expressed extreme excitement and joy upon hearing the news of our army's determination to resist, which was evident on their faces. This is sufficient to show that all citizens of the Republic of China hold the same determination to fight the enemy, with no one willing to coexist with them.

Shells Hit Japanese Headquarters at 4:00 PM

Around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, faint cannon fire was heard three or four times in the northern district of the public concession, presumably the Japanese army fired the first shots as a threat. Then at 4:00 PM, they launched a full-scale bombardment, and the great battle officially began. The area near the Commercial Press on Baoxing Road caught fire after being hit by shells. Our fire brigade immediately responded and extinguished the fire in about an hour. At the same time, our side also retaliated with heavy artillery, targeting the Japanese headquarters on Jiangwan Road. The shells hit the back of the headquarters. Around 7:00 PM, the sound of cannons became more intense and could be clearly counted. Our troops were in high spirits, all fighting fearlessly and vying to kill the enemy. Fierce fighting is currently continuing. Casualties and losses on both sides are still under investigation.

Our Troops Approach the Enemy Headquarters

According to the Central News Agency, the front line, which had temporarily subsided around 9:00 PM, resumed cannon fire at 11:30 PM, but with shots fired every three to five minutes, the fighting was not very intense. Our troops on Jiangwan Road advanced and are now only 1,000 meters away from the enemy's Marine Corps headquarters. The enemy's situation is quite critical. More than 200 Japanese troops stationed in the Taya Brewery are likely to be captured. In the Yinxiang Port area, our troops also have the upper hand and are advancing rapidly. The distance between them and the enemy headquarters at the No. 1 Cotton Mill of the Public University can be reached by rifle fire.

We Defeated the Japanese Troops at Baziqiao

The great battle broke out at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and the sound of cannons continued until about 7:00 PM when it temporarily stopped. The Japanese troops were mainly based in the area of Baziqiao and Zhongyu Road, which was originally outside our defensive line, as we used it to lure the enemy. After about 4:00 PM, all the Japanese troops were defeated by us, and the Japanese troops retreated under the cover of heavy artillery.

According to the Central News Agency, in the Baziqiao area, our troops bravely charged under the enemy's intensive artillery fire, and the enemy collapsed and retreated. At 5:30 PM, they advanced to the enemy's position and occupied Baziqiao. They then tracked and pursued, occupying the Zhongxing Road Bridge. At the same time, in the Jiangwan Road area, our troops used artillery to bombard the enemy's Marine Corps headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. Two shells landed near the enemy's headquarters, and it was reported that the enemy suffered considerable losses. According to unverified news, the enemy's headquarters at the Public University Cotton Mill was also hit by a shell.

Japanese Soldiers Charged Suddenly but Could Not Withstand and Fled

At around 9:10 AM yesterday morning, about thirty to forty Japanese marines, led by Japanese plainclothes agents, suddenly charged towards our positions on Tiantong'an Road and Jiangwan Road. As they were about to enter Baoshan Road, the Japanese plainclothes agents opened fire first, followed by the marines with their rifles. The soldiers stationed there immediately responded calmly and swept with machine guns, knocking down more than a dozen Japanese plainclothes agents and marines who were the first to charge. The other enemy soldiers could not withstand and fled back. In total, the battle lasted for about twenty minutes before stopping. Our army suffered no losses, and the position was consolidated, prepared for any eventuality. At around 10:30 AM, the Japanese soldiers, seeing that the sneak attack on Tiantong'an Road had failed and resulted in losses, changed their direction and launched another attack on the Dongbaoxing Road area, with two armored vehicles as cover. This was spotted by our sentry, who opened fire. Our soldiers, who were lying in ambush there, immediately came out to meet the enemy. The Japanese soldiers fired haphazardly along the way and were again killed five or six and seriously wounded six or seven by our army. Seeing that the situation was unsustainable, the Japanese soldiers retreated immediately. In this battle, one of our soldiers was wounded.

Japanese Soldiers Killed, Japanese Women Moved to Avoid Danger

At around 3:50 PM in the afternoon, the Japanese army began to use artillery and mortars as cover, and Japanese soldiers launched a fierce attack on our army's positions at East Sports Road, Qingyun Bridge, Zhongxing Road Bridge, Baziqiao, etc. Our army waited calmly and retaliated with mortars and machine guns, causing a dense barrage of gunfire. The Japanese plainclothes agents also went out to disrupt, attempting to set fires and disturb our army's morale. However, our army's morale was as firm as iron, our attitude was calm, and our arrangements were tight, so the Japanese soldiers had no chance to take advantage and were at a loss, suffering heavy losses on the spot. More than twenty Japanese soldiers were killed on the spot. After about twenty-five minutes, the Japanese soldiers were again unable to withstand and retreated, and the gunfire gradually subsided, but the artillery bombardment did not stop. In this battle, our artillery team hit the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters on Jiangwan Road three times, destroying the buildings and walls of the headquarters, posing a considerable threat to the Japanese army. As a result, Japanese residents at the end of North Sichuan Road were panicked. All one hundred thirty to forty women were transported by three transport vehicles from North Sichuan Road to the relief center set up by the Japanese at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Hankou Road for temporary shelter at about 10:00 PM last night. At the same time, the Fukumin Hospital, the headquarters for rescuing wounded Japanese soldiers at the end of North Sichuan Road, was also moved to the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund yesterday afternoon, and five military vehicles carrying wounded Japanese soldiers were sent to the hospital around 11:00 PM. From this, it can be seen the status of the Japanese soldiers' deaths and injuries as of 10 PM yesterday.

Japanese Warships Opened Fire to Cover the Right Flank

At 6:00 PM, Japanese warships stationed in Wusong and Gaoqiao fired heavy artillery at the line from Qiujiang Wharf to Shanghai University, and it was reported that Shanghai University was slightly damaged. The purpose was to test our army's defensive strength and attempt to cover the enemy's advance from the right flank. Our army knew their intention and responded calmly. The enemy warships fired about eight or nine shots and then stopped. The fighting in the Jiangwan Road area also temporarily ceased around 9:00 PM.

Three Japanese Warships Suddenly Left Shanghai Yesterday

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, a large number of munitions transported by Japanese warships have been unloaded at the Huangpu and Osaka wharves. Chinese coolies at the wharves have automatically left the wharves and refused to unload the goods. The Japanese warships had no choice but to send the remaining marines to carry the goods themselves. Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese warships Sumida, Katata, and Kure, all small warships with extremely shallow drafts in the Yangtze River, suddenly left Shanghai and sailed out of Wusong. Their whereabouts are top secret.

Japanese Soldiers Landed from the Fish Market

At about 7:10 PM, two Japanese warships approached the Fish Market pier, and two to three hundred marines landed. When the staff and workers of the Fish Market, about 300 people, saw that the situation was not good, they took boats in batches to Donggou in Pudong to take refuge.

Japanese Troops Abandoned the Shanghai West Cotton Mill

About three or four hundred Japanese troops originally stationed at the Toyota Cotton Mill on Zhongshan Road in Shanghai West began to withdraw in batches in more than a dozen trucks from 5:00 PM yesterday. All the large quantities of munitions were also transported away at the same time, which lasted until about 7:00 PM. The Japanese troops at the Tongxing and Rihua Cotton Mills on Gordon Road and Yichang Road are also scheduled to withdraw completely this morning.

Our Army Takes a Large Encirclement Formation

According to reports from our army's front line, our army has advanced on all fronts since the beginning of the engagement with the enemy troops. The lines of Baziqiao, Fangjia Muqiao, and Jiangwan Yinxiang Township have all advanced by several hundred meters or one or two Chinese miles, and are taking a large encirclement formation against the enemy troops.

Japanese Men Join the Plainclothes Teams

Since the Japanese army began to provoke and the two sides engaged in preliminary skirmishes, all Japanese men who have not returned to Japan have reportedly been incorporated into the plainclothes teams. In addition to serving as spies and disrupting rear operations, they also appear in groups of twenty or thirty, armed with knives and guns, in the Hongkou area and various parts of the concession. However, those in the Hongkou area have more obvious markings than those in other areas. It is hoped that the people will pay attention to this.

Our Troops Have Abundant Strength

After the outbreak of the Japanese invasion, in addition to the security forces, our resistance forces have also been reinforced by divisions such as x×, which are rich in combat experience. The strength is extremely abundant and will definitely give the invaders a serious blow. It is reported that the Japanese air force will be dispatched today, and our army has made full preparations for this and will also inflict heavy damage on the enemy.

Shanghai University Faculty and Staff Have Escaped

After the outbreak of the battle yesterday, more than one hundred Chinese and American faculty and staff members and their families at Shanghai University were all on campus. Due to the intense artillery fire, they took refuge in the underground cellar for several hours. At about 9:00 PM, they escaped from the position and were surrounded and searched by Japanese troops at the Public University Cotton Mill. They were all released and safely arrived in the concession, where they are temporarily staying at the school's Business School on Museum Road.

Wusong is Peaceful, Japanese Gunboats Moored

Wusong remained quiet yesterday. Our army has made serious preparations. Local agencies are jointly operating on Guizhi Road to facilitate contacts between all parties. The Shanghai-Wusong train service was temporarily suspended at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. The city ferry only operated to Gaoqiao after 12:00 PM yesterday, so the water and land transportation between Shanghai and Wusong was completely blocked. The Wusong Zhang Huabang Railway Factory Wharf was burned by our side yesterday to prevent Japanese troops from launching a sneak attack. When the reporter hired a small boat to leave Wusong for Shanghai at about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, he saw a Japanese shallow-water gunboat moored in the Zhang Huabang Wanpu River, and another one moored near Gaoqiao. The gun covers had been removed, and the guards were using telescopes to scout incoming ships.

On-the-Spot Investigation of the Situation at the Boundary

Last night from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM, the sound of cannons was denser and the battle was still fierce. After 9:30 PM, it seemed to be in a state of rest. The reporter of this newspaper went to various places north of Suzhou Creek for inspection at about 10:00 PM. At the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, no fewer than one hundred residents were lingering and watching. At the Target Road intersection, there were posts of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession, the iron gates were tightly closed, and Baoshan Road was a dark world in the distance. At about 11:30 PM, one or two cannon shots and the sound of machine guns were heard, but they stopped after a moment. Suddenly, a red light shot into the sky in the northeast corner, and the flames were very intense, which lasted for about an hour. It was inside the Japanese position. All the iron fences on the boundary road were guarded by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession. Traffic at the boundary was completely cut off, and idlers were not allowed to approach the posts. The situation was very serious. Japanese soldiers were also stationed at the North Sichuan Road Bridge. The electric lights of the New Asia Hotel were all turned off. The area facing north was full of Japanese soldier posts, and there were no pedestrians. In front of the Dali Yuan Pawnshop at the intersection of Haining Road, Japanese soldiers piled up sandbags, which were guarded by plainclothes soldiers and Japanese police of the Public Concession. The plainclothes enemy troops on North Sichuan Road were lingering in groups of three or five.

The North China Daily News Blames the Japanese Navy

Today, the North China Daily News had an editorial criticizing the Sino-Japanese situation, stating, "The Japanese military authorities do not trust diplomatic forces and have taken decisive actions in North China, creating a situation in which they control the situation in Tianjin and Peking. Although Shanghai has stated that it has no intention of harming, the massive reinforcement of the navy is not a de facto guarantee. This reinforcement cannot be considered the result of the Hongqiao Incident. In other countries, this would clearly be a state of war. The seriousness of the situation cannot be denied, but the cause of this situation is the Japanese side's misunderstanding of the Chinese situation. For months, Japanese public opinion has held a pessimistic view of the Sino-Japanese conflict, and the hasty measures taken by the army and navy authorities have led to this. Since the Hongqiao Incident in Shanghai, the efforts of the authorities on both sides to maintain calm have been quite commendable, but the arrival of a large number of Japanese warships in Shanghai has suddenly made the situation extremely bad. Without diplomatic negotiations to reverse the situation, conflict will be difficult to avoid." (Translated by the Haitong News Agency)

### Zhang Zhizhong Appointed Garrison Commander of Nanjing and Shanghai

Representative of the Shanghai Garrison, Xing Zhennan, and Others Host Reporters, Hoping That the Press and the Army Will Unite to Resist Foreign Aggression

Zhang Zhizhong, who served as the commander of the Fifth Army during the January 28 Incident and directed the 87th, 88th, and Er Divisions to resist the violent enemy, has now been appointed Garrison Commander of Nanjing and Shanghai. In addition to establishing the headquarters, Zhang Zhizhong has also appointed Xing Zhennan and Tang Wu as representatives stationed in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, Xing and Tang hosted reporters from local newspapers at the Atlantic Restaurant, with dozens of people attending. During the dinner, Xing stood up to deliver a speech, stating that in order to maintain peace, our country has repeatedly tolerated and conceded to the violent Japanese aggression. This painstaking effort is known to the world. However, the violent Japanese are insatiably greedy and keep moving inch by inch. Since the North China Incident, they have provoked hostilities everywhere. The Hongqiao Incident also occurred in this city. While our country is trying its best to seek a diplomatic solution, they are greatly increasing their troops, and today they are attacking our defenses again, attempting to expand the incident. For the sake of self-defense, our side has no choice but to retaliate against the aggressors. The current situation has reached the most critical moment. At this time of national crisis and survival, the whole country must unite and cooperate, and we especially hope that colleagues in the press will closely contact the army and jointly resist foreign aggression, etc. Xing also reported on the situation in Japan as discussed by those who recently returned from Japan. It is said that the Japanese warlords are militaristic, wantonly aggressive, and the people in the country are full of resentment. Recently, the government issued a mobilization order to recruit reservists, but most people are unwilling to enlist. Therefore, the number of people killed and committed suicide is hundreds in Tokyo alone. The Japanese domestic finances are also very difficult. Each soldier on the expedition receives 50 yuan per month for family expenses. Japan will definitely not be able to support this huge military expenditure for a year.

Nanjing Correspondence

### Honest Talk

— Chengzhai

Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred on July 7th, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly made clear and affirmative declarations, which have been unanimously supported by the whole country and are also our national policy. With national policies having been decided upon, the people are all happy to follow, and everything is proceeding accordingly. We only need to wait and see, and there is no need to add any more words for embellishment. However, the people's fervent expectations and the silence of the news from the capital are becoming proportional. As a result, attitudes vary, and there is no consensus. In a recent speech, Mr. Wang Jingwei said that the nation is in dire straits, and we should tell the truth. I dare to follow this principle and briefly mention what I know to dispel the doubts of the masses.

The people have no objection to the national policy declared by Chiang, but what they are pondering and have not yet been relieved of is whether the current response to the incident is purely military action or also involves diplomacy. If we talk about military action, when should the bugles be blown and the horns sounded? To what extent should the whole country be mobilized? If we talk about diplomacy, is there any room for maneuver in the twists and turns? To what extent can the final hope reach? These are all honest words that the people want to ask, but also something that they hesitate to say. Now, I will try to answer them below.

The cause of this incident was the deliberate aggression of Japan, displaying its military force. How could we simply accept it? Of course, we had to resist. However, the strategy of resistance, military and diplomatic, could have been pursued concurrently. Therefore, the central government first and foremost made a decisive decision, declared the national policy, and instructed Song Zheyuan to defend the territory and resist the war. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also publicly stated its willingness to negotiate to find a diplomatic solution. Resisting the war is to treat the symptoms, and diplomatic negotiations are to address the root cause. Different paths lead to the same destination, which is to show our policy of "being supple without being submissive and being firm without being aggressive." This is morally appropriate. Unexpectedly, Song hesitated between peace and war repeatedly, until he could neither negotiate peace nor fully prepare for war. The 29th Army was brave and commendable, defending the territory unyieldingly, but digging a well when thirsty could not alleviate the crisis. Before long, Pingjin fell. What more diplomatic negotiation could there be? As for Japan, on the one hand, it indulged in military force, and on the other hand, considering its national strength, even the government had a prudent faction. It certainly did not want to use force on all fronts immediately. As a result, there was a situation where the storm could end before the day was over. Ambassador Kawagoe was scheduled to return at the end of July. However, the end of July was when our Pingjin fell. Since Japan had gained something, it could afford to take a breath. We, on the other hand, had suffered a blow, how could we silently rest? Chairman Chiang was saddened by the increasingly serious national crisis and made a second declaration. Kawagoe, as a person who was about to travel, added consideration after hearing this first announcement and delayed his departure again and again before finally coming. This shows that our national policy not only states the sacrifice of war, but also has a clear framework for diplomacy. If it does not fall outside this framework, there is nothing that cannot be discussed. If it falls outside the framework, there is no reason to submit. As of today, in addition to military preparations, the door to diplomacy has not been completely closed, but there is no need to pursue it exclusively.

If we talk about military affairs, the national policy has the saying of responding to war without seeking war. At the beginning of the Lugouqiao Incident, the 29th Army firmly defended and did not retreat, which was its beginning. However, because the situation was still chaotic at the beginning, and the north and south were separated, it was difficult to achieve extreme contact. As a result, the Central Army marched north day and night, but Pingjin had already fallen. If we talk about it from a military point of view, from the point of view of national strength, we are a weak country, which we do not shy away from saying. Using weakness to resist strength can lead to defeat, but we cannot surrender. We can sacrifice, but we cannot serve with silk and jade. This is the way for a weak country to stand, and it is also what our national policy emphasizes. Now that the 29th Army retreated due to not winning the war of resistance, it did not lag behind in responding to the war, and the support was extremely difficult, which is recognized by the Chinese people and conforms to the original intention of the national policy. Now that there is a little more time, and the reserves are more substantial, if a strong enemy comes, will there really be no one who bravely responds to the war? Now that the Japanese have occupied Pingjin, from a military point of view, it is difficult to defend it in isolation. Therefore, they are attacking Nankou and Yanqing in the north, hoping to merge the Chahar province and connect to Rehe. They are looking south at the Jinpu and Pinghan railways to shield Beiping. This is inevitable. The front line has been quieter in recent days precisely because it is taking measures to occupy Pingjin and waiting for reinforcements to arrive. We are also taking advantage of this time to properly plan and prepare. The situation of stubbornly resisting is waiting in silence for the arrival of a major war. The Chinese people are filled with righteous indignation and want to spill their blood. It does not matter whether it is sooner or later. Sharpening the sword is also not to be bothered by determining the exact date.

National mobilization is not something that can be done overnight. It is difficult to judge the extent to which it should be done at the beginning. However, from the central government to various localities, whether it is a public official or an ordinary citizen, almost everyone is in the process of mobilization. Modern warfare first values the establishment of a simple, effective, direct, and controlled wartime system to inherit the dilatory pace of a hundred officials serving the public in peacetime. Now that the full war has not yet begun, this system is being carefully planned. When needed, it will use first-class talents, the fewest number of personnel, the most economical methods, and the most appropriate command to achieve the greatest results and the most flexible operation. It can be said with certainty. Also, when the war is about to expand, the government must also plan to use people according to their abilities and adapt to local conditions, so that the government must also have a plan, and the senior officials of the provinces will come to Beijing one after another to listen to the instructions, each performing their duties, and there is no need to push the enemy. In addition, the stability of the rear, the people's livelihood, and even the storage of food, the maintenance of the economy, the care of the elderly and the young, and the rescue of the dying and the injured, even though we are a newly emerging weak country and have no wartime experience, we are now catching up quickly and trying our best to do well. Even if it is inevitably rushed, it should be reflected in the measures. Since we are prepared for thorough sacrifice, there is no need to cherish it. If we can plan comprehensively and hope that the country will survive for one more day, we will be able to resist the enemy for one more day. Then the final victory can be confidently expected.

Leaving aside military affairs and talking about diplomacy, the path of diplomacy is still there, but today, the room for diplomacy is narrow. Ambassador Kawagoe has been stationed in China for many years and knows a lot about the situation in our country. As an ambassador, he must hope that international disputes can be resolved through negotiation. However, if we look at his negotiations with Mr. Zhang Yuejun when he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs last year, both sides had already been extremely frank, but ultimately no result was achieved. Based on his experience, does he not know better than last year what the psychology of the Chinese people is today and what kind of stimulation they have received? 推 Kawagoe believes that he can use diplomacy to seek peace between China and Japan. It is his duty and his long-cherished wish. If the two countries fight each other with swords and weapons, and the hatred lasts forever, harming both sides, it is what he does not want to see or hear. Now that he is coming south, it is originally to return to the government and report the duties to the country, but it is not impossible for him to make one last effort for his long-cherished wish. I dare to presume, if it can be successful, he will go all out, otherwise, he will only keep his reputation. However, the facts created by the military have already reached this point, so keeping this wiggle room may only become a memorial on a page of the archives.

As for diplomacy, we certainly do not abandon it, and the hope of negotiations, whether in the government or among the people, is absolutely limited to the national policy declared by Chairman Chiang. This limit has already been clearly established, and there is no flexibility for both sides to compromise. Pingjin has already entered a state of occupation. The Japanese army has entered the city with troops, and the announcements are bright and clear. Security has been strictly controlled. Although nothing has been heard about administration in recent days, its active progress is self-evident. At the time of Beiping's fall, Song Zheyuan still asked Zhang Zizhong to replace the chairman and gradually establish a public security maintenance committee, but Zhang had resigned from the committee and entered the hospital. Since news is cut off these days, even the facilities of this maintenance committee are not known. It is even more likely that someone has risen to replace this maintenance committee, and it is self-evident that administrative power has fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. Can we say that as a result of negotiations, the Japanese will relinquish both administrative and military powers, restore the gold to the country, and return it to our country? The people of the country are certainly not daring to have such extravagant hopes of gaining something without effort. Can we say that we are willing to acknowledge the loss of some actual powers and only recover the name of Pingjin? Then the national policy already has a clear statement that no territory or sovereignty can be lost. If we say that we will delegate it to the local authorities to resolve this problem through other compromise methods, then the national policy also has a provision that there can be no partial solution in the future. In short, between the two countries, the military is in contact, and they have already occupied it in fact, and we have a national policy of four points of standing, in which there is absolutely no possibility of passing off something that is fake. Even if it stops here, it is difficult to reach an agreement, let alone they are still seeking to advance, and we are not stingy with sacrifice. Due to the stimulation of the people of both countries, there is a risk of new facts occurring at any time and in any place. If everything can be resolved diplomatically at this time, then those who exercise the power of diplomacy must be able to turn stinky tofu into magic, which I fear is not something that ordinary diplomats can achieve.

Now the whole country is surging, and people are in a state of excitement. As the place where the government comes from, the capital is particularly noteworthy for those who are engaged in public service and those who are concerned about national affairs. After tea and wine, they are used as a means of conversation, but only superficially, and anyone is inevitably at a loss. When friends meet, they often discuss and research, but there are only superficial words and few sincere words. I am moved by Mr. Wang's advocacy of telling the truth, so I dare to present the facts and listen to the readers to know my guilt is what is from.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Shanghai Cannon Fire Resounds Again

— Xiang

The cannon fire in Shanghai has resumed. According to Japanese propaganda, it is adamantly uncertain who fired first, who initiated the conflict. However, no one can testify to this question, nor can any evidence be found. However, what I want to ask is, in recent days, the Japanese have brought no fewer than thirty warships and no fewer than seven or eight thousand soldiers. I ask, what is the purpose? This is ironclad evidence. Therefore, the question of responsibility for this war, who should be blamed, is self-evident.

To fight, then fight outright; to make peace, then make peace outright. Neither fighting nor making peace, fighting and making peace at the same time. Under such circumstances, we do not know how much we have suffered. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese side has been increasing troops and transporting weapons, using the incident as an excuse to expand, while declaring that the situation would not escalate and using political means to resolve it to cover up their actions. These are mostly deceptive talks. Our country originally did not hope for war, much less want it. However, the Japanese side has been pushing step by step to such an extent that we have almost no way to go. We can only resort to war. Besides war, what other method is sufficient to control the ambitions of the imperialists? Besides war, what other method is sufficient to awaken the aggressors from their delusions?

At this time, perhaps there are third parties who believe that once the war starts, it will definitely damage their partial interests or even disrupt world peace. They spare no effort to mediate. They do not know that this kind of behavior only serves to fuel the enemy's arrogance. ㊀ It demonstrates the cowardice and fear of power of various countries. ㊁ It allows the enemy to make full preparations during this period. ㊂ It weakens the psychology of those who hope for peace but cannot avoid war. Therefore, the fall of Tianjin and Beiping, and the firing in Zhabei, have not only closed the door to peace but also cut off the path to mediation.

Since the Lugouqiao Incident, we have held to the principle of turning big issues into small issues and small issues into no issues, and we have been dealing with them. How could we know that if we retreated one step, they would advance two steps; if we retreated one inch, they would advance one foot. This has brought us to a point where we have nowhere to retreat. In short, the door to peace has always been open on our side. But now it has long been closed, door by door, by the Japanese side. The Lugouqiao incident saw the Japanese close one door. The Langfang incident saw the Japanese close another door. The Tianjin-Beiping campaign closed the great door of peace. Now, the Zhabei campaign has even closed the back door of peace. What is left now? Only war. Only desperate war.

Regardless of victory or defeat, regardless of gain or loss, we can only risk the lives of the entire nation and engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. We can only gamble on the fate of the country and deal with the enemy. We must make the enemy suffer great pain before we stop. As of the time of this reporter's writing, the cannon fire at Bazihqiao and Tiantong'an is still shaking the earth. News of our occupying certain places and seizing certain factories is constantly being reported. I think our brave and spirited soldiers are exactly at the time when charging into battle is most suitable.

### Cracks Appear in Japan's Policy Towards China

Young Officers Control Politics; Veteran Statesmen Advocate Moderation; Konoe's Situation is Difficult, He May Resign

[Nanjing] A well-informed individual with intimate knowledge of the Japanese political situation stated that since the September 18th Incident, Japan's policy towards China has been controlled by the military. After the Lugouqiao Incident, young officers became even more arrogant. The Tokyo government can only deal with the accomplished facts and cannot put forward any proposals beforehand. The deterioration of North China and the increase of troops in Shanghai are all the work of these military personnel, seeking personal promotion and wealth. However, innocent civilians are being drafted into military service, and complaints are rampant. The huge amount of military expenditure is likely to lead to bankruptcy, which has already caused an unprecedented crisis in Japan. It is heard that major cracks have now appeared within the Japanese government. Veteran statesmen mostly advocate moderation and focus on economic development. The military advocates a high degree of autonomy for the five provinces of Hebei and Chahar, or at least a neutral zone for the three provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Shandong, and free ports for Tianjin and Qingdao. The two sides are arguing fiercely, and some even advocate convening an Imperial Conference to determine the final policy. Prime Minister Konoe is in a difficult situation and may resign as a last resort. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)

As a result, it was decided that Japan should take strict action. This resolution will be submitted to the emergency cabinet meeting this morning for its approval. Those who attended the meeting last night included the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Naval Minister, and the Army Minister.

[Tokyo] Due to the North China Incident and the Shanghai dispute, relations between China and Japan have suddenly become perilous. The government is making every effort to find countermeasures. Now, all parties are adapting to the situation in China and adopting a quasi-wartime system, which has become the unanimous opinion of the entire country. The financial authorities, based on the Konoe Cabinet's policy guidelines, must adapt to the new situation after the North China Incident when compiling the budget for the 13th year, tightening subsidies and other expenses, with national defense expenditures as the core, and adopting a wartime budget compilation. This view is also a powerful argument within the cabinet. (Allied News Agency dispatch on the 13th)

The "Manchester Guardian" stated, "If a Sino-Japanese war breaks out, Japan will threaten Shanghai from the sea in order to weaken China's strength, and European countries will also be unable to rest easy."

### Urgent Issues in Today's Transportation (II)

— Rui Ling

(IV) Chinese railways, due to the complex historical relationships and different investment backgrounds, each railway regards its rolling stock and mechanical equipment as its own private property. Clear boundaries are drawn with other railways, and there is no willingness to accommodate each other. Sometimes, some railways have soldiers but no goods to transport, while others have goods but no rolling stock. Before the September 18th Incident, the Beining Railway had the most rolling stock due to the many vehicles seized from other railways during the successive entries of the Feng Army into Guanzhong. However, in the end, most of it was given to the enemy! Even until recently, the rolling stock owned by the Beining Railway, in proportion to the length of the line, was still more than that of other railways. However, now it has been given to the enemy again. One of the important reasons for the Iron Ministry's inability to fully dispatch the rolling stock of all railways, resulting in lost opportunities, must be attributed to this. In fact, they are all state-owned railways, all national assets. It only depends on how to use them most effectively and appropriately. Why should we distinguish between what belongs to Railway A and what belongs to Railway B? Even if there are different economic backgrounds, we can find ways to record them separately in accounting. However, dispatching should be centralized and unified, especially now that the situation is urgent. All rolling stock of all railways in the country should be nationalized, and the Iron Ministry should dispatch them centrally, allocating an appropriate number to each railway according to actual needs. The number allocated to each railway can be changed at any time according to the situation. When dispatching, the number of vehicles operating and staying in dangerous areas, such as the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, should be reduced to the minimum to prevent sudden incidents and prevent them from being utilized by the enemy. In the future, all new rolling stock purchased from abroad, regardless of which railway funded the purchase, should be treated as nationally owned and dispatched by the ministry, except for appropriate accounting arrangements.

(V) If war breaks out, and it is a protracted war, we must strive for speed in the military transport to the front and strive for rationality in the circulation of goods in the rear. Therefore, there should be a unified dispatching agency in the front and a system of transportation control should be implemented in the rear. This matter has countless aspects and cannot be described in detail in a separate article. Simply put, in the front, it is most taboo to have multiple orders issued, making it impossible for those who are engaged in the work to know what to do, resulting in chaos. Therefore, there should be a supreme dispatching agency. No army may arbitrarily requisition vehicles without an order from the agency, and no army may arbitrarily transport non-urgent items without the agency's approval. The standard for vehicle capacity should be quickly determined, such as how many infantrymen can sit in each vehicle, how many vehicles are needed for each division, how many cavalrymen and their horses can fit in each vehicle, how many vehicles are needed for each division, how much artillery and its cannons can fit in each vehicle, how many vehicles are needed for each brigade, how the transportation and distribution of supplies should be regulated, and how quickly wounded soldiers should be transported. All of this should have detailed planning and appropriate dispatching. As for the rear, what kind of goods are suitable for water transport, what kind of goods can be transported by road, and what kind of goods must be transported by train? How to reject or reduce the transportation of goods that are not related to military national defense or are not beneficial to the national economy? How to continuously transport daily necessities from various places to prevent panic? How to provide various conveniences for export goods so that they can exchange for foreign funds to increase combat power? The current urgent work is to quickly establish a unified military transportation dispatching agency in the front, and to quickly prepare to implement control measures in the rear based on past goods circulation. Most of China's coal mines are in North China. After the outbreak of war, the fuel problem in major cities should be taken into account as early as possible. It would be best to maintain the original transportation status and continue to supply fuel. Otherwise, where can substitutes be obtained, and how should this new situation be adapted to? This should also be planned in advance, not only for the transportation of fuel, but also for the transportation of other daily necessities.

(VI) Repair materials should be quickly stored in important locations on each railway. In modern warfare, the power of air force destruction is extremely great. For all targets that can be bombed by the air force, repair materials should be prepared to repair and restore traffic at any time. Important bridges especially need this. Therefore, sufficient preparation should be made for the wood and parts for building pontoon bridges, and they should be prepared near each important bridge for emergencies. However, they should still be placed in the safest place to prevent them from falling into the hands of the enemy or being destroyed by the enemy.

(VII) The Yangtze River and its tributaries are the most important transportation hub in central China and are waterways that are not subject to bombing by enemy planes. Therefore, once war breaks out, we must be able to fully utilize the Yangtze River and its tributaries to maintain our transportation. If we want to be able to fully utilize them, on the one hand, we must ensure the safety of the waterways, and on the other hand, we must have water transport tools. Our navy is too weak, and we have no room for activity along the coast. In the future, coastal transportation can only rely on foreign merchant ships. However, we must take responsibility for the transportation of the Yangtze River waterway ourselves. We should, at the appropriate time, move all the ships that can be transferred to the Yangtze River to the Yangtze River, both merchant ships and warships. The active role is to take on the responsibility of inland river water transportation during wartime, and the passive role is to avoid shelling and capture by enemy ships. After the navy is concentrated in the Yangtze River, it can hold the key points of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, preventing enemy ships from entering. If there are still enemy ships that have not withdrawn, they must be disarmed. Only in this way can the safety of the waterways be guaranteed, merchant ships can travel freely except for defense against air raids, and naval warships can also help with transportation when necessary. I feel that we have now reached the time when we should concentrate all our navy and shipping to the Yangtze River, the Pearl River, and other inland rivers! Look! Japan has already requisitioned all its domestic merchant ships to transport troops and has ordered Japanese ships operating in China to return home to take on military transportation tasks! Moreover, in addition to this, it has also leased two ships from British merchants to strengthen its transportation capacity! Japanese expatriates are returning to their country in batches! A major war is imminent. Can we still allow our own merchant ships to sail from Shanghai to North China and South China, preparing to be captured by the Japanese navy? Hurry up and concentrate them, disperse them to various parts of the Yangtze River under the protection of the navy, and prepare to take on the important mission of inland river transportation in the future! Therefore, we should temporarily give way to foreign merchant ships for coastal navigation at this critical time. At the very least, we should reduce the number of sailings to a minimum! If we cannot use the Yangtze River as a wartime transportation artery during wartime and fully develop its transportation capacity, then we will be cutting off our own arteries, and how can we hope to operate freely? When the time comes, we should no longer only consider the gains and losses of that time, but should look at the big picture and the long term. I hope the naval authorities will pay attention!

### London Air Defense Drill Achieves Satisfactory Results

Proving Security Can Be Ensured

[London] Air defense drills were conducted on the night of the 9th of this month over the urban and northeastern suburbs of this city. Both the attacking and defending sides each used 200 bombers and fighter planes. It is now known that the results of the exercise are quite encouraging, meaning that London is one of the most difficult cities in the world to attack from the air. According to expert calculations, during the exercise, approximately 80% of the attacking planes were intercepted by the defending forces and unable to carry out their attacks, which serves as clear proof. The experts also stated that British Air Force pilots are accustomed to the country's climate and can fly regardless of the weather, while foreign Air Force pilots cannot.

### Fierce Fighting on the Tianjin-Pukou Front Line

Over Two Hundred Japanese Cavalrymen Defeated by Our Forces; Japanese Planes Dropped Over Ten Bombs on Machang

According to local communications from Jinan, the Japanese army on the Tianjin-Pukou line has repeatedly advanced south in recent days, but has been bravely repelled by our forces. Therefore, the positions of both sides have not changed. As of the morning of the 11th, our army was firmly defending the south side of the destroyed railway bridge north of Jinghai and the west side of the Grand Canal, while the Japanese army was concentrated in Duliu and on the east bank of the Grand Canal, also laying landmines on the main road north of Jinghai. After 10:00 AM, the Japanese army suddenly launched artillery fire on our army's position, firing intermittently, each time with more than ten shots. After 1:00 PM, over 200 Japanese cavalrymen suddenly charged towards Wulipu, about five li north of our Jinghai position, under the cover of artillery fire. They were surrounded by our army on three sides, and a fierce battle ensued. Our side immediately increased the deployment of a certain unit to participate in the battle, while launching a flanking attack on Yangliuqing from the left flank. The Japanese army was unable to withstand it, and its cavalry retreated north in a disorganized manner at 10:00 PM on the 11th. At 11:40 PM, the Jinghai Chen position was completely under our army's control and is now advancing forward. According to reports from Tangguantun, there has been no artillery fire from the Japanese side since late in the night of the 11th.

### Efforts by Consuls-General of Various Countries in Shanghai to Mediate Peace Unsuccessful

We Will Respect and Protect Foreign Nationals

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Consuls-General of Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and other countries in Shanghai made a final effort to mediate peace in a private capacity. However, the Japanese side was determined to invade and showed no sincerity, so the efforts of the consuls were unsuccessful. The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, seeing that peace was hopeless, are extremely concerned about the security of the concessions. It is reported that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was deployed the night before last, and the armored vehicles of the French Concession have also been deployed. At the same time, the detectives have all put on steel helmets and are on strict alert. According to a spokesman for our military authorities, the responsibility for the outbreak of the Shanghai war rests entirely with the Japanese side, which has long been recognized by people of all countries. Our side will respect and protect the lives and property of foreign nationals in the concessions, but we deeply hope that the concession authorities will not provide the aggressors with various conveniences through the concessions.

### Silver and Banking Industries Ordered to Close for Two Days, Allowed to Reopen on the 16th

Yesterday morning, the silver and banking industry associations received an order from the Ministry of Finance that, since the Shanghai war had already begun, all banks and money shops should close for two days. Therefore, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and various commercial banks, money shops, trust companies, savings associations, the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry, the bill exchange, the acceptance office, the money industry reserve, the money industry market, etc., all complied with the order to close for two days starting at 10:15 AM, and posted announcements at the entrance of each bank and business stating, "By order of the Ministry of Finance, due to the start of the war, we will temporarily close for two days starting from 10:15 AM today."

The Banking Association dispatched Chen Guangfu, Du Yuesheng, Song Ziliang, and others, and the Money Industry Association dispatched Qin Runxiang, Shao Yanshan, and others to visit Vice Minister of Finance Xu Kan this morning to request instructions on measures to stabilize wartime finance in the silver and banking industries.

Business as Usual for Foreign Merchants

Foreign merchant banks, including HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, London and China, Chartered Bank, New Sassoon, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, etc., are operating as usual. Japanese merchant banks, including Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui, Taiwan Bank, Korean Bank, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, etc., are also operating as usual.

Foreign Exchange Premium

Yesterday, the Shanghai banking industry, due to the Ministry of Finance's telegram order to suspend operations for two days in preparation for wartime finance, only had spot exchange trading. The premium futures market was also suspended. However, a certain bank sold 700 taels of the existing premium, with a price of 1,185 yuan, which was distributed equally among the 13 members of the Yinlou Bangda Tongxing. According to sources close to a certain bank, the maintenance of the spot exchange will not be stopped, and 700 taels will be supplied daily for regulation. However, it is carefully stated that silver shops must not change the jewelry gold price. (Calculated according to the current premium of 1,185 yuan, the 烚赤 should be around 1,290 yuan.) It has been found that a batch of current premiums was traded on August 4, with a price of 1,330 yuan, a discount of 145 yuan. Public debt is only a small touch of 96 debts, also about 7 jiao.

### French Concession Notice to Residents for Peaceful Business

The French Concession authorities, in view of the second outbreak of war in Shanghai, and with the need to make meticulous arrangements for security within the concession, convened a meeting of key personnel from various departments last night.

### Jiangyin River Blockade, Waterway Traffic Severed

First, the Huangpu River will be blocked at the 16th Pier section. Five giant ships will be sunk to block the river at Jiangyin.

The waterway traffic at Jiangyin in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was effectively blockaded yesterday. All foreign merchant ships on the Yangtze River have been announced to cease operations. Details are as follows:

Sinking Ships in the Huangpu River

From the 16th Pier Ning Shao Wharf in the southern section of the Huangpu River in this port, our side began preparing to block the river surface on the night of the 16th, in order to prevent enemy warships from approaching Gaochang Temple and other places. A large number of sand barges were detained, and over one hundred were selected to be towed to Wusong for use. Yesterday morning, in front of the 16th Pier Ning Shao Wharf, the detained Daxing Company's Fuxing Wheel, Sanjiang Transportation's Dayun, and the Zhonghua fishing boat were simultaneously sunk into the river. In addition, two 600-ton sand barges were sunk next to the four ships. Furthermore, the detained Zhongxing Wheel, with a load capacity of 4,267 tons and a draft of 21 feet, was abandoned in the Pudong river area for the final blockage of the Huangpu River. Currently, small sampans can barely pass through both sides, but ships and warships can no longer sail into the southern Huangpu River. Three Japanese warships stationed south of Xinkai River immediately fled and anchored elsewhere after our blockade.

Jiangyin Blockade

The implementation of the blockade at Jiangyinkou has completely cut off Yangtze River traffic. Yangtze River ships of various Chinese and foreign shipping companies in Shanghai, such as Mingxing, Xinming, Wuhu, Wusong, etc., are blocked upstream of Jiangyin and cannot move, all at a loss for what to do. Enemy warships absolutely cannot pass through the Jiangyin river area.

Ships Disappear

Yesterday, the Taikoo Shipping's New Beijing arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo, entering the port at 9:00 AM and departing as usual at 4:00 PM, limited to carrying 500 passengers. The New Ning Shao entered the port at 12:00 PM and departed at 3:00 PM, specifically carrying refugees out of Shanghai. Apart from these two ships, no other ships left the port. Starting today, except for British foreign ships that occasionally sail, Chinese merchant ships have disappeared. Navigation on the entire Suzhou Creek, regardless of civilian or cargo ships, is prohibited, and waterway traffic on both the Yangtze River and inland rivers is completely cut off.

### Chinese and Westerners Jointly Form International Relief Organization

The society also decided to hold its first standing committee meeting at the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee at 5:00 PM this afternoon to elect a chairman and actively handle relief matters.

### City's Relief Organizations Mobilized Yesterday

All relief organizations in this city have been fully mobilized yesterday, concentrating in two locations, one at the Country Hospital and the other at Lake Side Mansion. The entire group departed at 3:00 PM yesterday to serve in the war zone. Various war zone service teams also departed separately to assist the defense forces in constructing defensive works, working together, and singing patriotic songs that resonated in the sky. Various fellow-townsman associations, carrying their respective flags, went to various locations within the concession to receive displaced refugees. The situation on all sides was extremely chaotic.

Ningbo Fellow-Townsman Association Begins Receiving

According to a telegram from Ningbo, since the registration of fellow-townsman relief personnel began, as of yesterday, there were 200 people. In view of the serious situation in Shanghai, a relief meeting was specifically convened at 9:00 AM yesterday. Under the chairmanship of Chen Zhongbi, it was resolved to divide the group into ten teams, with twenty people in each team, and to divide them into various groups responsible for ambulance assistance, reception, information supply, ships, and medicine. The responsible personnel for each group have also been determined as follows: Director Mao Heyuan, Deputy Directors Chen Zhonggao and Chen Yiting, and Secretary General Shen Jiucheng. The first reception center has been established at the Siming Guild Hall on Minkuo Road, and the second reception center has been established at the Dinghai Guild Hall on Pingjili Road, to begin receiving fellow-townsman refugees and to send personnel to care for fellow-townsmen returning to their hometowns.

Songjiang Fellow-Townsmen Prepare to Mobilize

The Shanghai Songjiang Fellow-Townsman Association convened an emergency meeting of the board of directors yesterday due to the outbreak of an extraordinary incident in Shanghai. It was resolved to fully mobilize to participate in wartime service work, and to find suitable locations as soon as possible to receive and resettle fellow-townsmen seeking refuge.

Jingwu Martial Arts Association Conducts Poison Gas Drill

The Shanghai Jingwu Martial Arts Association, in view of the fact that the national crisis has reached a final juncture and a full-scale war of resistance is about to begin, is actively promoting work during extraordinary times. It has reached an agreement with the city's relief committee to open a wartime relief training class with a quota of 300 people, divided into six classes, with morning and evening sessions. The first and second classes are scheduled to officially begin on the 16th and 17th. In order to publicize common knowledge of poison gas prevention to citizens, a large-scale poison gas drill and first aid knowledge training will be held. Charts and models of poison gas warfare will be displayed publicly, and instructions will be given on the use of gas masks and clothing, as well as detoxification and first aid. Medical knowledge will be taught. The opening ceremony is scheduled for the 20th, lasting three days. Starting next week, admission tickets will be issued. At 7:30 PM on the 17th, Mr. Hu Yuzhi will give a public lecture on "The International Situation After the Outbreak of War Between China and Japan." All are welcome to attend. In addition, a wartime military hospital and refugee shelter are being planned. If any sectors wish to contact us, please go to the Special Zone Branch Office of the association on the third floor of the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road, telephone number 93285.

Relief Society Hopes Various Sectors Will Set Up Reception Centers

The relief committee organized by the city's Social Affairs Bureau, the Charity Federation, and the Local Associations has been working very hard since its establishment. Since the situation in this city became serious yesterday, the secretariat has been working with the reception department and has set up reception centers in the First Special District to provide relief to refugees coming to Shanghai. However, there are a particularly large number of people seeking refuge this time, and the existing centers of the association are really difficult to accommodate. If there are benevolent people willing to contribute funds to set up centers to receive refugees, they can contact the reception group of the association at Renji Hall on Dama Road, or Mr. Wang Boyuan at the Local Associations or the China Reclamation Bank on Avenue Edward VII.

Yousheng Troupe Establishes Third Hospital

The Yousheng Travel Troupe Relief Association has established the Third Relief Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross. Yesterday, a fundraising declaration was issued (text omitted for brevity).

The association will use receipts of one, five, and ten yuan as proof. Each booklet totals fifty yuan. For caution's sake, if the donor loses the receipt, he must compensate for the amount.

### Foreign Warships Concentrated in the Huangpu River

Total of Eight Ships

The Asian US Fleet's Shanghai warship Loncle-Manes has been moved from the US Navy pontoon in the Huangpu River to the vicinity of the Shanghai Power Company in Yangshupu, as the company is a US industry and an important public utility. However, no soldiers have yet landed. The US Navy pontoon is now docked with a US supply ship. In addition, there are two British warships, three French warships, and one Italian warship in the Huangpu River. Another French warship entered the port at 2:05 PM yesterday.

### City Chamber of Commerce Urgently Requests Curbing Profiteering Rice Merchants

Rice Prices Soar to Sixteen Yuan; Various Groups Express Outrage

The City Rice Industry Association announced a few days ago that the city has more than 800,000 piculs of rice in stock, which is sufficient and will absolutely not affect the people's food supply. Unexpectedly, yesterday, due to the serious situation in Shanghai, rice shops raised prices one after another, soaring more than two yuan in one day, with each picul selling for sixteen yuan and several jiao. This is clearly an attempt to manipulate prices for profit, which is extremely hateful. Various groups in the City Chamber of Commerce are very indignant about this and have asked the Rice Industry Association to order all groups to quickly curb this. At the same time, they have also petitioned the municipal government authorities to thoroughly investigate and deal with this, so as not to affect the people's food supply and plunge the livelihoods of ordinary people into despair.

### Wu Ruiyuan Contributes 150,000 to National Salvation

Type W National Salvation Bonds; An Unprecedented Individual

Mr. Wu Ruiyuan, a prominent Shanghai textile merchant, is known for his generosity. He usually donates a great deal to local public welfare and other undertakings. Now, with the national crisis at hand, the people have launched a national salvation donation to support the government. Individuals and groups are making donations of tens or hundreds of thousands in succession, showing that their patriotic zeal has reached a boiling point. Now, Wu has donated 150,000 yuan of Type W National Salvation Bonds in his individual name, which has been handed over to the China Remittance Bank for collection. Wu can be considered the unprecedented individual in Shanghai's national salvation donations.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Issues Statement Maintaining Peace Zone in Concessions

Shanghai Volunteer Corps Deployed to Patrol; Troops from Various Countries Assist in Sections

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a statement to the public last night. The translation is as follows: "At this extraordinary time, the duty of the Municipal Council is to use all methods within its power to ensure the safety of life and property within its jurisdiction, maintain the public order of the Public Concession, and maintain a good administrative structure. To achieve this goal, and as a necessary part of defense arrangements, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has been mobilized and is being assisted by troops from certain countries to cooperate with the police in maintaining the Public Concession as a peaceful zone where all residents, regardless of nationality, can live and work in peace. All those who care about the public interest are urged to cooperate with the authorities as much as possible, and to gladly endure any inconveniences, and to generally assist in maintaining calm, security, and order."

Chinese Company of the Volunteer Corps Mobilized Urgently

The Chinese Company and Translation Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were urgently mobilized by the headquarters of the corps on the evening of the 12th and immediately assembled at approximately 9:00 PM that evening to await orders. A temporary command post was established at 119 Jiujiang Road, with the company commander, Mr. Chen Shixia, as the commander. It is reported that starting yesterday morning, the Chinese Company has been ordered to guard Tilanqiao Prison, and the translators are responsible for the work of the foreign troops from the United Kingdom and the United States to eliminate the barriers between the military and civilians.

British and American Troops Assist in Defending the Border

Yesterday, the sentries of the Japanese Marine Corps had actually extended south to the Sichuan Road Bridge on Suzhou Creek, posing a clear threat to the concession. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession, since being ordered the night before last, first dispatched infantry, and yesterday morning also dispatched mechanized units. Armored vehicles patrolled Haig Road and Avenue Foch from time to time. Many armored vehicles were also concentrated on the lawn of the Red Church on Jiangxi Road. British troops stationed in Shanghai and US Marines stationed in Shanghai were also dispatched yesterday. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency went to inspect the area west of Shanghai yesterday afternoon and saw British troops piling sandbags and erecting barbed wire in front of the Huxi Railway crossing on Brenan Road and at the end of Jessfield Road, appearing extremely busy. At the same time, a team of American heavy artillery, totaling over one hundred people, was departing on Gordon Road.

Statistics on the Number of Armed Personnel in the Concessions

It is difficult to estimate the total number of armed personnel in the Shanghai concessions, excluding Japanese soldiers. It is estimated that there are approximately 4,600 personnel protecting the Public Concession and the police force, with over 5,000 reservists, approximately 1,000 in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and approximately 960 British Army, including auxiliary troops. There are also 800 sailors, approximately 1,000 US Army, approximately 150 sailors, approximately 700 Italian Army, and approximately 300 sailors. The French Concession police force totals 2,000 people, and there are fewer than 400 Italian soldiers. If the situation becomes urgent, the British battalion stationed in Hong Kong can arrive in Shanghai within two days. The United States can transfer troops from the Philippines, and France can transfer troops from Vietnam to strengthen the defenses of Shanghai.

### City Chamber of Commerce Telephones Request Implementation of Wartime Economy

The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce held a joint emergency meeting of directors and supervisors at 2:00 PM yesterday. Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiqing, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Luo Qinghua, Hu Xiyuan, Zhang Peizhen, Pei Yunqing, Chen Ziming, and over twenty other people attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai first reported that since the Shanghai situation became tense, the Chamber of Commerce, based on the requests of various industry associations, had telephoned the Ministry of Finance to quickly determine financial adjustment and industrial and commercial protection measures, and had invited leaders of the banking and money exchange industries to discuss the matter. Unexpectedly, today, the banks and money exchanges in this city suddenly cited a ministerial order and took a two-day holiday, which is apparently for the sake of preparing for an extraordinary economy during extraordinary times. Should the Chamber of Commerce propose something regarding this matter? It should be discussed. As a result of the discussion by the various committee members present, separate telegrams were sent to the Ministry of Finance and separate letters were sent to the Banking and Money Exchange Associations.

### Charity Groups, Disaster Relief Associations Discuss Methods for Relieving Battlefield Refugees Yesterday

Request Fellow-Townsman Associations to Take Responsibility for Receiving Separately; Determine the Quantity of Provisions and Handle Unifiedly; Relief Association Sets Up Lost Refugee Inquiry Office; Great World Amusement Park Converted to Receive Refugees

The City Relief Association and the Charity Federation United Disaster Relief Association jointly invited representatives from various fellow-townsman associations, schools, and charity groups to hold their first conversation meeting yesterday. Pan Gongzhan presided over the meeting and reported on the purpose of holding the conversation meeting, stating briefly that the war in the city is unavoidable, and in the past two days, refugees fleeing from northern Shanghai, Jianghu, and Wusong have filled the roads and urgently need to be received in order to avoid becoming displaced. Therefore, several requests are made to everyone: ⑴ Fellow-townsman associations are requested to determine the number of refugees they can receive within their capacity. If there are no spare houses to receive them, please determine the number of people they can provide provisions for. Each refugee needs approximately three to four yuan of provisions per month. ⑵ Schools in non-war areas can continue to open, which is the best. If they cannot open, please try to allocate them for use as reception centers. ⑶ Various charity groups are requested to provide as much assistance as possible in carrying out relief work. Subsequently, the representatives present expressed their opinions separately and determined the number of refugees they can receive or provide provisions for, for the association to handle in a unified manner. Also, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Townsman Association held a special committee meeting yesterday to discuss matters related to relieving fellow-townsmen in distress. It was resolved to raise relief donations and try to maintain transportation to send fellow-townsmen back to their hometowns. In addition to setting up a reception center at the Siming Guild Hall, the association plans to add one to three more locations to prevent fellow-townsmen from becoming displaced.

The City Relief Committee has been actively receiving refugees for the past two days, no less than several thousand people. Now the council believes that some refugees' family members may be temporarily separated, which is worse than death, and they are in great pain. Therefore, it has specifically set up a refugee general inquiry office at Renji Shantang on Ernan Road, which will start operating from today. Refugees who have lost family members can request registration at the inquiry office to prepare for recruitment at any time. Refugees from all over the world can directly inquire at the office if they have lost family members. If they are received or registered by the association, they can be claimed. If there are homeless refugees, they can directly contact the Relief Committee and request arrangements for reception and repatriation. Also, people who read the newspapers are requested to provide assistance to refugees along the road who have lost family members and instruct them to come to the inquiry office for inquiries so that families can be reunited and avoid becoming displaced. This is also immeasurable merit.

The Rongji Great World on Eight Immortals Bridge in this city has stopped all dragon entertainment since yesterday due to the outbreak of war in Shanghai and converted it for use as a reception center for wartime refugees.

### A Tour of the Northwest District After the Outbreak of the Shanghai War

Traffic is Cut Off in the Chinese Concession; Many People are Still Relocating; People's Hearts are Inevitably Floating; Local Order is Very Good

The war in Shanghai, committed by the Japanese invaders, began yesterday morning. The northern and western districts of the Public Concession, close to the war zone, have reached the extreme of unrest. The various trends witnessed are described in detail below, which must be of interest to those who care about the reality in the northern Shanghai area.

Volunteer Corps Garrison

The Shanghai Volunteer Corps mobilized a portion of its forces at 8:00 PM the night before last to defend the northwest districts. The American troops are responsible for the defense north of Suzhou Creek, garrisoned at the open space at the intersection of Ke Neng Hai Road, the Municipal Council West District Elementary School, and North Henan Road Bazilu, the Nanyang Elementary School on Kaifeng Road, and the Huisi Police Station ball field. It is heard that the Western District defense is the responsibility of the British Scottish troops. In addition to garrisoning in the Western District, troops are stationed at the Gezhi Public School on Beihai Road in the central district and the racecourse on Jingansi Road. The racecourse also has armored vehicles and other heavy weapons parked inside. As for the troops of other nationalities and the Chinese Company, as of now, they have not all been dispatched.

Tight Security

The areas where the Northern District borders the Chinese territory, such as the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Bazilu, the northern side, the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu, the intersection of North Henan Road and Baoshan Road, the intersection of North Shanxi Road and Jielu, the intersection of Ke Neng Hai Road and Jielu, the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Jielu, the intersection of Aierjin Road and North Zhejiang Road, the intersection of Haining Road and Kaifeng Road, as well as the intersections of Xinjiang Road, Rehe Road, Alabai Sitou Road, and the North Xizang Road Bridge, and the iron gates at the Xinzha Bridge, Niaozhen Road Bridge, and Sampan Factory New Bridge to the west of the bridge, have not been opened all day yesterday. In addition, the alleys directly adjacent to the Chinese territory, such as Gongyi Li, Huatongfang, and Huaxingfang, which have not been equipped with iron gates, are all separated by barbed wire. Therefore, traffic between the concession and Zhabei was completely blocked yesterday. The reporter attempted to go to Zhabei for inspection by car twice, at 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, but despite repeatedly detouring, was unable to reach it. It really felt like being close yet far away. Finally, it was planned to exit Zhongshan Road via Brinan Road, and it was fortunate to pass through the iron gate there, but was stopped by the police on duty on Zhongshan Road, who said that there was already contact ahead, and had to quietly retreat. In addition to the Chinese and Western police posted at each iron gate, a small team of approximately ten Volunteer Corps members armed with guns was added to each location for garrison, making the situation quite serious. The two artillery positions in the middle of North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road and in the middle of Bazilu and North Jiangxi Road had Volunteer Corps members stationed inside them yesterday morning, and there were even more people defending inside and outside the square bunker at the North Xizang Road Bridge. The patrol teams of search police and Volunteer Corps members were patrolling back and forth on various roads along the border, so although people's hearts are inevitably floating, local order is very good. However, the Hongkou and Diswei Road police stations are taking extremely strict precautions due to the location of their regions, and the gate controls are very tight. Chinese and Western investigators must wear uniforms for duty at night.

Relocation Still Flourishing

Yesterday, those who moved south of Suzhou Creek were all from the Hongkou area. The vehicles transporting boxes and cages along the way did not stop from morning to night. Although the residents of Zhabei who had not moved out yesterday wanted to escape the dangerous area, it was extremely difficult to fly over because the concession had been blocked. However, the parents were unwilling to sit idly by and get stuck inside, so they hired boats from the waterways at the west end of Suzhou Creek to cross the river. Therefore, the river banks at Xinzha Bridge and Sampan Factory New Bridge were crowded from morning to dusk. The police station in charge specifically dispatched experienced search police to maintain order on the south bank.

A Glimpse of Hongkou

The area north of Haining Road on North Sichuan Road has entered a state of war. Shops are completely closed, and pedestrians going north only reach the intersection of Bazilu. Trams of the first and second class also turn around there, so there are more Volunteer Corps search police stationed there. Since the contact on the front line, citizens have been standing there, watching the Japanese troops coming and going by car, one after another. The areas of East Haining Road, Wusong Road, Minhang Road, and Youheng Road were originally where Japanese expatriates gathered. Yesterday, very few Chinese passed through those places. On both sides of the road, only young Japanese expatriates were wandering back and forth in groups of three or five. It is said that these people are actually plainclothes troops composed of Japanese veterans.

Court Preparation

The First Special District Local Court and the Second Branch of the High Court, since they are located adjacent to Zhabei, should be prepared to ensure safety and prevent emergencies during this time of war. They have already leased the former site of the Tongyi Trust Company on Beijing Road and have first moved important items to that location. Yesterday, they also hired craftsmen to engage in decoration inside the house. If difficulties in office occur, they will move at any time.

### High Ah Mao and Other Repeat Offenders in Kidnapping Case

The Case of Young Jiang’s Brother: Four Accomplices Released, Remaining Bandits to Intercept the Baohua Steamer

Regarding the case of six-year-old Jiang’s younger brother from Chenmu Town outside Suzhou’s Xumen, who was lured to Shanghai last month on the 14th by bandits and hidden in the French Concession, after which the Hongkou Police arrested the ringleader, Gao Ah Mao from Suzhou, and fifteen others involved in the kidnapping. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. This morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the Third Criminal Court for investigation. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police force stated that after further investigation, suspects Zhou Xiaoyue, Zhu Azong, Dai Xiaodi, and Jin Genrong, four individuals were found to be uninvolved and requested their release, which the court granted. The kidnapped victim, Jiang’s younger brother, is actually named Yu Genfu. His grandmother, Yu Zhang, is present in court to testify that her residence is in Zhuanggang Village outside Suzhou’s Xumen. When Yu was kidnapped, Gao Ah Mao, along with the other defendants, used weapons to first rob 80 yuan in legal tender before kidnapping her grandson, Yu Genfu, and fleeing. Initially, they demanded a ransom of 1,000 yuan. Later, Yu Zhang paid the gang 500 yuan. The ringleader, Gao Ah Mao, lives in

Hujiawan, Chenmu Town, outside Suzhou City, and is a boatman. During the investigation, police detectives, acting on a warrant from the court, went to Suzhou in collaboration with the local police. They secretly searched his home and found two long-barreled rifles, a Spanish-made .32 caliber handgun with the number 229, a cloth bag containing thirty-one gunpowder bullets for the rifle, five flashlights, and two police whistles. It was discovered that the handgun was used during the pirate robbery of the Baohua Steamer at Wusongkou in November of last year, when a passenger was shot and killed; the bullets were fired from that handgun. It was found that Gao Ah Mao and his gang specialized in kidnapping for ransom in the interior and had committed

two other kidnapping cases: ⑴ the victim was killed because the family could not afford the ransom; ⑵ a ransom of 1,500 yuan was obtained. Among the defendants, Gao Xiangsheng and Li Chenshi denied involvement in this case during the police investigation, so their cases were postponed for further investigation. The others all confessed, stating that they were invited by a fugitive named A Jin Tu. The grandmother of the child, Yu Zhang, was force-fed feces and had two pieces of flesh cut from her breasts because she initially refused to pay the ransom. The gang's methods were extremely cruel. The guns and other items found at Gao Ah Mao's home were presented as evidence. After Judge Zhong questioned the defendants, all were remanded in custody for further investigation.

### New Hurricane Reaches Fujian and Zhejiang Waters

According to the Shanghai Observatory's report yesterday morning, a new hurricane in the Pacific Ocean was heading north-northwest. The center was sixty nautical miles away, located at 16 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees 40 minutes east longitude, approximately in the waters between Fujian and Zhejiang.

### Small Plane Lands in Racecourse

Yesterday afternoon at 2:40 PM, a red small training plane landed on the polo field inside the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse. Unfortunately, during the landing, due to a moment of carelessness, the propeller struck the ground and broke, and the right wing immediately hit the ground and collapsed. Both wheels were also damaged. The pilots were two foreigners, but it could not be determined whether they were British or American. It was reported that the two foreigners were associated with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Fortunately, the impact upon landing was very weak, so they were not injured.

### Ferry Sailor Hit by Stray Bullet

Ding Miaoxiang, a 21-year-old sailor on a municipal ferry, was working on the boat around 4:00 PM yesterday when a stray bullet suddenly flew towards him as the ferry approached the Qiujiang Wharf. The bullet struck Ding Miaoxiang in the head and exited, causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. He was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by the ship's officers. It is reported that his injuries are severe and his life may be in danger.

### Auto Drivers' Union Forms Traffic Service Corps

Due to the extraordinary tense situation, the Municipal Automobile Drivers' Union held an emergency meeting yesterday (the 13th). In addition to all the directors, more than one hundred drivers from various companies attended. Everyone was extremely enthusiastic about resisting the war. First, Chairman Du Weichang reported the purpose of the meeting and described the current critical situation in Shanghai. All attendees were enraged and ready for action. A traffic service corps was then formed, with the following organizational structure: ⑴ Liu Zhigang was appointed as the corps commander, and Wang Jiaan, Zhang Liansheng, and Zhao Youcai as deputy commanders to lead the corps members to serve at the front lines; ⑵ Zhu Weichang was appointed as the director of the corps' rear defense office; ⑶ recruitment of corps members was expanded; ⑷ corps members' wages would be one to two yuan per day, based on skill level. At that time, over one hundred people had already registered. It is reported that the matter has been reported to the Municipal Police Bureau, awaiting orders to depart. The people's enthusiasm for fighting the enemy together is evident.

### Central Savings Association's 17th Lottery Drawing

To Be Held on the 16th at the Pudong Native Association on Avenue Edward VII

The Central Savings Association has been established for just over a year, and its business has been exceptionally prosperous, with over one hundred thousand account holders and special prize money exceeding twenty-five thousand yuan. Because the original location on Hankou Road is no longer sufficient for office space, the Association has purchased a building at the corner of Tianjin Road and Jiangxi Road (the former site of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Bank) and will relocate its business there, effective immediately. A branch office will also be established at 609 Avenue Joffre to allow citizens residing in the southwestern district to conveniently join the Association and make payments. Furthermore, this period's lottery drawing will be changed to the Pudong Native Association on Avenue Edward VII and will be held publicly. Because the 15th falls on a Sunday, the drawing will be changed to Monday, the 16th, at 2:00 PM. This Saturday (the 14th) and Sunday (the 15th), both the new location on Tianjin Road and the branch office on Avenue Joffre will be open all day as usual.

### Letter

To the Editor: According to Mr. Wu Longji's representative, I have read the article titled "Local News: Ten Japanese Warships Sailed Out Yesterday" on page 9 of the third section of the 13th of this month's Shen Bao, which stated, "Foreman Wu Longji supervised laborers in storing 600 cases of poisonous gas bombs loaded from (Japanese) ships in the Huishan Wharf warehouse late at night." I was shocked by this false report. After investigating the matter, it has been found that I, Wu Longji, have been in the transportation business in Shanghai for more than thirty years, dealing exclusively with Chinese merchants. I have never done business with Japanese merchants. Although I have not received a high level of education, my love for my country is no less than that of others. During this time of national crisis, I would never do anything so outrageous. In addition to pursuing legal action, I am publishing this statement in the newspaper to clarify the truth. Therefore, I request that your esteemed lawyer send a letter to your newspaper to correct this false report in order to prevent malicious individuals from spreading rumors and harming legitimate merchants, causing patriots to be wrongly accused. I hope you will investigate and take appropriate action. Respectfully, to the Editor of the Local News section of the Shen Bao Newspaper, Lawyer Qiu Hanping, August 13, the 26th year.

### Elementary Thoughts on Air Defense

Since the advent of air forces, warfare has changed from a planar one to a three-dimensional one. That is to say, even if the defensive positions of the front lines are very strong, enemy planes can fly to important locations in the rear and carry out bombings, destroying our political centers, economic centers, damaging our factories, and destroying our transportation, causing serious damage to our spirits and material resources. Therefore, there is now a slogan that says, "Without air defense, there is no national defense." This is not an exaggeration.

Generally speaking, air defense can be divided into two types: active and passive. Active air defense is the responsibility of the military, while passive air defense requires all of our people to take on this responsibility together.

What is passive air defense? It means devising various methods to reduce damage when enemy planes come to bomb us. To be able to undertake this task, of course, one should receive very strict training. However, if a few common sense measures are taken, much of the damage can be reduced. I will write them down below.

1.  Light Control

If we have active air defense, enemy planes, in order to accomplish their missions, mostly attack at night. At that time, it is dark, and the lights of the city are their best compasses. Therefore, we should turn off all unnecessary lights early. Necessary lights should also be covered so that their light does not leak out. At the same time, the flames from chimneys and the light from iron smelting should all be covered. You should know that not concealing the light of one lamp can make the light control of the whole area ineffective. The most important thing to cover is the windows, using three layers of thick black cloth. The electric lights inside the room should also be wrapped on all sides with black cloth more than a foot long, so that the light can only shine downwards and not leak out. Moving lights, such as car lights, should be made into sleeves with metal products, and bicycle lights can be completely wrapped in black cloth. In short, no light should be visible to the planes.

2.  Firefighting

Using incendiary bombs to start fires is a vicious method of attacking cities by planes. If they are not extinguished immediately, major damage will be sustained. Of course, the fire department is relied upon to extinguish fires that occur at ordinary times, but if there are many places on fire, the fire department will be unable to attend to all of them. Therefore, everyone should move away things that are easily ignited in their homes. If you are unlucky enough to be hit by an incendiary bomb, you should extinguish it immediately before it causes a disaster. But you should be aware that incendiary bombs cannot be extinguished with water. Therefore, each family should prepare at least two loads of yellow sand and an iron shovel. When an incendiary bomb falls, use the shovel to pour the sand down on it. This is the best method of firefighting. At the same time, one or two people in each family should stay behind to be responsible for firefighting in their home. If a fire breaks out in a neighbor's house, you should also help as much as possible. If you cannot extinguish the fire, notify the fire department in a calm and quick manner.

3.  First Aid

If you are injured or poisoned, of course you should ask a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Before being sent to the hospital, it is best to disinfect the wound. If there is bleeding, you should also try to stop it. Speaking of the causes of bleeding, there are three types. One is a ruptured artery, in which the blood flows out very forcefully and is bright red. The second is a ruptured vein, in which the blood also flows out a lot, but it is more gradual and the blood is purple. This type of bleeding is very dangerous, because excessive bleeding can make it impossible to save the person. The third type is capillary bleeding, which is slow oozing. This type of bleeding is considered very minor. The method of stopping bleeding should be to first determine what type of bleeding it is. If it is arterial bleeding, then the fingers should be used to press down on the artery near the heart until no pulsing is felt -- for example, if there is bleeding in the calf, you should always press on the part of the leg near the knee. If it is venous bleeding, then it should be reversed, flattening the vein at the distal end. For capillary bleeding, use a disinfected object to press on the wound. After a short time, it can be stopped. Flattening the blood vessel requires greater force. After the bleeding is stopped, immediately tie it tightly with a tourniquet or bandage and send it to the hospital for treatment. What should be noted is that the blood vessel cannot be tied for more than two hours. Over a long period of time, the local area often becomes necrotic. The most common method of disinfection is to drip hydrogen peroxide into the wound, then gently wipe it clean with boric acid cotton wool, and then apply diluted iodine to the wound. After disinfection and hemostasis, it should be sent to the hospital immediately. If there are not enough stretchers, then a short ladder can be laid with cotton padding. There are many ways to make temporary stretchers, such as rattan mats and palm cushions. When carrying, be steady and quick, and avoid shocks as much as possible.

4.  Air Raid Warnings

Air raid warnings are signals to notify the people of what preparations to make. First, all sounds should be controlled to avoid misunderstandings. Second, everyone should be familiar with the various signals so as not to make mistakes. The symbols of the warnings are listed below.

Air Raid Warnings:

The air raid warning is sounded when enemy planes are approaching.

1.  Electric (steam) whistle: "Ooo-ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo..." ------------------

After sounding a long tone for twenty seconds, sound two short tones (three seconds in total) and then stop for two seconds, repeating this six times.

2.  Bell: ⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙ Dang, strike once, then strike twice, Dang, Dang, for three minutes.

An emergency warning is sounded when enemy planes are approaching closely.

1.  Electric (steam) whistle, Ooo-ooo, ooo, ooo ... ------------------......................................

Sounding a long tone for 30 seconds, followed by short tones several times for about a minute.

2.  Alarm, -⊙-⊙-⊙-⊙-⊙-⊙-⊙-Dang, Dang, Dang... strike rapidly and continuously for two minutes.

The all-clear is sounded when enemy planes have left.

1.  Electric (steam) whistle, Ooo----- continue to make a long sound for two minutes (once)

2.  Alarm, ⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙... Dangdangdangdangdang... Like this, strike separately one by one for two minutes.

There are two additional types of alerts that require special attention.

Poison Gas Alarm:

1.  Drumming (or knocking on a kerosene can) Dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong...

⊙ - ○ - ○ - ○ - ○ - ○ ...

Clatter, dong, dong, striking the drum three times, pausing briefly, then striking once again, continuing like this for two minutes.

2.  Flag Markings: During the day, the place where a yellow flag is inserted, or the place where a red light is lit at night, indicates an area contaminated by poison gas.

Fire Alarm:

Striking a gong randomly for two minutes. 5. Guarding

Generally speaking, guarding should be the responsibility of the military and police. However, in wartime, the military and police all go to the front to resist the enemy. So the responsibility for self-defense falls on the people themselves. Therefore, in peacetime, people should organize themselves, intensify training, and fully study military knowledge in order to complete their tasks.

6.  Poison Gas Protection

Poison gas is indeed a terrible thing, but if defended properly, it is not without a solution. Under the current conditions, it is impossible for everyone to have a gas mask and protective clothing as a practical matter. Simpler methods should be used more often, such as dissolving one or two ounces of sodium carbonate, four ounces of sodium hyposulfite, and one ounce of glycerin in a basin of hot water, soaking gauze wrapped in cotton wool in the solution, wringing it slightly, and covering the mouth and nose with it. This can also achieve the effect of protecting against poison gas. In very urgent situations, a wet towel or a towel soaked in urine can be used to temporarily prevent it. What should be noted is that when encountering poison gas, you should walk against the wind, not with the wind. As for digging air raid shelters and setting up poison gas-proof rooms, these are effective methods of collective poison gas protection. A poison gas-proof room is a room that is isolated from the outdoor air. The entrances and exits are separated by two thick curtains. Inside there are food and disinfectants. If there are many people in the room, there should also be equipment to supply fresh air.

7.  Traffic Control

Deaths and injuries from trampling each other are often greater than injuries from bombing. Therefore, traffic control is needed to maintain order and control all vehicles, so that people can evacuate easily and not hinder or harm protection work.

8.  Evacuation

The elderly, weak, women, and children should retreat to safer places during air raids. Those responsible for evacuation work should guide the people to the evacuation sites and routes and maintain order in the evacuation shelters. The best place to evacuate is, of course, the basement. If there is no basement, then you have to evacuate to an open space, or a designated school or public place. If the enemy releases poison gas, do not go to the woods, because the poison gas does not dissipate easily in those places. When going to the evacuation site, you must walk in order, do not rush ahead, and do not panic. You must understand that panic is useless, and the result of rushing ahead is to cause trampling.

The eight points above are all things that are easy to do. As long as we have a firm awareness and a spirit of hard work, we can definitely greatly reduce the damage from air raids. This is what we should encourage each other to do. At the same time, Shanghai is the first line of national defense. Once there is an international war, this city will bear the brunt. Therefore, we should actively prepare. Currently, there is a protection corps organization in this city that is recruiting brave members to organize training and prepare to take on the task of protection for the people. The people should enthusiastically participate.

### Weather Report

### Descendants of the Motherland

— Ma Jia

I remember that five months ago, the five consecutive Shikumen houses next to my house were all rented out, and a lot of machinery was moved in. A short guy with narrow eyes, but with eyeballs as sharp as a rat's, watched others moving this way and that way. He used a crude Jiangbei accent to order people to move things. I walked into the house and said to my wife:

"Oh dear! The house next door has been rented by the Japanese! And it's a factory, which is really troublesome!"

My wife frowned. We didn't dare to be "friendly neighbors" with the Japanese because, first, there had been trouble with Japanese neighbors, and second, my younger brother, because of the patriotic education he received at school, sang the "March of the Volunteers" or "Fight Back to Our Old Home" every day when he came home from school. And, in his simple mind, because he was receiving strong enemy education, he often gritted his teeth and cursed the Japanese. This made us worry a lot. When my younger brother came home from school, our whole family had persuaded him to be polite to our "neighbors" and not to cause any trouble that couldn't be cleaned up.

My younger brother was obedient and didn't provoke the children next door. He always went home when he saw them. The short, thin guy's wife was tall and fat, and didn't have any Japanese air about her. Our whole family was a little baffled by them.

But one day, the short guy came to my house and said to me in his crude Jiangbei accent:

"Sir! Could you lend me an abacus?"

"Yes! Yes!" I lent him the abacus.

After a while, he politely returned it to me. From then on, he often nodded to me when he saw me, and I, of course, smiled at him politely. His big, fat wife couldn't speak much Chinese, and his children could only speak Japanese. But they liked to play with the Chinese children in the alley, and the Chinese children always played with them in a mocking tone, constantly calling them: "Japanese kids! Japanese kids!"

Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, I have become even more cautious about that "neighbor." It's not that I'm afraid of them, but I'm afraid that even the smallest thing like a fly might be used by their government to extort a lot of money. One night, I was enjoying the cool air at the door. The short guy took a Japanese newspaper and walked up to me, saying:

"Sir! Sir! Chiang Kai-shek is going to send troops! Ah, ah!"

I saw that his face was full of happy smiles. I was very surprised, and my nerves made me feel that he was planning some trick on me. However, I politely moved a stool over and let him sit down. So I started talking to him.

I had never had such a "sincere talk" with him before. This conversation made me realize that he was not Japanese, he was Chinese. But he had lived in Japan for fifteen years. When he went to Japan, he was only about ten years old. Now, his boss (who is Japanese) has opened a small factory here. Because he is very loyal, they asked him to support them here. He has a monthly salary of eighty yuan. His wife is also Chinese (from Jiangbei). The children were born in Japan, so they can only speak Japanese, but his wife can't speak good Chinese, so she doesn't speak often.

I asked him why he could still speak Chinese. He said very seriously: "Chinese people will not forget Chinese!" I took the opportunity to ask him: "Then will you forget China?" His expression became even more serious, and he said, "How could I forget China?" He also told me that on the day Fengtai was recovered, he didn't know why, but he felt unspeakable happiness in his heart.

But his concepts were very vague because he had been heavily drugged. He said that China must merge with Japan, otherwise, it would be difficult for everyone to "do business." And he still believed that the four northeastern provinces were not in the hands of the Japanese because there was a "Xuantong Emperor" sitting on the dragon throne. I asked him again: "Since there is a Xuantong Emperor over there, why does Japan want to send troops over there?" I asked him again: "Why are Japanese soldiers fighting in North China? Isn't he trying to annex our China?" He listened to me and nodded repeatedly, saying, "Yes! Yes!" Finally, he said, "I didn't think about it properly in the past."

Later, he asked me to show him Chinese newspapers, but he didn't know many Chinese characters. I told him that we Chinese, whether government or people, are united and preparing for war. So he got excited, jumped up and asked, "Really?" I said to him, "I won't lie to you." At the same time, I asked him, "If China and Japan fight, who will you help?" He said without hesitation: "Of course I will be with the Chinese to fight the Japanese!"

He has been in Japan for fifteen years, but Chinese blood still flows in his veins! Ah! Descendants of the motherland, you will not forget the blood and soil of your ancestors! I was so moved that I shook his hand. In the past, I had doubts about him. Now, we are holding hands like brothers. (Author's note: Readers, don't treat this as an article. It is a true fact!)

### Defending the Marco Polo Bridge (6)

— Written by Chen He

While everyone was discussing this, someone was shouting on the bridgehead again. Everyone focused their attention on one side, and saw Ding Datou walking crookedly. His face was covered in blood, and his hands were also bloody. He muttered, "You hit, you hit... you hit! Anyway, it's over! It's over."

Li Wu: "Datou, what's wrong?"

Mr. Wang: "Was he beaten by the Japanese devils?"

Ding Datou seemed to have lost consciousness, waving his hands wildly in the air: "Japanese devils! Japanese devils! I... I'm not afraid of you... Give me the broadsword, I'll chop... you bunch of bastards..."

Ding Datou's two mu of soybeans were on the road. Naturally, they were ruined by the Japanese devils. Everyone looked at his crazy and manic behavior, so they pressed him down, calmed him down, and first sobered him up.

Li Wu: "How are we going to live?"

Mr. Wang then said: "Only if everyone rises up and drives them away - drives them out of our Chinese territory - then we can have peaceful days."

"Yes!" Mr. Wang clenched his fist: "As long as everyone is united, whether it's workers, farmers, or soldiers, let's all unite!"
