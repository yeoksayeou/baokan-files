[Hankou] The Japanese Concession suddenly declared martial law on the evening of the 5th.

Fortunately, our side remained calm and no incidents occurred. Upon inquiry by our authorities today, they claimed there had been a misunderstanding.

[Hankou] This afternoon, Japanese sailors on patrol in the Japanese Concession reinforced the sandbag defenses already built on various roads leading to the Chinese territory. Armored cars carrying numerous Japanese soldiers patrolled the roads and guarded key points, immediately creating a tense situation. Chinese soldiers were also stationed behind newly constructed sandbag defenses in the Chinese territory and at the concrete defenses built near intersections adjacent to the Japanese Concession. Meanwhile, the last group of approximately 400 women and children of Japanese residents were scheduled to sail to Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. Foreign residents in and near the Japanese Concession received warnings to evacuate immediately. Chinese people also flocked into the Chinese Special District. Consulates of various countries prepared for emergencies, having selected assembly points for their respective nationals. However, no incidents have occurred yet. Between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM last night, Japanese soldiers in the Japanese Concession conducted defense drills, with all lights extinguished, causing widespread panic. Chinese officers guarding the nearby Special District, unaware of the reason, immediately dispatched additional soldiers to guard the defenses and took other precautionary measures. Residents in the vicinity were alarmed for an hour until everything returned to normal around midnight. It is reported that the Japanese authorities had notified the Chinese authorities in advance about the drills, but due to miscommunication, this information was not relayed to the Special District. A reporter from the English-language Chu Pao interviewed the Japanese Consul General, who stated that the Japanese Commander-in-Chief had recently met with He Chengjun, the Pacification Director. Both parties stated that they had no intention of attacking the other. The Japanese army is now under orders from Tokyo to abide by the Cabinet's decision and not provoke any incidents. When the reporter asked if the Japanese army would defend the Japanese Concession if the Chinese army attempted to occupy it, the Japanese Consul General replied that, of course, they would defend it, and that there was no doubt about it.

Commentary

### Encourage National Spirit, Do Not Let It Decline

— Hua

Recently, the war situation in North China has been relatively calm. Some say, "This is the calm before the storm." We hope this is true. The enemy has occupied our land and is carrying out massacres in Tianjin and Peking while also using aircraft to demonstrate by dropping bombs. This dangerous and terrifying situation is unbearable for us. How can our ancient cultural cities and bustling ports remain under the enemy's trampling feet for long? Therefore, the current temporary calm in the North China war situation can only be hoped to be extremely temporary. This temporary calm should be quickly broken, and the situation that unfolds afterward must be our full-scale resistance against the enemy, driving them out of our territory.

However, there is a dangerous phenomenon currently: after the war situation has become calm, the national spirit is gradually declining. Various factors are contributing to this trend, and we must pay close attention to it. Among these factors, the most obvious are the following points: ㊀ When people discuss the current crisis, they often describe our country as weak, seemingly unable to resist the enemy. This kind of negative argument can indirectly enhance the arrogance of the aggressors and is very dangerous. ㊁ Others talk about our resistance, saying that even if it entails extreme sacrifice, even the devastation of a large part of our territory is acceptable. While this can express our determination to fight to the death on the one hand, on the other, it inevitably exaggerates the enemy's destructive power, indirectly affecting the will of our soldiers and civilians to resist the enemy. ㊂ Recently, in cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai, a large number of residents have relocated. This phenomenon, called a wartime preparation, may not be entirely wrong. However, excessive and rushed population movements can spread rumors everywhere. At this time, the enemy and traitors take the opportunity to stir up trouble, causing people who do not know the truth to become agitated before even resisting the enemy. As a result, this benefits the enemy and does not help our country's preparations for resistance.

The above three points are just a few of the most easily seen examples. The only lesson we learn from this situation is that if the calm war situation is prolonged, it will weaken the national spirit, and once the national spirit is weakened, there can be no more fighting. However, at this last juncture we are tolerating, it has long been exceeded: if China does not resist, it will not be able to survive. And if we want to fight, we should do our best to maintain and encourage the national spirit, so that it does not decline.

The current gathering of most military and political leaders in the capital is a good sign. The active deployment of anti-Japanese support in various places is also an urgent task. These messages, used to publicize to the masses, are enough to inspire everyone. In addition, if there are more concrete facts indicating the definite unfolding of the war against Japan, enhancing our country's grasp of victory, they should be quickly disseminated so that the entire nation can be firm and calm, not afraid of any sacrifice. After the full-scale war of resistance is launched, we will surely be able to gain the final victory with the greatest courage.

### How Should We Resist the Enemy and Save the Nation?

—Vice Chairman Feng's Broadcast Address— Accurate Estimation of the Enemy Required. Clear Understanding of Anti-Japanese Policies Required. Promote the National Spirit of Resistance. Implement a Strong and Protracted War.

[Nanjing] Vice Chairman Feng delivered a speech on the Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 6th, starting at 8 PM, entitled "How Should We Resist the Enemy and Save the Nation?" The original text is as follows:

Fellow compatriots, today, our national enemy, Japanese imperialism, has once again occupied our Tianjin and Peking with military force, massacring our compatriots. Now, along the Pinghan Railway, Jinpu Railway, and PingSui Railway, they are bombing everywhere. It has truly reached the final moment of our nation's survival. I have seen and heard that none of our compatriots are not angered by the enemy's atrocities, and all are considering how to fight for the survival of the nation. We see them sacrificing their lives to resist the enemy's attack. Although the result of the war is that we have temporarily suffered small defeats, all these performances have proved that we can resist the enemy and save the country, and guarantee that we can achieve the final victory of the War of Resistance. Therefore, today I am here to talk to you about the question of "How Should We Resist the Enemy and Save the Nation?" Our government's attitude towards the enemy has been clearly and thoroughly announced to the world by Chairman Chiang several times, that is, we take the inviolability of the sovereignty of Tianjin and Peking and North China as the final juncture of our temporary endurance. Therefore, now, unless Japanese imperialism thoroughly repents and returns all the territories and sovereignty it has seized, we can only fight for the survival of the country, and we can only realize Chairman Chiang's proposition to resist the enemy. Speaking of how to resist the enemy and save the country, we can divide it into three points. First, how should we correctly estimate the enemy? We can divide this into two points. ㊀ For six years, the enemy has been constantly invading our country, especially the recent attacks and bombings by the enemy at Lugouqiao and Tianjin, which have finally shattered the illusion of a few people that Japanese imperialism's aggression still has a limit. On the other hand, these tragic facts inevitably arouse some compatriots to mistakenly regard all Japanese people as enemies. We must know that it is Japanese imperialism that is invading China, and it is the Japanese warlords who are fierce and brutal. As for the Japanese people, I believe that most of them still love peace and uphold justice and righteousness. I believe that one day they will join hands with us to punish their rampant warlords and overthrow their imperialist politics. However, we should never have any illusions about Japanese imperialism and the warlords. Only when they are destroyed under the iron and blood of our revolutionary war can they rein in their insatiable ambitions and recognize the justice and righteousness of the world. ㊁ Some of us also overestimate the enemy's strength and underestimate our own strength. The reason why they overestimate the enemy's strength is, on the one hand, that they overestimate the effectiveness of the enemy's artillery, and on the other hand, they believe that Japan can use despicable means of threats and inducements to buy many people among our people to become tools. Regarding the effectiveness of artillery in modern warfare, we will explain it in detail later. Now, taking the war in Lugouqiao as an example, this was an action that the enemy had deliberately planned for at least one or two months. Why have they not captured it after attacking for two weeks and suffering casualties ranging from five hundred to three thousand people? From this, it can be seen that as long as our generals and soldiers are loyal, brave, patriotic, and not afraid of sacrifice, and are reasonably prepared, they can resist the enemy's superior weapons and strike at the enemy's pretentious and reckless actions. Similarly, the failure of our Pingnan War was due to the enemy's concentration of forces and numbers, but also to our own insufficient preparation. Otherwise, the enemy would not have succeeded so easily. For example, the enemy had long regarded the generals of the 29th Army as tools that could be disposed of at will. However, when Song Zheyuan reached a critical juncture, he had to fight back regardless of everything. The officers and soldiers of the 29th Army had to be loyal, brave, and fight hard. Therefore, the deaths of thousands of people in the 29th Army this time were truly valuable. They deserve to be revolutionary soldiers of the Shen Kingdom. Furthermore, the security team under the puppet organization of eastern Hebei, which was created by Japan, killed more than 200 Japanese soldiers in Tongzhou and raised the banner of resisting the enemy in one day because of Zhang Qingyu and the soldiers' sudden turn to righteousness. From this, it can be seen that the internal contradictions in our country created and hoped for by the enemy will inevitably stand on the anti-Japanese front together to save the crisis at the critical moment of national life and death. The martial power boasted by Japan is not invincible. Moreover, what we have now is only the outpost battle. If a full-scale protracted war is launched, their internal problems will be even more and bigger. ㊂ On the other hand, some people underestimate the enemy's strength, thinking that as long as our army fights back, the enemy will be defeated. This is also an unrealistic idea, because the national revolutionary war is not simply about the excellence of weapons, but we must at least have determination, planning, and preparation. We must avoid the enemy's strengths, attack their weaknesses, and use our strengths to attack their weaknesses. Because there are many contradictions within the enemy, and the soldiers all have the psychology of shrinking back, fearing death, and not wanting to fight, but these internal problems and contradictions can only be fully exposed under our long-term war of resistance and counterattack. In short, it is wrong to overestimate or underestimate the enemy's strength. If you overestimate it, the conclusion is only to wait to be a slave to the country, or to willingly be a traitor. If you underestimate it, you will inevitably suffer many unnecessary failures and losses, which will only increase the enemy's arrogance. Therefore, our correct estimation of the enemy should be that the enemy's material power is not terrible, and we will surely be able to defeat it. The condition for this inevitable victory is our nation's firm determination, detailed and concrete plans, the fullest possible preparation, and a sustained and large-scale war of resistance. Second, how should we correctly understand the policy of resisting the enemy? The reason why we are now implementing the War of Resistance is entirely forced upon us by our enemy. We do not love peace, precisely because we loved peace too much in the past, so we became the object of Japanese imperialism's relentless aggression. Now, only by means of resistance can we achieve true peace and enable all nations of the world to gain the rights to equal and free survival and development. Therefore, our resolute resistance is not to die and be done with it, preserving one's personal integrity and national integrity, and thinking that is enough, but to seek the permanent survival of countless people by sacrificing a few people. We are not destroying our nation and national construction, so that even if the enemy occupies all of China, they will gain nothing, but in the enemy's invasion, we will completely drive the enemy out by means of our tenacious resistance, whether in places that have not been or have already been invaded by the enemy, and achieve national freedom and equality. Our confidence in this final victory is by no means an illusion, but a lesson. President Sun Zhongshan once analyzed the Wuchang Uprising, explaining this principle. He said, "There was a Xiong Bingkun, a platoon leader in the New Army. Seeing that the opportunity was pressing and the party members were being searched, if I did not strike first, I would be controlled and put to death. It is better to strike quickly rather than wait for death. He told his comrades this idea, but they all said they had no bullets. Later, Xiong Bingkun borrowed two boxes of bullets from a retired friend, and distributed them to his comrades. The revolutionary weapons relied on only this number. As soon as the gunshots started, the artillery battalion responded first, and Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao fled one after another, and Wuchang fell into the hands of the revolutionaries. The Qing side had many troops, and they were fully equipped with ammunition. When news of the revolution spread, Rui Cheng discussed it with a consul of a certain country, saying that if something happened in Hubei, he would ask them to send warships to help. The arrangements were so meticulous, and the joint forces were so strong, but they were broken by the revolutionaries with two boxes of bullets. Think about it, two boxes of bullets, at most fifty bullets. Even if they all hit, they could only kill fifty enemies. How could they break Wuchang? I think what broke Wuchang was the spirit of the revolutionaries. The art of war says, 'Seize the initiative by making a noise.' The so-called 'noise' is the spirit. Based on this, the power of material is small, and the power of spirit is great. This can be decided in the Wuchang campaign." This is just based on our own country, and there is already this precedent. Let me talk about a foreign country. Previously, an Italian, named Garibaldi, was a famous revolutionary. He did not have any weapons or abilities. When he crossed the sea to attack the city, he held out against 30,000 enemies with 1,000 men for four or five days, and finally attacked the city from another path. Whether in strategy or tactics, he could not have won, but the facts were so different. What do you mean by winning with less against more? It is directly the spirit winning over material." This passage of instruction is what we should remember today. Today's Japanese imperialism, its fighting power is far better than the Qing government, but our existing weapons are also far better than the revolutionary army in the Xinhai Revolution. Moreover, we have a great national spirit, while Japanese imperialism is like Russia during the Russo-Japanese War, with no spirit to speak of. Therefore, the result of this Sino-Japanese war is that as long as we thoroughly resist, the loser must be Japan, and the final victor must be our country. Third, how should we implement the War of Resistance and save the country? Judging from what has been said above, we have about three points regarding how to resist the enemy and save the country: ㊀ Promote our national spirit of resistance, such as A, Yin Ziwu who ruined his family to help the country, being public and not private, and B, Shen Baoxu's being loyal to the country and not to his family. First of all, we must get rid of many bad ideas, such as selfishness, dishonesty, fear of death, loyalty to the family but not to the country, and self-preservation. If these concepts are not completely eradicated, leaving no trace of slavery, we should now scrape off the dirt and polish it up, replace "selfishness" with "public," replace "dishonesty" with "honesty," replace "fear of death" with "sacrifice," and replace "dying peacefully in bed" with "dying in battle." If everyone can only know the public and not the private, be loyal to the country and the nation, disregard the family, and sacrifice the lives of the small self to exchange for the lives of the great national self, then our country will surely be able to obtain a free and equal position from the oppression of Japanese imperialism. For example, the resistance wars of Turkey and the Soviet Union are the best examples of achieving victory through the national spirit of resistance. ㊁ We must know that the conduct of the War of Resistance is a long-term, arduous, and huge task. In addition to contributing our bodies to fight on the battlefield, we should also contribute our money and property to the country to be used as all necessary war expenses. Recently, I heard that after the Lugouqiao Incident, the citizens of Japan, which is an aggressor, donated 1 million yuan and 500,000 yuan to the country. We are the invaded country, and we are the people at the last juncture of life and death. Therefore, we should be even more eager to help the country than the enemy. Everyone should contribute a large part of all the money they have to the country, so that we will naturally not be afraid of financial difficulties, and we will not be afraid that we will not have new weapons to resist the enemy. The War of Resistance is undoubtedly a huge war of attrition. Our people should redouble their efforts to produce supplies for the War of Resistance, redouble their efforts to save for the War of Resistance, and not supply raw materials and private supplies to the enemy, but completely concentrate the goods obtained from austerity and production into the hands of the country. In this way, our War of Resistance can be sustained, and our strength can be increased. Recently, the enemy has already implemented the seventh conscription in their country and increased war expenses by 450 million yuan, and also announced that they will send 28 divisions to attack our country. In 1915, Japan once intimidated Yuan Shikai by mobilizing troops, causing him to completely recognize the Twenty-One Demands it proposed. Compatriots, now is not the era of that traitorous government. We must mobilize 450 million people to respond to their mobilization of 28 divisions. We must contribute our spirit, money, and material resources to the War of Resistance to strike at our enemies with a desperate fight. There is no so-called truth and peace in the world now. Whoever has the greatest strength, truth and peace are on that side. Now is the final moment for all of us to sacrifice all our spiritual and material things for justice, for survival, for peace, for the country, for the nation, for ourselves, and for our children and grandchildren. Everyone must rise up and participate in the War of Resistance in order to survive, otherwise they will perish. President Sun Zhongshan taught us, "There was a high official in Annam who lived in Hanoi, named Huang Gaoqi. Before Annam was conquered, he had served as prime minister, so he had been promoted to high office and made a lot of money. Because he was very rich, he had a lot of property in Hanoi, and the garden in his house was also very beautiful. But now that Annam is conquered, even if he had been a high official and made a lot of money, he would still be a slave to France. If the country is conquered, he would be a slave to foreigners. Even if he had been promoted to high office like Huang Gaoqi and made a lot of money like Huang Gaoqi, what honor would he have if people did not scold him as a slave to the conquered country? The survival of the country has a great relationship with our people. If the country is strong, everyone will be honored. If the country is weak, everyone will be ashamed." This passage of instruction from President Sun Zhongshan is also the opinion I am contributing to you today. I hope that all the people of the country will, under the unified leadership of the government, implement a strong and sustained anti-Japanese national revolutionary war. The enemy is not to be feared, and small failures once or twice are not to be worried about. As long as all of us continue to resist more and more fiercely, victory will always be ours.

### Kong Xiangxi and Gu Weijun Meet with French Prime Minister Xu Dan

Kong says China is ready to fight for survival. Gu says Japan's actions are completing the Tanaka Plan.

[Paris] Chinese Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, accompanied by Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, visited French Prime Minister Xu Dan today to discuss the Far Eastern situation. (National Telegram, 6th)

[Paris] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, arrived here this morning from London and will stay until the 7th of this month before proceeding to Berlin and Prague. He told reporters from Havas that regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, "If the countries of Western Europe want to prevent war in the Far East, they may still be able to do so. Most of the public opinion in Europe and the United States is sympathetic to China, and I am very pleased. I also firmly believe that if the rulers and people of Japan can accept world opinion, its influence will not only save China and Japan from war, but also save the countries of the world from catastrophe. China is now defending its independence and is determined to repay violence with violence. The current stalemate is obviously a struggle between aggressive war and the forces of peace. China will not only fight for its own survival, but also for world justice and righteousness." Regarding the withdrawal of the 29th Army of China from Beiping and Tianjin, Vice President Kong said that rumors in Western countries that General Song Zheyuan had betrayed the country were untrue. In fact, Mr. Song trusted the Japanese garrison authorities too much. The Japanese army had made solemn promises, and Mr. Song believed them without doubt, only to be deceived by Japan. Vice President Kong's visit to France is not of an official nature, but he began negotiations on various economic and financial issues with financial circles in Paris before going to the United States last month. Negotiations will continue within days to seek solutions. In addition, Mr. Kong will defend China's position in the Sino-Japanese dispute. (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)

[Paris] Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun recently told reporters from "Strong Newspaper" that "Japan's current actions are a step to complete the Tanaka Plan. Japan has long coveted mineral resources and farmland in North China, but the cooperation of a nation can never be achieved by bayonets. In particular, economic cooperation cannot be achieved by force. At this point, a serious conflict between China and Japan is inevitable. After the start of the war, we will continue to resist until the last breath. As for the outcome of the conflict, there are only two possibilities: either peace-loving and respected countries will come forward to intervene strongly, or the aggressor country will go bankrupt financially and economically. It is true that the countries of the world have their own serious difficulties, but acts of military aggression, no matter where they come from, directly endanger international peace and the security of all nations. This is also something we must not forget." Ambassador Gu Weijun then explained the causes of the current Sino-Japanese conflict, saying that Japan claimed it wanted to enter Wanping County to search for missing Japanese soldiers, but was refused by the Chinese defense forces, so it opened fire on the city. An attack. An exercise of the Japanese army in the area of Wanping City violated the Xin Chou Treaty which clearly prohibited it. This was the first step in Japan's provocation. A few weeks ago, when incidents occurred between Japanese and Russian groups on the Heilongjiang River, Japan's intention was to test the reaction of the Soviet Union. As a result, the Soviet Union's attitude was extremely compromising. Japan then believed that it could implement its aggressive plan against China. However, in recent years, China has made rapid and obvious progress in politics, economy, and military affairs, and Japan will not be able to do whatever it wants." (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)

### China Issues Bonds in London

Britain Agrees in Principle - London Newspapers Take Notice

[London] Britain's agreement in principle to China's issuance of £20 million in bonds in London is highly valued by newspapers here. However, it reiterated that the bonds were not immediately available. Various parties are inquiring about the details of the matter with the Chinese Embassy and banks with headquarters in the Far East. According to the Financial News, unless the political situation in the Far East becomes clearer, there is no room for the necessary conditions for borrowing from China. The newspaper also stated that the British Treasury is very concerned about the loan, as it is part of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's plan to help China improve its financial and economic situation. The newspaper further stated that part of the loan would be used to develop transportation, and a large amount of machinery and equipment would be purchased from the United Kingdom. In addition, the Birmingham Post published an editorial today saying that the intention of this loan agreement is sufficient to show that some countries, including the United States, will disregard Japan's intentions and decide to provide practical assistance to the Nanjing government so that the Chinese nation can stand on its own. This is something to be congratulated for China. Furthermore, creditors must know for sure the purpose of the loan, which should be of a definite non-military nature and should be conducive to China's social and economic situation. They must also obtain a direct and fairly practical right in China's economic interests and the consolidation of the current Chinese government, so that aggressive countries will have to pay attention.

[Tokyo] The general meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee opened at 1:25 PM this afternoon. After Finance Minister Kaya explained the supplementary budget and other proposals, Mr. Tobu rose to ask whether the current budget included the calculation of extensive local expenses. Minister of the Army Sugiyama replied that if the Chinese army advanced, he would have to abandon the policy of non-escalation of the situation. However, he is still proceeding as much as possible with the previous policy.

Mr. Miwa Hisao (Shadai) asked whether the diplomatic negotiations for the North China Incident should be the sole responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Shouldn't it be transferred to national diplomacy? What does the authorities think?

Foreign Minister Hirota replied that diplomatic work must be carried out with the support of the people and in accordance with the thinking of the people.

Miwa asked again whether there was any official report on the China-UK co-loan situation.

Foreign Minister Hirota replied that he had heard that the railway loan had been established, but had not yet received a report on the so-called £20 million loan.

Miwa asked again whether the spirit of the Japan-Germany Anti-Communist Agreement could be developed for treaties in the Orient.

Foreign Minister Hirota replied that, citing the spirit of the Japan-Germany Anti-Communist Agreement, he plans to establish contact with Italy, France, and the United Kingdom in the future.

At this point, the questioning ended, and everyone stood up to approve the fourth supplementary budget. The meeting adjourned at 3:55 PM. (Domei News Agency, 6th)

[Tokyo] The Nichinichi Shimbun reported that Foreign Minister Hirota told members of the Diet today that it was difficult to find a satisfactory solution to the North China situation. He hoped that the Japanese army was currently proceeding in order to achieve a fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese relations in North China. If China joins the German-Japanese Anti-Communist Agreement to eliminate communism in the East, peace in East Asia can be ensured. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)

### German Advisors in China

German Political Circles Consider Recall

[Berlin] German political circles are currently considering whether to recall all German military advisors in China. If the current conflict between China and Japan continues and the German military advisors remain in China, Japan may regard this as an unfriendly move. In short, Germany is willing to maintain absolute neutrality in the dispute between China and Japan. Although the military advisors in China are hired in a private capacity, they are all German citizens and are subject to the power of the German government. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)

### British Plan for World Peace - Five Steps

Seeking to Improve Relations with Italy and Germany - Eden to Visit Rome Next Month

[London] German Foreign Minister Neurath and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano are likely to visit London in mid-September. However, British Foreign Secretary Eden may visit Rome first. If this development proceeds smoothly, the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany can sign a treaty to maintain peace in Europe. It is understood that the current plan has about the following five steps: ㊀ Eliminate misunderstandings between Britain and Italy, ㊁ Improve relations between Britain and Germany, including the signing of a new Locarno Treaty or Germany's return to the League of Nations, ㊂ Eliminate the threat of the Spanish Civil War to world peace, at least withdraw a part of the foreign volunteers, but at the same time recognize the Spanish National Army as a belligerent group, ㊃ Britain and Japan conclude a political agreement to stabilize the situation in the Far East. Before the establishment of this agreement, it is of course conditional on the absence of a long-term conflict between China and Japan, ㊄ Britain and the United States conclude a commercial agreement. (National Telegram, 5th)

[London] Regarding the question of reconciliation between Britain and Italy, people in London believe that the two sides have decided to conduct negotiations in Rome in early September to discuss in detail the principles agreed upon by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in their recent exchanges of letters. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)

[Rome] According to an observer, the prospects for negotiations between Britain and Italy will inevitably lead France to participate in the matter, which should also be supported in France. According to Italian newspapers, the controversy against France has stopped for a long time, which makes it easier to improve relations between France and Italy. Those in charge believe that if the tense relations between France and Italy can be eased, the negotiations between Britain and Italy will also be greatly facilitated, and the rapprochement between Britain and Italy will be enough to divert the political axis formed by Germany and Italy, which should be welcomed by France. Those in charge also said that recently, public opinion in Britain and Italy has undergone the necessary evolution, which has led to closer relations between the two countries. In the future, the diplomatic authorities of the major European countries may reach an agreement within the possible scope. This agreement may be called the New Locarno Treaty or the Four-Power Pact of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. In short, the purpose is to promote the stability of peace in Europe.

### West European Convention Issues

Germany and Italy Support British Proposal - Organize Expert Committee to Study

[London] The British government recently sent notes to the governments of France, Germany, and Italy on the matter of the future West European Convention, advocating the organization of a committee of experts in London to study it. British diplomatic circles recently announced that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received reports from British envoys to Germany and Italy stating that Germany and Italy have expressed their support and are willing to send experts to London. However, Italy insists on two demands: ㊀ Britain must first recognize Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia, ㊁ The expert committee must have political power. On this level, Germany advocates that the expert committee should be limited to a purely technical nature in accordance with the British proposal. (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)

[Berlin] The "Berliner Tageblatt" stated that Germany, Italy, Britain, and France are the four major powers in Europe, and their interests are intertwined. If they can link the two groups that maintain the status quo and break the status quo and lay a solid foundation for peace in Central and Western Europe, all countries will benefit. The West European policy, rather than the first after-the-war policy of France, has caused war fronts in Eastern Europe, and the establishment of a peace system remains a problem to be solved. If the four major powers in Europe can trust each other, there will be no shortage of opportunities for cooperation. There are currently four major issues that must be resolved in the process from maintaining the status quo to peaceful improvement of the status quo: ㊀ Equality in armaments, ㊁ Economic cooperation, ㊂ Ethnic minorities, ㊃ Mandated territories. If these problems can be dealt with in a constructive manner, they will be easier to solve. (Haitong Telegram, 6th)

### German and Hungarian Foreign Ministers to Meet with Austrian Authorities

### The Soviet Union Insists on its Original Position on the Spanish Question

Opposes Recognizing Spanish Belligerents - Non-Intervention Committee Adjourns

[London] The Sub-Committee of the Non-Intervention Committee has now decided to adjourn and wait for a new convening. In addition, a committee of experts has been organized and will begin to investigate the means of maritime and land surveillance. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)

[London] Regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, after negotiations were held by the governments of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy yesterday, it was reported that an agreement was to be concluded by the four governments outside the Coordinating Committee, agreeing that after the foreign volunteers in Spain had been substantially withdrawn, the two parties involved in the civil war in the country would be recognized as belligerent groups. This agreement excludes the Soviet Union and may be submitted for discussion at a meeting of the sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee this week. The Soviet Union has always maintained its previous position, which is, in fact, equivalent to refusing to recognize the Spanish National Army as a belligerent group. However, the Soviet Union agrees that this issue can be resolved by other countries concerned outside the Coordinating Committee, and the Soviet Union will not participate in the signing. For this reason, the issue of recognizing belligerent groups will be separated from the compromise plan proposed by Britain, and Russia will be excluded and resolved by other countries in its place. As for the other parts of the compromise plan, they will still be used as the basis for concluding a general agreement. It is not yet known whether Germany and Italy will accept this new plan, but according to this new plan, Germany and Italy should no longer use Russia's opposition to recognizing belligerent groups as a reason to advocate the revocation of the two laws of Britain and France. If so, it is not hopeless to establish a compromise between the two extreme propositions. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)

### Russian Newspaper Comments on Japan's Ambitions

Strongly Criticizes British and American Connivance

[Moscow] Izvestia stated, "At the beginning of the North China Incident, some rulers in Britain and the United States ignored the signs of the incident and deliberately underestimated the meaning contained in it, calling it a 'local incident' that often occurs. This position, of course, suits the Japanese bandits' intentions. They know that the United States has adopted a policy of isolation and does not actively strive for peace, and that Britain continues to make concessions and compromises, so they recklessly launch an all-out resolute offensive. 'Some people in the ruling classes of the world powers, especially Britain, still hope that Japan's aggression against North China can take another direction, at least temporarily no longer continue to advance towards Central China, South China, and the Pacific Ocean. Recent developments have proved that this illusion is completely wrong. On the one hand, Japan sees that Britain and the United States do not effectively oppose it, and on the other hand, it has practically experienced that there are many difficulties in the 'other direction', so it decides to continue to advance in the direction of the weakest resistance, penetrate deep into the interior of China, and prepare for large-scale provocations against Central China and South China, directly infringing on British interests. At the same time, recent events have also proved that Japanese imperialism will never be satisfied with annexing China, and its intention is to turn China into a training ground to create favorable conditions for a new war of redistribution.' 'Judging from the recent situation, it is even more surprising that Mr. Eden has invited Germany and Italy to jointly mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict. This is like seeing the victim being strangled by a robber, but not only sitting idly by, but also urging other accomplices who specialize in robbery to take up the task of occupying Manchuria. It has proved that it is useless to beg Japanese imperialism to lay down its butcher knife and restore its reason, and it is also futile to expect the Japanese warlords to respect international obligations. The truth is completely clear that any isolated policy that refuses to strive for peace together, any policy of non-interference in Japanese aggression, any policy of concession and compromise before the Japanese bandits, will only promote their more reckless aggression and increase the danger of world war. The Japanese warlords only recognize one authority, that is, the authority of force. If they want to stop the atrocities of the Japanese warlords and avoid world war, they can only establish an effective international peace organization, and only by uniting the countries of the world that are willing to strive for peace and actively fighting for peace can they achieve practical results.'

### Anti-Enemy Support Association Cables, Urging Stop to Residents of Neighboring Counties Moving to Shanghai

Cables Sent to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments Ordering Subordinates to Handle - Concessions Are Not Paradise, No Need to Move Here

The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association yesterday cabled the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments, stating: "Regarding the recent influx of residents from counties near Shanghai along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, seeking to avoid war, the population of Shanghai is already at its peak. Residents of Zhabei have mostly moved south to the concessions, and housing is already a problem. If residents from nearby counties continue to move in, food shortages will inevitably occur. Shanghai is the largest coastal city in China, and considering the tragedy of Tianjin, Shanghai is unlikely to escape unscathed. The concessions are by no means a paradise on earth. Even from a safety perspective, Shanghai is far inferior to the inland areas. Therefore, it is not advisable for residents of your province to move to Shanghai. We hereby request your government to order the county governments near Shanghai to use effective measures to prevent residents from migrating to Shanghai, to maintain order and avoid displacement. We earnestly hope for this." Addressed to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Zhejiang Provincial Government.

### Xiao Zhenying Returns to China Yesterday

Wen Yingxing Arrives in Shanghai on the Same Flight, Yang Hu and Others Greet Him

Xiao Zhenying, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and former mayor of Tianjin, traveled abroad with Minister Kong in April to inspect industries in Europe and America. Recently, upon hearing of the tense situation in North China and the imminent outbreak of all-out war, he immediately cut short his inspection, transferred from England to America, and took a postal airline flight back to China. He arrived at Longhua Airport yesterday at 4:20 PM on a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Hong Kong.

After arriving in Shanghai, he will stay in Shanghai for one night and then proceed to Nanjing to meet with the authorities. The decision on when to go north will be made after arriving in Nanjing. Regarding his inspection abroad, because the time was very short, what he gained was limited. However, he deeply felt that the progress of science and material construction in Europe and America in recent years is truly astonishing. Our country should strive to catch up urgently, which is also a key point in saving the country. Detailed information will be drafted into a report soon and submitted to the government for reference. According to Wen Yingxing, he accompanied Minister Kong abroad and, after attending the coronation ceremony of the British monarch in England, inspected the army in Europe. Because the national situation is urgent and he is a soldier with a military position, he decided to return to the motherland from the United States by plane.

### Ningxing and Daxing Ships Safely Arrive in Ningbo Amidst Hurricane

Huaxing Radio Station Erroneously Broadcast Sinking News, Announcer Sent to Police Station Requesting Exemption from Prosecution

The Ningxing, a passenger ship of the Sanbei Company on the Ningbo route, departed Shanghai for Ningbo on Thursday at 5:00 PM with over 40 passengers. After 11:00 PM that night, the Huaxing Radio Station in Shanghai suddenly broadcast a report stating that the Ningxing ship, after leaving Shanghai, encountered a hurricane in the waters of Dajishan, the ship sank, and all passengers drowned. After the spread of this shocking news, the families of the ship's crew and passengers, believing that the radio station's broadcast must be accurate, many women rushed to Wharf No. 2 on the Bund that night and wept bitterly at the Huangpu River. Until 6:00 or 7:00 AM yesterday, a large group of men and women, young and old, went to the Sanbei Company to inquire about the truth. The people at the company said that there was no such thing, and where did this shocking rumor come from? The people said that the Huaxing Radio Station had already broadcast it, and the company was trying to deceive the public. The company then announced to the public the telegram that the Ningxing ship had already arrived in Zhenhai, but the people still did not believe it, and more and more people came. The company then sent another telegram to inquire and received a reply from Ningbo stating that the Ningxing ship had arrived safely in Ningbo at 8:00 AM. The original telegram was posted, and the people finally believed it and gradually left. The Sanbei authorities then summoned the announcer of the Huaxing Radio Station to the company and questioned him as to why he broadcast the rumor and where the information came from. The announcer replied that it came from a telephone report. The company then asked why he did not inquire with the company to verify the information before broadcasting it, which was intentionally malicious. After consulting with lawyer Jiang Yiping at the company, the announcer was detained at the police station pending punishment. In the afternoon, the Huaxing Radio Station repeatedly pleaded with Sanbei, willing to publish an apology in the newspaper today, stating that it was due to mishearing a telephone report, and requesting exemption from prosecuting the announcer. Sanbei, after the station's earnest pleading, has agreed to a peaceful resolution.

Also, the Daxing ship of the Daxing Company, which originally ran the Wenzhou-Taizhou route, recently changed to the Ningbo route because the Hongxing ship was being repaired. This ship departed Shanghai for Ningbo on the 3rd of this month. After leaving Shanghai, there was no news. Rumors of its misfortune have spread throughout Shanghai. Because there was no radio equipment on board, it was impossible to inquire about its whereabouts. All parties in Shanghai have been deeply concerned about the whereabouts of this ship in recent days, fearing that it had encountered an accident. Until yesterday afternoon, the company received a telegram from the ship, reporting that it had arrived safely in Ningbo. The company then informed all sectors, and the people were greatly relieved.

The Hongshun ship of the Datongxing Company, which was heading to Shashi on the Upper Yangtze River, encountered a hurricane outside the Wusongkou on the morning of the 5th. Fortunately, it dropped anchor early to take shelter. However, the wind and waves were too strong, and the anchor chain broke. A large iron anchor was lost at sea. Fortunately, the ship was not damaged. A telegram has been sent to Shanghai yesterday stating that the ship has set sail for the Yangtze River.

### General Labor Union and Municipal Chamber of Commerce Discuss Wartime Production Control Yesterday

Urging Major Industries to Intensify Production, Letter Sent to Banking Industry to Continue Lending and Regulating

The Shanghai General Labor Union, considering that the survival of the nation has reached a final juncture, and in order to concentrate the strength of all workers in Shanghai and prepare to contribute to the country, specially invited the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China Industrial Federation, the National Goods Factory Federation, the Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, and other organizations at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss issues such as wartime industrial production control in Shanghai. Over 20 people attended. Chairman Zhou Xuexiang reported that in this extraordinary period, industrial production must be strictly controlled. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "Wartime is like peacetime, and peacetime is like wartime." Therefore, we should ensure that various important productions are not interrupted due to wartime. If the rear area is not well prepared, it will greatly affect the morale of the front lines. The convocation of this meeting is for this reason, hoping to achieve good results from today's convocation. The representatives then successively expressed their opinions, and finally resolved: (1) The various organizations will separately request the government to continue production at the factories of major industrial production and urge implementation.

### Anti-Enemy Support Association Announces Measures for Collecting Scrap Copper, Aluminum, and Iron

Resistance Requires Strengthening Military Material Resources, Collection Divided into Citizen and School Groups

The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association yesterday announced measures for collecting scrap copper, aluminum, and iron, hoping that all sectors will donate to strengthen military material resources. The registration of the wartime service corps organized by the association will close on the 10th. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency has recorded the details as follows:

Origin of Collection

Since the Lugouqiao Incident, a full-scale war may break out at any time. The supply of military materials will also increase sharply. However, military materials depend on raw materials. Once the external supply of raw materials is cut off, wouldn't we be helpless? Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said, "We must make a long-term resistance in order to achieve the final victory." However, long-term resistance should have preparations for long-term resistance. Only after strengthening military materials can there be a possibility of long-term resistance. The Association, in view of this, has specially formulated measures to collect scrap copper, aluminum, and iron in order to strengthen military material resources and turn useless things into useful things. Once the war begins, the whole country will be scorched earth. All military materials will either be destroyed or used by the enemy. If they can be quickly transported for military use, it would be a good plan. When the country is about to be destroyed and the home is about to be lost, patriotic compatriots should jointly support it.

Collection Measures

(1) Scrap copper, aluminum, and iron refer to materials that cannot be used and have already been discarded as waste. Copper can be yellow copper, white copper, purple copper, etc., such as broken copper cans, old wax threads, leaky copper, spittoons, etc. Aluminum is commonly known as steel essence. The steel essence pots and steel essence utensils sold on the market are all included. Iron can be pig iron, wrought iron, bar iron, iron blocks, etc., all are collected. However, iron sheets are not accepted. (2) The collection methods are divided into two groups: citizens and schools. (A) For citizens, the following locations are designated as collection points. Citizens can voluntarily submit to the following locations starting from August 7th: (1) Municipal Education Association at No. 200 Daji Road, Nanshi. (2) Inside the Charity Group on Datong Road, Zhabei. (3) Dashanghai Consumer Cooperative on Pobo Road in the French Concession. (4) He'an Primary School and Municipal Peide Primary School on Xinzha Road in the Public Concession and Huasheng Road. (5) Huatong Factory on Dongchang Road, Pudong. (6) Jiangwan Municipal Office. (7) Wusong Chamber of Commerce. (8) Inside the Beixinjing Defense Corps. (B) For schools, each school will be responsible for notifying students to collect from families and relatives and then send them to the original school for temporary storage (copper, aluminum, and iron should be stored separately). After a certain amount has been collected, the school will send it to the above-mentioned collection points in the citizen group for collection. (3) After a certain amount has been collected in each location, the Association will collect it, melt it, and submit it to the government for use.

At 2:30 AM the night before last, Wu was sound asleep with his wife, Chen, 20 years old, also a native of Changshu, when Jin Yongliang, a fellow villager, sneaked into the pavilion room and threatened Chen with a knife to keep her quiet. Chen hurriedly woke her husband, Wu Kunyuan, who jumped up and fought with Jin. Furniture and electrical wires were damaged in the room. In the end, Wu was no match for Jin, and was stabbed in the right eye. Wu stumbled out in pain and collapsed on the stairs, dying shortly after.

Jin Diqing hired lawyer Fan Gang, and Yang Jingxian hired lawyer Xu Wufang, to appear in court for defense. First, the police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated the facts and then claimed that, according to Articles 195 and 196 of the Criminal Law, the crime of manufacturing and using counterfeit currency should be prosecuted to the court. However, Zhou Yang's case was found to be unrelated, so it was requested that she be released from detention. The Japanese and Korean accomplices were also brought to court today. However, only Ishii Nobuyoshi seemed to know more details about the case. He had written a detailed confession for the court to refer to. If there was anything unclear, he could be summoned for questioning, etc. Then, Chinese Detective Zhu Shuling reported the process of arresting the defendants (details omitted as previously reported). Finally, the responsibilities of each defendant were explained in detail.

The 400 counterfeit banknotes were said by Liu Bin to have been given to him by Zhou Yuqing, but Zhou claimed that he obtained them from Yang Jingxian, so Yang was also arrested. As for Zhao Shusheng and Jin Diqing, they were related to the case of jointly organizing the counterfeiting of Guangdong Provincial Bank banknotes with Deng Cigan from Hong Kong and Ishii. Six copper plates of the counterfeit banknotes and spare parts of printing machines were also seized, etc. After the court questioned Ishii, it questioned each of the defendants and then postponed the hearing for further investigation.

Idle Talk

### Some Opinions on Staging "Defend Lugou Bridge"

— Luo Caiqing

"Defend Lugou Bridge" is only able to meet us on stage today, which, as Mr. Li Yi said a few days ago, inevitably gives a sense of being "late," but as the preface to "Defend Lugou Bridge" says, "We use the pen when we have a pen, and the mouth when we have a mouth. When both mouth and pen are insufficient, we will let our soldiers fight the enemy with flesh and blood on the battlefield. We are unwilling to be slaves, and we are willing to guarantee the eternal existence of our nation with blood to the enemy." Although Lugou Bridge has now fallen—and even Beiping has been lost—the nation has an iron-like heart and will fight the enemy with flesh and blood on the battlefield. The roar of "Lugou Bridge can be our grave" will guarantee that we win the final victory.

What I want to say now are a few opinions regarding staging "Defend Lugou Bridge." The announcement from the China Playwrights Association says, "This play relinquishes its performance rights, and all domestic and foreign theater groups are welcome to rehearse and perform it freely." This is worthy of our support. "Fix bayonets, brothers, spread out!" (See the interlude "Fix Bayonets" in the second part of "Defend Lugou Bridge"—dedicated to the soldiers of good China) This is not only the great duty of the soldiers of the Republic of China, but also the unanimous action of the entire nation, because "The Chinese nation is a collective of iron! We cannot lose an inch of land! When soldiers die in battle, the people will replace them! When husbands die in battle, wives will replace them!" (See the theme song of "Defend Lugou Bridge") However, in several larger cities, such as Shanghai and Nanjing, there are many theater groups, but in other remote areas, people don't even know what "spoken drama" is. They are also members of the "collective of iron," but their mouths and pens have no place to be used, and this responsibility should be borne by mobile theater groups. We must use the power of agitation to awaken and connect the people in various places. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is best for several small theater groups to unite, with each group taking charge of a scene, such as Group A being responsible for the first scene, and Group B being responsible for the second scene, etc. After pre-determining the route of departure, they should travel in groups. For example, Group A performs the first scene in a certain place and immediately sets off for the second destination, while Group B fills in and continues to perform the second scene... In this way, the number of people can be reduced, the action will be more convenient, and they can quickly penetrate into the interior. Moreover, they can use the performance style of "Put Down Your Whip," that is, in open spaces, streets, and alleys, setting up a curtain as a house and erecting a bamboo pole as a door, and performing there. We don't need to study acting skills; we only need to express the emotions in the play to stimulate and agitate the audience. It is said that Mr. Tian Han expressed this opinion during the performance of "Lugou Bridge" in Nanjing.

As for local groups that can organize theater groups automatically, that is naturally even better. As mentioned above, the performance aspect can be as simple as possible, preferring to save unnecessary consumption and perform more shows. Moreover, locally organized theater groups may use dialects for performance. The language in our country is not uniform, and performing in the national language can be alienating in many places. Performing in dialects can not only fully express the performers' emotions, but also make the listeners feel particularly close, which is more reliable in terms of effectiveness.

The current public performance of "Defend Lugou Bridge" in Shanghai can only be held at the Penglai Grand Theater in the Nanshi area due to the special circumstances of the concessions, which we find distressing, but we should also take advantage of the strengths of mobile theater groups and set off to Caojiadu, Pudong, and other areas in the simplest form to perform. This is not only a hope for the China Theater Group Liaison Society, but also the responsibility of other small theater groups. As for the duration of this performance, it is said to be only four days, and the highest ticket price is one yuan, which seems too exclusive. The performance period is so short, perhaps due to the workers' time constraints, but we may expand the scope, concentrate all talents, and have whoever is available perform, without limiting it to these few people, so as to extend the performance period. The ticket price is as high as one yuan, which may be due to the high rent of the theater or other excessive expenses, but later we can have a few special performances, lowering the ticket price; it would be best if it could be sold for ten cents or five cents. These are just my personal opinions.

These personal opinions are also what the "preface" hopes for: that this script can be widely performed in the front and rear, and even more hopes that the audience who have seen the play can resonate with us—all the people and officers in the play—and shout:

Defend Lugou Bridge! Defend North China! Defend the Motherland! All those who are unwilling to be slaves, rise up!

### Under the Sunshine

— Zhifu

North China is being ravaged by the devil's hooves. The drums of war have sounded, and finally, the storm has stirred the entire Chinese nation. However, although a part of our South China populace has already awakened, others are still shrouded in the darkness, living the same lives as usual. In this environment, we young people are like volcanoes, ready to erupt from the earth's crust at any moment. We will never forget the great mission we bear!

However, our main task is not to rush to the battlefield with guns, but to make the people aware of who is the culprit and the true murderer in this North China incident. Therefore, this group of young people, singing "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves... braving the enemy's gunfire, advance!" with excitement and enthusiasm, walked into every slum.

The first afternoon of starting the propaganda.——

It was a day with intense sunshine. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, and the wind was still. This slum was like a cast iron pan that had been scorched red, filled with heat waves everywhere. We walked along this winding path, and after half an hour of torture, we finally stopped on an open space where garbage had been piled up into mounds and sewage had flowed into streams.——In front of this open space were about a hundred or so low houses like pigeon cages.

Odor, heat, thirst—at this moment, the trinity intertwined in each of our bodies. But we didn't relax our current position because of this and prepared everything.

At this moment, many people had already surrounded us on both sides: especially a group of children, desperately tugging at shoulders and raising their legs, squeezing rough, dirty faces out of the crowd and shouting in strange voices, as if watching some kind of show:

"The student brothers are here to speak, Mom! Come listen..."

"Come and see!............"

The adults were also as excited as ants finding scattered fish bones, and gradually everyone dropped their work and surrounded the four of us.

The number of people kept increasing, and at first they whispered to each other, starting arguments. Then, they revealed welcoming smiles to us; and there were two or three people who I personally saw vying for a dilapidated bench so that we could sit down in peace.

"Sir, please speak!"

After a noisy and chaotic sound, an unusually serious mood returned in an instant. Then one of our partners began to speak:

"Brothers, uncles! Our Tianjin and Beiping have now been seized by the strongmen, who are killing and setting fires everywhere. Most of the houses over there have been destroyed!... Although the soldiers are risking their lives on the front lines, they are bombing us with planes and cannons. We don't know how many compatriots have been killed or injured at Lugou Bridge and Changxindian.——We are in the rear, and we can't tolerate it anymore. We should prepare and use our fists as weapons to fight..."

"Beat to death the ×× people! We want to fight!——"

Suddenly, his passionate voice was scattered by the voices of the people around him! In the crowd, many eyes were bathed in blood: angrily raising thick arms. Every face was covered in beads of sweat the size of soybeans...

However, in order to prevent the police from giving us the crime of "disturbing public order," we hurriedly stood up and shouted at the top of our voices:

"Don't yell, everyone listen quietly!"

We strained our throats before suppressing their roars. Then our partner continued to say:

"Don't worry! We've already sent troops to the front to fight! ... But when the north is in danger, you in the rear must not listen to the temptations of evil people and become traitors, causing us great damage! ——"

### Defend Lugou Bridge ㊁

— Written by Chen He

In a small teahouse near Lugou Bridge, at this time, there was a one-legged veteran soldier named Liu Debiao singing "Ballads of Lost Territory." The lyrics went:

"One territory after another is lost, Jilin, Zhening, Heilongjiang: After Rehe, it's Hebei and Chahar, aggression is rampant day by day.

Like splitting bamboo without resistance, the enemy is even more ambitious: Since ancient times, water is blocked by earth, and soldiers are blocked by generals, how can we have no response when bandits come to fight?"

Old Liu's ballad won everyone's praise, and some even asked for "another one," but Old Liu said, "I'm just a rough old man, I don't know how to sing any songs. I learned this from the team before."

So he talked about Gubeikou, where their Twenty-ninth Army's Big Sword Brigade left a bit of prestige. Old Liu exchanged one of his legs for one of the Japanese devils' tanks, and dozens of lives...

There was someone named Ding Datou who asked him: "Since the Big Sword Brigade was so impressive, how come they didn't kill all the Japanese devils?"

Old Liu said, "I don't know about that. The superiors told us brothers to retreat."

"Damn it! They're willing to be traitors!"

"Traitors are also our enemies!..."

"That's right!" The four of us couldn't help but give a loud round of applause to those stubborn compatriots. They smiled triumphantly and continued to listen to our advice.——

"...We know that most people become traitors for their own livelihood. They are poor, so they naturally like to do it for a while, but this is a mistake! You must guard against each other. If anyone discovers that someone's behavior is suspicious, report it to the local police station immediately, and that is also a very great merit!..."

"Okay! We will definitely follow this method: However, the ×× people are bullying us too much. We demand that they be driven out of North China... If you see the adults, please convey a message for us little people————"

That tall young man said these big words excitedly, and we were almost moved to tears; we had almost forgotten that we were standing under the intense sunlight, suffering from the heat waves....

After about an hour, in order to instill these ideas into a wider range of citizens, we left this sun-scorched area.

As we left, this crowd of people waved to us and shouted heartily:

"Gentlemen, goodbye!——"

### "How How"

— Changqing

When I was young, I read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." When Zhuge Liang gave instructions to his generals, the author used "thus and thus" and "in this way and in this way" to lightly pass over the military plans without elaborating. This method was not related to "military secrets," but was merely a foreshadowing technique used by the author to create twists and turns in the story. In fact, Zhuge Liang must have explained the plans of deployment to all his generals.

On the fourth of the month, a news item was published in various newspapers under the headline "Government Colleagues' Opinions are Completely Consistent":

"Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch" A report from the Central News Agency: The spokesperson for the Ministry of Military Affairs stated: Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, our government has been prudently responding according to its established policy, and the opinions of the entire country are completely consistent. Government colleagues have no different opinions. The foreign reports claiming that He Yingqin and others advocated "how how" are absolutely inaccurate and are likely based on false rumors.

This is another category of "how" in addition to "thus" and "in this way." And the reason why there is this category of "how" is probably not a conspiracy by traitors, but slander by the enemy. Because since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, the Central Government no longer used foreshadowing techniques in its statements. It has long announced the minimum four-point position and the determination to sacrifice to the end at the final moment. The central government's national policy, "thus and in this way," has long been known to every household and child. If one wants to carve out a path of "how" from "thus and in this way," it is nothing but a conspiracy by traitors and the enemy.

The enemy and traitors want to carve out a path of "how" from our national policy of "thus and in this way." Although there is no certainty, Shigeru Kawagoe, who had been delaying, finally flew from Dalian to Shanghai. The implication is very thought-provoking. He said, "Although his strength is weak, he still hopes to be able to transform Sino-Japanese relations on the last crisis line, and do his best to adjust national relations. However, given the general trend, he fears that he may not be able to. If that is the case, then the aftermath can only be left to the young people." He is using "adjusting national relations" to open up a path of "how," and using "leaving it to the young people" to intimidate our established policy of "in this way." This is truly an excellent diplomatic expression. And the Tokyo Central News Agency's report added the sentence: "Great expectations are placed on Kawagoe's trip here." It seems to convey that the enemy really has no territorial ambitions. It seems that there really is a path of "how" that can be opened up. This truly makes people exclaim, "What to do! What to do!"
