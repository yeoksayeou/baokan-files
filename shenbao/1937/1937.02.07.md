### The Smuggling of Private Loans into North China Becomes Increasingly Serious

European and American Goods Also Enter the Country Through Tax Evasion; British Consul-General in Tianjin Inquires About Smuggling Suppression

Tianjin Correspondence: In the past week, the influx of smuggled goods into Tianjin and Beijing has been extremely turbulent, even more so than during the most rampant period in the early summer of last year. The types of smuggled goods are no longer limited to Japanese goods such as sugar and rayon. Many valuable European and American goods are also smuggled into the country. Dalian Port has always had a free trade zone. All European and American goods shipped by boat to Dalian Port and anchored without unloading for sale enjoy tax-free treatment. Smugglers have taken advantage of this to ship goods from Europe and America, and then transfer them by smugglers' speedboats to Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao and other places in the eastern Hebei region for unloading. They are then protected by armed Japanese ruffians, reloaded onto heavy military vehicles, and transported to Tianjin. In addition to a certain concession, private goods are also stockpiled in many other countries' concessions. A certain European country's concession near a certain country's concession is also tempted by the high profits brought by smugglers, and therefore provides protection. When the customs sometimes discovers and wants to confiscate the goods, they are obstructed. Therefore, the current smuggling situation is widespread and the methods are diverse. As for the private goods transported from eastern Hebei to Tianjin, the use of the Beining Railway has become an extremely clumsy method in the past. Smuggling firms and smuggling companies are all equipped with a large number of heavy-duty vehicles that run exclusively between Beidaihe, Tangshan, and Tianjin. Recently, some Japanese ruffians have planned to monopolize the private transport patent on the Beijing-Tianjin and Tianjin-Tanggu highways, with thirty vehicles running on the two highways. Ten vehicles will travel back and forth seven times a day on the Beijing-Tianjin line, each carrying forty passengers and smuggled goods. The number of trips between Tianjin and Tanggu is not fixed, and will be coordinated with steamships. There will be a total of twenty vehicles, each carrying twenty passengers and smuggled goods. It is said that they will appear in mid-February, at which time the smuggling in the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin will be even more difficult to prevent. Li Xing, the chief inspector of the Road Transport Smuggling Suppression Office, has been active in Tianjin recently, but has made no progress. It was originally hoped that the authorities would provide armed assistance in smuggling suppression, but it is still difficult to realize in the short term. Some time ago, as a temporary remedy, external personnel were sent to track the private goods transported out of Tianjin. When they arrived at the unloading point and the Japanese ruffians left, the local authorities would assist in detaining the goods. This method has been quite effective in areas such as Gaoyang, Xingtai, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang. However, recently, many Japanese ruffians have gone to various detention locations to cause trouble, shouting and making noise, and ganging up to beat people. The local authorities are unable to resist and can only shrink back, rendering this method of the inspection office ineffective. It is reported that Dalian has more than 50 million yuan worth of private goods in stock, which will be transported to Tianjin within two months. If this batch of private goods all enters the country, even if no more is transported in the future, it will be enough to dump for six months, and the North China market will be affected and changed, which is to be expected. Therefore, the customs, the Road Transport Inspection Office, and foreign businesses are all feeling panicked. Among them, British businesses are feeling particularly threatened by the direct infringement and the danger of being deprived of the market. At 3:00 PM on the 28th, British Consul-General in Tianjin, Afflick, visited Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong under the order of his Ambassador to China, Hixon, to inquire. Zhang sent Secretary-General Ma Yanchong to meet him. Consul Afflick expressed the British side's great concern about the current rampant smuggling and armed protection by Japanese ruffians in North China. British businesses are currently greatly affected, and the British side is very willing to hear whether the Tianjin Municipal Government is prepared to suppress smuggling by force. Ma replied that this is a problem for China as a whole and cannot be handled by Tianjin alone. If the government has an order to suppress smuggling by force, it will certainly be obeyed. Consul Afflick said that he would telegraph Ambassador Hixon about this. This is the situation where the rampant smuggling has attracted the attention of Europe and the United States. Also, on the 28th, the Tianjin British Concession authorities assisted Sharpe, the tax commissioner of the customs smuggling suppression department, in sealing up the Desheng Foreign Firm established by a White Russian at No. 39 Hai Avenue in the concession. According to confidential information obtained by the customs, the Desheng Foreign Firm has been selling smuggled piece goods exclusively for half a year, and there is conclusive evidence, so this decisive measure was taken. However, this is enough to prove that the British side hopes that our smuggling suppression will be effective, more so than any other party.

### Anhui Province Vegetable Oil Factory Under Construction

Starting with a Survey of Production Statistics; Seeking to Help with Transportation and Refining

Wuhu Correspondence: The China Vegetable Oil Company established by the Ministry of Industry was formally established one month ago. It has recently obtained shares from five provinces including Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Zhejiang, and is working together to plan large-scale operations. Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei and other provinces mainly produce tung oil and have each set up factories for refining. Now an Anhui Provincial Office has been established in Wuhu, and agricultural expert Cui Langu has been specially hired as the director to plan and implement the project, which has already shown some results. Among the vegetable oils produced in Anhui Province, tung oil is certainly not as good as Sichuan and Hubei, but other items such as rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil are known for their abundance. The amount exported from Wuhu each year is very large. According to Mr. Cui, the management of vegetable oils in Anhui Province is different from other provinces: ❶ There are no statistics on the production of various oils; ❷ The transportation and sales of oils are mostly scattered and not concentrated. Therefore, the current plan is to concentrate the transportation and sales of oils, and to clarify the output of various oils, simplifying the complex before starting operations. Financial support should be given to the existing ten oil workshops, so that they remain one of the centers of rural economic activity. Those who export should be assisted with transportation and sales or transformed into refining operations, so as to achieve practical results under reasonable management. Based on the above principles, the current work is to prioritize surveys. The locations for producing tung oil are: in southern Anhui, a line from Jing County and Ningguo to Qimen; a line from Zhide to Guichi; in central Anhui, a line from Susong and Taihu to Huoshan and Lihuang. Special personnel have been dispatched to investigate each of these locations in order to understand the actual situation. As for the establishment of a vegetable oil factory, it will be decided based on the production and sales situation. If it must be established, Wuhu is the best location, because water and land transportation are convenient, which is very helpful for transportation and sales. As for the Zhengda Oil Factory originally located outside the East Gate of Wuhu, because it has been shut down for many years, the factory buildings and machinery are all decayed and unusable, and cannot be utilized, so it is not planned to be acquired. However, efforts will be made to increase production, such as tung seeds, rapeseed, peanuts, cottonseed, tea seeds, and doujiu seeds, and people will be encouraged to plant them in various ways. The Anhui Provincial Government is also making use of the official wasteland along the Wuhu-Tunxi Road to plant tung trees on a large scale. Mr. Cui also plans to visit the provincial government in the next few days to discuss the direction of progress with Director Liu of the Construction Department, and to negotiate with local banks, because their offices are located throughout the province, and this complete economic mechanism will be used as a foundation for promotion.

### The Significance of the Singapore Naval Exercise

— Hua

On the fourth of this month, the British naval and air forces held a large-scale exercise in Singapore. Singapore is the largest British naval base in the Far East. More than 8,000 naval and air force personnel participated in this exercise. Almost all of the troops originally stationed in Singapore, the air and land forces of the Malay Peninsula, the entire fleet on the China Sea, and even the air force of India and Iraq participated. Such a large-scale exercise is worthy of our deep attention at a time when the diplomatic situation in the Far East is at a turning point.

Looking at the course of this exercise in Singapore, there are two important points. First, the hypothetical enemy in this exercise is "an independent country with a smaller air force, but whose army is strong and modern." We can understand which country this refers to at a glance. This also shows that the British Empire's policy in the Pacific is no longer to put the suppression of colonial independence movements first, but to put resisting the threat of another imperialism first. Second, the result of this exercise proved the failure of the hypothetical enemy's attack. From now on, the British Empire will feel more confident in the struggle in the Pacific. But precisely because it is more confident militarily, we can expect its diplomatic attitude to become stronger.

In terms of broad international relations, this exercise in Singapore is even more important. Frankly speaking, Britain's construction of the Singapore naval base was mainly to deal with Japan. After the end of the last war, the Anglo-Japanese alliance was cancelled. At the request of the various self-governing colonies, the British Imperial government began construction of the Singapore naval base in 1921. This huge construction project was interrupted for some time due to the British government's finances. But after Japan's large-scale invasion of our country in 1931, the Pacific Ocean was turbulent. The British government also resolutely decided on a seven-year naval base construction plan to make Singapore an impregnable fortress. For this reason, Japanese soldiers once called the Singapore naval base "a sharp knife pointed at Japan's chest." On the British side, it was clearly recognized as a barrier to prevent Japan from advancing south.

In recent years, Japan's struggle with Britain in the South Pacific has been very blatant. On the one hand, Japanese goods have invaded Southeast Asia in an overwhelming manner. On the other hand, Japan has also attempted to obtain the right to open the Kra Canal in Siam, thereby undermining the value of the Singapore naval base. When British General Allenby came to inspect in 1934, he had to return in a hurry due to the pursuit of an assassin from "a certain country." In December of the same year, a mysterious espionage case occurred in Singapore. A well-known Japanese resident actually committed suicide by taking poison when he was summoned to the police station for questioning. In the past year, Anglo-Japanese relations seem to have undergone a sudden change. Originally, both the British Conservative Party and the Japanese military had the intention of restoring Anglo-Japanese relations, but after Lees-Ross visited Tokyo and felt deeply disappointed, compromise became an illusion. Various sharp struggles gradually became blatant. The obvious manifestation of this struggle in international diplomacy is that Britain has gradually agreed to our country's united resistance to the enemy. Britain has expressed active support for the United States. Britain has also adopted an attitude of understanding towards its original hypothetical enemy, the Soviet Union, and supports its tough stance in the Far East. The connection between the Pan American Airlines and the British Imperial Airlines in Hong Kong, the visit of the US Far East Fleet to Singapore, and Britain's agreement to the Soviet Union's freedom to build warships in the Far East are factual manifestations that are worth carefully discerning. And now the large-scale exercise in Singapore has told us the two meanings mentioned above. We, who are on the eve of a major change in the international situation, should clearly recognize this important trend.

### Japan's Original Budget Will Be Reduced by 10%

Expenditures for the Army and Navy Are Inevitably Reduced; Tax Increase Plan Will Also Be Abandoned

[Tokyo] The Hayashi Cabinet is taking advantage of the second parliamentary recess to step up efforts to revise the budget and other bills. The most important of these are the revised budget draft and the tax increase plan, which have attracted much attention. It is reported that the newly appointed Minister of Finance, Yūki Toyotaro, is currently planning to reduce the original budget of 3.04 billion yuan by 10%, i.e., the expenditure for the Army and Navy will each be reduced by 50 million yen, and other items will also be reduced by 20,000 yuan. This is quite shocking.

Regarding the revision of the tax increase plan, it is generally believed that the following new taxes, such as personal property tax, securities transaction tax, and collateral tax, must be cancelled, because such expenses cannot be borne by consumers. In addition, there are plans to increase income tax and consumption tax, which are the direct causes of soaring prices and labor unrest, and can also be largely abolished. However, it is highly doubtful whether this budget reduction plan can be approved by the Army and Navy, because the Army and Navy have repeatedly insisted on passing the original budget. On the other hand, if this plan cannot be completed within the next five or six days, the parliament will inevitably recess for the third time. This may not only increase the political parties' aversion to the government, but also make it impossible for the parliament to re-examine the budget within the prescribed time limit.

In addition, the nationalization of electricity and the extension of compulsory education from six to eight years may also be abolished. However, regarding the political reform of central and local administrative organs, because the Army insists on this proposal, the Cabinet Council decided in principle on the 5th to establish a General Affairs Agency. Vice-Minister of the Army, Umezu Yoshijiro, visited Chief Cabinet Secretary Ohashi Hachiro on the 5th, and firmly stated that there was a real need to strengthen the General Affairs Agency. Minister of the Army, Nakamura Kotaro, also told reporters after the Cabinet Council meeting on the 5th that the resolution on reforming the administration that the Army submitted to the previous cabinet in November last year should be quickly and fully implemented.

The four positions of Colonial Minister, Commerce Minister, Communications Minister, and Education Minister are all held by other provincial ministers due to lack of sufficient time. It is generally believed that this is a reservation for realizing the Army's request to merge provincial positions. Prime Minister Hayashi will not make a report on foreign policy in his capacity as concurrently Foreign Minister, but will solemnly explain in his prime ministerial speech that Japan will strive to establish friendly relations with all countries in the future, starting with China and the Soviet Union. He will also announce that he will abandon unnecessary secret diplomacy policies in view of the public's strong criticism of Hirota and Arita's secret diplomacy. (Central News Agency telegram, 6th)

### Prime Minister Hayashi Will Visit the Presidents of the Two Parties

Please Pass All Pending Cases; Minister of the Army Supports the Cabinet

[Tokyo] Since the parliament after the recess will reconvene in a few days, the government is focusing on parliamentary countermeasures, especially opening up relations with political parties. Prime Minister Hayashi, Interior Minister Kawarada, and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Yamazaki, etc., believe that in order to smoothly operate parliamentary politics, the government and political parties should respect themselves at the same time and smoothly conclude this session of parliament. Therefore, they believe that they must devote all their efforts to the work of political parties. In particular, those around the Prime Minister advocate that since the parliament has requested a recess according to the wishes of the Ministry of Finance, in order to prepare for the shortness of the deliberation period and to smoothly pass the budget and other important bills, Prime Minister Hayashi may visit the presidents of the two major parties, the Seiyukai and Minseito, at this time and ask them to stand on the perspective of the overall situation and give the parliament their approval. This view has been gaining ground recently. Even the political parties that ostensibly maintain a non-committal attitude internally expect the Prime Minister to earnestly plead with them in order to avoid conflicts with the government and the military. Therefore, this trend is worthy of attention. (Domei News Agency telegram, 6th)

Odawara: Prime Minister Hayashi took a train from Tokyo Station at 10:30 PM on the 6th to visit the Ise Grand Shrine. According to his remarks in the train, our country is a country where ritual and politics are one, because the great meaning of respecting the gods and honoring the king is the true essence of our national polity and the foundation of national morality. I was unexpectedly ordered to take on the heavy responsibility, so I came to visit the Grand Shrine, kowtow before the gods, report my inauguration, and pledge to do my best to overcome the difficulties of the times. I have convened Cabinet meetings every day since I formed the Cabinet and am discussing the outline of what should be explored in the future. Although many Cabinet members hold multiple positions and the number of people is small, it is easier for opinions to converge, which is more convenient in terms of achieving harmony. As for the political program, a statement will be issued in the near future. The new Cabinet must seek reforms in light of the domestic and international situation, but it will never make drastic changes, nor will it merely compromise or苟合, but will make maintaining the status quo its ability, and will implement clear politics to carry out reforms suitable for the times. The parliament is adjourned until the 10th of this month, and the budget and all bills are temporarily withdrawn for reconsideration. It is not yet known whether a request will be made to reconvene the parliament. The new Cabinet has no so-called party members and few members with seats in parliament. Some say that this is very inappropriate to face the parliament, but I believe that the parliament can truly review the government's proposals from the perspective of the country, and the Cabinet members can also recognize the importance of the situation and have sufficient sincerity to work with the people of the whole country to overcome the difficulties of the times. Since I have obtained the support of the people of the whole country, I will always move forward towards a just and bright constitutional government. (Domei News Agency telegram, 6th)

[Tokyo] What are the Hayashi Cabinet's parliamentary strategies and other policies? When they were decided, they were largely dominated by the so-called promoting force, i.e., the Army's movements. Minister of the Army Nakamura's attitude is attracting much attention. However, after the Cabinet Council meeting on the 5th, Minister of the Army Nakamura stated that his attitude was exactly the same as that of former Minister of the Army Terauchi, and that he would always move forward with what he believed in. He also denied the theory that the Army's leadership was passive, and stated that the Army was still moving forward with a resolute attitude. The Army authorities are now reviewing various important issues with a cautious attitude. (Domei News Agency telegram, 6th)

### Japanese Economic League Decides to Send Envoys

Visit Britain, the United States, and Germany

[Tokyo] The Japan Economic League held a standing committee meeting on the 5th to discuss the issue of sending economic envoys to Britain and the United States, which had been a long-standing proposal. As a result, it was officially decided to send envoys, and Chairman Gōshi Kōnosuke was appointed to select the candidates. The delegation will be composed of five influential figures from the financial world (three from Tokyo and two from Osaka). The theory that Kagami Kenkichi, Kadono Jūkuro, and Kushida Manzō will be the leaders of the delegation is quite powerful, but Kagami's voice is the highest. According to the agreement, they will depart from Japan in mid-April to the United States to exchange views on Japanese-US trade issues, and then go to Berlin to attend the Ninth International Chamber of Commerce Conference as representatives of Japan, and vigorously invite the Tenth Congress to be held in Tokyo, and then cross to the UK in mid-July to exchange views on the basic issues of Anglo-Japanese economic relations, and then return home in late August. (Domei News Agency telegram, 6th)

[Tokyo] Although the Japanese business community certainly has this intention, there is no concrete decision yet. In particular, regarding the dispatch of economic envoys to China, they must wait for the closing of the Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Kuomintang and have a clear confirmation of their future attitude towards Japan before they can take definite steps. They are taking a wait-and-see attitude before fully understanding the wishes of the Chinese people. (Central News Agency telegram, 6th)

### Shipbuilding Plan of Nippon Yusen Kaisha

[Tokyo] Nippon Yusen Kaisha, originally the largest shipping company in Japan, has decided to implement a large-scale shipbuilding plan in order to compete with Osaka Shosen Kaisha to strengthen various routes. Nippon Yusen Kaisha currently has 85 merchant ships with a total tonnage of 630,000. Osaka Shosen has 115 merchant ships with a total tonnage of 500,000. However, Osaka has recently acquired the management rights of 32 merchant ships from the International Transportation Co., Ltd. International is a giant among Japanese freight companies, with a total tonnage of 300,000. Since Osaka and International have a tendency to merge, Nippon Yusen is feeling pressured and has no choice but to catch up quickly. Nippon Yusen plans to improve its government-subsidized scheduled routes and then strengthen its non-subsidized routes. It has decided to build several larger and more perfect merchant ships to cope with the situation. The Ministry of Communications has approved Nippon Yusen Kaisha's shipbuilding plan, and construction can begin this year. New ships will be added to other routes such as Liverpool, Australia, and Mumbai. The company has now raised 30 million yen for shipbuilding, and can draw on a portion of undistributed profits if necessary. However, what the Japanese Ministry of Communications and major shipping companies are worried about is that there is a rumor that Britain will prohibit Japanese merchant ships from carrying passengers and cargo between major British ports, because Japan does not allow foreign ships to sail in Japanese coastal waters, and Japanese freight is active overseas, such as the routes between Japan and India, Japan and Persia, Japan and Australia, New Zealand, and Japan and New York. Japanese ships pose an unparalleled threat to British ships, forcing British merchants to prepare for competition. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)

### Turkey, Nation, and Party are One

Party Constitution is Included in the Constitution

Turkey, Capital: The People's Party, led by President Kemal, originally advocated six principles, namely republicanism, nationalism, democracy, state interventionism, ultra-religious movement, and revolution. It has been in place for many years. Prime Minister İsmet recently submitted a bill to the National Assembly requesting that these principles be included in the Constitution. The National Assembly has recently voted to pass it, and the People's Party and the Turkish nation have merged into one. (Havas telegram, 6th)

### First Sea Lord Hall Discusses British Defense

Singapore is the Hub

[London] First Sea Lord Sir Hall gave a speech on British national defense and economic development at the Brentwood Chamber of Commerce banquet tonight. He said that although the national defense responsibilities of the British Empire are very difficult, it would be a big mistake to impose a harsh plan on other parts of the Empire. We may as well tell the truth. When the Imperial Conference is convened after March, we will have this opportunity to see how the various territories will cooperate with us and what their strength is. At that time, the sister states of the Empire will be able to understand the huge cost and minimal effectiveness of self-defense alone. He also said that the key to the Empire's national defense lies in large-scale mobilization, because the air forces of various countries are developing extremely rapidly, and defending one place alone is a waste of effort. As for maritime power, if its mobility is reduced, it is useless. Therefore, the Singapore naval base is the hub of the safety of the British sister states. Although it is not hostile to any country, it must be made the most modern naval base in the world. Now the Empire should concentrate its efforts on national defense and economic development. Each unit of the Empire should be able to bear a part of the responsibility, especially the heavy responsibility of national defense. He also said that the completion of the Empire's national defense requires unwavering perseverance and a spirit of sacrifice, but the British government should have broad understanding for the various states of the Empire that have not yet been fully developed, for the hundreds of millions of Indian people who are now beginning constitutional experiments, and even for countries outside the Empire, so as not to allow them to fall into the abyss of despair.

### The British Emperor Does Not Intend to Go to India This Year

Queen Mother Visits the Duke of Windsor

[London] Today's Times editorial said that some people think that the British Emperor may go to India this year to hold a coronation ceremony. Now it is known that this hope is not to be relied upon. The Emperor had to be crowned five months after his accession to the throne, so he recently summoned his ministers to attend meetings to discuss political affairs. He was extremely tired. Since the Emperor returned to Beijing from Sandringham, he has been working day and night without rest. For a while, he may not be able to take a break, and the Emperor's departure from the country must be carefully considered. Since the coronation ceremony has been held this year, it seems that it is not possible to ask him to go to India to hold the Indian coronation ceremony again. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)

### Roosevelt Addresses Congress on Judicial Reform

Courts Should Adapt to the Times; Remedies Needed for Aging Judges

[Washington] President Roosevelt submitted a special message to Congress today, advocating a thorough reform of the federal judicial system. The most important aspect is requesting authorization for the president to appoint six new judges to the Supreme Court when current justices over the age of seventy are unwilling to retire. This shows that the current government has begun a movement to amend the Constitution. The president's message stated that the necessity of reorganizing the government's administrative structure has been mentioned before. Now, the same suggestion of reorganizing the judicial branch is presented to Congress, conveying that the judicial system can also adapt to modern needs. Congress now needs to pass new laws, but the personnel of the federal judicial branch are truly insufficient to support them. The people have long complained about the complexity, delays, and high costs of legal procedures. Delays in court proceedings will inevitably lead to injustice and make lawsuits a luxury, ultimately only accessible to the few who can afford them and whose interests at stake are worth the cost. If lower courts can expedite the handling of backlogged cases, the Supreme Court will be able to handle its workload more easily. Although the Supreme Court's current workload is extremely heavy, it cannot be considered fair if it rejects 87 percent of private cases without reason. However, the selection of competent judges to handle cases should consider the judges' abilities, which inevitably involves the issue of judges' age and infirmity. Although this issue is very complex, it should be openly discussed. Judges are like ordinary people. In special circumstances, they can still maintain their intelligence and physical strength even when they are old. However, there are many who cannot recognize their own decline. Modern judges need sufficient ability to handle cases effectively, and the complexity of modern problems requires the infusion of new blood into the courts. The president's message suggests the following:

㊀ If a federal judge reaches the age of seventy and does not retire, the president has the authority to appoint a new judge, but the number of Supreme Court justices must not exceed fifteen, or in the case of all judges, the number of appointees must not exceed fifty.

㊁ Federal courts must not issue rulings on cases involving constitutional issues without first notifying the government. Cases concerning these issues may be directly appealed to the Supreme Court and should be expedited.

㊂ District courts may transfer judges to each other to improve court efficiency.

㊃ The Supreme Court should establish a position of agent to oversee the handling of lawsuits in all federal courts to expedite the process. The president declared that if this plan achieves its goals, it will eliminate the need to consider changing the powers of the courts or the Constitution. The president also directly criticized the current judicial system. Before this message was submitted to Congress, government leaders held a meeting at the White House this morning to study it. Congress has now sent the message to the Judiciary Committees of both houses for prompt review. It is noted that there are nine Supreme Court justices, six of whom are over the age of seventy. If this bill passes, the president will have the power to appoint six new judges if the current justices are unwilling to retire. Its real purpose is to correct the court's actions in vetoing New Deal legislation such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act. (National Telegram, 5th)

### Hoover Calls It Affecting the American Political System

Vote Must Wait Two Months to Determine Public Opinion

[New York] Former President Hoover issued a statement today, stating that President Roosevelt's judicial reform plan implies that the court will be subject to the personal power of the chief executive. The proposed plan goes deep into the roots of the American political system, beyond the scope of partisan politics. Its purpose is to avoid amending the Constitution while achieving the effect of subjugating the court, since amending the Constitution requires a public referendum. This case should not be put to a vote until two months later, so as to thoroughly understand the attitude of the people of the whole country. (National Telegram, 5th)

[Washington] Those implementing the New Deal generally warmly welcome the president's move, viewing it as the herald of a new movement. Many believe that the president's long period of hesitation has now passed. Congress can now implement the president's plan to achieve the goals of the New Deal, or amend the Constitution to achieve this goal. People here are generally surprised by the president's resolute proposal of this plan. Roosevelt has only been re-elected for three months, and this sudden and shocking action is enough to demonstrate his ability to adapt to circumstances. The Supreme Court is now about to issue a ruling on the Wagner Labor Act. Those implementing the New Deal generally believe that the court may not reject this legislation. Furthermore, the labor unrest is currently surging, and several labor leaders have expressed concerns to President Roosevelt, fearing that he is increasingly moving towards conservatism and can no longer be relied upon to work hard for labor. Now that President Roosevelt has issued a shocking statement, these concerns have been completely dispelled. The actual effect of this declaration will be to enable President Roosevelt to immediately appoint five Supreme Court justices, so as to ensure the passage of carefully drafted New Deal bills. Although this plan delights those who are implementing the New Deal, conservatives throughout the United States will launch a major attack, because in their eyes, infringing upon the power of the courts is tantamount to treason. Even liberals believe this move is very serious. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)

### British Minister Returns to London

Says Trip to America Was Worthwhile

[London] Secretary of Commerce Runciman, who recently visited President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull in the United States for discussions, has returned from New York by ship and landed at Southampton today. He declined to give a detailed account of the nature of his talks with Roosevelt, only stating that they discussed various global issues, such as the European situation and trade issues. The true significance of his talks with Roosevelt and Hull is often exaggerated by outside speculation, but on the whole, the trip can be said to have been worthwhile. Furthermore, political figures believe that Runciman's trip shows that the two major Anglo-Saxon nations are eager to cooperate on a broad scale, so that the good will for peace of the two countries can be united. This desire is growing day by day. Currently, commercial exchange between the United Kingdom and the United States has established this relatively free basis. If the two countries can conclude a new commercial agreement in the future, it will not only demonstrate the existing good relations between the two countries, but also indicate a common political tendency between the two countries, which is of great significance.

### US Auto Strike Negotiations Near Agreement

But New Disputes Arise

Detroit: The Governor of Michigan stated after meeting with representatives from General Motors and the striking committee, that the opinions of labor and management are closer than before. (National Telegram, 5th)

Detroit: According to reliable sources, negotiations of the auto strike, brokered by President Roosevelt and Governor Murphy, became tense today. The Flint District Court today ordered the eviction and arrest of workers occupying the factory, as well as the arrest of Martin, the leader of the United Auto Workers union, and fourteen other union leaders. Union leaders demanded that company representatives explain this action and criticized the company for lacking sincerity. General Motors Vice President Knudsen replied that we have no right to manipulate the court. Company and union representatives then engaged in a heated debate for three hours at the meeting. (National Telegram, 5th)

Flint: After the striking workers of General Motors occupied the factory, they did not comply with the court's order to withdraw. Judge Gadola has now approved the request of the company's legal representatives and issued arrest warrants for the striking workers, ordering the bailiffs to arrest them. Out of caution, the bailiffs have requested assistance from the local army. At the same time, representatives from labor and management are conducting negotiations in Detroit, Michigan. Although the representatives are unwilling to reveal the progress of the negotiations, responsible parties have stated that the purpose of the negotiations is to establish a temporary compromise, so as to take advantage of this opportunity to continue efforts to completely resolve the strike.

### Spanish Coast Surveillance Issue

Britain, France, Russia Offer to Re-Establish Relations

[London] The Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War submitted a plan to relevant countries to organize an international fleet to patrol the Spanish coast, prevent foreign countries from transporting military equipment into Spain, and assist both sides of the conflict. Soviet Russia has indicated its willingness to participate in this maritime patrol, but advocates for the formulation of a cooperation plan to replace the method of dividing areas and assigning patrols to various countries. Britain, Austria, Turkey, and the Irish Free State have all expressed their willingness to participate in this plan. The committee now expects to receive replies from twenty-four countries. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)

[London] Regarding the Spanish coast surveillance issue, Lord Plymouth, the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee, submitted a proposal to the governments of relevant countries on the 28th of last month, requesting that they submit replies by the 4th of this month. As of today, replies from Britain, France, and Russia have been successively received. The main points are summarized as follows: ㊀ The Soviet reply briefly stated that the government is very willing to participate in the Spanish coast surveillance plan, but cannot accept the division of areas for separate surveillance. (The original proposal advocated dividing the Spanish waters into several areas and assigning them to the navies of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Portugal for separate surveillance, excluding the Soviet navy.) On the contrary, warships from all countries participating in the surveillance work should have the right to conduct surveillance anywhere on the Spanish coast. ㊁ The French government's reply indicated acceptance of the surveillance plan and advocated that warships from all countries undertaking surveillance work should be allowed to inspect all merchant ships, regardless of nationality, once they enter the surveillance area, and should be allowed to monitor unloading. Surveillance personnel dispatched by various countries should also be stationed on warships. ㊂ The British government's reply indicated approval of the surveillance plan, but proposed several revisions to the implementation details. (Havas, 6th)

[London] The replies from Italy, Germany, and Portugal have not yet been received in London. Therefore, although the committee is scheduled to convene a plenary meeting at 11:00 am next Tuesday, it is feared that it may not be able to discuss the replies from relevant countries. (Havas, 6th)

### Colonial Issues Confusing and Unpredictable

British Ambassador to Germany Replaced

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden, accompanied by his wife, went to the French Riviera in southern France this morning for a few days of rest. (Havas, 6th)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to go to the French Riviera in southern France for a few days of rest tomorrow. During his vacation, Lord Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal, will temporarily serve as acting Foreign Secretary. Before Eden's departure, he did not meet with German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop to discuss the issues raised by German Chancellor Hitler in his speech to the House of Commons on January 30. According to responsible parties, Eden's leave of absence is not related to the current state of relations between the United Kingdom and Germany. News reports in the newspapers this morning stated that Halifax is more sympathetic to Germany than Eden, so Ribbentrop would prefer to start negotiations with Halifax rather than with Eden. This statement is completely unfounded. However, Germans here expect that when Ribbentrop and Halifax meet, Ribbentrop will raise the principle of the colonial issue, with the intention of making Britain recognize Germany's right to claim colonies in principle. Semi-official sources have consistently believed that the colonial issue must be resolved within the scope of a comprehensive solution to various difficult issues in Europe. As for making territorial concessions to Germany in Africa or elsewhere, it is still firmly opposed by the Conservative Party. Therefore, it is generally believed that after Ribbentrop and Halifax meet, they may not be able to conduct any important negotiations. (Havas, 5th)

[Manila] Bishop Fourquet of Guangzhou, China, delivered a speech at the International Eucharistic Congress yesterday, touching on the Far East situation and culture. He said, "Looking around the world, the place where competition between countries is most intense is none other than the Far East. God, the angel of peace, must have a way to stabilize it. This is why this Eucharistic Congress is being held here. As for the mission of missionaries in the Far East, its nature is very special. The culture of the Far East has a history of thousands of years and is based on ethics. These ethics are not much different from natural laws. We can easily integrate all the truths of Christianity into it. In addition, the countries of the Far East have deep attainments in art and literature and are highly cultivated. Missionaries who have received good education in Europe and America will easily gain sympathy and achieve much in promoting education." (Havas, 6th)

### British Government Releases Plan to Improve the Physical Condition of the National People

[London] Today's White Paper releases the government's plan to improve the physical condition of the national people, which contains national voluntary physical exercise methods, and regulations to improve the physical condition of school children, which are now being implemented. The government is eager to develop them to the perfect degree, and explains that if they are not supplemented by regulations for those who have exceeded school age, this kind of convenience is ineffective. One of the main purposes of the government's recommendations is to give young people and adults who spend their lives in offices and factories the opportunity to exercise properly. Although local authorities and certain voluntary groups supply this need, there is no proper cooperation, and this matter is often hindered due to lack of funding, especially in poor areas. The government will now appoint two advisory offices, one to handle the affairs of England and Wales, and one to handle the affairs of Scotland, and will appoint two committees for allocating funds. Local affairs will be promoted by the local committees. The government will also set up a national school specializing in training physical education teachers. This plan aims to provide fitness centers, sports fields, swimming pools, and camping sites. This plan needs to be formalized to make it fully effective. It is estimated that in addition to the annual need of 150,000 pounds, another 2 million pounds must be raised and paid in three years. (Special telegram from Zi Lin Bao, 4th)

### Breakdown of Negotiations for Merger of Two Proletarian Political Parties in Japan (Part 2)

— Nan'un

4.  The Japanese Masses in Struggle

The unprecedented large budget (3.04 billion yen) has already been passed by the cabinet. Increased taxes for the masses and rising prices have become current realities. Two or three months ago, a bowl of noodles cost eight sen, now it has risen to ten sen. Stores whose price lists are in units of ten thousand are reducing the quantity of goods. However, wages have not increased.

Using the Japanese cost of living index for July 1913 as "100", it had risen to "168" in December 1932, "169" in December 1933, "179" in December 1934, "182" in December 1935, and "184.9" in April 1936 (according to a survey by the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun). As of January 1937, although no statistics have been published, judging from the articles published in various newspapers and magazines, the soaring cost of living is no longer in question.

Looking at the actual wages of Japanese workers (using the wage index of 1925 as "100"), it was "90.7" in 1931, "88.1" in 1932, "89.2" in 1933, "91.2" in 1934, and "91.1" in 1935 (according to labor statistics from the Bank of Japan). Although there were occasional increases and decreases, it was substantially less than the actual wages of workers in 1925. From 1936 to the present, due to the rising cost of living and currency inflation, the lives of workers have become increasingly difficult, which is not in question.

Let's look at the opinions expressed by bourgeois political parties and industrialists—on the first page of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on January 14, there was a statement by the president of the Seiyukai party discussing how "soaring prices threaten the lives of the people." On the same day, the vice president of Nippon Kokan also published the following remarks in the Tokyo Yomiuri: "If malignant currency inflation continues to advance, wage problems will inevitably arise, and labor-management disputes will frequently occur."

Even Aso Hisashi, the secretary-general of the Shakai Ta衆党, is well aware of this situation. He once said: "Due to rising prices and tax burdens, the hardworking masses will inevitably suffer from a suffocatingly difficult life. In particular, the working class, on the one hand, will have the capitalists' increased tax burden shifted to them through capitalists' methods of strengthening labor and reducing wages; on the other hand, capitalists, in order to accept excessively large orders, feel a lack of productivity and will inevitably extend working hours and intensify labor, leading to insufficient sleep and food for workers..." (Published in this year's New Economic New Year's issue)

"Soaring prices," "intensified labor," "reduced wages"—workers' lives are getting worse, and labor disputes will inevitably occur frequently. However, because control is also more strengthened and oppression is even heavier, labor disputes sometimes appear to decrease on the surface! Let's look at labor disputes in Japan since the "September 18th" incident: in 1931, there were "154,528" workers participating in the struggle, "123,313" in 1932, "116,733" in 1933, "120,307" in 1934, and "103,962" in 1935 (according to the Japanese Labor Yearbook).

Looking at the number of people participating in labor struggles in these five years, except for a slight increase in 1934, it has generally been decreasing. This is of course because the colonies have suddenly expanded, and the burden on some workers has been temporarily shifted to the masses in the colonies. However, at the same time, production has expanded, fixed capital has increased, and capital has become more concentrated and monopolized, which not only cannot solve the contradictions within Japan, but makes the contradictions even more profound. The lives of ordinary middle and small urban residents are closer to the impoverished working class. Looking at the second half of 1935, the number of people participating in labor struggles in July was "5,261", "6,409" in August, "9,005" in September, "6,378" in October, "5,648" in November, and "16,238" in December (according to the Labor Yearbook). In these statistics, it continued to increase from July to September, slightly decreased from October to November, and increased sharply in December, tripling from July. It can also be seen that in the four months from August to December, although the number of people in November was the smallest, it was still more than the number of people in July by more than four hundred. Like the major strikes by dockworkers in the United States, the major strikes by metalworkers in France, and the major strikes by cotton mills in Shanghai, Japan has not experienced such strikes in recent years, but since the economic and political crisis is deepening, who can guarantee that there will be no larger struggles in the future?

Speaking of the lives of Japanese farmers, they are even more impoverished. The number of struggles between tenant farmers and landlords has been increasing sharply since 1929. Using 1929 as "100" (index), it increased to "102" in 1930, "140" in 1931, remained at "140" in 1932, increased to "164" in 1933, "239" in 1934, and "226" (March) in 1935 (the above survey is based on the Labor Yearbook published in December 1936). The struggle index in 1934 was more than double that in 1930. The reasons for the struggles mostly arise from land rent issues and cultivation rights issues.

There is a reason why capitalists allow rural areas to wither: first, it is to maintain a sufficient reserve army of labor, so that cheap labor can be used for a long time; second, in the fierce movement to seize colonies, it is always necessary to enlist the impoverished sons and daughters of farmers into the army. With these two reasons, although the slogan of "reviving the countryside" has been labeled as an "important national policy", it is difficult to hope for it to be fulfilled.

Japanese left-wing fascists also shouted the slogan of "overthrowing the zaibatsu" (the "February 26th" incident was a major failure of this faction). This, to some extent, is a reflection of farmer consciousness.

In the recently announced "Anarchist Conspiracy to Stage a National Riot Case" (Tokyo Yomiuri - January 11 Extra), the main body was the "Rural Youth Society". Although it failed, it cannot be said that this is not a kind of resistance from impoverished farmers.

This is the life of Japanese workers and peasants, but the Japanese proletarian political parties are splitting up—the leaders are splitting up. The stubbornness of sectarianism cannot last long in the development stage of the masses. But at present, this divisive sectarianism has become a major obstacle to the united front movement.

(5) The Future of Japanese Proletarian Political Parties

If the slogans shouted by a political party cannot become the slogans of the masses, then this kind of political party will never be able to lead the masses. Even if a certain slogan shouted by a political party is also a slogan that the masses want to shout, but if the political party has no appropriate tactics and no resolute actions, it will inevitably not be supported by the masses—even if it is supported for a while, it will gradually break away from the masses.

The "anti-fascist" slogan put forward by the Japanese Shakai Ta衆党 has undoubtedly gained the support of many groups. However, in "anti-fascist" actions, it is still not resolute, and in tactics, there is a tendency to despise the strength of allies. How can this "self-righteous Shakai Ta衆党" accomplish the mission of "anti-fascism"? The background of fascism must have the power of financial capitalists, and the fascist movement has also penetrated into a part of the Japanese worker-peasant class. When the fascist party becomes strong and gains dictatorship, if the Shakai Ta衆党 does not abandon its "anti-fascist" position, if it does not become fascist, the existence of the Shakai Ta衆党 will be impossible. The failure of the German Social Democratic Party is a good example. On the one hand, it opposes fascism to a small extent, on the other hand, it approaches fascism to a small extent, and on the other hand, it rejects the union of other proletarian factions. In a positive sense, this approach can at most only strive for the implementation of one or two social reform policies. However, in this kind of reform struggle, objectively, the Shakai Ta衆党 only fulfills the task of serving as a buffer zone between labor and capital. Since it can only fulfill this task, then, when will the "socialism" touted by the Shakai Ta衆党 be realized?

Under the condition of refusing to participate in the People's Front, the Shakai Ta衆党 does not even have the future of the French Blum cabinet. It has a future similar to that of the German Social Democratic Party. However, when a real mass front unfolds, the Shakai Ta衆党 still has a future of internal division.

If the Rōkyō insists on the slogan of the People's Front movement, it will undoubtedly be attacked and even destroyed. However, the problem cannot be viewed solely from the perspective of Japan. The drastic changes in the international situation are of course closely related to the proletarian mass movement in Japan.

According to Japanese newspaper reports: Japan's illegal proletarian political parties have been "swept away", and the unification movement of legal proletarian political parties is so bleak. — However, the Japanese hardworking masses who are struggling with "difficult lives" will never sit idly by and watch this bleakness continue.

### Inside Story of the Crackdown on a Communist Organization in Tianjin

Another plot by a certain country to use Chinese traitors, creating terror as a pretext for coercion. Three criminals arrested confessed the inside story.

On the night of February 2nd, the Tianjin Yongxin and the No. 3 Detective Team of the Tianjin Police Bureau cracked down on a secret communist organization in Daliujia Alley, Fushu Street, inside the city. They seized various printed communist propaganda materials and several oil printing machines. Three criminals, including Guo Xiushan, Yang Yuan, and Deng Wo Xian, were arrested on the spot. It is said that there are many accomplices hiding in the Jinwei Bridge area in Hedong and the Dawangzhuang area in Special District Three. The detective team went to search for them on the 3rd and 4th, but they had all fled upon hearing the news. At the beginning of the crackdown, the authorities only recognized it as an organ of left-leaning elements related to the Third International. Unexpectedly, during the interrogation, the three criminals confessed truthfully without being questioned, saying that they were not genuine communists, but were being used by people from a certain country to set up a fake communist organization, intending to create an atmosphere of communist terror, providing a pretext for a certain party to oppress the Hebei-Chahar region. The so-called expansion of anti-communism by a certain country to make China a special zone, especially since the Xi'an Incident, the realization of this has become more urgent. In addition to supporting the expansion of the fake Jidong organization to expand its fake power into the Hebei-Chahar region, on the one hand, in order to have a direct excuse for participation, they instigated disgruntled warlords and politicians residing in a certain concession in Tianjin to carry out various fake organizations, so as to have a response in case of trouble. The former Zhili-Lu army veterans Cheng Guorui and Wang Huchen refused to take on the job, which was to destroy the Pinghan and Jinpu railway lines. Each railway line was arranged with more than ten teams of fake plainclothes police, each team with thirty people. When the time was right, at a signal, they would start demolishing the rails and blowing up the water towers. For each act of destruction, they would be paid 3,000 yuan. After the work was successfully completed, so-called communist action traces would be left at the scene of the incident, as evidence for a certain party to request assistance in preventing communism. In addition, the former Zhili-Lu army commander Fang Yongchang, the former Zhili-Lu army brigade commander Qiu Wenkai, and the former Tianjin Gendarmerie Commander of the Zhili-Lu army Li Yingjie, etc., were responsible for the so-called North China Anti-Communist Joint Propaganda Association, and recruiting Chinese traitors to secretly go to various counties to promote anti-communism as a slogan, and persuade the people to form fake anti-communist organizations, and echo the expansion of anti-communism autonomy of the Jidong puppet organization. When the Jidong puppet government launched, the puppet anti-communist organizations in various counties would rise up in response. Those belonging to the latter type of activity, in addition to taking Xingtai and Daming counties in southern Hebei as the central area, also had this secret work in Tianjin. According to the confessions of the arrested Guo Xiushan and others, they were actually subordinates of Fang Yongchang, responsible for fabricating evidence of Beidang's (Northern Faction) chaos in Tianjin, so as to provide a certain country with diplomatic work with Hebei and Chahar as the target. As for controlling the aforementioned work in Tianjin, in addition to Fang Yongchang, there is also a certain person from a certain country named Dagongyuan (false name) living on a certain street in a certain concession. This person takes orders from a certain military organization outside the customs. Other circumstances were not detailed in the confessions of the Guo criminals. After the municipal authorities learned the content of this matter, the defense during the Spring Festival has been decided to be strengthened, and a part of the garrison troops in the suburbs of the city has been transferred to the city to assist in the defense, in order to prevent disasters before they happen, and notified the Hebei Provincial Government to pay attention. Feng Zhi'an, the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, inspected the security teams and garrison troops in various counties in southern Hebei on the first day of this month, and gave instructions to prevent Chinese traitors from succeeding. According to a certain important agency, the military departments of a certain country inside and outside the customs, and the two organizations of the puppet Manchukuo and puppet Jidong, will convene a secret meeting in Tianjin during the Spring Festival when our various agencies are on vacation, taking advantage of our inattention, to study the special status of North China, support the expansion of the Jidong puppet organization, and cooperate with various groups of Chinese traitors to expand the puppet power into the Hebei-Chahar region. Although the meeting period is not yet determined, it is around February 12th to 15th, so the situation in North China is full of hidden worries and it is difficult to be optimistic at present. Song Zheyuan will make a final effort in Tianjin for the issue of diplomacy and the abolition of the Hebei-Chahar organization. He has invited Tadashi and Hashimoto from the Japanese side to meet at the Jinde Society at No. 89, 19th Road, British Concession at 2 pm on February 5 to continue negotiations, hoping to bring all pending cases to an end before leaving Tianjin during the Spring Festival.

### Treacherous Actions of Bandits and Puppets in Northern Chahar

Claiming to advance westward, but most are retreating eastward; Shangdu Airport demolished, aircraft parked in Duolun

Zhangbei Communication: Recently, the bandits and puppet troops in northern Chahar once claimed to advance westward, attacking eastern Suiyuan, but the current reality is that most of the bandits and puppets are retreating eastward. At 9:00 am on the 3rd of this month, Li Shouxin suddenly arrived in Zhangbei from Shangdu, and there was news that he would be stationed in Zhangbei for a long time and would not leave recently. On the same day, all of Liu Weiguang's First Division under Li's command were transferred from Zhangbei to Daqinggou (i.e., Shangyi), and Yin Baoshan's Second Division, originally stationed in Shangdu, also arrived in Baochang on the same day.

As for the Jehol puppet army, they are gradually advancing westward. Yu Zhishan's troops, more than 300 people, arrived in Baochang from Duolun on the 1st of this month, and Zhang Junzhe's troops, more than 700 people, arrived in Guyuan from Duolun. According to Shangdu news, the bandits and puppets once built an airport in Shangdu, but now it has been completely demolished, and all the aircraft have flown to Duolun. There are now more than 20 aircraft parked at the Duolun Airport. The situation between Nanhaokou and Xinghe is still tense in terms of the situation, but there has been no contact. However, there are occasional intermittent machine gun sounds in nearby villages, which are the bandits and puppets on the front line and rear of Nanhaokou arbitrarily conducting aimless exercises. Recently, there has been a rumor here that a certain party has a new attempt, which is to hand over the military power of all the bandits and puppet troops in northern Chahar to De Wang, imitating the illegal organization of Yin Rugeng in Jidong, and planning to build fortifications along the Great Wall on the border of Jehol as soon as spring warms up, in order to guard Jehol and shield the puppet state of "Manchukuo". Therefore, the bandit and puppet troops are transferred eastward, and the border between Suiyuan and Chahar is silent, which is a preliminary indication of a certain party. The rumors are like this, so I will record them to see what happens next.

De Wang's attitude has been quite negative recently, and the reason is unknown, but his subordinates, such as Bao Yueqing and Zhuo Shihai, are still trying to persuade him to get excited and continue to act recklessly. In addition, Tanaka, the chief of a certain secret service agency stationed in Jiabus, has ordered the three regiments of Wang Ying's troops, which have been downsized, to be placed under the command of De Wang. Regarding the deployment of the Mongolian-Jehol bandit and puppet troops in various defense areas and the selection of new commanders of each division, Tanaka convened a joint discussion among various councilors and commanders in Jiabus on the first day of this month, and is now proceeding step by step according to the agreed-upon method. (3rd)

### Anti-Smuggling Front of Industry and Commerce in Chao-Shan

Various industries have organized anti-smuggling associations; government strictly stipulates anti-smuggling measures

Shantou Communication: For years, smugglers and tax evaders who smuggle contraband goods and poisons along the coast of Shantou have relied on special backgrounds, coming in overwhelming waves. The Provincial Anti-Smuggling Office specially transferred a large team of anti-smuggling soldiers to Chao-Shan last month. Together with the tax police and the ban on smoking and smuggling inspection teams stationed in Shantou before, there are no less than 1,000 people, distributed in key waterways and land passes, setting up more than 50 inspection stations, and working together with the Chao-Hai customs officers, soldiers, warships, and boats to conduct a large-scale inspection, and the deployment is quite tight. In view of the seriousness of the intrusion of smuggled goods into the interior, the national tax revenue, the people's economy, and legitimate industry and commerce are all completely destroyed, the Chaozhou and Meizhou business community convened various trade associations in the winter of last year to organize individual anti-smuggling associations. Among the 54 associations in Shantou, 38 associations should be organized into anti-smuggling associations. Thirteen have already been organized. Each industry has also organized branch associations in various county towns, totaling more than 300. All legitimate stores must join as members, and the walls are tight, and the results are remarkable. However, the smuggling crooks, suffering from this blow, are trying to destroy the anti-smuggling front of merchants, instigating alienation, oppression, and biting, in an attempt to destroy it. Even the consul of a certain country came forward and protested, but the Shantou Chamber of Commerce still does not slacken the anti-smuggling work because of this, and convened another meeting of representatives of various trade associations on January 25 to decide to expand and consolidate the anti-smuggling front and carry out the organization of the Chao-Mei Joint Anti-Smuggling Association. All trade associations that have not established anti-smuggling associations must form them within seven days and submit them to the administrative office and the municipal government for record, and send letters to various trade unions to assist everything, so that smuggling crooks have no way to use their tricks. The Shantou civilian ships, steamers, transportation, loading and unloading, electric ships, seafarers, railways, highways, automobiles, and various trade unions, after receiving the letter from the Chamber of Commerce, specially established anti-smuggling associations immediately to prevent the sale of smuggled goods in the interior and consolidate the economic barriers. In particular, from then on, all workers will supervise and guarantee each other and will not transport goods handed over by suspected stores. Each trade union sends responsible personnel to various cities in the interior to establish branch associations in order to connect everything. Therefore, it is expected that from then on, smuggling crooks and smuggled goods will be even more unsuccessful.

Checking that the goods of smuggling crooks are mostly transported in from remote places along the coast, using special forces to cover up the sale in the interior. Even if they are caught by the inspection team

## Page 14

If the inspection team arrests them, they can also use the pretext of consular jurisdiction or trade agreement to extradite them back. In the Chao-Shan area, such international negotiations have repeatedly occurred, and it is difficult for the standing bureau to cope with them. If workers can assist the government, and automatically form anti-smuggling associations without being greedy for petty profits to transport goods for them, and merchants also automatically prevent smuggling and break ties with them, then smuggled goods cannot be transported and sold, and smuggling crooks have nothing to rely on to carry out their cunning plans. The civilian ship trade union has now received an order from the administrative office, designating the docking points for Chao-Shan inland river vessels to prevent them from connecting and transporting smuggled goods for smuggling crooks in remote places. The following locations have been designated, including the lower reaches of the Han River, which are Wuqiao, Bajiaoting, Huilanqiao, Railway Bridge in Shantou, Anbu, Meixitou, Nanjie, Congyuan, Tanghu, Yunbu in Chaoan, Xiasuimen, Xiangzi Bridge, Zhumumen, Guihu, Yixi in Chao City, etc. In addition, ships are not allowed to dock arbitrarily in other coastlines in order for the anti-smuggling team to check the above locations. If there is a failure and it is necessary to dock and stay overnight in the middle of the journey, the shipowner must first report to the nearby district office police station, and obtain permission from the reserve team headquarters before docking to prevent connecting and transporting smuggled goods. When the shipowner stays, the registration certificate number of the civilian ship trade union and the name of the shipowner must be registered at the permanent location before 9 pm, and a temporary docking registration certificate will be issued. When the military police get on board to check, the certificate must be handed over to check whether the number of people and goods on board are consistent. There are also detailed rules and regulations that have been issued today. After the establishment of the anti-smuggling associations for other steamships, highway automobile transportation workers, coal cargo loading and unloading workers, there are also detailed work regulations, which mutually supervise and abide by each other, so that everyone will not fall into injustice and suffer legal consequences. It has been implemented since January 28.

The Chao-Hai Customs has also issued a strict set of regulations on inspecting smuggled goods and giving rewards and punishments: (A) For incoming ships, if it is found that there are smuggled goods not on the manifest or those under-reported, the following penalties shall be imposed: (1) In minor cases, the deposit of the shipping company in the customs will be deducted according to the amount of the smuggled goods fine. (2) In serious cases, the business license issued by the customs to the company will be revoked. (B) For lighters loading goods in the port, if it is found that there is smuggling, the following penalties shall be imposed: (1) The smuggled goods will be confiscated and fined, regardless of who the owner of the goods is. (2) After confiscating the smuggled goods, the license will be revoked. (3) The smuggled goods and the lighter will be confiscated together, and the lighter will be sawed into two pieces and placed in front of the customs for public display. The above measures have long been implemented, and the previous order is now reiterated in order to unite officials and the people to strictly prevent smuggled goods.

### Fishing Industry in Coastal Areas of Fujian and Guangdong Invaded

Japanese fishing boats enter and exit coastal areas; our fishermen cannot compete

Xiamen Communication: The coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong are rich in aquatic products, but fishermen all stick to old ways, so the fishing industry cannot develop. In recent years, foreign fishing boats often intrude into our territorial waters to fish, and then sell them at low prices within our borders. Therefore, our country's fishing industry has been hit very hard. According to people in the Fishermen's Association, "Recently, Japan has established a joint fishing company in Hong Kong, which is quite large in scale. In the future, it plans to openly fish in our territorial waters. Since last summer, the number of Japanese fishing boats entering and exiting our coastal areas has been increasing daily. They use new equipment to catch large quantities. The sharp decline in the production of sharks this year is one proof of the deprivation of rights. Moreover, they sell the fish they catch at low prices in coastal towns within our borders, which is almost half the price of our fishermen. Therefore, most fish vendors are happy to sell them, and people are also happy to buy them because of the low price. In addition to fishing, these fishing boats also often patrol in the territorial waters, and whether there are any incidental effects is also a question. Now the fishing markets in the Fujian and Guangdong fishing areas are mostly occupied. The saltwater fresh fish sold on the market every day are all caught by Japanese fishing boats in our coastal areas and sold to us. The number of fish they transport to Taiwan is also not small." (February 5)

### Kunshan

Rural Medical Facilities

This county has paid little attention to rural medical and health facilities. This year, the county government plans to promote them, setting up one health center in each district. The district chief will also serve as the director of the center. The start-up cost is set at 300 yuan per center, and the operating expenses are 130 yuan per month. Each bao (neighborhood) will also set up first-aid kits and send personnel to manage them. It is now actively underway.

### Zhenjiang

Suggestion to Widen West Gate Street

Mubu West Gate Street is lined with shops and has always been a prosperous commercial area in Zhenjiang. However, the roads are narrow, and traffic is inconvenient. The city appearance is not tidy, and the commerce is also declining. The provincial capital planned to name it Daxilu, but the construction has not been implemented to date. If this road connects Shuangjing Road and Zhongshan Road, and connects Boxian Road and Baogai Road to the west, and penetrates Baota Road in the middle, there are Xinma Road on the left and Zhonghua Road on the right, all of which are very wide and accessible. Only this commercial center, West Gate Street, is still narrow as before. Not only is the market difficult to revitalize, but it also hinders the appearance of the provincial capital. It is really necessary to build it in advance. The Zhenjiang County Party Division and the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce yesterday specially presented letters to the Construction Department one after another, suggesting that the construction be carried out in advance in order to tidy up the city and revitalize commerce.

### Yangzhou

Chicken, Duck, and Goose Boat Capsized

At about 8 pm on the 4th, in Shiyanggou River, Shiyang Township, Fourth District, this county, a tugboat from Gaoyou, loaded with passengers, goods, and 1,000-odd chickens, ducks, and geese, passed by here and was transferred to Shanghai via Bagangkou. Unexpectedly, the ship was not cautious in its navigation and was capsized. Fortunately, it was rescued by a neighboring ship and no one was injured. However, the chickens, ducks, and geese were placed in cages and sank to the bottom of the river. When they were salvaged, they were completely drowned. The loss was about several hundred yuan. The next morning, the ship was salvaged and sailed away.

### Nantong

Aftermath of the Fire in Yaogang Town

A devastating fire occurred in Yaogang Town, destroying fifty-three homes and causing immense suffering. The Public Security Bureau is working with local gentry and merchants to organize relief efforts. The three individuals allegedly responsible for the fire – Li Deming, Li Xiaomei, and Guo Zhou – were detained by the mountain police on the 5th and handed over to the court's prosecutor's office for investigation.

Establishment of a News Censorship Office

The Fourth District Special Office has established a News Censorship Office. Staff from the Special Office, County Government, and Public Security Bureau will be jointly organized to conduct censorship of news published by local newspapers, starting from the 6th.

### Jiashan

Expansion and Construction of the Train Station

Opposition to Telephone Company Merger

The rural lines operated by the Siming Telephone Company derive all their resources from the users. When the lines were installed, there was a verbal contract between the two parties. Now, the Provincial Construction Department intends to transfer the management of these lines to the Provincial Bureau, ordering the company to comply. Subsequently, the users convened a meeting and, arguing that transferring the lines to the Provincial Bureau would cause much inconvenience in telephone services, representatives led by Zhu Chunyi submitted a letter to the company outlining six reasons to persuade the Provincial Department to reconsider.

Firecracker Paper Furnace Bomb Injures Person

At the foot of Lijiaya Wa Bridge in Cibei, Li built a furnace for burning waste paper, which was used by villagers to burn paper with writing on it. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, an old man carrying a load of paper for burning poured it into the furnace. As the flames were burning brightly, the old man saw some scraps of paper on the ground and threw them into the furnace. Unexpectedly, a loud bang suddenly erupted in the furnace, and the old man's hands were blackened, and his face was injured simultaneously. The furnace was also cracked by the explosion. A cloud of gunpowder permeated the air, revealing that it was a bomb explosion. Fortunately, the explosive force was not strong, and the old man's injuries were minor.

### Hangzhou

Reduced Combination Fertilization

The sales volume of ammonium sulfate in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been enormous over the years. In recent years, the Construction Departments of the two provinces have paid considerable attention to chemical fertilizers, so regulations have been established. In Zhejiang Province, it was originally stipulated that every 100 dan of ammonium sulfate should be combined with 73 dan of mixed fertilizer. However, after implementation, farmers generally found it difficult. It is heard that there are petitions to reduce the combination to be more economical. According to a person in charge of a certain agricultural organization in the province, this combination should be based on soil tests in various regions. Since the soil composition of the whole province is not uniform, it is inappropriate to stipulate that every 100 dan should be combined with 73 dan. Moreover, the amount of the combination is also too high, which is not very economical. The previous regulations were probably a kind of test. Now that farmers feel difficult, the Construction Department can consider reducing it appropriately.

The booming trend on the trading floor is quite impressive. Although large financial investors had substantial sales, they were not affected due to the strong market sentiment and the large number of buyers. Consolidated bonds have all reached a one-month peak. The 6th of this week was a holiday, so there was no market activity. Business will resume on the 15th, but because people are quite optimistic about the red market, the future will be promising. The entire week's progress: on Monday, short covering was strong, and 43, 32, and other firms sold off, and market prices slightly declined. The Gold Construction Bond declined by 0.8 yuan. On Tuesday, market conditions were extremely dull, and trading was still focused on short covering. Market prices fluctuated, showing a rotating state.

### Yarn & Cotton

Trading in Current Yarn and Cotton is Weak

Because of the processing of the final accounting procedures, the yarn standard yarn and cotton market has stopped trading in the market on the 5th. But a part of current yarn merchants still went to the market to do business. However, the customer gangs are busy with the closing at the end of the year, and they have very little capital, so the trading is not prosperous. According to the statistics, each gang bought 505 bales, and the selling price was average. The buying frequency of each gang is as follows:

The cotton market is calm. Because American cotton and Indian cotton have declined, people's hearts are discouraged. The current cotton consumption is becoming more sluggish. The yarn factory workers have several days of holidays, so the demand for raw materials is even less. Most of the inland cotton firms have stopped weighing, so the source is even more scarce. Yaohua arrived with 100 small bales, and Tonghua arrived with 88 bales.

The Net Inventory of Standard Yarn and Cotton is Reduced

Yarn 104,250 bales, Cotton 334,100 dan

American Cotton Buyers Seem to Be Wary

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened sluggish, with all months down 1 to 4 points. Traders were watching the sale of pledged cotton. Prices were weak due to poor Liverpool telegrams. Longs closed positions, and demand decreased. The hedging of pledged cotton did not have pressure. The flood situation is improving, and the weak stock market and cold hearts of buyers were also the reason for the sluggish market. However, the cloth market has been more active after recent price drops. The closing was flat and weak. Spot prices fell 5 points, and futures prices fell 3 to 7 points. English cotton spot prices fell 5 points, and futures prices fell 3 to 4 points.

### Sugar Market

Chaoqing Sugar Production Telegram Shows a Rebound of 0.2 Yuan

Yesterday, with the deadline for major settlements approaching, the sugar industry stabilized. The association's listed prices, such as 24 coarse sand, Dongbai 489, Mian Zhenji, Jinxin Dahua, etc., mostly called for the original price without much change. The listed prices were uniformly suspended due to the settlement relationship. However, it was heard that since the decline of Chaoqing, all parties have been purchasing. Now that the goods arriving are scarce, yesterday's telegram showed a rebound of 0.2 yuan. If the Zhuangqing price is to be raised to 14 yuan, the rest will be refunded. It was also heard that Zhangdiaoging was being purchased by Shantou gangs, and the market has also tightened.

### Food

With the End of the Period Approaching, the Zhabei Rice Market Transactions are Even More Clear

White Glutinous Rice Owners Seek to Sell at a Slightly Lower Price

Yesterday, in the Shanghai North Rice Market, because the settlement period was approaching, and boats coming from various gangs downstream were lacking, transactions of various goods in the market were sparse. The market shape was slightly uneven. Those who wanted to sell white glutinous rice were offering prices slightly lower. Customers insisted on hard rice, so prices were stable. Early rice and various Xian rice prices were fixed. Thin rice was average, and Baiyuan's arrival was at a favorable price of 0.035 yuan, and the prices of other goods were unchanged. There were about 70-80 boats stored downstream. All rice shops will be closed and stop measuring from today.

### Joint Petition from Chambers of Commerce in Various Regions to Amend Various Provisions of the Income Tax

Three Concerning the Regulations, Two Concerning the Detailed Rules, and Five Concerning the Draft Collection Guidelines

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously convened chambers of commerce from various counties and towns along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines, as well as various trade associations in the city, to hold an income tax research meeting. After detailed discussion, various opinions were decided, and the income tax specialist committee of the chamber of commerce organized them according to their nature. For those concerning the provisional regulations, a petition was submitted to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Ministry of Finance. For those concerning the implementing rules, a petition was submitted to the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance. For those concerning the draft collection guidelines, a letter was sent to the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, requesting adoption and revision. The submitted letter was dispatched yesterday. The original text is recorded as follows:

Concerning the Provisional Regulations

Presenting a petition: Since the implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations on January 1st of this year, the severity of tax rates and the complexity of implementation procedures have been of great concern to the business community. The association therefore invited chambers of commerce from various counties and towns along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, as well as various trade associations in Shanghai, to hold an income tax research meeting on January 20th. Representatives from various chambers of commerce and trade associations attended upon invitation and, after detailed discussion, believed that the tax is a new establishment and the current regulations still have room for improvement. In addition to the opinions on the implementing rules and collection guidelines, which are submitted separately to the competent authorities for approval, the points concerning the provisional regulations that should be added, deleted, or amended are summarized and presented to your Yuan (Ministry). ㊀ Taxation should be based on the principle of fair burden. Article 3 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations adopts a full progressive system for income items A and B, while Article 5, Category 2, salary and remuneration income adopts a progressive system exceeding the limit. Compared with each other, the full progressive system is far less fair than the progressive system exceeding the limit. For example, if a company has a capital of 3 million yuan and a public reserve of 1 million yuan, with one-third incorporated into the capital, the total capital is 3,333,333.33 yuan. If the profit is 499,999.99 yuan, it should be taxed at 40 per mille according to Article 3, Section 2, paying a tax of 20,000 yuan. If the profit is 500,000 yuan, it should be changed to 60 per mille according to Article 3, Section 3, paying a total tax of 30,000 yuan. The difference of one point in profit results in an increase of 10,000 yuan in tax payment, which is the disadvantage of the full progressive system. If a progressive system exceeding the limit is adopted, there will be no such drawbacks. It is requested that your Yuan (Ministry) consider amending it, point 1. ㊁ The progressive tax rate for Category 2 income is divided into ten levels, while the tax rate for Category 1 income items A and B is only divided into five levels. The progressive tax rate for each level differs by only 10 per mille from the first level to the second level. From the second level to the fifth level, the tax increases by 20 per mille per level, and the distance is also too large. Store profits are usually from 8 per mille to 10 per mille at most. If the settlement only yields 5 per mille interest, the official profit will not be enough to distribute, and shareholders will be greatly disappointed. Now, the starting point for taxation of Category 1 income items A and B is 5 per mille interest, which is too strict. It should be changed to a starting point of 10 per mille. Combining the above situations, the grading of tax rates in Article 3, the distance between each grade, and the starting point all need to be widened. It is requested that your Yuan (Ministry) consider amending it, point 2. ㊂ Regarding Category 1 salary income: (A) The current regulations stipulate that the starting point for taxation is a monthly income of 30 yuan. Considering the living conditions of urban civilians, this amount is not enough to support a family of eight. Taxing it suddenly seems inappropriate. It is found that the income tax regulations originally proposed a starting point of 50 yuan in the draft. For the sake of fair burden, it is still necessary to change the starting point to 50 yuan. (B) Recently, those engaged in various industries, their employers, have compulsory savings measures. The intention is to prevent unemployment and disability from being unable to support themselves in the future. Considering its nature, it is to replace the social donations of pensions, old-age pensions, and alimony in the future. They belong to the same social relief undertakings. The difference is that one is a prior plan, and the other is a post-donation. They should be rewarded equally. The principal should be exempted from tax according to item 2, Section 2, Mao. The interest should be exempted from tax according to item 2, Category 3, statutory savings. (C) Life insurance money, its intention is to seek self-sufficiency in the aftermath and reduce the burden of social assistance. In advanced countries, their people's wealth is far better than ours. When planning personal income tax, the life insurance money used each year is still excluded. Our country should not be solely strict at present. It is requested to add a life insurance money item under item 2, Category 2 income in Article 1. The amount obtained when the insurance expires or the compensation obtained after death, if the amount is only enough for old-age care when there is no ability to live, or for alimony when the surviving family has no ability to live, then the situation is the same as item 2, Category 2 income, although one is a lump sum deposit and the other is a zero payment, but the actual monthly income may not be able to exceed item 2, and the situation is completely different from the huge pensions of the customs and post office. The regulations do not have any rules for tax exemption, which is a omission. It is requested to supplement and amend it. It is requested that your Yuan (Ministry) consider adopting it, point 3. The above articles are based on the joint resolution of representatives from the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce, Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, Changshu County Chamber of Commerce, Qingpu County Chamber of Commerce, Kunshan County Chamber of Commerce, Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, Wujin County Chamber of Commerce, Fengxian County Chamber of Commerce, Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and various industry associations who attended the Income Tax Research Meeting. However, because the representatives have returned to their hometowns after the meeting, the association is submitting another petition based on the above resolutions and will not list the names of the representatives. It is hoped that your Yuan (Ministry) will review, approve, and adopt the implementation for the convenience of the public.

Concerning the Implementing Rules

(Above omitted) The points concerning the scope of the implementing rules that should be added, deleted, or amended are summarized and presented to your Yuan and Ministry. ㊀ Article 7, Section 6 of the Implementing Rules states that those with public reserves may calculate one-third of the total amount into the capital, which seems inappropriate. The deposit of public reserves increases the store's financial resources in order to meet the needs of turnover. In terms of not distributing it to shareholders, it is the same as the new capital invested in the store by shareholders. Now it is restricted and only one-third is allowed to be incorporated into the capital, which does not seem to understand its meaning. If it is said that this restricts the arbitrary expansion of its capital in order to prevent the tax rate from increasing proportionally, then shareholders in ordinary psychology will rather distribute more dividends for use and are determined not to arbitrarily increase public reserves and put them in the middle ground. If the store wants to reduce the progressive tax rate by increasing capital, it does not need to increase the public reserve and directly use the capital increase procedure. The law allows it to be free and there is no restriction, and the purpose of restricting the incorporation of public reserves into capital may not be thoroughly implemented. It is requested that your Ministry delete the words "one-third" in item 2 of the article and change it to those with public reserves may calculate the total amount into the capital. ㊁ Article 26 of the Implementing Rules states that Category 1 income items A and B are paid annually, and Category 2 income is paid monthly. However, the tax amount for Category 2 salary income is extremely small. Monthly declaration, withholding, and carrying to the tax collection agency for payment are not worth the effort. It is requested to allow annual payment. It is requested that your Ministry add supplementary regulations to item 2 of the article, "paid monthly," in order to take both sides into account. (Below omitted)

Concerning the Collection Guidelines

(Above omitted) Regarding the draft collection guidelines for income tax, it is requested that your office accommodate the opinions of the business community and酌量consider adding, deleting, and amending them. The points are presented to your office in sections. ㊀ Article 5 of the draft collection guidelines for Category 1 operating income states, "The public reserve mentioned in Article 7, Section 2 of the Implementing Rules is limited to the public reserve stipulated by laws and regulations." The scope is too narrow. Article 7, Section 1 of the Implementing Rules includes both company organizations and other organizations other than companies. The so-called "those with public reserves" in Section 2 of the article naturally includes other organizations other than companies. Now, if it is limited to the public reserve stipulated by laws and regulations, then other organizations such as factories, stores, and firms that deposit public reserves or use the name of retained earnings, without the name of public reserves, but with the reality of public reserves, will all be regarded as public reserves not stipulated by laws and regulations and cannot be used as capital calculation. The treatment is too unequal, and it does not seem to conform to the original intention of Article 7 of the Implementing Rules, which seems to change the law by order. These non-company organizations such as factories, stores, and firms account for a very large part in both urban and inland areas today. It is requested that your office delete the words "limited to the public reserve stipulated by laws and regulations" in Article 5 of the draft collection guidelines and change it to all public reserves, retained earnings, and reserve funds of a public reserve nature belong to it. ㊁ Article 12 of the draft collection guidelines, income that cannot be considered necessary and reasonable expenses and losses in business, its second item is the profits allocated by assistants and other employees. In order to encourage the work efficiency of partners and employees, stores and factories often give low fixed monthly salaries and preferential annual profit sharing. The main purpose is to hope that the service will be more diligent. Therefore, from this point of view, it is equivalent to the unfixed salary given by the store. Now, if this is not recognized as a reasonable expense, it seems to be incompatible with business conditions. From the point of view of the partners and employees themselves, the profits allocated are originally the income of Category 2从事从事从事从事从事从事从事从事从业从业从业者報酬者報酬者報酬of the reward. The income tax should have been withheld and paid on behalf of the store at the time of allocation. Now, before the allocation, it is first included under the name of the store to deduct the profit income tax. It can be allocated to the profits of伙衣购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工购工工It is no less than deducting the payment twice first, which seems to be the opposite of the individual business income, which only needs to pay taxes once. It is requested that your office delete the nine words "assistants and other employees" under the shareholders, directors, and supervisors in item 2 of the article. Also, item 3 of Article 12 of the draft states that free donations are also considered unnecessary losses in business. Although the theory is correct, the actual situation is slightly inconsistent. In recent years, such as purchasing machinery for birthday congratulations, donations for disaster relief, and donations for援绥援绥援绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥绥

### Banking Association Obeys Orders to Distribute Income Tax Forms

Separate Notifications to All Banks to Reprint and Use Immediately

The Shanghai Banking Association, in order to distribute the forms for withholding income tax on company dividends and bond interest, has specifically sent letters to its member banks to reprint and use them separately. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To whom it may concern: We have recently received letter No. 21 from the Income Tax Office, stating, 'Regarding the Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Affairs Office's telegram, all three categories of income tax have now been fully levied. However, the previously issued 'Report Form for Deposit Income (Type D)' used a method of calculating income by household, which required a great deal of paper. Recently, a new method has been established for the collection of this income tax, and the original report form is no longer applicable and should be abolished. Our office has revised it and prepared a withholding form, which is attached. After receiving this report form and withholding form, please announce it to the public,' etc. Therefore, in addition to publishing it in the newspaper, we are sending five copies each of the newly issued Report Form for Deposit Interest (Type D) and the Type 3 Income Tax Withholding Form for your association to review and forward to its members for their own reprinting and use." We have checked that the Report Form for Deposit Interest (Type D) and the withholding form have already been distributed by our association on the 2nd of this month. We are now sending one copy each of the Company Dividend and Company Bond Interest Income Tax Withholding Form separately for your review and distribution. We hope you will receive them and reprint them for use."

### Railway Bureau Prepares to Add Hangzhou Express Train

Trial Run the Day Before Yesterday Shows Excellent Results

After the Shanghai-Nanjing and Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration opened the Capital Express train on New Year's Day this year, operating once a day between Nanjing and Shanghai, it has been fully booked each time, with good results.

In the future, there will also be one round trip per day.

### Wang Chonghui Speaks

National Committee member Wang Chonghui met with reporters from the New Voice Society at his residence last night. According to his remarks, the Shaanxi-Gansu problem has been resolved peacefully and there are no more issues. Regarding the current labor observation stronghold, after the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, the government organization will remain the same. Li Delin has decided to go to Nanjing to attend, while Bai Chongxi must stay in Guangxi to preside over everything. Xiao Focheng is ill and has not yet recovered, so he may not be able to return to the country in time. Wang himself has not yet prepared any proposals for the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. He plans to go to Nanjing on the 11th or 12th and, after exchanging views with various parties in Nanjing, plans to jointly propose proposals. Central Committee members Xie Chi and Yang Shukan, who are in Shanghai, are both ill and may not be able to go to Nanjing to attend. Wang also spoke about the new cabinet of Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro, saying that its organization is not sound, such as the selection of the foreign minister, which is problematic. There are rumors that Ambassador to the United States Saito and Ambassador to Italy Sato will be promoted. He knows both Saito and Sato. Saito was originally the Minister to the Netherlands and was suddenly made the Ambassador to the United States. He is a rapidly advancing figure in the Japanese diplomatic world and an active advocate for China.

### Parents' Association Petitions the Government to Regulate Children's Clothing

The Association will remove their membership and abandon them. The above is the resolution on children's clothing. In addition, the Association also resolved to appoint Zhou Shang and his wife to draft a concrete plan for expanding the organization, to appoint Chen Zhengfan to draft a concrete plan for publishing the "Parents' Yearbook," and to appoint Hu Zuyin to contact and liaise with You Huaigao, the editor of Family Weekly, etc.

### National Goods Joint Venture Company Elects Committee Members; Enthusiastic Subscription from All Parties

The China National Goods Joint Venture Company, appointed by the National Economic Construction Association, selected Huang Yanpei and 15 others as standing committee members of the preparatory office. The first meeting was held in Nanjing on the 5th. The committee members in Shanghai went to Nanjing to attend and returned to Shanghai on the Capital Express and the night express train on the same day. The Central News Agency reporters interviewed the committee members separately and learned that the preparatory office has set up a secretariat in Nanjing and an office in Shanghai, with the committee members in both places responsible separately to avoid the trouble of convening meetings.

Type A stipulates that each factory is limited to subscribing for 20,000 yuan. The subscription period is from the 20th to the 28th of this month, and the payment period is from the 10th to the 25th of March. Type B has no time limit or fixed amount.

### It is Improper for Chinese Merchants to Use the Name of Foreign Merchants to Avoid Income Tax

Shen Liren Says It is a Business Obstacle and Hopes Chinese Merchants Will Fulfill Their National Tax Obligations

Accountant Shen Liren said to the New News Agency reporter yesterday, "Since our country began collecting income tax, all sectors of industry and commerce have sympathized with the authorities. However, there are still significant problems regarding foreign people with consular jurisdiction in Shanghai. If consular jurisdiction cannot be resolved temporarily, then the event of Chinese merchants using the name of foreign merchants is unavoidable. Recently, it has been heard that a few foreign lawyers have intensified their efforts to lure Chinese-run companies into using the name of foreign merchants to avoid income tax, which hinders the prospects of our country's income tax and is no small matter. The meaning of income tax, from a principle point of view, is that the government is one of the shareholders in terms of profitable enterprises, and the government is one of the families in terms of salary remuneration, so there is the name of direct tax. In the implementation of income tax, the government and taxpayers have a close relationship. The increase in people's production will naturally increase the country's revenue, which can revitalize the industry internally and consolidate national defense externally, so that our country's position in the international arena will increase. As far as private individuals are concerned, although the country's expenses should be borne by the people, it is also common psychology to take care of oneself before the country. All countries do the same, and tax evasion is one aspect of it. However, there are two types of tax evasion: legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion. Today, the method of using the name of foreign merchants by Chinese merchants to avoid taxes is actually harmful to the national system. Citizens have the obligation to pay taxes, and the government has the responsibility to protect the people. Taking advantage of extraterritoriality and using the name of foreign merchants to avoid income tax is a great shame. Moreover, even if it is a business run by Chinese people, using the name of foreign merchants, if problems occur, such as debt lawsuits, the government will not accept it. At this time, the loss is incomparable to the amount of income tax that should be paid. As mentioned above, the use of the name of foreign merchants by Chinese merchants is actually a business obstacle. From my own observation, our country's international status has increased in recent years, and various foreign problems will inevitably be resolved in the near future. At that time, the implementation of income tax can be said to be universal both at home and abroad, and it will be futile for Chinese merchants to use the name of foreign merchants."

### Centenary of Pushkin's Death

Sino-Soviet Cultural Association to Hold a General Assembly on Schedule

February 10th marks the centenary of the death of the great Russian poet Pushkin. Pushkin was the leader of the Russian literary world in the early 19th century. At that time, everything in Tsarist Russia was bound by foreign forces, and it was a period of rule by European thought and opinions. Pushkin believed that literature was an important tool for national revival. Therefore, a century ago, he devoted himself to using words to judge Tsarist Russia and move towards the path of revolution, laying the foundation for the establishment of the Soviet Union a century later. The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association will hold a commemorative meeting at the Shanghai Theatre on North Sichuan Road at 3:00 p.m. on the 10th. Invitations have been sent to all sectors to participate. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Schirwindt-Altwatter, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in China, will attend and deliver speeches. Famous Chinese and Soviet artists will jointly perform musical pieces, and a Soviet-produced film of Pushkin's famous works will be screened at the same time for commemoration. A grand occasion is predicted.

### Local Goods Association Sends Letter to Soldier Training Council to Provide Local Cloth Uniforms

The Shanghai China Local Goods Promotion Association, in view of the fact that many of the uniforms of the soldiers in various counties contain non-national goods, which is detrimental to the national spirit and national economy, specifically sent letters to the soldier training committees of various counties yesterday, requesting the promotion of local cloth. The original letter reads: "To whom it may concern: Since the start of soldier training, the national spirit has been greatly invigorated. However, the required uniforms are all contracted and made by clothing merchants, and the materials are not uniform, so it is inevitable that non-national goods are mixed in, which is detrimental to the appearance and causes the loss of the national economy. The local cloth in this area, although the organization is rough, is durable. Using it as a uniform not only saves money, but also helps to save the country with national goods. Now that the third phase of soldier training is about to begin, the clothing of each school must be prepared in a timely manner. We hereby send this letter, hoping that you will review and adopt it to promote it, to the benefit of all."

### Chinese Cultural Construction Association Hosts Banquet for Gao Yuzhu and Yu Jiecai

Pan Gongzhan Delivers Welcome Speech; Representatives Gao and Yu Report

The Chinese Cultural Construction Association held a banquet at Lake Society yesterday at 7:00 p.m. to welcome Gao Yuzhu Tusi, a representative of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups in southwestern China, and Mr. Yu Jiecai. Those present included Wang Boqi, Ou Yuanhuai, Huang Renzhi, Hu Pu'an, Weng Zhilong, He Shuangqiu, Shu Xincheng, Fan Zhongyun, Zhang Yousan, Feng Youzhen, Qian Cangshuo, Huang Jingwan, Jiang Jianbai, Zhang Binghui, Lan Hu, Qian Jiuwei, Jin Guangmei, Tian Chuqing, Zhou Hanmei, and more than thirty others. The secretary-general of the association, Pan Gongzhan, delivered a welcome speech first.

Pan Gongzhan's Speech

Today, the Chinese Cultural Construction Association has invited the directors in Shanghai, as well as the leaders of the press, publishing, and education circles, to welcome Gao Yuzhu Tusi, a representative of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups in southwestern China, and Mr. Yu Jiecai. This has an unusually profound and significant meaning, which is by no means comparable to ordinary socializing. Because China is an oppressed nation, if we want to complete the national revival movement, all our compatriots must work together to move forward. Tusi Gao represents the 200,000 Miao and Yi people in the southwest, and we are deeply encouraged to be able to gather together at this time. The purpose of the Cultural Construction Association is to promote our country's inherent culture, absorb advanced foreign culture, and combine them into one to suit the national conditions, improve the cultural level, and create our Republic of China as a modern country. To achieve this goal, the constituent elements of our Chinese nation must first and foremost reach a consistent level of culture. Due to inconvenient transportation and other reasons, the culture of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups is slightly behind. The association and its branches in various provinces and cities, taking cultural construction as their duty, should do their best to contribute their efforts. All members of the cultural circles of the country will inevitably share this responsibility and work together to ensure that all ethnic groups in the country not only achieve equal political and economic status, but also equal cultural status. Secondly, we hope that Tusi Gao and Mr. Yu will report more about the situation and crisis of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups so that all sectors of society can understand them. Because we deeply feel that the reason why the Miao and Yi ethnic groups have not yet reached the level of civilization and progress today is that the people of the whole country have not fulfilled their responsibilities. If we had paid attention to it earlier, then we would not have waited for Mr. Gao and Mr. Yu to come from thousands of miles away. To make up for this shortcoming, we should get up and catch up. Today, there are those in the education sector. In the future, if universities can recruit more children from the Miao and Yi ethnic groups to study, just like National Jinan University and overseas Chinese, then it goes without saying that the Miao and Yi youths will benefit the Miao and Yi ethnic groups after receiving the cultivation of new education. There are those in the press circles, so they should strive to report the true situation of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups to the people of the whole country for common attention. There are those in the publishing circles, so they should strive to transport various publications to the border areas for propaganda and to promote their cooperation and progress. Success will be achieved. It is by no means difficult to bring the 20 million compatriots of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups to the level of culture. Finally, I wish Gao Tusi and Mr. Yu good health and cherish the country.

Gao Yuzhu's Speech

Today, I am honored to be invited to a banquet by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association and to gather with the cultural circles of Shanghai. At the same time, I am also extremely ashamed, because the 20 million compatriots of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups have not yet been able to reach cultural equality with all ethnic groups in the country. I am extremely ashamed. Today, I am encouraged by everyone and will work hard to move forward in order to live up to the kindness of all the gentlemen in supporting and encouraging me. There are many reasons why the culture of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups is underdeveloped. First, there is inconvenient communication, that is, there is the obstruction of heavy mountains and ridges, and the means of transportation are very primitive. They are confined to one corner, and knowledge is not easy to open up. Second, there is the invasion of imperialists. The imperialists have the ambition to invade and use the means of division and alienation, which not only stagnates the culture of our Miao and Yi people without progress, but also creates all kinds of barriers and misunderstandings between the Han and Yi and the Han and Miao people. It is painful to speak of it. Third, because our country is vast and there are frequent internal disturbances, the central government cannot fully take care of the border areas. Therefore, the Miao and Yi people have made little progress for thousands of years. The lack of progress of the 20 million people of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups is a huge loss to our country and a huge crisis to our country. Now the National Government and people from all walks of life in the country have deeply concerned about them. I am very grateful. I sincerely hope that our government and compatriots will have practical assistance measures for the Miao and Yi compatriots in this deep water. Whether it is economy or talent, I hope there will be sufficient relief. Once the rich resources and abundant products hidden in the southwest are developed, the contribution to our country and nation will be no small matter. There are so many things to report that I cannot describe them all in a hurry. When I have another opportunity, I will report them in detail to the people of the country. Yu Jiecai, Ou Yuanhuai, Shu Xincheng, Hu Lan, Jiang Jianbai, Zhang Yousan, etc. also made speeches. The speeches are omitted due to length.

### Tongru Chonghai Qi Fellow-Provincials Association Sends Letter Requesting Strict Handling of Theft Cases

The Tongru Chonghai Qi Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Commissioner of Nantong, stating, "Commissioner Yichun, with respect: Nantong has a simple and honest custom and has always been known as easy to govern. In recent years, evil theories have been eroding and the atmosphere has gradually changed. The cunning seek undue desires, and the mediocre become accustomed to opportunistic behavior, resulting in rampant bandits and unrest among the people. According to reports in the past two months, more than ten cases have occurred in Xiangxue Township in the first district, Xinhe Township in the second district, Yongfeng Fuxing Township in the third district, and Di Dongnan Shabawan Bridge Township in the sixth district. The number of unrecorded cases may be ten times higher than this. Officials lack security measures, and the people lack self-defense methods. Looking north to our homeland, our deep worries cannot be ended. Our association has gathered together to discuss and respectfully offer our humble opinions. To manage the country, settling the people is the top priority. To settle the people, managing theft is the most important thing. The current theft situation mostly originates locally and does not involve new weapons. The poor break into houses and boldly commit theft. When they come out and discard their weapons, they still pretend to be civilians. The families in the countryside who have been stolen from often fear the trouble of going to the government and the terrible revenge of reporting the theft. Therefore, only one in ten report the case, and only one in ten of those reported are solved, and only one in ten of those solved are prosecuted. Failing to severely punish theft is no different from rewarding lazy people for stealing. The current law regards catching thieves as an administrative responsibility, while the trial is the responsibility of the judiciary. The judiciary pays attention to evidence, and it often takes a year to conclude a case. The families who have been stolen from do not want to endure the hardship of running around, and in the end, not only do they not get compensated for their losses, but they may also be burdened by lawsuits, increasing their losses. Therefore, they endure the pain and dare not do more. Today, the authorities have a clear understanding of the people's suffering and are striving to effectively manage theft. They should apply the regulations for managing bandits, and theft cases should be handled by administrative officials. Your Excellency is stationed in our county and has always attached great importance to security. You must order your subordinates that if theft cases occur in the future, in addition to the parties involved, the heads of townships, towns, and baojia must also be responsible for reporting the case. After the case is reported, the detective agency should be ordered to solve the case within a time limit. Once the thief is found and questioned, he should be punished according to the law without leniency. Those who report the case will not have the burden of officials, and those who steal will fear severe punishment. The ancients said, "The purpose of punishment is to eliminate punishment." Theft will cease, and the people can live in peace. Your virtue is boundless. Are these appropriate? We respectfully ask for your judgment. With respects to you, the Tongru Chonghai Qi Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, February of the 26th year."

### Bank Manager Chen Xunru Murders

He Blamed Liang Chenlan for a Debt of 30,000 Yuan; Police Must Investigate Whether it was Suicide or Murder

Jianzhong Bank is located at No. 144 at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Tianjin Road. Chen Xunru, a native of Huzhou, has held the position of General Manager. Chen was originally from a prominent family in Huzhou, and in recent years, he has also enjoyed a good reputation in the financial circles of this port. There was a man named Liang Chenlan from Ningbo, who used to be the manager of Qianyi Silver Company. Due to frequent interactions, they became close friends. A few years ago, Qianyi Silver Company went bankrupt, and Liang was also heavily in debt. Because of the urgent demands from various parties, he could not cope, so he sought help from Chen Xunru, borrowing 30,000 national currency yuan from Chen himself to overcome the difficulties. At that time, Liang also promised to repay it within six months. Unexpectedly, Liang ignored it when the deadline arrived. Although Chen repeatedly urged him, he first made excuses and then avoided meeting him, leaving Chen with no way to deal with it. Recently, as the end of the lunar year approached, Chen was also in urgent need of funds and lacked flexibility in his turnover. He had no choice but to bring up the old case again. Yesterday at around 12:30 pm, he privately borrowed a service pistol from Ma Qi Huan, the gatekeeper of Jianzhong Bank, and went alone to No. 25, Lane 316, Henan Road, the former site of Qianyi Silver Company, to demand repayment from Liang. Who knew that Liang had no sincerity at all and continued to prevaricate. Chen, feeling anxious about his personal circumstances, external reputation, and future prospects, immediately drew his gun and fired a shot at Liang. However, Liang dodged quickly and was not hit. Chen then used the gun in his other hand to fire a shot at his own head. He fell to the ground with a loud noise, his brains and blood splattering everywhere. He died instantly. At that time, employees of the British-owned condensed milk company next to the Qianyi Silver Company, hearing the sudden gunshot, mistakenly thought it was a robbery and quickly pressed the alarm. As a result, detectives arrived in no time. After investigation, they realized that it was a homicide case and not a robbery alarm. Liang was still in the room, looking dumbfounded. He was immediately arrested and taken to the police station. After interrogation, he provided the above account. However, the police believe that it is necessary to investigate whether Chen's shooting was suicide or murder. Therefore, they ordered Liang Chenlan to be detained temporarily. At the same time, Chen's body was sent to the coroner's office for examination and his family was notified to claim the body and prepare for burial.

### Heavy Fog in This Port Yesterday Morning

Import Vessels Were All Obstructed; Fine Rain Fell After the Fog

Since the solar term "Start of Spring" on the fourth day of this month, the weather in this port has been unusually warm, with the south wind blowing, giving a sense of spring returning to the vast land. Yesterday morning, a heavy fog suddenly arose, making it impossible to distinguish people within a short distance. At the same time, the humidity was quite high, and the ground was damp, as if it had been rained on. The reporter went to the Bund Customs in the fog to inquire. Since 6:00 am, no ships had entered the port because they were blocked by the fog and stopped outside the Wusongkou. Export ships were also temporarily suspended due to the heavy fog. This state of maritime blockade continued until 9:30 am when it returned to normal. Ships then successively entered and exited the port. At the same time, the take-off time of the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou-Xian flight was also slightly delayed. Furthermore, fine rain fell after the fog dissipated, and the weather gradually became unstable.

### Witnesses in the Yin Bengen Assassination Case Describe Tall and Short Men

Wang Dianhua Retracts His Confession; Shao Wangshi Identifies Him; Testimony on How They Dragged Yin at the Time

The case of Anhui native Yin Bengen, a detective's associate, who was assassinated to death on the night of October 11th last year in Qianjiatang, French Concession, is now being handled by the French police. The murderers, Anhui native Wang Dianhua, also known as Wang Laowu, Ma Changshou, also known as Ma Hanqing, and suspect Wu Weicai have been arrested and sent to the Special No. 2 Court for prosecution and interrogation according to law. Wang Dianhua confessed that he, together with the fugitive Wang Kaifu and Ma Changshou, had committed the shooting. After being sent to the detention center, he suddenly retracted his confession during further interrogation, claiming that it was due to torture and unbearable suffering that he confessed to the various details. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Liao of the Criminal Division came to the Second Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought in for further trial. Wang Dianhua still retracted his previous confession, denying participation in the killing of Yin Bengen. He stated, "I do not know Wang Kaifu and Ma Changshou. Yin Chenshi, the wife of the deceased, said at the police station that my husband, Yin Bengen, was beaten to death by me, Wang Kaifu, and Ma Changshou. So I confessed according to her words. In fact, Yin Chenshi has a grudge against me. She originally had a husband but had an affair with Yin and framed me out of spite. I request a detailed investigation." Ma Changshou and Wu Weicai also categorically denied the murder. According to witness Shao Wangshi's testimony, Yin ran from west to east at the time, reaching my house and stepping into the gate. Then a tall man, the defendant in the case (pointing to Wang Dianhua), told a short man to drag Yin out, and held a gun to scare me, forbidding me from making any noise. I then lay on the ground and saw the short man unable to drag Yin out. The tall man then fired three shots and turned to run out, still heading west. I then followed out and called the patrolmen to report. At that time, I clearly saw the face of the tall man. It was him (pointing to Wang Dianhua). I did not see the short man clearly, etc. After reviewing the testimony in court, the judge announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the 26th to summon witnesses for further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Lu Genlin Impersonates Zhang Yipeng to Deceive Six Female Employees of Escort Agencies

Dozens of Others Have Also Been Deceived; More Cases Are Expected Next Time

Lu Genlin, a 25-year-old Shanghai native, went to the Sanmin Massage Parlor at No. 5, Lane 442, Haining Road, on the 19th of last month, impersonating the famous Peking Opera actor Zhang Yipeng and defrauded Zhou Xiaomei, Li Axiang, and Wang Gendi, female masseuses of the parlor, of a gold ring each before fleeing. Subsequently, detective Zhang Desheng and Zhang Yaoji of the Hongkou Police Station arrested Lu and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. According to the investigation conducted by the detectives handling the case, it was learned that Lu specifically went to various parlors, opened rooms, and called female employees of various escort agencies to come. He would then ask the women to take a bath or use names such as inviting them to watch a play to trick them into handing over their clothes and jewelry. The temporarily discovered cases are recorded below: ㊀ At 10:30 pm on the 12th of last month, in room 216 of the New Asia Hotel, he defrauded Zhang Mali of the Taoyuan Escort Agency at No. 436 Hankou Road and Liang Ping of the Lelu Escort Agency at No. 260 Jiujiang Road of two wristwatches and two gold rings, worth 70 yuan. ㊁ At 10:30 pm on January 13th, in room 332 of the Zhonghua Hotel, he defrauded Zhang Caiying and Yang Zuifang, female employees of the Yakai Escort Agency at No. 2, Lane 17, White Pike Road, of two coats, worth 32 yuan. ㊂ On January 8th, in room 311 of the New World Hotel, he defrauded Jiang Mulan, a female employee of the Sanle Escort Agency at No. 18, Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, of a gold ring and a coat, worth 33 yuan. ㊃ On January 20th, in room 230 of the Yangtze Hotel, he defrauded Li Xiuying, a female employee of the Taohuagong Escort Agency at No. 60 Ningbo Road, of a diamond ring and a bracelet, worth 158 yuan. ㊄ On January 18th, in room 205 of the Great Shanghai Hotel, he defrauded Zhang Huizhen of the Saluomen Massage Parlor at No. 12 Yuqiaqing Road of 9 yuan, Chen Fengying of a wristwatch, and Wang Aiying of a ring, totaling 39 yuan. On January 30th, in room 303 of the Great Shanghai Hotel, he defrauded Chen Aidi, a woman living at No. 27 Rongshengli, of a red and green gemstone ring each, and a bracelet, totaling 74 yuan, etc. Yesterday, Judge Pan Zhenyang of the First Special Court opened the Fifth Criminal Court for interrogation. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police station prosecuted all the above cases based on the crime of fraud and obtaining property under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. He also stated that some of the stolen goods in the above cases had been recovered, and it was learned that the defendant had committed many similar cases, but there was not enough time to investigate, so he requested a postponement. The female employees of the escort agencies who had been victimized provided evidence of the deception. When questioned, Lu Genlin also admitted to everything. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Dai announced that the hearing would be adjourned for further questioning. During the court hearing, there were dozens of escort agency employees who had been similarly deceived but had not reported to the police. They came to the court to listen and reported to the detectives the details of the deception they had experienced and what they had lost when they recognized Lu as the perpetrator. Therefore, there will definitely be more cases added next time.

(It was found that the counterfeit currency was well-printed, with both the front and back sides very clear, indistinguishable from the real ones, only the paper was thinner.) Detective Feng verified the information and then, at around 10:00 pm the night before, together with Chinese detective inspectors Pang Yutang, Sun Wenxi, Xu Deyang, Zhang KuiDong, and Western detective inspectors, secretly waited at Yuanyuan.

Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station stated the above situation, arguing that the den set up by the defendants was quite large in scale and requesting permission to detain them for detailed investigation. He then presented the seized items to the court. Judge Chuan Lin briefly questioned each defendant and ordered them to be detained for a period of fourteen days for investigation and further questioning. During the court hearing, there were dozens of escort agency employees who had been similarly deceived but had not reported to the police, who came to the court to listen. Some of them recognized that they had indeed been deceived by Lu and reported the details of the deception they had experienced and what they had lost to the detectives.

### Conflict Between Old and New Workers After the Yihua Guangsheng Ship Departed

Many People Injured; Ship Has Returned to Shanghai

The Yihua Company's Guangsheng ship, which runs the north-south ocean line to Hangzhou or Singapore, does not have a fixed schedule. Chen Liangshan, the comprador of the ship, resigned, and the company hired Yue Pin Chen from Hong Kong to replace him. There were disputes due to the dismissal of workers, which were mediated and resolved by the Seamen's Union. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 pm on the 4th, when the ship arrived near Daji Ocean from Shanghai, a conflict suddenly broke out between the old and new workers, injuring many people. The shipowner had no choice but to turn the ship back to Shanghai. It arrived outside Wusongkou at noon on the 5th and stopped. It was reported to the Water Patrol Team, who used two small ships at 1:00 pm to separately transport the old and new workers to the New Customs Wharf. Ambulances were called to send the injured workers to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is now learned that the old workers, in addition to asking the local court to verify the injuries and file a public prosecution, have also petitioned Yang, the special representative of the Chinese Seamen's Union, arguing that this incident was instigated by the new comprador, so Yihua Foreign Firm should bear full responsibility. They have made the following demands to the company: ㊀ Yihua Company must hand over the murderer and the business director within a time limit for strict punishment according to law. ㊁ The company should bear the medical expenses of the injured workers until they are fully recovered, as well as the livelihood of their families. ㊂ The company should maintain the livelihood of the remaining workers. ㊃ The company should compensate for the losses of all workers. ㊄ If Yihua's Jianghai ships need to change business directors and hire new workers in the future, they must first notify the Seamen's Union for dispatch and management, and the contract labor system should not be used, with the comprador hiring privately.

Xu Wanfu (also known as Da Kuaitou Wang Si), 29 years old, from Jiancheng, residing at No. 90 Huixiang Lane, a blacksmith, and Wei Xingwen, 42 years old, from Funing, were also taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to Xu Wanfu's confession, the accomplice Li Yong'an used to be a patrolman in the French Concession. After being dismissed, he often roamed in the wasteland around the Xieqiao area on the border between the Chinese and French concessions.

They Met and Became Acquainted

So, at 7:00 pm on July 7th of last year, Li Yong'an initiated the idea and invited Zheng Baoxiang, etc., to rob the patrolman's handgun. Zheng Baoxiang stepped forward to hold the police officer, and I used the handgun to monitor the police officer. At that time, the police officer also drew his gun. At the same time, Li Yong'an ordered me to fire four shots, three shots hitting the police officer, and one shot accidentally injuring the left hand of the accomplice Zheng Baoxiang. At that time, the police officer's gun had been abandoned on the road, so Li Yong'an picked it up and inserted it into his own waistband. At the same time, the handgun I was holding was also returned to Li Yong'an. The next day, I met Li Yong'an in the wasteland. He took out twenty cents in silver and gave it to Zheng Baoxiang to buy medicine to apply to the gunshot wound. He also instructed him not to go to the hospital.

They Separated From Then On

I did not see him for two months. It was in September that I met Li Yong'an again. I asked him for the police officer's gun. He gave it to me. Less than a week later, he sent a small cobbler to take it to rob a certain place in the French Concession. Later, the handgun was lost. Twenty days ago, Gao Fusheng (also known as Xiao Sanzi) and an accomplice surnamed Yuan robbed a nunnery behind Jiadeli and obtained more than ten yuan and a coat. Xiao Sanzi divided one yuan to me. The day before yesterday (February 2nd), they robbed Qianjia'an unsuccessfully. He also confessed that the accomplice Zheng Baoxiang was hiding on a houseboat on Yuque Road, Dapu Road. The original officers then took the arrested bandit Xu Wanfu to the above location and identified Zheng Baoxiang (also known as Zheng San), 42 years old, from Funing, and Zhang Yongxiang, 50 years old, from Yancheng, who were also taken to the bureau for interrogation. Zheng Baoxiang's confession was the same as Xu Wanfu's. Gao Fusheng (also known as Xiao Sanzi)

Confessed to Organizing

the robbery of the Song Laohu family in Caohejing on January 12th, and the Zhao Yiqing family at No. 5 Jinjiazai on January 31st, etc. It was also learned that the handgun used by bandit Xu Wanfu to shoot and kill patrolman Jiang Huaian was No. 13411. It has now been cracked by the French Police Station in the robbery of the French-owned tram company. The gangster Shen Chaoyu, Liang Honggen, Qiu Changfu, etc., accomplices of Li Yong'an, had a handgun seized, which was confirmed to be the gun that killed the patrolman. The Fifth Detective Detachment has dispatched officers to the French Police Station to retrieve the gun for the case. Yao, the director of the branch, briefly interrogated them. In addition to strictly apprehending the fugitive chief bandit Li Yong'an and bringing him to justice, the bandits Gao Fusheng, Xu Wanfu, Zheng Baoxiang, Wei Xingwen, and Zhang Yongxiang were sent to the headquarters for interrogation, along with two handguns and a flashlight.

### Huzhou Association Held a Meeting Last Night

Families of Victims of Yongxin Ship Disaster Request; Decided to Send Personnel to Handle

After the Yongxin steamer of Yongshun Steamship Company caused a disaster near Pingwang and sank, causing a major tragedy on the inland waterway, the Huzhou Association in this city, upon hearing the news, specially dispatched commissioners Shen Yanxiang and Jiang Dingyu to rush to the scene of the accident to conduct an on-site investigation and assist in handling the aftermath and relief matters, as reported in previous newspapers. On the 5th, the association received a joint letter from the families of the victims of the Yongxin ship, requesting justice and assistance, and held a meeting last night, deciding on several important matters. The details are summarized below:

Letter from Families of Victims

Dear Sirs, This time, the Yongxin steamer had an accident, and most of the victims were from Huzhou. Because our association is the hub for fellow villagers in Shanghai, you must have heard the details. Because of the close relationship between family or relatives, we rushed to the scene of the accident night and day. Witnessing the situation, we were extremely grieved. In addition to handling matters on-site, we are saddened that Yongshun Company should bear absolute responsibility for this long-standing event. Who has no parents, who has no children and relatives? If we do not pursue this according to law, how can we appease the deceased? For our fellow villagers traveling between the countryside and Shanghai, how can we guarantee their lives? Considering that we are weak and unable to plan thoroughly, we dare to act presumptuously and have printed and distributed "A Statement to All Sectors Regarding the Yongxin Steamer Disaster" at the scene. Now, we are specially attaching it by express mail, respectfully requesting all members of your association to inspect it, and we implore you to vigorously preside over justice and comfort the public's expectations. It would be a great kindness. Respectfully, the Executive Committee of the Huzhou Association, Wu Lusheng, Zhao Tongbao, Zhuang Songchi, Liu Sishin, Ji Aoxiang, Jin Weixian, He Zairong, Wang Zemin, Wang Zhaoji, Ma Zuyi, Shao Zihou, Ji Fanzhi, Zeng Laojiu, Zhou Dingxun, etc., the families of the victims of the Yongxin steamer (all signed), 26.25. Yesterday, twelve bodies were recovered. As of the time of sending the letter today, a total of twenty bodies have been recovered. A total of thirty-two bodies have been recovered.

Huzhou Association Holds Meeting

After receiving the letter, the Huzhou Association immediately convened a meeting of the executive committee members at 6:00 pm last night. The attendees included Wang Yiting, Yan Junxuan, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Tianxin, Shen Jiesheng, Shen Yanxiang, Mao Yun, etc. Chairman Shen Tianxin first reported on the details of the Yongxin ship accident, followed by Shen Yanxiang reporting on the on-site investigation and the tragic situation after the accident. The committee members believed that the bodies of the victims had not been fully recovered after several days, and it was not appropriate to delay any longer. They immediately decided to appoint Standing Committee Member Shen Yanxiang and Association Member Jiang Dingyu to go to Pingwang again today to work with the local government to properly handle the matter. At the same time, they published advertisements soliciting reports from victims who had escaped danger, and those who witnessed the accident, and instructed the lawyers of the Legal Group of the Association's Fellow Villagers' Undertaking Guidance Office to assist the families of the victims in seeking legal remedies.

### Defrauding by Altering Waste House Tickets and Occupying More Than 10,000 Gold

Da Tong Sues Hu Yousheng - There is a Dispute Over the Amount

Hu Yousheng, 38 years old, from Pudong, was employed as a rent collector at Da Tong Real Estate Company at 573 Sichuan Road. Recently, Hu altered discarded house tickets and collected rent from tenants without handing over the collected rent to the company. After an investigation by the company authorities, it was discovered that Hu had embezzled more than 12,000 gold using this method. They reported to the General Inspectorate, ordering Chinese Detective Zhang Mingde and Detective Wu Yaozu to arrest Hu at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday and bring him back to the police station. Under interrogation, Hu only admitted to embezzling several thousand gold and denied embezzling more than 12,000. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. The police station lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, explained the situation, stating that the accounts still needed to be thoroughly investigated to determine the actual amount embezzled by the defendant. Therefore, he requested a temporary detention pending further investigation before filing a lawsuit. After Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division questioned him, he approved a postponement for further interrogation.

### Overview of the Prevalence of Infectious Diseases in the City Last Year

According to a report from the Municipal Council's Health Department, typhoid and paratyphoid fever became epidemic in the summer and autumn of last year, affecting more than 700 people (including Chinese and foreigners), of which approximately 600 died. Smallpox and malaria also spread rapidly. In the week before September 26th last year, there were as many as 72 cases of malaria, which was shocking. Malaria mosquito larvae were found in rice paddies and ponds in the suburbs of the city. Mosquitoes also grew in the bottom floors of large buildings and in the pits of soil around electric and telephone poles. In order to prevent their breeding, the Health Department poured mosquito oil into these depressions and sewage ponds or raised small fish that habitually eat mosquito larvae, and sprayed mosquito repellent in residents' homes. Three staff members from the department, accompanied by eight workers, were dedicated to this task. The Public Works Department also dispatched workers to level the low-lying areas in various locations. As of the end of last year, more than 78 acres of low-lying land had been leveled in the east and west districts of the Public Concession. This work was very effective in eradicating malaria. More than 300,000 people were vaccinated throughout the year, and more than 90,000 people were injected with cholera vaccine. Cholera was not discovered, so the number of people injected with cholera vaccine decreased compared to the previous year. However, the Municipal Council's Health Department continued to spare no effort in reducing flies. Fly covers and fly traps prepared by food stores and fruit stalls were very effective. More than 5,000 licensed shops have been inspected monthly by the Health Department to crack down on illegal business practices or offensive behavior. No cases of plague have occurred, but preventive work is also continuing unabated. In order to inform the public about protecting their health, the Health Department used radio to broadcast health knowledge and compiled small pamphlets in Chinese, English, Japanese, and Russian, which were distributed from time to time. In addition, advertising slides were shown in cinemas to advise the public to pay attention to their health.

### Southern District Tobacco Exchange Industry Requests Increase in Copper Auxiliary Coins

The Shanghai South Office of the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association of this city has been entrusted by the Central Bank to exchange one-cent new copper auxiliary coins. The office can only receive three boxes per day, which is actually not enough for distribution, especially as the Lunar New Year approaches and the need is even greater. After convening a committee meeting, it was decided that in addition to sending Chairman Chen Kunxian to the Central Bank to request an increase in the issuance of one-cent new steel auxiliary coins to meet the needs, a letter was specially sent to the association yesterday requesting relief. The letter stated, "To whom it may concern, we have repeatedly received requests from members for relief due to the lack of one-cent new copper auxiliary coins. The previous dispatch of three boxes, totaling 600 yuan, was not enough for distribution, and the need is even greater due to the approaching Lunar New Year. At the committee meeting convened on the 5th, it was unanimously decided to ask Chairman Chen to quickly request the Central Bank to increase the amount of one-cent new steel auxiliary coins to provide relief and facilitate the exchange of coins for citizens. Please do not stop on Sundays, otherwise, please increase the allocation on Saturdays. This has been unanimously passed and is hereby submitted. This matter concerns the happiness of the industry, and we sincerely request your assistance and handling."

### Seafood Association Dissolves

Joining the Seafood and Grocery Industry Association

The Shanghai Seafood Industry Association of this city has dissolved from today due to the fact that most of its members have closed down due to the impact of the sluggish market, resulting in a lack of the legal number of members, and the nature of the members' business is similar to that of the members of the Shanghai Seafood and Grocery Industry Association. All members have decided to dissolve the association from today, and its members will join the Seafood and Grocery Industry Association as members. The case has been reported to the Municipal Party Department's Social Affairs Bureau for record.

### Lu Chengshu Yun Sues for Embezzlement of Jewelry and Summoning Witnesses

Mediation Did Not Mention the Jewelry Box

Lu Guanzeng, the owner of Yuanli Yuchang Pawnshop in this city and a native of Suzhou, and Yu, the former manager of the pawnshop, were recently sued by Lu's wife, Cheng Shuyun, for embezzlement of jewelry. The case has been heard once by the First Special Court, as detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court continued to hear the case in the Second Criminal Court. The police station lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated that the summonses for the witnesses ordered to be summoned to court today, Qin Runqing, Jin Yushu, Ge Zufeng, Lu Ding-san, and Ge Chengshi, had all been served. However, Ge Chengshi could not attend court due to illness. The court then questioned the witnesses separately. First, Qin Runqing testified that due to the discord between Lu Chengshee and Lu Guanzeng, he mediated once in Suzhou in July or August of the 24th year. The purpose of the mediation was to restore the relationship between the two parties and allow them to live together again. At that time, the conditions proposed by the plaintiff were separation, with the children being raised in Shanghai and the real estate being managed by the plaintiff. Because Lu could not agree to some parts, it was not successful. The court asked if the matter of jewelry was mentioned at that time, and the answer was no. He was also asked if the plaintiff had a safe deposit box in Fu Yuan Qianzhuang, and he answered that there was indeed a box with the account name "San Ji," etc. Lu Chengshi denied that the "San Ji" safe deposit box was rented by her. Jin Yushu then testified that he participated in a mediation at Ge Zufeng's house in March or April of the 24th year. At that time, the plaintiff was afraid of financial losses, so she wanted Lu to transfer the management of the Shanghai real estate to her. As a result of the mediation, the two sons were taken back by Lu, and Lu handed over the real estate title deeds to the plaintiff. The plaintiff bought an iron box, put the title deeds in it, and stored the box in the Yuanli Chang storage vault. The key to the box was held by the plaintiff. Later, due to disagreements, they broke up again. The matter of jewelry was not mentioned at that time. Ge Zufeng then testified that the mediation process was the same as Jin's. Lu Ding-san testified that he had participated in many mediations, but none were successful. The court then questioned Yu, asking if the plaintiff had come to pick up the jewelry at 12:00 noon on December 22nd last year and was refused. Yu replied that this was not the case and that the plaintiff had not come on that day at all. The court then questioned Lu Chengshi and Lu Guanzeng, and ordered the case to be heard again at a later date.

### Robbery on Connaught Road

At around 6:00 PM yesterday, four robbers broke into a certain residence at No. 161, Lane 577, Connaught Road. Three of the robbers were armed with handguns. After entering the house, they first put all the men and women in the house under surveillance, then forced them to hand over the keys to the boxes, broke into the inner room to search and ransack, taking as long as an hour before fleeing out the door with a whistle. The owner of the house checked the losses and found that the total value of the stolen property was about 300 taels plus more than ten yuan. They filed a detailed list of losses with the police station in charge, requesting pursuit and arrest.

### Robbers Found at Anle Hotel Sentenced and Released Separately

Three Unrelated Parties Released First, Zhao Qi and Five Others Sentenced

The Hongkou Police Station's Chinese Detective Yue Huang Fusen, Jin Haibo, and Detectives Hu Guangrong and Chen Dabao, at 4:20 PM on the 29th of last month, along with Western detectives, arrested a large number of bandits in Room 54 of Anle Hotel on North Zhejiang Road and No. 228 Aierjin Road, who were conspiring to rob residents of their property. Zhao Qi from Tongzhou, Zhang Afu from Liuhe, suspected criminals Zhang Ma Shi, Xue Xiaomei, and other men and women, nine in total, were arrested. Two handguns and thirty-three bullets were confiscated. In the evening, the detectives waited in the hotel room and a man named Zhang Caiqi from Pudong came to find a friend. He looked suspicious, and when questioned, Zhang panicked and fled. The guard fired a shot, injuring his leg, and he was sent to the police hospital for treatment. Zhao Qi and his group were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court for further trial. The Municipal Council lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that during the postponement, the police station detectives searched Zhao Qi's room in front of the China Hotel at No. 241 Boundary Road and found seven bullets. It was found that on the day of the arrest, the group planned to rob a certain family on Chengdu Road. The mastermind, a fugitive named Wang Yuzhi, had the idea, but was arrested by the police station before they could achieve their goal. Among the defendants, Xu Yaping, Wu Kun, and Zhang Caiqi, who was injured in the hospital, were found to be unrelated and should be released first. Judge Xiao Xie-fen questioned each defendant and clarified the facts. Zhao Qi was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment. Zhang Afu, Wang Jinsheng, Wang Ziqing, and Wu Wangqing were each sentenced to forty days of detention. The guns and bullets were confiscated. Zhang Ma Shi and Xue Xiaomei were released.

### Tan's Search for Her Husband, Ma Chang Flees and Disappears

Falling in Love with a Female Student, the Wife is in Distress - Crying to the Legal Community, Listeners Lament

Lawyer Ma Chang, 32 years old, from Yixing, resides at No. 612 Lafayette Road. Twelve years ago, he married Tan, a woman from the same hometown. After their marriage, the couple had a harmonious relationship and had one son and one daughter. The son, named Jie Mei, eight years old, unfortunately died on September 21st of last year. The daughter, named Yiqing, is currently studying at a primary school in her hometown. Seven years ago, Ma Chang came to Shanghai to practice law. As his legal practice flourished, he became financially well-off and began a relationship with a female student from the Law School, surnamed Lin, renting a house to live with her, neglecting his wife Tan and children. Tan came to Shanghai to look for Ma Chang and ask for alimony. However, Ma avoided meeting her. After Tan inquired in various ways, she finally learned of his sweet spot at No. 5 Hehe Lane, Xiafei Road, in the French Concession. She went to the address, and lawyer Wu Kaisheng mediated. As a result, Ma Chang subsidized Tan 26 yuan per month for living expenses, and she returned to her hometown. Starting in January of last year, Ma stopped paying Tan's living expenses, causing her to be unable to make a living. She had no choice but to come to Shanghai on the 20th of last month to look for him. Unexpectedly, Ma avoided seeing her. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Tan learned that Ma Chang was going to the District Court to appear in court to represent a certain case, so she waited at the entrance of the court. When Ma arrived at the entrance of the court by car, Tan went forward to grab him, but was dispersed by an unknown person. Tan let go, and Ma took the opportunity to escape. Tan cried incessantly, pleading with the guards to search the court for him, but Ma Chang was not found. She then went to the lawyers' lounge in the court to cry to the lawyers about the above situation. Those who heard it lamented.

### Merchants' Inland River Bureau Employees' Meeting Yesterday

Declaration Issued to Request Support From All Circles

Xin Sheng She reports that the entire staff of the Merchants' Inland River Steamship Bureau held its second representative meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Que Zhiqing presided over the meeting, and the resolutions are listed below: ㊀ Zhuang Tai-bei, the employee representative from the Xi Li Chang Li two lines, sent a letter to participate and unanimously agreed. ㊁ A five-day notice will be reissued, welcoming employees from various shallow waterways to participate. ㊂ A declaration will be issued and assistance from all circles will be requested. ㊃ Cao Zhezhiing, an employee of the bureau, will be hired as the group's document manager. ㊄ All external affairs of the group will be printed with a wooden seal, with the words (Merchants' Inland River Steamship Bureau Shenhu Ling and other waterway employee representative group), kept by Shen Jingyi. ㊅ Shen Jingyi, Chen Meixin, and Fang Huashan were elected as permanent representatives to handle affairs. The meeting was adjourned at around 6:00 PM after being unanimously approved by the representatives. The original text of the declaration is recorded below: According to reports, the state-owned Merchants' Bureau will suspend the Inland River Bureau due to poor business and huge losses, intending to give private shipping companies the opportunity to develop. The Inland River Bureau has suffered losses over the years due to huge expenses, unsound internal organization, and unexpected expenses such as opening new routes, resulting in intangible losses. The Bureau decided to reorganize and stopped self-management at the end of May last year, renting out all routes. The entire line generates a monthly rental income of more than 3,700 yuan. The General Bureau established a management office with monthly expenses of more than 1,000 yuan, resulting in a monthly net surplus of 2,500 to 600 yuan, which can yield a surplus of about 30,000 yuan per year. Taking the Huling line as an example, it was leased to Li Xing Bureau He Zhiying. From September 1st to 11th last year, the Bureau managed the line on their behalf due to the incomplete handover of the accounting department. After offsetting income and expenditure for the ten days, there was a net surplus of more than 300 yuan. It is unknown what losses are referred to. As for giving private shipping companies the opportunity to develop, the sub-bureaus and private bureaus were not notified in advance, making it impossible for those interested in shipping to participate. Once the routes are suspended, the livelihoods of the employees are cut off in an instant. They have no choice but to organize an employee representative group to request the party and government organs to forward the request to the Ministry of Communications for the resumption of routes. The Merchants' Bureau then made the aforementioned statement, and the Ministry of Communications ordered the suspension and closure of the routes at the end of the 25th year. Why did they sign a draft contract with Zhang Yi on January 1st of the 26th year and accept Zhang's deposit of 10,000 yuan on the 5th? Zhang leased the bureau, and the annual rental fee was 18,000 yuan, with all expenses borne by Zhang. The contract budget was set for five years. The total revenue during these five years is 90,000 yuan. Whether the entire property of the Inland River Bureau can meet this amount after it is auctioned off once the routes are suspended is also a question. (It is heard that the state-owned Merchants' Bureau's predetermined plan is more than 60,000 yuan, and the rental income is higher. The property is still owned by the Merchants' Bureau. Auctioning the revenue is not as good as leasing, which the Merchants' Bureau will never be able to do. It is a pity to end the long-standing Inland River Bureau, and thousands of innocent employees will suddenly lose their jobs. Therefore, we respectfully inform all circles in the country to uphold justice and call for assistance. This is a special declaration.

### Shanghai Chinese Football Team to Depart for Hong Kong the Day After Tomorrow for the Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Interport Match

The Lineup and Schedule for the Shanghai Team Have Been Determined

The Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Interport Football Championship, sponsored by the National Sports Advancement Association, was suspended midway and only proposed for resumption last winter. After both sides agreed, the Shanghai Chinese Football Association immediately began organizing the Chinese team to travel south to Hong Kong to compete. The selection of players was also carried out twice. However, Chen Zhenhe recently entered the aviation school, and Sun Jinshun's foot ailment relapsed, so they withdrew one after another. In addition, Zhuang Youren serves as the director of the remittance department of the China South Bank in this city, and his leave was not approved during the closing period. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether he will be able to go. The Chinese team feels a sigh of difficulty in finding talent after this setback. Now that they are scheduled to depart south the day after tomorrow (9th), in addition to various trivial matters that need to be discussed, the issue of supplementing the lineup may also be considered. Therefore, a meeting is scheduled to be held at the Lao Jinlong Hotel at 12:30 noon tomorrow (Monday) to prepare. The team will depart at 6:30 PM on the 9th, led by Jiang Xiangqing, the representative of the Advancement Association, on the Asian Empress wheel. The ship is docked in Pudong and must cross the river at the New Customs Wharf. In terms of the lineup, Wang Kehou has now been added to the team. If Zhuang Youren's leave is approved, no further supplements will be allowed. The previous rumor that Guan Xun'an would be invited to join after arriving in Hong Kong has been proven to be untrue. The entire team will play three matches in Hong Kong. The schedule and list are as follows:

Match Schedule

February 14th: Shanghai Chinese vs. Hong Kong Chinese United

February 17th: Shanghai Chinese vs. Hong Kong Military United

February 21st: Shanghai Chinese vs. Guangdong Chinese United

### Final Trial Match for Interport Football

Chinese Team Suffers a Miserable Defeat of 1-5

Yesterday, the Chinese and Western interport teams held their final practice match in Shenyuan. Selection committees from both sides were present to observe, and the audience was not crowded, only half-full. The situation was very loose. The lineups for both sides after the kickoff were:

The Chinese team attacked first and was immediately intercepted. At five minutes, Foen shot from a distance, and the ball flew into the right corner of the net, giving the Interport team a 1-0 lead. At thirty-five minutes, Dai Linjing received a pass from Gu Zhi and hooked the ball while lying on the ground. Youliang stepped in and sent it to the center, and Yichen's header hit the crossbar and bounced out. Dai then rushed up and hooked the ball with his right foot, leaking it under Bao Saizhong's armpit, making it a 1-1 tie. Mashaner sent the ball to the front of the Chinese goal from a distance, and it was besieged again. Bolingai broke through and entered the net, making it 2-1. Before long, the first half ended. The audience was dissatisfied and loudly attacked Zhou Qinghui, threatening him, causing Zhou to quietly leave. When the second half began and the whistle blew, Zhou was not seen for a long time. After waiting for about three minutes, Feng Yunyou replaced him. The lineups of both sides were also greatly changed.

The Chinese team became even more rigid after this change. Only three minutes after the kickoff, Robert Stoff scored a goal, making it 3-1. Ten minutes later, the Chinese team replaced Liu Shizhan with Luo Douwen. Mashaner also exited for the Interport team, replaced by Pan Jinsheng. The attack became even more intense, and Feng had already dived to catch it near the post, but he was bumped by Bolingai, and the ball fell to the ground, allowing it to be hooked into the net, making it 4-1. Ten minutes before the end, Jem scored another goal, making it 5-1. The Chinese team suffered a miserable defeat.

Educational News

### City's Education Sector Declares Support for the National Unification and Salvation Movement

The City Education Association and more than 20 educational and cultural groups issued the following declaration yesterday: (1) The establishment of a unified country is the most important event in modern history. The construction of a national state, the completion of the national economy, the rise of national consciousness, and national literature are all prominent aspects of its content. The transition from medieval feudalism to modern history is an inevitable process. Otherwise, it is destruction. (2) Although China was unified on the surface in the past, the political situation was divided. Not to mention the warlords since the Republic of China, the power of the governors and governors in the Qing Dynasty was not much different from that of feudal lords. As for the economy, each region formed its own unit, traffic was blocked, and currencies were different. If we want to become a modern country, we must break this state of division and create political and economic unity. (3) According to Chinese and foreign history, the formation of a unified country has never been without the use of force. However, today, China is being invaded by strong enemies, and the people's livelihood is difficult. Using force internally will give the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of the situation, and the country's vitality will be greatly damaged. Therefore, force should be used only when it is absolutely necessary. We must preserve and enrich this force to deal with the enemy and the traitors they employ. (4) Then what methods do we use to eliminate division and complete unification? It is peaceful means. Only in this way can the national strength be further enriched. After the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi last year, our diplomacy was able to be strong and resist the enemy's attacks. This is the reason. (5) One of the means of peaceful unification is economic construction, because once traffic is convenient and economic relations can be integrated, the mutual dependence between each other will make it impossible for the remaining feudal warlords to implement division even if they want to. The failure of the Communists in Jiangxi was due to military reasons on the one hand, and to the severe blow of economic blockade on the other hand. (6) However, the work of economic construction cannot be completed immediately. Therefore, in order to complete national unification at this time, we need another peaceful means, which is to establish public opinion for national unification and create a movement to promote unification, so that those who undermine unification will feel that they have become the public enemy of the people. Therefore, the remarks of unified national salvation are worthy of our deep attention. (7) We know that the education sector should be "the vanguard of the people." For the future of the country and the future of the nation, we naturally cannot ignore this declaration. We should also promote it to promote its realization. This is our hope. The Shanghai Municipal Education Association and the Education Associations of various districts, the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of various universities, the United Association of Secondary Schools, the United Association of Faculty and Staff of Secondary Schools, the Secondary School Advancement Association, the Elementary School Education Advancement Association, the United Association of Faculty and Staff of Elementary Schools, the Compulsory Education Research Association, the Shanghai Municipal Vocational Guidance Institute, the Secondary School Moral Education Research Association, the China Art Education Society, the Shanghai Social Education Society, the Shanghai Professors and Writers Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Educational Film Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Scientific Movement Association, the China Educational Construction Society, and the Shanghai Branch of the China Social Science Society jointly declare, February 6, 26th year [1937].

### Social Bureau and Other Groups Host Melvin

Deep Admiration Expressed for People's Livelihood Education

Mr. A. Gordon Melvin, an American progressive educator and professor at New York University, and his wife, came to China to observe education. Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, the Shanghai Social Bureau, the Chinese People's Livelihood Education Society, the 22nd Movement Promotion Association, the Huxi People's Livelihood Education Experimental Zone, the Shanghai Circuit Education Zone, the Caojiadu Nian'er Society, and other groups hosted a banquet for Mr. Melvin at the Yipinxiang Restaurant.  In attendance were Mr. and Mrs. Melvin, Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Qingshi, Ji Shuangqiu, Tang Maohuai, and over twenty other people. During the banquet, Pan Gongzhan presided, and Jiang Jianbai introduced Mr. Melvin's life and contributions to education, followed by an invitation for Mr. Melvin to speak. Mr. Melvin briefly stated that he had previously visited China ten years ago to observe education and deeply regretted that Chinese education at the time was striving to imitate educational practices that Americans themselves were discarding. He believed that the new education of a country must be specific to its unique circumstances, and therefore, the new education of each country must be different. China's new education must be suitable for China's social conditions and the people's lives. He said that Chinese educators ten years ago were unaware of this, but that is no longer the case. Educational reform is progressing daily. Generally speaking, Chinese education is no longer as focused on textbooks as it once was, but is now based on the practical needs of people's livelihoods. This spirit is also more advanced than before. The ideals promoted by the Nian'er Movement and the People's Livelihood Education Society are manifestations of this spirit. Mr. Melvin stated that what he had seen today in the People's Livelihood Education Experimental Zone, including the various practical facilities and the economic group system advocated by the zone, where economic activities are the warp and various forms of education are the weft, is indeed an educational philosophy formed in and originating from China itself, and is most suitable for the needs of Chinese education today. Finally, Mr. Melvin expressed his admiration for the progress in various aspects of Chinese politics and society, expressing his deep wish that China could catch up with Japan within a few short years, and hoping that the Chinese government, the Chinese People's Livelihood Education Society, and the 22nd Movement Promotion Association would devote more efforts to people's livelihood education. After Mr. Melvin's speech, Ji Shuangqiu introduced the Shanghai Social Bureau's efforts to promote people's livelihood education in Shanghai and elaborated on Mr. Melvin's propositions. Mr. Melvin then further discussed the meaning of people's livelihood education, believing that it is definitely different from life education and that this term originated in China and does not have a suitable translation in English, suggesting that the term "Min-sen" should be used directly. Finally, Pan Gongzhan gave a thank you speech to Mr. Melvin, and the guests and hosts dispersed in high spirits. It is reported that Mr. Melvin departed for Nanchang today to observe education and may return to Shanghai after February to give public lectures.

Shen Bao Children's Special Issue

### School Begins!

— Junming

The second semester of the 25th year has already begun. Children! We should reflect on the past and hope for the future. At the beginning of school, probably every child is like this!

When reflecting on the past, we should ask ourselves: "How was my performance in academics last semester? How was my conduct? How was my physical health?..." Academics: Did you pass subjects like arithmetic and general knowledge? If you failed, what will you do this semester? Was the failure due to not paying attention on weekdays? I think all of you children! Commit this common problem. Children like to play, which is natural, but we should not only like to play and neglect our schoolwork, which is most important. If you don't pay attention on weekdays, how can you pass the exam? If you cheat and get lucky and pass, how dangerous is that? Once you are discovered by the teacher, where is your integrity? The future is also frightening! So, I ask you children! To remember these words: "Only play when playing, only study when studying, do not have a侥倖 mind, and do not lack a mindset of improvement."

Conduct: Have you done anything immoral to relatives or classmates? Have you remembered the teacher's instructions? If you found someone else's belongings, did you hand them over to the teacher or return them to the owner? Have you ever scolded or fought with your classmates? I think you all must say, "Our conduct is very good!" However, after getting your report card, if you lied and deceived your illiterate parents, is that still considered good conduct? So, I ask you children! Not to lie in the future, it has a great relationship with your future, quickly become an honest good child.

Physical health: Do you like to eat candy on weekdays? Do your teeth often hurt? Does your stomach also hurt? I think: you must like to eat candy, and if you eat too much candy, you will definitely have toothaches and stomachaches, leading to illness. If you get sick, you have to ask a doctor to treat you, and then you have to take medicine. However, all of you children, you definitely don't like to take medicine, because medicine is bitter. That's right, if you get sick, your body suffers a major loss, and your schoolwork also suffers a great blow. So, I ask you children, to eat less candy and exercise more on weekdays, your body will naturally be healthy, and money can also be saved. Why not do it?

All of you children! Do you have the above reflections? The first semester of the 25th year is over, but the second semester has begun again. So, I hope you quickly make a plan to prepare for this semester, so that you will have the possibility of graduating or advancing in the future. Otherwise, won't you be working hard for a year in vain? Your parents are hoping for you! ... Strive! Strive!

### Children's Issues in Nursery Rhymes

— Baling

"Little brother, little sister, don't cry, the eldest sister is picking reed millet in the field, the younger sister is picking orchids and chrysanthemums in the garden, Aunt is cooking wheat porridge in the kitchen, Grandpa is drying the spring harvest on the threshing floor, Grandma is cleaning pickled meat on the water bridge, Grandpa is hoeing radishes at home, elder brother is opening bamboo shoots behind the house, elder brother is building a thatched house in front of the door, Uncle is selling new grain in town, Uncle is propping up the axles at home, the whole family is busy, little brother, don't nag too much!"

This is a nursery rhyme about stopping children from crying, which is very popular in the agricultural areas of Jiangnan. In this short nursery rhyme, we can see that the general parents in China have taken completely the wrong path in their methods of training children, using only deceptive means to educate and train children. How can this achieve good results? Maybe it will even affect the entire child's thinking. As in the nursery rhyme above, its purpose is entirely to prevent children from crying. However, they do not study the reasons why children cry at all, but rely solely on deceptive and lying methods, hoping to achieve results temporarily. This is a huge mistake that we should point out and correct.

Everyone admits that children's lying is a very bad habit, and adults should find ways to correct it. However, parents and those responsible for educating children often unintentionally or intentionally use incorrect words to perfunctorily answer and deceive children. Is this a right thing to do?

I sincerely hope that from now on, modern parents will be able to deeply understand the importance of the responsibility of educating children, and wake up to the fact that to correct children's bad habits, we must first lead by example. We want to cultivate honest children, and we must first start by not lying ourselves.

### The Origin of Coal

— Yang Zhigang

Winter! Many children's homes are using stoves again! To light a stove, you need coal! Do you think coal is useful?

In addition to stoves, coal can also be used as fuel for various engines, which can power various machines—trains, steamers, and machines in factories all need it. Coal is really the ancestor of modern science!

If you take a look at a piece of coal, you can see many patterns that look like tree trunks or leaves. This leads to the conclusion that coal is transformed from plants.

In ancient times, many forests were buried deep underground after earthquakes or landslides. They were pressed by the Earth's crust above and heated by the Earth's core below. After tens of millions of years, they gradually turned into coal! Coal is classified into peat, lignite, bituminous coal, and anthracite depending on how long it has been buried underground. Among them, anthracite is the best and the most expensive.

The method of mining coal is to first dig a deep hole of hundreds or thousands of feet in the coal-producing area, and then go inside to excavate. After it is dug out, it is transported outside by manual labor or machinery. The air in this kind of hole is very dirty, and the miners inside are very hard-working. In addition, there is also a kind of "marsh gas," which is very flammable, so it is very dangerous. Children, the things we use every day very easily are actually very difficult to obtain!

China has a lot of coal mines, and there is a lot of coal buried underground. According to the calculations of international geographers, the coal buried underground in China can supply the world for more than 2,000 years! Children! It can supply the world for more than 2,000 years, do you think that's a lot? However, unfortunately, we are still afraid of being able to fully exploit it, and we still have to import from foreign countries every year, burying rich coal mines underground without exploiting them. Do you think it's a pity?

China produces coal in many places; Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Suiyuan provinces have the highest output. Other provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou also have a lot. Unfortunately, most of the coal mines, such as Kailuan and Boshan, are controlled by foreigners. Also, the Fushun coal mine in Liaoning Province has already been taken away by others, allowing them to exploit it as much as they want. Do you think it's annoying?

### New Year's Money and Toys

— Pan Wenan

An Important Issue in Children's Education

According to the traditional custom of the Lunar New Year, children often bow to elders, which is commonly known as paying New Year's greetings, and elders often give money as gifts, which is called New Year's money. Children accept it with joy. This kind of practice cultivates children's base mentality of worshiping money and is extremely easy to form bad tendencies in education. Those who care about children's education should thoroughly reform it. It is better to replace it with children's toys with educational value, so that the same giving and receiving can not only express emotions, but also increase knowledge. Kangyuan Factory's toys are educational, scientific, national defense-related, and intelligence-developing. In various forms, they are all sufficient to increase children's knowledge, cultivate good character, and promote the patriotic spirit of young citizens. It is hoped that fathers and brothers in China will study it.

### Love the Battlefield

— Chen Tiewu

Lovable battlefield,

How heroic the gunshots are!

How magnificent the gleam of swords is!

This is the direction to run towards for survival,

Here, you can find the food of life.

Bugles compete, flags flutter, the two armies fight hand-to-hand,

See the bayonet pierce the enemy's chest.

A little bit of fresh red blood

Can win immeasurable happiness;

Sacrificing one's own life

Enables the entire nation to eliminate the strong and violent.

I love my motherland, hoping it will always prosper;

I love my hometown, hoping it will always shine;

I love my parents and siblings even more, wishing them eternal well-being;

Because I:

Love my motherland, love my parents and siblings, love my hometown,

Therefore, I love the battlefield even more.

### Electric Heating Aviation Suit Utilizing Wind Power

— Dong Xun

In the upper atmosphere, the climate is extremely cold, especially in the high altitudes of the frigid zone! Therefore, when an aircraft pilot flies at an altitude of thousands of meters, he must wear very thick leather clothing in order to resist the severe cold air. However, wearing very thick leather clothing is very inconvenient to operate. Therefore, recently, someone invented an electric heating aviation suit, which gives flyers great convenience!

This electric heating aviation suit utilizes wind power to generate electric heat. Wires are used to distribute it in an ordinary aviation suit according to the circuit in the attached figure. One end of the wires is connected to a regulator, and the other side of the regulator is connected to a generator. The generator is installed on the wing or foot of the aircraft. When the aircraft is running, the propeller on the generator is rotated by the wind power, thus generating a current. This current passes through the regulator and enters various parts of the aviation suit. With such an aviation suit, the pilot can not be afraid of the cold climate!

This aviation suit uses wind power to generate electric heat and does not require any cost. What a meritorious invention for the aviation industry!

### Righteousness (3)

— Qing

Forty-four strong sailors dared to risk their lives and climbed the rope to the other side. The forty-fifth person turned around and saw a poor woman lying exhausted and weakly on the rock, almost unable to move. He stretched out an arm to hug her, holding onto the rope with one hand. Oh no! Because the rope had been used for too long, it could no longer withstand the weight of two people, and it broke in the middle. Alas, the sailor and the woman immediately fell into the water and were swallowed by the whirlpool. At this time, Captain Begg and three sailors were still left on the reef, completely isolated from the other side and trapped in despair. The sailors on the shore rushed to try to rescue them. After a while, they found a rope in a farmer's house and rushed to the shore. However, the ruthless tide, without waiting for them to return, had already swallowed the brave captain. The sailors were moved by the captain's righteousness and wrote a very moving letter to an officer who had been on the "Drake" ship, requesting him to report the captain's martyrdom to the Navy Department.

The letter said: "In fact, he has proven himself to be a good man from beginning to end, and his name and final actions should receive the highest evaluation. We sailors feel that we have the responsibility to request the highest commander of the Navy Department to publicly commend this generous and righteous leader who is unparalleled at the time. He sacrificed his life for us on the evening of June 23." This letter was signed by all the surviving sailors of the "Drake" ship. Later, a monument was erected in the chapel of the Portsmouth Shipyard to commemorate the righteous Captain Begg.

The sailors who had just returned from the sea had seen Captain Begg's resolute and solemn face, and had heard the captain's calm and firm speech. Of course, they felt that their leader's generosity and righteousness were unmatched. However, such moving deeds often continue to be performed on uninhabited reefs, beside icy and cold icebergs, and among the turbulent waves of the vast sea, constantly producing these generous martyrs.

From the cold fog of Newfoundland, let us move to the most beautiful Cape Li Hai on the ocean. There is a deep blue tropical sky, reflecting the deeper blue water below, shining brightly under the fierce sunlight, dotted with islands of secluded forests, forming the most beautiful summer scene in the world.

But this most beautiful sea is also the most dangerous place. This is simply the home of hurricanes and the residence of raging waves. Very terrible storms often arise in an instant, without any warning in advance, but only a slight indication in the sky, which is not easily noticed unless it is an experienced old navigator. Although the mercury on the thermometer will also drop suddenly, there is no change before the storm initially breaks out, and there is almost not a minute of work left for the ship to prepare everything to resist this inhuman enemy.

Small Talk

### Old Rules for the New Year

— Luo Caiqing

The New Year is here, naturally referring to the Lunar New Year. However, in this short piece, I don't want to discuss the customs, whether they're easy or difficult. Let me just quote a passage from Mr. Lu Xun: "The prohibition of the Lunar calendar this year is indeed trivial and doesn't affect the big picture, but merchants are certainly crying in despair. Not only that, even the unemployed vagrants and company employees in Shanghai often sigh deeply, saying it's very inconvenient for farmers' cultivation or for sailors' tide watching. They surprisingly start thinking about the farmers in the countryside and the boatmen at sea, whom they haven't concerned themselves with for a long time. This is truly a bit like universal love... The calendar indeed has removed the Lunar calendar, only retaining the solar terms. However, on the other hand, advertisements for the '120-Year Combined Lunar-Solar Calendar' appear in the newspapers. Good, they've already prepared the Lunar calendar for the times of their great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren, 120 years!"

Good, let's see after 120 years. For now, let's still celebrate our Lunar New Year. For the Lunar New Year, there are two important things to do: haircut and bathing. Chinese people do everything from the beginning, starting anew. Not only do people wear new clothes, new hats, new shoes, and new socks on New Year's Day, but even this old skin has to be given a new look. Therefore, on New Year's Eve, the bathhouses and barbershops are overcrowded. This is indeed because the situation of the old year was too bad, so people place their hopes on the new year to start anew. Also, because of this "hope," bathhouses and barbershops have "old rules for the New Year." The so-called "old rules for the New Year" in barbershops is "double the price for everyone." In bathhouses, there is an additional "windfall"—giving candied olives (ganlan) symbolizing "giving yuanbao" (old Chinese currency). Giving yuanbao fits their "hope," so spending a few extra auspicious coins to gamble for great fortune in the New Year is truly something they're happy to do.

However, the auspiciousness of "giving yuanbao" has also reached a day of failure, because after giving yuanbao, hope remains the same as the old year, making those few coins spent a waste. Yesterday, I walked past the entrance of a bathhouse and saw a large red paper pasted on the gleaming glass window, on which was written "Abolish Old Rules, No Candied Olives Given" in eight large characters. Businessmen always pay attention to auspiciousness, but now they clearly tell people that they won't be giving yuanbao. However, on the contrary, that bathhouse may be able to do more business. There's no need for me to be verbose about the reason. Just look at the clearance advertisements in the newspapers and the shops that have applied paint seals, and you'll know that merchants are being attacked by other storms and are "crying in despair." They have no choice but to "abolish old rules" to support their last hope. At this final juncture, we are indeed a little worried about the "120-Year Combined Lunar-Solar Calendar." When the great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren are born, perhaps it will be even more "completely changed"?

### Production

— Wang Shengtian

"Ah, while the firewood hasn't died out yet, quickly bring the cotton quilt to warm it!"

"Warm it? ... What's the point of warming it! Really, I didn't expect that as the years go by, you'd become more muddled year after year."

"Don't talk to me in such a bad tone..."

"A bad tone? What do you want?"

"I'm saying be careful in life, and things will get better in the future!"

"Better? How is this year compared to last year? And how was last year compared to the year before?"

When she heard her daughter-in-law's words, it was as if a pot of cold water was poured on her heart. Her words were stuffed from her throat into her stomach, like a corn bun being stuffed into the mouth. The firewood gradually went out, and those sparks were like the distant horizon on a cloudy night, with a patch of clouds embedded with not very bright stars!

"Even if things are bad, we still have to get by!"

"A hellish life... Your son ruined me!"

A lamp flickered, squeezed back and forth in the path of the wind. Her hair seemed to be covered with a layer of flour. Her daughter-in-law's belly protruded, and she lowered her head, lifting her apron to wipe her tears.

"Pregnant women should be patient with everything. If you act like this, you'll harm yourself."

"I can't bear this devilish time..."

"My ancestral mother, please watch your words!"

Her wrinkled eyelids and cheeks streamed with tears, like accumulated water on the mountaintop dripping down through the cliff rocks. She tried several times to stop her tears, calm herself, and think about tomorrow, but as soon as she started thinking about tomorrow, the tears started falling again!

"Heaven, the compassionate Guan Yin, I pray you bless, bless my daughter-in-law... May my daughter-in-law not deliver today... Ah, Heaven will protect us from it happening today..."

She clasped her hands, looked up to the sky, and prayed.

She still struggled into the house, looking at her daughter-in-law leaning against the stove, exhausted in the quilt. She looked at her gentle face and smiled bitterly for a moment. Suddenly, her stomach began to cramp, and hunger relentlessly pursued her.

"Ah, Heaven, this is... Could it be that I'm going to... faint? ...going to die...?" She couldn't hold back the pain in her heart. She remembered that today was New Year's Eve, and firecrackers were roaring wildly in the streets and alleys. She remembered that today was the last month of her daughter-in-law's pregnancy, and perhaps even the last day of the month. She thought about how her daughter-in-law hadn't eaten two meals, and her own stomach couldn't bear the hunger either. So she gritted her teeth, put the raw sweet potato from the jar into a bowl, mashed it with the handle of the knife, picked it up, and ate it, trying to perk herself up.

Seeing that her daughter-in-law was sleeping peacefully, her heart was a little relieved, but when she heard the sound of firecrackers, her heart became agitated again. When the sound of firecrackers subsided, with only occasional sounds, she thought A'gen was knocking on the door, and she focused her vision on the threshold.

A'gen was her only son, working as a dyer two hundred miles away.

"Why hasn't he come back at this hour? He must be carrying a lot of things and be very tired! ... Ah, may Heaven protect us, may today... pass quietly, as long as the little thing in her belly..." Thinking of this, a trace of a smile appeared on the corner of her mouth.

But when she thought that today was New Year's Eve, she became dazed again, as if insulted by someone, and quietly vented her resentment with tears.

"Ouch... Mother!" Suddenly, her daughter-in-law woke up from her dream and shouted.

Her face was pale, her teeth were clenched tightly, her hands were supporting the legs of the table, and her head was shaking. Seeing her daughter-in-law like this, she knew things were not right, and quickly went to the yard to get straw.

Outside the door was the dark red sky, and firecrackers were ringing all around, as if broadcasting the misfortune of this family, and seemingly singing of the unfairness of the world.

### Night Journey in the Mountains

— Zhifu

In the fading sunlight, on the road fifteen miles from the Nipo River, this group of strong men returning from Ukraine walked along the vast meadow. The fields were gray and dim, and the villages were shrouded in heavy mist. Only the Latona hills in front still stood tall and majestic, but they also appeared somewhat black and indistinct. When going up the mountain, the small white flags along the mountain path nodded to everyone, swaying in the night wind. The earthen forts seemed like crawling insects, lazily lying on the shaded side of the hillside. At this time, Carbokilov and his group of five people braved the harsh night wind to cross the continuous fortresses and head to a desolate village in the valley.

Among this group of people, Fink and Tuggart were Tartar miners, and the other three were White Russian farmers. They walked around a meadow, talking and laughing as they went. Tuggart was simply regarded as a mischievous child by everyone.

"Hey! When are you planning to go to Minsk again, Tuggart?"

"What for? I don't want to go for the time being because of work!"

"Oh! Have you forgotten the girl Mishana?......"

"Mishana? ... I have never forgotten her for a single day."

"Oh, oh! You kid,... good kid!..."

Carbokilov asked and laughed, the laughter seeming to come from his throat, low, trembling, and not loud. Clearly, he had inhaled too much Belyehov㊀ and become like this!

The boy Tuggart now only had a faint smile on his face and lowered his head. When everyone entered the forest, the noisy sounds stopped. Because at the end of that dark forest was a high and sturdy mountain path. Here, you had to hold your breath and strive to move forward.

In the forest, the sky was even darker, and the air was deadly silent. Everyone lowered their heads, seeking a flat path to advance. Suddenly, a burst of wild laughter followed by a loud shout from the person in front:

"Uh!... I also thought of that Mishana girl's face."

"What about her face, Fink!" Tuggart stopped and anxiously asked.

"I think about her! I think... uh, I'll tell you later!"

These words made the other three laugh. Only Tuggart was not very happy, and a mysterious tension appeared on his face. At the same time, he remembered Fink's ridiculous tone just now. Thinking about it, he became annoyed, fell back to stand shoulder to shoulder with Carbokilov, and began to talk:

"Don't think anything of it, Miss Mishana now has opportunities, do you know?......"

"Oh!... I don't know much! I heard she's a milkmaid, and some say she's the daughter of an old miner..."

Carbokilov turned his head and asked, still in a low, trembling tone. He then picked up his second pinch of Zhelehov and sucked it wildly near his nose.

"That's right—she was originally a miner's daughter and also delivered milk for people. But she's not like that now—I met her a week ago in a village east of Minsk, and she has already joined the women's association."

"Hmm! That's her?" Carbokilov expressed admiration, and after a while, asked further: "Tuggart, how is she with you?"

"That's probably a very ordinary thing!... ..." Tuggart hesitated slightly for a moment and continued: "But my feelings with her father are not ordinary!...

"I'll tell you: I met her four years ago living in one of her villages. She was very young then!... But unfortunately, her father went to the border and died in the Dola Mountains, and since then she has been wandering everywhere... without a trace of news. When I feel lonely, I often think of her and her deceased father, and sometimes I even cry... because I have lost a beloved and rare elder! But last year, I went to Minsk again and accidentally met her on the street. She was delivering milk for people, but judging from her words, she has completely become a new woman of the times!"

Carbokilov sighed: "Yes! I deeply wish your spiritual union, the masses will gain so much more happiness!"

"Yes, maybe she won't abandon me because I'm a miner!... ..." Finally, a faint, excited smile spread across Tuggart's face again.

Mount Latona was even quieter! This group of people still had to travel at least a dozen miles to a desolate village in the mountains to find their destination.

Note: ㊀ Belyehov—a type of snuff that Russians like.

### Xiangxiang the Blind

— Li Ang

The village gossips are best at giving people nicknames. For example, Xiangxiang in the third house in the west village only had a left eye that looked like a ginkgo nut, so they called him Xiangxiang the Blind. Over the years, the nickname stuck, and he himself couldn't deny this unflattering nickname. His father passed the Xiucai exam during the late Qing dynasty. The large red certificate, which had turned pink, then pinkish-white, and almost all white, with the writing barely visible, was still pasted in the front hall of the third house. When the Republic came, the Xiucai degree was worthless. He closed the book chest and started lending money and rice. He lent it out in the first half of the year and collected it in the second half. Since childhood, Xiangxiang the Blind followed his father to lend money. They had been to Liyang, Jurong, and even the distant Anhui province.

Those were good years. Business was easy, and the accounts were clear. In December, Xiangxiang the Blind and his father always returned from collecting debts with brand-new watermelon-rind hats, shiny silk robes, and iron-weave duck-tongue shoes. Behind them followed seven or eight rickshaws (small military carts with chairs) slowly walking along the high bank towards the village. It was truly enviable. The men and women working in the fields would stop and hold up their hoes or plows, watching them from afar: "The rich man is back, the rich man is back." They kept saying it until they passed in front of them, and then they would raise their voices and say it with a welcoming smile, feeling happy as if they themselves, not Xiangxiang the Blind and his father, were the ones who had become rich.

"Xiangxiang is really growing up fast. He's like an adult after not seeing him for a few months. I'll be a matchmaker for him. You should have a grandson soon," everyone said, trying to arrange a marriage. Even those without daughters wanted to find Xiangxiang the Blind as a nephew-in-law or grandson-in-law, as if that would bring them glory. "It's early, it's early. We need to take our time and choose carefully," Xiangxiang's father replied. Naturally, with money, there was no fear of not finding a good wife. Even a blind man wouldn't have to worry. In this way, the families with daughters kept their daughters at home, waiting for an opportunity, as if they had hope.

But Xiangxiang the Blind's father died in the year of the war. The reason was that he couldn't collect all the lent money, got frightened on the road, and caught a cold. He became ill as soon as he got home. Xiangxiang the Blind took over the few hundred dollars of capital left by his father and started doing business alone. For the first two years, he managed to break even. The villagers' comments about him were still good. It wasn't easy for a young man to do business outside alone without going astray.

Unfortunately, the weather was uncooperative, with either droughts or floods. Anhui was plagued by bandits. Each year, the business got worse, while the expenses increased. Xiangxiang the Blind's capital decreased year after year. He felt that lending money was not the way to go, but what would happen if he stopped? Farming? He had never worked in the fields or held a hoe since he was a child. When he was idle at home in the summer, he passively played cards at the Widow Zoumalou's house, eating braised pig head and drinking yellow soup (liquor). As a result, the elderly people's impression of him worsened: "Xiangxiang the Blind has gone astray. He has no ambition. No wonder he's running out of money." Those who had offered to arrange marriages and those with daughters secretly rejoiced.

The gossips took the opportunity to fabricate many stories about Xiangxiang the Blind and the widow, saying that the door shouldn't be closed during the day, and that they had personally seen Xiangxiang the Blind sneak into Zoumalou at night. It was as if they lived in the world just to find out these news.

In December, Xiangxiang the Blind came back again to collect debts. No one believed that he had returned as a beggar, wearing a set of dirty, insect-infested short jacket and pants, barefoot, with a three-inch-long scar on his arm. He said that his capital and luggage had been robbed in Jiangbei, and he had barely saved his life—but who believed him? The villagers said that he had been fooling around and wasting everything outside, and that he had been useless since he was a child. Xiangxiang the Blind fell from grace and received no sympathy from the village.

Film

### Nanjing Will Show "Flying Swallow Welcomes Spring"

As the Lunar New Year approaches, the Nanjing Grand Theatre will screen the song and dance blockbuster "Flying Swallow Welcomes Spring" again starting on the 10th of this month. The film is a pure song, dance, and humorous light comedy. The main roles are all stars from last year's amazing masterpiece "Phoenix Paying Homage to the Sun." The lead actress, Elana Powell, is charming and lovely. In America, she is known as the queen of "tap dance." In this film, she will fully demonstrate her strengths, dancing and singing beautifully. The male lead is the romantic young man James Stewart. James has always been praised in Hollywood as a well-dressed and pleasing figure. In this film, he complements Elana perfectly. Supporting actors include Virginia Bruce and singer Francis Lanford. When the film premiered in New York, film critics unanimously praised it as being even better than the famous film "The Great Ziegfeld."

### Shanghai Grand Theatre to Screen Cantonese Film "Words are a Weapon" on New Year's Day

The Shanghai Grand Theatre will screen the Cantonese film "Words are a Weapon" during the Lunar New Year. This is the first Cantonese sound film to be screened in Shanghai. However, apart from a few Cantonese songs that have been preserved, the Cantonese dialogue was cut from the soundtrack during the Central Film Censorship Committee's review.

The Cantonese songs "Beautiful Spring Scenery" and "Little Fishing Fire" are both very melodious. In addition, there is also an English song, all accompanied by Cantonese music.

The female lead of this film is Li Qinian, who is as popular in the South as Hu Die is here.

The story narrates the experiences of a young couple after being slandered, trying to illustrate how terrifying gossip can be in Chinese society.

This is the first time a Cantonese film has been screened in Shanghai, and it should be a film that attracts attention not only from the Cantonese community.

### "Spring Comes to the World"

"Spring Comes to the World" has been completely filmed and is now being carefully edited by director Sun Yu. Director Sun spends every day from 6 am to 11 pm working with the film reels and splicers, truly a dedicated and hardworking effort.

"Spring Comes to the World" is a major work that Sun Yu rushed to complete after "Go to Nature." In this coming winter season, the screen will be decorated with peach and willow trees, a ten-mile spring village, maintaining his consistent poetic style. He can also be called a saintly master of changing nature.

The main actors in "Spring Comes to the World" are Chen Yanyan and Mei Xi. Chen Yanyan, this beautiful little bird, has already received much praise in "Lonely City Heroine." It is expected that "Spring Comes to the World" will cause a stir again. Mei Xi and Chen Yanyan are collaborating for the first time, and their skills are evenly matched, creating a wonderful combination.

The theme song of "Spring Comes to the World," also titled "Spring Comes to the World," is written by Sun Yu and composed by He Luting, and will be recorded by Pathé Records. The lyrics are as follows:

The spring light is short, the spring light is fading, the late summer roses sadly complain!

The autumn wind blows, the autumn clouds darken, in the blink of an eye, ice and frost cut off human smoke!

Do not feel sad walking on the snowy ground, winter and spring are companions.

Since winter has already come to the world, how can spring be far away?

Do not sigh, do not fear the cold, use your warm heart to melt the frost!

Have courage, smile forward, use your strength to overcome difficulties!

Do not feel sad walking on the snowy ground, winter and spring are companions?

Since winter has already come to the world, how can spring be far away?

"Spring Comes to the World" will be screened at the Carlton starting from the Lunar New Year's Day.
