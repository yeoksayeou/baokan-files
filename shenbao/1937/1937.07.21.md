Both sides must take swift action to avoid escalating the situation. If it is said that there are objectionable aspects to the troop movements of the Chinese army in Hebei Province, then the presence of a large number of Japanese troops in the province is even more obviously an infringement on China's territorial sovereignty. Minister Wang then reiterated the proposals in yesterday's aide-mémoire, saying that both sides should immediately agree on a date to simultaneously cease military actions and withdraw troops, as this is the only possible way to avoid conflict. Mr. Wang also stated that since both sides have said that they do not want to escalate the situation and that the dispatch of troops is merely a precaution, there is no reason not to accept China's proposal. Regarding the matter of local negotiations, Minister Wang stated that diplomacy in any country is handled by the central government. As far as this incident is concerned, the Chinese government is always prepared to negotiate with the Japanese government to seek a swift and fair resolution. If there are local matters that can be resolved locally, it must also be with the permission of the Chinese central government. Finally, Minister Wang also stated that the Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its strong desire to achieve a peaceful resolution of this unfortunate incident. As long as there is a glimmer of hope for peace, China will never abandon its efforts to pursue a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Repel Attackers With Attack

— Yong

Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek publicly delivered his speech the day before yesterday, our country's attitude towards the Japanese military's provocation has been firmly expressed. Since the 29th Army fought bravely at Lugouqiao and Fengtai yesterday, our country's defense and resistance have made factual progress. Before this, frontline contact was always uncertain, with wavering on whether to fight or make peace. But today, the curtain has been raised, and there is no turning back. Our country has united 450 million people as one, with one heart, to fight those who invade and plunder us, and determine the outcome on the battlefield.

Our country has 5,000 years of culture. All civilized and progressive people love peace, respect etiquette and justice, and do not advocate war. They know that war can destroy civilization, and it should not be used lightly unless absolutely necessary. The world is becoming increasingly progressive, and international organizations are establishing mechanisms and drafting conventions to eliminate war. Civilized countries, even with conflicts of interest, are reluctant to start wars. But ambitious people take advantage of people's desire for peace to satisfy their desire for expansion. For example, Japan towards our country. Since the September 18th Incident, from the three northeastern provinces to Rehe, and then to further encroach on our Beiping and Tianjin. We encourage ourselves with peace, but they brutally add military force. We used reason to negotiate, but they oppressed us with military power. They turned a blind eye to conventions and rejected all mediation, to the extreme of their ambition. They want to destroy our history and occupy our territory, making attacks their ability and invasion their routine. This makes it necessary for us today to repel attackers with attack, and embark on the path of resistance to preserve the fate of our nation. We are right and strong, and there is no need for divination. And the suffering of the Japanese people is all due to the poison of their ambitious people. No one who acts alone and violently can survive. So the attack on people will also be struck, and this is predictable.

Looking back at the situation in North China, since the fall of Rehe, violence has been directed at Beiping and Tianjin for five years. At that time, we still encouraged ourselves with peace, and there was the Tanggu Truce, hoping to realize the initial intention of internal self-preservation and external coexistence. But the Japanese took an inch and wanted to place Beiping and Tianjin under their noses. Fortunately, Song Zheyuan of the Hebei-Chahar authorities firmly laid the foundation for the overall situation at the time of crisis. The brave soldiers of our 29th Army who supported were being stimulated by the battles of Xifengkou and Lengkou. The scars everywhere left memories of vowing to repay the country with death. They were stationed in Beiping and Tianjin to continue their duty of defending the territory and protecting the country. Judging from their state of mind, no matter when or where, as long as they can express their loyalty for the nation and justice, who would be willing to be a step behind in wielding their knives and mounting their horses? But unfortunately, there was another scene of the retreat from Fengtai. We seek to preserve the whole by compromising, while others oppress us unreasonably. We had to let soldiers change defenses in tears. As for today, what is contained is getting deeper and deeper, and what is expressed is becoming stronger and stronger. Wanping, a solitary city in the wilderness, resolutely resisted and fought, enough to see the early signs of a sure victory.

As for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's position on the country, he has repeatedly emphasized it, and everyone understands it. In recent years, he has especially focused on external troubles and devoted himself to all military and political construction. All parties in the country have recognized his loyalty and moved towards unification. Chairman Chiang himself is even more able to actively lead and handle things with ease. The declaration is clear and profound, explaining the country's position and the minimum bottom line. The life of the entire nation. His leadership of the whole country, encouragement of the people, and even declaration to Japan, all come from deep sincerity. He is resolute and encourages the weak. I dare to believe that the officers and soldiers of our loyal and brave national army, and even the people of the whole country, will be able to "resolve to sacrifice everything" and never "give up an inch of land and sovereignty" to avoid falling into "the eternal sinners of the Chinese nation." This can be asserted.

### Two American Women Kicked by Japanese Soldiers in Beiping

[Beiping] American widows Mrs. Jones and Ms. Rathrop were mistreated by Japanese soldiers outside the Japanese Embassy last night.

Ms. Rathrop also said, "The soldiers were noisy at the time and pushed us both very rudely." Mrs. Jones and her companion were later released, but as the two women were leaving, a sentry kicked Mrs. Jones from behind. The American Embassy has now notified the Japanese Embassy of this matter and requested attention. (Reuters, 20th Central News Agency)

### Chiang Kai-shek's Declaration Unanimously Praised by International Public Opinion

British newspaper believes the wording is firm and tactful; German newspaper says we have the determination to clarify the situation

[London] British newspapers have recently continued to comment on the Far East situation. The News Chronicle reported that the responsibility for maintaining peace should be borne by Japan. General Chiang Kai-shek's declaration yesterday was firm and tactful, expressing a willingness to maintain peace on the one hand, and proposing practical suggestions on the other, which can be described as prudent and thoughtful. What the world should know is that he possesses a China with 400 million people, which cannot be easily destroyed. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that "Neither Nanjing nor Tokyo intends to start a major war. It is hoped that diplomats from both China and Japan can find a solution that is acceptable to both parties." The Morning Post reported that "Japan may be able to defeat China, but cannot conquer it. China may be able to resist Japan, but it will be greatly injured." (Havas, 20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[London] The Manchester Guardian commented on the Far East situation today, saying that the terms of the Treaty of Versailles in the Far East rarely have an expiration date, because the Far East understands the art of bargaining far better than the West. Therefore, the Nanjing government's rejection of Japan's demands does not necessarily mean the end of negotiations. There is no doubt that the current situation is critical, but it is worth noting that Chairman Chiang's statement clearly recognizes the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and insists only that any solution must not hinder China's land and sovereignty. Nanjing has not taken any action that can be condemned as aggression. This can be clearly stated. Even if a secret agreement existed that China was not allowed to move its own troops in its own province, this agreement should have been cancelled by the arrival of Japanese troops in the province. (Reuters, 20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[London] Regarding Prime Minister Eden's statement in the House of Commons the other day that he intended to assist China and Japan in resolving their disputes, the London Morning Post stated that an Anglo-Japanese agreement is being discussed. After it is established in the future, the friendship between Britain and Japan will be strengthened, and Britain and Japan can cooperate peacefully with China to start the world's largest market. But peace is the only condition. Without peace, the Far East will not progress for decades. (Reuters, 20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Berlin] German newspapers commented on the Sino-Japanese situation, believing that the Chinese government has the determination to clarify the situation. This determination is due to the following reasons: ㊀ China's increasing national strength, ㊁ Japan's domestic and foreign difficulties, ㊂ the attitudes of countries such as Britain and the United States. It also said that European countries attach importance to disputes related to their own countries and pay little attention to China's administrative reforms and defense progress. (National Seaborne Telegram, 20th)

[Paris] French newspapers have recently continued to comment on the Far East situation. The right-wing Figaro reported that "If the Japanese General Staff did not have the confidence to end the war with China quickly, and if their spy agencies were not sure that Soviet Russia would not take the opportunity to attack Manchuria, they would not send a large number of troops to China." The communist L'Humanité reported that "The fascist countries originally hoped that Britain would be an accomplice in the Spanish issue, and they think the same about the China issue. Although the United States' attitude towards peace disruptors is becoming increasingly firm, it is not what they want." (Havas, 20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Wang Zhengting Discusses Japanese Conspiracy

Aiming to Encroach on China

I sincerely hope that Japan will not make the situation more serious, otherwise it will only plunge the Far East continent into great chaos, and the result will disturb world peace. The Chinese government has reiterated to Japan its willingness to withdraw troops simultaneously and peacefully resolve the Lugouqiao Incident. (National Telegram, 19th)

### US Treasury Secretary Considers Sino-Japanese Issue

Whether it will affect the monetary agreement

[Washington] Treasury Secretary Ghen Kindler stated today that he may ask Attorney General Cummings whether the recently signed Sino-US monetary agreement will be affected if the United States implements the Neutrality Act due to the crisis between China and Japan. Some authorities have expressed the opinion that although the law stipulates that all credit loans to belligerent countries are prohibited, only private loans are prohibited.

The table prepared by Haas is based on materials such as the League of Nations Military Yearbook. From this, we can see the increase in military spending by various countries during the five years from 1932 to 1936. It is now transcribed as follows: (Unit: Million Yuan)

Note: A includes Abyssinian war expenses; B The sum of the three numbers above does not match.

In the current situation, as a result of the establishment of a £1.5 billion national defense plan, Britain's military expenditure this year is four times that of before the war. France has established a four-year national defense plan with a total amount of 19 billion francs (approximately 3.2 billion in national currency), and its military expenditure this year is also several times higher than before the war. The speed at which Germany, Italy, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United States are expanding their armaments is, of course, equally alarming. As for the smaller countries, this year the Netherlands has increased its national defense expenditure by 80 million yuan in special expenses. Poland borrowed a huge debt of 400 million yuan from France to cover its domestic military expenditure. Czechoslovakia issued 400 million yuan in national defense public bonds. Other countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and Turkey are also committed to national defense and vigorously developing armaments.

As a result of the expansion of armaments by various countries, private enterprises are experiencing difficulties in obtaining capital, raw materials, and skilled workers, which affects the commodity market. As a result, prices are soaring, and the living standards of the people are being forced to decline. On the other hand, in order to raise military expenditure, governments have to borrow money to supplement the shortage of legitimate financial resources, which leads to severe credit expansion and makes the social economy even more insecure. In short, the unlimited expansion of armaments by various countries has the potential to trigger a world war. Even if we disregard this possibility, the direct impact alone is enough to make us feel apprehensive.

### 700,000 Soviet Party Members Expelled

Accounting for a Quarter of the Total Communist Party Membership; Expressing Extreme Sympathy for China's Resistance Against Japan

[London] According to recent news from Moscow, the Soviet Union is closely watching China's resistance against Japan with extreme sympathy. Soviet sources say that China should not expect anything more than moral support from the Soviet Union. The Soviet administrative organs and the Communist Party are still continuing their purge work, determined to eliminate all reactionary elements. To date, a quarter of the total Communist Party membership, approximately 700,000 people, have either been expelled from the party, arrested, or executed by the party without the slightest leniency. In addition, the Soviet government had previously decided to establish military soviets in various military districts to strengthen political management. Later, many military leaders, fearing that their personal authority and military discipline would be hindered, immediately raised objections, resulting in disputes and widespread elimination. Regarding foreign affairs, the former Chief of the General Staff of the Army, Tukhachevsky, and several senior generals reportedly proposed that if the Soviet Union was not prepared to go to war with Germany, it should approach Germany so that it could have freedom of action in the Far East without worrying about the rear. This was because Stalin, the Soviet dictator, believed that war was not necessarily inevitable, at least not for a considerable period of time. (Havas Dispatch, 20th, Central News Agency)

[Moscow] According to a newspaper here, on July 10th, twenty-four railway officials in Pavlyukovo were executed after being found guilty of espionage. All of them were members of the Trotsky faction and were part of a Japanese terrorist spy agency operating on the Volochaevka branch of the Far Eastern Railway. The newspaper also published the names of 130 people who had been executed in the Far East for espionage in the past ten weeks. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th, Central News Agency)

### American-Russian Flight

Famous American Aviator to Take Off on August 10th

[San Francisco] Famous American aviator Madden, who attempted a non-stop flight between the United States and Russia in 1933, was lost in Siberia. Although he was rescued by Soviet aviators, he was unable to complete the feat. As Soviet aviators Chkalov and Gromov have since flown to the United States via the North Pole, Madden has decided to take off from California on August 10th for Moscow, also via the North Pole. The aircraft used is a Lockheed equipped with two engines with a speed of 400 kilometers per hour. (Havas Dispatch, 20th, Central News Agency)

[Moscow] According to news received here, the aircraft flown to San Francisco by Soviet aviator Gromov had its equipment unloaded in the United States before flying to Moscow.

### British House of Commons Discusses Sino-Japanese Problem

Both War and Peace Are Possible; Britain Continues to Liaise with the United States and France; Willing to Mediate If Needed

[London] The House of Commons discussed the government's foreign policy today. Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a lengthy speech explaining the international situation. Many foreign envoys to Britain attended, including the ambassadors of China, the United States, Belgium, and Poland, the ministers of Switzerland and Czechoslovakia, and officials from the Japanese Embassy. Eden's speech first addressed the Far East issue, stating that the situation in the Far East is still uncertain. The British government has expressed its hope to the Chinese and Japanese governments that the dispute will be resolved peacefully. The British government is maintaining close contact with the governments of the United States and France, whose opinions are the same as Britain's, and who are extremely concerned about the dispute and hope for a peaceful resolution. However, a peaceful solution is most likely to succeed through direct consultations between China and Japan. As for third countries, in addition to expressing their natural concern for maintaining peace, they should not intervene. "We have informed the Chinese and Japanese authorities that any other government that can assist in resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute will be happy to do its part within its capabilities." He then said, "If the unstable situation in North China continues to exist and incidents continue to occur, and if these are dealt with reluctantly through local solutions, and the effectiveness and scope of these solutions are highly questionable, then the situation will remain fraught with danger." (Havas Dispatch, 20th, Central News Agency)

[London] Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne concluded the debate by saying that as far as the British government knows, both the Chinese and Japanese governments do not want to resort to terrible war. There is now a very great danger that the two countries will be drawn into the vortex of war, but the British government still sincerely hopes that a peaceful solution is still possible. If the British government needs to help in any solution, the British government is always willing to contribute. The British government wants to act jointly with the United States and has already contacted the United States and intends to continue to contact it in the future. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th, Central News Agency)

[London] The House of Commons met today, and Foreign Secretary Eden, in reply to a question from opposition leader Attlee regarding the situation in China, said that the British government is currently in close contact with all relevant governments step by step. There is little news in addition to what he told the House of Commons yesterday. He has not yet received information on the Chinese government's response to the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires' note of July 17th. As for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's declaration, he has received news in the consulate. Attlee also asked whether it was true that Japanese troops bombed a certain town, presumably Wanping, as reported in the newspapers. The Foreign Secretary replied that he had not yet received any information. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th, Central News Agency)

### British Foreign Secretary Eden Announces International Policy

Absolutely No Participation in Ideological Blocs; Anglo-French Cooperation is Key to European Peace

[London] In the second part of his speech, British Foreign Secretary Eden addressed the Spanish question, expressing satisfaction that the Adjustment Committee had accepted the British compromise proposal as a basis for discussion. He stated, "This compromise proposal must be made to succeed; otherwise, foreign powers will intensify their interference in the Spanish Civil War, and the future of Europe will inevitably face immense danger. This danger existed last autumn, but fortunately, former French Prime Minister Blum proposed the Non-Intervention Agreement, and the danger was thus avoided." Eden then spoke about the Mediterranean issue, saying, "Britain is determined to defend its interests in the Mediterranean, just as it does its interests everywhere else, but does not intend to exclude any other country from the Mediterranean. In short, we will always adhere to the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement regarding the Mediterranean." He then discussed the ongoing trade negotiations between Britain and the United States, saying that both countries believe such a trade agreement would greatly benefit the development of international trade. Regarding the League of Nations, he said that the League has neither died nor is it on its last legs. He then solemnly declared that Britain has decided never to participate in any ideological bloc, neither the anti-communist bloc nor the anti-fascist bloc. He praised the recent signing of naval treaties between the Soviet Union and Germany with Britain separately, saying that the cooperation between Russia and Germany can be evidenced by this. Finally, Eden elaborated on the friendly relations between Britain and France, stating that since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War twelve months ago, Europe has safely passed through without any terrible conflict, which is mainly due to the friendship between Britain and France. In conclusion, he said, "The Spanish Civil War has created a major crisis in Europe, but after twelve months, it has not led to major changes. Even if various countries express fervent sympathy for any party involved in the Spanish Civil War, they are unwilling to expand the Spanish Civil War beyond Spain. It can be seen that the future of Europe is quite optimistic. A year ago, I hoped that all disputes could be resolved and peace could be preserved. Today, I still hold this hope, and it is even stronger than before."

After Foreign Secretary Eden finished his speech, opposition Labour Party member Dalton, an expert on foreign affairs for the party, spoke first. He mentioned the situation in the Far East, saying that he hopes Britain will work with the United States to maintain peace in the Far East. Regarding the Spanish question, he said that from Britain's point of view, it would be advantageous to limit the Spanish Nationalist forces from becoming too powerful. As for the Mediterranean, if Germany and Italy were to intervene, the lines of communication between Britain, France, and their colonies would be directly threatened. (Central News Agency, Havana, 18th)

[London] Churchill then stated that the Spanish Nationalist forces have erected large cannons around and near Gibraltar, which are not necessary for the Spanish Civil War. If Nationalist leader Franco intends to control Gibraltar and the Strait, Britain cannot ignore it. Lloyd George also stated that the power of these cannons is sufficient to blockade the Strait, and that the intention of one of the fascist countries close to Franco is very clear, which is to control the Mediterranean. The reason why these fascist countries sent troops to Spain is also because Spain can control the Mediterranean. If the Suez Canal is once blockaded by others, the only other route would be around the Cape of Good Hope, but if Spain is used as a base for submarines and air forces by an enemy country, that route will also be threatened. Lloyd George continued, Portugal is now closely colluding with Franco, which can be seen from the fact that it is closer to the Balearic Islands being controlled by fascists. If Franco achieves victory in Spain with the help of Italian volunteer soldiers and German experts and cannons, he will become an important figure in the German-Italian alliance, and no one will dare to confront him. Lloyd George further stated that regarding the non-intervention policy, the previous three agreements have all been broken. The current plan should aim to restore international credibility before a new agreement can be made. He advocated that surveillance is unnecessary, and all countries must adhere to neutrality, allowing the warring parties in Spain to resolve their own national affairs.

Next, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne explained the erection of cannons near Gibraltar, saying that during the early stages of the war, government warships had attacked Algeciras, so the Nationalist forces' erection of cannons today may be to prevent government warships from attacking again. Moreover, the cannons are not sophisticated, so there is nothing to fear. The external reports that the Nationalist forces erected 12-inch caliber cannons there are also not true, as Britain's cannons in Gibraltar are superior. However, the government should reserve the right to negotiate on this matter in the future. These cannons can indeed fire across the Strait, but there is no military threat.

Eden then presented some information on the surveillance plan, saying that the plan proposed by Britain is a balanced approach as a whole. If one part is destroyed, the whole will collapse. After the plan is destroyed, the only path is to completely open the Spanish border, and all countries will compete to transport military supplies into Spain. Therefore, no matter how diverse their opinions or how different their tendencies are, they should not hope for the plan to be destroyed when the surveillance work begins tomorrow. Eden further stated that the Mediterranean is Britain's most important artery, but its position is very broad, and it is not impossible to accommodate others. Therefore, Britain has no intention of monopolizing it, and Britain has always adhered to the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Agreement, and has never had any intention of aggression or hostility towards other countries, because the British do not advocate mutual animosity. Britain's attitude towards the Mediterranean is the same as its attitude towards the Red Sea.

Eden generally discussed international economic issues, stating that removing trade barriers is the most effective way to eliminate political tensions. The currency declaration between Britain, the United States, and France also has this intention. The trade agreement between Britain and the United States is in its preliminary discussions and will definitely benefit global economic cooperation in the future. Furthermore, an international investigation into the fair allocation of raw materials is underway. Britain is willing to actively cooperate in other areas besides tariff policy restrictions in order to eliminate the economic causes of international conflicts. Eden further stated that the League of Nations is not dead, nor is it on the verge of death. Although its strength is limited, it already has considerable influence in political matters, as can be seen from the containment of the dispute between France and Italy. Today, the biggest obstacle to the League's recovery is the division of countries into two major factions: one standing within the walls of the League of Nations and the other standing outside. It must be known that Geneva is a large place and can accommodate all countries in the world, regardless of their political differences or different political systems, as long as they have the desire to cooperate and maintain world peace. He continued, the German and Russian governments' joining the naval agreement is truly visionary. Furthermore, no one should misunderstand the increasing friendship between Britain and France. Looking at the overall situation, it is still satisfactory. He knows that no one needs war, so the ability of European countries to work together to eliminate opinions is better than it was a year ago. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 19th)

The meeting adjourned at 4:00 pm. Well-informed sources claim that during the committee meeting, the representative of a certain country proposed to amend this part. British sources said that the main points of this proposal will not be changed as a result. The most important part of this proposal is the order of implementation of the two methods for withdrawing volunteers from various countries and recognizing belligerent groups. Once the sub-committee submits it for discussion, another fierce debate will ensue. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)

### Radio Inventor Marconi Passed Away Yesterday

Dedicated to Scientific Research in His Youth; Invented Many Practical Radios

[Rome] Famous Italian radio inventor Marquis Marconi passed away today at the age of sixty-three. He was born in Bologna and was most interested in physics at an early age. At the age of twenty, after reading the experimental report of Professor Hertz, the inventor of X-rays, he immersed himself in the study of electricity. In 1895, he tested the wireless transmission of Morse code for two miles in Pontecchio, realizing the importance of this invention. He immediately returned to England and told Sir Preece, the chief engineer of the British Post Office, who greatly appreciated it. As a result, Marconi became a world-renowned genius scientist at the age of twenty-two. At that time, various European countries competed to invite him. In 1899, he installed the first radio station in the Kiel Canal. In 1900, he invented the principle of broadcasting news using long and short waves. In 1901, he began to install a transatlantic radio station. The following year, he installed radio equipment on the American mail ship "Lucania". When the ship crossed the Atlantic, it was able to communicate with New York and London at all times. Since then, radio science has changed rapidly. By 1906, radio stations began broadcasting music programs, and radiotelephones first appeared in Italy in 1914. After the European War, Marconi once entered politics and attended the Treaty of Versailles conference in 1918 as an Italian representative. However, a year later, he returned to the study of radio science, especially emphasizing the practicality of shortwave radio. He made many inventions in the past ten years, and his contribution to the world's shipping, commerce, politics, and journalism is unparalleled. In recent years, his most focused research has been the ultra-shortwave radio used for radio image transmission. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1919. In addition to scientific research, he also enjoyed traveling. He is currently the director of the Italian Academy of Sciences, a member of the Senate, and a member of the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party. After the outbreak of the Abyssinian War two years ago, he offered to go to East Africa to serve. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)

⊙Rome: The "creator of modern radio" in Italy, Marconi, died of heart disease at 3:30 this morning at the age of 63. Marconi was not the inventor of radio, as the first to invent radio was the German Hertz, but the modern world's ability to practically use radio is due to Marconi's tireless research on radio.

Marconi was born on April 25, 1874. His father was Italian, and his mother was Irish. When Marconi grew up, his father initially wanted him to study music, but Marconi refused and devoted himself to the study of radio. His father tried to stop him and even wanted to destroy the equipment he used for research, but finally, with the mediation of his mother, his father reluctantly agreed to his wishes and no longer interfered.

At the age of twenty-one, his first experiment was successful, and Hertz's radio waves proved its effectiveness. At that time, Italy did not believe it, but his mother was deeply convinced. She took him to London and, with the help of her family, obtained registration with the British government, becoming the founder of practical radio. This was in 1896, when Marconi was only twenty-two years old.

In 1901, radio transmission was a great success, able to transmit messages between Cornwall and the Isle of Wight, 183 miles apart. A few months later, Marconi's radio crossed the Atlantic, communicating between Cornwall and Newfoundland. The world was amazed, and the scientific community, governments, and newspapers of various countries celebrated its success. Ships began to install radio equipment, and countless ships in distress at sea sent out distress signals through the airwaves and were rescued. In 1913, when the American giant ship "Titanic" was sunk by a German submarine, more than 1,000 people were rescued. When they arrived in New York, Marconi was also in the city. These rescued people walked in formation to Marconi's residence and shouted three times to Marconi as their savior.

In 1909, Marconi received the Nobel Prize in Physics. During the European War, Marconi's radios were used by the British and Italian governments for communication with naval bases and ships at sea, with great success.

In 1914, Marconi was awarded the title of nobility by the Italian government, took up the position of Senator, and became a free citizen of Rome. After the end of the European War, Marconi was ordered to participate in the Paris Peace Conference as one of the Italian representatives. After the establishment of the treaty, Marconi devoted himself to the research of radio again, and various new inventions appeared one after another, such as the "long-distance one-way radio" in 1923 and the success of ultra-shortwave transmission in 1931, which were famous in the scientific community.

Although Marconi was a great scientist, he did not have the inevitable quirks and behaviors of other scientists. Marconi was elegant and self-appreciating, and liked to dress well, with the demeanor of a Confucian scholar. Marconi was not tall, but his forehead was high, his nose was prominent, and his appearance was quite dignified, making him admirable. He spoke English fluently, was good at French, and liked riding, shooting, and hunting. Marconi married twice in his life. His first wife was Irish and had one son and two daughters. They later divorced. His current wife is Italian. Marconi firmly believed that radio could be used for interstellar communication in the future and that there were living beings and humans on planets other than Earth, and that the power of radio could transcend the atmosphere and reach other celestial bodies.

### Germany Incentivizes Childbirth

Working Women Receive Dowry Upon Marriage

[Berlin] Since August 1933, women who serve society in Germany can receive a dowry of 600 marks from the government when they get married, without interest, but must withdraw from the labor force as a condition. As of the end of last year, more than 750,000 women have accepted this dowry and married, giving birth to nearly 300,000 children. According to statistics published by the National Bureau of Statistics, women who married and received a dowry in 1933 and 1934 gave birth to 78% more daughters than the general population.

### Zhang Qingyu's Unit of the Puppet "East Hebei" Security Force Eliminated

Zhang Executed by Traitor Yin; Extreme Chaos in Tong County

Tianjin correspondence: The First Brigade of the "East Hebei" puppet organization's security force, stationed in Tong County, with a force of 1,500 men, was originally reorganized from the former subordinates of Ma Tingfu, a brigade commander under Yu Xuezhong. It was considered one of the more elite units in the puppet security force. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese army stationed in Tong County suddenly indicated that Zhang Qingyu, the commander of the First Brigade, was plotting to lead his troops to revolt and return to the national government. They immediately placed Zhang under surveillance. Later, the Japanese army still felt that Zhang was unstable and ordered Zhang to lead his troops out of Tong County on the morning of the 16th, to be stationed in Daliqiao, a suburb of Tong County, and to build defensive fortifications against the 29th Army in the Pingxi area. Zhang knew something was amiss and was afraid of being eliminated by the Japanese army by taking advantage of the situation. Therefore, starting at noon that day, he refused to obey orders and acted on his own. The part of the First Brigade stationed in Tong County city clashed with the Japanese army at 6:00 pm that day, entering a state of chaos that night. Zhang himself was lured to the puppet government by the traitor Yin on the same day under the guise of negotiating terms and was placed under guard. He was then sent to the Japanese special service agency stationed in Tong County. It is rumored that Yin, under the orders of the Japanese, executed Zhang Qingyu on the 17th. The part of the puppet security force outside Tong County city was surrounded and disarmed by the Japanese army before it could mutiny. However, the mutinous troops in the city are still resisting in the streets, and the situation has not been completely resolved as of the morning of the 18th, so the city is still in a state of chaos. All four gates of Tong County are tightly closed, and the people cannot escape. The casualties and losses of the military and civilians are not yet known in detail. It is said that in addition to Zhang Qingyu, the units of Zhang Yantian and Li Haitian of the "East Hebei" puppet security force were also former subordinates of Ma Tingfu. At the beginning of Yin's rebellion, it was a temporary compromise. Although Yin held the position of chief of the puppet government, he had no authority to command the influential leaders such as Zhang Yantian, Li Haitian, and Zhang Qingyu. However, Yin always used his flattery to the Japanese side, so he often relied on the power of the Japanese to suppress influential leaders. The officers and soldiers of the puppet security force had long expressed dissatisfaction with Yin, but they were afraid of the Japanese side and could not act. And when Yin compiled the puppet security supplementary general team and appointed his confidant Li Baozhang as the team leader, Zhang and Li and other traitors hated him even more. Therefore, internal strife in "East Hebei" was about to erupt. Zhang Qingyu's execution and the elimination of his subordinates have made the other puppet security teams feel a sense of shared peril. The Japanese side had already foreseen this, so it has strengthened its suppression of Tang, Yu, Feng, Luo, and other places to prevent mutiny. The fate of the traitors can be seen. (18th)

### Recent Situation in Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou

Xiamen: Gambling Dens Suddenly Revive; Quanzhou and Zhangzhou: Coastal Areas Implement Strict Baojia System

Xiamen Dispatch: Following the Lugouqiao Incident, Commander Ohkuma of the Japanese 5th Torpedo Squadron stationed in Taiwan immediately led the cruiser Yubari and the destroyer Asagao to Xiamen on the 9th, claiming to be on a cruise and having no specific mission. On the 12th, the Asagao sailed to Fuzhou, while the Yubari remained in Xiamen. However, Japan has always regarded Xiamen and Fuzhou as its own naval ports, coming and going freely. Usually, more than ten or five or six ships would arrive in a group, staying for several days before leaving. It was common for two or three ships to stay in port. Therefore, the people of Fuzhou and Xiamen had long ceased to be surprised by the arrival of Japanese warships. However, after the Lugouqiao Incident, the gambling dens of a certain nationality, which had been banned in Xiamen for several years, suddenly revived within a few days. Gambling was openly conducted in places like Siming South Road, Chenguang Road, and Jukou Street, with the entrances of the gambling dens crowded like markets, operating all night long. This is particularly noteworthy. In the southern Fujian area, the coastal area of Jinjiang County's Jinan Third District, outside the south gate of Quanzhou, has always been an important military location for the coastal defense of Fujian Province, separated from Taiwan by only a narrow strip of water. It has long been an area where people of a certain nationality mixed. Recently, doctors, water carriers, and prostitutes from a certain country have suddenly increased significantly and are very active. The Third District Office has implemented strict Baojia organization, forming a strong men's investigation team and a communication team, numbering hundreds of people, divided into two investigation teams and one communication team. Members are selected from the Lianbao (joint guarantee) and are filled with trained instructors from the strong men's training class. On the 12th, the District Office convened a joint district meeting of the Lianbao directors and Baojia chiefs, resolving the following: (1) Organize a strong men's base team, to be established before the 30th of this month. (2) Organize a strong men's communication team. (3) Vigorously implement a general mobilization throughout the district, conduct a household census through an investigation team. (4) Complete the telephone network throughout the district to prevent the activities of ruffians. Furthermore, Huian County in Quanzhou is also separated from Taiwan by only a narrow strip of water, with Chongwu being particularly close to Taiwan, holding a similar position to Jinan. It has also long been a place where unscrupulous merchants collude with ruffians to conduct smuggling. Recently, rumors have been rampant, so the second district chief, Chen Guoliang, specially convened a meeting of the Bao chiefs of Chongwu, Xiaozha, and Daku and other coastal areas, resolving the following: (1) Each Lianbao will set up a messenger sentry to transmit news and communicate information. (2) Starting immediately, each Bao group will establish a patrol team to investigate and arrest traitors. In addition, in Dongshan County in Zhangzhou, warships of a certain country often arrive, and at the same time, ruffians collude with unscrupulous merchants to smuggle and sell counterfeit currency in the county. On the morning of the 14th of this month, two cruisers from a certain country suddenly arrived, slowly entering and surveying the Dongshan port for more than an hour before leaving. The water police and the county government, upon receiving the report, ordered the coastal areas to pay attention to the movements of foreign ships. Dongshan, geographically linking Fujian, Guangdong, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, is a militarily important location for naval warfare and has long been the focus of attention of a certain country.

On the 12th and 13th, it was widely rumored here that Japanese residents and citizens in Xiamen had been ordered to evacuate. Later, it was verified that this was not the case. On the 16th, Takahashi Shigeru, the acting Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, answered questions from a certain newspaper reporter, denying the evacuation of Japanese residents, saying that he had not received such instructions. The reporter also asked, "If, unfortunately, a large-scale war breaks out between China and Japan in southern Fujian, the Japanese residents can take the ships back to their country at any time, but what about the citizens of your country?" Takahashi replied, "Protecting residents and citizens is both our responsibility. There are also specific plans for the wartime protection of residents." It is noted that Xiamen has a population of 180,000, and there are nearly 20,000 Taiwanese Japanese citizens, accounting for one-tenth. Many of them have been engaged in their businesses for generations and own real estate. In terms of personnel and economy, it is not easy to evacuate them immediately, unlike the Japanese residents in Xiamen, who number only two or three hundred.

### Chen Lianbo's Arrest Warrant Revoked

Hong Kong Dispatch: Mr. Chen Lianbo, former general manager of Nanyang Tobacco Co., Ltd., was sued by Wang Songxian for an account issue. Mr. Chen did not appear in court, resulting in an arrest warrant being issued. The other day, Wang Songxian hired a lawyer and requested the revocation of the arrest warrant at the Hong Kong Magistracy. Lawyer Luo Wenjin represented the late Mr. Chen and was present in court for a hearing. At the opening of the court, Wang's lawyer, Davidson, stood up and stated the reasons for requesting the revocation of the arrest warrant, saying that in June 1934, Wang had provided some materials to the court, causing the government to order the police to arrest Chen. On June 6th of that year, Chen was summoned to court for questioning. At that time, the case was adjourned for a week. When it was brought up again, Chen did not appear, and the court confiscated his bail according to the law. Wang was one of the shareholders who owned the most shares in the company at that time. He felt that many things should not have happened for the sake of the interests of the company, so the arrest warrant was issued. Since then, Wang has had nothing to do with the company and has severed relations with the case. He is now an ordinary person and does not want to bring up the old story. Wang also believes that even if Chen is guilty of a certain event, it is not a criminal offense. Wang has also accepted lawyer Luo Wenjin's explanation of the circumstances under which Chen was accused at that time, believing that if Luo's lawyer's statement is true, Chen has a good defense. The reason why Wang and Chen were unable to return to Hong Kong was due to him blocking them. Now Wang knows that this matter is completely out of his control and is managed by the court. However, in his opinion, if Wang does not file a lawsuit, the police will not continue to execute it. Then, the police commissioner stated that this matter happened because someone made an oath to the court and the lawyer testified. The police are just doing things according to the law. Now that there is this explanation, he will not object to the revocation of the arrest warrant. Then, lawyer Luo Wenjin stood up and said that the court had heard what Dai and Liang had said, and believed that the arrest warrant had been revoked. He now represents Chen, believing that this revocation of the arrest warrant is not without reason. The plaintiff's request should be granted. After listening to Shi Si's words, he approved the case and said that if the defendant had appeared in court on the day of the hearing and the plaintiff had no sufficient evidence to present, the charges would naturally not be established.

### Progress of the Jinggan Railway

Laying Track in Three Phases; Working Day and Night and Building the Guimei Line

Tunxi Dispatch: Since the start of construction, the Xuan Gui section of the Jinggan Railway has progressed rapidly. The southern section passes through the mountainous area of Huangshan and advances simultaneously from Guixi in Jiangxi Province. The roadbed bridges have been largely constructed. The earthwork engineering of the Anhui section from Sunjiabu to Zhengzhou is also nearing completion. Bridges and culverts are being rushed. The Engineering Bureau has stipulated that the track laying project will be carried out in three phases. The first phase, starting from Sunjiabu to Qiaotoupu, has already begun on the 1st of this month. The second phase starts from Qiaotoupu to Wan'an in Xiuning. The third phase starts from Wan'an to Qimen. It is planned to complete all three phases by the end of the year. In order to facilitate the transportation of materials, the bureau has also set up a material factory in Wuhu and built a branch line connecting the Jiangnan Railway. Thirty freight cars have been purchased from Shanghai so that the materials transported by land and water can be transported from the Jiangnan Road to Sunjiabu for use. The project south of Sunjiabu is divided into two major parts, Anhui and Jiangxi. The Anhui section is divided into Xuan (cheng) • Ning (guo) • Ningji (xi) • Jixi (Huizhou) • Xixiu (ning) • Xiuqi (men) • five general sections, with nearly 20,000 workers. The Jiangxi section is divided into Fu (liang) Le (ping) • Le Wan (nian) • Gui (xi) and other sections, with also over 10,000 workers. They are now working day and night in different sections. The poles and lines for telephones and telegrams along the line have been erected and communication has begun to facilitate communication and coordination of the project. It is expected that the entire line will be completed in March next year. After this section is open to traffic, the existing engineering personnel and road workers will continue to advance south to build the route from Guixi to Meixian in Guangdong, connecting with the planned Guangmei Line and the planned Zhang (shu) Mei branch line of the Zhejgan Line, completing the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and direct traffic. In addition, the Nanjing-Xuancheng section is operated by the Jiangnan Company. The Ministry of Railways is currently negotiating with the company to take it over as a state-owned enterprise. If the price is too high to reach an agreement, it is said that a railway will be built from Nanjing to Sunjiabu, abandoning Wuhu and Xuancheng (July 14).

### Miscellaneous Writings on Rural Hubei

— Cheng Jun

Passing through Tuanfeng to Huanggang

In the morning light of June 1st, I set off from Hankou on an inland river steamer belonging to the Construction Department to eastern Hubei. After traveling sixty li to Yangluo, I entered Huanggang and then arrived at Tuanfeng via Cangzibu, a total distance of one hundred and thirty li. This shipping line was originally run by merchants, who, in their pursuit of profit, often overloaded the ships, leading to accidents. The Construction Department then took it back and managed it, limiting the number of passengers and goods. Unexpectedly, after two years of reorganization, it was still not perfect. Tickets were sold in large quantities, so when boarding the ship, people were crowded and the order was extremely chaotic. Later arrivals found no place to stand, while "fellow villagers" in military uniforms often did not buy tickets and brought others with them, leaving the ticket inspectors helpless. A woman was squeezed to stand on the side of the ship and asked the ticket inspector, "I paid for a ticket, why is there no seat?" The ticket inspector glared at her and replied sharply, "Who told you to come late?" as if he wanted to vent the anger he had suffered earlier on the woman, leaving her helpless.

Tuanfeng is located on the banks of the Yangtze River, with rows of houses and a history of prosperous commerce. The county of Huanggang produces local cloth, tobacco, and cotton, all of which are gathered and distributed here. The county seat was once moved here, demonstrating the importance of its location. Its specialty is local cloth, which is sold to neighboring counties and even as far as Wuhan. At its peak, sales reached more than 200,000 bolts. It is purely handmade, and the rural economy relies on it to a considerable extent. After the great flood of 1931, the situation changed, sales became sluggish, and foreign goods took the opportunity to invade. There is a cloth industry association in the area, and when I inquired about the quantity and value of production over the years, the person in charge seemed unable to answer. It seems that the rise and fall of local cloth is related to the prosperity or decline of the market, and they did not want to reveal the true news to others. In Tuanfeng's hotels, people came and went, whispering to each other, with worried and frightened expressions between their brows. I asked the innkeeper, who said that there had been a large group of bandits fighting with government troops near here recently, and the sound of gunfire had not stopped all night. It was heard that the bandits had retreated not far away and were afraid of their return, so they were still living in fear.

On the 2nd, I left Tuanfeng and traveled sixty li to reach the county seat of Huanggang. Huanggang was once the State of Xianzi during the Zhou Dynasty, which was later merged into Chu and called Zhucheng. The name of the county changed several times throughout history, and it was not until the Sui Dynasty that it was named Huanggang. From the Tang and Song dynasties to the Qing Dynasty, it was the seat of the prefecture government, known as Qian and Huangzhou. After the Republic of China, it was changed to a county, with a population of over 800,000 and a land area of more than 27,000 square li. The northeast is mountainous, with rugged roads, while the southwest is a plain, with the flow of the Ba River and the Yangtze River, making transportation very convenient. The county seat is located on the banks of the Yangtze River, controlling eastern Hubei and Wuhan Jiujiang, forming a mutual support, and the situation is very important. The Administrative Commissioner's Office of the Second District has moved here from Qichun.

The county is large and rich in resources, and it is also close to Wuhan, so culture was introduced early. The people are enterprising. During the imperial examination era of the Qing Dynasty, it produced the most talent. After the Republic of China, it became a county with "many officials," comparable to Liling in Hunan and Gangzi in Guizhou. The most famous are Xiao Yaonan, the former governor of Hubei and provincial governor, Fang Benren, the director of Jiangxi, Xu Yuanquan, the director of the Sichuan-Hubei-Hunan-Guizhou border region, Wan Yaohuang, the commander of the 13th Division, and Zhu Huaibing, the commander of the 94th Division, all of whom are natives of Huanggang. There are many others serving in the military and political circles. A man from Huanggang proudly told the reporter that all agencies in Wuhan have people from Huanggang participating. If there are no people from Huanggang, then the agency cannot be considered an agency. Examining the facts, it is not an exaggeration. The customs of the people vary inversely between the riverside and the inner mountains. The riverside people are cunning and used to extravagance, while the inner mountain people eat food and drink well water, and are simple and honest. The concept of region and family is extremely deep. Clan leaders use this psychology to cultivate special forces, exploiting the villagers and holding up the government, doing whatever they want. As a result, the gentry have extremely high power, and the government has to depend on them. There are so-called "big kings" and "four diamond kings" among the bad gentry, whose power can be imagined.

About two li from the city, there is the Red Cliff, and all travelers to this place visit it. This place was originally called Red Nose Isle. It is not the same place as the Red Cliff where Sun Quan and Cao Cao fought. Since Su Shi wrote the Rhapsody on the Red Cliff, this place has become famous, while the true Red Cliff in Jiayu has been buried and is no longer prominent. It can be seen that 830,000 troops are no match for a literati's pen. However, the mountains and rivers in this place are beautiful and suitable for sightseeing. There are pavilions and towers facing each other, such as the Erfu Hall and the Fanghe Pavilion, which are very elegant. There are countless famous calligraphy and paintings engraved on stone tablets. There are also antiques such as the eight-tone fish, which makes eight different sounds when tapped. It is rock-like in texture and engraved with poems and prose. When Chairman Jiang visited this place, he instructed the manager to prevent people from stealing and selling it, so ordinary people cannot easily see it. There are small stones with flower patterns produced under the isle, which are very exquisite, even more so than those produced in Yuhua Terrace in Nanjing. There is a pagoda in the east of the city, facing the Red Cliff, made of huge blue stones, and the architecture is very magnificent, but unfortunately I did not climb it to see the ships coming and going and hear the sad cries of the fish and dragons.

### Songjiang

Incest Case Scheduled for Continued Hearing

The incest case of Zhang Shigu, who killed his father outside the North Gate of this county, has been prosecuted by the District Procuratorate and heard by the Criminal Court. Judge Wang Ruyi is presiding over the hearing. Zhang Shigu firmly denied the charges and made a counter-confession. It is learned that the District Court has summoned Zhang Baoding, Tang Shuqin, Xu Aitang, and others to continue the hearing at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th.

Russian Youth Detained at the Station

At Xinqiao Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, three Russian youths were seen walking through the station from Shanghai on the morning of the 19th, carrying a package. The platoon leader of the stationed military police saw them and, suspecting their appearance, followed them. When they reached the Mingxing Bridge Station in this city, the Russians, seeing the situation was not good, turned back the way they had come. When they reached Xinqiao Station, the platoon leader, together with the stationmaster and the local Bao chief, strictly questioned them. However, the Russians did not understand Chinese and their words were vague. When their package was inspected, it contained 21 yuan in foreign currency, a six-inch revolver, 65 bullets, a telescope, and a war map. That night, they were detained by the military police at the new station. On the morning of the 20th, they were escorted to the county's military police department for a preliminary interrogation and then escorted to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters for verification.

### Suzhou

Japanese Consul Requests Protection of Residents

With the North China Incident becoming increasingly serious, Japanese residents in Suzhou are preparing to return to their country. The Japanese Consul in Suzhou, Ichikawa Shuzo, visited County Chief Deng at the county government at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th. As County Chief Deng was out on official business, he was received by Secretary Huang Kejia of the Foreign Affairs Department. Consul Ichikawa requested the county government to provide special protection to the Japanese residents in Suzhou. Secretary Huang of the Foreign Affairs Department expressed his acceptance of the Japanese Consul's request. The consul then left. A suspicious merchant ship of a certain country, which was seized by the police department between Huguan and Wangting the other day, was escorted out of the country on the 20th.

Zhang's Society Sends Telegram to Song

The Zhang's National Studies Lecture Society sent a telegram to Song Zheyuan's 29th Army, which stated: "To Chairman Song of Peiping and the soldiers of the 29th Army. The Ronglu are greedy and insatiable, and the frontiers are limited. Liaodong has been sullied with the smell of livestock, and Hebei is troubled by planning. We believe that our 29th Army shares the same loyalty and indignation, and has always been known for its power. Now, facing the brunt of a strong enemy, we are even more capable of defeating the near capital. We hope that your tiger steps will be more comfortable and your fierce leap will be farther, that you will completely annihilate the fierce enemy and report the deep hatred. We, the colleagues, look forward to your departure from afar, and we only think of throwing away our pens. We humbly donate a meal to pay the three armies, and the money is paid by mail and telegraph. Zhang's National Studies Lecture Society." Song Zheyuan replied by telegram: "To the Zhang's National Studies Lecture Society. I have respectfully received your telegram. It is our duty to defend the land. I am ashamed and grateful for your praise and donation. I am sending this telegram to thank you. Song Zheyuan."

### Hangzhou

Sharp Decrease in Passenger Traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway

Due to the serious impact of the North China situation and the scorching weather, there has been a sharp decrease in passenger traffic between Shanghai and Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. It is estimated that passenger trains run four times a day between Shanghai and Hangzhou, with only about 200 passengers on each trip, a decrease of about half compared to before. Therefore, the revenue from passenger and freight fares has also decreased sharply.

Establishment of a Flow Measurement Station

The Jiangsu Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau believes that the Huaihe and Yunhe rivers are closely related. As the flood season is approaching, it is necessary to send personnel to measure and report the water level and flow of the Huaihe River on a daily basis. Therefore, the bureau has sent technician Tan Erchang and engineer Chen Yongnian to Bengbu to establish the Bengbu Flow Measurement Station. Measurement work will begin immediately, and daily reports will be sent to the Canal Engineering Bureau and the Water Conservancy Department of the National Economic Commission as a reference for flood prevention. It is said that the station will be closed at the end of October after the flood season has passed.

### Mingguang

Rui'an Steamer Encountered Bandits En Route

The Rui'an steamer on the Wu-Wu line was traveling from Wu to Wu on the 17th when it reached the Taipinggou area. Suddenly, a bandit ship, which had stopped there in advance, containing several bandits, fired shots to threaten the steamer and ordered it to stop. The driver, realizing the situation was not good, sped away. The bandits also raised their sails and chased after it, but they were ultimately outmatched in speed, and the steamer managed to escape. However, the passengers were greatly frightened.

### Zhengzhou

Prison Break in Minquan County

According to visitors from Minquan County, three prison break incidents have occurred in the county's prison this month. Apart from those caught on the spot, seven bandits have escaped one after another. In the first prison break, bandits Wu Xiangzhe and others escaped from the prison wall by climbing over the roof of their prison cage. Afterward, the authorities pursued them, but it was difficult to capture them during the green gauze curtain, so they closed the city and searched the case, and captured only Wu Xiangting and two others that night, while the rest escaped without a trace. The second incident involved a bandit named Song Wu digging a hole under his cage and escaping from the prison cell, climbing over the wall and jumping out. The guard on duty saw him and fired several shots but missed. The police team was dispatched and gunshots were fired everywhere. The county chief, awakened from his dream, also went shirtless and held a gun, personally leading the police to pursue him, but he was ultimately escaped. The third incident involved several bandits and drug offenders trying to escape over the wall. Fortunately, they were discovered by the guards on the roof of the prison, who opened fire. The escapees were frightened and all retreated, so they did not escape.

### Kita Returns to Shanghai

Summoning Naval and Army Personnel from Outside, Reporting on the Journey to Beijing

Kita Seiichi, the army attaché at the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai, arrived in Beijing on the 18th evening. He summoned Otokido Sanji, the army attaché stationed in Beijing, and Hidaka Noburo, the counselor, to hear a report and discuss diplomatic and military actions to be taken in Beijing and Shanghai when necessary. He also paid a visit to He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration, to inquire about the attitude of our military authorities towards the Lugouqiao Incident. Minister He replied, "The current tense situation is entirely caused by the Japanese side dispatching a large number of army and navy personnel. We have no intention of challenging, but for the sake of self-defense, we have to make preparations. At the same time, whether the incident expands or not depends on the Japanese side, not China." Kita considered the situation clear, so he took the overnight express train from Beijing the night before last at 11 PM and arrived here at 7:40 AM yesterday. Okazaki Hideshi, the Japanese Consul in Shanghai, and Tajiri, the intelligence chief, and others went to greet him. After Kita got into the car, he went to his residence to rest. He then met with naval attaché Honda, Hasegawa, the commander of the Third Fleet, and other naval and army personnel from outside to report on the journey to Beijing and discuss concrete future directions. After the meeting, Kita telegraphed all the results to the Army Ministry in his country.

### Public Concession Safe and Sound

The Volunteer Corps Can Mobilize to Maintain Order in a Few Hours

According to the Ta Kung Pao, an executive of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai International Volunteer Corps told a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao that although the Shanghai International Volunteer Corps has not made special preparations, if the Shanghai situation requires the Volunteer Corps to mobilize, it can be done in a few hours. However, it is unwilling to do so unless it is absolutely necessary to maintain the security of the Public Concession. According to Stirling Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, judging from the current situation, it seems unlikely that China and Japan will fight in the Shanghai area for a while. However, the Municipal Council is closely watching the situation. If a serious war occurs, the emotions of the Chinese and Japanese people are likely to become very strong. If it is a minor disturbance, the Municipal Council's police force can handle it. Therefore, the Volunteer Corps is unwilling to mobilize unless it is absolutely necessary. If the war extends to the Shanghai area and the two armies seem to be disturbing the Public Concession, then the troops of various countries stationed in Shanghai and the Volunteer Corps will, as in 1932, jointly assume the responsibility of protection. Fessenden also clearly stated that the Volunteer Corps will never be summoned in advance to avoid hindering business. However, when a reporter asked Lieutenant Colonel Graham, the commander of the Volunteer Corps, whether the district and the Volunteer Corps had made preparations for mobilization, he declined to comment.

### British Embassy Financial Advisor Pa Zhi Visits Song

### The Market Stabilizes and Morale is Boosted After Chairman Chiang's Speech is Released

All Are Willing to Prepare to Sacrifice Under the Leadership of the Central Government. The Ten-Person Group Telegraphs 1,000 Yuan Yesterday to Show Loyalty to the Nation

Since the Central Government released Chairman Chiang's speech in Kuling, stating our country's solemn position and declaring four points of peace, the people's morale has been exceptionally high. People from all walks of life in this city have expressed their determination to prepare to sacrifice for the survival of the nation at the final moment with a solemn and calm spirit under the leadership of the Central Government. Therefore, the situation in this city has stabilized a lot, and the trading market has also stabilized. As for the Westerners, they also expressed deep sympathy for Chairman Chiang's speech, believing that the points stated were solemn in purpose and clear in attitude, and that they were the most practical way to solve the Sino-Japanese problem. They all hoped that the Japanese government would rein in at the precipice, so that the situation in the Far East could be stabilized.

The Chinese National Salvation Ten-Person Group United Association is a group that was established after the May Fourth Movement in 1919 to resist Japan and save the country. In recent years, due to environmental restrictions, there have been few activities, but they have encouraged each other and waited patiently for the time to repay the country.

### All Circles in Shanghai Rise Up to Face the National Crisis Together

The Silk Industry Collects National Defense Donations Starting Yesterday. Maritime Workers Establish an Anti-Japanese Support Association

The prelude to the war has begun. All circles in Shanghai, with the national crisis being serious, consider this the final moment. The soldiers on the front lines are fighting the Japanese in bloody battles, and the people in the rear should accumulate financial resources and enthusiastically contribute. Yesterday, the silk industry collected national defense donations and the engine crew donated salary to comfort the troops, which was very enthusiastic. The details are recorded as follows:

### Silk Industry Collects National Defense Donations

The Shanghai Silk Industry Association sent a letter to all members yesterday, saying: Dear Sirs, Case Investigation, the second resolution of the seventh members' meeting on February 21, 1936, proposed that each shop should contribute a certain amount based on its turnover to assist the soldiers fighting against Japan. The detailed method was handed over to the executive committee to formulate. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the news of the war was sometimes relaxed and sometimes tense. The national crisis is serious and has reached the final moment. The soldiers on the front lines are fighting the Japanese in bloody battles, and the people in the rear should accumulate financial resources and enthusiastically contribute to encourage the soldiers. Therefore, the 14th executive committee meeting on July 15 of this year, based on the resolution of the previous general meeting, proposed to discuss the method of donating money to resist Japan. It was decided to name it the National Defense Donation. Starting from the 20th of this month, each piece of real silk goods will be charged an additional 5 cents, each piece of interwoven goods will be charged an additional 1 cent, and each piece of foreign silk will be charged an additional 2 cents. Notify the members and inform the inspection association to handle it together when the time comes. In addition to sending a separate letter, this letter is urgently delivered, and you are requested to check and comply.

Engine Crew Donates Salary Increase

The China Engine Crew Union yesterday notified all engine crew members to donate one month's salary increase to comfort the soldiers fighting against Japan on the front lines. The original letter said: Dear Sirs, According to letters from all engine crew members of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili, Jianghua, Taishun, Kuaili, and Sanbei Company's Ningxing, Longxing, Songshan, and other ships, since the Lugouqiao Incident, people from all over the country have been raising donations or donating salaries to purchase comforting items and organizing assistance associations to support each other. Our engine crew members should not be inferior to others in loving the country. A suggestion was specially made, stating that after the entire engine crew of each ship made a request for each ship to increase their treatment, the Ministry of Communications authorities approved it, and it will be announced soon. Since Lugouqiao, thanks to our loyal and brave 29th Army fighting against the enemy in bloody battles, willing to fill the tomb with defending the territory, their loyalty and courage can touch the clouds. All compatriots in the country are excited and indignant. The rear assistance is imminent as the war is getting worse day by day. We are willing to donate all of this month's salary increase to comfort the front lines, and we ask all engine crew members to act together. This suggestion deeply expresses the patriotic enthusiasm of our engine crew members, and it should be unanimously approved. We hope that all members will enthusiastically donate to gather a large amount of money to send to the front lines to comfort the soldiers and boost morale.

Accountants Send Telegrams of Condolence

Chairman Wei of Beiping, Chairman Ma, Mayor Qin, and all the generals of the 29th Army: The Lugouqiao Incident has once again relied on the local Sui soldiers to calmly resist and defend, and the whole country is deeply grateful and the morale is high. We are even more united against the enemy. We also hope that you will encourage the soldiers who are sleeping on their weapons to strive for the survival of our nation and the importance of the survival of the country.

### Qingdao and Tianjin National Ships Suspend Sailing

Passengers Avoiding the Heat All Return to Shanghai

Tianjin National Ships Suspend Sailing

After the Tanggu Wharf and the newly built cargo warehouse of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were forcibly occupied by the Japanese army on the 19th, the goods and cargo stored in the warehouse, worth more than 1.5 million yuan, can no longer be loaded and unloaded. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tianjin ships have no place to berth. Yesterday, the company officially announced that all North Ocean liners, starting from today's departure of the Xinfeng ship, will suspend sailing to Tianjin and only go to Yantai and Weihaiwei. All the goods that had been loaded for Tianjin on the previous two days were also returned yesterday.

Qingdao Decides to Stop Sailing

In recent years, every summer, Shanghai passengers going to Qingdao have been very crowded. Eight or nine out of ten are going to the Jiaozhou Bay area to escape the summer heat. Each shipping company has been adding special Shanghai-Qingdao ships since June. The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially opened the Nanhua Sanxin ship on the Shanghai-Qingdao special route from the 9th of this month. Now that the second ship has just been opened, the Lugouqiao Incident has occurred, and Qingdao has suddenly become tense. The company also decided yesterday to officially announce the suspension of the Shanghai-Qingdao route from today.

Heat-Avoiding Passengers All Return

In the past half month, Shanghai passengers going to Qingdao to escape the summer heat have been coming and going. On this trip of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haizhen ship to Qingdao, all the dining rooms and first and second-class cabins were full. However, when this Haizhen ship arrived in Qingdao, these heat-avoiding passengers who had arrived had all moved away a few days ago. Qingdao, a summer resort, has become unusually deserted within a week. Therefore, all the heat-avoiding passengers on the Haizhen ship dared not go ashore when they arrived in Qingdao and immediately requested Captain Hu Xiyuan to return to Shanghai on the original ship. Not a single person went ashore. Yesterday, the Haizhen ship returned to Shanghai, and the passengers who went on the original ship to avoid the heat did not lose a single person and still took the original ship back to Shanghai. According to the passengers, the market in Qingdao is very desolate, but the people seem to be still stable.

### Japanese Nationals Evacuated from the Taiyuan Area Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday to Return to Their Country

The Second Batch Will Also Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

Since the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally instructed Japanese nationals residing in the Taiyuan area to evacuate, it is now known that a group of about 20 Japanese women and children have taken the Pinghan Road to Wuhan and transferred to the Japanese ship Fengyang Maru to Shanghai. They arrived here yesterday and stayed at hotels such as the Tokiwa-kan and Hinode-kan on Haining Road. According to reporters, the Japanese nationals took the Nagasaki Maru back to Japan at 9 AM yesterday. Those who did not arrive in Shanghai in time are also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and will take the Shanghai Maru back to Japan on the 23rd. Therefore, the ships sailing to Japan these days have been fully booked by Japanese nationals.

### Food Preparation Issues During Extraordinary Times

Soybean and Rice Industries Hold a Joint Meeting. Dalian and Andong Absolutely Prohibited from Loading and Shipping

The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association and the Oil Cake and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at the Cuixiu Hall in the Old City God Temple at 3 PM yesterday to discuss food preparation issues during extraordinary times. Gu Xinyi chaired the meeting, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. There were also important resolutions. The details are recorded as follows:

Convening a Joint Meeting of Two Industries

The association, in view of the increasingly tense situation and the extreme importance of food during this extraordinary period, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially convened Gu Xinyi, a leader in the food industry, to discuss everything. In order to ensure practical progress, Gu and others convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association and the Oil Cake and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association at the Cuixiu Hall at 3 PM yesterday.

Sufficient Grain Reserves Ensure People's Food Supply

According to the association's report, the Shanghai grain market is currently very abundant. There are currently about 130,000 bags of Ke Xin rice and about 160,000 dan of He Xia rice, totaling about 300,000 dan. More than 1 million bags of wheat have been ordered from various producing areas, and more than 1.5 million bags are stored in various factories. There are more than 800,000 bags of flour stored. Therefore, it is enough to provide food for the city for several months. In addition to the stored rice and wheat, there are still continuous shipments from the mainland to Shanghai, and the new rice will soon be on the market. The water supply has been even this year, and the harvest is sure to be good. Therefore, in the future, there will be no panic about the people's food supply.

Liaison and Cooperation to Deal with the Incident

The meeting discussed that if the incident expands, all grain merchants in the city should follow the government's will to prevent panic about food. Therefore, preparations for food during extraordinary times began last month. Decisions were made on how grain merchants should seek practical liaison and cooperation and how to facilitate transportation and sales. Starting today, the transportation of grain along the Yangtze River should no longer be entrusted to a certain Fang Han ship to prevent accidents.

Strictly Abide by Association Regulations to Prevent Aiding the Enemy

One of the most tense scenes in the meeting was preventing grain from aiding the enemy. The opinions were summarized that domestic transportation should be facilitated so that areas lacking rice and grain can be supplied at any time. However, all transactions should be carried out with caution and must have proof from official agencies or groups. Loading and shipping should be absolutely prohibited to places such as Dalian, Andong, Yingkou, and Qinhuangdao. All grain merchants in the city should strictly abide by the association's regulations and should not be greedy for petty profits. They should also strictly check for unscrupulous elements transporting grain to aid the enemy.

Organize a Commission for Investigating Arrival and Sales

The meeting also decided to organize a commission for investigating the arrival and sales of grain and appointed Chen Shide, Jiang Hongbin, Cai Yukun, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Chen Ziyi, Wang Tianchou, Zhou Zhizhen, Yu Bingwen, He Xianggu, Fu Qiangeng, Feng Yongsheng, and Zhu Xiangsheng, and designated Chen Ziyi as the convener to investigate the situation of grain in the city at any time.

### Foreign Marine Insurance Companies Decide to Double War Risk Premiums

According to the Shanghai Times, the Shanghai Foreign Marine Insurance Association, in view of the unpredictable changes in the situation in North China, convened a special meeting on Monday to discuss and amend the war risk premium method. It was decided that starting today, the war risk premiums for goods carried by foreign ships to and from coastal ports, the Yangtze River, and Hong Kong will be doubled, and will be increased or decreased at any time according to changes in the situation. Piracy insurance is not included in war risk insurance. The association also decided that insurance premiums will not be determined for the time being for goods moved from one warehouse to another and for goods carried on ships flying Chinese and Japanese flags.

### One Japanese Warship Leaves Shanghai

The Destination is Not Reported to the Customs

According to customs sources, the Japanese torpedo boat "Fuji" that was docked at the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong left Shanghai yesterday. However, it was not reported whether it was going to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River or to various coastal areas.

Furthermore, Secretary Tsuyasu has already gone to Beijing yesterday to handle the affairs of the Beijing consulate.

### Students Studying in Japan Request Negotiations to Release Arrested Students

And to Guarantee Their Safety. More Students Return Home Yesterday

Various groups of Chinese students studying in Japan, because the Japanese authorities arbitrarily and unreasonably arrested students studying in Japan, specially sent representatives led by Ye Wenjin back to the country to pay a visit to Ambassador Xu, submitted public letters from various groups, requested negotiations for relief, and because eight arrested students studying in Japan, including Huang Yishi, have no news, and in this tense situation, that country is increasingly hostile to us, specially sent representatives again to return to the country yesterday, carrying three documents, which were submitted to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, requesting that a serious protest be lodged immediately, that the arrested students be released immediately, and that their safety and freedom of research be guaranteed in the future. When the Japanese ship Chichibu Maru arrived in Shanghai at 12 noon yesterday, more than 100 students studying in Japan continued to return to the country. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency specially went to the ship to inquire. According to a gentleman, the Japanese side's war preparation fever has reached an unprecedented level, and this time they seem to be quite fearful of our country. Because the atmosphere in Tokyo is tense, we are all returning to our motherland.

### Young Boss of Zhenhua Silk Factory Accused of Extortion

Arrested in a Brothel on Shantou Road Last Night - Judge Orders Rescheduling, Sun Liangfu Released in Court

Sun Liangfu, a native of Ningbo and the young boss of Qinyi Silk Factory and Zhenhua Silk Factory on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, is 22 years old. Recently, Zhu Wenqing, the young boss of Zhu Hongsheng Wood Shop at 53 Taiwan Road, accused Sun at the Old Zhabei Police Station of extortion. Detective Feng Xiushan arrested Sun at 11:45 pm last night at the Yaqiu brothel on Shantou Road, took him to the police station, and escorted him to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court this morning. Sun Liangfu hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to defend him in court. Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court questioned him. The police station lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the plaintiff in this case, Zhu Wenqing, had married Qiu Youdi four years ago. However, in February of this year, she suddenly ran away. Later, the Zhu family received a warning letter from lawyer Sun Bawu, representing Qiu. Zhu Wenqing and Zhu Juping also hired lawyer Jin Yu to negotiate with her. Eventually, they agreed to negotiate at 9 pm on May 3 in room 502 of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road. On Zhu Wenqing's side, Zhu Juping, his wife Zhu Lin, Zhu's friend Chen Ziyu, and Jin Yu were present. On Qiu's side, Sun Liangfu and Sun Bawu, among others, were present. During the negotiations, Sun Liangfu demanded that Chen Ziyu first hand over 1,000 yuan before negotiations could proceed. Chen only agreed to pay 400 yuan, but Sun insisted on at least 800 yuan, resulting in a breakdown of the negotiations. Later, Zhu Qiu and her mother Qiu Zhang went to the police station to accuse Zhu Wenqing of assault. However, after examination, it was found that she had only suffered minor injuries to her arm, so the case was not accepted. However, after investigation, it was learned that Sun was the instigator, so he was pursued. However, Sun's whereabouts were uncertain, so he was not arrested until yesterday. The police station is now prosecuting him for attempted extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Code. Zhu Juping added that there were also fire brigade personnel and people in yellow uniforms in the room at the time. Sun Liangfu confessed that Qiu Youdi's biological father, Shi Agen, was originally a partner in his factory and had a very good relationship with him. After Shi died, his wife remarried Qiu Xingcun. In April of this year, Qiu Youdi and her mother cried at his house, saying that Youdi was being abused by her husband and asked for help. He then hired the factory's legal counsel, lawyer Sun, to handle the matter. The Yangtze Hotel was found by the plaintiff's side. At that time, Xu Sanlang, the former police chief of the local court, also came with his two apprentices. The amount of 400 yuan was also proposed by them and rejected by him. Judge Qian then ordered the case to be rescheduled for one week and Sun Liangfu was released.

### Security Regiment Seizes Smuggled Scrap Iron

24 Bundles of Scrap Iron Confiscated on the Spot - Bought by Foremen and Transported to Foreign Ships

Zhang Changsong, a member of the Special Affairs Department of the South Shanghai Security Regiment, seized Wang Liyou, a 30-year-old Anhui native, at the Jiangbian Wharf on Bansongyuan Road, South Shanghai, at 2 pm yesterday for smuggling scrap iron. Twenty-four bundles of scrap iron were confiscated on the spot and handed over to the police station. According to the confession, Wang was working as a coolie on a ship at the South Wharf. The scrap iron was hired by two foremen to be transported by boat, specializing in transporting purchases from the Jiangbian Wharf to foreign ships. The case involves the export of prohibited scrap iron and will be submitted to the General Bureau for legal action.

### Murder Case of Xuan Sheng Needs Further Investigation

Defendant Examined for Scars - Court Orders Rescheduling for Further Hearing

In the case of the murder of Xuan Sheng Kuangzuo, a Japanese resident, the former Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng and transferred them to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation and prosecution. They were sentenced to death and imprisonment for murder and endangering public safety, respectively. Mao and others refused to accept the sentence and hired Yu Chengxiu, the lawyer appointed by the first instance, to file an appeal. After repeated trials by the Jiangsu High Court, they were all ordered to reopen the debate. On the morning of the 17th of this month, the hearing was held again. Mao and others still insisted that they had been tortured when they were arrested. The presiding judge ordered the inspection officer to examine them and confirmed that there were indeed scars. The court ordered them to wait for investigation before further trial. Because this matter involves a serious foreign-related case, and the High Court has reopened the debate twice, which is extremely cautious, the reporter visited lawyer Yu Chengxiu a few days ago to inquire about everything. According to Yu, the reasons for the appeal are detailed in the appeal document. At the hearing on the 17th, the judge first announced that Zhu Guisheng was ill and ruled that he should be released on bail. However, he was sent to the hospital for treatment without bail and died. Then, the appellants Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng were interrogated. According to Mao and others, they were tortured after they were arrested and insisted on being examined for scars. The judge then ordered the inspection officer to examine Mao Yonghu, Wang Zhensheng, Jin Daoquan, Chen Enming, and others separately. Mao and others immediately demonstrated the situation of being tortured. As a result, it was found that Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng both had scars on their hands and feet. Jin Daoquan and Chen Enming were considered to have been too long ago, and there were no obvious traces to be found. Yu then defended the facts of the case based on their statements. He also said that Jin Daoquan was very thin and coughed frequently, and he was afraid that he also had lung disease, and requested the court to send him to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for identification if necessary. The court ordered further investigation and trial. In short, the court is handling this case with extreme caution. Although he is handling it on a voluntary basis, he is also very inspired. However, the report a few days ago stated that he declared in court that the fact that the original handling agency used torture to extract confessions was clear, which is somewhat misleading.

### Little Anhui Sentenced to Seven Months for Stealing a Myna and Extortion

Chen Xianhai, a vagrant who lives at 371 Longjiang Road, also known as (Little Anhui), stole a myna bird that could speak human language, raised by Shen Youping, a local, from the vegetable market on Yanshan Road at 10 am on May 6 of this year. He then threatened Shen and extorted 10 yuan in legal tender. After the incident, the Yangshupu Police Station sent detectives to arrest Little Anhui, who was escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the Third Criminal Court, questioned the defendant Chen, and sentenced him to seven months of imprisonment as a warning.

### Jiufeng Silk Factory Sells Short Raw Silk, Dachang Requests Seizure

Workers Demand Work and Payment of Outstanding Wages - Association Asks Landlord to Pay Wages as Usual

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Jiufeng Silk Factory in Zhabei sold short 600 dan of forward raw silk due to stock exchange trading, causing a dispute. Dachang Foreign Firm provided a guarantee of 80,000 yuan and applied to the First Special District Local Court to seize all the factory's machinery, along with about 30,000 yuan worth of dry cocoon inventory. The factory should have resumed work on the 15th in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. However, after the factory owner, Huang Fulin, had his machinery and inventory seized, he was unable to raise funds, resulting in his inability to resume work as scheduled. The factory employs about 1,000 female workers, who have been coming to the factory in batches to make noise, demanding the payment of outstanding wages and requesting a speedy resumption of work to maintain their livelihoods. They also approached the Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Trade Union for consultation. After the trade union consulted with the silk factory trade association representing the owners, the trade association stated that, according to the usual practice of silk factories, the landlord should be responsible for compensating for unpaid wages. It has been found that the factory is the property of Wuxi Jinglun Company. The trade association has sent personnel to Wuxi to find the person in charge of the company and ordered them to pay the wages within one week. As for the resumption of the factory, the factory has been completely sealed, and the factory owner is unable to cope. This is a matter of fact, and the trade association cannot help. It has told the workers to wait for the court to resolve the matter.

### A Blind Couple's Love Life Faces Turbulence

Zheng Chen's Prostitution and Failure to Observe Women's Morality - Zheng Bujin's Deep Love is in Vain

Chen Wenkui, a native of Jiangbei who lives at 51 Boxiang Village, Route de Pères, French Concession, and his wife, Lu, are both nearly fifty years old and have a daughter. Since they were young and blind, they had no way to make a living. Therefore, Chen and his wife had her study astrology from a young age. After she became proficient, she used it to make a living. She went out every day to seek food. Zheng Bujin, a blind man from Jieyang in the same industry, often met Zheng's daughter. Over time, they fell in love, and the two blind lovers began to live together, going out early and returning late every day to make a living. Their feelings were harmonious. Unexpectedly, Chen's heart was like a willow catkin, and she gradually became disgusted with Zheng. She secretly had an affair with another blind man named Yang Quan'gui and became increasingly cold to Zheng. Zheng soon discovered Chen's actions and sued Yang Quan'gui and Chen in the Criminal Court of the Nanshi Local Court for obstructing his family. The trial ended and the defendants were detained for two weeks and released. Chen was still taken back by Zheng to live with him. Recently, when Zheng accompanied his wife Chen to visit her parents, Chen left on the pretext of going to get a haircut and never returned. It has been many days since there has been any news. Zheng Bujin believes that his in-laws are intentionally hiding her, so he filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court, accusing his in-laws Chen Wenkui and Chen Lu of obstructing his family and requesting an investigation. He also attached a civil lawsuit, requesting a judgment ordering them to hand over the person. The court, based on the complaint, summoned the defendants to the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning by Judge Sun Pengham. First, the plaintiff stated the intention of the lawsuit. The defendant Chen Lu was the only one who appeared in court and stated that the plaintiff and her daughter were living together but were not formally married. She also did not know about her daughter's departure. The court recorded the confession and ordered an investigation, rescheduling the trial for another day.

### Small Teahouse in Mud-Walled Enclosure: Tea Dispute Leads to Death

Case Suspended for Over a Year, Still Unresolved; Proprietor Summoned to Testify

Qian Yinsheng, who opened a small teahouse in a mud-walled enclosure in Pudong, on the 24th day of the first month of last year, due to a dispute among tea patrons regarding "eating jiang cha" (settling disputes through mediation), had a conflict with Yang Yusheng, the owner of an iron shop. Yang fired a gun as a warning, but the stray bullet accidentally hit Zhang Jinhai, a barber, who died from his injuries. This case was delayed until this spring. Yang Yusheng was arrested and sent to the District Court for trial. Yang testified that he knew nothing about the incident and suspected that someone else was responsible. The case was then suspended. Yesterday, Qian Yinsheng was summoned by Judge Wang and testified that at the time, because some tea patrons were "eating jiang cha", he refused to let them do so in his teahouse, and he did not know Yang Yusheng at all. Yang was entrusted by someone to make trouble for him. When he tried to leave, Yang fired one shot into the sky and one shot into the ground, and he immediately fled into the room. He did not know how Zhang Jinhai died, but according to his wife, Yang Yusheng's third shot hit him. His own injury was not caused by Yang Yusheng but by Song Quansheng. The judge asked if he recognized Yang Yusheng now, and he replied that he did. The judge then ordered Yang to sit among the crowd and had Qian identify him. However, Yang Yusheng consistently denied it. The judge, believing that there were still doubts in the case that needed to be investigated, ordered a postponement and instructed Qian Yinsheng not to leave Shanghai within fifteen days.

### Xu Xueqing Sued for False Accusation, Sentenced to 20 Days of Detention

Suspended for Two Years, Remainder Not Guilty

Zeng Weiren (aka Guangcai), a Hunan native working as a clerk at the Jianghai Customs, previously took Xu Xueqing (17 years old this year), a woman from Chongqing, Sichuan, as his concubine when he was working at the Chongqing Customs. Later, Zeng was transferred to Shanghai. Xu, finding it inconvenient to travel such a long distance, remained in Chongqing. However, after Zeng left Sichuan, there was no communication with Xu. In the early winter of last year, Xu, being pregnant, came to Shanghai to find Zeng. After meeting, Zeng sent her to a hospital to give birth and provided her with funds to return home. However, Xu came to Shanghai again, demanding lifelong alimony from Zeng, but the case was not accepted by the Special Second Court because it did not meet the proper procedures. Zeng then hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against Xu Xueqing and her mother, Xu Wu, in the Special Second Court, accusing them of false accusation and fraud. He claimed that they had already separated in Sichuan, with a payment of 700 yuan, and after she came to Shanghai last year to give birth, he gave her another 500 yuan. After signing a separation agreement at the lawyer's office, she falsely accused him of fraud and requested an investigation. Judge Sun Pengxian held two hearings and announced the conclusion, awaiting sentencing. The details were recorded in this newspaper yesterday morning. Judge Sun came to the Second Criminal Court and sentenced Xu Xueqing to 20 days of detention, suspended for two years. The remaining charges were dismissed. The judge explained the meaning of the verdict, stating that there was a question of marriage and abandonment between the plaintiff and the defendant, leading to the case of marriage alimony. This cannot be considered as accepting money. However, the defendant's disturbance can only be considered as a minor offense, hence the sentence of detention.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A

(Thirty-two)

(Question) A letter from Zha Gongying in Nanjing states that he came to Nanjing from the interior of Zhejiang, but due to the hurried schedule, he did not have time to bring his cotton quilt. If he buys a new one in Nanjing, he would not use the old one, which is quite wasteful.

(Answer) It can be sent as a postal parcel. The prescribed procedures should be followed: pack it into a parcel, and clearly write the names and addresses of the sender and recipient on the package. Bring it to the nearest post office, and ask for a detailed domestic parcel delivery form to fill out. Submit it together for delivery. The weight of domestic parcels must not exceed 30 kilograms (60 *jin*), and the dimensions, length, width, and thickness, must not exceed one meter and twenty-five centimeters on any side. The volume must not exceed one hundred and twenty cubic decimeters. Items exceeding these limits will not be accepted for delivery. For other important matters, please refer to Q&A in Issue 30 of this newspaper.

Parcels sent from various places in Zhejiang Province to Nanjing are charged at a rate of 20 cents for the first kilogram and an additional 10 cents for each additional kilogram or fraction thereof. (According to the parcel charging standard, the unit is kilograms; fractions less than one kilogram are calculated as one kilogram). The shipping weight of a cotton quilt should be around four kilograms, costing approximately 50 cents in postage. As for the transportation situation, unless there are special circumstances, items are generally shipped as soon as they arrive, and there are no delays en route. Parcels sent from the western part of Zhejiang to Beijing take approximately five days to arrive, while those from the eastern parts of Zhejiang take four days.

(Question) Someone is researching the transportation of local products in various regions and needs to consult the transportation routes in various places. I heard that the postal map published by the post office contains quite a lot of information. What is the name of that map, where can it be purchased, and how much does it cost?

(Answer) The maps published by the post office are divided into two types: 1. Postal District Map; 2. China Post Map. The Postal District Map is a single sheet map, one for each postal district, 107 cm long and 146 cm wide. The local postal management bureaus and first-class post offices in each district, as well as several larger postal management bureaus such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, and Beiping, all sell them (for example, if you want to purchase the Henan Postal District Map in Nanjing, you can purchase it from the Jiangsu Postal Management Bureau in Xiaguan). The price is one national currency yuan per sheet. The China Post Map is bound into a book, 52.5 cm long and 28.5 cm wide, and was published in the winter of last year (this is the fourth edition). It contains a general map of the entire country, 30 divisional maps of various provinces, and inserts of the provincial capitals and major urban areas of each province. The price is fixed at ten national currency yuan per book. Postal management bureaus and first-class post offices in other places all sell them. If you want to purchase them in places other than management bureaus or first-class post offices, you can ask the second- or third-class post offices in those places to handle it for you. In addition, the Directorate General of Posts recently compiled a book entitled "A Record of Products in Areas with Postal Service in China," which contains detailed information on the products, prices, and production seasons of places with postal service throughout the country, and can be used as a reference. The book is sold at the Commercial Press in various locations, and the price is fixed at twelve national currency yuan per book.

### Valuable Academic Research Material

"German Academic Research in the Past Fifty Years", compiled and translated by the Sino-German Cultural Association in Beiping. The first volume has recently been published by the Commercial Press. This book is not only a valuable advance in the translation of German books, but also a valuable resource for those concerned with academic research in Germany. Dr. Shulitze, president of the Sino-German Cultural Association, said that the compilation and translation of this book was initiated by Chinese members of the Translation Committee of the Association, and the translators have been working on it for three years. The book is divided into four volumes, the first of which has been published, and the second, third, and fourth volumes are currently in print and will be available soon. He also stated “The publication of this book has aroused great interest among Chinese friends, which is fortunate.

### Brief Biographies

Words of Chairman Chiang: The gradual revival of the Chinese nation and the progressive improvement of its international status clearly demonstrate the achievements of Chairman Chiang. As for his morality, it is clearly reflected in his daily words and deeds and in his handwritten "Diary of Two Weeks in Xi'an," which manifests his great personality. There is no need for us to elaborate further.

In the club of our Jiangsu Student Training Corps, there are two calligraphies of Chairman Chiang's instructions to us: "Four Essentials for Soldiers" and "Record of Self-Reflection." Here, they are recorded to share with readers:

Four Essentials for Soldiers:

Be worthy of the fallen soldiers,

Be worthy of the spirit of the late Premier,

Be worthy of the parents who gave me life,

Be worthy of the suffering masses.

Record of Self-Reflection:

Have I been loyal to the Doctrine?

Have I been responsible to the Party and the Nation?

Have I had faith in the Commander-in-Chief?

Have I been obedient to my superiors?

Have I been trusting of my subordinates?

Have I been confident in myself?

### Liu San of Jiangnan

— Qingquan

Liu San, a native of Minhang, Shanghai, is a progressive member of the Min Party. Thirty years ago, he was friends with Zhang Taiyan, Zhang Ji of Gaoyang, Zhang Xingyan of Hunan, and Zou Rong of Sichuan. At that time, Zou was the youngest, only nineteen years old, and he wrote a small book called "The Revolutionary Army," signing himself as "The Revolutionary Army's Vanguard Soldier." In fact, Taiyan encouraged him to do so, and Xingyan wrote the title of the book. When the *Subao* case was brought to court, Zou and Taiyan had no choice but to go to prison. Before the year was out, Zou died in prison.

Liu San, whose original name was Jiping, was an old member of the Nanshe Society. His poems and prose were admired throughout the country. Knowing that Weidan (Zou Rong's *zi*, or style name) had sacrificed himself for the country and had no place to be buried, he donated several acres of fertile land in the western suburbs of Shanghai as a burial ground. The person who managed the matter was Xu Jingwu, a native of Ningbo, who made a living by selling books under the Sihai Shengping Teahouse. Those who did not know him called him "King of Fake Chickens," but he was truly an old revolutionary who promoted revolution. As time passed and times changed, Jingwu passed away, and the tomb of the so-called Weidan was unknown. Liu San enjoyed drinking and was skilled in poetry. He went by the name "Liu San of Jiangnan" and composed a couplet which was inscribed at the beginning of a long scroll. The couplet reads "Why learn from the mournful poets, cultivating orchids and planting herbs to record beauty? I should mourn the spring and two winds, thirty-three days of dreams and fallen flowers", "Fang Weng is dead, and the recluse immortal is gone, cutting paper and recalling the unbroken soul. I only fear the flowers will freeze to the bone, so I will not refuse the spring wine to warm you." Reading this, one can imagine what kind of person he was. But ever since he took the post of Supervisor, it has been difficult to see his figure.

Every year during the tennis season, we often see news in the sports section of the newspaper about Miss He Aiying, a female tennis player living abroad, participating in competitions and winning victories. Although Chinese people have never appreciated her tennis skills, she is very well-known in overseas tennis circles.

She is only a sixteen-year-old girl this year. When she was twelve years old, she had already made a name for herself in the tennis world, winning the junior girls' championship. Since then, she has participated in various junior girls' competitions in Britain and France every year, and has often won victories, earning the deep attention of men and women tennis players, who believe that she is the future of women's tennis. The domestic newspapers also often carry news about her competition victories. Therefore, Miss He's fame is deeply imprinted in the minds of every Chinese person who pays attention to tennis, and on the one hand, we are also fortunate that China has such a female tennis player who is famous overseas.

Last year, she had the ambition to participate in the annual Wimbledon World Tennis Championships. However, the British Tennis Association stipulates that male and female tennis players under the age of sixteen are not allowed to participate in Wimbledon competitions. If there were no such age restrictions, then Miss He's participation in the Wimbledon Championships would have been no problem. Because many of the adult female players participating in the competition do not have skills superior to her, and some are even inferior to her.

This year, she is sixteen years old, so her desire to participate in the Wimbledon Tennis Championships has been fulfilled as she wished. She is the youngest of the ninety-seven female players participating in this year's competition. Moreover, due to her small stature, she looks like a twelve- or thirteen-year-old. Her first opponent was Ms. O'Connor, a British female tennis player. After two sets of fierce battles, Miss He lost by a score of six to eight and four to six. Looking at this score, one can see how intense the competition was at that time. Although Miss He was eliminated, the audience and the next day's London newspapers expressed sympathy for the little girl and warmly praised her. Her biggest disadvantage is that she is not tall enough, and another weakness is her backhand. In any case, her future is limitless, and perhaps in three or two years, she will occupy an important position in the world tennis scene.

However, in this Wimbledon Championships, her name is marked with the words "Great Britain." According to the British newspaper's explanation, her parents are Chinese, but she has become a citizen of Great Britain. Here, we hope that the authorities of the Chinese Sports Federation will find a way to solve her nationality issue first. It cannot but be said to be a little funny for a pure Chinese person with black hair and a yellow face to represent Britain on the tennis court!

### Yu Hongjun Works Diligently Day and Night

— Yujiang

The modern Mayor of Shanghai, Mr. Yu Hongjun, is handsome, capable, and has served as the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government for many years. He is trusted by successive mayors, who all know that Yu has participated in municipal affairs for a long time and has rich experience, and they rely on him as an indispensable helper. Before serving as Secretary-General, Yu served as Military Advisor to the Municipal Government for many years, and once served as Acting Director of the Finance Bureau, organizing the municipal treasury, which was quite successful. People in Shanghai should still remember this. According to a friend in the Municipal Government, both former Mayors Zhang and Wu were also members of the Central Executive Committee. After finishing their official duties at 4:00 PM every day, they could leave the government and return home to relax. However, Yu himself, due to his responsibilities, had countless documents that he had to personally review one by one. Even when the government staff had scattered, he would still be working at his desk, sometimes until late at night. It was already commendable that the two former Mayors Zhang and Wu carried out their duties punctually, but it was even more commendable that Acting Mayor Yu had such a spirit of working, so it was no accident that the Central Government ordered him to act as Mayor of the Municipal Government this time.

### Xu Shaodi Sings the Party Song Loudly

In May, the third music concert was held by middle schools in the capital of Zhejiang Province. Xu Shaodi, Director of the Department of Education, attended and delivered a speech. Xu is known for his eloquence, and his speeches are well-organized and captivating. In this speech, Xu specifically cited the effects of his own two times of singing the Party Song loudly, proving the significance of music in education, which was particularly interesting. He said, "It must be known that music has great significance in education, as it can cultivate temperament and invigorate the spirit. Now, based on my personal experiences, I will provide factual proof: I have been participating in the Scout Conference in Wuxing for several days, and I felt quite tired. Yesterday, I returned to Hangzhou and passed through Mount Mogan. I tried to climb the mountain along a rugged path, and at first, I felt quite difficult. So, I started to sing the Party Song loudly, and I immediately felt invigorated and my energy doubled, and I finally reached the top of the mountain. Also, this morning, when I returned to the city from Jianggan, I saw elementary school students running around arbitrarily, and they did not respond when I called out to them. So, I loudly sang the Party Song, and they gathered around upon hearing the song. Then, I taught them the meaning of the New Life Movement and obeying order, and they were all able to understand. Such is the ability of music to move people. I hope you will train diligently to cultivate your personal body and mind, and to promote the national spirit." It is noted that Xu also serves as a member of the Provincial Party Committee in Zhejiang, so his words take into account the Party, education, and the New Life Movement, and although this is a small matter, the wording can be said to be appropriate.

### A Record of Strongman Wang Ziping

— Baling

Anyone familiar with the world of Chinese martial arts must have at least a certain impression of the strongman Wang Ziping. I remember more than ten years ago, when a Russian strongman came to Shanghai to find someone to compete with him, he was a huge sensation, and no one dared to compete with him. As a result, he was defeated by this Strongman Wang, and he relieved us of a breath of frustration and brought back our prestige.

I also remember once when Strongman Wang went to Japan, he met a famous Japanese strongman on the ship who wanted to compete with him. At that time, it was the hot and steamy summer, so everyone was wearing only light clothing. Strongman Wang deliberately wanted to make fun of him, so he frowned and said to him with an idea in mind: "I only need to use a small finger to make you fall!" As soon as he said this, everyone on the ship was a little horrified! Everyone gathered around to see the strength of the two strongmen, especially to see how this Chinese strongman would knock down this famous Japanese strongman with a small finger. However, at this moment, no sooner said than done, I only saw this Strongman Wang moving his posture and immediately walking in front of the Japanese strongman, using his fingernail on his little finger to tickle the Japanese strongman's belly button, causing the Japanese strongman to laugh and fall to the ground. Then, Strongman Wang said to everyone on the ship in public: "How is it? Didn't I knock him down with a small finger? If I used my fist, wouldn't I smash him into pulp?" This incident caused a sensation on the whole ship and was passed on as a good story. Although the strongman used some small cleverness to trouble the Japanese strongman, it was after all a matter of face for our Chinese nation. Now, Strongman Wang has retired. In addition to teaching the skills of Chinese martial arts to several proud disciples, it is said that he also opened a trauma hospital in Xiaoximen, specializing in doing things that benefit the world and benefit people.

### Words of Resistance

— Letian

General Miaga, commander of the Spanish government forces, had some magnificent words in his letter to the soldiers on the front line that could serve as a lesson for us. Here, I have changed the tone and offer it to all compatriots in the country: "...Soldiers and civilians, you are heroes of freedom and independence. Now, let the whole world know that the inhumane troops of neighboring countries who are jumping around in our territory will be annihilated by our army. We swear to defeat the invaders and make them shatter to pieces and be completely annihilated. We must ensure that the Republic of China does not become the second Abyssinia, and after the invaders are defeated and retreat, we must establish a free and powerful New China!"

### A Record of Dr. Zheng Fuhua's Creation of the Capital Ferry

— Ailment Escaped

In the past, when traveling from Shanghai to Ping, upon arriving at Xiaguan, one had to disembark from the train and board a boat to cross the river, braving wind, frost, and turbulent waves. Adding to the difficulty was the need to assist the young and old and transport luggage, which was a great hardship for travelers. Now, one can comfortably sleep in the train carriage and cross the river in a sweet dream. Whom should we thank for this? It is Dr. Zheng, the subject of this article, who single-handedly managed the entire process from proposal to design and construction to completion.

When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it recognized the inconvenience caused by the Yangtze River hindering the through train service between Ping and Shanghai. Consequently, it hired Mr. Huatai'er, an American authority on bridge engineering, for a cost of 40,000 yuan to come to China. After extensively surveying various locations including the Beijing-Hankou, Hangzhou-Shanghai lines, he drafted proposals for bridges along each line. Many in the domestic engineering community were awed by his reputation and followed his lead. However, Mr. Zheng alone opposed his proposals, firmly advocating for ferries. He eventually completed the project himself, at a cost of just over two million yuan. The Qiantang River Railway Bridge, which is currently under construction, is estimated to cost 40 million yuan. Based on this comparison, building a bridge between Xiaguan and Pukou would cost at least 100 million yuan, dozens of times the cost of building a ferry. Therefore, Mr. Zheng once jokingly told a friend that the annual interest earned from the construction funds saved by building the ferry could purchase a new ferry each year. The annual painting and repair costs could cover the ferry's operating expenses. Given the country's poverty, how can such waste be justified? With such a large sum of money, one could build 1,000 kilometers of railway, which would be far superior. He also said that if the Qiantang River Bridge were replaced by a ferry, it would be absolutely safe to operate, and the tidal waves would have no impact. He predicted that the Wuhan Bridge, which is currently being planned, might eventually be replaced by a ferry because it would be difficult to raise the huge funds required and there would be no guarantee of profits.

In fact, Mr. Zheng is the supreme leader in bridge design and planning in our country. The reinforcement of the entire bridge standard on the Jiaoji Railway, and the replacement of bridges on the Tianjin-Pukou and Beining Railways, were all his work. He also served as the head of the design department of the Ministry of Railways for eight years, overseeing the planning of railway bridges nationwide. His firm advocacy for ferries was truly for the sake of saving national resources, preferring to bury his long-honed skills rather than flaunt them.

In the spring of this year, a friend traveled to Huangshan and met Mr. Zheng in Xuancheng, southern Anhui. He was then serving in the Jingqu Railway Bureau, dressed in plain clothes with a dark complexion, just as he had been when teaching at Tangshan Jiaotong University. The friend arrived at the bureau at about 11 o'clock. A card was immediately sent in, and he was invited to the office. They shook hands and reminisced about the old days. Mr. Zheng introduced a middle-aged engineer, saying that this gentleman was there to discuss a bridge design and asked the friend to sit down for a while. He then turned back to the drawing table and continued to explore the design, drawing lines and making calculations with great concentration. After more than an hour, they were still discussing it endlessly. The engineer frequently glanced at the guest, but Mr. Zheng did not notice. The guest's stomach was rumbling with hunger, but he did not feel comfortable leaving. After waiting for another while, the matter was finally concluded. Mr. Zheng then said to his friend, "I'm sorry to have made you sit here bored. It will soon be noon, let's have lunch together and chat." Hearing this, the guest could not help but smile. He looked at his watch and it was already 1:10. Mr. Zheng then rang the bell to order food. After the meal, the guest did not dare to stay any longer and needed to return to the hotel. The next day, the friend went to She County. The engineer, informed by Mr. Zheng, greeted him on the road. He was also a former student of the friend at Tangshan School. During their conversation, he said that Director Zheng's excellent scholarship and diligence were well known, but unfortunately, he was still like a professor in the past, often doing things that were out of touch with reality. He also paid excessive attention to moral integrity, and even if he heard something, whether true or false, he would make a big fuss, which was quite embarrassing. He seemed quite resentful as he spoke. The friend advised him, "The Doctor is old, but as stubborn as ever. As times change, those who are opportunistic and smooth-tongued are being replaced, while those who are loyal, honest, and sincere can accomplish something. Mr. Zheng's future may surpass Zhan Tianyou. One should be more understanding of his minor eccentricities in dealing with the world." He then told him about waiting while hungry, which made the engineer smile and become happy.

The author first met Mr. Zheng ten years ago. He had just returned from abroad and invited me to a tea party, where he showed a film of American bridge construction procedures on the screen. The way he pointed with his fingers and spoke with such fascination and focus is still vivid in my mind. Hearing my friend's words, I wrote this down in a disorganized manner to introduce to the nation this technician who buries himself in his work and rarely receives praise.

### Strengthening Our National Foundation

— Huamin

If a country wants to be prosperous and strong, it must consolidate its national foundation.

Promoting hygiene and advocating for domestic goods are the main conditions for consolidating the national foundation.

Soap, which removes dirt and grime, is indispensable for a clean and hygienic life.

Among the domestic soap manufacturers, Wuzhou Gubenzhao Pharmaceutical Factory is the most diligent. Its products include: Gubenzhao Soap, Gubenzhao Perfumed Soap, Gubenzhao Medicated Soap, Gubenzhao Soap Flakes, and other varieties. All of these can meet the needs of society and can be said to be honorable contributions among domestic goods.

We should all consistently purchase "Guben" brand soaps for washing clothes and bathing our bodies. This will not only achieve the goals of "promoting hygiene" and "advocating domestic goods," but also strengthen our national foundation.

### Swapping the Phoenix in Its Nest

Chapter Sixteen (News Inquires in the Southern City; Yun Window Tells of Dreams; Romantic Resignation at the Banquet; Return of the Carriage on the Brothel Lane)

Youmei said: It happened last night. Guoqi was originally sitting down. Then he clapped his thighs with both hands at the same time, stood up, and exclaimed, "That's right!" Youmei said: Did you see him leave the house? How can you say "That's right?" Guoqi laughed: Of course I have evidence. But in my heart, I'm certain it's true. But saying it out loud seems childish. Youmei said, "I don't understand what you mean." Guoqi looked at the shadows of the trees outside the window. He pondered for a while. Then he smiled and said: Although it's broad daylight, I'm going to tell you a dream. I got drunk last night and had a dream all night long. The most wonderful part of the dream was seeing you and him walking together. His two feet were chained together, and he could hardly take a step. Fortunately, you held his hand and helped him walk step by step. Youmei supported her chin with her hands, nodded repeatedly, and said "Oh" twice. She smiled and asked, "Then, where were you helping him walk to?" Guo smiled: That's right, you should ask that question. Otherwise, there would be no value in this dream. You were helping him walk on a mountain path. At first glance, the mountain didn't seem very high, but after looking at it for a long time, the mountain layers receded into the distance, pushing the mountain peak to hide in the clouds. Later, I only saw one person. Walking faintly on the ridge, it was no longer two people. Youmei said: Only one person left. Who is this person? Can you see clearly? Guoqi listened to her words but did not answer. He raised his head and looked out the window at the sky. He saw that the small tree under the eaves was still trembling, shaking the sparse leaves that were about to fall off. It seemed like the spirit of the person walking on the mountain peak in the dream. He nodded in the air and said: How beautiful, how noble, and how great. Youmei heard him praise repeatedly, but she didn't know who he was praising. However, in the current situation, there was only one woman here. If he wasn't praising himself, who else would he be praising? She couldn't help but blush and lower her head. Guoqi finished imagining this fantasy, and Youmei turned her head. Seeing that Youmei was sitting diagonally across from her, feeling a little embarrassed, he smiled and said: Miss Li, do you understand what I'm saying? She then looked at him, snorted in her nose, nodded, and said: I'm not very stupid after all. I can probably understand what my cousin is saying. But when it comes to studying, I'm not as good as my cousin. If my cousin speaks like he's writing an article, then I wouldn't understand. As she said this, she smiled slightly. Her long eyelashes surrounded her eyes, and her dark eyes were rolling around inside her eyelashes. Then she lowered her head again. Guoqi pretended not to notice her intentions. Seeing that two red blushes had appeared on her cheeks, as if she were a little shy, he smiled and said: Do I speak with an essay-like tone? I didn't realize that. Which of my words has the meaning of an essay? (199)

Text:

It has been more than ten days since the Japanese army launched an unprovoked attack on the Lugouqiao and Wanping areas in western Beijing on July 8th. Looking at the recent situation, on the one hand, the Japanese army is continuously attacking our army and rapidly importing large numbers of reinforcements from outside the pass, showing signs of a large-scale offensive war. On the other hand, there are so-called peace negotiations being held in Tianjin and other places. We sincerely doubt what the so-called "peace negotiations" currently underway in the North are about?

We want to clearly point out here: Under the pressure of Japanese imperialism's cannons, even the minimum peace negotiations are absolutely impossible to establish, unless the Chinese side gives the enemy some concessions! The central authorities have repeatedly stated that the negotiations in North China are not a local matter, and any agreement must be approved by the central government before it takes effect. On the other hand, the figures conducting peace negotiations with the Japanese side in North China have also stated that they will seek peace under the condition of not losing rights and humiliating the country. In fact, these statements do not guarantee that the outcome of the Lugouqiao Incident will not be something like the "He-Umezu Agreement." Because we know from the lessons of the past that every negotiation with the enemy has resulted in humiliation. Furthermore, saying that these negotiations will not accept any humiliating conditions, I dare to point out in advance: this is absolutely impossible!

Therefore, we advocate: The current negotiations should be stopped immediately. If it is necessary to negotiate for the sake of the overall situation, we only have one thing to say to the enemy: Quickly withdraw your troops - there is no room for discussion. Because we will never forget the words of our great leader Chairman Chiang: "If the enemy invades one more inch of our land, it will be the last moment of our sacrifice"! Now the Japanese army is freely rampaging in the Pingxi area, and the area invaded is not just one inch of land, but several square miles! Therefore, now is the time when the "last sacrifice" has arrived, without a doubt. Because our only request is to resist the war immediately! Mr. Wang Jingwei said: We are "resisting Japan" not "rejecting Japan," then here we want to shout: The whole country unites to resist Japan! This is the time for the whole nation to fight the enemy!

We respectfully and firmly demand from the government: Immediately order the termination of all peace negotiations in North China, because this is undoubtedly humiliating to the country; immediately transfer a large army to the north and inform the people that patriotism is not a crime and allow the existence of all national salvation organizations.

Secondly, what we the people must immediately do on our own: Raise donations and provide comfort, organize anti-enemy mass organizations, support the government's strong foreign policy, and boycott enemy goods, etc.

The situation is critical, a matter of life and death, the Lugouqiao Incident is likely to be followed by the fall of the entire North China! To defend North China, and to seek a line of survival for the Chinese nation, then resisting the enemy and saving the country has now reached the final moment! We enthusiastically support the government in leading the 450 million hot-blooded people to engage in a desperate struggle with the enemy!

### "July 8th" in Beiping

— Zhifu

A Conversation with a Returning Southerner

Although it had already rained heavily, and although a cool evening breeze had risen in the sky, making people feel much more comfortable, the small room was crowded with the four of us, so the temperature inside still didn't seem to have decreased at all.

I was waving my fan, and the sweat on my forehead was still dripping down my cheeks. But the returning southerner's conversation didn't lower his voice because of the heat. He spoke passionately, and a few times I almost raised my arms like him. I was too moved.

However, I calmed down each time. In order to hear the rest of his conversation, my two friends also remained quiet and didn't cough. Finally, he continued: -

"Friends! Ever since the ** people seized our Manchuria, Beiping and Tianjin have not only become their ideal territories, but they have also long had the ambition to seize the entire North China! ... In the past, didn't they provoke our garrison several times in Fengtai over some trivial matters? But they were greatly disappointed that the play didn't develop into that scene several times. ... But are they really disappointed, friends? ... No, they will never easily give up their ambition to invade. ... Therefore, friends! We have long expected that the incident in Tianjin and Tianjin is absolutely unavoidable...

"... Friends! But in the present time, as long as they are not traitors, every people who don't want to be slaves to the nation, who is willing to let the ** people come in again? You think.

## Page 20

... especially our loyal officers and soldiers of the Twenty-ninth Army, when they came to disturb us on the night of July 8th, they raised their guns and rushed towards our greatest enemy. ...

"But, friends! ... The night when the cannons sounded on the Lugouqiao Bridge, the residents of Beiping city were all terrified! However, friends! - In order to strengthen the determination of the people in the rear to resist *, in the heart of Beiping, which was closed the city gate, we began to do what we should do! ...

"Friends! Our only way out now is to go to the front line and resist the war, friends! We must shout out the slogan 'strike back against those who strike us'! ... On the streets and in the alleys, we talked to the beloved people like this. - And the people are happy to listen to our words. ...

"A few times we were simply extremely happy:

"Friends! I tell you: The first day we set out was in a famous hutong in Xizhimen. But it is now very deserted here! We used the power of copper bells to gather more than ten nearby residents: Then we began to report on the war situation in the Ping suburbs, and the several knowledge that the people in the rear should have ... They were moved! I saw someone in the crowd rubbing their fists and shouting: "Kill ** people", "We want to survive and die with Tianjin!" ... the slogan. Friends! Our people are not numb after all!

"Then, the propagandists who were traveling with us began to sing tragic national salvation songs: -

"Arise, those who do not want to be slaves! Put our flesh and blood...'"

"The thick voices and the thin voices ... combined into a powerful chorus, painting the air of the entire hutong with a kind of solemnity and tension ... Friends! Who among these people is willing to be slaves to the nation? ...

"However, the singing alarmed the police on the street. - The police came. He shouted loudly to stop us:

"'You are not allowed to make such a fuss!'"

"'We love our country, are we not allowed to?'"

"'You are not allowed to sing loudly'"

"'We must sing, oppressing patriots is also a traitor!'"

"'Traitors, get out of here ...'"

"'........'" The police finally turned red in the face, but quietly retreated.

"Friends! We are really happy! - Unlike the things of last year, they would take water dragons and wooden sticks to abuse us, you think, the police now also forgive our enthusiasm, we are too grateful to him!

"However, my friends! Since I was forced back to the South by my environment, the events in Pingjiao have continued to this day. I believe that this ancient and noisy city of Beiping will soon burst out with bright sparks, let us young people who are unwilling to be slaves to the nation! ...

### The Victory of the Ants

— Ziming

After dinner, everyone sat in the courtyard to enjoy the cool air, which was the most comfortable time in summer. Slowly eating the remaining melons and fruits from the day, the so-called floating melons and sinking plums, had its own kind of pleasure. Morning glories climbed on the flower wall, blooming with one or two white small flowers. Not knowing what flew over, the small kitten that was lying at my feet suddenly pounced on the flower wall in a predatory manner, but it gained nothing, returned in disappointment, and washed its face with its front legs. The crystal clear moon had already risen above the corner of the roof.

The youngest child squatted at the foot of the flower wall, seeming to be listening to something. He liked crickets the most, perhaps he was digging for treasure there again. The older brother seemed to have discovered the secret too, and quietly snuck up behind him and covered his eyes. This unexpected attack made him scream, but he immediately knew that it was his brother's prank, did not pull away his brother's palm, and shouted:

"Brother, look!"

At the foot of the flower wall, a battle was unfolding, a mantis was being besieged by a group of ants. The mantis appeared very brave and was waving its double knives, the ants rolled east and west like small balls, but a few were desperately biting its wings, making it unable to quickly break through the encirclement, and more and more ants were gathering.

The sky was already very dark, and the moonlight was blocked by the lush branches and leaves of the morning glories, occasionally when the wind blew and shook, it filtered down moving circles of light, the verdant mantis was surrounded by a group of wriggling small animals, it was really a beautiful picture.

The older brother also waited patiently to watch. They gradually squatted a little closer, like scientists in a chemical laboratory examining their new inventions. The younger brother even used a small grass stem to guide the ants from the nest directly to the front line, while preventing the mantis from killing the enemy. Watching its double knives gradually unable to wave, and the ants on its body were getting more and more, like a chicken that couldn't swim falling into a small river, struggling desperately and finally unable to move.

The ants naturally won the final victory. The brothers cheered happily, because they felt a kind of spiritual joy. When everyone gathered at the foot of the flower wall to watch, borrowing the moonlight, they saw a small black mountain slowly moving along the base of the wall.

"Perhaps these ants are singing a song of triumph?" I thought.

When I returned to the house, when the brothers were studying under the lamp, I asked them what was the reason why such small ants could defeat a mantis.

"That is the power of unity!" they answered together.

"Only unity can survive!" The battle between ants and mantises was indeed a very old-fashioned fable, but every fable can give us a very good lesson.

### A Song of Bitter Rain

— Changji

A group of people, including the porters, totaling fifteen, set off for Ankang County despite the rain. The five pairs of straw sandals made a squeaking sound as they walked! Splashing mud and water all over their bodies. Especially the porters, who were carrying heavy luggage on their shoulders, landed much heavier than the empty-handed guests, and the mud and water splashed even higher. At this time, everyone had filled their bellies and were walking with a burst of energy, unlike the exhaustion they felt when they arrived at the inn yesterday. However, everyone cursed the mischievous sky in unison, as the incessant drizzle had not stopped for several days. The already dilapidated and winding mountain path was now even more slippery and difficult to walk on. Everyone carefully stepped steadily, winding and turning one stretch after another.

What made this group of people feel the most difficult was crossing one ditch after another. A torrent rushing straight down from the mountain flowed rapidly through everyone's toes, invisibly hindering the speed of progress. If you stepped on the moss on the stones, you would definitely fall to your death in the ditch. Everyone's faces and hair were like they had just been soaked in water, wet and dripping, and it was hard to tell whether it was sweat or rainwater.

"Why are there so many ditches? How many more days will it take to get there!" one of the guests complained to himself, seeming unaccustomed to such a dangerous road.

"Boss, more than half the road is done. If it clears up right away, then we'll be in Ankang County in two more days."

An old porter with a slightly hunched back, showing his few remaining yellow teeth, comforted the complaining guest with this very experienced remark.

"Brother Ma, it's really hard on you this time. Unfortunately, the weather is bad, and we're on the road in this rainy season; not to mention that it's difficult for you to walk carrying such heavy things, even we who are walking empty-handed are really tired."

"As long as there are no accidents on the road and we arrive safely, Boss, we are very happy even if we are a little more tired!"

"I hope so, let's have an early rest stop today!"

"No, we must cross the Shandaogou Ditch today before we can rest, that is a dangerous ditch! I'm afraid that even the ferry won't dare to cross such a large flood. Let's hurry up and try to figure out a way!"

Everyone felt that Brother Ma's words were correct, so they mustered their spirits to hurry on. When they arrived at the Shandaogou Ditch, the sky became even darker, and a roaring waterfall flowed in the ditch, splashing water onto the shore. At this time, even shouting at the top of your lungs could not find a trace of a ferry, and everyone's hearts could not help but become anxious.

"What should we do? Brother Ma!"

"Can't we stay here overnight? Brother Ma!"

Everyone asked the old and experienced Brother Ma these questions, forcing him to look helpless and not know whether to laugh or cry.

"Don't panic! It was said that even the ferry wouldn't dare to cross such a large flood, now let me go and look for one!"

He searched for a small wooden boat in several ditches. The boat was also hidden in this secluded place because it didn't dare to risk it. He couldn't resist Brother Ma's pleading and agreed to take them across the ditch. This made Brother Ma's face light up with joy, and he shouted loudly:

"The boat is here, everyone, come and get on the boat!"

More than a dozen people hurriedly rushed onto the boat, but the very small boat body was a bit heavy and couldn't bear it. After a violent shock, the boatman braced himself and pushed the bamboo pole, leaving the embankment and rushing into the turbulent waves; everyone was carrying a feeling of danger tied to this drifting wasteland of misty rain.

### A Reply to Mr. Bu Hui Baixiang

— Lao Baixiang

The other day, I was in high spirits and wrote a playful letter to a friend as a joke. Unexpectedly, before I even received a reply, a Cheng Yaojin jumped out from the side, with a burly build and eyes like copper bells, wielding an eighteen-foot spear, ready to join the battle. I couldn’t help but be shocked. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was also an old friend of over a decade, which put my mind at ease.

Speaking of the words "Lao Baixiang" (Old Playboy), I feel quite ashamed. In my life, I've never been good at "baixiang" (playing around, being frivolous), and being an "old" one is even more undeserved. However, I am now of an age where I have some experience, neither too significant nor insignificant, so regarding the art of living in the world, if I may be so bold, I do have a considerable understanding. In the past, I had a terrible temper and would always mess with anyone, and I always had to do things my own way, no matter what. But now that I'm getting older, I've encountered plenty of obstacles and learned that this path is completely unworkable in the world. Talking about the art of living in such a way is simply going backward.

So, I sought out an old master. Do you all know his name? Mentioning it really makes him appear impressive. His surname is Li, and his given name is Dan, and it is said that he was even our Taixiansheng (Great Ancestor), the teacher of our first sage and master, Zha Lao Fuzi (Lao Tzu). His art of living was extremely profound. The key to his art of living was the six characters: "He qi guang, tong qi chen" (harmonize with its light, assimilate with its dust). I studied these two doctrines for nearly thirty or forty years before daring to make them public. That's why my temper has changed now, drastically so. I am a "hutiao" (nonsensical, fooling around) advocate.

How did I change? The origin of the name "Lao Baixiang" lies here. The ancients impersonated sages and virtuous men; how dare I impersonate a Baixiang? Sages and virtuous men can be impersonated, but an old Baixiang can never be impersonated. If one were to impersonate, one would surely reveal one's true colors. But I have spent decades studying the ability to harmonize with the light and assimilate with the dust, and it is here that I display my skills. The meaning of the four characters "harmonize with the light and assimilate with the dust," when interpreted using modern sociological terminology, is simply "hutiao." Because of "hutiao," the title of "Lao Baixiang" was placed upon me as high as a coronation for the King of England.

But my appetite is truly excellent. I never get angry and am determined to refuse nothing. If people call me a horse, I will answer that I am a horse; if people call me an ox, I will answer that I am an ox. If people call me Lao Baixiang, I naturally accept it with reverence. In fact, it's truly a wrongful injustice. I originally wanted to hire a famous lawyer to sue at the International Court of Justice in The Hague for the crime of slander under article 19,999 of the criminal law. But after feeling around in my pocket and finding nothing, this idea was abandoned. Moreover, if I were to file a lawsuit, I would inevitably ruin the secret of "hutiao" that I have spent decades forging, which would also be a pity. Therefore, the thought of litigation has fled to Guazhu country. I unapologetically consider myself an old Baixiang. Actually, I have many nicknames, such as "Old Fox" and "Old Sly," which are all my famous names, but these other nicknames do not have the honor of the two words "Lao Baixiang."

However, this friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang," I know that he is a truly genuine, unadulterated old Baixiang. Dogs need to "baixiang," birds need to "baixiang," goldfish need to "baixiang," and flowers and trees are even his specialty, also needing to "baixiang." The friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang" happens to be good at it, while the famous old Baixiang happens not to know how to "baixiang." There is nothing more unfair in the world than this. The reason why the world is not easily peaceful lies in this.

The friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang," I know that he is very emotional. Since he unfortunately encountered "xiaogu" (minor accidents) after "xiaogu," horizontally "xiaogu," vertically "xiaogu," sitting he sees "xiaogu," walking he sees "xiaogu," in the room he sees "xiaogu," in the garden he also sees "xiaogu," touched by objects he recalls memories, constantly reciting about "xiaogu." Now seeing the Lugouqiao Incident, he is again enraged, wanting to follow behind the machine guns and cannons to kill towards Lugouqiao and fight the enemy to the death. Even if he were to sleep with the martyred heroes, it would be nothing. How heroic, how valiant! It can be seen that a person rich in emotions will always be emotionally affected. With deep affection, he still wants to drag the old Baixiang to Lugouqiao to "baixiang" amidst a flood of tears. This patriotic enthusiasm is truly admirable to the point of complete submission.

However, in recent years, my thoughts of negativity have reached 2,800 degrees below freezing point. Not only do I not ask about world affairs, but I also don't ask about family and personal matters. The houses in my hometown have been in disrepair for years, and the gate is especially damaged. As a result, stray dogs have been invading one after another. I absolutely do not want to resist the stray dogs, nor do I want to make things difficult for them. My thoughts of negativity have finally reached their extreme. I don't even keep family matters in mind, let alone Lugouqiao, which is thousands of miles away. What does it have to do with me? But now, hearing the friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang" say such things, I can't help but have my dying embers reignite and heat up, even hotter than white heat, willing to go to Lugouqiao with the friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang" to taste the bullets and shells. Please, everyone, rise up together.

The books that I used to read, I have returned them to the teacher untouched. Especially poetry and songs, I have never learned them. The friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang" brought out many rigid poems and soft lyrics to make fun of me, which is simply playing the lute to a cow, winking at a blind man – equally ineffective. I only know a saying: "I would rather argue with a Suzhou person than talk to a Ningbo person," because the tone of Suzhou people is very soft. Not to mention chatting with them, it's very pleasant to listen to. Even arguing with them is very interesting. The friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang" has lived in Suzhou for a long time, and I know that he must be softened into a state of confusion. Who knew that he would sometimes be harder than a Ningbo person, truly coming from outside the belly. Recently, the weather has been so hot that it makes the wax-headed devil's fire blaze. I don't have the energy to write any further. Please everyone eat less and eat more pickles. I reply briefly, wishing you all peace.
