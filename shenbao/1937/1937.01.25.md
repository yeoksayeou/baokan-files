The situation in Shaanxi and Gansu will soon be completely clarified and resolved. We will never tolerate aggressors beyond the limit. The intention of publishing in the Shanghai newspapers that Yu is not Chinese is very obvious.

However, a small number of remnants are still unrepentant and willing to be lackeys. They are preparing to counterattack us in the near future. What are the Vice Chairman's observations on this?" He replied, "This is just the last struggle of the bandit puppet army. After our army recovered Bailingmiao, Damiaozi, and Shiyushan, etc., and the generals defected, the bandit puppet army no longer has combat power. Even if there are forces from other bandit puppet armies that participate later, our national army has made full preparations." The reporter asked, "The situation in Shaanxi and Gansu is not optimistic. Will this matter affect the Suiyuan war?" He replied, "The situation in Shaanxi and Gansu will soon be completely clarified. In short, because the national crisis is so severe, the central government has shown the greatest leniency. This point is recognized by the entire country. We very much hope that this issue can be resolved by supporting the central government and obeying Chairman Chiang's orders." The reporter asked, "Chairman Chiang's one-month vacation is about to end. Is there any news of him coming to Nanjing?" He replied, "Chairman Chiang's health is improving day by day. As far as I know, he will come to Nanjing in the near future to preside over military and political affairs." The reporter asked, "How will Sino-Japanese relations evolve?" He replied, "Peace in the Far East is what we deeply desire. However, we will never tolerate countries that invade our country beyond the limit. Therefore, we deeply regret the provocative policies of the aggressors, especially the use of newspapers and their like to fabricate black and white and confuse right and wrong. It is amazing. Recently, the Shanghai newspapers published rumors that Yu is not Chinese. The intention is very obvious. It is the same as the intention of slandering Chairman Chiang not long ago." At this point, a guest arrived, and the reporter bid farewell. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)

### Smuggling Case Cracked in Kinmen

Taiwanese man Wei Rongtai Claims to Have Paid Fees to the County Government. Smuggled Goods Usually Unloaded in Lieyu with Rarely Any Busts.

Xiamen correspondent: The Second Brigade of the Xiamen Marine Police recently received a report that Jinlongxing Trading Company, a Japanese-Taiwanese company in the city, had shipped 90 bags of smuggled white sugar and 300 barrels of kerosene, worth over 6,000 yuan, from Taiwan and unloaded them in Lieyu, Kinmen County, outside Xiamen Port. The brigade immediately dispatched more than ten detectives on a gunboat to Lieyu on the evening of the 18th to intercept and seize the goods. They found 280 barrels of kerosene, 22 bags of sugar, and 38 packages of seafood inside Lieyu Elementary School. However, Lin Qun, the captain of the First Security Company of the Kinmen County Government, arrived with more than ten soldiers and claimed that the security team had already discovered and seized the goods, preventing their transport to Xiamen. The Marine Police and the Security Team jointly inventoried the goods, and the goods were handed over to the Security Team for safekeeping. On the 20th, the Kinmen County Government handed over the people and goods to the Xiamen Customs. After this incident, Wei Rongtai, the owner of Jinlongxing Trading Company, claimed, "The goods seized by the Kinmen County Security Team in Lieyu belong to the company, but fees have been paid to the Kinmen County Government: one yuan and five jiao per bag of sugar, two jiao per barrel of kerosene, and one jiao for miscellaneous fees. The payments were entrusted to a Kinmen gentleman to liaise with Deputy Officer He of the county government. Each time the goods arrived, Squad Leader Fan would check the number of items and Officer He would come to collect the money. Two hundred and fifty yuan had already been paid in the previous period. When these goods arrived, two hundred yuan was paid on the 17th and fifty yuan was paid on the 18th, all handled by Officer He. Unexpectedly, when unloading the goods on the evening of the 18th, Company Commander Lin Qun sent a team to seize the goods. Upon hearing the news, the company immediately sent shop employees Yang Kuozui and Chen Ben (both Chinese nationals) to Lieyu to negotiate and request leniency. Commander Lin demanded 250 yuan before releasing the goods. While they were arguing, a Xiamen informant reported to the Second Brigade of the Marine Police, who rushed to intercept the goods that night. When Commander Lin saw the Marine Police arriving, he turned private gain into public service, claiming that the security team had already discovered the goods and detained shop employees Yang Kuozui and Chen Ben, accusing them of being traitors. It has now been decided to negotiate with the Kinmen County Government and accuse the county authorities." It is also reported that the Provincial Government is sending personnel to Xiamen to secretly investigate smuggling. The details of this case have been reported to the province for thorough investigation. Smuggling in Fujian Province is most prevalent through the use of sailboats or motorboats from Taiwan carrying goods across the Taiwan Strait, evading customs patrols, and landing in various coastal areas. The operators are Taiwanese merchants, scoundrels, and gentry, colluding with each other. Xiamen and its vicinity, especially Lieyu in Kinmen, is the main base for smuggling. Because the island is located outside Xiamen Port, only thirty li from Xiamen City, smugglers mostly unload and store goods in Lieyu, and then transport them piecemeal into Xiamen and the Zhangzhou hinterland. This has long been known to everyone in Xiamen, but there have been few busts. For a long time, there has been suspicion of inside dealing. Therefore, the occurrence of this case requires a thorough investigation of the truth to dispel public doubts. (January 22nd)

Current Commentary

### Relief of Food Panic in Guangdong Province

— Liu

The issue of tax exemption for foreign rice in Guangdong Province could have been concluded after the Executive Yuan approved a partial tax exemption for 300,000 metric tons. Unexpectedly, the food emergency in Guangdong Province has not eased. Recently, it was reported that a Food Relief Committee has been established in the province to continue to request the exemption of foreign rice taxes, while those in the food industry strongly argue that there is no need to import foreign rice tax-free, seemingly wanting to prevent Guangdong Province from making the request. Both sides have their own positions, and we have no way to judge their merits. However, based on past and present facts, the way to handle this is not without room for discussion.

Guangdong Province's rice shortage, relying on foreign rice for supply, did not start recently. In the past, even when foreign rice was not easy to obtain and native rice could be supplied in large quantities, foreign rice was often imported in large quantities. The events of 1920 are a testament to this. Since then, the amount of long-grain rice from the Yangtze River imported into Guangdong Province has decreased year by year, to a maximum of two to three million dan (a unit of weight), and as little as tens of thousands of dan. The quantity of foreign rice imported has increased year by year, with annual requirements ranging from sixteen to seventeen million dan to as little as five to six million dan. A critical situation has already formed, and the way to remedy it is to have sufficient supply of native rice and complete and responsive transportation facilities. Because rice production has no reliable figures to verify, blindly following unreliable estimates, thinking that using the surplus of four provinces to supply the food of one province is not easy, is a serious mistake.

Since the Executive Yuan approved a partial tax exemption for 300,000 metric tons of foreign rice for Guangdong Province, rice prices in Shanghai have weakened. However, after the north-south transportation of rice this year, grain prices rose sharply again in a month or two. The current price of japonica rice, if calculated according to the old "hu" (bushel), is the highest record in nearly seven years, not far from the price at the same time in 1929. This is already the case with the issuance of new wheat orders. If unfortunately the future price of rice is as high as 22 or 23 yuan as in 1930, what will be done at that time?

Moreover, the 300,000 metric tons of foreign rice, with partial tax recorded, is equivalent to 500,000 dan in the old system of weights, which is insignificant compared with the quantity imported by Guangdong Province over the years. If grain prices rise again, foreign rice can be traded even without tax exemption. Therefore, we believe that to deal with the current food problem, we should think about the overall interests and make reasonable arrangements. The food problem of Guangdong Province is important, and the food problem of other provinces is also important. Not long ago, various provinces had large quantities of grain leaving the country, and grain prices soared, leading to a ban on exports. If grain prices change drastically again in the future, who knows if the order to suppress price increases will not be re-issued?

In short, if we adhere to theoretical arguments, book figures, the distorted market situation, and proposals that only consider partial interests to solve the food problem, it is difficult to expect a proper solution.

### Paris-Tokyo Flight Fails; Aviator's Efforts Fall Short

Forced Landing on a Small Island in Tokyo Bay; Both Men Safe, Aircraft Damaged

Local news: According to a telegram received in this city, the aircraft of French aviator Douré was forced to land on a small island in Tokyo Bay, 80 kilometers from Mangjie on the Annam-Guangdong border. The aircraft was severely damaged. Mr. Douré has given up hope of continuing the flight and left the aircraft on the island. He himself is going to Hanoi and has decided to abandon his ambitious plan. (Alliance News dispatch on the 24th)

[Paris] The Ministry of Aviation recently issued a bulletin stating that French aviators Douré and Micheletti took off from Hanoi, Vietnam, at 7:35 a.m. yesterday (Greenwich time, which is 3:35 p.m. Shanghai time). Until 2:50 p.m. (10:50 p.m. Shanghai time), the flight was going very well. It was expected that they could fly to Shanghai by 6:00 p.m. (2:00 a.m. Shanghai time today), but due to bad weather, they were forced to land on a small island north of Tokyo Bay. Both men are safe. The island is located between "Tianting" (transliteration) city in the French protectorate of Tokyo and "Binta Point" (in Mengjie city). (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

[Tokyo] French aviator Mr. Douré hoped to set a new record by completing the flight between Tokyo and Paris in 100 hours, but unexpectedly, he was forced to land in Tokyo Bay in Annam, and his ambitious plan was thwarted. The record from Paris to Hanoi, starting at 6:36 a.m. on the 20th (Japanese time, which is 3:36 p.m. on the same day; the following times are all in Japanese time), was 71 hours and 20 minutes. If no obstacles occurred, the 2,300 kilometers between Hanoi and Shanghai could be flown in 10 hours, and the 2,100 kilometers between Shanghai and Tokyo should take 8 hours. Even with refueling in Shanghai, there would be plenty of time. In any case, it could be completely reached within 21 or 22 hours, with ample time within 100 hours. Unfortunately, he was hampered by bad weather, resulting in the failure of his efforts. Those in the know regret this. (Alliance News dispatch on the 24th)

### Russian Ambassador to Japan Returns Home Next Month

Arita Holds Farewell Banquet

[Tokyo] Russian Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, is scheduled to return home on the 5th of next month. Foreign Minister Arita hosted a farewell banquet at 1:00 p.m. today.

It is reported that after the ambassador returns to Moscow, he will report Japan's policies and recent political situation in detail based on the above talks, so that the Soviet Union can decide on a new policy toward Japan.

### Japanese Political Situation Takes a Sudden Turn; Ugaki Receives Mandate to Form Cabinet

Aizawa and Nagai Expected to Succeed as Foreign Ministers; New Cabinet's Dissolution of Parliament Seems Inevitable

[Tokyo] The Japanese Emperor issued a decree at 10:00 p.m. tonight to Ugaki Kazushige to form a new cabinet. Ugaki is currently vacationing in Nagaoka. After receiving the decree, he immediately set out for Kyoto. He may enter the Imperial Palace late at night to meet the Emperor. If Ugaki succeeds in forming a cabinet, Aizawa Kenkichi or Nagai Ryutaro, the secretary-general of the Minseito party, are most likely to be the new foreign minister. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)

[Tokyo] General Ugaki has been recuperating in Nagaoka, Izu. Upon receiving the Imperial mandate, he departed from Mishima Station at 10:00 p.m. and is scheduled to arrive at Yokohama Station at 12:00 a.m., where he will transfer to a car and enter Kyoto to meet with the Emperor. (Alliance News dispatch on the 24th)

[Tokyo] The Japanese Emperor issued an edict today, ordering General Ugaki, who previously served as Governor-General of Korea, to form a new cabinet. Ugaki is 67 years old and was appointed Governor-General of Korea in June 1931, a post he held until August of last year, when he resigned due to the February 26 Incident. Although he has been in retirement, his power remains. Therefore, his appointment to form a cabinet this time is within the expectations of most people. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

Okitsu: Interior Minister Yuasa arrived here at 2:48 p.m. on the 24th and immediately went to Zagyosho to meet with Prince Saionji to convey the Imperial message. Yuasa explained the process of the Hirota cabinet's resignation and the general situation. After briefly familiarizing himself with the situation, he entrusted the Interior Minister to convey the responses from various ministries to the Emperor. Yuasa left at 4:20 p.m., took an express train from Shimizu Station to return to Kyoto, and is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo at 7:45 p.m. He will then meet with the Emperor to relay Prince Saionji's responses to the inquiries. (Alliance News dispatch on the 24th)

[Tokyo] The new cabinet, in view of the strong demands made by the army, has shown even greater reformist tendencies. The army has consistently advocated for the reform of administrative institutions to a certain extent. Political parties cannot send party representatives as cabinet members. The number of cabinet members should be reduced as much as possible. In the future, some provinces may have to be abolished. The succeeding cabinet will not cooperate with political parties. Therefore, both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are in complete opposition. The outcome will be the dissolution of the parliament by the new cabinet, which seems inevitable in the current situation, and the New Party movement will take the dissolution of the parliament as a good opportunity, and its activities will become public. (Alliance News dispatch on the 24th)

[Tokyo] The selection of a successor to the current Japanese cabinet is currently under consultation with elder statesman Prince Saionji. According to observations here, the strongly worded statement issued by the Ministry of the Army, which not only insists that future leaders must be able to demonstrate the true spirit of the unique Japanese constitution and exercise fair and powerful politics, but also strongly criticizes political parties for their lack of understanding of the current political situation, pursuing only party interests and falling into a deep abyss of passivity and retrogression, has indirectly indicated a refusal to cooperate with existing political parties. Therefore, this has greatly influenced the selection of new cabinet members and made the task of forming a cabinet even more difficult. The direct cause of the current political turmoil is the dispute between Hamada and Terauchi, but the underlying cause is that both sides have violated basic political creeds. Therefore, the general public is deeply concerned that the future cabinet will be more right-leaning than before. The financial community is eager to continue respecting parliamentary politics and to create a strong cabinet based on the parliament. The military seems unlikely to agree with this wish. This morning, the voices calling for Konoe Fumimaro to be the next prime minister were the loudest, followed by Ugaki Kazushige. Because the military recognizes that this is a very intense conflict with political parties, the only way to consolidate its position is to organize a new party. In this political transformation, the mediation of the navy is the strongest driving force to avoid the dissolution of the parliament. The resignation of the entire cabinet instead of just dissolution of the parliament is due in no small part to the efforts of Naval Minister Nagano. The differences of opinion between the army and the navy are a concern for some people and are also a factor in observing the Japanese political situation. Although the parliament has been spared dissolution for now, the dissolution of the parliament will eventually be a condition for the military to support the new cabinet. After the dissolution of the parliament, the existing political parties will disintegrate, and the organization of a new party will be an important task for the new cabinet. The size of the new party will depend on the extent of the new prime minister's prestige. Konoe issued a statement today, saying that the Hirota cabinet's failure to last was expected, but it was unexpected that such a political change would occur during the parliamentary season. The individuals organizing the new cabinet should not only take the intentions of the military as their guiding principle, but also respect parliamentary politics. However, respecting parliamentary politics and respecting existing political parties are two different things and cannot be confused. The new cabinet should have a new party as its foundation. In conclusion, Konoe said in his statement that because his health has not recovered, he is unwilling to become prime minister. This provides a glimpse into the future political trends. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)

### Ugaki Kazushige

### Military Expresses Hope

New Cabinet Should Have Awareness of the Times, Cooperate with One Heart to Develop National Fortunes

[Tokyo] The army believes that it has become a tradition for the incoming army minister to present conditions to the new prime minister when forming a cabinet, but if the prime minister does not have a correct understanding of the times, no matter how harsh the conditions are, it will not be possible to realize them. The facts have proven this. Therefore, the next cabinet does not intend to make conditions. However, the cabinet organizer should grasp a correct understanding of the times and be a shrewd and capable person. If this is the case, the army will trust him with all its spirit. The army minister does not intend to make any political statements, but will focus on military affairs. As for cabinet members, it does not matter whether they are members of a party or not, as long as they have a correct understanding of the times, and the army does not oppose such people. (Alliance News dispatch on the 24th)

[Tokyo] The navy has avoided all discussions about the political situation. However, in view of the serious international situation at the moment, especially in the first year without treaties, it hopes that a strong cabinet that is unified across the country and brings together the best talents will be established quickly. Political parties and the people of the country must recognize the extreme seriousness of the situation, be humble and open-minded, put the country first, and work together to deal with it in order to advance the national fortunes and promote national prestige, and to be loyal to the monarch and the country. As for the successor to Naval Minister Nagano, it can only be predicted after it is known who the next cabinet organizer is. It is widely speculated that Admiral Suetsugu Nobumasu or Vice Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa will become the new naval minister. (Alliance News dispatch on the 24th)

[Tokyo] It is rumored that Naval Minister Nagano's actions in this coup have created some estrangement between the army and the navy. The head of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Section, Ishimoto, in view of this, invited Kohina, the head of the Navy Ministry's First Military Affairs Section, and others to gather for a meal at the Kojimachi Bintei at noon on the 24th for a heart-to-heart discussion. As a result, they believed that at this critical moment, the spread of such rumors was regrettable for the close-knit military and that the liaison between the two sides should be strengthened to try to break through the crisis. After much discussion, the meeting ended at 2:30 p.m. (Alliance News dispatch on the 24th)

### Tokyo Newspaper Criticizes Hirota for Incompetence

[Tokyo] Most newspaper editorials this morning praised the Hirota cabinet's resignation as an appropriate action, but not a few still criticized the Hirota cabinet's incompetence and the measures it took that led to the current political changes. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)

### Political and Civil Parties Observe the Political Situation and Its Evolution

Hoping to Realize a National Unity Cabinet; Determined to Thoroughly Implement Established Policies

[Tokyo] The Seiyukai and Minseito parties are adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards the resignation of the Hirota Cabinet, observing the evolution of the political situation. It is still difficult to predict who will receive the imperial mandate. If the political parties believe the successor Prime Minister is a person they can assist, they will proceed to assist. Furthermore, if they are requested to join the cabinet, they must respond. However, if their claims cannot be accommodated and cooperation with the political parties is rejected, they will proceed with the premise of being an independent opposition party. In reality, the political parties are paying close attention to the situation of being excluded from forming a cabinet. However, it seems difficult to avoid dissolving the parliament regardless of which cabinet appears, and they seem to have realized this. (24th Associated Press dispatch)

[Tokyo] The Seiyukai held a general affairs meeting inside and outside the Diet at 2 p.m. on the 24th to discuss the party's attitude toward the current situation. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to consistently adhere to the established policies of the party convention declaration and the president's speech, with a national-first attitude. They will maintain the above attitude as before, observe the situation quietly, and respond to the new cabinet. The opinions of the colleagues have reached a consensus, and the secretary-general immediately reported the above situation to President Suzuki. (24th Associated Press dispatch)

[Tokyo] In order to clarify the party's attitude towards the new cabinet, the Minseito held a general affairs meeting inside and outside the Diet at the party headquarters at 2 p.m. on the 24th. As a result of the discussion, a general meeting of Diet members was held at 5 p.m. to formally decide on the regulations. It was briefly stated that overcoming the current difficulties is an urgent task. They hope to realize a cabinet of national unity with harmony between military and civilian officials in order to establish the foundation of the nation and eliminate the dismal atmosphere, etc. (24th Kokumin Shimbun dispatch)

### Paris Newspapers Discuss the Japanese Political Situation

Brewing Military Dictatorship; The Future Does Not Allow for Optimism

[Paris] Regarding the news of the resignation of the Hirota Cabinet in Japan, the newspapers here all consider the nature of the situation to be serious. The centralist newspaper "La République" stated, "What the military department of that country will do in the future is the crux of the problem. As far as we know, the Japanese military department is extremely radical, and its intention is to obtain a leading position in the new cabinet, otherwise it will not hesitate to instigate a coup. This point is almost beyond doubt." The communist newspaper "L'Humanité" stated, "The Hirota Cabinet has submitted its resignation under popular pressure. The actions of the military department are unknown. If the military department wants to establish a military fascist dictatorship, it is preparing to fight externally, which is not tolerated by the Japanese people. Even the bourgeoisie political parties of that country know their responsibilities for this trend and must resist it to prevent the Japanese parliament from repeating the mistakes of the German Reichstag. As for the general public's feelings about the Japanese political situation, it is believed that the policies advocated by the military department's key figure, former Minister of the Army General Araki, and the resigned Minister of the Army General Terauchi's faction, will cause disaster for that country. In short, the conflict between the military department and the political parties will not only have a significant impact on the future policies of that country, but the strength of the anti-fascist People's Front of that country will also be further strengthened. It can be asserted." The centralist newspaper "Le Petit Journal" stated that the Japanese political turmoil is extremely serious and that "no cabinet can be expected to last." As for the reasons for this political turmoil, there are many, such as the anti-communist agreement between Germany and Japan, the threat of Japanese fascist soldiers, and the increase in budget expenditures, all of which are related to this political turmoil. One of the main reasons is that the two major political parties of that country are willing to pay any price to curb the threat of military dictatorship. The moderate newspaper "Le Journal" stated, "The Japanese military dictatorship faction and politicians are now openly fighting each other. It is still unknown who will win the fight, but it is probably not easy to establish a compromise plan." The right-wing newspaper "Le Figaro" stated that after the Japanese Emperor listens to the opinions of elder statesman Saionji, he will be able to select appropriate people to form a new cabinet. "However, if the military department refuses to recommend a successor Minister of the Army, then the cabinet will not be able to be formed. In other words, the key to the Japanese political situation is really in the hands of the military department, that's all." (24th Havas dispatch)

### Impact on the Market

[Tokyo] On the 23rd, the stock market was closed on Saturday afternoon, and the impact of the cabinet's resignation was not fully reflected. The atmosphere in the morning hoped that the compromise work would be effective, and the selling situation changed. New Toa stocks rose by 4 yen, and other stocks were also bought in. However, after receiving the news of the general resignation, the atmosphere suddenly deteriorated. It is expected that the market on the 25th will inevitably experience major fluctuations. In particular, the attitude of the army is tough, and there is much concern about how the new cabinet will appear. Perhaps the degree of fluctuation will expand. The cotton yarn and raw silk markets have considerable fluctuations, and the overall situation has deteriorated. (24th Associated Press dispatch)

### Russian Counter-Revolutionary Case Finalized

Seventeen Defendants Sentenced to Death

[Moscow] Seventeen former government officials have been sentenced to death today for treason, including political commentator Radek and former ambassador to the United Kingdom Sokolnikov. All the defendants pleaded guilty, admitting that they had secretly plotted with Trotsky, who had fled overseas, to overthrow the Soviet Russian government, and were involved with Germany, Poland, Japan, China, the United States, and other countries. The most noteworthy points are as follows: ㊀ Anti-Soviet letters were smuggled into Russia in the soles of spy shoes; ㊁ There was a secret order to assassinate Stalin; ㊂ There was a secret plan to cede Sakhalin Island to Japan so that Japan could have a source of oil in the event of a Japanese-American war. The government also claimed that Trotsky had allowed Germany to assist Germany in conquering the Danube River and the Balkan countries if he returned to Russia and took power. It was also said that Mr. Trotsky had sent a letter to Radek in mid-December of the previous year, willing to cede the provinces along the Songhua River to Japan and Ukraine to Germany. (23rd Kokumin Shimbun dispatch)

[Moscow] During the open trial of former senior Soviet Russian officials in court today, Mr. Radek, a famous Soviet Russian journalist and author, confessed that we decided to either abandon everything or kill all the leaders from Stalin downwards in order to create a coup. According to this trial, there are a total of seventeen defendants, and Mr. Lai is also one of them. All of them have pleaded guilty and are now awaiting sentencing, with the possibility of the death penalty. The biggest crime committed by the defendants is participating in a conspiracy orchestrated by Mr. Trotsky to collude with Germany and Japan to sabotage the Soviet system. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Mexico City The Military Court of the Supreme Court of Moscow is currently trying the counter-revolutionary "Parallel Center" case and has ordered the arrest of anti-cadre leader Trotsky and his son Sedov for interrogation. Trotsky and his son were previously charged during the first counter-revolutionary case in August of last year. After hearing the news of the re-arrest, he was not surprised. Trotsky firmly denied the claim by the military court of that country that the defendant Radek had suggested concluding an alliance treaty with Germany and Japan, saying, "There is nothing more absurd than the fact that I allied with Hitler to control the Soviet Union and the countries of the Danube River basin, and allied with Japanese militarists to control China and the Soviet Union. There is no room for belief." I broke off relations with Radek in 1928. "Why can't I treat him as a confidant? Zinoviev, Kamenev, Smirnov, and others are more reliable and responsible than Radek. Why is there no mention of my plan to split the Soviet Union?" As for Romo, he is said to have been the liaison between myself and Radek. I have never met this person. (23rd Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Ship Searched Japan Protests to Russia

Unsatisfactory Results

[Moscow] Japanese Ambassador to Soviet Russia Shigemitsu Aoi personally went to the Soviet Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to protest the action of the Soviet Russian border authorities who boarded two Japanese ships anchored in Vladivostok on January 19 without permission. However, the results were not satisfactory. According to official announcements, Soviet Russian Eastern Minister Kozlovsky told Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu that the Japanese side had no legitimate reason to protest this matter, because several Soviet Russian ships had been detained by the Japanese in a certain Japanese harbor and subjected to unwarranted harassment. Moreover, the materials found on the Japanese ship Siberia Maru proved that the captain of the ship had committed a crime of violating the law. (24th Reuters dispatch)

### League of Nations Council Meeting Discusses the French-Turkish Dispute

British Representative Mediates; A Basis for Compromise is Established Between the Two Sides

[Geneva] The League of Nations Council held a meeting today to discuss the resolution of the Alexandretta and Danzig issues, and significant progress has been made. During a meeting between the French and Turkish representatives this morning, British Foreign Secretary Eden suddenly joined the meeting. At the request of both parties, Mr. Eden made every effort to mediate so that the two countries could reach a satisfactory resolution on the future administrative disputes in Alexandretta. Although this has not yet been achieved, the goal is getting closer. France is now willing to obtain a permanent solution. The opinion of the Turkish side is that if the Sanjak and Alexandretta, which were conditionally ceded according to the post-war treaty, cannot obtain independence, then only a temporary agreement can be made at present so that it can be revised in the future. The Special Committee for Considering the Danzig Issue has agreed in principle today, and experts are now drafting the details. It is hoped that the issue can be included in the agenda of the Council meeting on Monday, which is sufficient to prove that there are no major obstacles to the issue. It is now believed that the new agreement will stipulate the appointment of another Commissioner stationed in Danzig and recognize the authority of the League of Nations over Danzig within a more limited scope. (23rd Reuters dispatch)

### General Göring Completes His Mission

Departs Italy and Returns to Berlin

[Rome] General Göring, a confidant of German leader Hitler, met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for two hours today and has completed his mission to reciprocate Italy's visit. According to an official communiqué, today's talks included various issues discussed at the previous meeting. It is believed that Italy's reply to the United Kingdom's proposal not to interfere in the Spanish Civil War was agreed upon during the two people's meeting, and the final draft was made. The German side said that General Göring's intention to visit for a week has achieved all the purposes of this reciprocation. The general public believes that General Göring's intention was to inquire about the meaning of the British-Italian Mediterranean Agreement and whether the agreement will weaken the cooperation between Germany and Italy, and to inquire about Italy's views on the Spanish Civil War and how to respond to the United Kingdom's efforts not to interfere. It is believed that regarding the first point, Mr. Mussolini has given General Göring a guarantee, and the two politicians agreed to take positive steps to prevent the victory of the Spanish Reds.

### The Center of Madrid is Heavily Bombed

Bustling Areas Reduced to Rubble; Corpses Scattered Everywhere, Shocking

Madrid The central area of Madrid and most of the outside of the city were heavily bombed for several hours today and suffered great damage. The bombing was the most violent since the siege began eleven weeks ago. The number of deaths is still unknown. At 6 p.m., several shells landed in the center of the city, causing severe damage to several commercial skyscrapers built of reinforced concrete. More than 60 shells landed in the working-class district of Delergas in the southwest of the capital, and many of the local huts were completely destroyed. Madrid's Gran Vía was littered with rubble. The telephone exchange headquarters of the sixteen-story building is located on the street. After hearing the sound of artillery, people took all their belongings and fled the city.

### Important Speech by the French Prime Minister

The Entire Peace is Indivisible; The Key Lies Entirely in Germany's Attitude

Lyon, France French Prime Minister Blum recently delivered an important speech at a People's Front banquet here, in which he discussed domestic and foreign policy issues. The main points are as follows: "I believe that all methods, all those that are a matter of haggling, should not be proposed to Germany. France has always known how to love itself, and knows how to respect the people of other countries." Economic cooperation and the organization of peace are inherently related and have an indelible relationship. One of the main methods of organizing peace is to curb the arms race. France can cooperate with Germany economically, but who would be willing to help a country economically if it has an adverse impact as a result? Only the following suggestions should be made: ㊀ The People's Front advocates peace and has always been very active. In fact, it has proven that it can guarantee France's interests and maintain France's dignity. ㊁ The claims of France and Germany are completely different. Germany advocates bilateral negotiations, while France advocates a comprehensive solution to European problems. ㊂ The theory of security and "peace is indivisible" advocated by France is inseparable from the policy advocated by France "with the League of Nations as the cornerstone." ㊃ I believe that the key to European peace lies entirely in Germany's hands. This is consistent with what British Foreign Secretary Eden said in the House of Commons a few days ago. ㊄ France will never haggle with Germany. ㊅ German leader Hitler's proposal for peace should be consistent with his words and deeds, but if France and Germany cannot compromise politically, there is no room for economic compromise.

The Prime Minister concluded by saying that France's desire for peace is beyond doubt. What the French people seek most is nothing else but to unswervingly maintain the entire indivisible peace. Once peace is unattainable, the people will have no bread to eat and will risk losing their freedom. Therefore, the People's Front takes maintaining peace as its creed. (24th Havas dispatch)

### British Trade Minister Visits the White House

Wide Range of Topics Discussed

[Washington] British Trade Minister Runciman, who arrived here from London yesterday, first met with U.S. Secretary of State Hull today, and then went to the White House to be a guest of President Roosevelt. Members of Congress are paying close attention to Mr. Runciman's actions, especially since Mr. Runciman has admitted that in addition to other matters, he also intends to discuss the issue of U.S. neutrality with President Rooseveldt. According to general opinion, it is believed that Mr. Runciman may see that although the U.S. public's sentiment towards neutrality is quite strong, it has now been adjusted by realism and is tending to ease. Therefore, proposals that the United States must voluntarily destroy its export trade in order to avoid being caught in the whirlpool of war will naturally reduce enthusiasm. (23rd Reuters dispatch)

[Washington] According to news today, President Roosevelt's talks with British Trade Minister Runciman at the end of this week will exchange views on promoting Anglo-American understanding. The White House said that there are many issues to be discussed, indicating that the unemployment problem or the UK's methods of dealing with unemployment will also be discussed. According to well-informed sources, this time Mr. Runciman's visit to the White House may discuss the classification of the arms industry and how to absorb workers in the industry when arms manufacturing is slack. However, the talks have no definite goals, nor are they preparing to hold a formal currency stabilization meeting or discuss commercial agreements. The President only believes that the talks may further clarify the truth of the world economic situation. However, according to authoritative sources, the United Kingdom is very concerned about the U.S. neutrality plan, fearing that if the United Kingdom has a conflict with other countries, the U.S. neutrality plan may prevent the United Kingdom from purchasing U.S. raw materials. Therefore, the neutrality issue and the Anglo-American commercial treaty issue may be discussed. (23rd Kokumin Shimbun dispatch)

### Italy's Current Mediterranean Policy

The Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement is the Beginning; Improving Relations with the Balkan Countries

[Rome] General observers recently stated that Italy's current Mediterranean policy began with the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement, followed by joining the Montreux Convention to eliminate past grievances with Turkey (Turkey was also one of the countries that imposed sanctions on Italy, and recently recognized the Italian Empire in fact), and finally, it should improve relations with Greece and cooperate with Yugoslavia. Only then will Italy's Mediterranean policy be completed. Regarding the relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia, since the League of Nations General Assembly revoked the sanctions against Italy in July of last year, Italy has been conducting commercial negotiations with Yugoslavia. On November 1 of last year, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini pointed out in an important speech in Milan that the atmosphere between Italy and Yugoslavia had improved significantly, and said, "A new foundation of friendly relations can be established between the two countries due to the existence of moral, political, economic, and appropriate conditions." Some parties believe that Italy and Yugoslavia may sign a diplomatic document to confirm the friendly relations between the two countries. (22nd Havas dispatch)

[Paris] France hopes that after the signing of the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Agreement, similar negotiations can be conducted between Rome and Paris to restore the friendship between France and Italy that was broken by the Abyssinian War. However, government officials also admit that this matter will be more difficult than Anglo-Italian coordination. Newspapers critical of the government regretted that France was not invited to participate in this Anglo-Italian negotiation. Mrs. Tabuy also said, "The situation is becoming critical, and I hope that France can support the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement and conduct negotiations with Italy as soon as possible."

### Severe Floods in the Midwestern United States

Unprecedented in Fifty Years

Property Losses of Millions of Dollars; Hundreds of Thousands Displaced

Cincinnati There are now a total of twelve states experiencing a major flood that has not been seen since 1884. Many people have drowned, and property losses will amount to millions of dollars. No fewer than 200,000 residents have been displaced along the Ohio River, and hundreds of miles of the Mississippi River basin have also been flooded, leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. At the same time, the water in Cincinnati, Louisville, and Memphis is still rising. The three places have a total of 2.5 million residents. The water level of the Ohio River has reached 72 feet 5 inches, breaking the previous record. This is 20 feet higher than the flood level. Some streets in Cincinnati are 18 feet deep in water. The displaced people have experienced influenza and serious infectious diseases. Police in the disaster area have been ordered to kill anyone who robs. When the prison in Frankfort, Kentucky, was flooded, 19 prisoners tried to escape, but after the guards opened fire, they were all arrested again. (23rd Reuters dispatch)

### Riots Occur in the U.S. Maritime Workers' Strike

Labor-Management Negotiations Remain Deadlocked

[San Francisco] Riots broke out again in San Francisco's financial district today due to the maritime workers' strike. It is said that the rioters were still the dockworkers who had three street battles yesterday. Because a workers' group that opposed the strike wanted to sell printed materials against radical elements in the market today, the two sides clashed immediately. People in the skyscrapers on both sides watched from the windows. Fortunately, the police suppressed the riots on the spot, and there were no serious injuries. About a dozen people were arrested. As for the strike negotiations, they are still deadlocked. The chairman of the shipping association, Pland, also said that the time for negotiations has passed, because the employers have made extreme concessions. San Francisco Mayor Rossi invited local municipal officials to a meeting on the 26th to discuss the strike issue. Both labor and management were invited to send representatives to attend and explain the crux of the problem that cannot be resolved. It is said that the municipal authorities can understand which side is hindering the solution, because the authorities cannot sit idly by and watch the strike, which has lasted for nearly three months, continue indefinitely.

### Overview of Red Tea Production and Sales in Hunan and Hubei Over the Past Year

International Market Seized, Exports Plummeting, Market Prices Gradually Declining, Merchants Suffering Losses

Hankou Telegraph. Red tea from Hunan and Hubei has always been a major product for international sales, greatly impacting the local economy. However, in recent years, due to the seizure of the international market, sales have decreased daily, and market prices have gradually declined, showing a trend of irreversible decline. According to detailed investigations by relevant parties, although production increased last year compared to the previous year, sales actually decreased. This indicates that this sole export product, red tea, is still struggling for survival in the process of collapse. Regarding production and sales, last year's red tea from Hunan and Hubei was delayed until June 1st due to the impact of spring rain. The largest production areas in Hubei province are Yichang, Yangloudong, and Niejiashi. Hunan province has a wider production area, including Anhua, Taoyuan, Gaoqiao, Xiangyin, Yongfeng, Liling, Loudi, Lantian, Pingjiang, Changshou Street, and Liuyang. The total annual production was 188,425 boxes, an increase of 46,772 boxes compared to the previous year (1935) production of 141,653 boxes. Anhua had the highest production, followed by Lantian. As for sales markets, which used to hold an important position in the international trade market, they have been gradually decreasing in recent years due to the impact of foreign tea dumping. Last year, the British market was seized by foreign teas from India, Ceylon, and Japan, resulting in a slump in Chinese tea exports. As a result, British firms in Hankou such as Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, Reiss & Co., Ilbert & Co., Dodwell & Co., Gibb, Livingston & Co., Bradley & Co., the Russian firm Assistorg, the German firm Carlowitz & Co., and the German-Chinese Trading Company all had very weak imports. Market transactions were intermittent. Until the end of the year, the banking and finance industries closed their accounts, credit tightened, and the market situation deteriorated. The total annual sales, including purchases by Shanghai, Shanxi merchants, and various tea firms and shops in Hankou, amounted to 141,382 boxes. As of the end of last year, after offsetting production and sales, there were still 47,043 boxes unsold. Regarding market prices, when the new tea started to be sold last year, Hankou merchants rushed to the production areas to place orders, causing production prices to rise sharply. After the tea was transported to Hankou, based on the aforementioned foreign tea dumping factors in the international trade market, foreign firms initially hesitated and observed, then suppressed prices for absorption. Generally, merchants felt that there was no profit to be made and held their prices without selling. Later, due to the heavy burden of warehouse rent and monthly interest, in order to avoid huge losses, they had to sell at reduced prices. However, there were already many who suffered losses. For example, merchants in Lantian, Anhua, Gaoqiao, and Taoyuan were unwilling to sell when the market price exceeded 50 yuan when new tea was launched. By the end of the year, even when the price was reduced to 37 yuan, there were no buyers. Secondly, merchants in Yangloudong, Niejiashi, Changshou Street, Pingjiang, and Liuyang also suffered slight losses. Only the tea sold by Yichang merchants was of particularly good quality and sold for a maximum price of 91 yuan, earning considerable profits. In addition, tea fragments and flower tea once sold for more than ten to twenty yuan, but now flower tea only sells for a few yuan. According to the above, last year, except for the Yichang merchants who made a slight profit, all other tea merchants suffered losses. (January 21st)

### Japanese-Owned Opium Dens in Xiamen to Close in Stages

Reduced to 250 Next Month, Then Reduced by 50 Every Six Months; Japanese Opium Addicts Given Two Years

Xiamen Telegraph. Fujian Province has rigorously implemented opium prohibition for two years. There are no more opium seedlings in the entire province, and the unified control of sales and consumption is being gradually implemented. However, there are still opium dens in Xiamen, all operated by Japanese and Taiwanese. Originally, there were 400 dens. Since the strict implementation of opium prohibition, the number of people quitting has been increasing daily, so the opium dens' business has gradually declined and decreased. Recently, there are only about 300 dens remaining. This year, the provincial government negotiated with the Japanese Consul-General in Fuzhou to ban the Japanese and Taiwanese opium dens in Fuzhou and Xiamen and ordered them to close in stages. The Japanese Consul-General has agreed in principle. In Xiamen, the municipal government negotiated with the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, requesting a reduction to 80 dens, or at most 100 dens. The Japanese Consul-General replied that reducing the number of dens was not difficult, but those who lost their jobs after the closures would have no way to make a living and would need to be given conversion funds, otherwise there might be an impact on public order. As a result of the negotiations, it was decided to reduce the number of dens in stages. It was agreed that by February 1st, the number would be reduced to 250, and then reduced by 50 every six months until completely closed. China's opium prohibition period is scheduled to completely eradicate opium in six years, and there are still three years remaining. Therefore, the Japanese opium dens are also scheduled to be completely closed in stages within three years, starting from now. However, the 50 dens reduced each period will be ordered to merge with the remaining opium dens. The last period of 50 dens will operate for six months, and then be completely closed when the period expires. After that, opium distributors ("zhuang jia" opium dealers) will be charged a conversion fee of two yuan per month, secondary distributors (wholesale distributors) will be charged one yuan per month, and opium dens of third distributors will have their monthly license fee reduced from the original five yuan to three yuan. This three yuan will be saved as a conversion fee. The above income will be used for the conversion of those who lost their jobs after the opium dens closed. The Japanese Consulate in Xiamen has also ordered the Japanese opium addicts in Xiamen to register with the Taiwanese Resident Association and be required to quit within two years. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously ordered Japanese opium addicts to quit this year. The Japanese Consul in Xiamen specially requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Japanese residents to extend the deadline to quit within two years. (January 22nd)

### Cheerful Sales of Chaozhou Tangerines

This Year's Crop Increases by About Half Compared to Previous Years, Exports Worth About Four Million Yuan

Shantou Telegraph. Chaozhou tangerines are a famous specialty fruit of China. Their color is as red as cinnabar, and their taste is as sweet as honey. Around the winter solstice, large quantities are packed in wooden barrels and exported to major ports at home and abroad. The tangerine peel is tangerine peel used in traditional Chinese medicine. This winter, with the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, soldiers on the front lines suffering from colds, chills, and coughs can hold a piece of dried candied tangerine peel in their mouths to dissolve phlegm and smooth their breathing. Therefore, not only are Chaozhou tangerines selling well this winter, but even dried tangerine peels have increased in price to 33 yuan per hundred pounds. The main sales market for Chaozhou tangerines is Southeast Asia. Each tangerine weighs two to three taels, and the flesh separates naturally. Ten years ago, Japanese agricultural experts purchased tangerine seedlings from Chaozhou and Shantou and transplanted them in large quantities to Kaohsiung and other places in Taiwan. Thanks to diligent efforts, there was a harvest two years ago. The shape is larger than Chaozhou tangerines, but due to different weather and soil conditions, Taiwanese tangerines mostly have yellow peels without vermilion red color, taste bland and slightly sour, and the flesh does not separate naturally. The peels are also useless. Therefore, Taiwanese tangerines only have the appearance of Chaozhou tangerines. Two years ago, they were able to somewhat impact Chaozhou tangerines, but consumers can judge color and taste. Last year, Taiwanese tangerines had already retreated in the face of competition and had to be left on the trees until March or April of the following spring, waiting for new green tangerines to appear on the branches, and when Chaozhou tangerines left the market, Taiwanese tangerines were then harvested and marketed. This shows that they cannot compete with Chaozhou tangerines.

Chaozhou tangerines are uniquely blessed. Along the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway line, tangerine orchards stretch for hundreds of miles. In Chaoan County alone, five years ago, there were already 70,000 mu of fertile land planted with tangerines, with 720,000 tangerine-producing trees. Later, due to root rot, trees were planted as they died. Responsible parties have been actively improving the trees, and the government has also announced a ban on the export of tangerine seedlings. The price of Chaozhou tangerines (per 100-pound barrel) was 10 to 12 yuan last year, but now it is 14 to 16 yuan. The main destinations for shipments to the north are Shanghai and Tianjin, and the main destinations for shipments to the south are Singapore and Thailand. Every day, ships leave with tangerines, and the tangerine boats line up like clouds at the customs. Each ship carries about three to five thousand barrels, continuously. To date, more than 150,000 barrels have been exported, and including tangerines still being picked in the orchards and those on the river, there is at least half as many again as last year. The price is also higher than last year. Therefore, it is estimated that the total value of this year's Chaozhou tangerine exports will reach 4 million yuan, which will greatly benefit the rural economy.

### Steamboat Company Dispute Leads to Injury

The steamboat company Dada of Shaobo in Jiangdu's Seventh District and the steamboat company Xin Yonglong have been in dispute for a long time over competing for the prison-Shaobo route, and have been attacking each other. Unexpectedly, at 1:00 am on the 21st, when Dada's small steamboat, which had arrived in Shaobo from the prison, was docked at the Jiangtai Pier, Xu Laoda of Xin Yonglong's Xin Yuan boat suddenly directed Hu Desheng and others to rush to Dada's ticket office to attack, injuring the tea server Shao Sanhang, Rong Lin, and Liu Shiqing of the Dongya Hotel, and damaging items and hanging signs. Dada's manager Huang Daosheng immediately informed the Shaobo Water Public Security Team, who arrived at the scene to suppress the situation. The injured leader was arrested, and the Western doctor Liang Daoan was asked to diagnose the injuries. A report was filed and transferred by the team to the Jiangdu District Procuratorate for investigation. On the 22nd, Xin Yonglong Company also carried the injured Wang and Li to the District Procuratorate, where the injuries were verified and both sides were ordered to return. However, Dada, dissatisfied with Xin Yonglong's manager Huang Zhennan leading Wu Guanghe, Hu Desheng, and Jin to commit assault and injury, plans to continue the lawsuit and file a claim for damages for the lost items.

### Smallpox Epidemic in Various Parts of Qingjiang

The weather has been warm and there has been little rain and snow since winter, resulting in the spread of infectious diseases in various places. Recently, in the northern townships of Huai'an, the northern townships of Huaiyin, and the southwestern townships of Lianshui, there has been a severe smallpox epidemic. Infants who contract the disease are often incurable, and adults who contract the disease have no hope of recovery. The most frightening thing is that even infants who have been vaccinated with cowpox and adults who have had smallpox once can be infected again and develop smallpox for the second time, as is the case with a certain person who is currently being treated at Ren'ci Hospital. Fortunately, since the 15th of this month, it has been snowing and raining heavily, and it has not cleared up even on the 20th, so the scope of the infection may not expand.

### Anqing Plans to Establish Paper Mills and Other Factories

The Anhui Construction Department believes that Anhui Province is a paper-producing region, such as Jing County, Guangde County, and Xuancheng County, which produce papermaking raw materials. Xuancheng paper, in particular, has long been famous. It is urgent to study and improve paper production to meet social needs and maintain the inherent rural sideline industry. It is planned to temporarily establish a paper mill in Xuancheng or Guangde with a setup fee of 8,000 yuan, a working capital of 10,000 yuan, and recurring expenses of 9,012 yuan. The raw materials will be bamboo, rice straw, and paper mulberry bark from Anhui and Ningguo. Small-scale improvements to papermaking methods will be made first, and rural households in various counties and townships will be guided. The department also believes that Anhui's industry is underdeveloped and handicrafts are relatively common. Xuancheng paper, bamboo mats, and wool blankets are all quite famous. Regarding Xuancheng paper, plans have been made to establish a factory to improve production, but workers in various places still adhere to old methods and do not know how to improve bamboo mats and wool blankets, resulting in extremely sluggish sales. Therefore, it is planned to: (1) establish small-scale bamboo mat and wool blanket factories in Shucheng and Hao County to improve production; (2) establish temporary training classes to train workers and apprentices; (3) introduce new patterns; (4) establish financial institutions (such as agricultural and industrial lending agencies and credit cooperatives) in areas with special products to provide low-interest loans; (5) order various places to organize sales cooperatives; (6) exempt from taxes when exporting from the province; (7) reduce truck transportation costs to engage in improved production of bamboo mats and wool blankets.

### Industrial and Commercial Football Match Held at the Municipal First Stadium Yesterday

Among the various groups this year, the Shenzi group has the highest level of football skills, but in reality, the Jindie and Huanan teams are the best. Yesterday's match was held, the weather was rainy and the ground was slippery, but there were still seven or eight hundred spectators. After the start of the match, Jindie had more opportunities to attack. Huanan's strength lies in the five forwards' connection, short passes, and agility, while Jindie has harder feet and a stronger inside defense. The muddy ground made running difficult, and the effectiveness of passing and connection was greatly reduced. Therefore, in terms of weather and geographical advantages, Huanan seemed to be at a slight disadvantage. In the 15th minute, Jindie's center forward Xu Buyun got the ball and shot directly, scoring the first goal. After that, mud and rain flew and the atmosphere was tense, but no goals were scored. In the second half, Huanan seized the opportunity to move. Left forward Yao Guanfan scored with one kick, and center forward Wang Cuixing shot and scored, tying the score. After that, there was no progress, and the spectators all thought that the result would be a tie. Unexpectedly, two minutes before the end of the match, Jindie's central defender Xu Jingcheng shot another goal, making the score two to one, and Jindie won.

Economic Special Issue

### The Economic Significance of Japan's Strengthened Foreign Exchange Control

— Mo Yin

Japan's entry into 1937 was marked by the extraordinary event of foreign exchange control, which is indeed very significant. The true meaning of this event lies not only in its potential impact on the Chinese market but also in allowing us to see more clearly the economic vulnerabilities of Japan. According to the Ministry of Finance's order to control foreign exchange on January 8th, those who need to settle accounts through foreign exchange for imported goods must first obtain government permission and a letter of credit before engaging in foreign exchange transactions. At the same time, when Japanese banks sell yen in foreign markets, they must also be subject to government control and are not allowed to buy and sell freely. Therefore, it is evident that the main purpose of this strengthened foreign exchange control is to maintain the stability of the yen, and the means of control lies in controlling Japan's import trade.

Why does Japan need to strengthen foreign exchange management to control import trade? Is it, as Finance Minister Baba stated, a temporary emergency measure to prevent speculative trading of the yen? No, it is by no means a temporary measure that occurs by chance; it is a significant change with serious economic implications.

What is the underlying economic reason for Japan's strengthened foreign exchange control this time? In simple terms, I believe it is:

Firstly, it is the result of gradually decreasing exports, greatly increasing imports, a continuous increase in import surplus, and the deterioration of foreign trade. Regarding this point, we only need to look at the table below to understand it at a glance (Table from the Asahi Shimbun, January 10th. In units of 1,000 yen, where the symbol ▲ indicates an import surplus).

The main reason for this obvious and gradually worsening phenomenon in foreign trade is the relatively and absolutely rapid increase in imports. In particular, it is due to the large increase in imports of important industrial raw materials such as iron, cotton, wool, heavy oil, coal, and hardware. Naturally, the reason for the increase in imports of these goods is closely related to the abnormal development of Japan's military industry. Recently, due to preparations for revising tariff import tax rates and the rising prices of imported goods, it has further stimulated Japan's import frenzy, making it even more difficult to maintain trade balance. (Editor's note: In the week following the announcement of foreign exchange control, i.e., mid-January, the trade deficit was 69.72 million yen.) Conversely, on the export side, we can clearly see a stagnant phenomenon. The reason for the sluggish exports is, on the one hand, the result of strong international rejection of Japanese goods, but the important reason is probably that the rising prices of raw materials and the increasing production costs have greatly reduced the competitiveness of Japanese goods in foreign markets. Therefore, the reason for this foreign exchange control lies in suppressing rampant imports in order to alleviate the unbalanced development of trade.

Secondly, because the deterioration of trade obviously poses a risk of a sharp fall in the yen's exchange rate. Throughout last year, Japan's import trade continued to increase, and although banks tried their best to maintain the yen's price, its prices against the British pound and the US dollar plummeted to unprecedented levels at the end of last year. This is another reason why foreign exchange control could not be strengthened. Because after foreign exchange control, the use of foreign exchange funds can be more rational, and the escape of capital can also be suppressed to some extent.

Thirdly, in addition to the above two negative reasons, we should also pay attention to another positive reason. What is this positive reason? It is to reduce the import of consumer goods as much as possible through the method of foreign exchange control, so that the import of military supplies and raw materials necessary for the military industry can continue to increase. The decision of a huge military budget this year will further increase the surge in military supplies imports, which is something that everyone can predict in advance. In the process of implementing the continental policy, "cannons are more important than butter." Therefore, since Japan's export trade cannot be freely increased, it is natural to artificially suppress the import of consumer goods and use foreign exchange funds as much as possible to purchase military supplies. Therefore, we can be even more confident that the motivation for Japan's decisive implementation of foreign exchange control was prompted by domestic and international political and economic situations, and the main backbone is probably to maintain a tough foreign policy!

If our analysis is in line with the actual situation, then we can see a true meaning of Japan's strengthened foreign exchange control here: we should admit that this is a last resort in the process of Japan's economic deterioration, especially when foreign trade cannot be balanced. The primary goal of adopting this method is to find ways to temporarily maintain the yen's exchange rate in order to avoid the immediate realization of malignant inflation, so that Japan's abnormally developing economic prosperity can be barely supported; but at the same time, in this insecurity of the yen's price, it also reflects the crisis of the Japanese economy. Therefore, it can also be said that strengthening foreign exchange control is an inevitable result of a superficial boom.

Since the motivation for Japan's strengthened foreign exchange control is as described above, the focus of the problem should be shifted to whether its future results can achieve the ideal that is currently expected.

The problem is very obvious. No matter how many aspects there are to the reasons for Japan's strengthened foreign exchange control on the surface, in summary, it is not difficult for us to understand; the purpose that the Japanese authorities now intend is obviously to hope to control the balance of imported goods and regulate export trade in order to maintain the stability of foreign exchange funds, and its specific purpose is to maintain the unstable price of the yen. However, this kind of "painstaking" measure has very little practical effect on the fixity and certainty of economic laws.

A prerequisite is that in Japan's current economic development, there is a very unbalanced phenomenon between the military industry and the production of consumer goods industry. Moreover, the preparation for further expansion of the military industry has intensified this contradiction. Therefore, in fact, after foreign exchange control, it is very difficult to achieve the goal of reducing imports and increasing exports, because the imports that Japan can now restrict, in addition to some national consumables, the raw materials of other important industries, and many finished or semi-finished products, cannot be reduced at all. In particular, the commodities related to the military industry are naturally even more impossible to prevent from being imported. Therefore, the result of foreign exchange control, if you want to reduce imports and balance import and export trade, this must be a fantasy, and the authorities have already decided to implement changes in the import rate of tariffs, then domestic prices will inevitably rise sharply. In particular, the rise in the prices of commodities directly or indirectly related to imported goods and their substitutes cannot be suppressed at all. In this way, the prices of imported goods in the Japanese market will naturally also increase, and the price of goods that Japan pays to foreign countries will of course also expand accordingly, which is a shallow and obvious truth.

The hope for reducing imports is so weak. On the contrary, we cannot but worry about Japan's future regarding exports. We know that most of Japan's most important industrial raw materials, such as cotton, wool, iron, coal, oil, rubber, wood, copper, tin, flour, etc., must rely on the supply of foreign markets. Once imports are restricted, the prices of these commodities will undoubtedly continue to rise. Then the cost of industrial products will of course also increase, and at the same time, the export prices of commodities will also inevitably rise as a result. In this way, the competitiveness of Japanese goods in the international market, needless to say, will gradually decrease. At the same time, we know that the production of Japanese industry, especially the light industry, almost all depends on the international market. Once the competitiveness of exports is reduced, the inevitable result that it will bring is something that everyone can imagine: the decline of industry—the reduction and bankruptcy of production. Moreover, in the domestic market in Japan, the general price of goods is difficult to suppress its rise. Once the price of goods rises, the national consumption power will inevitably decrease accordingly. In particular, the unfolding of the scissors shape of agricultural product prices and industrial product prices is even more sufficient to cause the occurrence of large-scale surplus phenomena in domestic production in Japan.

According to the above, we can know that after strengthening foreign exchange management, the hope of reducing import surpluses is inevitably difficult to achieve. However, if the import surplus problem cannot have a good solution in the future, then what good hope is there for the balance of foreign exchange funds and the stability of the yen's price? Therefore, on the contrary, if Japan's export industry continues to shrink, the import of military industrial products will continue to increase, and there is no fundamental solution to the import surplus problem, then in the near future, a natural result will inevitably be produced. This is: the real wages of Japanese workers may be reduced again, the national living expenses will continue to rise, and the inevitable decline in the price of the yen itself.

Since Japan's method of strengthening foreign exchange management occurs on such an economic basis, it is no wonder that the Japanese financial community holds a very pessimistic attitude towards the future of the Ministry of Finance's implementation of foreign exchange management this time. Now let us quote the following paragraph as a proof.

"The authorities have recently concealed the fundamental reasons for the yen's insecurity, and only attempted to stabilize the yen price by strengthening the management of foreign exchange. Although this can be expected to have some degree of effect at present, it can never fundamentally save the softness of the yen's exchange rate. Not only that, but on the contrary, the fact that the credit foundation of the yen overseas is gradually weakening and causing shaking has already been shown. That is, the reasons why the yen's exchange rate is finally trending towards weakness are based on our country's (Japan's) position in the international political situation, the deterioration of the trade balance, the compilation of an excessively large budget, the surge in imports of cotton, wool, etc., and the rise in expected imports due to the revision of tariffs. Therefore, although this foreign exchange management can prevent unilateral import trade to some extent, it is impossible to use this to remove the foundation of yen price insecurity." (See the Economic Edition of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, January 9)

Regarding the estimate that foreign exchange management cannot prevent inflation, a passage in the criticism of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on January 9 is quite correct. He wrote: "Although foreign exchange management was originally intended to prevent inflation, because it internally promoted the rise in prices, and externally because the end result is to strengthen the decline in foreign exchange, and the reasons that cannot but promote the factors of inflation, foreign exchange control here is nothing more than falling into a decided contradiction."

In short, the fundamental reasons for the shaking of the yen's external credit foundation—the continuous influx of foreign trade and the phenomenon of fiscal expansion, etc.—if there is no way to eliminate them, then it is obvious that the result of strengthened foreign exchange management will naturally not be able to prevent the development of the yen price drop crisis, and on the contrary, perhaps things will be just like what the Asahi Shimbun said: "Nothing more than falling into a decided contradiction"!

Since the reason for Japan's foreign exchange management measures was erupted under the excessive expansion of the economy, and after foreign exchange management, there is no way to eliminate these fundamental contradictions that cannot be resolved, perhaps Finance Minister Baba's so-called "temporary measures" may only be an expectation, and it is not known, because under the current situation in Japan where it is trying its best to maintain economic prosperity with military demand, its future development may become more and more impossible to abandon foreign exchange management in the future.

In short, in order to implement the continental policy, the Japanese authorities have passed a huge military budget and are stepping up economic control, and suddenly announced such an astonishing decree, which undoubtedly reflects a further development of Japan's internal economic contradictions. In other words, this reflects the contradiction of the production boom that is not based on the expansion of national consumption power. This sudden change, in today's terms, is still an ordinary and common thing on the surface, but from the perspective of the unhealthy phenomenon of Japan's entire economic development, it may be said that this is a prelude to the eve of Japan's coming economic panic in the near future!

After Japan implemented foreign exchange control this time, many people in the country have made speculations. Most people believe that Japan's export trade to China will greatly increase in the future. I believe that in a certain period, such an estimation may be somewhat possible, but we should not ignore another more important possibility because of this, that is, Japan's attempt to win cheap raw materials from China will become more urgent. Directly and indirectly, perhaps this will further promote the deterioration of all relations between China and Japan.

All the changes in friendly countries have often had a serious impact on China in the past, and of course, the implementation of foreign exchange management will not be an exception. Therefore, I hope that the people of the country pay close attention to this issue. This article is just a small reference for readers.

### Outlook for the World Economy (Continued)

— Zhang Baiyi

Conversely, the market price of world agricultural products has been declining since 1933. For example, the Chicago wheat market price in July 1933, the highest, was US$1.16 per bushel, and in August 1934, the highest, it fell to US$1.1083, and in October 1935, the highest, it fell to US$1.0821. But after July 1936, it showed a trend of increasing all the way due to natural disasters and the preparation of war grain in various countries. By December 16, 1936, it had reached US$1.3387. The market price of Indian sacks per 100 was the highest in June 1933 at 29 rupees and a quarter, and in October 1934, the highest, it was only 26 rupees and seven-eighths, and in February 1935, the highest, it fell to 25 rupees and seven-eighths, and in September 1936, it fell to 19 rupees and thirteen-sixteenths, and in October, it increased slightly to 20 rupees and a half. The market price of Australian wool per pound was the highest in January 1934 at 40 pence, and in October 1935, the highest, it was 34 pence. By 1936, it had fallen from 33 pence and a half in July to 30 pence and a half in September. Indian cotton was 213 rupees and a half in 1932, and it fell to 167 rupees and a half in 1933, and it fell again to 157 rupees and three-quarters in 1934. In January 1935, it increased slightly to 163 rupees, and in October 1936, it fell again to 160 rupees. The spot market price of New York raw silk was the highest in 1931 at US$3.15 per pound, and it fell to US$2.15 in 1932. In 1933, it increased again to US$2.52, but in 1934, it fell into the US$2 mark and became US$1.73. In 1935, it was seen to recover to US$2.39, but in September 1936, it fell to US$1.83, but in December, it was seen to rise again. The following is a list of world major commodity market prices: (highest market price) (Table 5)

The world commodity market has a close relationship with war. In October 1935, due to the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian War, copper, lead, zinc, tin, etc. in the world suddenly increased, so the highest market prices of these commodities in 1935 were all in October. Recently in the winter of 1936, world agricultural products also showed an upward trend. Needless to say, it is certainly not a natural increase in prices, but it has the significance of preparing for the world wartime economy.

In the spring of 1937, it will generally continue to rise, because the division of the world front will develop in direct proportion to the time, and the atmosphere of war will become more intense. However, this speculative rise in commodity prices will not last for a long time; at the same time, due to the equal strength of the arms race in various countries, war may be avoided, so the rise in the market prices of these commodities will stop and gradually fall.

▲ The Movement of a Black Shadow Lying on the World Economic Structure

The world military boom promotes the function of the world economic structure, just like a hungry and thirsty person drinking poisonous alcohol. It feels infinitely comfortable for a while, but the result is ultimately to sacrifice life. It is obviously an extremely illogical action phenomenon to use the military boom to save the world economic panic. It gathers the world's financial and labor forces to build countless giant cannons, warships, military aircraft, armored vehicles, gunpowder bombs, poison gas bombs, and other military production products that cannot be eaten when hungry and cannot be clothed when cold, and at the same time hopes that the world economy will prosper immediately. Isn't it extremely contradictory? Some people say that countries such as Italy have gained extensive colonial markets due to the increase in military force, so their financial and labor forces can still be said to be productive. However, it should be known that Italy's acquisition of colonial markets is only a temporary fact at present. As mentioned earlier, these countries still need to increase more than twice the current military force in order to ensure the current established phenomenon. Therefore, it cannot be considered that the war has reached a decisive point at present, but only a part of the world war system. It can also be said to be the outpost of the world war, which is like a game of chess that is still being played in the middle, and there is still some time to wait for the final result. Therefore, even standing from the point of view of nationalism, the expansion of military force is by no means reasonable.

Originally, the composition of the world economy has a history of two thousand years. Due to the imbalance of natural resources, people must help each other in order to maintain the survival of all the people in the world. At the same time, the world economy has developed to the current stage and has become a closely connected and inseparable whole system. For example, the credit panic of the US stock exchange in 1929 became a signal of the world panic. Today, countries around the world disregard the mutual assistance and connection of the world economy, and expand their military preparations, investing half of the national finances in state-owned and private military industries, thinking that they will surely obtain the great profit of the colonial market. How do they know that the world colonial market is becoming increasingly narrow and the national industries of some countries that have been oppressed as colonial markets are rising. This road is not open. The most obvious proof is that the expansion of military preparations in various countries has not been interrupted from 1933 to the present.

To expand the scope of this theory further, the whole world consumes limited natural resources such as steel, aluminum, nickel, tungsten, salt, rubber, cotton, coal, oil, rice (military chemical acetone raw materials), etc. in "war construction". How can the world economy not be poor and how can the lives of the people of the world not be bitter? Of course, we cannot deny that in the process of the world military boom, some countries have been able to maintain a relatively stable national life due to the strong consolidation of their established strength (national defense and economic strength) and the balanced development of the military boom and the export boom (that is, exchanging exports for military expenditure); and capitalists engaged in the military industry, such as British Vicker Armstrong Ltd, French Schneider et Creusot, American Bethlehem Steel Co, Remington Arms Co·El DuPont de Nemournrs Co, German Kopp Japanese Mitsui Company and other arms tycoons, have been able to make a fortune. However, those who rely on the military boom to live a prosperous life only account for hundreds of millions of the people in the world.

Precisely because of this, a black shadow appears on the world economy. This black shadow is the appearance of the rupture of the existing world economic structure. In other words, due to the low value of labor and the high increase in the income of military industrialists, it will promote the suspension of the world's production function and even become a wedge machine for the reconstruction of the new world economic structure. But if these surplus labor forces are driven by a certain force with a spiritual policy to the existing fire line, the chaos in the world will undoubtedly be prolonged.

We only need to look at the rise in the world stock price index and the substantive decline in the world labor income index (based on the price index), and we can fully understand. (Table 6)

Remarks: Stocks = United States based on Dow Jones 1913 = 1003 France S. G. F. 1913 = 100 United Kingdom Financial Times 1926 = 100; Germany Slatist-Reichsamt 1924-26 = 100; Japan The Orient Economist 1913 = 100. Silver = British London & Cambridge 1924.12 = 100. American N. I. G. B. 1923 = 100. Japan Bank of Japan 1925 = 100. Prices = American Dun & Bradstreet + 1913 = 100; Japan The Oreintal Economist 1913 = 100; United Kingdom The Economist. 1927 = 100.

Looking at the above table, world stock prices have risen as a whole except for France. France has been particularly low due to the depression of the export industry, but there is no reason for the market price of its military industry stocks to fall. The US this year's October 227.0 increased by more than double compared to 108.6 in 1933; the UK's September 133.9 increased by 43.1% compared to 90.8 in 1933; Germany's September 100.1 increased by 32.8% compared to 67.3 in 1933; Japan's October 107.9 increased by 11.9% compared to 96.0 in 1933. However, the world's industrial and mining industry, the US's September 94 this year, increased by 27% compared to 67 in 1933, but at the same time, prices increased by 23.9%, so the cost of living index increased from 74.8 in 1933 to 85.9 in September 1936; the UK's September 98 this year increased by only 4% compared to 94 in 1933, while prices increased by 11.6% at the same time; Japan fell from 85 in 1933 to 80 in August 1936, while prices increased by 32% during the same period.

### Wholesale Price Index Table for Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States

Due to the decline in world industrial and mining industry, the widespread strike movement in the world in 1936 was intensified. However, due to the continued absorption of labor by the military boom, the increase in the employed world gained relative peace. But when the world military boom collapses due to the bankruptcy of world fiscal expansion, the surplus laborers will inevitably take the extreme route. Therefore, the increase in the number of employed people in the world at present is indeed a major reason for maintaining the status quo, that is, the United Kingdom increased from 9,681,000 people in 1933 to 10,961,000 people in August 1936, and the US employment index increased from 69.0 in 1933 to 88.7 in 1936 (with 1923-25 as 100), and Germany increased from 13 million people in 1933 to 17.8 million people in August 1936.

### Table of US, British, and Japanese Employment Indices

Finally, we cannot but earnestly advise humanity. At this present time, as the second World War is about to erupt, we are fully aware that the continuous expansion of the production of these massive military supplies must inevitably lead to global poverty. Ultimately, humanity will descend into a nihilistic madness born of destitution, embracing war as a joyous event, thereby leading to the maturation of a global war crisis. Therefore, our sincere advice may well be akin to the breath of a small fish in the vast ocean.

We cannot deny that Karl Marx believed the evolutionary history of mankind to be a history of struggle, requiring war to achieve peace. Nor can we deny T.R. Malthus's belief that the rate of population growth exceeds the rate of food production. However, we believe that human wisdom may yet overcome this cruel and tragic war. That is, if the whole world were to dismantle useless armaments and divert the productive forces now consumed by military construction to scientific projects aimed at overcoming natural disasters and conquering natural deficiencies, then the limited living resources of the world could be conserved, and the unlimited ones could be increased. The needless sacrifices from natural disasters could also be avoided. In the future, when the Earth's space can no longer accommodate humanity, we may not be able to transplant ourselves to the Moon as dreamed of by Wells and others. But at the very least, through the reclamation of barren lands, the improvement of deserts, and the construction of tall buildings, we may not necessarily face the dire predictions of Malthus. Otherwise, the more global armaments expand and the more frequent human wars become, the more the world economy will panic due to incessant warfare. If this cycle continues endlessly, the Earth's inherent limited resources, such as iron, coal, petroleum, aluminum, and nickel, will be completely exhausted, ultimately leading to the true end of the world! This is by no means an empty statement!

Even a tiny bamboo splinter pricking our hand causes us immense pain. How can we bear to see tens of millions of human beings with limbs crushed beneath the tracks of tanks, or fed en masse to artillery fire? Therefore, based on economic theory, we must oppose the expansion of global armaments. At the same time, based on humanitarian principles, we must also oppose the expansion of global armaments!

If we seek genuine global economic prosperity, if we seek an eternally peaceful and bright life for all of humanity, then we have no choice but to demand complete global disarmament!

### Raw Cotton

Overseas Cotton Market Fluctuations Uncertain

Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with poor Liverpool telegrams. Overnight, brokers and foreign long positions were closed out, and Bombay brokers sold off, causing declines of two to six points for each month. Afterward, fellow traders bought in, and ginning estimates were as expected. New outside traders were quiet. The situation regarding the Japanese political climate and cotton loans is difficult to predict. Traders hope that the issue of suspicious cotton loans can be announced by the end of next week, but it has not yet been officially discussed. The market closed firm, with spot prices unchanged and futures up two points to down three points. British spot cotton was unchanged, and futures were down one point. The amounts of long closures and short sales of Indian cotton were absorbed by fellow traders, and some bought Indian cotton to offset Liverpool sales. Pingor was down half a rupee, Oomra was down 0.15 to 1.5 rupees, and Broach was down 1.5 rupees. Original telegram recorded left (23rd telegram).

Also, according to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 24th was Broach at 224 rupees, Oomra at 204.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees, and Pingor at 178.75 rupees, up 1.25 rupees.

Large Quantities of Silver Shipped to India

Rumors of Increased Indian Silver Import Tax Gradually Disappear

Reuters, Bombay, 23rd: Mowinckel's weekly report states that the silver market lacked enthusiasm last week. It is uncertain whether the US silver purchase program will continue. Although domestic demand has been very active recently, it is feared that this is due to speculation. Rumors of an increase in the import tax are now disbelieved. The recovery of domestic sales is also due to rumors that the import tax will increase. The difference between near and far terms has narrowed by one anna. Domestic demand averaged approximately 165 bars per day during the week. Approximately 35,000 bars were rolled over after February delivery. Silver worth a total of £1,195,000 has been scheduled to arrive this week. A batch of silver worth £140,000 will be carried on the first mail ship to arrive.

### North-South Goods

Tremella Prices Rising Sharply

Tremella prices have been rising steadily for days, and the tight situation has not eased. Yesterday, Sichuan tremella saw new high prices again. The seller opened at five yuan, raised to 144 yuan, up six yuan from before. According to Hankou telegrams, the price of Xing'an goods from Hekou has also risen to 120 yuan, up three yuan from before. Therefore, market activity is increasing without end. Ding Sheng Aviation's small packages of tremella are quoted up ten yuan. Guang Bang's counter-offers are outrageous, and no deals have been made yet.

### Civil Defense Training Institute Practicing Gas Defense and Rescue Work

Central News Agency: The Shanghai Civil Defense Training Institute, after the completion of training for the first group of students, focused on practical gas defense and rescue work. Yesterday (24th), they performed a demonstration at the Shanghai-Tai Hospital on Hu Tai Road. About 30 students participated in the practical demonstration. At 9:00 AM, they gathered at the Shanghai-Tai Long-Distance Bus Station. At 10:00 AM, they took a bus to the site. After lunch, they prepared for the rescue work. At 2:00 PM, they practiced stretcher and bandage work. At 3:00 PM, they practiced gas protection. At 4:00 PM, they practiced burial. Although the weather was unfavorable, the students, under the guidance of teacher Wang Juying and others, braved the rain to perform, showing even greater enthusiasm. The situation during the gas defense performance was even more intense, as if they were on the battlefield. It is said that the gas masks were borrowed from the Shanghai Fuxing Craft Society. Mr. Zhao of the society sympathized with the national cause and readily agreed. The results of the performance were very good. Reporters took pictures in sequence. Guests who braved the rain to watch included Mr. Wen Shaozu, the Western president of the Christian Popular Benefit Society, and others, all of whom expressed their admiration. The demonstration ended at 5:00 PM, and they returned to Shanghai by the original bus. On the way, they sang heroic songs. By the time they arrived in Shanghai, the city was illuminated with countless lights.

### The Fourth Day of the Income Tax Research Conference

Discussing Accounting Issues. Closes This Afternoon

The Income Tax Research Conference, convened by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, continued to meet yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss accounting issues and conduct supplementary research on various cases in categories one, two, and three. Details are recorded below.

Chamber of Commerce Public Banquet: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a public banquet at the Bank Club yesterday at noon for representatives of chambers of commerce from various regions. More than 20 representatives from the chambers of commerce of Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Jiaxing, Changshu, Qingpu, Wujin, and Shaoxing, including Liu Zhanbai, Zhong Mingyu, Shen Shengwu, Song Zhongpeng, Zha Bingchu, Wu Weiping, and others, attended. Chairman Ke Ganqing reported on the reasons for holding this research conference and the necessity of continuing discussions in the future. Representatives Wang Jie'an and Gu Suming gave speeches and expressed their gratitude.

Subcommittee Meeting: The third subcommittee meeting was held at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Gu Suming, Wang Jie'an, Qian Shuchu, Chen Ziyi, Chen Weiwen, and Wang Yonghai attended. Gu Suming was elected chairman. The following was resolved: (1) The case that stores should still retain the cash-basis accounting system was resolved: This case is already clearly stipulated in Articles 90 of the Collection Guidelines for Category One. (2) The case that interest income on deposits is taxed at a uniform rate of 5%, which is unfair, and should be changed to a progressive system was resolved: Adopting a progressive system is a reasonable system, but it is easy to cause abuses before the household registration law is implemented. This case is tentatively reserved.

Research Conference: The fourth day of the research conference was held at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. 133 representatives attended. Chairman Gu Suming reported on the resolutions of the third subcommittee meeting, which were adopted by the general assembly. The discussion then turned to income tax and accounting issues. (1) The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce proposed that commercial books should be used according to their usual practices, only taking what is sufficient to prove the amount of income, and should not be forced to change. Resolved: This case is already stipulated in Article 24 of the Implementation Regulations. (2) The Silk and Hemp Industry Association proposed that the applicable books should be stipulated for each industry to achieve uniformity. Resolved: Passed. (3) The case that the valuation of inventory should be determined by the guild. Resolved: The valuation of inventory is stipulated in the valuation method. The so-called market price also includes the fair price stipulated by the same industry. (4) The Cotton Cloth Industry Association proposed how to handle the valuation of inventory and bad debt discounts. Resolved: The valuation of inventory has already been stipulated, and the bad debt discount has also been passed by the general assembly. Please add a line to the expenses section: "Reasonably predicted bad debt losses." (5) The Western Paint Industry proposed that representatives of the chamber of commerce and guilds should be invited by the authorities to participate in the selection of members of the review committee. Resolved: This case is already stipulated in Article 17 of the Provisional Regulations. (6) Each guild should assist the income tax office in collecting taxes to avoid harassment. Resolved: Income tax is directly woven into the central bank, but during the investigation, the income tax office should jointly handle the matter with the guilds of each industry at any time to avoid disputes. (7) The Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce proposed whether the IOUs issued by local governments and groups should be regarded as a type of bond issued by the local government, and whether income tax should be deducted when interest is paid. Resolved: Strictly interpreted according to the regulations, it should not be deducted. (8) The upper-level government sometimes uses government bonds to be borrowed from various banks by local governments for the needs of each place, and designates the winning lottery and interest of the government bonds for repaying the principal and interest of the loan. Can the local government be exempted from paying income tax when receiving the interest of this government bond? Resolved: This article is already clearly stipulated in Article 6 of the Collection Guidelines for Category Three. (9) The Timber Industry Association proposed that the interest on pension funds, retirement funds, and alimony should be exempted from income tax. Resolved: Passed, and submitted to the Ministry of Finance to add a paragraph in Article 2, Category Three of the Provisional Regulations. (10) The Hardware Industry Association proposed that the Chamber of Commerce organize a committee to design the accounting system for each industry. Resolved: Passed, and contributed to the high-level conferences in various places, the special committees of each group, to study and exchange opinions at any time.

Mr. Xu's Speech: Accountant Xu Yongzuo gave a speech at the general assembly yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on income tax and accounting issues. He said: "Today we are discussing income tax and accounting issues. The relationship between this issue and merchants is very close. I would like to raise two points to discuss: First, after the implementation of income tax, what merchants urgently need to prepare is the reorganization of capital and property. Second, the improvement of bookkeeping and accounting. The above two points are the most important and practical tasks. In our country's business community, the amount of capital is not paid much attention to. For example, if the capital owner has credit, the outside world does not care about the amount of his capital. The money shop will do business with him and absorb a large amount of deposits. However, the retained earnings over the years are recorded in the open aspects, such as gold accumulation books or public reserve books. In the hidden aspects, the property is valued very low. For example, a certain company's year-end inventory and machinery and other assets are valued at 100,000 yuan at market value, but the valuation is lowered to 50,000 yuan, and the remaining 50,000 yuan is retained earnings. This kind of hidden profit is called secret reserve in accounting. In addition, it is inevitable that there will be bad debts and defaults in the accounts released by the business. Ordinary and prudent managers often do not pay attention to and study them. Under this circumstance, the amount of capital of the business is not accurate. Even if the capital is only a few thousand yuan, the profit is tens of thousands of yuan, which is not simply the result of using a few thousand yuan of capital. Now that income tax is implemented, merchants should first pay attention to determining the amount of capital, so as to avoid being unfairly taxed in the future. How should the amount of capital be determined? Regarding the public reserve part, before the regulations are revised, only one-third can be used as capital. However, in general observation, it is believed that the larger the capital, the less tax is paid. Then we can apply for more capital. This is certainly very beneficial in terms of paying taxes, but there are also many inconveniences. This does not need to be stated clearly, especially in the mainland, where there is business tax, which is even more unfavorable. In the United States, profit-making enterprises pay two types of taxes: one is ordinary tax, and the other is excess tax. Ordinary tax must be levied if the profit exceeds a certain amount and does not involve the amount of capital. Excess tax is divided into two types: one is capital tax, and the other is profit tax. Assuming that the profit exceeds 20%, excess tax must be levied (excess tax also takes a progressive system) and there is a conflict between each other, which is similar to the situation of our country's business tax and income tax. Therefore, property valuation must be accurate. In the future, the settlement of profit and loss and the closing method must be based on the collection guidelines and asset valuation methods. In the past, the regulations on depreciation methods for businesses stipulated that the original price is lower than the market price, the original price is used; the original price is higher than the market price, the market price is used. Cement houses are stipulated for 60 years, and wooden frame brick and stone houses are stipulated for 30 years, with a maximum depreciation of one-sixtieth. If depreciation has been over-appropriated in the past, then the previous tax will be levied. This point should also be noted. Now, on the one hand, we are requesting that the declaration deadline be extended. After we have finished our general summary, we must conduct a thorough inventory of assets and prepare a balance sheet. Second, regarding the improvement of accounting and bookkeeping, it is necessary to improve and complete them after the income tax is levied. Otherwise, it will be impossible to prepare the property catalog, balance sheet, and profit and loss statement. The old-fashioned bookkeeping methods in our country really need to be improved. For example, the rolling account book or the cash book, how much is received, how much is paid, the so-called "Helongmen" (balancing the books), there is no problem. However, in reality, even if the "Helongmen" is balanced, the accounts are still not balanced. This is the same as the foreign bookkeeping, which only seeks the balance of the debit and credit sides. Generally speaking, if all businesses in our country use Western-style bookkeeping, there is a common difficulty: the bookkeeper must have Western-style bookkeeping knowledge, but in fact, it is not easy for the bookkeeper to understand the account book at a glance. Western-style bookkeeping has different receipt and payment habits, is not easy to understand, and requires the bookkeeper to have bookkeeping knowledge, which is actually difficult to achieve universally. I think that if the old bookkeeping methods in our country are improved, the first advantage is that everyone can understand them without having specialized bookkeeping knowledge, and there is no need for major changes. The improved Chinese bookkeeping that I created has several advantages: First, it does not break the rice bowls of old-fashioned bookkeepers. Second, it maintains the original Chinese habits. Third, it takes into account the general economic situation and still applies Chinese paper and ink. This kind of improved Chinese bookkeeping that maintains the traditional Chinese bookkeeping system is both reasonable in theory and practice. It can be said that it is the only shortcut for merchants to put accounting on the right track and complete bookkeeping with half the effort."

Today's Agenda: Today at 12:00 noon, more than 190 representatives from chambers of commerce in various regions and guilds in this city will hold a public banquet at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road on the seventh floor to thank accountant Xu Yongzuo. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the meeting will continue, and accountants Pan Xulun, Xi Yushu, and Li Wenjie will be invited to give speeches. The meeting will close at 5:00 PM.

### Accountants Association Submits Document to Ministry of Finance

Regarding Category One of Income Tax: Contributing Opinions on Collection Guidelines

The Accountants Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, stating: We respectfully submit this document to report that the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules have been fully implemented since January 1st of this year, as ordered. In addition to the Regulations and Implementation Rules, your Ministry has also established collection guidelines for each category, with the intention of enabling taxpayers to understand the tax payment procedures, which is extremely virtuous and admirable. We hold the Category Three collection guidelines in high regard, as the banking industry had previously provided input, and therefore the guidelines accommodate much and do not require further elaboration. Furthermore, regarding Category Two concerning independent professions, associations such as lawyers, accountants, doctors, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and engineers have submitted separate joint petitions. As for the Category One collection guidelines, our association has studied them and feels that there are aspects that do not align with the established laws protecting tax sources and the realities of society. We are now presenting these to your Ministry separately. From a legal perspective, we believe one point is inapplicable: We have examined the Income Tax Provisional Regulations, the Implementation Rules, and the Collection Guidelines, which are intended to supplement any deficiencies in the Regulations or Rules. Collection Guidelines, however, have not gone through the legislative process and are a type of administrative order, and therefore cannot change or conflict with laws. This is a fundamental principle. However, item 15 of the draft states, "Losses from the previous year's business operations cannot be included in this year's calculations." The current Company Law adopts the principle that losses must be covered before profits can be distributed, to ensure that companies remain in a solid and secure position, which is extremely virtuous and admirable. Therefore, Article 38 of the Company Law states, "A company may not distribute profits until losses have been covered," and Article 171 states, "A company may not distribute dividends or bonuses until losses have been covered and reserve funds have been allocated." In addition, the Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Affairs Office published a document titled "Income Tax Currently in Effect," which stated that the fundamental principle of income tax is to collect taxes based on the taxpayer's ability to pay. The obligation to pay taxes arises only if there is income. Those with no income or income below the taxable threshold are not obligated to pay taxes. Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations also stipulates, "The income of Category One shall be taxed based on the net profit." Furthermore, Article 15 of the Implementation Rules stipulates, "When calculating Category One income tax, actual operating expenses, bad debts, depreciation, inventory, consumption, public levies, and legally mandated reserve funds shall be deducted from the total revenue, and the remaining amount shall be considered the net profit." This clearly indicates that the so-called net profit should be based on the figure calculated for the year in years without prior losses. In years with accumulated losses, it should be in accordance with Article 171 of the Company Law, where the profits should first be used to offset the prior losses. Only if there is still a surplus can it be considered net profit. This is because, according to legal regulations, only at this point, after allocating reserve funds, can distributions be made. Otherwise, Article 232 of the Company Law stipulates penalties of imprisonment for up to one year or fines of up to 2,000 yuan. If investors cannot receive distributions, they naturally do not need to pay taxes. This is the meaning of "no income, no tax obligation." If the distribution amount is less than the profit calculated for the year due to offsetting losses, taxes should only be paid on the actual amount received. This is the meaning of "income matches capital" in Article 3 of the Regulations. The principle is extremely clear. Now, the Category One collection guidelines state that the previous year's business losses cannot be offset against this year's profits, which essentially severs the relationship between tax and income. This seems to conflict with the Provisional Regulations and Implementation Rules. It is unacceptable to change a law with an order. Now, changing the essence and spirit of the Income Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules with collection guidelines seems even more inappropriate. There is another matter that we would like clarified in the guidelines, which is the calculation method for Category One A and B taxpayers. For example, consider a limited liability company with a capital of 100,000 yuan and reserve funds of 30,000 yuan. This year, it has a profit of 16,000 yuan, with no prior losses. In our association's opinion, the distribution and tax payment should be calculated as follows: ㊀ First, allocate 1/10 to the statutory reserve fund, totaling 1,600 yuan. ㊁ Distribute the remaining 14,400 yuan according to the articles of association originally registered with the Ministry of Industry. A. Shareholders receive 70%, or 10,080 yuan, distributed among shareholders with 100,000 yuan of capital. This means that the income matches the actual capital amount, between 10% and 15%, and should be taxed at a rate of 40 per mille. However, because there are 30,000 yuan in reserve funds, according to Article 7 of the Implementation Rules, 1/3 of the reserve funds can be included in the capital calculation, bringing the total to 110,000 yuan. Dividing 10,080 yuan by 110,000 yuan results in less than 10%, so it can be taxed at only 30 per mille. B. Remuneration for directors and supervisors, 10%, should be taxed according to the tax rate for Category Two professionals. C. Remuneration for managers and deputy managers, 5%, should be taxed according to the tax rate for Category Two professionals. D. Remuneration for all employees, 15%, should be taxed according to the tax rate for Category Two professionals. Currently, some mistakenly believe that taxes should be calculated based on the 16,000 yuan figure, while others mistakenly believe it should be based on the 14,400 yuan figure, with directors and others paying taxes separately under Category Two. This seems contrary to the legislative intent, where shareholders receive less income but pay more taxes. We propose that this be clarified in the Category One collection guidelines to ensure clarity. From the perspective of protecting tax sources, we believe three points are inapplicable: During this time of national crisis, the government has introduced income tax. All citizens should actively contribute. However, the greatest principle of taxation is to nurture tax sources and leave taxpayers with sufficient resources. The draft focuses on increasing tax revenue without focusing on protecting tax sources. To illustrate, 1. Item 11 of the draft states, "If the reserve fund has reached 1/2 of the total capital, (1) the reserve fund allocated shall not be considered a statutory reserve fund." While this does not conflict with the Company Law, the intent is clearly different. Article 170 of the Company Law states that reserve funds must be allocated until they reach 1/2 of the total capital, and may not be allocated once they have reached 1/2 of the total capital. The draft stipulates that if the statutory reserve fund has reached 1/2 of the total capital, it may no longer be allocated. The spirit between "may" and "may not" is vastly different. The draft does not want the "statutory reserve fund" to reduce net profit, so it does not allow further allocation of the statutory reserve fund once the limit of Article 170 of the Company Law has been reached. (Other types of reserve funds are not prohibited, but they cannot enjoy the treatment of Article 15 of the Implementation Rules.) This is intended to increase net profit and thicken tax revenue. (2) Item 12, Clause 4 (Clause 5 states, "Expenses for business expansion or equipment renovation, as well as repair expenses for buildings, factories, warehouses, machinery, tools, equipment, and ships, which are sufficient to increase value or effectiveness, shall not be considered necessary and reasonable business expenses and shall be deducted when calculating net profit." The intent is to treat these expenses entirely as capital expenditures to increase net profit and thicken tax revenue. Clause 5 is limited to those that can increase value or effectiveness, while Clause 4 stipulates no limit, and all expenses for business expansion or equipment renovation must be included in capital expenditures, which seems overly broad. (3) The depreciation calculation table stipulates minimum useful life: wooden buildings 20 years, brick and stone buildings 30 years, reinforced concrete or brick-clad stone buildings 60 years. The lifespan stipulations for other items such as machinery, tools, and equipment are also too long. Extending the depreciation period reduces depreciation expenses, which directly increases net profit and indirectly thickens tax revenue. Our country's industrial and commercial enterprises are just beginning to sprout, unlike advanced countries that have entered a regular orbit. Actions that can solidify the foundation and increase strength, such as retaining more reserve funds and broadly increasing depreciation, should be encouraged and rewarded, not restricted. For the sake of permanent tax revenue, the government should also nurture tax sources and leave taxpayers with sufficient resources, and should not be overly harsh or detailed, which could reduce their strength. ㊂ From the perspective of observing the facts, we believe three points are inapplicable: Income tax is newly established in our country, and the people are not yet accustomed to it. In the initial implementation, we should not seek excessive depth. For example, 1. Item 12, Clause 3 of the draft states, "Voluntary donations shall not be considered necessary and reasonable business expenses and shall be deducted when calculating net profit." Following this, all expenses other than government-mandated taxes and levies are considered "voluntary donations" and cannot be listed as "necessary and reasonable expenses." For example, the fire-fighting donation in Shanghai's Nanshi district is voluntarily contributed by businesses to support the fire department's operations. If this clause is followed, the Nanshi Fire Department may have to close. Other public welfare, charitable, and educational activities rely heavily on donations. If this clause is followed, these activities will be greatly affected. To prevent tax evasion, regulations and restrictions can be stipulated (such as limiting the amount or restricting the target). There is no need to abandon food because of choking and completely eliminate donations. 2. Item 18 of the asset valuation method states, "The consumption caused by physical inventory shall not exceed 5% of the book inventory amount." The degree of consumption varies depending on the type and nature of the goods. Easily dispersed items such as grease, easily broken items such as light bulbs, and easily spoiled items such as fruits and seafood cannot all be limited to 5%. 3. The draft stipulates a depreciation rate calculation table listing seven categories: buildings, chimneys, decorations, ships, machinery, tools, and equipment. There are tens of thousands of industrial and commercial enterprises across the country, with a wide variety of assets. How can these seven categories encompass them all? Even within the same category, the materials are different. For example, machinery is not all made of iron or wood. Even among the same iron machinery, the nature and quality are different. It is absolutely impossible to uniformly set the minimum useful life at 16 years. In the initial implementation of income tax, it is not necessary to pursue excessive complexity. Fixed assets do not need to be classified. If classification is necessary, then each industry has its unique assets that must be listed separately, such as the poles and wires of the electrical industry, the water pipes of the water supply industry, the mining of mines, and the paper plates of the paper industry. It may be difficult to list all other types in detail. Moreover, the electrical industry has accounting subjects stipulated by the Construction Committee, and the railway industry has railway accounting subjects stipulated by the Ministry of Railways, which are not applicable to ordinary subjects. Therefore, it is better to express them in general terms. As for the depreciation period, it is also appropriate to include flexibility, ranging from several years to several years, leaving room for adjustment. The above is all that our association has considered. Because the income of Category One is related to social industrial and commercial enterprises, accountants serve a large portion of the industrial and commercial sector. In addition, your Ministry has requested opinions from all sectors on the Regulations and Implementation Rules regarding the implementation of income tax, referring to our country's economic organization, social environment, and the state of industry and commerce. We admire your Ministry's openness and careful consideration. Therefore, we dare to contribute our humble opinion, hoping that it will be reviewed and adopted for improvement and smooth implementation. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance, China Certified Public Accountants Association, January 22, 1937.

### Independent Professional Groups File Regular Petition

Petition to Reduce Income Tax Rates

The China Certified Public Accountants Association, Shanghai Bar Association, Chinese Institute of Engineers, Architectural Society of China, Shanghai Medical Association, Chinese Medical Association, Shenzhou Chinese Medical Association, being organizations of independent professions with the heaviest income tax rates, are jointly petitioning the Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry, earnestly requesting a reduction in rates, approval to calculate and pay taxes according to the average of twelve months per year as per regulations, and contributing opinions on the collection guidelines. Representatives will be dispatched on the 27th to jointly go to the capital to petition. The details are recorded as follows:

Reduce Tax Rates and Pay Annually: The China Certified Public Accountants Association and other groups have submitted documents to the Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry, stating: We respectfully submit this document to report that the Ministry of Finance (Your Ministry) has announced that the independent professions income tax will be implemented and collected from January 1st of this year. The associations should comply. However, in the Provisional Regulations, the associations generally believe that the highest tax rate stipulated for independent professions and the point of paying monthly are lacking the principle of fairness in taxation. We are respectfully presenting these separately to Your Yuan (Ministry). 1. The regulations stipulate that the income of independent professions is taxed monthly. However, the income of independent professions must deduct various expenses, and its nature is actually similar to the income of Category One A profit-seeking enterprises. There are busy and slow months in a year, and the monthly average is not easy to obtain until the end of the year. Sometimes, the busy and slow months in a year offset each other, resulting in no income at all. This happens frequently. If taxes are paid daily, the slow months with losses and no profits can be exempted from paying taxes. However, the taxes paid in the busy months do not comply with the regulations for tax refunds. This is clearly unfair. We have heard that the Ministry of Finance (Your Ministry) plans to stipulate in the "Draft Collection Guidelines for Category Two Salary and Remuneration Income Tax" that the income of independent professions will be settled every six months. This shows that the Ministry of Finance (Your Ministry) is already aware of the difficulties reported by the associations. We are grateful and dare not make further requests. However, independent professions are indeed no different from Category One A profit-seeking enterprises, and both use the end of the year as the settlement period. Moreover, the complexity of business operations varies from year to year. If settlements are made every six months, it will still be difficult to comply with the principle of paying taxes on a monthly average. We earnestly request that you consider the situation and allow the income tax of independent professions to be calculated and paid according to the average of twelve months based on the net income calculated at the end of the year, as per the regulations, to show leniency. 2. The regulations stipulate that the tax rate for Category One A and B income should be 100 per mille for income exceeding 25% of the actual capital. According to this calculation, a profit-seeking enterprise with a paid-in capital of 10,000 yuan must make a profit of more than 2,500 yuan to pay 250 yuan in taxes. Furthermore, the tax rate for Category One C income is set at 2 per mille only when the income reaches 19,000 yuan. The tax rate for Category Three is set at 50 per mille regardless of the amount of income. However, the tax rate for Category Two independent professions requires only an income of 1,100 yuan to be taxed at 2 per mille. Now, we will take a net income of 2,000 yuan as a standard for comparison in the table below:

As mentioned above, the tax rate for independent professions is much higher than other categories, which is already obvious. In the old regulations, the classification of income stipulated that Category One profit-seeking enterprises must have both capital and labor. Category Three income from securities and deposits requires only capital and can be said to be unearned income. Category Two income from salaries and remuneration is purely obtained through labor. The difficulty of obtaining income for the three is vastly different, but the standards of taxation seem to be unfair in the way they reverse the weight of the tax burden. The independent professions feel that the burden is too heavy. We earnestly request that you consider the difficulty of earning income through labor and revise the tax rate for independent professions. The above two points are deeply felt by the members and have been requested to be forwarded. The Ministry of Finance (Your Ministry) has requested opinions from all sectors through the Income Tax Affairs Office regarding the implementation of income tax. We admire the careful consideration. Therefore, we are earnestly presenting this and respectfully request that Your Yuan (Ministry) adopt and implement it for the convenience of the public. Respectfully submitted, in addition to separate submissions.

Banquet for Liang Hejun to Go to the Capital to Petition: A Xin Xin She reporter learned that the China Certified Public Accountants Association, Shanghai Bar Association, Chinese Institute of Engineers, Architectural Society of China, Shanghai Medical Association, Shanghai Chinese Medical Association, Chinese Medical Association, and Shenzhou Chinese Medical Association, in addition to petitioning for the reduction of income tax for independent professional groups and contributing opinions, have specifically scheduled a banquet for Liang Hejun, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 8:00 PM on the 27th of this month (Wednesday) to exchange opinions on income tax for independent professions. It is also decided that representatives will be selected that evening to jointly take the overnight express train to the capital to petition the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, and other departments, requesting a reduction in tax rates.

### Request for Extension of Industrial and Commercial Loans: Ministry of Finance Approves Accommodation Measures

The First Special District Citizens' Federation, based on the request of industrial and commercial firms in various districts for a one-year extension of the repayment of overdue industrial and commercial loans, immediately forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The association has now received the Ministry of Finance's Qian Zi No. "1982" reply, stating: A document submitted on January 5, 1937, requesting consideration of the difficult times and approval for a one-year extension of the repayment of overdue industrial and commercial loans has been received. The Ministry has previously received a submission from the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee, proposing to formulate collection and loan disbursement measures for the loans issued. Article 2, Item A of the measures stipulates that if the borrower requests to repay a portion of the loan before the loan term expires, and the remaining outstanding principal and interest can be repaid in one lump sum within one month after the loan expires or in installments, accommodation may be granted. However, the minimum amount to be repaid each time must reach one-quarter of the total loan amount, and all overdue interest must be paid in full at the time of the last repayment. The Ministry has approved this and ordered it to be implemented. This reply is to be forwarded for compliance.

### Security Team Party Guidance Committee Requests Chiang to Return to the Capital

To Preside Over Party and National Affairs

The Municipal Security Team Party Affairs Guidance Committee, believing that the current situation is becoming increasingly serious, telegraphed Vice Chairman Chiang yesterday, requesting him to return to the capital ahead of schedule to make decisions on the major plans of the party and the nation. The original telegram is as follows: FengHua, Vice Chairman Chiang, Your Esteemed Presence: Your rest and recuperation in your hometown has been fleeting. At this time when the border is in a serious situation and the flames of rebellion are intensifying, we respectfully request that you return to the capital ahead of schedule to preside over important political affairs and make decisions on the major plans of the party and the nation, to comfort the people's expectations and relieve the national crisis. We earnestly pray. Shanghai Municipal Security Team Party Affairs Guidance Committee salutes.

### Qian Dajun Has Returned to His Hometown for Recuperation

Qian Dajun, Director of the Chairman's Adjutant Office of the Military Affairs Commission, who was injured in the Xi'an Incident and came to Shanghai for treatment, according to news from the Qian residence yesterday, has recovered from his injuries and has left Shanghai to return to his hometown of Zhengyi for a brief period of recuperation. He will then proceed directly to the capital to attend the Third Plenary Session.

### Yan Huiqing Will Go to Hangzhou Tomorrow Morning

Dr. Yan Huiqing, the former Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, after arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin a few days ago, has been busy visiting friends. It is learned that Yan will take the early express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou on business tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. It is expected that he will stay in Hangzhou for several days before returning to Shanghai.

### Automobile Drivers' Union Changes to Twelve-Hour Work System

Yesterday's Notice to All Members

Dagon She reports that the Automobile Drivers' Union, in order to improve the twelve-hour work system, yesterday issued a notice to all members stating that, for the sake of reducing the deep suffering of all workers, it has specially adopted a scientific statistical method to change the working hours to a twelve-hour system. The main points are as follows: ㊀ From Monday to Friday, an average of 15 trips per day, each trip lasting about 40 minutes, plus 5 car releases, each lasting about 15 minutes, totaling 675 minutes of work per day (equivalent to 11 hours and 15 minutes). This type of trip work is not continuous, but fragmented, usually separated by about an hour. Day and night, one cannot eat a comfortable meal, and at night, one cannot get a full night's sleep. When one has energy, there is no business, but when one is tired, trips come one after another. In the middle of the night, when one is tired and half-asleep, a customer comes to call a car, and one has to go out. One's eyes are glued shut, and the customer keeps urging one to hurry. This kind of suffering is truly difficult to describe in words. There is a feeling of preferring to go to hell than to do this work. From Monday to Friday, on days such as celebratory festivals and school opening and closing days, there are more than 20 trips. ㊁ On Saturdays and Sundays, there are about 30 trips per day, each averaging 40 minutes, totaling 1200 minutes (equivalent to 20 hours). There are only 4 hours left in the whole day and night. After deducting the time for eating and cleaning the car, how much time is left for sleep? ㊂ During festivals, birthdays, New Year's Day, and the Lunar New Year, one has to work for several days and nights in a row without rest (more than 40 trips each night). Because the company stipulates shifts, each shift lasts at least three or four days and nights, and sometimes six or seven days and nights, with no certainty. The root of the disaster lies in this. ㊃ The current situation of trips is roughly the same day and night. During the day, there are businesses such as going up and down writing rooms, offices, and shopping. At night, there are trips to and from theaters, Jai Alai fields, dog racing fields, and after midnight, there are dances and other businesses. Therefore, trips are endless day and night, with almost no stop. Workers are extremely tired and often fall asleep holding paper cards, or fall asleep on the road, or cause accidents. The various situations mentioned above are generally speaking. Therefore, we request immediate liberation and a change to a twelve-hour workday. The benefits of improving the work after the improvement are: (1) Car workers can maintain their health and increase their lifespan, and can reduce mental suffering after accidents. (2) It can reduce the number of unemployed drivers in the city. (3) It can eliminate the accidental danger to pedestrians. (4) It can ensure the safety of passengers. (5) It can reduce the number of illegal accident cases in the police station. (6) The company can reduce the losses from automobile accidents.

### The Tobacco Exchange Industry Reports to the Social Affairs Bureau That Exchange Rate Depression is Involuntary

Presenting the Actual Situation

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in response to the depression of exchange rates in the market, instructed the Tobacco Exchange Trade Association to investigate, clarify, and report on measures to prevent it. The association yesterday prepared a formal report stating that the low exchange rate was due to their industry being at the mercy of others, with no suspicion of manipulation. They implored the Bureau to devise relief measures to maintain their operations and comply with orders. The report cited the Bureau's instruction No. 7802 Hai, which stated that according to citizen reports, the Ministry of Finance's currency reform and fixed silver dollar price were intended to benefit the people and prevent manipulation by unscrupulous merchants, and had been clearly promulgated. However, recently, exchange shops in the city disregarded public orders, implementing old methods of lowering the silver dollar price, even by 20 to 30 copper coins, especially during the year-end period when people face financial difficulties. Such behavior by unscrupulous merchants was considered unrighteous and a violation of promulgated orders. Without strict prevention, there would be no restraint in the future. Therefore, considering the recent sudden drop in the exchange rate of national currency, and the fact that exchange rates for copper coins, subsidiary currency, and small silver dollars did not comply with regulations, exchange shops were suspected of manipulation. In addition to separate orders, the association was ordered to investigate and prevent this, reporting back for review. It was also noted that before the year-end accounting period in the city, the silver dollar price inevitably fell, affecting the market significantly. Since the currency reform, exchange rates had been stable, and such occurrences should not happen again. As the year-end approached, it was necessary to devise preventative measures in advance. The association was instructed to comply, report back, and so on.

Upon receiving these instructions, the executive and supervisory committee members were immediately convened to discuss preventative measures. It was unanimously believed that the tobacco exchange industry had practically disappeared since the currency reform in November of the previous year. The reason for this was that the purchase of copper coins, subsidiary currency, and small silver dollars had always been done by sending apprentices to small vegetable markets or other shops. Vegetable market vendors and other shops sold small amounts of money and needed to purchase goods with silver dollars. At that time, the silver dollar price varied, and they were willing to pay our colleagues a commission of one or two cents to exchange for silver dollars for business operations. Our colleagues earned a small profit from buying and selling. However, since the reform, exchange rates were regulated by order, and vegetable market vendors no longer paid extra for exchanging small amounts. Moreover, other shops could exchange currency, and electric and steam-powered buses allowed passengers to buy seven-cent tickets and receive subsidiary currency worth ninety cents or twenty-three copper coins in exchange for a silver dollar. This situation led to no one patronizing our industry. Since our industry was engaged in currency exchange, we had to find ways to purchase various small amounts of money to meet market demand. We exchanged with money exchange shops, and their market prices were clearly marked with hidden trading terms. Our colleagues had to accept them painfully to meet their needs. However, the goal of our colleagues was to seek small profits to feed themselves. For example, if 3,000 copper coins were purchased, after adding transportation and handling fees, only 2,970 coins could be exchanged, otherwise, there would be losses. If less than 3,000 coins were purchased, the exchange rate would also decrease accordingly. The same applied to small silver dollars. This was the actual situation of our industry being at the mercy of others. There was no manipulation or suspicion. However, outsiders did not understand the underlying reasons and blamed us, even viewing us as unscrupulous merchants. Our colleagues felt wronged and could not voice their grievances. Now, it was fortunate that the authorities recognized the situation and ordered preventative measures. For the sake of the citizens' interests and their own reputation, our colleagues should present the actual situation to the authorities for review and seek relief measures to comply with orders and maintain their operations. It was hoped that the authorities would promptly provide instructions for compliance.

### During the General Re-Investigation Period for Opium and Drug Offenders, Methods for Reporting Bandits May Be Used

Instructions Followed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to Shanghai County and Others

The Ta Kung Pao reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Government, to eliminate opium and drug offenders, had issued orders to all counties and cities to conduct a general re-investigation starting on January 1st of this year and had also stipulated methods for reporting opium and drug offenders. Yesterday, it also issued an order to the county governments of Shanghai, Binshan, and other counties stating that, during the general reporting period for opium and drug offenders in the province last year, reports by township and village chiefs and heads of households often led to lawsuits and losses. Without adequate protection, they would inevitably view assisting in the enforcement of prohibition as a dangerous task. The Provincial Government Committee, at its 800th meeting, resolved that township and village chiefs and heads of households reporting opium and drug offenders could apply Articles 6 and 7 of the Provisional Measures for Handling Reports of Bandits by Heads of Households and Chiefs of Households in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province.

### All Tooth and Bone Ware Workers in This City Went on Strike Yesterday

Today, they will go to Party and Government Agencies to Petition and Present Six Demands

The Rural Society reported that there are over 970 tooth and bone ware factory owners and bosses in this city, employing over 3,000 workers. Factory owners set the wages per item, ranging from 20 cents to $1.23 in national currency. Last year, factory owners cited poor business conditions and frequently reduced wages. However, the workers in this industry, due to the soaring prices of goods, found it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. As a last resort, in December of last year, all workers demanded a 60% wage increase based on their original salaries. The Shanghai Tooth and Bone Ware Workers' Union, together with the Tooth and Bone Ware Trade Association, repeatedly consulted and agreed to unify wages. The Trade Association notified all factory owners to implement the 60% wage increase based on the original salaries starting on January 1st, 26th year of the Republic. However, up to now, over 100 factory owners have refused to implement the unified wage, leading to dissatisfaction among over 400 workers who have not received the wage increase. These workers recently sent representatives to request assistance from the Union. Yang Guoliang, the executive director of the Union, and Jin Dongting, a staff member, negotiated with the factory owners. Only over 100 factory owners refused to implement the unified wage. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, over 400 workers who had not received the wage increase gathered at the Jishan Temple in Xinbeimen, Nanshi, to convene a temporary meeting of tooth and bone ware workers. 400 people attended, and Yang Jinsheng was elected as chairman. After the formalities, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting and the significance of a few factory owners refusing to implement the unified wage. Then, discussions began on the following cases: (1) Regarding how to deal with the few factory owners who refuse to implement the unified wage and oppress workers, it was resolved: (a) to go on strike together immediately; (b) to request assistance from the industry's union; (2) The following demands were made: (a) to improve treatment; (b) to demand that factory owners implement the unified wage; (c) not to arbitrarily reduce wages; (d) not to dismiss workers without cause; (e) to pay wages as usual during the strike period, and all losses of workers to be compensated by the factory owners; (f) to guarantee that similar actions of abuse against workers will not occur again in the future; (3) to organize a picket team to maintain order and persuade workers to take unified action; (4) to elect 50 representatives to petition the Party and government agencies and the Municipal General Labor Union today (the 25th). The Shanghai Tooth and Bone Ware Workers' Union, upon hearing the news, immediately sent executive director Yang Guoliang and others to vigorously persuade the workers to wait patiently for a resolution. However, the persuasion was ineffective. At around 2:00 PM, workers Yang Jinsheng, Wang Rongsheng, Dai Desheng, and seven others were walking on Fuyou Road, persuading workers to go on strike together, when they were spotted by police officers from the Shanghai Yimiao Police Station and arrested. The Union was notified and sent personnel with letters to the police station, and they were immediately released on bail.

### The Real Estate Association Opposes Water Rate Increases

Requesting the Chinese Ratepayers Association to Negotiate for a Stop, Continuing to Charge at 75% to Lighten the Burden

The New News Agency reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council Waterworks Company is changing the calculation of water rates from 75% to 80% per month, effectively raising prices, which users are opposing. The Real Estate Trade Association of this city has repeatedly received requests from its members, stating that in this time of economic downturn, real estate prices have plummeted, commerce has declined, and the market is bleak. Although there were good harvests in various regions last year, many are still unable to cope after years of losses. Vacant houses are numerous, and if the burden is suddenly increased at this time, it would be tantamount to bankrupting the industry. Tenants are unwilling to bear the burden, so they are all expressing opposition. The association is requested to send a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council to forward a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council to stop the company from increasing water rates and continue to charge at the original rate of 75%. It is also planned to submit a petition to the municipal government to negotiate to avoid the increase, thereby reducing the burden, maintaining people's livelihoods, and benefiting commerce.

### Rice Sales in This City are Declining

The End of the Year Closing is Approaching, and Rice Merchants are Complaining

The Ta Kung Pao reported that the largest transit sales routes for Shanghai rice are Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Xi'an, and other places. Daily transactions and shipments amount to over 20,000 to 30,000 bags. The Xi'an route has been suspended due to the unstable situation, and transactions on other routes are gradually becoming scarce due to the approaching end of the year and the imminent major closing. Merchants are preparing to complete closing procedures by the end of the month.

Sales Stagnation After transactions on various routes gradually decreased, river rice from Chang, Xi, Wu, Cheng, Kun, He, Hu, and other places in the interior continued to arrive, leading to an oversupply of rice. Stockpilers are also reducing stockpiles as the end of the year approaches and credit tightens. Rice shops in this city are preparing rice stocks, reducing them by 30% to 40% compared to normal times. This has led to stagnation in rice sales.

Continuing Decline in Rice Prices As a result, rice prices in Shanghai have continued to decline in recent days. Nine out of ten rice shipping merchants are reporting losses. According to rice industry leader Zhu Zixiang, speaking to a Ta Kung Pao reporter, rice prices usually rise at the end of the lunar year, but this year's situation is abnormal. Rice prices rose sharply during the autumn harvest, leading to the current decline. As for the Social Affairs Bureau's ban on rice price increases, in fact, rice prices are declining severely and cannot be prevented. Moreover, the association has not received this order, so the actual situation is unknown.

### United States Modifies Epidemic Inspection Methods

To Avoid Interfering with Ship Schedules

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported, according to a Reuters dispatch from New York, that starting February 1st, all incoming mail ships with qualified ship doctors need only report the health status of passengers to the port authorities via wireless radio, without having to stop for epidemic inspection, unless passengers are found to have infectious diseases. This applies to large ships like the Queen Mary, which can only enter the port at high tide. If they miss this time due to delays, they will have to stop for another day. Shanghai has already implemented this method for five or six years. All ships entering the Wusong Port are inspected by doctors from the Quarantine Bureau in Wusong without having to stop, in order to avoid delays. However, ships arriving from epidemic ports are subject to stricter inspections. The Quarantine Bureau is managed by Dr. Wu Liande and has many small ships, making its services very efficient.

### The French Municipal Council Responds to the Issue of Lowering House Tax

Claiming Discounts Were Already Applied

The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession has received repeated requests from citizens and members to request the French Municipal Council to reduce the 1936 house tax by implementing deductions. The association has sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, and the exchange of letters is excerpted below: The outgoing letter stated that when rent is used as the basis for the rental value, the total rent should be reduced proportionally to the benefits enjoyed by the landlord and tenant for the purpose of calculating the house tax: (1) Rent including water supply should be reduced by 5%; (2) Rent including electricity supply should be reduced by 5%; (3) Rent including a garbage incinerator should be reduced by 50%; (4) Rent including elevator equipment should be reduced by 10%. The total reduction for the above benefits cannot exceed 30% of the total rent. The reduction method for equipment-equipped houses should be determined by the director of the Bureau's Finance Office or his representative based on the scale of the tenant's enjoyment, but the net value of the rent after this reduction should not exceed 15%. The association requested the French Municipal Council to comply with the above methods to reduce the deductions. (Omitted below) The Council's reply stated that it had received the letter regarding all houses with water and electricity included in the rent, and that they should be handled in accordance with the 1936 tax settlement form.

The Chinese Jisheng Society, formerly a combination of various charity groups, went to Suiyuan to handle urgent disaster relief, with the guidance of Mr. Feng Yangshan, a member of the society. It has allocated 5,000 yuan for disaster relief to temporarily relieve the urgent needs of war survivors. In this freezing weather, the suffering and starvation are unbearable to describe. The thread of life hangs by a thread, and rescue is awaited in the midst of chaos. Those who hear of it are heartbroken, and those who speak of it shed tears. Now, the society has received letters and telegrams from the Henan Disaster Relief Association, stating that more than 30 counties are suffering from drought, snow, and severe cold, with people freezing and starving, and diseases are rampant, begging for relief to save lives. It is reported that the society has sent 2,000 bottles of Jisheng Dan and 600 bottles of Baoan Dan to treat the sick and suffering. However, there is a lack of funds to provide disaster relief. Kind-hearted people at home and abroad should have compassion for this natural disaster. If the society can raise funds, it plans to lend a helping hand. The parched crucian carp awaits to be revived, and we look forward to it.

### Fire at a Lithographic Printing Shop Due to Motor Explosion

The Yongchunxiang Lithographic Printing Shop, established by Gu Yongchun at No. 281 Shengyi Wharf Street, Wangjia Corner, South Shanghai, has been in business for several years and is very prosperous. At 10:40 AM yesterday, a fire broke out due to a motor explosion. The flames suddenly soared, becoming uncontrollable and breaking through the roof. Neighbors immediately notified the police and the fire brigades from various districts of South Shanghai were called to the scene to put out the fire. It was extinguished at around 11:00 AM. As a result, two stone-gate buildings, No. 281 and No. 275, were burned down. Shop owner Gu Yongchun and his brother Yongxiang jumped out of the window because the stairs were already on fire when they discovered the fire, resulting in serious head and foot injuries. The injured were taken to the Quzhifu Hospital for treatment by ambulance. The Dongjiadu Police Station interrogated the person responsible for the fire. It is reported that the shop had a fire insurance policy for 16,000 yuan with Sun Hongsheng, the agent of the Gongping Insurance Company.

### The Wife-Seeking Case Involving a Taoist Priest Results in Both Plaintiff and Defendant Absent

Further Summons Awaited

Lin Qisheng, a Taoist priest from Zhitang, Taicang, married Ba Ruibao (25 years old this year), a woman from the same village. They had a son who is now seven or eight years old. In 1934, Ba left home on the pretext of working as a servant in Shanghai and never returned, with no news of her. It was not until last winter that Lin was informed by his brother Ba Yinnan that Ba had remarried in Shanghai to a Zhou who owns a milk shed, introduced by Tang Jinfu, a fellow villager and pimp at No. 149 Xinjiao Street. Lin then went to Shanghai with Ba Yinnan and found her, intending to bring her home. Because they could not catch a train, they stayed overnight at the Hongxiang Hotel on North Nicheng Bridge. The next day, Ba was intercepted by Tang Jinfu and others. Lin then filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Tang Jinfu of interfering with his family. Tang was released on bail pending trial. Ba Ruibao, in turn, filed a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Lin Qisheng of interfering with her freedom and intimidation. She denied marrying Lin. After the First Special Court requested the case files from the Xinzha Police Station, it was confirmed that the plaintiff Ba Ruibao and Lin Qisheng were indeed husband and wife, and the lawsuit was dismissed. Regarding Lin Qisheng's lawsuit against Tang Jinfu in the Second Special Court, the former Criminal Court Judge Wang Gangxu summoned the case for continued hearing. Because the plaintiff did not appear, the hearing was postponed. The day before yesterday, Judge Chen Daqi presided over the continued hearing in Criminal Court One. Because the parties and lawyers were not all present, the court postponed the hearing again.

### Shen Xuezhen Sues for Dissolution of Marriage Contract

Shen Yao, a woman from Chongming, resides at No. 345 Chenjiabang, Aiwenyi Road. Her daughter, Shen Xuezhen, 20 years old, is currently a waitress at the Xian Shi Amusement Park. Shen Yao and Shen Xuezhen, mother and daughter, sued Sha Xiaojiang (26 years old, Shanghai resident, residing behind the Yuyingtang in Zhabei), a fellow villager from Nanshazhai, Shenjiawan, Chongming, in the District Court to confirm the invalidity of the marriage contract. The complaint states that the plaintiff's daughter Xuezhen was engaged to the defendant at the age of fourteen through a matchmaker, but at that time, it was only based on the wishes of her parents, and Xuezhen's consent was not obtained. Now that Xuezhen has grown up, she refuses to recognize the marriage contract to avoid future mistakes. Sha Xiaojiang defended that he and Xuezhen were married in their hometown as early as June 6, 1931, and had a daughter, who unfortunately died seven days later. In 1935, she came to Shanghai to work as a waitress, became accustomed to modern life, and lived a city life, refusing to return home and having ulterior motives, requesting that the original complaint be rejected. Judge Tang Youhua held a hearing yesterday and stated that the preliminary problem in this case is the procedural error. In any case, Shen Xuezhen and Sha Xiaojiang should be the parties, and the mother and daughter cannot be mixed up as parties. At most, they can be agents. The case should be adjusted procedurally and then reviewed.

### Xu Weizhou and Others Sue Yan Ziyu and Others for Fraud

Yan and Others Evade Appearance in Court, Court Approves Arrest Warrants

Xu Weizhou from Wuxi recently hired lawyers Xu Shihao and Zuo Dezhai to sue Yan Ziyu and Chu Wenhao, owners of the Central Cold Storage Plant at No. 185 Bai Lao Hu Road, formerly No. 619 Xinmen Road, for fraud. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao of the First Special Court summoned them. The summonses were sent to Yan Ziyu at No. 2 Dasheng Alley, Xiaodongmen, and Yu Wenhao at No. 28 Zha Pu Road, but were rejected and could not be delivered. Plaintiff Xu Weizhou stated that on March 4, 1935, Yu mortgaged all the equipment, decoration, and machinery in the rented building of the Central Cold Storage Plant for 55,000 yuan, with a term of six months and interest of 750 yuan per month, payable every three months. The defendants failed to repay the loan when it was due and extended the term for another year. Before the expiration of the term, the factory suddenly added the "Youji" company to its business in May 1936. On June 16, Xu, a lawyer, was entrusted to send a letter to negotiate. The defendant wrote back to excuse and prevaricate. After being urged again to clear the debt within a time limit, it was learned that the factory's machinery and equipment had long been sold to the Bank of China and had been involved in litigation. The defendants, knowing it was difficult to conceal, fled and hid to avoid punishment. Therefore, he requested that they be punished according to the law, and incidentally filed a civil suit to recover 55,000 yuan. Lawyer Zuo then pleaded that the defendants had no residence and had long since fled, requesting that they be arrested and severely punished. Judge Ye approved the arrest warrants.

### A Discussion on Why Credit and Labor Should Not Be Calculated as Capital

— Certified Public Accountant Shen Liren

The calculation of capital has become a major topic of discussion in society and something everyone urgently wants to understand since our country began collecting income tax. I, with my limited knowledge, dare to offer some discussion based on what I understand.

In European and American countries, the income tax rate on profit-making income is determined by the amount of net profit, regardless of the size of the capital. Our country is different. The calculation method for this type of income tax rate is based on the ratio between the net profit and the actual amount of capital, determining the level of the tax rate. Therefore, the same amount of net profit requires a certain tax payment for those with smaller capital, while those with larger capital will have a smaller tax rate. As a result, all businesses are vying to increase their capital in order to reduce their tax burden. However, according to the accounting systems of China's industrial and commercial circles, which are known for their complexity, the amount of capital for new-style companies and manufacturers is very easy to obtain. However, for old-style firms that were established decades or even hundreds of years ago, most are sole proprietorships or partnerships, and it is not easy to determine their true capital. The capital of these firms is usually very small, while their annual business is often a hundred times this amount, and their annual net profit is also several times their capital. I ask, how can this huge business and several times the net profit be obtained solely based on this small capital? If we further study the books of these firms, we will know that in addition to their capital, they also have a certain amount of borrowing from various households, and a certain amount of lending from banks and money shops, the total of which is greater than the capital or even dozens of times greater. Then we can understand the origin of this huge net profit. Although these borrowings and lendings are liabilities, in reality, they are the funds used to obtain this huge net profit. Now, let's make a deeper exploration of these borrowings and lendings. The customs of Chinese money shops are mostly specialized in credit lending, and this type of lending has no collateral, so it is naturally based on the normal credit of the firm or its shareholders. Suppose the firm or its shareholders do not have this credit, then the money shop will certainly not be willing to lend, and if the firm needs this amount of money as capital for trade, then its shareholders must find a way to hand over real estate or other valuable securities to the firm for mortgaging to the money shop for the amount of money. From this point of view, the former credit is actually more important than the latter collateral. If shareholders hand over collateral to the firm as operating capital, it can certainly be counted as capital, then the credit equivalent to this collateral can also be counted as capital without a doubt. Article 667 of Section 18 of Book 3 of our country's Civil Code stipulates that "Partners' contributions may be money, other things, or replaced by labor." Article 91 of the Company Law stipulates matters related to share capital, including "Those who use property other than money as share capital, their names and the type and price of their property, and the number of shares approved by the company." It shows that our country's laws also recognize that intangible assets other than money can be used as part of the capital. On the other hand, Article 7 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Income Tax in our country stipulates that "Capital refers to the actual paid-up share capital of corporate organizations or the actual invested capital of other organizations." Furthermore, Item 4 of the Taxpayer Instructions explains that "The so-called capital does not include contributions of credit or labor," etc. After careful examination, it seems unfair. Income tax is based on profit-making income, and profit-making income is generated by the actual paid-up capital and credit. As in the example above, it is impossible to obtain huge profits solely based on capital. Now it is clearly stipulated that in addition to the actual paid-up capital, credit cannot be counted as capital, how can it be said to be fair? Not only that, but it also contradicts economic principles, accounting principles, and our country's Civil Code. Therefore, I secretly think it is not right. I speculate that the intention of the income tax regulations that credit and labor cannot be used as capital is probably because these intangible assets are not easy to calculate accurately during calculation, and they may be overvalued, leading to difficulties in collecting taxes. However, according to accounting principles and precedents in various countries, it is not difficult to find an accurate and scientific calculation method. Here, I specifically cite the 34th precedent of the U.S. Income Tax Review Committee, Committee on Appeals & Reviews A R M34. Its judgment states, "For all legitimate businesses, the profit on tangible assets can be calculated at 8%, while the profit on intangible assets should be calculated at 1.5%. The calculation method is to at least take the average of the profits in the past five years, then deduct the tangible assets calculated at a rate of 1.5%, which is the intangible assets." However, this calculation method is not fixed, because later precedents R R 146 A R R 252 and ARR 2954 have changed slightly, but the calculation method is the same. As for the period when this type of intangible economic asset can be estimated, according to the accounting encyclopedia published in the United States, the valuation of credit can be done when the following matters occur: 1. Business sale, 2. Trademark transfer, 3. Reorganization or merger, 4. Reporting of new capital, 5. Valuation of assets on March 1, 1931, 6. Changes in public utility rates, 7. Changes in partnership shareholders. The above-mentioned item 5, March 1, 1931, is the unified collection of national income tax in the United States, which is equivalent to today when our country began collecting income tax. Therefore, I take advantage of this opportunity to discuss this issue and seek guidance from knowledgeable people in the country.

Spring and Autumn

### A Pair of Shoes

— (Yan Chonglou)

I am no longer prepared to wear the pair of shoes that I have left under my bed; they appear to be worn out, out of shape, and there is even a hole in the sole!

Initially, these shoes had also undergone the careful manufacturing of a craftsman. It took many steps to make them and display them on the shelves of a shoe company. At that time, I saw that their color and style suited my taste, so I chose them from many pairs of shoes and wore them on my feet. I couldn't help but look around and feel pleased with myself. At first, I was reluctant to wear them much. I would only wear them when I had social engagements or when I went out for a walk. Later, as time went on, I wore them more and more often. Whenever it rained, they would follow me through muddy roads. Whenever I traveled, they would follow me through many rugged paths. So, their luster gradually disappeared! Their shape gradually changed! And their heels gradually wore out!…

Finally, they reached this day when they could no longer be used. However, I know that there will be a day when even this dilapidated form cannot be seen!

### The Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Sylvester Conferred Upon Lu Bohong

— Sun Chouchang

The Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Sylvester, conferred this time on Mr. Lu Bohong by Pope Pius XI of Rome, is a first for the Far East. This honor, established by Pope Paul IV in 1555, has been successively bestowed by subsequent Popes on kings of Germany, France, and Spain, among others. Over the centuries, less than ten people worldwide have received this honor, so its prestige is evident. The insignia of the Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Sylvester consists of three items: ㊀ a triple gold necklace, ㊁ the Knight Commander's robes, and ㊂ a blessed sword. After receiving this special honor, one may approach the Pope and serve as a sword-bearing guard, a position even more noble than the First-Class Imperial Guards of the Qing Emperor or the military attendants around the President of the Republic. No wonder Mayor Wu Tiecheng's eulogy contained the lines, "The robes and sword bring harmony, with intentions for his own person. This great honor is unprecedented." The shapes of the three items are described in detail below: ㊀ The triple gold necklace is about three inches wide and over two feet long, with an object hanging down that resembles a butterfly, formed by the Imperial Crown, Grand Cordon, axe, and other objects. The necklace is embedded with large ruby stones, each about half an inch in diameter with a waist-shaped figure, with very bright colors. It is paired with a brocade box made of red silk velvet, divided into two sections. When the Pope's representative, Bishop Cai Ning, takes it out and personally puts it on, the hanging object is appropriately located on the chest after connecting the hooks of the two sections. ㊁ The Knight Commander's robes, made of black silk, are knee-length. The arms have bird-feather cuffs edged with three-inch dogtooth-shaped white lace. The collar is also white, separately assembled and shaped like the turned-down collar of a wool-lined shirt worn in winter, folded into a water-wave pattern, with the lower part folded like a skirt. The hat has a flat top, similar to the black silk velvet hats woven by middle-aged women in our country in recent times, except that it has black fur inserted on the left rear and is inlaid with a sapphire on the front. The shoes are also black, and the sapphire inlaid on the head is about the same size as the one inlaid on the hat, both sparkling with light. There is a black cape on the outside. ㊄ The blessed sword is over three feet long, inlaid with silver on black wood, with a cross on the handle. There is a leather belt around the waist, and another small leather strap to connect the sword, looking very martial, like a knight actor performing on stage. After Bishop Cai Ning, representing the Pope, completed the awarding of the honor, he also delivered a speech in Latin, saying that this honor is the glorious crystallization of Mr. Lu's efforts in charitable work and faith and love. Although he is honored as a papal guard today, he has actually been a guard for the poor for twenty-five years. The New Universal Orphanage, which Mr. Lu advocated for, happens to be celebrating its silver anniversary on this day. The total number of people supported by the orphanage in the past twenty-five years has been more than 110,000, with more than 60,000 people recovering from illness and leaving the orphanage. Outpatient medical treatment and medicine have been provided to more than 2.3 million people, benefiting the poor in no small way. Currently, there are more than 20 courtyards, supporting more than 3,200 men, women, old, young, poor, sick, disabled, orphans, and infants, all of whom receive free clothing, food, and housing. The expenses incurred over the past twenty-five years have reached more than 3.7 million yuan.

### The Muntjacs of Mount Huang

— Yi Mei

The scenery of Mount Huang is renowned throughout Southeast China. Since the opening of the long-distance train lines, traveling a thousand miles is now instantaneous. As a result, those who travel with wax-coated walking sticks flock there incessantly. Xu Zizhong Chun returned from a sightseeing trip and spoke about trivial matters, which are worth recording; he said, "Mount Huang has three 'no's.'" First, there are no mosquitoes, so one can be naked on hot days without worry. Second, there is no rice; rice is transported from Taiping County, which is over a hundred miles away. Third, there is no wine. Those who crave wine must rely on Shuangxi and other places in Zhongjiao Village, and the villagers carry wine for sale every day without interruption. Goods are transported by donkey. At dusk, the sight of the donkeys walking among the trees on the slopes is like a painting. In steep places, the locals use bamboo sedan chairs to carry guests, calling them "seahorses" to imply their agility. When one is in the bamboo sedan chair, the ears are filled with the sounds of birds, melodious like playing reed instruments. The bird is named Fairy Music and hides deep in the bamboo reeds, so one cannot see what color it is. The pine trees are all densely packed, with names such as Greeting Guest, Farewell Guest, Solemn, Padded Seat, Mandarin Duck, Beautiful Hermit, Flying Crane, Azure Dragon, Black Tiger, Phoenix, Father and Son, Sisters, etc. Most of them are named for their resemblance to the objects. There are many muntjacs in the mountains. The muntjac is a spiritual creature; the male has short horns, and its eyes are shaped like tilted squares. Tao Yuanming wrote in his poem, "Short fences surround the muntjac's eyes," referring to the square shape of the woven fences. Its fur is brown, its legs are short and strong, and it is good at jumping. Its leather is soft and can be used to make gloves, watch pockets, etc. It can be used to wipe crystal to avoid traces. Its meat can be eaten and is no different from venison, but its value is very low, about eighty cents per head. When raised, its nature is very docile. A month ago, a hunter named so-and-so went out with a gun early in the morning, accompanied by a dog, to hunt muntjacs. Suddenly, he saw a speckled object in a cliff crevice, suspecting it was a snake. He poked it with the gun barrel, but unexpectedly a leopard stood up imposingly. The speckled object was its tail. The hunter was frightened and at a loss. The leopard pounced directly at him. Just as he was in danger, the dog suddenly rushed forward and bit the leopard's thigh. The leopard turned around and fought with the dog, and the hunter was finally able to raise his gun and fire, killing the leopard. However, the dog was exhausted and seriously injured, and soon died as well. The hunter was very saddened by this, saying."

### Curtain

— Bo Guang

The curtain, imbued with mystery, is just a few feet of white or patterned cloth. The most elaborate are the woven raised-pattern curtains. If it blocks the door, strangers should not lift the curtain and enter, especially in brothels where the rules are very strict.

In the past, the doors of Fujian houses were always hung with curtains that were not rolled up all day. Although modern times advocate for equality between men and women, after removing the curtain, they still use screens as barriers so that everything can be covered up.

One day, I was chatting casually at the home of a certain committee member. Mr. Ye came with a card to meet the committee member, but there was only a screen separating them. The committee member ordered the tea servant to report that he was not in. If it were me, I would definitely question the tea servant for lying, because the person coming to see the committee member had already seen the committee member's head from outside the screen. This excuse is too embarrassing.

On another occasion, a certain woman created a love triangle and used the window curtain to alienate the third party. She was very clever. She first went to the man's study with a close friend and brought down a letter that read, "Meet at 10 PM tonight." In the evening, she first asked her sister-in-law to go through the process of writing the letter, while she stood with her in the distance, watching. The room had bright electric lights, and a beautiful figure was revealed on the snow-white window curtain. The woman's means of alienating people are truly powerful! If it weren't for this window curtain, perhaps this method could not have been used? However, the woman who was deceived by her lost her love and tasted the greatest pain in life. Before long, she died!

### Good Material

Little Spring and Autumn

### Opportunity

— (Fei)

Only those who are diligent and frugal will encounter opportunities and make use of them. Lazy people will never encounter opportunities, because even if they do encounter them, they will neglect them.

For example, when fishing, if you take your hook and rod every day and wait quietly by the river, you will one day catch a big fish. But it is impossible for you to walk by the river without a rod or hook and have a big fish flop into your palm.

For example, when mining, if you dig in the ravine day and night, you may one day discover a gold mine. But it is impossible for you to walk on the road and have gold poke your toe.

### Birds of Yuyao

— Old Man Qinghe

Yuyao borders the river and the sea, with fertile plains, and is known for its birds. There are many fine species worth mentioning.

Bamboo Charm: There are many bamboo gardens in the northern countryside of Yuyao. Although they are not the thousand acres of the Wei River, they have thousands or tens of thousands of bamboo stalks. In the deep and dense bamboo forests, there are often colorful birds, the size of swallows, slender in shape, with tails nearly a foot long, and shiny, mottled feathers, which are lovely. The locals call them Bamboo Charms or Twin Flower Birds. I have seen three in the bamboo garden of the Lu family in Dulin, and the colors of their feathers were different.

Emerald Bird: The emerald bird, also known as the fish dog, is a wading bird that lives by the water. It is no smaller than a duck in length, but its legs are taller. The southwest of my family's tidal pond faces the river, and there are many shallow streams in the water where the pond turns. In my childhood, I saw this bird wading and searching for food in the water. Today, because there are too many hunters, the feathers on top of the emerald bird's head are almost the same price as gold, and other feathers are also valuable, while the top feathers are bought by foreigners. Western women's hats use these feathers as decorations, considering them to be treasures. Now this bird is also becoming less and less common, and one can only occasionally see it.

### I Am Not as Good as You

— (Ying)

After the Opium War, Guan Tianpei, the Guangdong naval commander, died in the line of duty and was ordered to have a special ancestral hall built for him. Later, because of the peace talks, Lin Zexu was exiled. When Lord Lin was sent into exile, the Guan ancestral hall had just been completed. He openly wrote the four characters "I am not as good as you" to highlight Guan's merits. The wording is very kind and appropriate, and there is blood and tears in it.

Chairman Lin Sen, also known as Qingzhi Old Man, built Qingzhi Villa near Qingzhi Temple on Baidong Mountain, Lianjiang. The furnishings in the villa reflect the flavor of a farmer's home, and I often talked with him in the villa. I then casually composed a seven-character quatrain as follows: Baidong Mountain at the head of the Lianli River, the fragrance of Qingzhi is sent along the clear stream. The old man is an old friend, and fairy tales of mulberry and hemp are here. (Pillow Stream Hermit Tong Hangshi)

### Chaozhou Dialect

— Chen Tianci

Last winter, a Chaozhou classmate and I went to a bookstore on Fourth Avenue to buy books. We passed a Chaozhou restaurant, and my classmate, feeling nostalgic for his hometown, insisted that I join him for a meal of Chaozhou cuisine, a "ten-scene" hot pot. I couldn't refuse, so I went in with him.

At the time, he said a few words in the local dialect to the waiter, and the waiter nodded and went away. Who knew that we waited for a quarter of an hour and the dishes we ordered still hadn't arrived. I couldn't help but get anxious, so I used the local Shanghai dialect to call the waiter and urge him to hurry. But when I said this, the waiter just glared at me, as if he was ignoring me. I was completely baffled. Fortunately, my classmate said "slower" to him, and he nodded and left.

Later, I asked my classmate why, and he told me that the Chaozhou word for "slower" means "faster" in Shanghai dialect. I was speechless.

### A Sketch of the Municipal Museum

— Ying Dai

Undoubtedly, this is a grand building in Shanghai, and within this grand building are many items that represent a history of Shanghai and rare artistic masterpieces. To the left of the Municipal Government, the Municipal Museum is finally officially open for public viewing.

This magnificent new building is located on the left side of the front of the government, with Huashang Fifth Road public buses carrying batches of visitors to the front of the museum. I was, of course, one of them. Although there were pairs of stone figures and horses, as well as other decorations, on the lawn at the entrance, I did not want to see these. I just couldn't wait to step into the museum.

The building is I-shaped with a palace-style roof, and on both sides, two party-state flags are fluttering in the sunlight. Walking into this solemn and grand museum in the cold wind, it is of course much warmer inside, and you can immediately feel the significant difference in temperature between inside and outside. As I walked in, the ceilings, walls, etc., that came into my sight all had an artistic flair, and the lighting in the room was so soft, it really made me feel as if I had stepped into a palace of art.

Mingling in the crowd, I entered the first exhibition hall. The first thing that caught my eye were eleven Gu embroidery screen panels, hung on the walls on both sides. Indeed, Gu Ji of Shanghai's Luxiang Garden was famous both at home and abroad, and no embroidery could be more delicate and exquisite. The square stone inscription is a maxim given by Lu Wenyu, a virtuous man from this city in the Ming Dynasty, to his nephew Huang Liangqi. In between, a Ming Dynasty gilded Buddha statue represents the modern carving industry. By the way, in the first and second exhibition corridors, I also saw many things about Shanghai literature, and relics of the Confucius Temple. Entering the third exhibition hall, the various models and items seen here represent the evolution and changes of Shanghai's industry and commerce throughout the dynasties.

Taking the escalator to the second floor, is the third exhibition hall. Inside are colorful Qing Dynasty wedding dresses embroidered with patterns, and a wooden new bed, a product from Fenghua, the hometown of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. And in a glass cabinet for shoes and socks, straw sandals, old cloth shoes, cloth socks, etc., everything is collected, and the models of hairpins from various dynasties made the women who saw them laugh. The third and fourth exhibition corridors are arranged on the left and right of the second floor. One side displays old-fashioned jewelry and clothing accessories used by women throughout the dynasties, even several bronze mirrors are displayed. The other side displays copper coins ranging from one to five hundred wen, various silver coins, various banknotes, especially stamps, stamps from all over China and overseas countries. Among them, there is even one of the earliest Shanghai stamps, printed by the Customs in 1878, with a dragon printed on it. The fourth, fifth, and sixth exhibition rooms are side by side, on the second floor facing the front door. Various stone tools, jade tools, bronze tools, pottery, porcelain, lacquerware, bamboo and wood tools, calligraphy and paintings, etc., are all rare treasures, especially various fossils, which were collected by archaeologists in Zhoukoudian, and are ancient objects left over from the adult era.

Going up to the third floor, is the fifth corridor. This area is surrounded by ancient murals, and several old pictures of the Old Summer Palace will make us think of the splendor of the palace architecture in the imperial era, and the pity of being burned by the Allied forces during the Boxer Rebellion! Going up another floor, is the roof of the museum, where only various architectural models of the city center area are displayed, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Sports Field, the Municipal Swimming Pool, the Municipal Library, and even the Municipal Museum, everything is made lifelike. By the way, looking at the entire city center from the platform, taking a bird's eye view, all the buildings are taken into my eyes.

### The Transformed Nest

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter 10 (A Silk Handkerchief Sends Coded Messages, An Excellent Essay is Misunderstood; Yellow Flowers Face a Withered Autumn, Adding Sorrow to the Autumn Letter)

Three days passed, but Youmei did not come. The letter to Menglan, which had been placed in the drawer, had not yet been delivered, and he did not dare to send it through the post office again without permission. This really made Guoqi feel a bit depressed. On the fourth day, he could no longer bear it. He called Aunt Liu to the study and asked: What did Miss Li say when she left that day? Aunt Liu said: She didn't say anything. Guoqi said "Oh." He sat at the desk, picked up a book, and flipped through it casually, his eyes on the book, seemingly unintentionally, and asked again: Did…did…he couldn't help but blush a little as he said this. Aunt Liu smiled: If there's anything you need, sir, don't hesitate. I'll take a trip to Miss Li's house, that's all. Guoqi didn't say anything, just kept flipping through the pages of the book. Aunt Liu said: There's nothing difficult about it. I'll go to the Li Mansion after lunch. Guoqi said: Actually, I don't need anything. Aunt Liu stood by the table, smiling, looking at Guoqi intently. Guoqi said: It's up to you whether you go or not. If you really want to go, you can't let the old lady know. Because I don't need anything. Although Aunt Liu couldn't quite understand what he meant, she guessed that he didn't seem to object to her going to the Li's house. She answered softly and walked out of the room. Guoqi didn't seem to care much about this matter and casually read his book at the desk. After lunch! He took a nap. When he woke up, Aunt Liu brought in two books and handed them to him, saying: Miss Li said, she's borrowing the books from you, sir, and asked me to bring them back. Guoqi took the books, and there was a letter on the cover, so he said: Alright? I understand. He put the books on the table for now, and after Aunt Liu left, he opened the letter. There was only one eight-line letter paper inside, with only a few words on it: Mei is suffering from heatstroke and has been unable to visit your mansion for several days to inquire. Sincerely regretful. If there is an opportunity to pass something on to the front, please have Aunt Qing send any book over, and the letter can be brought along. Mei is always serious and will never make mistakes. After reading the letter, Guoqi thought about it for a while and understood very well that it must be because she looked at the note carefully after returning home and realized it was her own misunderstanding. To come again would be a bit embarrassing. It's hard for a man to have his advances rejected like this. It would be quite a joke for a young lady to misunderstand and write a love letter to someone. Thinking of this, Guoqi felt sorry for Youmei. He could only let this matter pass vaguely. If he wrote to Youmei himself to say that it was a misunderstanding and she shouldn't mind, it would make her even more upset. (126)

Commentary

### The Sorrow of National Subjugation

— Tian Yu

It is reported that the Italian Consulate in Shanghai protested against the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road for showing newsreels of Abyssinia. After seeing this news, a wave of sorrow for national subjugation could not help but strongly strike my heart.

According to the newspaper, the film records Abyssinia's mineral resources, terrain, the suffering of farmers, and a section of the military fighting between Italian cars, purely a newsreel that does not contain any effect. In Shanghai, China, tens of thousands of miles away from the Abyssinian homeland, such films are not allowed to exist. Then the lives of the Abyssinian people under the direct rule of Italy are in an unimaginable and tragic situation, which is self-evident. However, according to Mr. Mussolini's statement, his conquest of Abyssinia was to liberate the Abyssinian people under the rule of the Abyssinian Emperor, and to spread white civilization to the semi-civilized black African country! This is the most sacred right given to him by God. We now know that God's sacredness is a cruel force that eats people!

After seeing such news, what should we, whose situation is no better than that of the people of Abyssinia, which has now been subjugated, think?

"Our ally" is also working hard to spread its "Royal Way civilization" on the lost four northeastern provinces of our country. It is said that in the "Manchukuo National Anthem" formulated under their command, there are two sentences: "Thirty million people, without suffering and without worry." We are really worried day and night that this blessing of "no suffering and no worry" will unknowingly have already descended on the heads of our people who have not yet entered the "Land of Royal Way". Soon, we will also follow the thirty million people of Manchuria who have been baptized by the blood of Royal Way civilization and sing loudly: "Four hundred and fifty million people, without suffering and without worry!" This is definitely not a nonsensical fantasy, but a fact that can be realized at any time.

At that time, I imagined: If there is also a film company of a friendly country, such as the Soviet film news factory that is currently shooting newsreels of Abyssinia, that films our mineral mountains, terrain, and newly built palaces in Nanjing and Shanghai, as well as the continued resistance of the righteous army, etc., then the North Sichuan Road, of course, is already a part of the Land of Royal Way and cannot be shown again. The Shanghai Grand Theater may not exist at that time. The place of screening may be London in England or New York in the United States. At that time, will our ally also lodge a formal protest with Britain and the United States? Whether or not they protest is not the question. In short, we ourselves will never have the pleasure of seeing our beautiful motherland on the screen again. Unless another group of wealthy people have already rolled up their wealth before the subjugation of the country and fled to England or the United States, settling down as expatriates, perhaps they can still sit leisurely in the cinemas of London or New York, watching the pitiful motherland that they have long forgotten being shown on the screen.

Many years ago, as I watched the tragedies depicting the fate of our older brother, Korea, who took the first step in subjugation, hot tears streamed down, and the sparks of resistance were poured into my young heart. But unexpectedly, more than ten years later, we are quickly embarking on the same dead end as that soon-to-be-dead older brother. Watching the news that the Italian Consulate protested the screening of Abyssinian newsreels at the Shanghai Grand Theater, a wave of sorrow for national subjugation could not help but strongly strike my heart!

### Reflections on "The Devil of Desire"

— Li Yi

Amateur actors perform at the Carlton

With ardent anticipation, I watched the trial performance of "The Devil of Desire". Perhaps it was because my expectations were too extravagant and my love was too deep that what I want to say about the public performance of "The Devil of Desire" is "bad things" rather than good things. Although from the current environment, encouragement should be more important than criticism, and it seems that praise and criticism should be mixed in order to be fair, I don't think so here. I want to speak as an audience member and give my reflections on the performance as a reference for my "amateur" friends.

Mr. Ouyang said this about the script in his "Miscellaneous Thoughts on Directing The Devil of Desire": "The first three acts are not much different from the original, and the fourth and fifth acts have been adapted somewhat. The original work had too much religious flavor, and its solution to the problem was quite different from the modern spirit. The revised translation may not have made great progress, because complete adaptation is not very possible. The story has been changed to be Chinese, the religious atmosphere has been removed as much as possible, and some life, human relationships and environmental reasons have been added."

I really know too little about Tolstoy, so little that I don't even qualify as an apprentice. But "The Devil of Desire"

## Page 18

I think the significance of the performance should exceed accepting "the accumulated techniques of past experience and genius". Accepting the legacy is naturally what we need, but from my utilitarian point of view, I think this is secondary. The most important thing is how to connect drama with the current era: I can't remember who said it, but at the moment, even without machine guns, even a broadsword is good. I am an advocate of this sentence. I think that if there are extraordinary achievements in skills, it is better to have more achievements in meaning. What's more, amateur actors are a troupe with a large audience, and they should be more considerate of the meaning of their performances.

"The Devil of Desire" has been revised by Mr. Ouyang. I have not seen the original, but it is said that the religious atmosphere was too heavy, and now some life, human relationships, and environmental reasons have been added as much as possible. However, after watching the performance of "The Devil of Desire", I seemed to still see Tolstoy's shadow, standing on the stage, preaching to the vast audience. This makes me have to say some of the disappointing words above.

In "The Devil of Desire", we can appreciate Tolstoy's curse on the private property system, but what we feel more is "conscience". Here, we hear emphasized several times, "God will punish", "You can deceive people, but you can't deceive God". In the end, it was the appearance of Li Qi's father that relieved Li Qi's mental pain and ended the play by "heroically" revealing his secret. What kind of effect will such an ending have in objective effect? In China, where the feudal demons have not yet been killed and the general backward audience is still obsessed with believing in karma, I really dare not think about it. Although the intellectual level of the current drama audience is quite high, and the audience of "amateurs" is mostly educated to a secondary level, but as the general public is gradually paying attention to drama, and our goal is to go deep into the people, such an ending is really too dangerous.

The director and the adapter are the same person, so it is impossible to tell whether this is the case in the script or the director is doing so. I think that in terms of directing, the emphasis on money and the environment is not strong enough, and the director exaggerated the several "conscience theories" of Li Qi's father, who represented the spirit of the original author. This may be precisely where the original script is not easy to change, but in terms of objective effect, it will not be of greater benefit to the audience.

I had seen a secret trial performance before this trial performance. In terms of performance skills, not only did I not feel bored, but I was also more interested. This is enough to prove the superiority and progress in skills. When I watched it last time, I felt that the tone was too loose and flat. This time, it was much tighter, but in my opinion, it can still be tightened a bit, and I believe that it will definitely be tighter in the official performance.

The acting skills of the actors are really pleasing. It can be said that no one is below the standard. They are all so hardworking, realistic and natural, not like they are acting, but they vividly bring each character to life in front of you. This should be the greatest harvest of this performance of "The Devil of Desire", a harvest worth praising. If I were to give examples, then I can cite Ying Yin, Wei Heling, Wang Weiyi, and Zhang Manping as representatives.

The set design is quite good, but the lighting is a bit unstable and too flashing. The sound effects cannot be considered bad, but if more attention can be paid to the sound of the wind, it would be better.

Finally, near the end of the fifth act, I would like to ask Mr. Zheng Junli and the director to pay attention to one thing, that is, don't let the actions of the silly son-in-law (played by Zheng Junli) overwhelm the audience's laughter under the stage, otherwise, the ending of this tragedy will have the opposite effect. Like the trial performance I saw this time, Mr. Xiang Junli played very well and was able to adapt to the situation and divert the audience's attention. If he can suppress the audience's laughter even more in the future, it will naturally be even better.

### Only Asking to be Buried Together After Death

— Yin Fei

I often think this way: We Chinese value death more than life. Before death, one can be very frugal, even unwilling to spend a penny, but after death, one must be extravagant. This extravagance, such as sixty-four carriers carrying the coffin through the streets, and filial sons and virtuous grandsons lighting the main lamp, is not entirely the intention of the filial sons and virtuous grandsons. Naturally, in order to gain the reputation of filial and virtuous, and for the sake of appearances, the filial sons and virtuous grandsons cannot make the funeral too shabby. But extravagance requires more money, which cannot but be a little painful, but one cannot violate the last wish, so as to be talked about behind one's back, saying things like "He worked hard all his life, shouldn't he spend a few more dollars after his death?"

Because of the importance attached to death, many people who are not yet thirty years old are managing "longevity lands", which is very common. There is also a reason for this, called "Prepare longevity materials at three years old, you can use them when you get old." Originally, can people avoid death? Watching the long resting place that you personally manage being completed according to your own wishes, you can close your eyes even when you die.

As for the reason why this kind of psychology has arisen and has taken root in people's hearts, it is because they regard death as permanent rest, and life as "a reverse journey of life". Therefore, in the short journey, they are busy preparing for "eternity". So death has also become a relief, a thing to be congratulated on.

And the old women who regarded being a slave to men as a matter of course were willing to give up happiness in life, and only wanted to be able to have the name of husband and wife after death, and to be buried together, they would be satisfied.

According to reports, a middle school teacher named Zhu recently became engaged to a Miss Fan because of love. This was originally a happy event, but the Zhu family had been married in his hometown. He could not have both fish and bear's paw. He proposed the idea of divorce to his wife, and voluntarily offered to give her 1,000 mu of land. As a result, the condition for divorce was established, but it was not to accept the "thousand mu of fertile land", but to "request that the two be buried together after death".

A couple without love simply agreed to the difficult marriage, and even did not want the "thousand mu of fertile land". This move is worthy of our respect. However, judging from the point of "requesting that the two be buried together after death", the wife of this Mr. Zhu is not a new woman. The reason why she did not want "thousand mu of fertile land" was not because she knew that women are also human beings, and that their lives should be exchanged by their own efforts, and should not be given or rewarded by others for free to live. Her contempt for the "thousand mu of fertile land" and only seeking to be buried together after death was probably because she regarded "life" as a "reverse journey", and "death" as "eternity", and the old moral concepts of "being loyal to one person" and "marrying a husband" were also at play behind her. Therefore, she would rather sacrifice her own happiness in life to selfishly fulfill her husband's love with others.

From old to new, the distance in between is quite far. If you want to approach it, it is naturally not impossible, but the starting point should be two, that is, from "death" to "life". Otherwise, you will only run further and further down the road to death. This is not only the case with "only seeking to be buried together after death". To put it more broadly, whether the future of the nation is going down the road to "death" or the road to "life" can also be seen from this.

### Afterthoughts

To the Lido and Moonlight Troupes: According to a letter from the Yuanchang Radio Station, your troupes did not make prior contact but immediately submitted programs. If this is not a deliberate attempt to borrow a name or for other purposes, please consider your own integrity and the entire singing community, which is in imminent danger. We hope you will come forward and say something, instead of hiding in the dark and gloating over your cleverness. The truth will eventually come out!

### "Number Rhymes" in "Sunrise"

Only Li Dizhi in all of Shanghai's theatrical circles can sing it

Cao Yu's "Sunrise," Act III, is set in the most degraded brothel in northern China. It's late at night, and a tragic drama of the buying and selling of flesh is unfolding. (At the end of this act, "Little Thing" will hang herself.) Outside the door, the wind howls, and various peddlers selling snacks and newspapers, beggars, and men singing "number rhymes" repeatedly call out to the girls inside for money. "Number rhymes" are a purely northern art form (perhaps similar to the southern "Lotus Flower Drop"?). The sound is mournful and tragic, and combined with the miserable atmosphere in the low-class brothel, it's simply a depiction of human hell.

The "Drama Workshop" put a lot of effort into rehearsing this act in order to complete the tragic atmosphere that should be in the play, especially since there was almost no one in Shanghai's theatrical circles who could sing "number rhymes". They searched everywhere before they found a Li Dizhi.

The name Li Dizhi is probably not unfamiliar to the audience, right? He is a young man who grew up in the north, with a strong physique, a long beard, and a passionate and sincere demeanor. He has acted in many plays in northern theater troupes for a long time. Not long ago, he played very important roles in the Star Film Company's new films "Life and Death in the Same Heart" and "Qingming Season". His calm acting proves the richness of his life experience. Now he has joined the "Drama Workshop" and plays the beggar who sings "number rhymes" in "Sunrise".

Because Li Dizhi is considered a "unique treasure" among Shanghai's stage performers when it comes to singing "number rhymes," he has been given the honorable title of "Number Rhyme Expert" in the "Drama Workshop".

### Recent News from the Forties

The performance committee of the "Forties" Drama Society has decided to present "Sai Jinhua" and "Qiu Jin" in Beijing at the beginning of the Lunar New Year. It is said that everything has been arranged, and it has been decided that after the performance in Nanjing, they will return to Shanghai for another run.

The performance committee of the "Forties" Drama Society has decided to rename "Free Soul" to "Qiu Jin" to make it more popular. Another reason is to allow these two female heroes to meet the people of the capital at the same time.

The "Forties" Drama Society has been rehearsing intensely for days. The actors know that the performance is approaching soon, so they are very enthusiastic during rehearsals. It is said that the prologue of "Qiu Jin" has already taken shape.

### The "New Year Money" Scene

### Star Symphony

"New Year Money" is a story of life's joys and sorrows that unfolds from the clue of a piece of New Year's money given to a child by an elder. The plot is very novel and the depiction is very profound. The film has been completely finished and is scheduled to be released in the Lunar New Year as a New Year's gift from Star Film Company to the audience.

Xu Xinfu's detective blockbuster "Lively Dragon and Fierce Tiger" is a large-scale production set in the Northeast. It is tense and exciting, and more novel and meaningful than ordinary detective films. The interior scenes have been completed, and the crew will go to Suzhou in the coming days to film the scene of a major battle between the military and bandits.

Cheng Bugao's new work "Long Night, Many Dreams," following "Little Lingzi," is about to begin work, starring Tan Ying, with a script by the famous writer Hong Shen.

Shen Xiling's "Crossroads" has six characters as the main thread of the story, all of whom are intellectuals.

### "Whimsical Thoughts"

—Theme song of "A Match Made in Heaven"—

The theme song of "A Match Made in Heaven" is called "Whimsical Thoughts," with lyrics by Tan Meisheng, music by Sha Mei, and sung by Han Langen. The lyrics are as follows:

I don't care if the echoes are buzzing,

I'm not working today!

It's like a fish escaping the net,

Like a bird leaving the cage!

Working every day until late,

My head is dizzy and my muscles ache!

Finally, there's today,

A free day.

The boss even said he'd increase my pay,

I wonder if he'll actually do it!

Great day, great day,

It's so pitiful to be alone!

Relatives and friends don't know me,

My grandpa already passed away!

There's only one girl living over there,

Honey, she seems to be very attached to me!

God in Heaven, you have eyes,

Grant us our marriage,

Not only will I treat you to red eggs right away;

But also the wedding feast for my son tomorrow,

I'll put you in the seat of honor,

Let's play a few rounds of finger-guessing games!
