### Nine-Power Treaty Conference Discusses Second Declaration; Our Representative Delivers a Solemn Speech

Hoping All Nations Will Not Forget Joint Efforts to Uphold the Treaty; The Declaration Reaffirms Various Principles of Reconciliation

Brussels - During the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the chief Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, issued an urgent appeal for assistance to China and strongly criticized the draft report summarizing the discussions of the past three weeks. Gu stated that the report only reiterates general principles and reserves the right to propose substantial amendments, as the common attitude advocated by various countries in the first declaration has now completely failed to materialize. Furthermore, the various concrete measures he appealed for to strengthen China's resistance are not even mentioned. The report, drafted by the British and American delegations, is generally passive in nature. The historical part reportedly mentions the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but without any action or individual assistance to China as in the League of Nations resolutions. Moreover, the report stipulates that the conference will be adjourned to allow countries to exchange views and seek peaceful solutions. However, the adjournment should not be interpreted as a lack of attention to the Far Eastern events by various countries. Finally, the report stipulates that the conference can be reconvened by the chairman or any member. After lengthy discussions on the report at yesterday's meeting, it was adjourned until Wednesday, allowing the Chinese delegation to consult with its government. A second meeting is expected on Wednesday before the closing can be announced. In his speech yesterday, the chief Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, stated that the current conflict in the Far East is clearly an act of one country violating treaties with other countries. Therefore, the task of the conference is equally clear: to consider the common attitude that various countries should adopt in this situation. The Chinese delegation is also deeply aware that declarations are no substitute for action, and without active measures, whether direct or indirect, all declarations and resolutions, no matter how sincere in spirit, will have no practical effect. What the events of the past two years have shown is that although countries have the will to maintain law and order in international relations, they are hesitant or refuse to actively support concerted action. As a result, they have not only failed to prevent but have also contributed to the promotion of violence and disorder. Gu also recounted China's efforts over the past four years to resolve the situation peacefully, stating that China's resources are extremely limited, so the results of its efforts must also be correspondingly meager. However, it can be declared to all countries that China will continue to strive, not only fulfilling its obligations as a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but also fulfilling its duty as a peace-loving nation in the international community. All other countries, except one, have declared that the war in the Far East is legally related to all parties to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and in fact, to all countries in the international community. At this point, Gu said, "With the unlimited resources and power of your countries, can you not take some active action, even if indirect, to do your part in maintaining law and order and the security and peace of the world? Do you still believe that simple statements of principles and the highest declarations of good faith are sufficient? Does your refusal to help China mean that you want China to stop resisting or that you believe China can continue to resist indefinitely without substantial strength?" Gu further stated that unity of will must be followed by unity of action. China firmly believes that it has the right to demand that all signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty work together, not only to ensure that the treaty is respected but also for the sake of justice, order, and world peace. Finally, Gu stated that he reserves the right to propose amendments in order to request specific instructions from his government. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)

Brussels - The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a plenary session at 5:00 PM today, during which the draft second declaration jointly proposed by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France was submitted for discussion. Its content advocated an indefinite adjournment but allowed for the conference to be reconvened if requested by one or two countries when necessary. The chief Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, first delivered a solemn speech, stating that this draft declaration did not mention a word about the common attitude stipulated in the last paragraph of the first declaration, and its content merely reiterated some general principles, which was disappointing. The hasty and fruitless conclusion of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference only "increases the general feeling of unease." After Gu's speech, none of the other country representatives followed with speeches. The meeting then decided at 7:15 PM to continue the meeting at 3:00 PM on the 24th to discuss the draft declaration and the draft report. At that time, Gu Weijun of China will propose amendments to each of the drafts based on the instructions of the Chinese government. It is generally believed that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will announce an indefinite adjournment on the 24th, which is virtually a certainty. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)

Brussels - Although the representatives of various countries listened attentively to the speech delivered by the chief Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, during yesterday's Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it is feared that it will be difficult to produce results. The French representative pointed to Gu and said, "Although this person's words are irrefutable, we are really powerless." The content of this report is still kept secret, and the number of copies issued is extremely limited, and all are numbered. The report is divided into two parts: the first part is the historical part, and the second part is the general assembly declaration. The historical part was discussed yesterday afternoon and passed in principle. Its content is a direct record of all events before the convening of the conference, with the opinions and answers of the representatives and the previous declaration as appendices. The second part is divided into thirteen chapters, solemnly declaring that international instruments are the backbone of guaranteeing security and peace, and stating that China's military actions are entirely self-defense. Any solution imposed by one country on another by means of coercion can never lead to a just and lasting peace, and any solution must consider the various relevant rights and interests. The declaration also denounces the advocacy of direct negotiations and insists that the war should be ended as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)

Brussels - During yesterday's plenary session of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, there was only one point worthy of attention: the speech delivered by the chief Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, who strongly protested that the conference had been discussing for three weeks without achieving any satisfactory results. The conference then submitted the report and draft declaration jointly proposed by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France for discussion. The report is divided into eleven sections, which describe the progress of the conference and serve as a preface to the declaration. Its main points have been approved in principle. The first eight paragraphs trace the circumstances of the convening of the conference and its achievements. The ninth paragraph concerns the future and has not yet been approved. Its general idea is that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference cannot continue its work due to the difference of opinion with Japan. The tenth paragraph states the note sent by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to the Japanese government on November 7, and the eleventh paragraph states the first declaration issued by the conference on November 15. As for the Japanese government's reply, it will be included as an appendix. In addition, due to the chief Chinese representative Gu Weijun's declaration that he intends to propose amendments, it is inconvenient to analyze the draft declaration immediately. After discussing this amendment tomorrow, the conference will announce an indefinite adjournment. After that, it can still be convened by the chairman or by two member states, and the task undertaken by the conference will not be lifted as a result. In particular, if China requests that the case be transferred to the League of Nations for review, it should be granted. This is because the Mexican representative Fabella, who was not very satisfied with the work of the conference, has advocated transferring it to the League of Nations for handling. As for the British and French representatives, they will adopt the same attitude as the U.S. delegation. The chief U.S. representative, Davis, will leave for home as soon as the conference is adjourned. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)

### Our Representative Actively Strives, Still Hoping for Assistance of Arms from Various Countries

British House of Commons Discusses the Issue of Assisting China; Italian Assistance Claimed to Be a Misunderstanding

Brussels - The Associated Press obtained reliable information today that the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, is currently hoping to obtain secret arms assistance from certain countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The Chinese representative's adoption of a delaying policy at the conference is to cover up these negotiations. On Wednesday, Gu may propose amendments to the conference's second declaration, requesting countries to assist China with arms and loans, and perhaps impose sanctions on Japan. However, it is understood that China does not hope for success, but only hopes to use this diplomatic pressure to get Britain, the United States, France, and Russia to guarantee arms assistance. (National Telegram on the 23rd)

[London] - Labour MP Henderson raised the issue of assisting China in the House of Commons today. Henderson asked Foreign Secretary Eden whether the British government had considered individually assisting China in accordance with the League of Nations resolution of October 6, whether it had notified the United States of the scope of assistance, and stated that within this scope, the United States could obtain the full cooperation of Britain. Eden apologized for this issue, saying that decisions are made almost daily on the first part of the question, but it is impossible to provide a detailed report. He further stated that the goal sought by the parties concerned is to agree to stop the Sino-Japanese war, which is also the working basis of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which has not yet adjourned. Regarding the latter part of the question, Eden said that this is a matter of individual action, so although Britain is extremely willing to maintain close contact with the United States on all Far Eastern situations, this matter does not require cooperation with other countries. Henderson further asked whether the British government was prepared to assist China to the same extent as the United States. Eden said that before replying, he hoped to submit a written question. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)

[London] - The News Chronicle reported today that the financial facilities enjoyed by Japan in Britain will gradually be restricted. This is not instructed by the government, but is a matter of banking prudence. Japan's bank credit in London has reached millions of pounds in recent months, but is now only one million pounds. Japan's trade turnover in London is about four million pounds. Japan's credit in London is between five million and six million pounds, and its investment is two million pounds. (National Telegram on the 23rd)

[Rome] - Chen Gongbo, former Minister of Industry of China, stayed here for a week and has now departed for this capital. Here, he met with reporters and said that China will subsequently accept Italian arms assistance. This statement aroused considerable surprise among people here. The Italian authorities declared that Chen's words were likely caused by some misunderstanding. (Haitong dispatch on the 23rd)

[Washington] - Neutralist Senators such as Nye have consolidated their ranks today, planning to make President Roosevelt implement the Neutrality Act. Nye believes that this Congress will be able to take action, because the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is only embarrassing the United States. The United States should know that such meetings will not achieve anything. The United States participated in the last war because of its business relations with other countries. Now the United States is delaying the implementation of the Neutrality Act because of its trade with Japan, which is being obstructed midway. (National Telegram on the 22nd)

### Japan's Declaration of War on China

Government and Military Cautiously Researching

Tokyo - General Sueyoshi's suggestion to Prime Minister Konoe yesterday on a tough policy towards China has attracted attention from all sides. Since China is maintaining a long-term war of resistance against Japan, the issue of formally declaring war is still under consideration in terms of how to deal with or resolve the war situation. In the future, the government, the military, and the cabinet counselors will likely study this issue with a cautious attitude. (Domei dispatch on the 23rd)

Tokyo - The informal meeting between the government and cabinet counselors was held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 22nd. On the government side, Prime Minister Konoe and all cabinet members attended. On the counselor side, all counselors attended except for Matsuoka and 榔. First, the Army and Navy ministers reported on the recent war situation. Then, Foreign Minister Hirota explained the diplomatic situation regarding the Nine-Power Conference and the China Incident. Afterwards, everyone exchanged various opinions and adjourned at around 4:00 PM. (Domei dispatch on the 23rd)

### British House of Commons Discusses Shanghai Concession Issue

Members' Questions Quite Pointed; Foreign Secretary Eden's Reply Cautious

[London] - There were various questions in the House of Commons today regarding the situation in the Shanghai International Settlement, which shows the deep attention of members of Parliament to the situation in Shanghai. Labour MP Ben asked first, asking Foreign Secretary Eden to state that the administration of the International Settlement could not be changed slightly without the consent of the Chinese government. Eden replied that the administration of the Settlement is based on the Land Regulations of Yangjingbang, and these regulations cannot be changed without the consent of the Chinese government. Ben also asked whether the government meant that the demands made by the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai were unacceptable. Eden replied, "That is another question. My answer is cautious and can cover this question." Ben then asked whether this meant that the Shanghai Municipal Council would not become a puppet of the Japanese army to implement its policies. Eden replied, "This is an important question. Please submit it in writing so that I can answer it." Conservative Party Knox followed up with questions: ㊀ Did the Foreign Secretary know that the Japanese army had tried its best to protect the foreigners' business and residential areas within the International Settlement in the recent battles near Shanghai? ㊁ Could the Foreign Secretary contact the Japanese government to seek safety for Chinese refugees so that they could resume their old businesses? Eden replied that it was too early to make a final judgment on the point raised in the first question. As for the second question, it is not yet known whether the British government needs to initiate this, as it is something that the authorities of the International Settlement can do. He feared that refugees would not be able to resume their old businesses in reality. Labour MP Fletcher asked whether the Foreign Secretary had received news from the Japanese government indicating that the Japanese government wanted to take over the functions exercised by the Chinese government in the International Settlement and the French Concession. Eden asked Fletcher to submit a written question for consideration and reply. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)

[London] - Foreign Secretary Eden later talked about the case of the British Ambassador to China, Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, being injured, saying that the Japanese side had not compensated for the damage. He said, "After careful consideration, the British government believed that it was more appropriate for the government to compensate itself, so it did not demand compensation from Japan." As for the rumor that the British naval commander in China, Vice Admiral Leiders, had congratulated the commander of the Japanese army in Shanghai, General Matsui, on his victory, it was not accurate. Communist MP Gallagher then questioned the looting of British houses on Hongqiao Road in Shanghai. The Foreign Secretary replied that British officials in China are doing their best to protect the property of their compatriots, and if there is any damage, they will demand compensation from the parties concerned as soon as the investigation is confirmed. "In short, regarding the dispute between China and Japan, all countries related to the Far Eastern situation are seeking the best way to reach an agreement to resolve it. The convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is based on this principle. This conference is currently in session. In addition, Britain is still maintaining close contact with the United States." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)

### United States Attitude

[Washington] - According to news here today, if the Japanese seize various administrative powers and institutions of China in Shanghai, the United States will lodge a serious protest. What is feared here is that the actions of the Japanese may endanger the treaty rights of the concessions. The State Department is now conducting close research and observation of the activities of the Japanese in the Shanghai concessions. (National Telegram on the 22nd)

### Japan Wants to Seize Customs and Post Office

Harada and Okamoto Visit Concession Authorities

[Tokyo] - Harada, the Japanese military attache in Shanghai, visited the authorities of the International Settlement on the 20th, and Consul-General Okamoto also visited the chairman, Franklin, to discuss the issue of the Japanese taking over the customs and post office. The Japanese hold the following views on this issue and believe that it is natural that they can take over the two institutions: that a few years ago, when Song Ziwen resigned as Minister of Finance, the Commissioner of Customs, Meyer, gave Song a eulogy to commemorate him. At that time, Song said in his speech that the Chinese customs had been a special existence, but today, in both form and substance, it has completely become an administrative institution of the Chinese government. Therefore, the Commissioner of Customs is also just a Chinese official. From this point of view, the international nature of the customs has been completely eliminated. Now, Japan's takeover of the customs is the same in nature as the Japanese army occupying or taking over other Chinese institutions. There should be no opposition from the international community, so it can be explained that Japan has the right to detain customs ships. Chinese customs have always been a special existence of the Chinese state, but according to a certain article of the Nine-Power Treaty regarding the fundamental principle of preserving Chinese administration, it is quite obvious that those of such nature are not allowed. As for the post office, Japan can also explain that it can implement the takeover for the same reason. The Japanese side has specially dispatched military attache Harada and Consul-General Okamoto to negotiate with the authorities of the International Settlement this time in order to solve the problem in a peaceful atmosphere.

Paris - Makita, the goodwill envoy sent by Japan to France regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, arrived here from New York at 8:15 PM tonight. Many members of the Japanese Embassy welcomed him at the station. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)

### League of Nations Medical Team Scheduled to Come to China

Departing on December 10th

[Geneva] - After the League of Nations Assembly decided a few days ago to organize three mobile medical teams with 2 million Swiss francs to go to China to assist the country in carrying out epidemic prevention work, these medical teams have been formed. The first team, led by Dr. Rasnai and Dr. Ligrele of the "Pasteur" Institute of Microbiology in Tunis, French North Africa, is scheduled to leave for China on December 10. The departure dates for the other two teams have not yet been determined. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### Poland Refuses to Participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact

Unwilling to Break Away from Britain

[London] - According to a report by the Warsaw correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, although Poland has been under strong pressure from Germany, Italy, and Japan, it has so far refused to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The correspondent also said that Poland is deeply afraid that joining the Anti-Comintern Pact will hinder Polish-British relations. Maintaining contact with Britain is an important part of Poland's foreign policy, both politically and economically. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)

### The Course of the Nine-Power Treaty

— Ang Ruo

The Nine-Power Treaty was signed and established on February 6, 1922. This document is formally called the "Treaty Relating to Principles and Policies Concerning China," commonly known as the Nine-Power Treaty. In 1921, U.S. President Harding convened the Washington Conference, and the Nine-Power Treaty came into being. At that time, the main purpose of the conference was to reduce naval forces. As a result, the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy concluded the Naval Limitation Treaty. However, several important representatives in the peace talks acknowledged that the establishment of the Nine-Power Treaty was a preliminary step for the Pacific countries to create peace. Because after the China issue was resolved, the countries fundamentally eliminated the focus of disputes. The threat of using troops was eliminated, and the Naval Limitation Treaty was established on that basis. It seemed that the overall situation in the Far East could achieve long-term stability and peace.

The Nine-Power Treaty was signed by the United States, Belgium, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, and China. At that time, it was called the "Magna Carta of China." Its essence is Article 1, which states that, except for China, the contracting countries agree:

㊀ To respect the sovereignty and independence of China, and the integrity of its territory and administration.

㊁ To provide China with the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to develop and maintain for herself an effective and stable government.

㊂ To use their good offices effectively to establish and maintain the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations throughout the territory of China.

㊃ Not to take advantage of conditions in China in order to seek special rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjects or citizens of friendly States, and from countenancing action inimical to the security of such States.

Other articles only elaborate on these general principles, such as respecting China's neutral status in wartime. If this treaty is violated, there is only one article in the treaty text that clearly explains the steps the contracting countries should take, which is Article 7, which stipulates:

The Contracting Powers agree that, whenever there shall arise any situation which in the opinion of any one of them involves the application of the stipulations of the present Treaty and renders desirable discussion of such application, there shall be full and frank communication between the Contracting Powers concerned.

Therefore, in terms of the wording of the treaty, the only active measure that the contracting countries can take is to notify each other whenever any contracting country deems it appropriate. Reexamining the minutes of the conference at that time does not add anything to this meaning. The Dutch Foreign Minister, Mr. Kanaarbeck, also raised a question at the conference: "If China's sovereignty or administrative integrity is threatened by a certain country in the future, what position should the contracting countries take?" This question was also shelved. The minutes of the drafting committee of the treaty or the speeches of representatives of various countries at the general assembly did not mention it further. However, when the US representative Mr. Luther read Article 1 of the treaty, he added that this was "announcing a rule of law to be followed by the contracting countries; it does not include the meaning of active action, nor does it allow one country to interfere in other countries, or specify what actions each country should take." The late US Secretary of State, Mr. Hughes, was the main figure of the conference and also the chief representative of the United States. He had a clearer explanation of this spirit. When the conference discussed Clauses 3 and 4 of Article 1 of the treaty regarding the open-door policy, some people advocated establishing a reference department to investigate whether this policy had been violated. Mr. Hughes declared; "This article is not coercive, and any coercive method is of no help. In the end, we can only rely on the governments of the countries that announced these principles to abide by their faith and implement them."

According to the official record, this is the spirit in which the treaty was concluded. The US Senate unanimously approved it, probably based on this spirit and understanding. When the Nine-Power Treaty was submitted to the US Senate for discussion on March 30, 1922, Senator Schapard asked: "If one of the contracting countries fails to fulfill the provisions of Article 1 of the treaty, which respects the sovereignty and independence of China, what measures should the other contracting countries take?" Senator Mr. Root (who had served as a US representative) replied: The treaty does not specify the obligation to use troops. None of the nine contracting countries can require other countries to use troops, but the treaty does stipulate a moral obligation that makes a country that violates the treaty a "lawbreaker" in front of all countries in the world. Furthermore, this country that violates the treaty and does not respect China's rights will be in an extremely serious situation for the other eight countries. I cannot imagine that this obligation will not lead to the use of troops. Anything can lead to the use of troops. However, this article does not specify the obligation to use troops."

Senator Mr. Schapard was still not satisfied with this explanation. Mr. Root continued to explain that the United States had taken a step to return Shandong to China, and other countries might take the same step. Mr. Schapard asked again. "Does Your Excellency mean that the countries will only protest?" Mr. Root replied, yes, but added: "A certain protest, with sincere and forceful wording, may have practical effect," and believed that "moral obligation also has great authority and strength." If the protest is invalid, then this matter must be submitted to Congress for discussion.

Senator Mr. Schapard then debated Clause 2 of Article 1, saying that in an emergency, moral obligations may involve the use of troops, "otherwise the treaty is worthless." Mr. Root replied, "I don't think this treaty morally involves the obligation to use troops, let alone the intention to use troops. I am not saying that one day in the future, the US government will not express its determination through the US Congress and say to a country that violates the treaty, "You must stop," and be prepared to enforce this order. But this is not expressly stipulated in the treaty."

Regarding the obligations of the United States to China stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty, the Senate accepted the definition given by Mr. Root. Senator Mr. King also expressed his opinion at that time, saying that this treaty is a "declaration of friendship - a great international expression, and nothing more." Senator Mr. Borah agreed, saying, "I think that if countries can often express this good resolution, they will eventually be able to help eliminate bad behavior."

### Our Troops Firmly Defend Jiangyin, Wuxi, and the Eastern Suburbs of Wuxing in Bloody Battles

Our Right Wing Still Holds Haiyan and Xiashi　Danyang and Changzhou Suffer Extremely Heavy Losses from Bombing

The war situation on the Eastern Front yesterday: Japanese troops actively advanced, and there were extremely fierce battles on all fronts. The information obtained from the front is recorded as follows: ㊀ Japanese troops concentrated naval, land, and air forces in the Fushan and Changshu areas, attempting to break through our army's Jiangyin and Wuxi defense lines. Dozens of Japanese aircraft bombed Jiangyin and Danyang yesterday. Sixty to seventy Japanese warships were densely deployed east of Duanshan, constantly bombarding the Duanshan and Huangshan defense areas of Jiangyin with intensive artillery fire, attempting to destroy our Jiangyin blockade line. Our fortress also frequently retaliated with heavy artillery. The Japanese troops who continued to invade west from Xitang Town in Fushan were intercepted by our army in the Changshashan, Zhouzhuang Town, and Yangjiaqiao areas, more than ten kilometers east of Jiangyin. This area is a hilly area, which is easy to defend and difficult to attack, so the Jiangyin fort is still in the hands of our army, but the situation is very critical. ㊁ Wuxi is still firmly defended by our army. In the Dongting Town and Zhoujingxiang areas in the eastern suburbs of the city, our army's interception was effective. The fighting was fierce all day, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. Our reinforcements from the capital have already arrived to participate in the battle. Wuxi and nearby villages have been bombed by large numbers of Japanese aircraft in batches for days. Although most of the civilian houses and local buildings have been destroyed, this is an important stronghold on the first line of defense, and our army will never easily give it up. We are currently working hard to resist. ㊂ After our right-wing troops abandoned Nanxun, the Japanese troops invaded west along the Hujia Highway in Dongqian, Gucun, and Jicun. In order to defend Wuxing, our army has sent a large army to intercept them. The battle is raging in the Jiuguan area (3 kilometers from Jicun) and the Shengshe area (2 kilometers from Jiuguan), 18 kilometers east of Wuxing. A certain hometown group in this city's Huzhou received a telegram from a certain important person in Zhejiang Province yesterday, proving that Huzhou is still in our hands. ㊃ The Japanese troops are fiercely attacking Xiashi, Tongxiang, and Haiyan. The fighting is very fierce, and both sides have suffered heavy casualties. Our army has deployed heavy troops on the Shimen, Chongde, and Changan lines to support them. ㊄ The Japanese troops who have penetrated along the Huhang Line are having difficulty transporting supplies due to the rainy weather and muddy roads. They are currently using a large number of aircraft to transport food from the air to the Suxi area for supply.

### Puyuan Has Become Scorched Earth, but Our Army Still Resists and Defends Bitterly

There Are Fierce Battles on Three Sides of Taihu Lake　Japan's Attempt to Land in Haiyan Was Foiled

[Hangzhou] The Japanese army bombarded our Puyuan and Tongxiang positions with fierce artillery fire and aircraft. Our army defended to the death until the position was bombed into scorched earth. More than a thousand Japanese troops rushed to the scene. Our brave soldiers drew their blades and rushed out of the trenches to meet the enemy. The Japanese army again relied on sharp artillery fire to bombard the area. The east of Puyuan has become scorched earth, and the forests have also been bombed into fields. Our army suffered heavy casualties, but still defended the scorched earth and resisted and defended bitterly. In the Haiyan and Xiashi positions, Japanese troops in civilian clothes sneaked into the inland rivers by speedboat to harass the area. The south bank of Taihu Lake is a land of fish, rice, silk, and satin. Some people who have lived there peacefully for thirty years have never heard gunfire. Now they are also joining the army in droves. The morale of the people is high. On the 22nd, Japanese aircraft dropped more than ten bombs in Linping in the afternoon. The losses are unknown. Two Japanese warships attempted to land in Haiyan in the evening but failed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd) Huadong News Agency reported that, according to news received yesterday afternoon, the situation on the Eastern Front is gradually stabilizing. On the left flank, Wuxi is gradually being firmly defended. Even if Wuxi is unfortunately moved, there is a stronger defense area that can be used to maneuver. In the Jiangyin area, the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking the fortress with naval ships for days, but our naval units are still calmly handling the situation. On the right flank, from Haiyan to the Xiashi Town in Haining County, the Japanese side has adopted a completely defensive posture on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, so there has been no frontal battle on this route so far. Huadong News Agency reported that, according to news at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, there were fierce battles on three sides of Taihu Lake. The Japanese navy, starting from Nanxun in the south to Wuxing (i.e., Huzhou), and from Wujiang into the lake in the east, attempted to cross Taihu Lake and attack Yixing. In the lake area in Changxing County, there were a very small number of Japanese troops attempting to land and harass our hinterland of Huzhou. In the northern border of Wuxi, the navy entering the lake from Wangting attempted to land 40 miles north of Shushan and attack Wuxi and Qishu. Yesterday morning, many Japanese aircraft hovered in this area.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Danyang and Changzhou

Several Japanese aircraft flew to Danyang twice at 11:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. on the 23rd to bomb the area and attempted to attack the capital. Our air defense department immediately issued an alarm, but the Japanese aircraft immediately fled after dropping several bombs in the suburbs of Danyang. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

[Zhenjiang] At 7:30 a.m. on the 22nd, two Japanese aircraft flew from Changzhou to Lingkou Railway Station in Danyang and dropped six bombs, and opened fire with machine guns to strafe the train, killing and wounding many civilians. At 9:40 a.m., more than ten Japanese aircraft flew in batches to bomb Changzhou, Danyang, Yixing, and Jintan. Dozens of bombs were dropped in Changzhou, more than ten bombs were dropped in Danyang Station, five bombs were dropped in Lingkou Station, five bombs were dropped on the Yixing Highway, and three bombs were dropped outside the West Gate of Jintan. The losses are unknown. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### Order in the Huzhou Area Remains Normal

Central News Agency reported that, after our troops in Jiaxing moved back, the war on the southern front progressed to the east of Wuxing. This city's Huzhou branch recently received a telegram from the Hangzhou office stating that the order in Huzhou (Wuxing) is normal, but most of the residents have moved away due to the war in the Jiuguan area (18 kilometers east of Wuxing). Yesterday, our army's counterattack in Jiuguan was fairly successful, and reinforcements continued to arrive. The defenses are gradually solid and can be guaranteed to be worry-free.

Hangzhou Correspondence: There is a large influx of refugees from various places to Hangzhou these days. Various public organizations are doing their best to provide relief. The Hangzhou YMCA has also opened all of its premises as refugee shelters.

### Japanese Cruiser Sails to Fushan

Central News Agency reported that the two Japanese heavy cruisers that sailed to Shanghai on the 20th sailed out of Songkou at around 6:00 a.m. yesterday and headed to the waters west of Fushan, intending to do something to our Jiangyin.

Central News Agency reported that at 10:00 a.m. today (the 23rd), a Japanese transport aircraft carrier docked at the north pier of the China Merchants Bureau, carrying twelve assembled aircraft and countless unassembled aircraft parts.

Yesterday, the 23rd, at about 8:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., six Japanese aircraft flew in two teams to reconnoiter Zhabei and Nanshi, and flew low over the wharves along the Huangpu River and empty houses, circling back and forth to observe them a dozen times. Three aircraft flew towards Yangshupu, and three aircraft flew along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road.

### More Than a Thousand Japanese Reinforcements Continue to Arrive

### Yu Youren Discusses Supervision Work Amidst National Crisis

Stating that preventing corruption is equivalent to defending against the enemy; supervision must be meticulous and effective.

[Changsha] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, arrived in Hunan yesterday. Mr. Yu recently told a reporter from the Central News Agency that when he (Yu refers to himself) passed through Jiangxi, he made a speech that roughly explained that the government's relocation to Chongqing was to adapt to strategy and to solidify the determination to resist for the long term. This would ensure that every bit of strength and every drop of blood of our nation would be dedicated to fighting for the defense of our territory and sovereignty, and to sacrificing for freedom and independence, so that the Chinese nation could become sacred and inviolable in the world. I dare to solemnly declare once again that since the government's relocation, the situation of the war of resistance has entered its largest scale. We should possess an even more tenacious and striving spirit, not only working as diligently as before, but also working ten or a hundred times harder than before to be effective. For example, in supervision work, normally it would only involve impeaching officials who violate the law or neglect their duties and auditing national budgets. At this difficult time, with military advancements at the front, a sound political rear is especially important to demonstrate the great strength of the Chinese nation in resisting the enemy and to rectify international perceptions. Preventing corruption at this time is equivalent to defending against the enemy, so we must conduct more meticulous and effective supervision. Political mobilization should not deviate from the norm, and mass mobilization should not affect social order. Based on this idea, I have sent supervisory committee members to various places to conduct open and covert investigations, provide assistance to wounded soldiers and refugees, and oversee political infrastructure and other work. This is to ensure that those who work hard are rewarded, those who make mistakes are given guidance, and those who break the law cannot escape punishment. This is the most crucial thing, and we should continue to work hard on it in the future. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the whole nation, from top to bottom, will strictly abide by national laws and wartime discipline, prepare for long-term resistance, gather individual abilities, endure short-term suffering, and strive for the freedom of the nation for thousands of years. No matter what sacrifices are required, we should not hesitate.

### Nantong Heavily Guarded

All Ports Along the River and Coast are Blockaded; Refugees from War Zones are Transported to Reclamation Areas

Nantong Correspondence: The Yangtze River surface at Langfu has been shrouded in haze for days. Japanese warships have repeatedly shelled the south bank, and using 20 to 30 small boats, under the cover of artillery, they have launched fierce attacks on Fushan Port and Changyinsha, attempting to land. We have fought back, and they have not succeeded. For days, the sound of artillery fire from the south bank has been heard intensely along the river, and fires have been seen in several places. Since the 21st, over ten Japanese transport ships have arrived, carrying many rafts, and they are making even more aggressive attempts on the Liuhai sandbar in Changshu. Due to rampant rumors on the north bank, the local military and police are on high alert, and all ports along the river and coast, large and small, are blockaded. Shipping between Nantong and Shanghai is only open at the Tianshenggang West Wharf.

Further Report: Refugees from the Jiangnan war zone have been fleeing to Nantong in increasing numbers over the past half-month, bringing the old and the young, in a very pathetic state. The young and strong have already gone to reclamation areas to start farming, and there are still 7,000 to 8,000 people who need to be transferred to the Lixiahe area.

Since the weather in Nantong suddenly turned cold on the 21st, with hail in the afternoon and especially low temperatures, various charitable organizations are raising cotton clothes from all over to help the refugees.

### World Trade Greatly Affected After the Outbreak of Sino-Japanese War

[Geneva] According to the monthly statistics released by the League of Nations, the world economic recovery has been hindered by the Sino-Japanese conflict and the fall in world prices. The volume of international trade in September and October of this year has been greatly reduced compared to normal times, with China and Japan being the most affected. For example, China's import trade was worth 25 million gold yuan in July of this year, but it decreased to 9.6 million gold yuan in August, and further decreased to 6 million gold yuan in September and October. Export trade was worth 15 million gold yuan in July, but decreased to 7.8 million gold yuan in August. Although it was 8 million gold yuan in September, it decreased to 5 million gold yuan in October. In addition, Japan's (including Korea and Taiwan) import trade was worth 60.5 million gold yuan in July, but decreased to 51 million gold yuan in August, 44 million gold yuan in September, and further decreased to 41 million gold yuan in October. However, the impact on the country's export trade was relatively minor. (Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)

### British King Convenes Privy Council Meeting to Review Report of Lord Privy Seal

Halifax Returns from Visit to Germany; Report Submitted is Extremely Confidential

[London] King George VI convened a Privy Council meeting this morning to hear the report of Lord Privy Seal Halifax after his visit to Berlin. (Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)

[London] Well-informed sources recently stated that, regarding the continued talks between Britain and Germany, German leader Hitler proposed to British Lord Privy Seal Halifax the condition of recognizing Germany's equal rights on the colonial issue, so that Germany could restore its old colonies within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the report submitted by Lord Halifax after his talks with the German authorities this time is extremely confidential and is only distributed to ministers of the cabinet departments. Even the confidential secretaries of the departments have not been able to read it, which is quite noteworthy. (Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)

[London] Lord Privy Seal Halifax returned here from Berlin at 3:42 PM today and immediately had a long talk with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden, reporting on his meeting with German leader Hitler. According to what is generally known, Hitler presented Lord Halifax with a list of questions verbally, asking Britain to clarify its attitude, namely: (1) Britain should acknowledge that Germany was not the initiator of the European war; (2) Britain should acknowledge that Germany has the right to restore its former colonies without any compensation; (3) Britain should acknowledge that Germany has the right to independently resolve the issue of German minorities in various countries. It is said that Lord Halifax neither gave an answer at the time nor expressed any opinion, saying that he would forward it to his government. After the long talks between the Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, and Lord Halifax today, the report submitted by the Lord has been sent to experts in the Foreign Office for study, and they will continue to discuss it tomorrow so that opinions can be presented at the cabinet meeting on the 24th. The public attaches great importance to the cabinet meeting on this day, believing that at that time, a decision should be made on whether to continue talks between Britain and Germany and whether to answer the list of questions prepared by Lord Halifax. It is expected that the cabinet meeting will address certain issues, or present affirmative answers. Regarding the issue of the merger between Germany and Austria, Germany may advocate holding a plebiscite in Austria to make a decision. This is a matter on which the opinions of British cabinet members are very divided, and it will inevitably cause great difficulties. (Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)

### Feetham's Expression After the Japanese Make Demands on the Shanghai Concessions

Hoping that Chinese and the Municipal Council Will Cooperate to Gradually Settle the Chaotic Situation

The Shanghai Times reported that Feetham, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told a representative of the Shanghai Times yesterday afternoon (22nd) that the Council was not surprised by the attitude expressed by the Japanese authorities on Saturday regarding the actions of certain groups and individuals in the Public Concession and the French Concession. The Council has discussed some of the matters and feels that some changes will have to be made soon. However, in order to promptly remove the many difficulties at present, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive plan and obtain the cooperation and support of the Chinese in the concession. The city is now in an extremely unusual position, surrounded by troops on all sides and actually occupied by Japanese troops. People from all walks of life must recognize this situation. However, no friction has occurred with the Japanese authorities so far. The Council deeply believes that if Chinese with proper thinking can provide full cooperation, no friction will occur. Those who are prepared to engage in their normal business within the limits of the current situation need not be alarmed. If residents in the concession, especially the Chinese, can provide support in this regard, Shanghai can easily return to normal as soon as possible. Feetham also mentioned the discussion with the Japanese authorities on Saturday, saying that the time for discussion was limited and there was not enough time to study certain aspects of the current situation in detail. However, the Council has considered the points mentioned by the Japanese authorities, and some have already been implemented. The Council authorities had already been engaged in suppressing radical anti-Japanese groups before the outbreak of the war. This work is still in progress. However, since the situation in this port changed and the Japanese army won, most, if not all, of these groups have automatically ceased their activities. Regarding the closure of the Kuomintang branch in this port, most of the personnel of the branch have now stopped working. Feetham went on to describe the attitude of the Chinese under the current situation, saying that he had discussed the future with many influential Chinese in society. They all have vision and are prepared to endure grievances in order to avoid causing disputes. Many Chinese agree that the only solution to the current problem is to cooperate with the Municipal Council so that the chaotic situation can be gradually settled. Feetham concluded by saying that the Council is well aware of the difficulties north of Suzhou Creek but believes that the Japanese authorities are also eager to open up the areas north of the creek as soon as possible so that former residents can return.

The English-language "China Press" reported that Feetham, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated today (22nd) that the Council does not regard the five requests put forward by the Japanese to suppress anti-Japanese activities and eliminate the influence of the Chinese government in the Shanghai area as unreasonable. The Council authorities had already implemented most of them before the Japanese made them. There is no need to issue special orders to the Public Concession Police Force to satisfy the wishes of the Japanese. Two of the requests involve prohibiting the censorship of newspapers, news, and telegrams by the Chinese government. This censorship office has already ceased operations on its own. Another request stated that the organs and representatives of the Chinese government should be removed. This has nothing to do with the Public Concession because, with the exception of postal and telecommunications, they are all located in the French Concession. The Japanese have not interfered with the postal and telecommunications bureaus and do not intend to set up censorship offices. Feetham also said that the Council has not ordered any Chinese to leave the Concession within a time limit, and the Japanese authorities have not submitted a list of Chinese they want to expel from Shanghai. Feetham also denied the statement that the Japanese authorities had said that the Council had handed over some Chinese to the Japanese, so there was no question of refusing the request. The Council is now conducting everything with the Japanese authorities in a very harmonious manner. Feetham concluded by saying that the French Concession authorities will bear the main responsibility for implementing the Japanese requests. The French Concession authorities are still holding important meetings this morning and have not yet agreed on a solution. However, according to reliable sources, the French authorities have not asked any Chinese to leave the country. The Japanese have not set a deadline for the French authorities to implement their requests. The French authorities are still debating the best way to comply with the Japanese requests. The question of whether those who are asked to leave the country will be given safe conduct has not yet been raised, but it is expected that the Japanese will not interfere with them. Feetham commented on the Japanese request to expel certain Chinese from the Concession, saying that the Council has no right to order Chinese to leave the Concession, but can only ask them to leave. If they do not comply, they will no longer be protected by the Concession Police Force.

It is reported that the French police have searched several private Chinese radio stations in the French Concession and ordered them to shut down, but the details are not yet known.

### Britain and the United States are Unaware of Japan's Shipbuilding Plans

All That is Known is that Naval Expenditures are Very Large, and Defensive Works are Being Built in Taiwan

[London] Regarding the launching of Japan's new cruisers, the naval expert of the Daily Telegraph, Pevalat, commented that the British and American naval departments are unaware of the extent of Japanese shipbuilding in 1926. All that is known is that Japan is currently spending £55 million to build new ships, £5 million to operate naval bases, and £4.25 million for naval expenditures outside of the regular budget. As for the tonnage and caliber of the new ships, it is mysteriously unknown. If it exceeds the limits of the 1936 London Treaty, the United States will definitely cancel the treaty. Japan is also building large-scale defensive works in Taiwan. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 23rd)

### Wang Jingwei's Talk in Hankou

[Hankou] Chairman Wang arrived in Hankou at 11:00 AM on the 23rd aboard the Zhongshan warship, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming. A Central News Agency reporter called on Chairman Wang in the afternoon to ask for his views on the current situation. The Chairman first said that the main significance of the National Government's relocation to Chongqing is twofold: first, to be free from enemy threats, and second, to be able to mobilize the broadest anti-Japanese forces of the entire nation. This move is by no means abandoning the capital. We are determined to make the greatest effort and the most sustained struggle to defend the capital. We will also resolutely and strongly resist along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Nanjing-Shanghai lines, and inflict heavy blows on the enemy. Now, Chairman Lin has already started his journey to Chongqing. According to the provisions of the Party's constitution, the Central Party Headquarters must be located where the National Government is located, so the Central Party Headquarters will also be relocated to Chongqing. Other central organs may establish offices in appropriate locations due to factual necessity. The Chairman then made a statement on the diplomatic front, saying that we have always trusted international peace organizations. We believe that the various efforts of the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will ultimately benefit the Far East and world peace. Since the launch of our full-scale war of resistance, the international community has shown deep sympathy. Although the Nine-Power Conference has not yet achieved concrete results, we believe that they will not disappoint us on the point of assisting China. The issue of sanctions against aggressor countries may also be implemented sooner or later. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)

### Japanese Warships Actively Spy on Our Hainan

Japanese Warships Continue to Increase in Tangjiawan, Zhongshan County; Plotting to Covet Macau and Build an Airfield on Land

Guangzhou Correspondence: Japanese warships have been successively transferred south recently, and at the same time, armed fishing boats are being used to spy on the ports of Fujian and Guangdong. Several Japanese cruisers were found in Guangao Township and Yuanhao in Chaoyang County on the east coast of Guangdong Province. On the 11th, three more Japanese warships arrived in Tangjiawan, Zhongshan County. On the same day, in Humen, the Da Xing, a steamer traveling from Hong Kong to Wuzhou, was intercepted and searched by a Japanese warship on the sea off Dachan Island for about an hour before the ship entered Humen and went directly to Xijiang to Wuzhou. On the 13th, two warships from the Japanese 16th Fleet came to the sea off Dachan Island. On the 14th, they sailed to Hebao Island, one being a cruiser anchored in the port, and the other being a destroyer, moored in the northeast corner, using it as cover, to plot to spy on Qiongya. It is heard that the number of Japanese warships has increased to eight or nine. On the 15th, it was reported that the Japanese warships once shelled the coast, and our defense forces calmly fought back. The Japanese warships attempted to land but failed. There are usually many fishing boats going to sea between Qiongya and the Leizhou Peninsula, but recently, when the warships arrived, the fishing boats dared not go to sea. Japanese warships use searchlights to illuminate the shore at night to spy on our situation. The defending troops of Leiqiong are now on high alert. The Qiongya Defense Headquarters has also expanded its organization and established air defense branches in various counties of Qiongya to assist in handling air defense matters in each county. It was recently rumored that a Japanese aircraft carrier had sailed to Qiongya, but it has been verified that this is not the case. The Japanese aircraft that flew over Qiongya to spy were all seaplanes from Japanese warships docked in Qionghai. Each Japanese warship has about two or one seaplanes. Recently, Japan has installed no less than two or three hundred armed fishing boats in Taiwan, which have been sailing to the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong. A few days ago, a Japanese fishing boat was found near a port in Qiongya, transporting grain and fuel oil to supply the Japanese warships. Unexpectedly, it was blown by the wind to a sandy beach and ran aground. Japanese soldiers drowned, and hundreds of cans of fuel oil (aircraft fuel) stored on the armed fishing boat were seized by our residents.

No less than ten Japanese warships, large and small, have arrived recently in Tangjiawan, Zhongshan County. It is also heard that the Japanese are consulting with the Portuguese government in Macau, intending to use Macau as a supply base for Japanese warships, requesting the Macau government to allow them to purchase grain and fuel oil in Macau, and forcibly requesting the Portuguese government to designate a certain section of Macau as a Japanese land airfield. The Macau government has not yet made a statement. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese are steadily proceeding with their plot to conquer Guangdong and Guangxi. (November 16th)

Those who have just arrived in Germany are surprised by the fact that German women do not pay attention to dressing up and do not have the habit of applying rouge and powder. Especially the women seen on the streets mostly have a masculine air, which is considered an incomprehensible thing. Why are German women the only exception? It sounds like a miracle that a woman does not love to dress up!

In fact, in this kind of place, German women also have their own difficulties. The general "public opinion" of German men – at least on the surface – not only supports "healthy beauty" but even further advocates "natural beauty." An ordinary girl with heavy makeup and flamboyant clothes is not easy to gain the sympathy of most young men. When she walks on the street, someone always deliberately criticizes her loudly behind her back: "Look, there's a French woman here!" Would she dare to try again a second time? The standard of beauty in the eyes of German men is a female athlete. However, many German youths secretly envy the women of England and France. German men who have been to Paris and London always tell everyone that women in England and France are really good-looking.

Since the Nazi Party came to power, German girls have been incorporated into the Hitler Youth League for girls. They put on military-like brown uniforms. They have to drill several times a week. When they march in the streets in formation, their steps are neat, almost more impressive than the British army. Once, after a team of Hitler Youth girls passed by, a young German man told reporters that he thought it would be better for him not to marry. A year ago, we could almost see traces of these "military uniform" female members everywhere. Since last year, the situation has suddenly changed. Many girls love to wear their usual clothes. According to a British newspaper, this is purely the result of the passive resistance of German men.

In recent years, sports have become very popular among the European people. In winter, they go to the mountains to ski, and in summer, they go to the seaside to swim. As long as they have the economic ability and time, who would want to miss this opportunity! This group of people spends two or three weeks in the mountains or at the seaside, tanned all over. When they come back, the degree of blackness on their skin is not as good as that of real black people, but it is more than that of Indians. This kind of dark skin has gradually become fashionable. On the one hand, it can show that he or she has traveled, and on the other hand, it has become a symbol of health. Many women even regard their "black faces" as decorations and walk proudly on the streets. Once this trend started, it aroused the admiration of women in other cities. However, most women do not have the money or time to go to the mountains or the seaside. So they thought of another method: either sunbathing on the roof or in the park, or using sun lamps to tan their faces. This is especially true for German women who love sports, who believe that this is their only decoration. As a result, in German cities, black-skinned women can be seen almost everywhere. This has caused concern among the Nazi authorities.

The Nazi Party's racial theory is to vigorously promote the pure Aryan race. They claim that "the characteristics of the northern Aryan race are white skin and blond hair. As for blond hair, the Germans are not as good as the people of Sweden and Norway, although they have white skin, which is an unquestionable fact. In recent years, German women do not want to preserve this white skin, isn't it simply deliberately joking with the Nazi Party's racial theory! Precisely for this reason, the Nazi Party headquarters recently issued an order, denouncing these women who do not know how to cherish their race, saying that they regard the "inferior" black skin as fashionable, which is a disgrace to the Aryan Germans. In this order, the German people are further advised to rise up against this group of black-skinned German women. It turns out that the people of the "Third Reich" must not only preserve the essence of the "Northern" race, but also should not embarrass the "Northern" race in appearance. In addition, it is announced that this movement to eliminate "black skin" will be started by the Hitler Youth from today.

It is indeed not easy to be a German woman!

A month ago, I visited a politician in London. He was a very generous person. He answered the several questions raised by the reporter in detail. Because he is also an expert, this material is particularly valuable. But when he supervised, he repeatedly told the reporter that this conversation must not be published. He said: "You should know this kind of thing. But it is not appropriate to publish it." So we had to give it up.

I remember when I was in Germany two years ago, I visited the Zeppelin airship factory. At that time, the Hindenburg, which had been in distress a few months ago, was being manufactured. Before the visit, the reporter collected a lot of materials from the German newspapers, ready to write a newsletter. According to the German newspapers, the manufacture of this airship was particularly difficult. The reason is that in terms of technology, every nail and every line must be carefully arranged, and no errors are allowed. Therefore, no one dares to predict when the entire project will be completed. Maybe it will take half a year or a year...

During the visit, I happened to meet an acquaintance, who was also one of the engineers of the factory. He led the visit, and the reporter asked him to explain this question. At the same time, I first told him that the German newspapers said that it was solely due to technical difficulties that it would take more time. We news reporters would not believe this. Because Germany has always had rich experience in manufacturing airships!

So he told the truth. According to him, during the European War, Germany's ability to manufacture airships was to complete a pair of Zeppelin airships every month. According to the current technical equipment, it is not difficult to build an airship every half month. The reason for the repeated postponements is still economic reasons. He said in a low voice: Think about it, at least hundreds of people come here to visit every day. We have thousands of marks of income from tickets alone every week. In addition, the prosperity of pubs and hotels in this place also depends on our pair of airships. In terms of technology, we can rush it out within a few days. But what good is this to us? After our airship is completed, all the tourists will immediately disperse. ...What's more, we already have the Zeppelin airship in operation...

Before leaving, he instructed the reporter: Never mention what he just said. The reporter's answer was: "Of course, how can I tell the readers that the Zeppelin airship factory is extending the manufacturing time solely for the sake of tourist tickets? As for whether I will say, like other newspapers, that it is purely a technical issue, I have to consider it."

As a result of the consideration, I sacrificed that newsletter.

Readers Should Be Careful Themselves

I remember last year, several acquaintances wrote letters, hoping that the reporter would write more about the inside story of European politics. They felt that reading the international news in domestic newspapers almost gave them the feeling of becoming more and more blurred. The reporter personally sympathizes with this very much. Before domestic newspapers send correspondents abroad, or the Central News Agency expands into an international news agency, this phenomenon will always be difficult to improve.

The sources of international news in domestic newspapers are all provided by major news agencies in various countries. The French Havas News Agency not only provides us with French news, but also includes the telegrams of various countries on that day. The British Reuters News Agency, the Japanese Domei News Agency, the German Huitong News Agency, the Soviet Russian TASS News Agency, the American United Press, etc., are all like this. Therefore, whenever an incident occurs, the news agencies of various countries report the so-called "truth" of this incident to us from their own positions and from the perspective of their own countries. The France in the eyes of German reporters is the same as the Germany in the eyes of French reporters. Although everyone writes that it cannot be too far from the facts, it is still somewhat discounted in the eyes of us Chinese. As a result, it is reflected in Chinese newspapers, and it becomes a contradictory phenomenon. Everyone says their own reasons for every piece of news. The only ones who suffer are our readers!

Perhaps some people feel that they usually cannot find traces of propaganda in the telegrams of news agencies in various countries. In fact, this is the art of propaganda. Those who publicize to the point of letting others see it are only qualified to be official propagandists. The news agencies of various countries are all semi-official. The difficulty they feel lies in the fact that they must pretend that their position is detached when issuing manuscripts, at least to make readers believe that they are not propagandizing. When it comes to a critical moment, they downplay it as if everything is a fact, making it impossible for ordinary readers to distinguish. This is the wonderful technique of propaganda.

At present, the biggest weakness of domestic newspapers is probably the inability to be independent in international news. Turning this precious space into a battlefield for the news wars of news agencies in various countries, we can only feel ashamed, because we spent money to buy other people's propaganda materials. Here, in addition to advising readers to be careful when reading newspapers, on the other hand, I hope that the editors of the international news columns of various newspapers will sort out the telegrams of various agencies on that day. At least, it should be mentioned that the view of a certain country's news agency is like this, and the view of a certain country's news agency is like that, so that readers can judge for themselves.

The only thing we can do for the time being is probably this.

### The First Batch of Foreign Rice Has Begun to Be Unloaded Yesterday

Twelve Companies Including Wanchang Resumed Retail Sales Yesterday; The Rice Dealers Association Will Continue to Register the Second Batch Upon Arrival; The Price of Standard Flour Has Risen to Four Yuan, Two Jiao, and a Half Per Bag

The Public Concession Bureau and the South China Rice Industry Company are cooperating to explore the transportation of foreign rice to Shanghai to regulate people's food. The first batch of 25,000 bags has been loaded on the Jiaying Wheel and transported to Shanghai. After being certified by the consulates general of the United Kingdom and France in Shanghai, it was ordered by Daifu Foreign Company. The unloading began at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. The Rice Dealers Association received it and distributed it to 500 member rice companies. Twelve companies including Wanchang in the French Concession resumed business for retail sales yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:

The Obstruction Process

After the British Taikoo Company Jiaying Wheel arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 21st, the cargo owner Daifu Foreign Company sent personnel to handle the unloading the day before yesterday. The Rice Dealers Association sent personnel to handle the collection of rice, so as to distribute it to the member rice companies in the two concessions for retail sales. Temporarily, the Japanese authorities sent personnel to investigate, resulting in the failure of unloading. Daifu Foreign Company submitted supporting documents, such as purchase orders, and reported to the French Consul General in Shanghai to request negotiations and expedite the release. At the same time, the British boss of the company reported to the British Consul General in Shanghai.

Certification and Release

After receiving the request from Daifu Foreign Company, the British and French consulates in Shanghai immediately notified the Japanese authorities that the rice loaded on the Jiaying Wheel was indeed the goods ordered by Daifu Foreign Company. They requested expedited release. After the Japanese authorities investigated and found that it was true, they agreed to release it. Yesterday morning, after Daifu Foreign Company received the notice of release from the British and French consulates in Shanghai, it immediately informed the South China Rice Industry Company to order the Rice Dealers Association to send personnel to collect it.

Start Unloading

Daifu Foreign Company sent staff to the Bund Pier on Erma Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to handle the unloading matters, and the British authorities sent a platoon of soldiers to protect the pier. Huang Ruyuan, Su Boxun, and others were sent by the Rice Dealers Association to handle the rice collection, and 40 trucks were prepared to carry the rice flag to transport the foreign rice. The Public Concession and French Concession police sent Chinese police to accompany the trucks to protect the Jiaying Wheel. The unloading began at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. Two barges were used from the pontoon in front of the Taikoo Pier to transport the rice to the Bund on Erma Road for loading on trucks. Each truck loaded 80 bags, which were distributed to various rice companies by the Rice Dealers Association.

Handle Retail Sales

By 5:10 p.m. yesterday, the Jiaying Wheel had unloaded a total of 1,000 bags of foreign rice. It was decided to continue unloading this morning. From 3:00 p.m. yesterday, twelve companies in the French Concession, including Baohe, Sentaihe, Wanchang, Yuanyuan, Sanyang, Tairunxing, Xindashen, Xinda, Xinshenghe, Wanxingshun, and Zhonghua, resumed business first for retail sales. The remaining rice companies and 300 rice companies in the Public Concession will resume business and handle retail sales after receiving the foreign rice. The method is to limit each person to purchase one yuan, at 8.5 cents per market catty.

Continue to Apply

The second and third batches of 55,000 bags of foreign rice have been loaded on British ships and are expected to arrive in Shanghai before the end of this month. The Rice Dealers Association has decided to continue to register member rice companies for rice collection after the first batch of foreign rice is distributed. The application form for rice collection by members is as follows:

"This company is willing to abide by all the temporary measures set by your association, collect rice for retail sales, and please review and register to allow distribution. Sincerely, Shanghai Rice Dealers Association."

After the association reviews and approves, pay the money to receive the bill of lading and collect the rice for retail sales.

New Rice Companies

Thirty-two new rice companies have been established in the Public Concession of this city recently, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now reported that twelve companies, including Shende, Hongjigong, Yongfu, Yuchengxiang, Yichangheji, Yongsheng, Chengtai, Yifeng, Jiuda, New Shanghai, and Senshunyuanji, are preparing to open.

Sufficient Flour Stock

The New Sound News Agency learned from the flour industry yesterday that Shanghai had about 80,000 bags of wheat in stock last month, all piled up in various warehouses. The flour stock was about 300,000 bags. Flour factories such as Fuxin and Fufeng were rushing to produce flour. The rice market is now in excess of supply, so flour sales are very smooth. The wholesale price of standard flour, such as Fufeng's Car Brand and Fuxin's Ship Brand, has risen to 4 yuan and 2.5 jiao per bag yesterday. The prices of the No. 3 and No. 4 flour brands have also risen accordingly.

### Anhui Province Announces Rules for Managing Grain

Notice for Going to Wuhu to Purchase Rice

Rice merchants in this city are taking various measures to purchase grain from Wuhu, Anhui, and Wenzhou and Taizhou in eastern Zhejiang in order to supply people's food. However, eastern Zhejiang is originally a rice-deficient area and cannot supply a steady stream of grain. Anhui is a rice-producing province. Although the transportation of Jianglun is not without considerable danger, it is still passable. It is reported that the Anhui Provincial Government has now announced the Anhui Province Grain Entry and Exit Registration Rules in order to manage grain in extraordinary times. The full text is as follows: Article 1. The registration of grain entering and exiting Anhui Province shall be handled by the Anhui Province Grain Management Committee in accordance with the locations designated by the Provincial Government, and shall be entrusted to the Rice and Wheat Inspection Institute or the local county government to establish grain entry and exit registration offices separately. Article 2. Anyone who transports the following items of grain into and out of the province shall apply for registration in accordance with these rules: 1. Rice, 2. Wheat flour, 3. Beans, 4. Miscellaneous grains. For the items listed in the preceding paragraph, each county may increase or decrease the items as appropriate according to the actual situation, but it must be reported to the Grain Management Committee for record. Article 3. Anyone who transports grain into and out of the province shall apply for registration to the registration office at the port of entry or departure, and obtain a grain entry and exit registration certificate. When arriving at the port of exit or unloading location, report to the local registration office to verify that the goods and certificates are consistent before being released or unloaded. Article 4. Anyone who transports grain out of the province shall, when applying for an exit registration certificate, seek a local reliable shop to guarantee that it is indeed to supply military food or civilian food, and obtain a certificate from the local administrative agency or chamber of commerce at the destination and send it to the original registration office for verification. If it is found that there is any enemy-supporting situation, after investigation and confirmation, all the original grain transporters, guarantors, and certifiers shall be punished in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Crimes of Supporting the Enemy with Food and Grain promulgated by the Executive Yuan. Article 5. The grain entry and exit registration certificate shall state: ① The name and address of the merchant and the name and address of its representative, ② The source, type, quantity, price, and use of the grain, ③ The name and address of the purchasing merchant or agency, ④ The transportation route and destination. The grain entry and exit registration certificate form in the preceding paragraph shall be determined separately. Article 6. No fees shall be charged for the issuance of grain entry and exit registration certificates. Article 7. Each registration office shall handle registration procedures and issue certificates in the order of application, and shall handle them in the most expeditious manner. If the staff delays, extorts, or colludes to engage in fraud, and the investigation confirms that it is true, they shall be severely punished according to law. Article 8. These rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Nanhua Grain Panic Has Been Resolved

Guangdong Grain Merchants Request Foreign Ships to Transport Goods; Jardine Matheson Has Sent Ships for Trial Navigation

Since the blockade of Humen, Guangzhou, navigation has been suspended for more than a month. Although it was later opened under restrictions, the shallow water and narrow roads made it difficult for various ships to navigate, and ships with heavier loads and deeper drafts, such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, were still unable to enter. Recently, Shanghai has been affected by the war, and cargo transportation in various places has been blocked. Previously, bulk shipments of various grains such as raw peanuts, sesame, and beans from Shanghai to Guangzhou have all been cut off, resulting in a shortage of grains in Guangzhou and soaring prices. It is reported that Guangdong grain merchants have now requested foreign shipping companies such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson to increase the number of Guangzhou-Shanghai-North China liners to transport beans, sesame, raw peanuts, and other goods from Tianjin and Qingdao to Guangdong to regulate market prices and supply demand. At the same time, the grain merchants submitted a request to the Guangdong Pacification Commissioner's Office to open a partial blockade of Humen with reference to the example of the Hong Kong-Guangdong route, so as to facilitate the navigation of Guangdong-Shanghai-Tianjin liners and transport North China grain to Guangdong to make up for the cut-off of goods from Shanghai. The Guangdong Pacification Commissioner's Office has approved it accordingly. Jardine Matheson first sent the Liniu Wheel to test the Humen blockade line. The test result was that each ship could generally carry 500 tons of cargo and sail to Lizhou, 30 miles away from Guangdong Province. It could not sail further, so barges were stationed in Lizhou to be used for transshipping goods into the province. The first ship has been scheduled to be the Sheng Wheel and will sail first to Hong Kong, then to Shanghai, and then to Tianjin to carry grain to Guangdong. It is said that Jardine Matheson has scheduled the Guangsheng, Zesheng, Desheng, Hengsheng, and Lisheng Wheels to operate on this route. Taikoo has also sent six ships to travel between Guangdong, Shanghai, and Tianjin. From then on, the grain panic in Nanhua has been resolved. The loss of Shanghai and the cut-off of transportation are no longer a problem in practice.

### The Public Concession Health Department is Soliciting Blood

For Children Suffering from Measles; Injecting Preventative Serum

Measles is now prevalent in this city, and residents must pay attention. There is no specific method to treat this disease, so the mortality rate of patients in this city, especially refugees, is quite high. However, anyone who injects serum made from human blood within the first few days after contracting this disease can prevent its onset or reduce the severity of the disease. Therefore, injecting serum is the only method available to the Public Concession Health Department to curb the spread of this disease. Its effectiveness has been proven by the medical community in various countries. Many enthusiastic citizens have volunteered to supply blood to the Public Concession Health Department, but the quantity is limited and still insufficient. The department has established offices at the Pasteur Medical Research Laboratory at No. 102, No. 29 Hankou Road (at the intersection of Henan Road), and the Public Concession Patrol Hospital at No. 445 Shanhai Pass Road to collect blood. Office hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Any healthy adult can donate 200 to 300 cc of blood without any adverse effects on their constitution. 200 to 300 cc of blood is enough to save the lives of ten children. Blood from those who have recently recovered from measles is especially effective. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will be willing to respond enthusiastically.

### Negotiations on Customs Patrol Boats Have Not Yet Yielded Results

After all the customs anti-smuggling patrol boats of the Jianghai Customs were towed away by the Japanese army, Tax Commissioner Robert Ford made a request for negotiations, but there have been no results to date. Except for a portion of the towed boats near the No. 2 pontoon pier in Yangshupu, the rest have been sailed to the upper and lower reaches of the Huangpu River for military transportation. However, the Puji Wheel is the only fire boat in the Huangpu River and is very important for navigation safety. The Japanese side is afraid of causing an international backlash, so it has indicated that it can continue to be used for firefighting, but a separate department needs to be set up within the Concession Fire Brigade to manage the boat. Currently, the boat has also been towed away and is said to be near the Izumo warship.

### The International Friendship Society Regularly Entertains Celebrities

Entertaining Yan Huiqing, Father Zhao, and Dozens of Other Chinese and Foreign Celebrities

The Shanghai International Friendship Society, organized by Xu Xinliu, Chen Guangfu, Bei Songsun, Li Fuxun, Zou Bingwen, and others, is scheduled to host a banquet for Chinese and foreign celebrities in this city at the International Hotel at 12:30 p.m. on December 1. Invitation cards have been issued by the honorary secretary of the society, Zhu Shaoping. The invitees include Dr. Yan Huiqing, the former Chinese ambassador to Russia, as well as Father Zhao, McLaden, Jesspie, Andrew, Bub, Byron, and Potter. It is said that Yan Fuqing, a veteran member of the society who has been working on the Red Cross, will also attend and give a brief speech. The chairman will be Liu Zhanen, the president of Hujiang University.

### Another Fire Broke Out in Nanshi Yesterday

According to Dagong News Agency, at 2:40 p.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the area near the Small World in Nanshi and spread. For a time, smoke filled the sky and sparks shot in all directions. By the evening, it was still spreading.

### Local Gangsters in Pudong Search and Rob Travelers of Money and Belongings

Although there are puppet police posts in the Laiyi Ferry area of Pudong, the ferry crossings along the Pu River from Qichang Wharf to Tangqiao are still guarded by 31 Japanese soldiers. On the pretext that the martial law has not been lifted, residents returning to Puxi are not allowed to land at the above-mentioned ferry crossings. To the east of Qichang Wharf, there are Jiajiajiao and Gaoqiao, where ferries are operated by righteous merchants to maintain transportation, so civilians can enter and exit. Currently, some people are concerned about their homes and are venturing across the river to visit. When they land, no one stops them and they walk leisurely. When they return, they are intercepted by gangsters midway and searched. If they have money on them, it is all robbed. If they beg them, they only return two or three cents to pay for the ferry fare. If they are carrying clothes or belongings, they are also stopped and confiscated.

### Please Issue Special Passports for Transporting Goods Through the Martial Law Zone

The Ministry of Industry telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has read the previous telegram from Jiuyuehao, requesting that unified methods for applying for cargo transportation passes be reviewed and finalized. The Ministry has sent a letter to the Fourth Department of the Military Affairs Commission to investigate and handle the matter, and has approved and notified all cases. The Fourth Department has replied that in order to facilitate the circulation of goods to meet the needs of various places, the Ministry has specially drafted special cargo transportation passports of the Military Affairs Commission, and the issuance methods and passport formats have been submitted to the Chairman for approval and implementation. In the future, when merchants in various places need to transport goods through the martial law zone, they can apply to the Ministry for approval and issuance of passports in accordance with the above methods. The corresponding methods and passport formats are copied and sent together for reference and notification to the subordinate agencies. The seal of the Ministry of Industry.

### The Huishan Telephone Branch Resumes Operations Today

Telephone Service in the Eastern District of Shanghai is Now Uninterrupted

After the August 13th Incident, the Hongkou area of the Shanghai International Settlement was immediately occupied by the Japanese army as a base of operations. Consequently, all institutions, factories, and shops in the area were shut down, and even the police officers were evacuated. The Shanghai Telephone Company's Huishan Road branch was also temporarily closed. Telephone users in the East Broadway Road and Yangshupu areas were temporarily rerouted through the Central Main Branch, and the first digit of their telephone numbers was changed to '1'. Now that the war has moved beyond Shanghai and the local situation is gradually calming down, parts of the Shanghai districts are gradually recovering, and police officers have returned to their original posts. Therefore, the company's Huishan Road branch will resume operations today. All telephone numbers in the area will revert to their original prefix of '5' and be routed through that branch. As a result, telephone service has been uninterrupted in recent days.

### All Party and Government Agencies in Shanghai are Temporarily Closed

Most of the Staff Have Left Shanghai

Since our army abandoned Shanghai due to strategic considerations, the entire city fell. The original Party and government agencies in Shanghai, such as the municipal government and its various bureaus, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Martial Law Command, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the various district branches, were ordered to close down due to the circumstances. Most of the staff of these agencies have also left Shanghai for Nanjing or Wuhan to work.

### The Cotton Yarn Brokers Association Subscribes to National Salvation Bonds

According to Xin Shengzu, the brokers association of the Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange is leading its members to enthusiastically subscribe to national bonds. The first subscription totaled 52,090 yuan, the second 24,380 yuan, the third 17,940 yuan, the fourth 17,360 yuan, and the fifth 6,400 yuan. Yesterday, they also reported and paid 13,344 yuan for the sixth subscription to the First Special District. The total sum of national currency is 134,010 yuan.

### Villagers in Western Shanghai Should Not Risk Returning Home

Since the change in the war situation and the westward movement of the battle lines, most of the residents of western Shanghai have fled to Shanghai in a panic. As time has passed and winter is approaching, villagers need warm clothing. Therefore, some have been risking returning home to search for supplies. However, passage is impossible during the day, and they dare only travel via roundabout routes late at night. Night travel is very dangerous. Therefore, it is hoped that villagers in western Shanghai will not travel there again.

### Puci Sanatorium Establishes a Refugee Camp

Refugees Desperately Need Clothing and Bedding - Deeply Hope for Donations from All Sectors

The Puci Sanatorium, located at Tongqiao Station on the Shanghai-Minhang Road in the county, is a mental hospital founded by missionaries from the United States, Britain, and France. Since the changes in the Shanghai war and the retreat of our army, refugees from Songjiang and other places have gathered in the Beiqiao area, numbering about four to five thousand, in a difficult situation. Fortunately, the foreign personnel in charge of the sanatorium have been enthusiastically helping, and have extensively accommodated them in the sanatorium. However, due to the inconvenient transportation and lack of prior preparation, and the large number of people, providing supplies is very difficult. Now that winter is approaching, the refugees desperately need clothing and bedding. It is deeply hoped that all charitable sectors will generously donate.

### The Children's Welfare Association Expands its Accommodation of Women and Children

Children's Clinic Established in the Refugee Area

Since the China Children's Welfare Association established an office in the Nanshi refugee area, specializing in accommodating homeless children in the area, the association has been doing its best to accommodate all homeless children. However, there are still some children in the area whose parents cannot bear to leave them, but cannot support them on their own. The association plans to expand its accommodation of women and children to achieve both goals. It is also heard that the association is paying close attention to children's diseases and plans to establish a children's clinic in the area to treat them. However, the lack of cotton clothing for the children is a major cause of illness. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will donate generously to provide relief.

### The Buddhist Hospital Seeks Donations of Cotton Clothing

The Buddhist Hospital at 764 Niuzhuang Road has treated more than 500 wounded since its founding. Although those who have recovered have been successively transferred to the interior, there are still more than 240 patients in the hospital. As the weather is getting colder, there is a great shortage of cotton quilts, cotton-padded jackets, trousers, and underwear. It is earnestly hoped that kind benefactors from all walks of life will generously donate to help them keep warm. Furthermore, donations of daily necessities such as medicine, milk, toothbrushes, and stoves are also welcomed from all sectors.

### The Post Office Temporarily Suspends Sending Small Parcels to Jiangsu and Zhejiang

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1435 states that the resumption of accepting small parcels to Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong provinces was previously announced in Notice No. 1415. Due to transportation difficulties, the acceptance of small parcels to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is temporarily suspended from today. This is hereby announced so that all are aware. Director Zhapailin, November 12th.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Public Works Report for October

Reviewing Building Plans, Conducting Sanitary Work

According to the report of the Director of Public Works of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in October of this year, public works in the northeast districts of the Settlement were largely suspended due to the war. Ditch works in the Western District were continued, but were suspended again at the end of the month as the battlefield shifted to western Shanghai. Regular work in the districts not affected by the war, such as collecting road garbage, removing silt from drains, and washing roads, was carried out as usual. A total of 153 buildings were under construction within the Settlement. A total of 34 construction plans were submitted for review, and 16 were approved. A total of 16 batches of buildings were valued and prepared for donation collection.

### The Police Force Trapped in the Settlement Urgently Requests Payment of Salaries

Although a Notice has been Issued for Payment, it Has Not Been Received - The Officers and Soldiers of the Garrison Detachment are Also in the Same Predicament

Since our army was ordered to withdraw from Shanghai on the 9th of this month, the highest military authorities ordered Cai Jingjun, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, to lead the police detachment under his command, the public training team, and the garrison detachment to cooperate with Zhang Bin's brigade of the 55th Division to defend Nanshi to the death. However, due to the weakness of the military strength and the lack of weapons and ammunition, they painfully retreated and tearfully surrendered their weapons. Many loyal and brave soldiers made heroic sacrifices. Zhong Yang, the company commander, took the lead and died for the country. Now, thousands of loyal and brave soldiers are trapped in the Settlement, suffering from hunger and cold, struggling on the brink of life and death, and unable to seek help. Although those in charge have published notices to pay salaries, the thousands of loyal and brave soldiers who are crying out for food have not received them. The news obtained yesterday is recorded below:

First Appeal

The entire police officers and men of the Special Detachment of the Police Headquarters submitted a document to the authorities on the 16th, appealing for assistance. The gist of it is as follows: 'Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, our police force has fought bravely and defended the Jungong Road for more than ten days without moving. Afterwards...they moved to Nanshi...with the determination to coexist and die with Nanshi. Since the contact on the 9th, although there have been small losses, there have been no major defeats. Who would have thought that on the evening of the 11th, when our entire team of officers and men were fighting fiercely, they suddenly received the order to withdraw and surrender their weapons...so they painfully retreated and tearfully surrendered their weapons...During these few days, our entire company has made heroic sacrifices, our company commander has died for the country, and the casualties of other officers and men are countless...Since surrendering their weapons, they have become defeated soldiers and captured prisoners. In the refugee camp, they are not well-fed or well-rested...and have all become refugees. The salaries of the police for more than two months have not been paid...The families of these thousands of police officers and men have become lonely souls waiting for death without help. The scene is too tragic to bear. Although Director Cai has published notices to pay salaries...if these salaries cannot be received, the lives of these thousands of police officers and men's families will be completely cut off...In this desperate situation, the police dare to report the situation and ask for help. The police hope for the following: ㊀ Please send senior officials from the bureau to visit and comfort them. ㊁ Please find a way to restore the freedom of the police. ㊂ Please set up a proper way to pay salaries...' and so on.

Another Request for Payment

Since the above document was published, many days have passed, and the three requests of the police have not been answered to this day. The Municipal Police Bureau recently published a notice stating that the salaries have been received and distributed by the leaders of each branch and team. It is heard that the police have not received them yet. However, the deadline for payment is tomorrow (the 25th). The police are extremely panicked, but the French Concession authorities are strictly monitoring them and will not easily let them go, and there is no way to receive the salary. The police have repeatedly and earnestly requested the French Concession authorities. The French Concession authorities ordered the police to make a detailed list of all their savings and salaries and negotiate to receive them on their behalf, but it has not been done. The thousands of police officers and men are even more panicked, and yesterday they presented another document to Director Cai: “To Director Cai Jingjun of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, we have read the bureau's notice that the salaries have been received and distributed by the leaders of each branch and team. However, the police have not seen a penny. Who has received this sum of money? Please investigate and distribute it. The police are here waiting to receive it. From the Special Detachment of the Police Headquarters, Fazheng College, Jin Shenfu Road, November 22nd.” It is deeply hoped that those in charge will understand the sorrow of their subordinates who have sacrificed their lives for the country and provide assistance to them.

Same Suffering

In addition, the garrison detachment organized by the Citizen Training Corps of this city is also drifting and helpless due to defending Nanshi to the death. Although the headquarters of the Shanghai Municipal Social Military Training Garrison Corps has repeatedly announced the payment of salaries, subsidies, and consolation money to show concern, the captains of each company and battalion of the team are scattered and hidden, and there is no address to be found. Now the team lacks clothing and food, and is plagued by hunger and cold. The living are sleeping on the streets, and the wounded are moaning in the alleys, which is extremely sad. Although the policemen of the team did not die for the country, their hearts of serving the country have not been seen by later generations. It is earnestly hoped that the authorities will devise a proper way to pay salaries, subsidies, and consolation money to maintain the future lives of these soldiers.

### The Reopening of the Deping Steamer is Realized, Departing from Shanghai for Ningbo Yesterday

The Blockade Line at Zhenhai is Guided by the Fortress - The Ningbo Compatriot Association Negotiates Navigation Methods - The Qihe and Others Continue to Operate on the Shanghai-Tongzhou Line

The Italian Huayi Company's Deping Steamer departed from the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund at 3:00 PM yesterday to Ningbo. It is hoped that it will continue to operate. The details are as follows:

Deping Leaves Shanghai for Ningbo

The Deping Steamer was repeatedly detained in Shanghai from the 17th because it received a telegram from Ningbo preventing it from sailing to Ningbo. A few days ago, the Ningbo Compatriot Association in Shanghai telegraphed the responsible authorities in Ningbo to request permission. The ship departed from the Jinliyuan Wharf at 3:00 PM yesterday to Ningbo. The number of passengers was quite crowded. After the ship arrives at the blockade line outside the Zhenhai Estuary, a ship will be dispatched by the fortress to guide it into the port. It is scheduled to depart from Ningbo at noon today (the 24th) and return to Shanghai, arriving on the 25th.

Negotiating Navigation Methods

It is hoped that the ship will continue to operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo line. The detailed methods of navigation have been negotiated by Wu Yaqin, sent by the Ningbo Compatriot Association in Shanghai, who took the Deping Steamer to Ningbo yesterday. Wu also carried four official letters from the Compatriot Association to the Ningbo Defense Headquarters, Zheng County Government, Ningbo Police Bureau, and Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the authorities do their utmost to maintain the traffic on the line when it is absolutely necessary, in order to facilitate the round-trip of passengers and the delivery of mail between Shanghai and Zhejiang.

Shenfu-Kai-Shen-Tai Line

According to reporters from Datong News Agency, in addition to the Shanghai-Ningbo line maintained by the Deping Steamer, the British Shenfu Steamer on the Shanghai-Taizhou line is also scheduled to depart today (the 24th), stopping at Dinghai and terminating at Taizhou. Tickets are sold and cargo is reported at the Taiji Business Company at 17 Fada Road. The ship is scheduled to depart at 3:00 PM.

Shanghai-Tongzhou Line Still Open

The foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line are the British Taikoo Company's Wuhu and Wuxue, the Jardine Matheson Company's Pinghe and Tonghe, and the Italian Huayi Company's Ende, totaling five ships. It is said that the traffic above Nantong has been cut off, but the above three shipping companies' ships on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line are still operating as usual, and passengers and cargo are still very crowded.

### American Nationals in Various Places Have Not Left Dangerous Areas

The U.S. Consulate Expresses Concern

According to news from the U.S. Consulate, there are currently two American nationals in Zhenjiang, three in Jiangyin, about ten in Nanjing, two in Huzhou, ten in Mogan Mountain, and five in Suzhou (in a village 40 miles from Suzhou City). The U.S. Embassy had previously advised American nationals in these places to leave the dangerous areas, but they have remained in their original locations to this day. The Consulate is quite concerned.

### The Climate Suddenly Turns Cold, First Snow Yesterday

Around 2:00 PM, Snow Fell for a Quarter of an Hour

The weather in Shanghai has been very cold in recent days, especially yesterday. The whole day was cloudy and gloomy, and the temperature dropped to 44 degrees Fahrenheit. Around 2:00 PM, it suddenly snowed. By 2:15 PM, snow pellets were falling, and the streets were covered with ice dots resembling pearls, making a sound as they fell to the ground. It stopped after about ten minutes. The north wind was biting, and the weather was very cold. Pedestrians on the road were all huddled up in a trembling state. This was the first cold snap since the beginning of winter.

### Yichang Water Level Drops Sharply

The water level of the Yangtze River in Yichang, upstream, has recently dropped sharply, and the rate is even faster than before. According to a telegram received by the Jianghai Customs, it has fallen to 3.29 meters (10.8 feet), which is an unprecedented record. According to the water gauge markings there, the water level is usually around 30 feet.

### Compatriots from Changzhou and Wuxi in Shanghai Seek News

Due to the delay in postal and telecommunications, compatriots from Changzhou in Shanghai are eager for news from home. It is heard that the association is now widely soliciting news. Those Shanghai compatriots who have come to Shanghai or have newly obtained news from their hometown are requested to come to the association at 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road, or call 34128 and 85155 to Mr. Xu Yuanqing, so that the news can be passed on to the compatriots.

The Wuxi Compatriot Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Wuxi County Government and the County Chamber of Commerce Relief Association, asking them to provide news. It also appointed Wang Xishen and Wu Guanli as the director and deputy director of hometown news communication, respectively, to facilitate communication of news and share it with compatriots in Shanghai. If compatriots have any news about their hometown, they should report it to the association at Qipu Road or call 40694 at any time. Before the 29th of this month, they can inquire at 81219. Reports of special news from compatriots are especially welcomed. Furthermore, the association will move back to its original address on Qipu Road at the end of this month.

### Refugee Population Statistics

According to a report from the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, as of the 22nd of this month, there were 145 refugee camps inspected by the department, accommodating a total of 87,083 refugees.

### Foreign Shipping Companies Gradually Plan to Restore Original Operations

The Empress Liner will Resume Sailing to Shanghai Next Month - North German Cargo Ships Will Arrive at the End of the Month

The Zi Lin Bao reports that reporters from the Zi Lin Bao inquired yesterday with several major shipping companies that regularly operated between Shanghai and European ports. They learned that the companies all hope to start cargo and passenger transport as soon as possible in a limited way. Some of the ships of one or two of these companies continued to arrive in Shanghai on schedule during the war, but were docked in a safe place in Wusong. Now they will resume using berths upstream of the Huangpu River. An employee of Changxing Company claimed that he expected the Empress Liner to resume sailing to Shanghai next month, but cargo transported to Shanghai still needs to be insured for 25%, as the authorities believe that Shanghai is still at risk of air raids. Of the seven Java Mail ships that usually come to Shanghai, four will now sail to Shanghai on schedule. The first ship, the Texelstroom, which entered the Huangpu River after the outbreak of the war, will moor at the Guanghua Wharf on Wednesday and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai the next day. The first ship, the Tegilsendary, which sailed directly from Hong Kong to Shanghai after the outbreak of the war, will arrive on December 2nd. Previously, the company's ships sailing to Shanghai from Hong Kong all passed through Dalian. In addition, the North German Lloyd will have four cargo ships arriving in Shanghai at the end of this month. However, since the outbreak of the war, no fast passenger ships of the company have arrived in Shanghai, but one may arrive before the end of this month. The company hopes to restore regular sailings to Shanghai as soon as possible, but will temporarily scale back its operations. Three ships of the Blue Funnel Line and two ships of the Jardine Matheson Company will arrive in Shanghai in the middle of next month. These are the first ships of the two companies to arrive since the outbreak of the war. The ships were originally scheduled to unload cargo in Singapore, Manila, and Hong Kong, but now, due to the changed situation in Shanghai, they can be released directly to Shanghai and will moor at the Holt Wharf in Hongkou. Other ships of the two companies to Shanghai have not yet been determined, but in the near future, they will be able to operate in a reduced program. The Great American Shipping Company and the Da Lai Shipping Company have not yet decided to send ships to Shanghai, but the Shanghai branches of both companies are eagerly awaiting news from their headquarters to restore Shanghai sailings. The ships of the Italian and French companies did not arrive in Shanghai during the Shanghai war. The two companies currently have several ships idle upstream of the Huangpu River.

### Vegetable Prices Slightly Rebound

The Reason is that Restaurants are Closed - Therefore, Supply and Demand Can Be Balanced

The market price of food in Shanghai has slightly rebounded as the supply is not as scarce as in the past few days. In particular, the price of pork has fallen the most significantly. Yesterday, two catties of pork could be bought for one yuan of legal tender in the vegetable market, while only one catty and eight taels could be bought a few days ago. The market price of vegetables is four yuan per picul for cabbage and the same price for radishes. Sweet potatoes are 2.6 yuan per picul, and retail soybean sprouts are 20 copper coins per catty, all lower than in the past few days. The reason is that most of the restaurants have temporarily closed because it is not easy to buy rice. The above-mentioned food is only supplied to households, so the supply can be balanced.

### Recent News on the Reorganization of the National Mutual Aid Association

In order to adjust its affairs and to make its purpose and name consistent, the National Wartime Mutual Aid Association has been reorganized. The original name has been changed to the National Relief Mutual Aid Association. All relief affairs that are handled will continue, actively expanding the scope of services. In addition to the resignation of Liu Jingfang, the former treasurer, and the dismissal of one or two other people, most of the committee members are said to have been re-elected. Zheng Xuehai has been appointed as the honorary treasurer.

### The Shanghai Power Company Holds a Guidance Tea Party

Welcoming Housewives to Participate - On-Site Demonstration of Electric Stove Efficiency

The Family Service Department of the Shanghai Power Company on Nanjing Road has received repeated requests from electric stove users in recent days. Therefore, it has scheduled to hold another guidance tea party at the company's sixth floor this afternoon (the 24th). At that time, all housewives who are interested in kitchen management will be welcome to participate and freely express new ideas. For example, the preparation of dishes, the layout of the dishes, and how to create surprises in cooking can be freely proposed for discussion. During the tea party, Mrs. Taylor, director of the company's Family Service Department, will also demonstrate the efficiency and economic benefits of the electric stove. According to the greatest feature of the electric stove, the high-heat, fast-heating iron plate does not change the color of the vegetables during cooking, and the nutrients and deliciousness are fully preserved. Secondly, the heat controller on the oven ensures that the cakes and pastries are evenly colored and textured. As for roasting meat, the heat is even, making it extremely crispy, tender, and delicious. All of these points cannot be achieved by other cooking methods. Therefore, the electric stove is a perfect guarantee for housewives to entertain friends and guests and prepare delicious food. It is expected that this guidance tea party will be beneficial and interesting to all attendees.

Current Commentary

### The Epilogue of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

— Yi

The world-renowned Nine-Power Treaty Conference is now in a regrettable deadlock. The common attitude advocated in the first declaration was not discussed at all by the representatives of various countries at the plenary session on the 22nd. Representative Gu from our country issued an urgent appeal at the meeting, but did not receive a response from the representatives of other countries. On the surface, this conference seems to have tolled the death knell.

In fact, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will not make any decisions on practical and effective common action. This could have been foreseen at the beginning of the convocation. Because to thoroughly resolve the Far Eastern crisis, the Nine-Power Treaty on which this conference is based is far less applicable in nature than the League of Nations Covenant. If we want the Sino-Japanese issue to be resolved smoothly, there was hope only by using the League of Nations mechanism. The original purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was mediation. When mediation is impossible, issuing an empty declaration is considered to have completed its task.

However, although the declaration is empty, it ultimately expresses the intentions of various countries. The transition of this intention to effective action is really only a matter of time. At present, the major powers are afraid to take another step forward due to environmental difficulties, but any difficulty will always be broken one day. Because the Far Eastern security issue has the greatest weight among all international issues. This is what the politicians of any major power must do their utmost to resolve.

I feel that in the dark situation, there is still a glimmer of light.

### Charitable Organizations Relieving Stranded Refugees

Food and Clothing Severely Lacking, Hoping All Sectors Will Provide Assistance

The weather has turned sharply cold in recent days. Stranded refugees in the International Settlement and the French Concession lack food and clothing. If they don't starve to death, they will freeze to death. Various charitable organizations are doing their best to raise food and clothing, but it is still far from enough. They hope that all sectors will do their best to provide assistance. The following is a brief summary of the relief work of various organizations:

Red Swastika Society to Investigate Inland Areas

After the outbreak of war on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, most of the residents of the Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou regions fled with our troops towards Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jinhua, and other places. Various native place associations in Shanghai are concerned about their hometowns and have been discussing investigation and relief matters for days. It is now learned that the World Red Swastika Society sent six people, including Wang Daoyuan, on the German ship "De Ping" to Ningbo yesterday afternoon, and from there to various places for investigation. Therefore, many native place associations have entrusted them with investigation, and relief matters will be carried out as the opportunity arises.

Fengxian Refugees to Register

The reception of fellow Fengxian villagers who fled to Shanghai to take refuge is now being handled by the Pudong Native Place Association. All fellow villagers seeking shelter can contact the Pudong Native Place Association office on the sixth floor at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road from today onwards to register and avoid wandering.

The Western United Association Appeals for Donations

The Shanghai Western United Benefit Association believes that the north wind has been howling and the weather has suddenly turned cold in recent days, and the refugees in various districts have run out of supplies. Even if they do not starve to death, they will freeze to death. The miserable scene of wailing is difficult to describe in writing. In addition to trying to provide a large amount of food, the association finds it difficult to provide widespread relief due to the large number of people and the vast amount of supplies needed, even if it exhausts its own resources. Therefore, the association continues to appeal to all sectors for donations to jointly support this good cause and extend humanitarian aid. The most needed items are cotton clothing, cotton quilts, white rice, flour, bread, large cakes, steamed buns, etc. Please notify the association by telephone at 35627, and they will send someone to collect the donations. Your merit will be immeasurable. The association received the following donations yesterday: large cakes and steamed buns, totaling 2,000 from Ma Fook Kee, 7,700 from the staff of Shen Jiu Kee, 1,000 from the staff of Li Xin Accounting School, and two large sacks from the staff of the Municipal Council Police. In addition, the Feng Mansion donated nine bags of flour, Mr. Shan and others from the US-Asia Fourth Factory donated 12 yuan in national currency, and Mr. Lu donated 5 yuan. Mr. Cheng donated one yuan and Wu Yushu donated five yuan to purchase supplies.

Refugee Freezes to Death on Medhurst Road

At about 1 p.m. yesterday, a refugee (male) about 50 years old froze to death at the entrance of Rui'an Lane at the intersection of Medhurst Road and Singza Road in the International Settlement. According to residents there, the refugee had been living at the entrance of the lane since the outbreak of the August 13th war. He used to make a living pulling a rickshaw, but now he is stranded there because his employer fled to his hometown. He was from Haimen and had a wife and children. His body was collected by Pushan Villa in the evening. It is also learned that there are still many male and female refugees, old and young, in that area who have no place to live and are living in the open air, exposed to the wind and dew, and are in imminent danger. It is hoped that philanthropists will quickly go there to find ways to provide relief. Your merit will be immeasurable.

### Sufficient Supply of Prepared Coal in This City

Enough to Meet Demand for Three Months, Very Suitable as Fuel

Most of the coal in this city is stored in Pudong, Nanshi, Zhabei, and other places. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai war, these areas have become war zones, and imports have suddenly decreased sharply, resulting in fuel prices soaring by more than 150%. Middle and lower-class families are quite panicked. Recently, it has been difficult to transport out even a small amount, but demand exceeds supply, and prices remain high. According to an investigation with the Shanghai Gas Company, there is still a large amount of prepared coal stored in the Shanghai Prepared Coal Company, enough to meet the city's needs for three months. It is very suitable for both hot water furnaces and household coal stoves, and its firepower is stronger than white coal, with no odor. The price has not increased much compared to before the war, making it an economically sound fuel.

### Old Zha Police Station Cracks Down on a Major Gang of Robbers

Two Killed on the Spot, Nine Men and Women Arrested

Yu A'gen, the chief detective of the Old Zha Police Station, along with detectives Wang Shanqing and Min Zhaoxian, western detective Mai Kaitian, Huar, and more than 20 others, went to Rooms 207, 208, and 209 of the East Asia Hotel at 9 a.m. the other day (19th) to arrest bandits. At that time, a shootout occurred in Room 209, resulting in three bandits being shot and killed by the detectives. Western detective Huar's right little finger and left thumb were broken by bullets. It is now learned that the dead bandits were named Wang Dabaozi (37 years old) and Xiao Hubei (30 years old). The name of the other one is unknown, but he was about 34 years old, and the bullets hit his head, abdomen, and other parts. In the three rooms, seven bandits from Jiangbei were successively arrested: Sun Caigui (aka Xiao Erzi), Dai Xiaowangzi (aka Dai Guisheng), Zheng Zongtian, Zhou Jianru, Chen Xin, the woman Du Ni (named Gui Zhen), and Deng Li. Three Mauser pistols, 95 bullets, two revolvers, 13 bullets, three hand grenades, a bayonet, and clothing, ornaments, silver dollars, etc. were seized. Subsequently, in Lane 16, No. 313 on Mabille Road and in a shed on Singapore Road, two women, Chen Wang and Chen Shao (aka Wu Ma), were arrested. It was found that they had committed numerous robberies within the settlement. According to the confessions of the suspects, the cases include 1) No. 11, Lane 215, Medhurst Road, 2) No. 4, Lane 43, Jinlong Street, Da Feng Paper Company, and 3) No. 20, Lane 203, Hubei Road. In the Medhurst Road case, they even shot and injured the buttocks of a woman, Ms. So-and-so. This morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyers Ru Bao'yi and Li Zhishan presented the case, requesting a postponement for further investigation of the case and the arrest of accomplices. After questioning by Judge Huang Risheng, the judge approved the remand of the suspects and postponed the hearing.

### Sanitary Facilities Resolved in the Nanshi Refugee Area

Food and Clothing Still Needed, Expanded Scope for Sheltering Women and Children, Daily One-Cent Campaign Participated in Enthusiastically

The various relief efforts in the Nanshi refugee area, after careful planning by Father Rao and the staff of the International Relief Committee, are gradually progressing in an orderly manner, and especially in terms of sanitation, there has been a good phenomenon. According to the New Life News reporter, the streets in the area, which were previously dirty and foul, have been largely cleaned up after continuous sweeping by district. As for the refugee hospital, in addition to the one already established on Wanzhu Street, another one has now been added in Houjiabang. Both have taken in seriously ill refugees, and there are even more people seeking temporary outpatient treatment. In addition, there are also two maternity hospitals for refugee mothers, one next to Deyilou in the City God Temple and one on Anren Street. The committee has hired several obstetricians and midwives from various Catholic churches to work together. Therefore, the working conditions in the refugee area can be said to have been resolved.

Raising Food and Clothing

Currently, more than 7,000 poor households in the refugee area are relying on the International Relief Committee for sustenance. Registration is still ongoing, and the number is expected to continue to increase. In terms of supplies, light cakes, steamed buns, and "mo mo" are still being provided. However, after Father Rao's best efforts, 1,600 bags of white rice will be purchased soon. In addition, the International Relief Committee is also purchasing a large amount of rice from Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, and it is expected that once fuel such as coal and firewood can be arranged, rice meals can be provided to the refugees. In the past two days, the International Committee has sent out more than 1,500 cotton quilts and more than 5,000 cotton clothes, but the shortage is still huge, and it is hoped that all sectors will donate.

Enthusiastic Donations

All sectors are concerned about the suffering of the refugees, and the donations of food and funds to the International Relief Committee are particularly enthusiastic. The committee continued to receive 1,000 yuan from Wu Nan Kee yesterday, a letter from a former consul-general stationed in Shanghai sending the remaining 6,279 yuan from a donation from overseas Chinese for refugee relief, 305 yuan and 58 cents from the Shanghai Saturday Society, 300 yuan from Madam Chen, the mother of Mr. Cheng of Ruihua Lane, Lafayette Road, 500 yuan each from Shao Bingsheng and Shao Zhixian, and 2,000 yuan in savings accumulated over the years from the four siblings Shen Lianzhi, Shen Jiuzhi, Shen Changguan, and Shen Quanguan. In addition, the committee has launched a daily one-cent campaign to help refugees. This method is easy and inexpensive, and participation from all sectors is particularly enthusiastic.

Donation From Profits

The Bo An Duo Si Electric Bulb Factory and the Greater China United Electric Bulb Distribution Office in this city, in view of the fact that the food supply for refugees is still insufficient despite the enthusiastic donations from all sectors, and that they are suffering from hunger and cold, which is painful to witness, have specially organized a joint office to reduce the price of their "Five-Use Duo Si Ruyi Bulb" for discount sales and donate the profits for relief. Although the price of raw materials is soaring, they are still selling at the original price and donating the profits for relief. This has been implemented since the 20th of this month. Yesterday, they sent staff to negotiate with the International Relief Committee to set aside 10% and submit it every five days for the relief of fellow citizens in distress.

### Great Panic Among People's Boats in Caojiadu

More than 30 civilian boats parked on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek in Caojiadu, which were loaded with goods from the inland to Shanghai, did not have time to withdraw when our army moved west. Recently, enemy gunboats have been traveling back and forth there every day, and they have taken away the boat of the Consolidated Tax Bureau card parked on the south bank, causing panic. Yesterday, the boat owners moved all their luggage and belongings to the shore and fled.

### No Penalties for Stamp Tax Before Order Arrives

The Ministry of Finance, according to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's telegram of October 15, requested that inspectors be informed to waive penalties during the period before the order regarding the temporary measures for collecting stamp tax in extraordinary times arrives. The Ministry of Finance approved the telegram. The Ministry's order for the temporary measures for collecting stamp tax in extraordinary times, announced this time, should take effect from the date specified in the schedule of effective dates of laws promulgated by the National Government, in accordance with Article 1 of the Regulations on the Date of Implementation of Laws. Before this order takes effect, if there is any violation, penalties may be waived. In addition to ordering the stamp tax inspectors to comply with this, you are hereby informed.

### Large Amounts of Smuggled Goods Imported After Suspension of Anti-Smuggling Work

All are Knitted Goods Dumped on the Market, Factories in This City Panicked

The Shenshi News Agency reports that after the Jianghai Customs' large and small patrol ships were all robbed, the anti-smuggling work has been completely suspended, and the import of smuggled goods cannot be stopped. According to a reporter's reliable information, a large amount of smuggled goods was imported in the first batch yesterday, unloaded at the Mitsubishi Wharf. All are knitted goods such as stockings, which will be dumped on the market at surprisingly low prices, much lower than the cost of manufacturing in Shanghai. Therefore, the knitting industry in this city has been panicked. Several knitting factories, which were originally scheduled to resume business within the day, are therefore temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude.

### French Municipal Council Registers and Returns Lost Vehicles

In view of the fact that rickshaws and other vehicles in the Special District have been scattered in various parts of Nanshi, the French Municipal Council has specially sent political personnel to notify the Rickshaw Industry Association of the Special District, requesting them to inform all vehicle owners to bring the licenses and certificates issued by the French Municipal Council to the Da Zimmingzhong Police Station to register between 8:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. and between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. every day, and then wait to retrieve their vehicles.

### Chairman of the Municipal Council Commends the Shanghai Volunteer Corps

The Chairman of the Municipal Council, F.C. Millington-Drake, sent a letter to the Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Graham, stating that, "Now that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has been reorganized into a peacetime establishment, I would like to take this opportunity to express my admiration to the members of all ranks on behalf of the Municipal Council. The organization of your corps has given me a good impression. The members of all ranks of your corps have executed their orders in an orderly manner and assisted the police in maintaining law and order." Commander Graham replied with a letter of thanks, stating, "I am grateful for your words."

### Relief for Poor Households in the Refugee Area

Cloth Strips Issued Daily as Symbols, Many Die From Cold and Hunger

Food rice had been cut off long ago in the refugee area within the city, and there was also a group of poor households who originally lived in the refugee area within the city who had not had rice for a long time. Even flour was not sold in the area. Therefore, the International Relief Committee notified the households in the area that, after registering with the committee, each household would be issued a cloth strip symbol based on the number of people in the household after investigation. Each day, they could use the cloth strip with the number of refugees listed on it to collect supplies from the Yishengtang Pharmacy at the intersection of Fangbang Road and Anren Street, so as to eke out a living. However, in recent days, the weather has been cold, and many have died from cold and hunger. Although they are collected and placed in thin coffins, the roads are blocked and there is no place to bury them. Floating coffins are often seen on the roadside.

### Wang Yiting Donates Funds to Help Refugees in South Shanghai

Mr. Wang Yiting, a leader in the charitable circles of this city, although he left Shanghai a few days ago, is still extremely concerned about the refugees in Shanghai. He has now donated 100 yuan in national currency, which was delivered by his son, Ji Mei, to Mr. Qu Wenliu, the chairman of the International Relief Committee, for the relief of refugees in the southern district.

### British Infantry Relieved

The North China Daily News reports that the 1st Battalion of the British Highland Light Infantry will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 23rd) on the Dilwara mail ship to replace the 5th Battalion of the Royal Ulster Rifles. The Ulster troops are scheduled to leave for Hong Kong on Thursday. It is said that a part of them will go to Hong Kong, a part will go to Palestine, and the rest of the British troops will remain in Shanghai, so the strength has not been reduced.

### Temporary Night Schools Universally Established in Municipal Council Schools

The primary and secondary schools established by the Municipal Council were universally established in various districts before the war. After the outbreak of the war, they were moved to safe areas. However, due to the large number of students, and because most of the other private schools were closed, in order to prevent adults and school-age children from losing their education, temporary night schools have recently been universally established in many places.

### Robbers Arrested in Asia Hotel Robbery Case

Six Robbers Arrested One After Another, Stolen Goods From a Brothel Confiscated

Wu Zhenghua, who opened a rice store in Yangjiadu, Pudong, heard about the outbreak of the Shanghai war, and because the area was close to the war zone, he took his family to Shanghai to take refuge in Room 237 of the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII.
