### Our Army Entered North Szechuan Road Last Morning After Clearing Out Remnants of the Enemy

Yesterday's Two Artillery Battles Inflicted Heavy Losses on the Enemy; Flying General Liu Tsui-kang Shot Down Two Enemy Planes

Our Army's Fierce General Offensive with Heavy Bombardment This Morning

On the Zhabei front, our army, taking advantage of the darkness, launched a surprise attack from Qiujiang Road and other locations towards the enemy forces on North Szechuan Road at midnight yesterday. The enemy hastily responded, putting up a stubborn resistance from buildings like the Shanghai Grand Theatre. After two hours of fierce fighting, our army valiantly advanced and completely cleared out the enemy forces in the Shanghai Grand Theatre area. Our army has entered North Szechuan Road and will join forces with our troops from the former Hongqiao area to simultaneously encircle and annihilate the enemy forces south of Qiujiang Road, east of North Szechuan Road, north of Suzhou Creek, and west of Felling Road. Simultaneously, they will advance north along North Szechuan Road, crossing the Henghama River to attack the enemy's Marine Corps Headquarters. It is reported that yesterday, an enemy naval attach√© met with foreign journalists and openly admitted that our army had advanced to the vicinity of the Shanghai Grand Theatre.

After 1:00 AM this morning, fierce fighting had already broken out in the Hongkou area, and the sound of gunfire drew closer to the Broadway Road area. After 3:00 AM, the sound of artillery suddenly erupted continuously, indicating very intense fighting. According to our military authorities, this was a full-scale offensive by our side. As of 5:00 AM this morning, the sound of artillery had not yet ceased.

Enemy Forces' Position Increasingly Desperate

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Since our army occupied the Whangpoo Wharf, the enemy's reinforcements have had no chance to land, and their battleground has become increasingly narrow. The enemy forces in the Yangshupu Broadway Road area are now surrounded on three sides by our forces. Although they still hope to fight like cornered beasts, they have no ability to resist. Starting yesterday morning, they began setting fires themselves and using airplanes to drop incendiary bombs, burning down all the buildings. On the one hand, they intended to use the flames to stop our advance, and on the other hand, they wanted to destroy the buildings to prevent them from being used by our army. As of this morning, the fires have not yet been extinguished, which shows that the enemy has exhausted all means and resorted to this measure. Our army is still advancing through smoke and fire. According to those returning from the front lines, our army had charged to the Dinghai Bridge area around 4:00 PM yesterday. The enemy forces, with their backs against the wall, were in a state of utter confusion and fled to their ships. The entire front line is on the verge of collapse. The day of annihilating the enemy cannot be far off.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Our army stormed into the enemy's rear, occupied the Whangpoo Wharf, and, while constructing defenses, launched attacks on the enemy from various directions. The enemy forces on the western side also launched a fierce counterattack on our positions with a large number of armored vehicles, hoping to fight like cornered beasts. From the night before last until yesterday morning, both sides engaged in bloody battles for more than twenty hours. The fighting was especially fierce last night. The enemy suffered casualties everywhere, and our side also sustained considerable damage.

According to official sources, our army has completed the central breakthrough plan after occupying the Whangpoo Wharf. Starting yesterday morning, they resumed their advance eastward towards Xihua Road, East Broadway Road, and the area around the Inner Hongqiao, continuing to advance. The remaining enemy forces will soon be eliminated. The enemy forces who retreated and gathered near Xijiao were fiercely pursued by our army and completely wiped out. According to enemy soldiers captured by us in this area, the enemy forces have lost their fighting spirit since suffering heavy losses in the Whangpoo Wharf battle. Although they repeatedly attempted to counterattack the night before last (the 20th), they were ultimately unsuccessful and are extremely panicked. The enemy forces are now surrounded by our army. Although they are fighting like cornered beasts, it only shows that they are becoming increasingly desperate. As for the enemy's 12th Division (the 128th Regiment of this division once sent a mixed brigade to China to participate in the war, the so-called Kurume Mixed Brigade), although a portion has landed and is fighting, the majority is unable to land and participate in the war because the base areas in the Hongkou area of eastern Shanghai are shrinking. They plan to find a place to land in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, but our defenses are heavily fortified and this is absolutely impossible.

Enemy Ships Closely Packed, Bombarding Wusong

Special dispatch from this newspaper. Outside Wusong port, enemy ships are densely packed, forming a long snake formation. Around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, they opened fire and bombarded our positions, but without any clear target. The shells all landed in the fields. Our artillery regiment retaliated, with fierce artillery fire. The battle lasted about two hours. The enemy fleet moved away to the waters of Sanxia, and one enemy ship was sunk off the coast of Paotaiwan, with only the mast remaining visible above the water. The name of the ship is unknown. Although enemy planes circled in the sky, they did not dare approach our army's positions, only dropping bombs randomly from a distance. After being attacked by our anti-aircraft guns, they fled in disarray. The Central News Agency reported that the enemy's remnants north of Suzhou Creek were completely surrounded by our army and have completely lost hope. They must find another way out in order to restrain our army. Last night, they concentrated their forces and advanced towards Wusong, but our army's defenses were heavily fortified and launched a long-range artillery strike. The artillery fire was particularly fierce, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The enemy's landing attempt completely failed.

Zhaofeng Road Has Been Occupied by Us

The Central News Agency reported that after our army cut off the enemy's communications and advanced in two directions, it made rapid progress on the front lines in the Hongkou area. The day before yesterday, we firmly occupied Zhaofeng Road, which runs across the northern bank of Suzhou Creek within the concession. Before our army reached Zhaofeng Road, two Swiss merchants who operated hotels on the south bank of Suzhou Creek went to warehouse number 476 on that road to retrieve stored wine. At that time, the area was guarded by Japanese troops. The merchants obtained passes from the Japanese, but our army suddenly arrived, and the merchants were stranded in the war zone. Because they did not have passes from our side, they could not leave. After learning of this, the Swiss Consul in Shanghai, Ge Fenglei, went to the Shanghai Office of the Garrison Headquarters of the Nanjing-Shanghai Area at 4:00 PM yesterday to request that Commander Zhang be asked to find a way to return the merchants to the south bank of Suzhou Creek. Our side is currently trying to find a solution.

Two Artillery Battles Yesterday Afternoon and This Morning

The Dagong News Agency reported that around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a small number of defeated enemy soldiers gathered in the Japanese merchants' warehouse area along the Huangpu River, attempting to cross the river to Pudong by ferry. They were discovered by our army, which opened fire with machine guns. The enemy also returned fire from the docks, warehouses, and buildings. For a time, the sound of artillery and machine guns filled the air. However, in less than fifteen minutes, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated.

The Central News Agency reported that another artillery battle began at 0:30 AM today. Initially, enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River opened fire and bombarded our Pudong and Nanshi areas. Our artillery positions immediately retaliated. At the same time, another artillery position also opened fire, launching a coordinated attack. Our artillery fire was concentrated on the enemy positions in the Yangshupu area and on the enemy ships in the river, with accurate targeting. The enemy suffered heavy losses. After about forty minutes, the sound of artillery gradually subsided.

Enemy Attack on Bailonggang Immediately Repelled

Because of the continuous defeats in the Hongkou area, the enemy's newly dispatched reinforcements from Japan were unable to land in Shanghai. Moreover, because our army's defenses were heavily fortified at all ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the enemy attempted to land at Bailonggang in Chuansha. However, our garrison in that area was well-prepared and responded calmly. As reported in the newspapers for several days, enemy warships suddenly sailed to the port yesterday morning, fully loaded with soldiers. They first bombarded the shore with artillery. Our army remained hidden and did not fire a single shot. The enemy then approached the shore in small boats. Our army suddenly opened fire with machine guns. As it was still dark, the enemy boats hurriedly attempted to escape, capsizing many. In the end, they were unsuccessful. Our army suffered no losses.

A Bloody Battle to Attack the Enemy's Nest

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) According to reliable reports, after the enemy's positions were cut into two sections by our forces, our forces on Jiangwan Road and Qingyun Road were ordered to advance. However, from the day before yesterday until dusk, progress was limited because it was daylight and enemy planes frequently came to wreak havoc. After 7:00 PM the night before last, attacks were launched simultaneously on the enemy's headquarters from various directions. Our army used a large number of mortars to concentrate firepower and cover the infantry's advance. At the sound of the order, everyone bravely charged forward. The enemy hastily responded, and a bloody battle ensued. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and our side also sustained some losses. Around 12:00 AM, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated southward. Our army took advantage of the victory and pursued them. When they reached the foot of the north wall of the headquarters, they were stalemated for a long time. Around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, amidst earth-shattering cries of killing, they bypassed the enemy's fortified headquarters and advanced more than 100 meters to the south. The enemy forces formed tightly packed ranks and retreated to the area south of the end of North Szechuan Road and north of Hengbang Bridge. Only a small number of troops on the front lines were still putting up a stubborn resistance, but the enemy's courage had been broken, and the entire front line was on the verge of collapse.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, this newspaper's reporter met Private Liu Linsheng, who had returned wounded from Jiangwan Road at dawn yesterday. According to Liu, he provided a detailed account of our army's attack on the Japanese headquarters on Jiangwan Road the night before last. The following is a record of his account:

The Japanese headquarters on Jiangwan Road has been damaged by our army's artillery fire and air force since the beginning of the war. However, the walls there are constructed of three layers of thick steel plates, so at first glance, the exterior still appears intact, but the interior has been a chaotic and devastated mess. At the same time, there is also a cellar inside, which seems to be connected to the enemy's main force in the vicinity. Therefore, although the headquarters has been surrounded on three sides by our army, its remaining troops still appear in broad daylight from time to time to fire at us, but soon they become silent again, as they have once again retreated into the walls. Our army knows that they are cunning and decides to ignore them, continuing to surround them heavily, thinking of capturing them in one fell swoop. At 8:00 PM the night before last (the 20th), our troops stationed at the Patriotic Girls' School, Cantonese Eastern Middle School, and Chih Tze University on Jiangwan Road were ordered to encircle and attack the headquarters, with the aim of destroying the enemy's nest. At that time, our large mortar and heavy artillery teams were dispatched to provide cover. At the sound of the bugle, guns and artillery fired simultaneously, and our army was spirited and brave, all vying to be the first to use extremely agile tactics to rush towards the enemy's nest. At that time, the Japanese army was caught off guard and became panicked. After the enemy officers used force to suppress them, they barely managed to fight back. Heavily suppressed by our artillery fire, the enemy gradually became unable to withstand the attack. Fortunately, their reinforcements arrived, and they were able to hold their ground. Thus, the fierce battle began again. Our army fought with the enemy using hand grenades and bayonets, disregarding their own safety. For a time, bullets rained down, and flesh and blood flew everywhere. The sound of our army's battle cries shook the heavens. The enemy soldiers advanced and retreated repeatedly several times. After more than four hours of fierce fighting, around 12:00 AM, the enemy soldiers suffered heavy casualties, and blood flowed like rivers. Finally, they were unable to withstand the attack and retreated completely from the headquarters, retreating south along Diswei Road on North Szechuan Road. I (Liu himself) was also wounded at that time (injured, but still clear-headed, and witnessed our troops advancing more than 100 meters east of the enemy headquarters. The subsequent progress is not known because I was already unconscious. However, I now know that a solid position has been built by our army in that area). In addition, there is one more thing worth mentioning: a few days ago, when we were ordered to attack Jiangwan Road and occupy the Japanese positions in the Patriotic Girls' School, Cantonese Eastern Middle School, and Chih Tze University, there were more than a dozen Japanese soldiers in the Patriotic Girls' School. Because the surrounding area had already been surrounded by our army, they were unable to escape and were disarmed and captured by our army and sent to the rear for imprisonment. At this point, the reporter, fearing that Mr. Liu was tired after speaking so much, thanked him and wished him a speedy recovery.

Izumo Repaired, Bombarding Pudong

The flagship Izumo of the Japanese Third Fleet suddenly turned its hull yesterday morning, changing from facing west to facing east. At 11:08 AM, it moved from the riverbank at Lujiazui to temporarily moor in front of the Shuntai Wharf, and it was stoked up ready to depart. The three funnels of the ship had not been seen smoking for a long time, but dense smoke was visible from yesterday afternoon onwards. In addition, an enemy cruiser moored in front of the Nisshin Y≈´sen Kaisha wharf also moved away from the wharf. Around 5:00 PM, the No. 1 enemy torpedo boat, which had been at the edge of the Bund Garden, also moved to the center of the river, and at 5:20 PM, torpedo boat No. 23 also sailed to that location, seemingly to protect the Izumo warship in the rear.

The Central News Agency reported that the enemy flagship Izumo, which had been damaged by one of our explosive devices, seemed to have been completely repaired after being moved to the No. 2 buoy opposite the Gonghexiang Wharf for repairs. It test-fired its engines once yesterday morning and sailed to the China Merchants Bureau Central Warehouse Wharf, before sailing back to its original mooring. Suddenly, at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, it began firing artillery to bombard Pudong, firing one shell every minute for half an hour continuously. It is said that many civilian houses in Pudong were destroyed.

### Our Air Force Frequently Displays Its Power, Enemy in Wusong and Hongkou Suffers Heavy Losses

Liu Tsui-kang Shoots Down Two More Enemy Planes

The Central News Agency reported that at about 7:00 AM yesterday morning, multiple of our bomber planes and a squadron of fighter planes flew to Shanghai to bomb the enemy's frontline around Hongkou and Yangshupu. Our bomber planes, under the protection of the fighter planes, then flew to the port of Wusong to bomb the enemy ships. Subsequently, at about 8:00 AM, they encountered about thirty enemy planes. A fierce battle immediately broke out. Our flying general, Mr. Liu, who had flown to Shanghai on the 17th and defeated the enemy planes, once again performed meritorious service yesterday, shooting down two enemy planes. At the same time, several other enemy planes had their wings damaged by our planes. Our air force safely left Shanghai and returned at about 9:00 AM.

The Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st of August -- A squadron of our air force's bomber planes and fighter planes flew to Shanghai at about 7:00 AM on the morning of the 21st to bomb the enemy's positions and enemy ships. They encountered multiple enemy fighter planes. Our planes bombed while simultaneously fighting fiercely with the enemy. All of the predetermined targets were hit by our bombs, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. Our air force hero, Liu Tsui-kang, shot down two enemy fighter planes in succession. The wings of all of our planes were also hit by bullets, but there was no major damage. They safely flew back at 9:00 AM.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Yesterday morning, our air force once again went to the Huangpu River to bomb Japanese ships and buildings along the river to facilitate military operations. At around 8:00 AM, three bomber planes first circled in the high sky for a long time. Enemy ships fired anti-aircraft guns together. Our planes flew down through the barrage of shells and dropped two bombs in succession, one hitting the Maochang Air Conditioning Factory and the other hitting a certain building behind the North Machinery of the China Merchants Bureau. In an instant, the sky was filled with fire and the burning was intense. The enemy army also dispatched four seaplanes to take off and fight our air force. Four enemy planes surrounded one of our planes. Both sides opened fire with machine guns. Yesterday morning, six of our air force planes continued to drop bombs and bomb the last stronghold of the enemy forces around Yangshupu Road and East Broadway Road. Houses near Shuntai Wharf and the Nanyang Company caught fire, and the burning was very intense. Until noon, the smoke still covered the sky. According to those who escaped from Huaji Road, most of the houses in the East Broadway Road area were burned down, and the enemy forces, who were holding out, had no place to hide and were in great panic.

### Great Fire All Day in Eastern Shanghai

Japanese Commercial Center a Scorched Earth

The Central News Agency reported that at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, multiple places in the Shenjiawan, Wenjianshi Road, Haining Road, Zhabu Road, Wusong Road, Gongping Road, and Tilanqiao areas were hit by bombs and caught fire. The burning was very intense, and the fire was still burning at night, lighting up the sky. Shenjiawan, Wenjianshi Road, Haining Road, and Wusong Road and other places are all concentrated commercial areas for Japanese expatriates in Shanghai. After this great fire, they have become a scorched earth, with nothing left. The Japanese expatriates will also hate the crimes of their country's warlords. (Another report) At 8:00 AM on the morning of the 21st, the northeast wind was quite strong, and fires broke out in the following places: „äÄ Near the Zhoujiazui kerosene wharf, „äÅ West of the Nanyang Tobacco Company on Broadway Road, „äÇ Huaji Road, „äÉ The intersection of Hanbi Li Road and Wuzhou Road. At 8:22 AM, there was also a large fire about a quarter of a mile east of the Huade Road Prison. At 9:30 AM, a fire also broke out at the intersection of Broadway Road and Gongping Road.

Four Thousand Civilian Houses Turned into a Field of Rubble

The Shenshi News Agency reported that the civilian houses behind the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company on Broadway Road in Hongkou, along Huade Road, Zhaofeng Road, Tangshan Road, Dengtuo Road, Gongping Road, Maohai Road, Kunming Road, and the surrounding areas, no less than three to four thousand houses in total, were a bustling urban area in eastern Shanghai. At 9:00 AM on the 20th, when the enemy was retreating, they set fire to the area, and the flames soared into the sky, spreading very rapidly. Because it was located in the center of the war zone, the fire brigade was unable to go to the rescue, so the fire was allowed to burn for a full day and night. By yesterday morning, three to four thousand civilian houses in the area had been completely reduced to ashes.

British and American Warehouses Reduced to Ashes

At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, enemy planes flew to the area of our army's positions in Nanshi and Pudong and dropped bombs, hitting the British-owned Jardine Matheson & Co. warehouse. At the same time, the No. 3 wharf of the Taikoo Dockyard at the Rotten Mud Ferry was bombed and destroyed, and it immediately caught fire and spread. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the No. 3 warehouse of the British-owned Lundon & Co. in Lujiazui was also bombed by Japanese warships, and it immediately caught fire. Two million yuan worth of cotton in the warehouse was completely reduced to ashes. The Japanese side disregards international law, as can be seen from this.

Enemy Headquarters Hit by Bombs and Burning

At about 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, several places in the Hongkou area of eastern Shanghai caught fire, and the headquarters of the Japanese Navy Landing Force at the end of North Szechuan Road, a strong building covering an area of more than 20 acres, was the most difficult stronghold for our army to conquer. Unexpectedly, it was suddenly hit by a bomb dropped by our air force at this time and caught fire at the same time. Looking out at the high walls surrounding the headquarters, they stood like cliffs, with flames soaring into the sky in the middle, looking like a large furnace. When the reporter filed the report, the fire in the headquarters was raging.

### More Than a Hundred Enemy Soldiers Crossed Suzhou Creek and Were Disarmed Yesterday

Sheltered Separately by British Barracks - The Enemy's Lack of Fighting Spirit is Clearly Evident

At about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers who had fled from the Hongqiao Broadway Road area to the southern end of the Waibaidu Bridge on the Bund were disarmed by the British soldiers stationed there and taken to the British Military Headquarters at the Racecourse for imprisonment. At dawn yesterday morning, seven Japanese plainclothes teams, under the command of the Japanese army, crossed the Waibaidu Bridge from Broadway Road. At that time, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps stationed at the southern end of the bridge, because they did not have passage permits, carried out an inspection and found two live ammunition pistols. They immediately confiscated them and took them to the Central Police Station, which transferred them to the British Military Headquarters.

The Central News Agency reported that since our army occupied the Whangpoo Wharf area, the enemy forces were in a state of utter disarray and fled across the Waibaidu Bridge to the south. Yesterday evening, more than a hundred enemy soldiers fled across the bridge to the south. After being disarmed by the British army, they were sent to Jiaozhou Road for custody.

The Central News Agency reported that in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, more than three hundred Japanese soldiers who had been defeated and retreated across the Waibaidu Bridge to the south were disarmed by the British soldiers stationed at the southern end of the bridge. In the evening before last, they were sent separately to the Racecourse and Gordon Road British barracks for resettlement. At about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, about two hundred people were transferred to the Japanese Ordinary Elementary School on Jiaozhou Road by the British army, and more than a hundred people were sent to the Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill factory on Binlang Road, with the British army stationed in both places.

### Self-Description of Masao Nakamura, a Prisoner of War Captured by Our Side

Tears of Homesickness, Words from the Heart - Ironclad Proof of the Enemy's Lack of Fighting Spirit

When a certain unit of our army occupied the enemy's naval training ground, it captured a part of the enemy army and sent them to the rear the day before yesterday, where they were accommodated in the prisoner of war camp and treated very well. Among them was a person named Masao Nakamura, who had lived in Shanghai for a long time and could speak a little Shanghainese. After being captured, he was initially very panicked, stammering and answering sometimes in Shanghainese and sometimes in Japanese, but the answers were always irrelevant. The reporter saw that his speech was quite similar to someone who had received a considerable education, so in order to understand the Japanese army's fighting psychology, he struck up a conversation with him in Japanese, occasionally mentioning stories of his interactions with Japanese friends when he studied in Japan. Nakamura listened silently, and after twenty minutes, the reporter saw that he looked sad, as if he could not bear the thought of his homeland, so he took the opportunity to ask about his family. According to him, he graduated from a higher school and worked as a shop clerk for five years, with a decent life. He has an old mother, wife, and children at home. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, news has been cut off, and he fears that they have suspected that he has met with an accident. Tears welled up in his eyes as he spoke. The reporter then asked him about his impressions of this war. He remained silent for a long time. The reporter then stated that he was willing to discuss with him as a friend, and he finally told the reporter: "From a personal point of view, I feel that this war is meaningless, because in fact it is of no benefit to Japan, and in the past, some Japanese people who were anesthetized by propaganda held hostile attitudes towards the Chinese, which is very incorrect. When I was stationed in Shanghai, I was often moved by the kindness of the Chinese, especially this time when I was captured on the battlefield. At first, I thought I would suffer cruel retaliation, but I never expected that your country's officials would treat me so kindly." The reporter then took out paper and asked him to write a few words as a memento, and he immediately wrote (see copperplate), roughly meaning: I am Private First Class Masao Nakamura of the Special Naval Landing Force. As a result of this war, I have become a prisoner. When I was captured by the Chinese army, I asked myself if I had fallen into danger, but unexpectedly I was treated with special kindness and guidance by the Chinese army. This is extremely grateful. The reporter saw that he was very tired, so he shook hands with him, said goodbye, and left.

Commentary

### A Comprehensive View of the Shanghai War

‚Äî Yong

The Shanghai war has broken out. Almost ten days have passed. Our troops are marching day and night, bringing provisions with them. In these ten days, there have been no unfavorable battles. Up until now, the remaining enemies are making a last-ditch stand. Command can be determined. People of maritime nations are expressing their admiration. However, what should be a source of comfort to the entire nation is the knowledge that the impact of this battle is not limited to just one side.

Everyone knows that the Japanese have been plotting an invasion. On one hand, they rely on their elite forces, feeling invincible. On the other hand, they disregard the nature of the international settlement, constructing headquarters and other bases. They managed and operated these with the belief that their plans were foolproof and that they would be able to conquer everything. However, in just ten days, we have crushed them like dry weeds, chasing them north. They can only rely on deep trenches and strong fortifications as their last refuge. They are only able to prolong their survival by a thread. Their superior weaponry, which they flaunted to the world, has now been completely exposed for what it is. This is the first impact on the Japanese military.

The Japanese are plotting against us, advancing from both the north and the south. In the September 18th Incident, they easily seized the three northeastern provinces. They then coveted what was within the passes of the Great Wall. After the Lugou Bridge Incident, they aimed to swallow everything. After Tianjin and Beijing fell, they immediately attacked Nankou in the north, aiming to take Chahar and Suiyuan. However, in our all-out resistance, we vowed to fight them to the end. We therefore gained the upper hand. Not only are enemy troops sparse in Changping and Shahe, but we have also announced the recovery of Chongli in northern Chahar. They are betting everything on reinforcements. Moreover, the Shanghai war has also created a situation where they are constrained and restricted. As a result, our troops on the Jinpu Railway have crossed Jinghai. The Pinghan Railway line is gradually making progress. When the south is in urgent need, the north is weakened, so Chahar and Suiyuan can be preserved, and Tianjin and Beijing will be easier to recover. This is another impact on our northern military operations.

The Japanese navy has been constantly trying to stir up trouble in our seven coastal provinces. Qingdao and Shantou are often disturbed. They are relying on their old habits, trying to take advantage of any opportunity. However, due to the constraints of the Shanghai war, they have had to restrain their ambitions. As long as we maintain a strong defense, we can protect ourselves calmly. Even their air force, which has been developed over a dozen years, can only cause chaos in our rear areas, even with their wanton destruction. They cannot seize our land. Moreover, the losses they have suffered are astonishing. They cannot sustain this for long. They have been repeatedly defeated. Therefore, the resistance in one area has alleviated the difficulties of the coastal areas. This is another impact on the overall situation.

Although Shanghai is a small area where countless brave soldiers have shed their blood and countless resources have been destroyed, the impact of this is a hundred or even a thousand times greater than this. The people of Shanghai will certainly not begrudge the sacrifice of this gilded and extravagant lifestyle in exchange for defending the nation. The tall buildings and heavy curtains, even if they are reduced to ashes in an instant, can be restored as quickly as one looks forward to recovering the beautiful mountains and rivers north of Zhangbei and Nankou. What Bao Sui contains cannot be compared in the same light. Trading that for this, it is understood that Shanghai is willing to endure the destruction and use scorched earth to resist the enemy, and is doing what it should.

However, this battle is raging in Shanghai, and Shanghai is already the front line. Because Shanghai is the front line, the provinces in the south have begun to have some stability and are like the rear. So shouldn't the rear areas strengthen their responsibility to support the front line? Shanghai has always been known for its dense population and abundant food and goods. However, once war breaks out, the dense population increases the risk to food and security. The abundance of food and goods also loses its regulatory circulation because it cannot be transported. Manpower and resources are the same principle. The military in the front is winning victories after victories. The rear is stable, and responding to matters is even faster. The government and the people have been doing their best to help Shanghai. However, if the provinces in the rear can be more thorough and sympathetic, then problems such as transportation, food, and refugees can be solved with the collective wisdom and efforts of everyone. It is my sincere wish that all people in the country, at the beginning of this war of resistance, make the greatest contribution and fulfill the most important responsibility to Shanghai in the front, so as to exert the effectiveness of the overall situation.

### Fighting Broke Out North of Jinghai

Enemy Attack on Our Position Repelled, Our Guerrilla Team Occupies Shilibu, Report Says Advance Troops Reached West Railway Station of Tianjin

[Jinan] Enemy reinforcements have arrived at the Jinpu front line. Fighting broke out north of Jinghai at 3:00 this morning. The enemy attacked our position and Jinghai city, but were repelled by us.

The Japanese army has set up defensive works, and is now focusing on the areas on both sides of the railway line in addition to the railway line. On the morning of the 20th, more than 1,000 people came from the Haiguang Temple barracks and went south to the West Railway Station to deploy defenses. The Japanese troops originally stationed in villages such as Balitai and Chaomidian in the southern suburbs of Tianjin have been transferred back to Tianjin City in large numbers in recent days, and the newly arrived troops have been sent to replace them. (Central News Agency dispatch from 21st)

### Japanese Planes Again Attack Nanjing and Hangzhou

Four Enemy Planes Shot Down Around the Capital, Japanese Aircraft Carrier Moored in Xiangshan Ocean

[Nanjing] News from the transportation sector: The time to annihilate the enemy army in Shanghai is not far away. On the morning of the 21st, at about 4:00, enemy planes continued to carry out air raids on Nanjing. Our air force intercepted them and forced them to the vicinity of Yangzhou, where several were shot down. At about 8:00, enemy planes flew over the Zhenjiang airspace, and our air force fiercely attacked them again. The enemy planes could not withstand it and fled in disarray. It is said that many were injured. At 6:00 in the evening, several enemy planes approached the suburbs again and were forced back by our planes. (Dispatch from 21st)

[Nanjing] More than ten enemy heavy bombers suddenly attempted to fly to Nanjing for a night raid at about 4:00 on the morning of the 21st. When the enemy planes reached the vicinity of Yangzhou, our planes had already risen to intercept them. The two sides met and immediately began to engage. After a fierce battle of about half an hour, three enemy planes were shot down. One fell and caught fire in Yangzhou, and the other two fell between Dongtai and Taixing counties. The remaining enemy planes fled in panic. It is said that one of our planes was slightly damaged, but it did not affect combat. (Central News Agency dispatch from 21st)

[Nanjing] According to news from official circles, the air raid alarm sounded again early this morning, and residents were awakened from their sleep and rushed to find places to hide.

### Wounded Pilot Transferred to Nanjing for Treatment

Madam Chiang Personally Offered Consolation

[Nanjing] Pilot Wang Kewen was dispatched to bomb Shanghai but unfortunately was hit in the leg by enemy machine-gun fire and was forced to land in Zhenjiang. He did not receive medical treatment until six hours later. Due to excessive blood loss, the doctor said that a blood transfusion was necessary to save him. After this news spread, 40 to 50 people in Zhenjiang volunteered to donate blood to save him. Madam Chiang, Secretary-General of the Aviation Commission, heard about this and, because the equipment in Zhenjiang Hospital was not as good as that in Nanjing, ordered him to be transferred to Nanjing for treatment. She personally went to the hospital to comfort him on the evening of the 21st, for as long as half an hour. According to the doctor, the wound on his leg is now inflamed and will have to be amputated. Wang said with great emotion: "I have been born and died twice. What is one leg worth? I am only afraid that once this leg is gone, I will never be able to get on a plane again and fight the enemy, which I will regret."

### Thirty-Two Traitors Brought to Military Law Department for Punishment

For Disrupting Security in the Concession, Each Criminal Had Symbols and Secret Markings

The Public Concession Police Department is extremely concerned about security within the concession during the Sino-Japanese War. In addition to the deployment of considerable defenses by British and American troops and the Volunteer Corps at the border between the Chinese and foreign concessions and Hongkou, more armed Western detectives have been dispatched to patrol back and forth day and night. Therefore, the concession has been able to remain calm and business has gradually recovered. However, a group of crazy traitors still lurks within the territory from time to time, creating rumors and disturbing people's hearts, causing unnecessary disturbances from time to time. Therefore, the detectives have paid special attention to this group of criminals. In recent days, as many as 32 people have been arrested. Each person has symbols and secret markings. They are being held at the Chengdu Road Police Station. After our garrison headquarters learned about this, because the actions of these people not only disrupt security, but also endanger the lives and property of foreigners, they sent a special letter to the Public Concession requesting extradition. After the police agreed, at 4:00 PM yesterday, special investigators Liu Zhaokui and Feng Ziyue from the Concession Police Department escorted the criminals to Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, where they were handed over to the receiving personnel of the garrison headquarters to be taken back to the Military Law Department for strict investigation and punishment.

### US Ambassador to UK Returns Home to Confer with Roosevelt on the Overall Situation in the Far East

Suggestion to Establish a Neutral Zone in Shanghai; Japan's Reply to Britain Vague; French Foreign Minister Receives Ambassador Gu

[London] The US Ambassador to the UK, Bingham, boarded the Queen Mary liner this morning and set off for home. According to well-informed sources, Bingham's return home is related to the Far East incident. President Roosevelt of the United States wants to consult with Ambassador Bingham on the Far East issue. According to Bingham's plan, he was preparing to go to Fluehlen, Scotland, for vacation, but suddenly received a call from President Roosevelt, so he hurriedly set off for Washington via Quebec, Canada. He will stay in the United States for about ten days before returning to his post. (Havas from Central News Agency on the 21st)

[Washington] British Ambassador Sir Lindsay visited US Undersecretary of State Welles today to discuss the Far East situation. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on 20th)

[Washington] State Department officials acknowledged today that the United States and Britain are discussing joint action in Shanghai. The content is that if the Chinese and Japanese armies agree to withdraw, the United States and Britain will jointly be responsible for protecting the Public Concession. However, a spokesman for the War Department believes that the British plan may not succeed. (National Telegram on the 19th)

[Paris] Prime Minister Chautemps received Chinese Ambassador Dr. Gu Weijun today. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on 21st)

[London] Regarding the British government's suggestion to set up a neutral zone in Shanghai, the Japanese government has submitted a reply to the British government, which is ambiguous. British officials hope that Japan can submit a concrete reply, but they are afraid that the Japanese government will strongly oppose the British suggestion to withdraw troops, and therefore it is difficult to change its attitude. British officials also declared, "The Japanese side is hesitant and has made unfavorable comments, which has deeply disappointed the British government." (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on 21st)

[London] The British government notified the Chinese and Japanese governments that if British expatriates in Shanghai suffer losses to life and property due to Sino-Japanese military actions, the British government reserves all rights to claim compensation. The British government also protested to the Japanese government because the Japanese army occupied British-owned properties in the Public Concession, saying that even if there is a necessary reason for the occupation, compensation must be paid. If any losses are caused by the occupation, additional compensation must be paid. Therefore, the British government will submit this request within a reasonable period of time. The Japanese government's attitude towards the UK's restoration of law and order in Shanghai remains doubtful. It is necessary to wait for the final reply from Japan before it can be clarified. However, according to news reports, the Japanese government is very hesitant to accept this proposal. Therefore, the British political circles are very disappointed, but they still hope that Japan will recognize the serious responsibility contained in rejecting this proposal. This proposal aims to end the costly and dangerous armed conflict in Shanghai, so that the expatriates in the Public Concession, including the Japanese, can be safe. The plan to establish a neutral zone in Shanghai was carefully formulated by British and other countries' diplomats, consuls, and army and naval authorities. It can be said to be a pragmatic approach. According to the opinions of the neutral observers in Shanghai, once the Japanese army and naval reinforcements withdraw, the Chinese army will have no reason to attack any part of the Public Concession again. Once the Japanese expatriates in Shanghai can be guaranteed safety, there will be no reinforcements needed. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 11th)

The cabinet has discussed a new bill, which will be submitted to the parliament in early September, to transform Japan's entire economic organization into a "wartime state."

### Japanese Aggression Unbridled

British and American Public Opinion Unanimously Condemns

[London] The London Economic News editorial today stated that Japan's reckless aggressive attitude has long completely lost the sympathy of the world. The newspaper supports the British government's demand for compensation for losses, but says that the disruption of commerce is of such magnitude that it cannot be fully compensated. The newspaper further stated that China's internal development in recent years has qualified it to accept a large amount of foreign investment. Therefore, while Japan is doing everything possible in Manchuria, Britain and other countries are helping China to consolidate its commercial relations. For example, the reform of China's financial organization is largely due to the efforts of the British government's economic adviser, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, and the Sino-US silver transaction has also further consolidated China's economic position. Therefore, China's integrity and independence are of great importance to several major powers, not only related to moral principles. (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)

[Washington] The Washington Post discussed today that whether Japan wins or loses the war, this kind of unbelievable atrocity cannot justify itself. However, throughout history, there have always been great nations who do not hesitate to risk moral condemnation and sacrifice their national future in order to satisfy their insatiable desire for aggression. However, Japan's current rampant and violent behavior, disregarding the impact on world civilization, is unprecedented in history. Although Japan's weapons are strong, they are not enough to withstand the anger and hatred caused by its naked and undisguised barbarism. (Central News Agency, 20th, Reuters)

[New York] The New York Times published an editorial today, detailing the increasing danger of alarming disasters, saying that the northern Chinese army, now under the command of the central government, has risen up to resist the enemy. Chairman Chiang and his colleagues are determined not to sacrifice several northern provinces to make peace with Japan. The New York Herald Tribune said that President Roosevelt's attitude towards the bombing of the US flagship Augusta was very proper, "because neutral observers should be prepared to take risks." It is also proper for the authorities of the French Concession to prohibit airplanes from flying over the French Concession. Furthermore, American newspapers also published the tactics adopted by Japanese warships, which extinguish their lights in the middle of the night and sneak up to the side of the US flagship Augusta, using the US warship as cover to fire at China, which is considered extremely shameless. The New York Herald Tribune said, "In order to avoid desecrating the dignity of the newspaper, it is best not to comment on this kind of behavior." (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)

### Roosevelt Convenes Cabinet Meeting to Discuss Sino-Japanese War

The Flagship is Hit by a Bullet, Causing National Uproar; Negotiations are Handled on the Spot

[Washington] The US flagship "Augusta" was hit by stray bullets, killing one sailor and injuring eighteen others. The news spread here, and all newspapers published it in large characters, causing an almost national uproar. Some members of Congress believe that the time has come for the United States to declare neutrality. US Navy personnel said that the commander of the Asian Fleet will soon lodge a serious protest with both China and Japan. President Roosevelt said that no matter what method is adopted, the US authorities in Shanghai can decide on their own. When asked whether US warships would retaliate, the President said that this kind of incident is almost inevitable under such circumstances, and the application of the Neutrality Act must wait until China and Japan formally declare war. Furthermore, Secretary of State Hull regarded the attack on the "Augusta" as an "unfortunate incident." In addition, the "Augusta" incident was also discussed in detail at President Roosevelt's weekly cabinet meeting. Afterwards, the President did not announce whether he had discussed taking any formal action, but one cabinet member said that there had been no decision on the Neutrality Act. Chairman McReynolds of the House Foreign Affairs Committee strongly advocated the adoption of the Neutrality Act. The "Augusta" incident was indeed unfortunate, but he firmly believed that the President's postponement of the declaration of neutrality was the right approach. While the United States should negotiate with the Chinese and Japanese authorities, it also knows that this kind of bombing was not intentional, and the application of the Neutrality Act should wait until the true situation is determined. (Central News Agency, 20th, Reuters)

[Washington] President Roosevelt recently convened cabinet members to discuss the Far East situation, with particular emphasis on the "Augusta" incident. Although people here say that it is still unknown where the shells that hit the ship came from, one cabinet member confirmed that, as far as he knew, the "Augusta" was hit by a Japanese bomb. (Central News Agency, 20th, Havas) The English-language Ta Mei Wan Pao reported that this morning (21st), the US Naval Investigative Service held its first meeting to investigate the case of the US fleet flagship Augusta being hit by bullets, killing and injuring sailors. Most of the time this morning was spent on organizational matters, but testimonies were taken from several eyewitnesses at the time. The meeting will continue this afternoon. The investigation team is composed of Lieutenant Commander Kinkaid, Lieutenant Commander Cabiney of the US Naval Medical Corps, and Lieutenant Alan, and has the power to summon witnesses and punish those who are contemptuous. According to a spokesman for the Augusta, the shell was a stray bullet, and there is little doubt about this. The most difficult thing now is to determine where the bullet came from. It is not yet certain whether the results of the investigation team's work will be published in Shanghai. The official report will probably reach the Washington government first. Of the eighteen injured sailors, five were seriously injured, but it is said that none are in danger of life. "

The Continental Daily News reported that the US Asian fleet, which was docked outside the Huangpu River, had a shell explode on its rear deck at 6:40 p.m. on the 10th, while about 200 sailors were watching the fires in Pudong and Bubbling Well Road in the cool breeze. The explosion killed Second Class Seaman Fargot and injured 18 other sailors. The deck was not damaged. According to the US Navy Commander, the shell must have been fired from a howitzer and is currently under investigation. The remains of the deceased sailor have been sent to the International Funeral Parlor, and most of the injured have been sent to the US Fourth Marine Regiment Hospital for treatment. The US Commander has reported the matter to the Chinese and Japanese authorities and is not filing any protests. The Commander did not specify which side fired the shell, only saying that the matter is under investigation. According to a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, the commander of the foreign navies stationed in Shanghai has not asked the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet to move his warships to a location five miles away from the warships of neutral countries. When asked whether the Japanese warships would comply if such a request were made, the spokesman replied that he did not think they would move. It is also heard that personnel from the American Consulate in Shanghai have expressed informal opinions to the Chinese authorities, stating that the American warships are docked in the Huangpu River to protect the lives and property of American citizens, and therefore do not want to move.

### The Enemy Concentrates Forces to Attack Wusong Again

The Most Intense Artillery Battle Unfolded at Dawn This Morning; The Enemy's Attempt to Land Reinforcements Completely Failed; Enemy Ships Fiercely Bombarded Pudong for One Hour This Afternoon

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) After the enemy's left and right wings were attacked by our army from the central route and suffered repeated failures, their contact was completely cut off. The remnants of the enemy north of the Suzhou River have been heavily surrounded. The enemy had no choice but to seek another way out, and last night concentrated its forces to attack Wusong, intending to land there. Enemy ships were densely deployed like long snakes outside the mouth of Wusong and at the mouth of the Huangpu River, totaling more than 40 ships, using intensive artillery fire to try to cover their advance. This reporter took a detour to the rear of the area this morning. According to a military official, the enemy's artillery fire was most intense in the middle of the night. After our heavy artillery team dealt them a heavy blow, the sound of artillery gradually disappeared at about 4 o'clock. At dawn this morning, a very fierce artillery battle broke out again between the two sides. For a time, artillery fire filled the sky, and the sound was heard hundreds of miles around. By 8 o'clock this morning, the sound of artillery gradually subsided, and the enemy's attempt to land at Wusong had completely failed.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) The enemy continued to send the first division of reinforcements to Shanghai, which has been unable to land for many days. The second division of reinforcements, which was sent yesterday evening, also arrived outside Wusong on four large merchant ships, protected by warships. Because of the failure of the Shanghai battle, there was no place to land, so they were trapped on the sea. Enemy ships in Shanghai sailed out of the Songkou last night and carried out intensive artillery bombardment of Wusong, attempting to land the army. As a result, they were still repelled by our army.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Five of our bombers flew to the enemy's positions at 2:30 this afternoon to bomb them. Enemy ships in the Huangpu River hurriedly fired anti-aircraft guns in succession, but our planes were unharmed. Dozens of bombs were dropped on the enemy's Hongkou positions, and enemy ships were bombed outside the mouth of Wusong. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) As of 3:00 p.m. today, our army's front line has reached near Yangshupu Road in the east and the bank of the Yokohama River in the west, making contact with our troops advancing to North Sichuan Road. The Central News Agency reported that, according to official sources, our army's right-wing front line has indeed reached North Sichuan Road, and that the road has indeed been occupied by us.

### Artillery Battle in Pudong This Morning

Our Shells Hit the Enemy's Warships' Vital Parts; One Corner of the Hongxing Wharf Was Damaged

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Enemy ships in the Huangpu River fiercely bombarded our Pudong positions again at about 1:00 p.m. today. Six enemy planes also circled over Pudong to conduct reconnaissance. Our army also calmly returned fire, and the fierce battle stopped after an hour.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) At 0:40 a.m. this morning, our army in Pudong fiercely bombarded the enemy forces in the direction of the Mitsui Wharf. It was most intense at about 1:00 a.m. After a brief pause at 2:00 a.m., our army bombarded that area again with more than 30 shells at 4:20 a.m. At that time, a warship in the Huangpu River returned fire at our army. Our artillery then concentrated its fire on the warship. At that time, many people along the Huangpu River witnessed the enemy warship being hit in its vital front part by our shells after firing only four or five shots. They personally saw the warship flee in a panic.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) At about 4:00 a.m. this morning, Japanese warships in the Huangpu River fired shells at the Pudong area. One shell hit the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong, damaging one corner of the wharf. Three patrolmen on the wharf were seriously injured by the shells and have been sent to the hospital.

### The Enemy Headquarters is Surrounded

The Remnants of the Enemy are Concentrated in Tiantong Road and Other Places; Sandbags are Piled up at the Bridgehead of North Sichuan Road

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Our army ordered a general offensive on all fronts after 3:00 a.m. this morning. The artillery fire on both sides was extremely fierce, and the sound of machine guns and rifles could be heard clearly. The fierce battle lasted until 6:00 a.m. this morning, and the sound of gunfire gradually subsided. As a result, our army made progress on all three fronts. The enemy's Mutsu Detachment headquarters is now surrounded by our army, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them all within days.

When a reporter from the Dagong Daily News inspected the south bank of the Suzhou River, he saw a truck loaded with sandbags driving from Huangpu Road to the bridgehead of the North Sichuan Road Post Office. The sandbags were unloaded by 17 enemy troops and plainclothes agents who were hiding in the area, and piled up on the north bank of the Suzhou River along the mouth of North Sichuan Road to form a large concave-shaped fortress. At the same time, there was similar action at the Second Baidu Bridge. It seems that the enemy is concentrating its forces in the area again to prepare for military action.

It is confirmed that the enemy troops who retreated from the Gonghexiang Wharf area yesterday, except for a portion who retreated into the Wai Baidu Bridge and were disarmed by the British army, concentrated in the area of Laobazi Road, Zha Pu Road, Haining Road, Guangdong Street, Tiantong Road, Wusong Road, and Peng Road, and stubbornly resisted, making a final struggle.

### We Advance Towards Wusong Road

A Small Number of Enemy Remnants Have Been Completely Surrounded; They Can Be Thoroughly Eliminated Within Days

Since our army occupied the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road from Qiujiang Road on the evening of the 21st, the Yongfeng Building has also been occupied by our army. Therefore, the connection between the enemy's left wing and the Japanese Army Headquarters at No. 10 Dongjiangwan Road has been completely cut off. At the same time, our army is now advancing towards Wusong Road in order to contact the central army and completely surround the small number of remaining enemy troops trapped in Hongkou Park and Diswei Road, so as to thoroughly eliminate them within the next day or two.

The enemy troops in the Yangshupu East District have been in a three-sided encirclement since our army occupied the Huishan Wharf. Except for retreating to the Huangpu River and boarding ships to escape, there is no other way to go. Therefore, the remnants of the enemy are extremely panicked. Last night, a certain artillery team of our army fired cannons to threaten the enemy in that area. Because the gunners fired accurately, many shells landed in the enemy's positions, causing fires in many places. Our army has now advanced to near Dinghai Bridge. The enemy is in a state of panic and is fleeing to the Huangpu River. The enemy troops in the East District can be eliminated immediately.

After our army occupied the positions in the Huishan Wharf area, it built strong defensive works and prepared to wait for an opportunity to attack. After the enemy's defeat, they also set up a final line of defense along Yangshupu Road and East Broadway Road, hoping to resist stubbornly. According to refugees who escaped from Yangshupu this morning, the enemy troops in Yangshupu are forcibly conscripting civilians to pile up sandbags and build defense works. Those who resist slightly are stabbed with bayonets. Therefore, the residents in that area are now fleeing. Our shells can directly bombard the enemy's positions in Yangshupu, and the explosive force is quite strong. It was seen that a civilian house was hit by a shell and immediately collapsed. The enemy troops were quite panicked. Except for a few sentries scattered at various intersections, the rest of the enemy troops were hiding behind sandbags and in civilian houses.

### The Enemy Digs Trenches in Zhaofeng Road

Merchant Corps Armored Vehicles Head to Hongkou to Rescue Two Swiss Nationals in Danger

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Because two Swiss staff members of the Swiss Yongchang Foreign Company were trapped in a warehouse at the corner of Zhaofeng Road and Zhoujiazui Road, and that area is now entirely in the hands of our army, the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Latel, planned to rescue the two Swiss nationals from danger yesterday afternoon. At 7:15 p.m., the Public Works Department dispatched two armored vehicles from the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to escort them. They saw Japanese troops digging trenches and ambushing near Zhaofeng Road. The Nanyang Tobacco Company's warehouse was on fire. They planned to advance towards Tangshan Road, but the Japanese troops had set up barbed wire at the corner of Zhaofeng Road and Tangshan Road, and they could not advance any further. Electric tram wires were scattered on the road. At the corner of Dengtuo Road and Broadway Road, they were detained by the Japanese troops for half an hour. They planned to advance towards the Hongkou Police Station, but they were not allowed by the Japanese troops. Finally, they returned at 10:00 p.m. without any results.

### Fires in the Hongkou District Burn Like Mountains

Spreading to the End of North Sichuan Road and Other Places; The Asiatic Petroleum Depot is Also Burned Down

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Fires in various places in Hongkou burned like mountains throughout the day and night, and the burning was very severe. According to reports from various sources, the most tragic burning locations were the entire areas of Zhaofeng Road, Dengtuo Road, and Tangshan Road. The flames spread from the corner of Zhaofeng Road and Broadway Road to Yuezhou Road and Hongkoubang in the northwest, and to the east of the Diswei Road Police Station in the south. The burning area in the East District was near the public yarn factory on Yangshupu Road, the gas station at the corner of Dinghai Road and Zhoujiazui River, the Hudong Asiatic Petroleum Depot, and near a former school on Ningguo Road. To the west was the Maotai Foreign Company's warehouse at the corner of Broadway Road and Gongping Road, the north end of the Lester School on Broadway Road and Xihua Road, and the west end of Gonghexiang Wharf along Broadway Road was also on fire. As of noon today, the fire has spread further, and the end of North Sichuan Road and Peng Road and other places are also filled with flames. The losses amount to tens of millions.

‚ñ≤Defense Line of the Western Concession in Shanghai‚ñº

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) The defense line of the Western Concession in Shanghai, from the Suzhou River along Hongqiao Road to Bailinan Road, was formerly guarded by the British Army's Royal Regiment. Starting yesterday, it was taken over by the marines of the British warship Cambria, and the army was transferred to other places.

### Enemy Planes are Active in the Nanshi Area

One Has Been Hit in the Tail by Our Fire; Seven Bombs Were Dropped in Pudong with No Losses

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) At 5:30 a.m. this morning, three enemy planes flew along the Huangpu River to reconnoiter the 16th Pier and Pudong areas. At 7:15 a.m., three more enemy planes came, flew back and forth over our Nanshi area several times, and dropped two bombs in a certain place. They were immediately driven away by the encirclement of our anti-aircraft guns.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) At about 7:00 a.m. today, eight enemy planes flew to Pudong and dropped seven bombs, all of which landed in open areas, so there were no losses.

At dawn at about 6:00 a.m. this morning, four Japanese bombers and two reconnaissance planes flew to our army's Nanshi positions to circle and reconnoiter, and dropped a large number of bombs, attempting to destroy them. They were fiercely bombarded by our army with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, and the enemy planes scattered and fled. When this reporter went to investigate at 8:00 a.m., according to the garrison in the area, the last plane was hit in the tail by our fire, and thick smoke was emitted, but where it landed is now being searched.

### The Izumo Warship Moved East Last Night

Firing Cannons wildly at Our Army's Positions; It Returned to Gonghexiang Wharf Again This Morning

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) After the enemy's flagship Izumo was fiercely bombed by our air force and artillery, it moved to the No. 2 buoy in front of the Gonghexiang Wharf. Yesterday morning, it raised its fires and moved east downstream, and stopped in front of the Shuntai Wharf and the China Merchants Bureau's Middle Wharf, firing wildly at our positions in Pudong. Last night, the ship moved further downstream and sailed to the Yangshupu River surface to stop, firing wildly at our army occupying the various areas of Yangshupu. Our army's positions were not damaged in the slightest. This morning, the ship returned to the area between Gonghexiang Wharf and Shuntai Wharf from the Yangshupu area. A enemy cruiser is still docked outside the Japanese Consulate. The torpedoes No. 1 and No. 23 outside the Baidu Bridge have been removed.

### Peking Steamer Daringly Enters Port

After Reaching Shanghai, It Immediately Loaded Refugees and Sailed for Ningbo; The Ningxing Steamer Turned Back Outside Wusong

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The Taikoo Company's Ningbo route steamer, the Xin Peking, came to Shanghai from Ningbo. Due to the outbreak of artillery fire in Wusong, the steamer was blocked on the sea surface outside Chongsha and unable to enter. It was not until this morning, when the battle in Wusong subsided slightly, that the steamer dared to enter the port, arriving in Shanghai at 10:30 AM. According to personnel on board, the intensity of the artillery fire in Wusong this time was extremely alarming. There were many large Japanese merchant ships and warships anchored at the mouth of Wusong, and the ships were filled with large numbers of reinforcements. The steamer set sail for Ningbo that day. Before the ship arrived, the pier was already crowded with passengers. This ship was the first steamer to enter the Shanghai-Ningbo route after the start of the war. The Ningxing steamer of the Sanbei Company was chartered by the Ningbo Association to transport Ningbo refugees to Shanghai. With the consent of the Public Works Department obtained by Yu Qiaqing, the flag of the Public Works Department was displayed for import and export to ensure safety. Unexpectedly, the steamer was on the sea surface outside Chongsha when it heard the sound of heavy artillery fire last night, fearing danger if it continued to sail, and telegraphed at 7:55 AM this morning that it had returned to Ningbo.

### All Prisoners on Ward Road Transferred to the Concession

The Public Works Department Obtains the Consent of Both China and Japan; Curfew on Nanjing Road to be Lifted Today

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At 12:30 PM today, nine public buses, escorted by British soldiers, American merchants, and police officers, went to the Ward Road Prison in the west of the city to successively transport all the prisoners out of danger. When passing through Nanjing Road, traffic was temporarily cut off, and three armored vehicles escorted the buses all the way west. Traffic was restored at 1:00 PM.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The world's largest prison, the Ward Road Prison in this city, has been decided to be abandoned after a meeting of the consular body and the Public Works Department. For humanitarian reasons, except for those sentenced to death or life imprisonment, all will be released if possible. All prisoners will first be evacuated from the south of the Suzhou Creek. The transfer will begin today, and it is planned to complete it all in four or five days.

Evacuating a Thousand Prisoners Daily

Police Deputy Inspector-General Baus is currently managing this matter. It is said that all procedures have been prepared, and it is planned to send 1,000 to 1,500 Chinese prisoners across the concession to the Chinese area every day. In this way, it can be completed in four days. The Chinese Red Cross is preparing to assist in passing the Chinese prisoners through the front lines of the Chinese army and sending them to the rear. If time permits, the prison authorities plan to give each prisoner a small amount of clothing and food, as well as their own belongings, so that they can survive. As for the approximately 300 prisoners currently being treated in the prison hospital, the Health Department will assist in evacuating them to other hospitals in the concession.

Russian, German, and Other Foreign Prisoners

The most difficult are prisoners who do not enjoy consular jurisdiction, such as Russians, Germans, Pillan people, Greeks, Latvians, etc. These prisoners will be allowed to choose whether to follow the Chinese prisoners to the Chinese area and be released, or to enter the concession with other Western prisoners and be held in the police detention center until their term expires. However, those who are eligible for parole will still be considered for release.

Shell Hits Corner of Building

In the past few days, the food supply for the Western prisoners and 6,000 Chinese prisoners in the prison has not been a problem, and it has been delivered by special vehicles of the police. In the past six days, the prison has been completely under artillery fire. On Monday, a shell hit the corner of a building, killing eight Chinese prisoners and wounding more than seventy. Some prison cells were also destroyed. British and other foreign prisoners detained on Ward Road have all been taken away.

Both Sides Express Agreement

On the side of the Public Works Department, Lawyer Bolang, the director of the Legal Department, has contacted the responsible persons on both the Chinese and Japanese sides. The Chinese side has expressed its approval in principle, but cannot acknowledge it in writing. The Japanese side initially expressed its willingness to do its best to help evacuate the Ward Road Prison and stop military operations in the surrounding area, but later said that it needed to reconsider. It was not until late last night that it fully expressed its approval.

### Japanese Army Admits Failure to Invade Nankou

Our Army Occupies an Extremely Advantageous Position on All Sides; Enemy Infantry and Artillery Have Collapsed and Retreated to Langfang

‚äôGui Sui The entire front line of Nankou was still in mixed fighting on the 21st. Our army occupies an advantageous position on all sides, attacking fiercely. The enemy army suffered heavy casualties and had no possibility of invading the mountain pass on any side (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)

‚äôNanjing Military news: At 8:00 AM on the 21st from Huailai, the enemy in the Nankou area added a brigade of troops in the Omura area and launched a fierce attack on the right wing position of our Huanglaoyuan. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, our army fought bravely, counterattacking repeatedly, and the position remained firm. The enemy army on the front launched a fierce attack on Juyongguan and was ambushed by our army, which was defeated and killed many enemies. More than a hundred people were killed by landmines. The enemy at Yongning launched an attack on the 20th and is currently engaged in fierce fighting (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)

‚äôNanjing News from the transportation sector: Approximately 1,600 to 1,700 enemy infantry and artillery troops who arrived in Langfang from Ping are in extremely embarrassed shape. It is reported that they were retreating from the Nankou area. In addition, the enemy troops on the Ping-Sui Railway were extremely busy being transferred north a few days ago, and troop trains continued to move north. In recent days, they have suddenly returned south in succession. A train of enemy troops arrives every ten minutes or so, so the order at each station along the way is extremely chaotic (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)

[Tianjin] Japan's attempt to attack Nankou, the hub of Beiping and Mongolia, has now proven to be a failure. The Japanese military headquarters issued an official report today, declaring that the attack on Nankou has fallen into stagnation. Moreover, due to continuous rain and floods, trenches and roads have all turned into rivers and channels, and the water is up to the soldiers' chests, so they are doing their best to defend against attacks by the Chinese army, fearing that it will be too late (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 21st)

[London] According to a telegram received here from Beiping, the war in North China is now developing to a new area. According to the Japanese army, the Chinese army is advancing sixty miles from Nankou towards Beiping and bombing the Japanese positions in Liangshan.

[Beiping] On the afternoon of the 21st, there were dense gunshots near Qinghe and Fengtai. It is reported that fierce battles broke out between Chinese guerrilla units and the Japanese army (Express News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### Locked Commentary

‚Äî Xiang

Mr. Green, the chief editor of the North China Daily News, said that Japan has placed itself in an unsustainable situation, where retreat would mean a loss of prestige, and advance is like wading through mud. How true these words are! I would say that it is like guessing fingers. If it indulges its emotions and disregards everything, it will only stop when it is completely drunk. We would not gamble with wine, but Japan gambles with its national destiny. What is the point? Although, is this what its people want?

Japanese warships, relying on the international fleet, bombarded our army with artillery. Therefore, when our military authorities issued the general attack order the day before yesterday, they notified the British and American consuls, requesting them to move their warships five nautical miles away, otherwise they would order the Japanese warships to move away, fearing damage to the warships of various countries. Unfortunately, the American flagship "Augusta" was hit by a Japanese stray bullet. The American newspaper said that in order to avoid desecrating the dignity of the newspaper, it is best not to comment on this behavior. These words have the style of Shaw and Bernard.

### Pinghan Front Line

‚Äî Ximin

The failure of this Pingjin battle is by no means a failure of combat, but can only be attributed to strategic and command errors. The high morale of the Twenty-Ninth Army brothers in resisting the enemy, and the magnificence of their spirit of sacrifice in advancing wave after wave, should not only move the compatriots of the whole country to tears of gratitude, but also naturally reveal a psychology of reverence in all people of conscience in the world. The battle for Lugouqiao was not recovered with airplanes and artillery, but with the Twenty-Ninth Army brothers using broadswords and grenades, disregarding their lives and rolling forward under the enemy's fierce machine gun fire, exchanging flesh and blood for it. Commander Li Wentian, who led the Thirty-Eighth Division in the bitter battle at Dazhigu, told reporters in person that during the anti-Japanese war in Tianjin, the brothers used their own flesh and blood to break through the enemy's barbed wire, and finally broke through the enemy's barbed wire and occupied the East Railway Station and part of the enemy's headquarters, Haiguang Temple, on top of layers of corpses of patriotic soldiers. Especially when the anti-Japanese war in Tianjin was launched, even the Italian army, a member of Japan's alliance, would allow our brothers to pass through the Italian Concession and raise their hands in salute. Would such loyal and brave soldiers lightly abandon our ancient capital of thousands of years, Tianjin, the only commercial port in North China, and retreat backward in three days?

After the Lugouqiao Incident on July 8, all the enlightened people in the country had already concluded that this was a planned act of aggression by the Japanese fascist military, and by no means an isolated incident. This observation was very correct. After the enemy provoked at Lugouqiao, her aggression was extremely planned. The first step was to use a policy of intimidation to try to subdue the local authorities in North China, but Mr. Feng Zhian's loyal and brave soldiers of the Thirty-Seventh Division answered the threats and conspiracies with continuous bitter battles. The enemy's first step policy was disappointed, so she used the second step of the division policy. At that time, the enemy thought that this division policy was successful. The enemy's newspapers once recognized Mr. Zhang Zizhong's troops of the Thirty-Eighth Division as pro-Japanese troops, and she concentrated all her attacks on the Thirty-Seventh Division. The enemy estimated that the division policy was in place, waiting for a sudden incident. When Mr. Song Zheyuan left Tianjin and returned to Peiping on the 19th of last month, a bomb was found on the railroad tracks near Beicang on the Beining Road. The fact is very obvious that the enemy was rehashing the old tune and playing the "Huanggutun" trick again. Fortunately, the enemy's technique was clumsy this time, and Mr. Song's affairs were safely passed, so the second step of the division policy, because of Mr. Song's return to Peiping, was not seen as a shortcut to victory. So the enemy's third step began her unceremonious annihilation tactics, trying to crush the combat power of our Twenty-Ninth Army in one fell swoop with intensive attacks of airplanes and artillery. From the bloody battle of the 38th Division's Liu Brigade in Langfang on July 16, the enemy began to use this final strategy. In the battle of Langfang, the enemy formally launched a large number of air force. In the bloody battle of the 27th and 28th regiments of Henanyuan, more than 30 enemy bombers bombed above our army barracks. Dozens of enemy field artillery pieces fired rapidly at our positions like beads. Tank cars and infantry were dispatched together. Nanyuan Huangsi Building, Xiyuan Wanping, were almost completely turned to ashes under the enemy's annihilation attack. The heroic soldiers, in the sound of enemy bombing, had their eardrums deafened and their eyes dazzled. They died and collapsed in hopeless struggles. Peiping, a cultural ancient city, was completely under the enemy's encirclement in less than two days. If the senior generals remaining in the city did not leave in a hurry at this time, there would only be one way to fight to the death on the battlefield and die with the city.

The highest local authorities in North China, with their wisdom and clarity, would never fail to recognize the enemy's insatiable ambition, but under their consistent principle of "bearing humiliation and taking responsibility," even when they hurriedly withdrew from Peiping, they were unwilling to sever the hope of a peaceful solution. It was precisely because the authorities excessively expected peace that they were subject to the enemy's restrictions everywhere. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the North China army could not quickly complete the combat deployment. The reinforcements on the Pinghan Line could only linger south of Baoding and could not advance. Even Changxindian, the only military stronghold in the rear defense of Wanping, was completely unprepared. Our local authorities, in order to eagerly hope for a peaceful solution and not to expand the situation, had their own difficulties in not urgently mobilizing, so as to avoid excessively stimulating the enemy. However, this fell into the enemy's conspiracy, allowing the enemy to defeat our army at various points. When the Langfang battle broke out and the situation around Peiping was at its worst, although the authorities ordered the concentration of military forces to prepare for resistance, the troops stationed in the Renqiu and Hejian areas advanced northward at the speed of forced marches. Unfortunately, the opportunity had already been missed and time did not allow it.

### Near Machang on the Jinpu Line, Our Army Advances Towards the Suburbs of Tianjin

Guerrilla Units are Densely Deployed Around Tianjin

[Tianjin] According to well-informed sources, there must be a large Chinese army stationed at Machang, about fifty miles from Tianjin. Some of them have advanced forward and are roughly closer to Tianjin. Or, a large army is advancing along the Baoding-Machang highway. It is reported that the Japanese side has sent troops along the Grand Canal to Machang to investigate the whereabouts of the Chinese army. The Japanese army is now preparing for air defense. It is heard that they will conduct an air defense exercise with live ammunition anti-aircraft guns in the southern and northern suburbs of Tianjin on the morning of the 21st. This is enough to prove that the Chinese air force has approached Tianjin. Yesterday, it rained heavily all night. The Japanese army used searchlights to shine into the low-lying clouds to prevent the Chinese air force from attacking. However, due to the bad weather, the exercise has been postponed to the 22nd. According to the same source, there is no doubt today that guerrilla units are densely deployed around Tianjin, and are constantly active in the suburbs, and harass Japanese sentry camps at night, causing rifle fire and light cannon fire to break out from time to time. The activities of the guerrilla units are either alone or in small groups, and the total number is difficult to estimate. As for whether these people are acting alone or are the vanguard of a large army, it is still unknown. The Chinese army has not yet shown any signs of launching a frontal attack, because in the past few weeks, there has been frequent heavy rain, and many highways have been washed away, making marching difficult. Therefore, no major battles will occur near Tianjin until after the weather clears. It is heard that the Japanese side is currently stationing a large army in Tianjin, and is currently rushing to build barracks to accommodate the large army. However, its strength is difficult to guess. At the same time, the Belgian consul in Tianjin is registering foreigners outside the consular jurisdiction. Presumably, its purpose is to calculate the food needed in an emergency, or to allow these people to leave Tianjin. If they leave Tianjin, Beidaihe will probably be used as a reception center (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st).

### Our Army Recaptures Pingli

[Baoding] On the 21st, our army drove away the enemy from the Pingli area in Fangshan County and recaptured the area. It is now confronting the enemy north of Pingli (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st).

[Nanjing] News from the transportation sector: The railway near Liangwangzhuang on the Jinpu Line was destroyed by our civilian army some time ago. At that time, two enemy armored trains were intercepted and approximately one hundred enemy soldiers were killed. Afterwards, the enemy urgently sent heavy troops to cover and repair the tracks. The intercepted armored trains were able to transport the enemy corpses back to Tianjin (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st).

### Our Army Encircles Zhangbei

[Guihua] More than a thousand Japanese troops stubbornly occupy Zhangbei. Our infantry and cavalry units have tightly encircled Zhangbei and are about to launch a general attack. It is expected that it will be captured soon (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st).

[Baoding] From the 20th to the 21st, the enemy in the Zhangbei area, with most of its forces and more than 20 heavy artillery pieces, under the cover of more than 30 airplanes, launched a fierce attack on our Monkey Mountain position. Our army fought back, and the bloody battle was extremely fierce (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st).

### Only by Recognizing China's Equal Treatment Can Peace in the Far East be Maintained

Japanese Politicians Should Awaken Early; Insightful Views from a Former Counselor of the British Embassy

[London] The Times of London published an article today by Sir Deric Tilman, former counselor of the British Embassy in Peiping, saying that the interests of Britain and the United States in China are the same. Both countries are always committed to promoting the establishment of a strong and stable government in China to rule the united Chinese people. Japan is different from this, and always provokes local incidents and negotiates with regional authorities. Its actions are actually violating the entire principle of China's unified and stable government. Therefore, the policies of Britain and the United States are becoming increasingly distant from the policies of Japan year by year. However, Japan must trade with China, and its prosperity depends on China's wealth. The Duke concluded that, for those who sincerely hope for the common prosperity of the two countries, we now earnestly hope that Japanese politicians can awaken early. It is really uncertain whether Japan can subdue the Chinese people by force. Now, only by recognizing the demands of the new China for equal treatment can peace be preserved (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd).

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the newspapers regarding the Shanghai war, roughly stating that all American merchant ships in the Far East are sufficient to evacuate American expatriates from Shanghai when necessary. Therefore, so far, he has not ordered any domestic warships to participate in the matter. Regarding the incident of the American Asian Fleet flagship "Augusta," Hull said that the matter would not lead to any developments (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd).

### Ministry of Finance Replies to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the Method of Paying Taxes by Check

The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is hereby informed that the Hubei Provincial Government has sent a telegram stating that it is inconvenient to refuse the acceptance of checks for tax payment by merchants in this province, and proposes to make a change. All tax collection agencies that receive checks, regardless of the amount, are allowed to take them to the bank for encashment in order to take both into account." It is found that the revenue and expenditure of taxes should be changed. All merchants who pay taxes by check and tax collection agencies that remit taxes by check shall not be restricted by Article 1 of the Measures for Stabilizing Finance. However, in order to prevent the flow of money, these withdrawals should still fill out an application form in accordance with the format issued by the Ministry and send it to the audit committee composed of branches of the four banks, Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, in the local area for review and certification. In places where there is no audit committee, the withdrawer must submit supporting documents before withdrawing. In addition to telegraphed replies and branches, it is necessary to order the subordinate to follow suit, the Ministry of Finance, Haoqianyin."

### The New Asia Hotel Was Not Occupied by the Enemy

Yesterday, there was a false rumor that the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road had been occupied by the Japanese army. In reality, at 3:00 PM on the 20th, a unit of the Japanese army wanted to investigate whether there were any Chinese plainclothes soldiers inside the hotel. The Indian guard of the hotel stated that permission from the police station was required before they could enter. Later, the Japanese army found a senior official from the police station, who together conducted an inspection and found no trace of Chinese plainclothes soldiers. The Japanese troops then withdrew immediately. There were no Japanese troops setting up anti-aircraft guns or anything of the sort.

### Hundreds of Prisoners Released on Parole from Caoh√©jing Prison

After the outbreak of the war, the local court was located in a military zone. Therefore, those in detention centers who had been sentenced or were awaiting trial for terms of ten years or less were ordered to be released on bail or parole. As a result, more than 600 people were released. Only 32 serious offenders remained. It is now learned that the Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing has also been ordered in the past two days to grant parole to all prisoners sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of five years or less, numbering several hundred as well.

### Public Concession Authorities Tighten Defense in Northern District

To Prevent Defeated Enemy Soldiers from Fleeing Westward

The Public Concession authorities consider the current defense of the northern district, from the Water Works Bridge northward along North Jiangxi Road to Fusheng Road on the Chinese territory, to be the most critical. This is because the area is only Bai Wu (a measurement of distance) away from North Sichuan Road. In order to prevent defeated enemy soldiers from fleeing westward from North Sichuan Road, Bazilu (Target Road), and other places, the east-west traffic on this line has been completely blocked. In addition to stationing substantial forces and powerful weapons along the line, the Huizi (a corruption of the English word "police") police station in charge has also dispatched additional Chinese, Western, and Indian police officers to patrol closely. Furthermore, due to the escape of defeated enemy soldiers from the intersection of Baoshan Road and North Henan Road yesterday, precautions are also being taken today. Based on the current strength of the defenses, it is believed that Japanese soldiers will definitely not be able to retreat to the area under the jurisdiction of the Huizi police station.

### Floating Corpses Discovered in Suzhou Creek

Their Appearance Resembles Villagers; Likely Victims of the Enemy

In recent days, male and female corpses have been found in Suzhou Creek, in numbers ranging from three to five. Most are only dressed in short shirts and trousers, and many are barefoot or bare-chested. Their appearance closely resembles villagers. According to general speculation, these male and female corpses must be residents of the Yangshupu area who were unable to escape after the outbreak of the war, were brutally killed by enemy soldiers, and then thrown into the Huangpu River. Therefore, they drifted with the current and were carried by the tide into Suzhou Creek.
