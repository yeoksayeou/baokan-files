### Fierce Fighting at Xiaguan Station, Capital Still Held; Intense Street Battles in Parts of the Southern City; Multiple Japanese Warships Move Upstream to Assist the Attack

[Tokyo] According to a Nanjing dispatch received by newspapers, the Japanese army is currently advancing southward along Xiaguan Avenue, so the Nanjing garrison may be surrounded on all sides, and its annihilation is only a matter of time. The Japanese army also claims to have occupied Pukou on Sunday night, so the retreat of the Nanjing garrison has been cut off. (Reuters, 13th)

[Tokyo] According to telegrams received here, the Japanese army attacking Nanjing has advanced to the East Gate (referring to Zhongshan Gate) at dawn today and occupied part of the southern city within a few hours. It further states that the Xiaguan Station, the terminus of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, is currently undergoing fierce battles. Several Japanese warships have moved upstream along the Yangtze River to assist in the attack on the capital. Japanese sources admit that Zijin Mountain is still in the hands of the Chinese army, and the Chinese resistance is extremely strong. (National Maritime News Agency, 13th)

[Hankou] No confirmation has been received here of the Japanese claim that Pukou has been occupied. Chinese sources say that Japanese reports are highly suspicious. (Reuters, 13th)

### Our Main Force Has Already Been Concentrated

[Hankou] Today, someone asked the Chinese military authorities here whether it was a wise military strategy to concentrate a large number of elite Chinese troops to defend the capital. The answer was that the brave defense of Nanjing by the Chinese army can greatly boost the morale and optimism of the entire Chinese army. This sacrifice also has other purposes. Politically, the Chinese army cannot but make a difficult struggle and abandon the capital. Strategically, the Japanese army must suffer heavy losses in order to capture Nanjing's solid fortifications. However, only a small part of the elite Chinese troops are currently fighting in Nanjing. The main force of the Chinese army has been concentrated at the junction of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces and the north bank of the Yangtze River. Furthermore, the organization of the reserve army has been completed. The equipment and armaments of this army are even more complete and modern than the best-equipped Chinese troops currently. According to a senior Chinese official who met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Kai-shek is in very good health and spirit. Not long ago, all sectors of the Chinese community were pessimistic, but now they are completely different and have returned to optimism. (Reuters, 13th)

### Our Troops Defend to the Death with Fortifications

[Hankou] According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army attacking Nanjing has not made the expected progress due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army. As of the evening of the 12th, the entire city was still held by the Chinese army. From dawn on the 12th, the Japanese army again targeted the city with its dense heavy artillery bombardment. Japanese aircraft were also very active, bombing fiercely, with bombs raining down, causing fires to break out in civilian houses everywhere. Many bombs also hit refugee areas, and countless innocent people were tragically bombed to death. (National Maritime News Agency, 13th)

[Hong Kong] According to reliable sources here, the Chinese army defending Nanjing is only using a few regiments as rear guards to cover the gradual withdrawal of fresh troops, while at the same time doing its best to stop the Japanese army from advancing. This strategy of preserving the main force is in accordance with the pre-determined plan of the headquarters. The high morale and effective resistance shown by the Nanjing garrison in recent days has left an unusually deep impression here, and it is believed that rumors that the morale of the Chinese army has been affected are self-defeating. (National Maritime News Agency, 13th)

### Heavy Losses in the Safety Zone

[Hankou] According to a telegram received here this afternoon, Nanjing is indeed still firmly held by the Chinese army. This morning, telephone and telegraph communications between Nanjing and Hankou were interrupted for several hours, leading to rumors of the capital's fall. By noon, traffic had been completely restored. According to reports from Nanjing this afternoon, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack at dawn today, and the air force bombing was particularly active, with bombs raining down densely, shaking the entire city's buildings. According to Chinese official sources, as of now, the Japanese army has not gained a foothold in Nanjing city. All attacks have been repelled. The reason for the traffic obstruction between Nanjing and Hankou this morning was that the Nanjing radio station was bombed. Fortunately, the damage was light and was repaired by noon. Many bombs also fell in the safety zone, and the material losses are said to be extremely heavy, but the number of casualties has not yet been ascertained. The safety zone occupies an area of about two kilometers long and one kilometer wide, and is crowded with about 100,000 refugees, so the extent of the damage is extremely severe. (National Maritime News Agency, 12th)

### Japanese Sources: Fierce Street Battles

According to Domei News Agency, the Japanese troops of Iza and Fujii, under the support of the engineering corps, crossed the small river outside Zhongshan Gate by iron boats before dawn this morning. At 5 a.m., they broke into the city from the breach in the city wall and advanced along Zhongshan Road towards Ming Palace. At the same time, the troops of Sakakita, Jinbei, Hasegawa, and Okamoto from Zhonghua Gate entered the city from the south, and fierce street battles broke out in the southeastern part of Nanjing city. At 6 a.m., the Fujii troops occupied Zhongshan Gate, and the Sakakita and Jinbei troops occupied the city wall between Zhongshan Gate and Guanghua Gate. At about 8 a.m., the Japanese artillery outside Zhongshan Gate began shelling the city to assist infantry operations. The troops entering the city clashed with the Chinese army everywhere and launched fierce street battles. By 10 a.m., the fighting was most intense. Around noon, the troops of Takeshita and Okamoto broke through the Shuixi Gate in the southwest corner and entered the city, thus expanding the area of street battles. The Katagiri troops on the western heights of Zijin Mountain echoed the battle at Zhongshan Gate and advanced to the west of Ming Xiaoling. At the same time, the Asukawa troops, detouring north along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, drove straight into Xiaguan to control the north. A part of the Asukawa and Noda troops occupied the Astronomical Observatory in the western part of Zijin Mountain at about 10 a.m. and attacked Taiping Gate. (Domei News Agency, 13th)

### Japanese Casualties Heavier Than Ours

[Hankou] A senior Chinese government official met with a representative of the National Maritime News Agency this morning and guaranteed that the claim that Nanjing was about to fall was absolutely unfounded. He emphasized that as of now, not a single Japanese soldier had invaded the inner city. According to the latest official report released by the military authorities, the Chinese troops defending Nanjing were extremely well-organized. The Japanese troops attacking the city gates not only failed to break through the defense lines, but also suffered extremely heavy casualties, far greater than the losses of the Chinese army, because the Chinese army relied on solid trenches and sandbags for cover. The official report continued that the Chinese army used bombers to assist in the defense of the capital, and as a result, the Japanese army's supply depots in the suburbs were greatly damaged. As of this morning, the Japanese army had not gained an inch of land inside the city gates. The two sides fought fiercely in close combat in the morning, but the Japanese army was repelled. The official report continued that the highest peak of Zijin Mountain was still firmly held by the Chinese army, and the artillery continued to bombard the Japanese army digging trenches. The Japanese artillery not only lost its effectiveness, but also had no way to retreat. (National Maritime News Agency, 13th)

### Eleven Divisions Defending the City

[Hankou] According to a spokesman for the Chinese government, the officialdom received a long-distance telephone call from Nanjing last night, stating that although the Japanese army was desperately attacking the city, they had not succeeded in the end. Nanjing is still held by the Chinese army. Although the Chinese army's sacrifices were heroic, the Japanese army's casualties were also extremely heavy. Fierce fighting is taking place near Guanghua Gate. Chinese bombers are providing assistance to the defending troops and are an important factor in stopping the Japanese army from advancing. The Japanese army launched the fiercest attack on the Heping Gate position, but the Chinese army has consolidated its defense line. A telegram from Chinese officialdom received here today stated that the troops defending Nanjing totaled about eleven divisions. Chinese aircraft have flown to Nanjing twice to assist the defending troops in resisting the enemy. It is heard that more aircraft will be dispatched to assist in the battle within the day. The Japanese claim that the Japanese army occupied Zijin Mountain is actually untrue, because the Japanese army only occupied a small peak of the mountain. All the main peaks, including Jiangshan and Zhongshan, are still in the hands of the Chinese army. It is heard that General Tang Shengzhi has earned the nickname "Capital Madman." The general is nearly fifty years old and participated in the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army. He recently became seriously ill. When the Japanese army attacked from western Shanghai, the general was ordered to defend the capital. The general must inspect the entire city from the mountain peak every morning. Any houses that obstruct his view are ordered to be burned. Gong Debai, a reporter for the Save the Nation Daily, has been appointed as the execution director. Gong is a Japanese student and is extremely anti-Japanese. He recently wrote a book entitled "Defeat Japan." (Reuters, 13th)

### British Warships and Merchant Ships Bombed; Strong Protest to Japan Planned

Foreign Minister Hirota Expresses Regret to British Ambassador Yesterday

[Hankou] After the British warship and merchant ship in Wuhu were bombarded by the Japanese field artillery and machine guns yesterday morning, British Consul Byron, Military Attaché of the British Embassy Fraser, and Flag Officer Wharton of the British warship landed and protested to Colonel Hashimoto, the highest Japanese military officer in the Wuhu area. Colonel Hashimoto replied that he had ordered the bombardment of ships in the Yangtze River, but admitted that the bombardment of the British warships Bee and Ladybird was a mistake. British Consul Byron and others arrived in Wuhu at 7:30 a.m. yesterday on the tugboat Jin Da (transliteration) of the British trading company Xiangtai Timber Company, and then boarded the British warship Ladybird, which was docked a short distance upstream of Wuhu. Japanese troops on the shore immediately fired machine guns at Jin Da. The tugboat immediately sailed downstream, and the Japanese troops continued firing until the ship was out of range. The Ladybird then began to drop anchor in order to approach the shore to protest to the Japanese authorities, but at this time, the Japanese field artillery, clearly visible on the shore, suddenly opened fire on the ships parked upstream of the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil depot, continuing until the Ladybird was docked next to the Wuhu Public Hospital. A total of four shells hit the ship, killing one sailor and seriously injuring another. Flag Officer Wharton was also among those slightly injured. Jardine Matheson's Ruihe Wheel was also hit by a shell. Since the company's Dehe and its barge were destroyed by Japanese aircraft on December 5, the Ruihe has been used as a replacement barge, and was parked behind the Ladybird at the time. An hour after the bombardment stopped, the British gunboat Bee arrived in Wuhu and was also bombarded by Japanese field artillery. At one point, it was only 400 yards from the shore, but it was not hit. The extent of the damage to the Ruihe Wheel is not yet known. (Reuters, 13th)

[Hankou] According to information received here, British gunboats and merchant ships in Nanjing were repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft and machine guns yesterday. The first attack was at 1:30 p.m., when three Japanese aircraft dropped eight bombs, bombing the British gunboats Cricket and Scarab. Both ships returned fire with Lewis machine guns. The Japanese aircraft then bombed British ships parked two miles upstream of Xiaguan, dropping several bombs that landed next to the two ships, narrowly missing them. The British gunboats Cricket and Scarab then reopened fire to attack the Japanese aircraft, and another squadron of Japanese aircraft came to attack the British gunboats, dropping six medium-weight bombs, but none hit. The British gunboats then used three-inch guns, firing many shells, and the Japanese aircraft then flew away. An hour later, the parked British ships were bombed by Japanese aircraft for the second time, and the British gunboats again used three-inch guns to defend them. None of the British gunboats and merchant ships were hit by the bombs. At dusk, three more Japanese aircraft launched a third attack on the British merchant ships, dropping eight bombs. The two British gunboats still used three-inch guns and Lewis machine guns to drive them away. After the first attack by the Japanese aircraft, Major Ashworth, the senior British naval officer stationed in Nanjing on the British gunboat Cricket, questioned the Japanese authorities and requested the senior British naval officer stationed in Shanghai, Captain Dundas of the British cruiser Folkestone, to protest to Japanese Fleet Commander Hasegawa as soon as possible, and to ensure the safety of British ships. At the same time, the British authorities issued orders to all British gunboats to fire back when they are actually attacked by aircraft. (Reuters, 13th)

[Hankou] The British gunboat Bee has now sailed out of Wuhu to assist the survivors of the American gunboat Panay. There are concerns that the Bee may also be attacked en route, as Japanese commander Hashimoto of Wuhu has notified the British authorities that no ships may move on the Yangtze River for the next three days. Hashimoto said that if Japanese orders are not followed, they will be bombarded. Hashimoto admitted that he is currently not in contact with his headquarters and that his troops cannot recognize the British flag. The Taikoo Tugboat Zhu Long (transliteration) was alarmed for fifteen minutes last night when it docked alongside the British ship Bee at the Taikoo lower wharf. Although the Japanese troops did not bombard it, the shore artillery was aimed at it. The staff of the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies in Wuhu have now boarded the Bee and Ladybird. British Consul Byron of Nanjing and Military Attaché Fraser of the British Embassy are also stationed on the Bee and are probably accompanying it to assist the survivors of the Panay. (Reuters, 12th)

[Hankou] Japanese Commander-in-Chief Hasegawa of the China Sea Fleet has assured the British authorities in Nanjing and Wuhu that he will do his best to respect the locations where ships are concentrated in the Nanjing area, within his power. The concentrated ships include the British ships Cricket, Scarab, Taikoo's Huangpu, Wantong, and Haiguang, and Jardine Matheson's barge, three tugboats, and two lightships. In addition, there are two ships from the Asiatic Petroleum Company, two British merchant ships, and several other foreign merchant ships. (Reuters, 13th)

### Emergency Meeting of British Cabinet

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain held an emergency meeting with key cabinet members today to discuss the recent Japanese bombing of British warships and merchant ships. The Prime Minister and cabinet members first consulted by telephone, and then met with Foreign Secretary Eden for a long time, drafting a statement to be read to the House of Commons this afternoon. It is understood that Britain will lodge a strong protest with Japan, demanding compensation, a formal apology, and punishment of the perpetrators, but will not issue an ultimatum to Japan. However, most members of Parliament are very indignant. (National Telegraph)

[London] The atmosphere in the British House of Commons today was extremely serious. After being questioned by members of Parliament, British Foreign Secretary Eden stood up and made a statement regarding the recent accident in the Far East, saying that the seriousness of the attack on British ships in the Yangtze River at the end of last week goes without saying. (Applause) However, given the magnitude of the issues involved, he hoped that the House would not ask him to make a more detailed statement today. Labor Party leader Attlee then asked whether the Foreign Secretary had received news of similar attacks on American ships, and whether he had consulted with the US government on these repeated attacks. Eden replied that an American gunboat had also been attacked and had unfortunately sunk, with casualties. He also said that the British and American governments are currently engaged in consultations. (Reuters, 13th)

### British Officialdom Greatly Surprised

[London] British officialdom was very surprised and displeased to hear that British warships and merchant ships in Wuhu, China, were bombarded by Japanese artillery. However, as of now, the Foreign Office has only received a rather brief report from the British authorities in Wuhu, and officialdom has therefore refused to express any views on how the government intends to respond. Well-informed sources say that the government intends to lodge a protest with Japan. (Havas, 12th)

### British Ambassador to Japan Asks Japan to Pay Attention

[Tokyo] British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Clive went to the Japanese Foreign Ministry at 10:30 this morning to ask the Japanese government to pay attention to the serious nature of the accidental shooting of British warships and merchant ships by the Japanese army in Wuhu yesterday. A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry told Reuters reporters this morning that they had just received news that a Japanese military officer had rushed from Shanghai to Wuhu to investigate the matter. At the same time, the spokesman declined to comment on the matter, saying that he had not yet received a detailed report. (Reuters, 13th)

### Foreign Minister Hirota Expresses Deep Regret

[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota visited British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie today and expressed his deep regret on behalf of the Japanese government for the unfortunate incident in which the British ship Cricket was hit four times by Japanese field artillery in Wuhu yesterday. Japanese Army Minister Sugiyama also sent his personal representative to visit the military attaché of the British Embassy this afternoon to express his regret for the Wuhu accident and asked the military attaché to inform the British Ambassador that he had personally investigated the matter. At the same time, all Japanese newspapers did not publish reports of the bombing and shooting of British warships and merchant ships. (Reuters, 13th)

### Pessimism Caused in London

[London] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said today that the Japanese bombardment of British warships in the Yangtze River has caused a sad impression in London. The political circles are currently only verifying this news and are awaiting the arrival of detailed reports. Once the detailed reports are received, they will begin to study them closely. (Reuters, 13th)

### London Newspapers Publish in Large Print

[London] This morning, all newspapers published in large print the news of the Japanese army bombarding British gunboats and merchant ships in the Yangtze River. The Daily Telegraph editorial was titled "Madness in the Yangtze River," saying that among the events that have occurred in the Far East in recent months, none is more likely to arouse anti-Japanese sentiment among the British people than yesterday's atrocities in the Yangtze River, which are even more infuriating than the shooting of British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. Although the matter is serious, the British people still want a more detailed investigation before they can believe that it was an intentional insult. After translating and recounting the Japanese anti-British behavior, the newspaper said that this was probably not the responsible behavior of the Japanese government, and the only slightly comforting assumption is that the Japanese commanders in various places in the Yangtze River were panicked and went crazy. It is hoped that the Japanese government will make appropriate corrections. The Daily Mail also had an editorial, with more direct wording, saying that the Japanese army's attacks came and went, and it happened again and again, which cannot be regarded as a mistake. However, in any case, we must make the invaders pay the price for their actions. (Reuters, 13th)

[London] The British press is commenting on the shelling of British warships and merchantmen by Japanese forces on the Yangtze River at Wuhu, China. The Conservative Daily Telegraph writes: "This act of insolence is likely to be intentional. How the truth is to be thoroughly investigated. The only forgiving word that can be uttered at this time is that the Japanese commanders have acted improperly, and that this unfortunate incident has occurred. However, this is not the glory of the Japanese army. According to news coming from Tokyo in recent days, enlightened people in Japan have been controlled by the warmongering factions of the army and navy who are eager to fight a quick battle. These people are impatient because the Chinese army is fighting so fiercely." The Liberal News Chronicle writes: "We should tell the Japanese authorities in serious terms that the British nation's patience has a certain limit and should demand compensation from Japan, while also ordering them to restrain their barbaric soldiers." (Havas, 13th)

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangdong-Hankou Railways

Luoyang and Nanchang Also Bombed

### American Gunboat Panay Sunk by Japanese Aircraft in Nanking

Rumor of 23 Dead; Five Socony Oil Tankers Also Sunk - Japanese Navy Claims Japanese Aircraft Mistook Target - Bombing of Socony Tankers Led to Damage to American Warship

[Hankow] At 9:30 this morning, American Ambassador to China, Mr. Johnson, received a telephone call from American missionary Dana in Anqing, reporting that the American gunboat Panay was sunk by Japanese aircraft yesterday near Wuhu. It is said that he was informed of this by Mr. Atcheson of the American Embassy, who was residing in Hexian, Anhui Province at the time. Mr. Atcheson reported that there were 54 survivors, most of whom went to Hexian. It is not yet known whether five Socony oil tankers docked near the Panay were also involved. In addition to the sailors on board, the Panay also carried four American Embassy officials (who left Nanjing at the last moment), five other Americans, one Englishman, and three Italians. Fifteen survivors were injured, including one Italian, and several were seriously injured. Aside from the American gunboat Bee, which sailed from Wuhu to Hexian to assist the Panay survivors, the American gunboat Oahu also went from Jiujiang to Wuhu to transport the survivors upstream. Yesterday at 1:30 PM, the Panay was sending a wireless message when it was received by the American gunboat Luzon here, but the message suddenly broke off, presumably at the time of the bombing. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

The English-language North China Daily News reported that this morning (the 13th), the American cruiser Augusta, docked in the Huangpu River, received a delayed message stating that the American gunboat Panay of the Yangtze River patrol fleet was sunk yesterday afternoon by Japanese aircraft bombs in the Yangtze River outside Hexian, Anhui Province, about 25 miles upstream from Nanjing. In addition, several Socony oil tankers were also sunk. There were 54 survivors, several of whom were injured and have landed in Hexian. The initial message was sent by telephone from Anqing to Shanghai by Mr. Atcheson, Second Secretary of the American Embassy. At the time of the North China Daily News going to press, it was only known that the captain of the Panay, Hughes, was also among the survivors. According to unverified unofficial sources, as of noon today, there were a total of 19 deaths. Whether they were sailors or passengers is currently unknown. The British gunboat Bee, upon hearing the alarm, immediately sailed downstream to transport the survivors to Wuhu, but it is expected that they have all gone to Anqing. The American gunboat Oahu is also currently en route from Jiujiang to Wuhu. It is verified that the Panay carried a total of fifty to sixty people, including five officers, four American Embassy officials among the Americans, several journalists and businessmen. It is now believed that there were no missionaries on board. Among the well-known Americans, it is said that there were Mr. Ahle of the World Newsreel, Mr. Merville of Fox Movietone News, Mr. James of the Associated Press, Mr. Norman Alley of The New York Times (a naturalized Chinese-American), Mr. Marshall of Collier's magazine, Mr. Stryker of Jardine Matheson & Co., Mr. Broderick of Socony Oil, and Mr. Patterson of China Aircraft Parts Company. In addition, there were also Mr. Macdonald of the London Times and two Italian journalists. It is now believed that the Panay was sunk by Japanese aircraft yesterday afternoon. Yesterday afternoon, when the Panay was communicating by wireless with the American naval authorities in Shanghai, the connection was suddenly interrupted. It is not yet determined whether this was due to a generator malfunction or bombing. It is not known how many Japanese aircraft participated in the bombing, how many bombs were dropped, how many hit, or whether the ship fired back. According to reports, three Socony oil tankers that were docked near the Panay a day or two ago for protection were bombed. It is not yet known whether they were sunk. Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Major General Harada flew to Wuhu this morning, apparently to seek a solution to the case and negotiate with the American authorities regarding the Japanese aircraft bombing the American warship. It is reported that Japanese army aircraft were ordered to bomb any ships in the Yangtze River, while naval aircraft were ordered to exercise caution. Japanese army authorities urged foreign ships in the Yangtze River to dock outside the Nanjing-Wuhu war zone, as the Chinese army is currently using the Yangtze River as its only route of retreat. Japanese military authorities declared that neutral ships should dock outside the war zone, and if they need to anchor, they should do so at a location away from the Chinese military transport lines. The Panay left Nanjing on Saturday afternoon due to the intense artillery fire in Nanjing and the risk of bombing in Xiaguan.

[Hankow] According to news received here this morning, the American gunboat "Panay" of the American Yangtze River Fleet, along with several Socony oil tankers in Wuhu, were sunk by Japanese aircraft at 2:30 PM on the 12th in the Jiangmian area near Hexian County, Anhui Province, upstream from Nanjing. The number of casualties that have been verified is 23. When the ship left Nanjing, it carried four staff members of the American Embassy in Nanjing, several journalists, and Mr. Macdonald, a reporter for the London Times. (Express News Agency dispatch, 13th)

[Hankow] The American Embassy here has learned that the American gunboat Panay carried a total of 76 people, including 56 crew members, 4 American Embassy officials, and 6 Chinese people. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Kawagoe and Okamoto Express Regret

Shanghai, 13th (Domei News Agency) - Consul General Okamoto visited American Consul General Gauss at 11:00 this morning to express his deep regret regarding the Japanese aircraft sinking the American warship. Ambassador Kawagoe also sent a lengthy telegram to American Ambassador Johnson in Hankow, expressing his regret.

### Japanese Commander Hasegawa Takes Responsibility

The Japanese Navy communique issued at noon yesterday announced that the Japanese authorities will take appropriate steps to ensure that Vice Admiral Hasegawa, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, takes full responsibility for the sinking of the American gunboat Panay by Japanese aircraft. It stated that the sinking of the American warship was a most unfortunate incident, and the Japanese naval authorities sincerely expressed their deepest apologies. The communique stated that Japanese naval aircraft, because the Chinese army was fleeing Nanjing, flew out on the night of December 11 to pursue them. They mistook three Socony oil tankers for Chinese ships and dropped bombs on them. During this time, a most unfortunate incident occurred, namely that an American warship docked near the three ships was hit and sunk. The Japanese authorities sincerely express their deepest apologies for this matter. Vice Admiral Hasegawa will take appropriate steps to take full responsibility. Shanghai, 13th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese naval authorities issued a statement today stating that the naval authorities received a report on the evening of the 11th that the Chinese army was leaving Nanjing by ship to head upstream, and immediately dispatched an air squadron to pursue them. However, the squadron mistook three Socony oil tankers for Chinese ships and bombed them, resulting in the sinking of an American warship nearby. The occurrence of such an unfortunate incident is regrettable for the American Navy. Commander-in-Chief Hasegawa should take appropriate measures to take full responsibility for this incident.

### US Department of State Releases Report

[Washington] The Department of State today released a report from American Ambassador to China, Johnson, in Hankow, regarding the sinking of the American warship Panay. Johnson's report was very brief, stating that the Panay's radio went silent at 1:30 PM on the 12th, when it was anchored 29 miles upstream from Nanjing. In addition to the crew, there were four American Embassy personnel and five American expatriates on board. In addition, there were probably one British expatriate and three Italian expatriates. At 9:30 AM on the 13th, Johnson received a telephone call from missionary Cutler in Anqing, who relayed a telephone message from Mr. Atcheson of the embassy, notifying that the Panay had been sunk and that 54 people on board had managed to escape, but 15 were injured to varying degrees, including one Italian expatriate. Five Socony oil tankers were next to the ship and were also sunk at the time. Atcheson was in Hexian, Anhui, and it is likely that the other survivors were also there. Currently, the British warship Bee has sailed from Wuhu to Hexian to rescue the survivors. The American warship Oahu has also departed from Jiujiang to Wuhu to welcome the people to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull went to bed last night without waiting for a detailed report on the sinking of the American warship Panay by the Japanese army in the Yangtze River, so he did not draft any necessary protest notes. It is clearly evident that the State Department is now trying to calm the reaction of the American people. The Washington Post's comments can represent the State Department's views, saying that the United States does not have any relationship that would drag us into the war, our fundamental policy is to avoid war, and we are not adequately prepared to fight and protect the lives of Americans in the Far East at the same time. People here believe that if a large ship like the Lusitania had been sunk instead of a gunboat, American public outrage might have been aroused by the truth of the situation. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### American Congressmen Express Opinions

[Washington] Several congressmen, due to the sinking of the American warship Panay by Japanese aircraft, reiterated to Associated Press reporters today that American warships should withdraw from the Yangtze River basin. Republican Congressman Fish said that if the United States insists on stationing ten gunboats in China, such incidents will happen sooner or later. Japan has already controlled traffic on the Yangtze River in Shanghai and Nanjing, and American warships should have withdrawn long ago. No matter what the losses are now, it is still advisable to withdraw all American warships from the war zone. However, the American people should still deal with it with a cool head. Democratic Congressman Maverick said that the United States should determine its policy towards the Far East as soon as possible, with the best being strict neutrality, because it is better for Americans not to interfere in others' affairs. However, Democratic Senator Connally firmly advocated that the United States should immediately demand an apology from Japan and compensate for all losses. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)

[Washington] The Navy and State Departments have begun investigating the truth about the sinking of the American warship Panay today. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy said that a full report may be released to the press on Monday. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)

### Hirota Apologizes to American Ambassador Yesterday

[Tokyo] At 10:00 this morning, American Ambassador to Japan Grew visited Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, saying that he had just received a report that Japanese shells had landed near the American gunboat Panay in Nanjing, and that the Japanese authorities would handle the matter carefully. Shortly after, Hirota received information from the Ministry of the Navy that Japanese aircraft had destroyed several Socony oil tankers and sunk the American warship Panay, and immediately visited the American ambassador to apologize. Both the Army and Navy also met with the naval and military attaches of the American Embassy on this matter. This unexpected incident has caused deep concern in Japanese official circles, as they very much desire friendly relations between Japan and the United States in order to prevent cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East incident. Japanese newspapers, in addition to publishing vaguely worded communiques, have not released information about the Japanese aircraft bombing the American warship and Socony oil tankers.

### Britain and the United States Discuss Closely

[London] It was learned from the British side today that Britain and the United States have discussed taking appropriate measures regarding the Japanese military attacking the warships and merchant ships of the two countries in the Yangtze River. It is heard that this discussion is progressing simultaneously in London and Washington, and the ambassadors of Britain and the United States to China and Japan are also closely exchanging reports, but they will not take joint action. What is being discussed is only taking individual actions. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)

### American Action May Not Be Hasty

[Washington] If the sinking of the American gunboat Panay is indeed the responsibility of the Japanese, the American government, after clarifying the situation, will send a note to Tokyo with extremely stern wording. However, judging from the attitude of the government and congressional leaders when they received the report of the sinking of the American warship, the United States may not take hasty action. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### American Newspapers Greatly Shocked

[Washington] The news of the American gunboat "Panay" being sunk by Japanese aircraft arrived late at night, and the newspapers were greatly shocked, all issuing extra editions and rushing to publish it. Secretary of State Hull also issued a statement saying that detailed information would be received tomorrow, and it was not convenient to comment at this time. Semi-official sources said that the "Panay" was necessary to be stationed near Nanjing in order to protect American expatriates, and the Yangtze River had been blockaded by the Chinese army, so it was impossible for the ship to sail to Shanghai. Political figures such as New York State Republican Congressman Fish will demand that the government order American warships to leave the vicinity of Nanjing as soon as possible to avoid accidents, but most members of the Senate and House of Representatives, when answering reporters' questions, said that the American government should deal with Japan with a tough attitude.

### Japanese Army Invasion of Jingjiang Repelled

Over 200 Japanese Soldiers Killed Landing; Two Japanese Boats Sunk at Zhang Huanggang; Jiangyin Blockade Line Remains Intact

Nantong Communication: Since the fall of Jiangyin, the Japanese side has poured in army, navy, and air forces to attack Jingjiang on the north bank of the Yangtze River. On the evening of the 8th, it was once invaded, but was still bravely repelled by our garrison. Because the Jingjiang telephone is no longer working, the local area is in a state of panic. At the same time, Japanese warships also spied on Zhang Huanggang at the junction of Rugao and Jingjiang counties. Our garrison used artillery to sink two Japanese motorboats and machine-gunned the Japanese army near the shore, killing more than 200 people. Currently, Nantong, Rugao, and Jingjiang are as peaceful as usual. Ge Tan, Commissioner and Security Commander of the Fourth District, made a special trip to Rugao and Jingjiang to inspect, and returned to Nantong on the morning of the 10th. The telephone from Tongcheng to Zhang Huanggang is currently open to Shizhuang, which is peaceful. As for the Jiangyin blockade line, although it has been damaged by the Japanese side for several days, it remains intact. (10th)

### Kong Xiangxi's Important Speech

China Is Ready to Accept Honorable Peace; Otherwise, Regardless of Victory or Defeat, It Will Resist to the End

[Hankow] A reporter interviewed Mr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, today. Mr. Kong stated that China is prepared to accept an honorable peace that respects China's territorial and administrative integrity at any time. He also said that whether Japan can cease hostilities after capturing Nanjing is a matter for the Japanese side. As for China's current war effort, it is not only to seek the survival of the nation, but also to strive for world peace, so regardless of victory or defeat, China will definitely resolutely resist to the end. But if Japan can respect China's territorial and administrative integrity, peace can be achieved immediately. The reporter then asked Mr. Kong, "Can the central government accept a peace agreement based on the autonomy of North China?" Mr. Kong replied, "If North China is separated from the Chinese territory, then China's sovereignty will naturally be undermined. If this can be accepted, then what cannot be accepted?" Furthermore, the peace that the southwestern provinces of China can accept is only an honorable peace. The reporter also asked if, to your knowledge, Chairman Chiang has any intention of retreating to one side and letting others negotiate peace with Japan. Mr. Kong replied that Chairman Chiang is a brave and resolute person who does not avoid difficulties, especially in the current environment, he will never abandon his responsibility, thereby shaking the morale of the Chinese soldiers resisting the war, and the entire Chinese people will certainly not allow him to relinquish his responsibilities and retire to the countryside. The reporter then asked, "Which part of the Chinese government can represent the acceptance of a peace agreement?" Mr. Kong replied that only the entire government can consider this point. When asked how many lessons China has learned in this war, Mr. Kong replied, "Many, but Christmas is approaching, and I don't want to say more and hurt people's feelings." When asked, "Although China has ordered aircraft and other military supplies from foreign countries, what kind of methods does China have to guarantee that they will be delivered?" He replied, "In my experience, there are those who can fulfill the contract and deliver the goods, but there are also those who are timid and dare not submit. We previously ordered two Red Cross ships in the United States, but the American shipping company refused to transport them." When asked what conditions the Soviet Union supplies aircraft and pilots to China under, he replied, "The conditions are the same as those of other countries. Most of the Soviet pilots are volunteers, the same as the pilots from the United States, France, and other countries who come to China." Mr. Kong expressed gratitude to the American people for their sympathy towards China and to President Roosevelt for his friendly attitude towards China, but he was very regretful about the actions of the American neutralists who hindered the United States from fulfilling its international obligations. He also said that the United States only has sympathy for China and cannot stop Japan's aggression. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)

### German Government Declares It Will Not Return to Geneva

Italy's Withdrawal From the League Shows German and Japanese Inducement; Collective Security System Has Come to an End

[Berlin] After Italy withdrew from the League of Nations, the German government issued a statement last night, stating that the question of Germany returning to the League of Nations will no longer be considered. It went on to point out that since the end of the Great War, the League of Nations has only been an organization to protect the interests of those who benefited from the Treaty of Versailles. It has been indifferent to how to solve practical international problems and how to make reasonable adjustments to natural resources to meet the needs of various countries. Its failure has been proven today and cannot be disputed. This fundamental error cannot be achieved through partial reforms. All countries except Moscow have recognized that Geneva's "collective security policy" has in fact had the opposite effect and produced "collective insecurity," which is why Germany, Japan, and Italy have successively announced their withdrawal. The official document concluded that Germany and Italy, in any case, firmly believe that the Geneva organization is not only wrong but also should be condemned, so the question of Germany returning to the League of Nations will no longer be considered. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

[Berlin] Regarding Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the German government issued a communique this afternoon stating that after Italy's withdrawal, Germany's return to the League of Nations is even less likely to be considered. Germany firmly believes that the existence of the League of Nations is detrimental and useless. Italy has also repeatedly stated its views on this. It can be seen from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech at the "May" Square near Berlin when he visited Germany in late September, referring to the League of Nations as the "demon of Geneva." Now that Italy has withdrawn from the League of Nations, Germany enthusiastically approves of it, and the international situation is becoming clearer as a result. Furthermore, since its establishment, the League of Nations has not only failed to contribute to the solution of various problems in the world political situation, but on the contrary, it has had an unfavorable impact on various events that have occurred after the European War, and it has had a dangerous impact. The League of Nations also gradually became a tool for certain countries, that is, countries that benefited from the Treaty of Versailles, in the name of implementing so-called various ideals. It not only cannot take into account the inherent strengths of various nations and the needs related to survival, and promote international policies based on a reasonable balance of power, so as to achieve results, but on the contrary, all actions are enough to hinder the development of this policy. In short, the League of Nations can no longer be regarded as the highest authority responsible for representing all countries in the world and carrying out international cooperation. Even if its covenant is partially revised, it is difficult to make up for various shortcomings. Therefore, the League of Nations can be said to have completely failed, and the facts are there and cannot be disputed. "At present, after the collective security system has come to an end, it has become a 'collective insecurity' system, and is supported independently by the Soviet Union without reservation. This has gradually been understood by various small countries." (Havas dispatch, 12th)

[Geneva] Geneva believes that Germany's statement that the issue of Germany's return to the League of Nations cannot be considered is even more unfavorable than Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, because this statement is a systematic pre-determined policy, making cooperation with the League of Nations in the future impossible. This statement should be a sign that Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations was due to the inducement of Germany and Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Comments from Various Countries

England

[London] According to reliable sources here today, Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations was expected by people in London long ago. Therefore, Italy's final decision is only a legal recognition of the situation that has become a reality. It is believed that the Italian government made this decision purely for domestic reasons, in order to divert the public's attention from domestic difficulties. Therefore, Britain does not want to overemphasize Italy's move. In any case, Italy's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations will not affect the British government's policy in the slightest. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

France

[Paris] French newspapers today harshly criticized Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's resolution announced last night that Italy would withdraw from the League of Nations. "Le Temps" stated that Mussolini has divided the world into two groups, but has lost his hope of threatening Britain and France. Another newspaper stated that there was a vague hope that Italy's passive decision could have a positive response in the form of a proposal to reorganize the League of Nations, but the Italian prime minister has now abandoned this plan. "Le Populaire" stated that what is now more suspicious is that Rome is accelerating the German-Italian axis, and Italy is its engine. The temperature in Europe has risen several degrees due to Rome's posture. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Russia

[Moscow] Regarding Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, this place does not find it strange. Russian diplomatic sources also said that Britain and France are working hard to ease the situation in Europe. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini actually announced his withdrawal from the alliance at this time, which shows that the policy of "concessions to aggressor countries" is of no benefit. Although the international situation will not change in any way due to Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

America

[Washington] According to the opinion of those who are well-informed here, Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations will not have a significant impact on the European situation, because this is only putting a situation that has existed for 18 months into a formal stage. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### British Newspaper Warns Japan

Must Know That Britain's Patience Also Has a Certain Limit

[London] The News Chronicle published an editorial today entitled "Limit," stating that the Japanese army has always shown disregard for the British flag in this invasion of China. The article listed in detail the cases involving British expatriates. The article then stated that Japan is good at apologizing without repenting. It may think that it can still apologize for its bombing of British warships and merchant ships. Today, Japan must be told in the most severe terms possible that even Britain's patience has a limit. Japan must be made to pay full compensation so that it knows to restrain its wild warriors. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### General 末次 Appointed Home Minister

[Tokyo] According to today's official announcement, Home Minister Baba Eiichi has resigned due to illness. His successor is General Sueyoshi Shigemasa.

### China and Russia Firmly Deny Military Agreement

[Moscow] Rumors circulating that China and the Soviet Union have entered into a military agreement have been firmly denied by officials from both Chinese and Russian circles here. The Chinese ambassador, Jiang Tingfu, denounced it as "absurd," while Soviet officials stated that the rumor contradicted Soviet foreign policy and the existing relations between China and the Soviet Union.

### New North China Organization Expected Soon

Ishii's Remarks to British Reporter; Japanese Spokesman Claims No Constraints

[Tokyo] This morning, Reuters reporters, referring to Ishii's conversation with a reporter from the Sunday Times, questioned the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The spokesman firmly stated that Ishii's mission was purely informal. While Ishii's opinions are naturally respected by Japan, they are his personal opinions, and the Japanese government is not bound by them, as he has no connection with the government. The new government in North China is expected to be established within a few days. Whether the government will be limited to North China or expand to all of China has not yet been decided. He personally expects it to extend to all of China because Chinese sympathizers who are anti-communist support cooperation with Japan. (Reuters, 13th)

[Beiping] According to sources among Japanese locals here, discussions regarding the organization of a new Chinese government to replace the Nanjing central government have been progressing smoothly in recent days. Japan is preparing to establish a federation similar to Switzerland within the occupied Chinese territories, gradually adding provincial governments. In preparation for this organization, a so-called "Government Committee" will be established, chaired by an "Interim Premier." It is rumored that former President Cao Kun (the 1923 bribery-elected president) will be appointed to the position of "Interim Premier." (Guomin Haitong News Agency, 13th)

### Manchurian Railway's Activities Plan in North China

Matsuoka Returns to Tokyo, Seeking Government Understanding

[Tokyo] Matsuoka Yosuke, President of the Manchurian Railway, has arrived in Tokyo, seeking the Japanese government's understanding of the railway's activities plan in North China. When Matsuoka met with reporters today, he admitted that he had submitted his privately drafted North China economic development plan to the government in August, but its content was greatly misunderstood by the newspapers. Matsuoka also stated that the Manchurian Railway only intends to manage the railways and harbor projects in North China, as well as coal mines along the railway lines. As for the management of other industries, such as raw cotton, cotton weaving, and salt, it will be left to others. According to Matsuoka, the Manchurian Railway has prepared 500 million Japanese yen for the economic development of North China and hopes to raise another 100 million Japanese yen in North China.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Calls for Assistance

Letter to International Women's Association

[Geneva] The World Women's Peace Association has recently received a letter from Madame Soong Mei-ling, the wife of General Chiang Kai-shek, stating that China is fighting for its survival. She wrote, "Japan has been expanding its military and preparing to invade China, aiming to dominate Asia, for decades. The Japanese Prime Minister, Konoe Fumimaro, has even stated that he will force China to surrender. In this situation, China has no choice but to fight to the death and contend with the enemy. The unity of our country is stronger than ever before. The people know that we are fighting to defend our families and the survival of our nation. The Japanese army is massacring innocent civilians by the tens of thousands. The only way to stop this brutality is through economic pressure. In other words, the boycott of Japanese goods is the most effective weapon for achieving peace and freedom outside of military force." (Havas, 13th)

### International Youth Organization Sympathizes with China

### Japan Actively Building Warships

Attracts Attention of Britain and the United States; British Navy Continues to Recruit New Soldiers

[London] The news that Japan is building three battleships armed with 16-inch guns and displacing 46,000 tons has attracted sharp attention here. Newspapers point out that this move is related to the Sino-Japanese war and Japan's general foreign policy. According to reports, Britain's largest battleship, the "Hood," has a displacement of 46,200 tons, but it is the only ship of its kind. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

[New York] A Washington correspondent for the New York Times claimed today that the US government is currently studying persistent rumors that Japan is building three massive battleships. According to informal but reliable sources, Japan is currently building three battleships weighing 46,000 tons and equipped with 16-inch guns. An article published in an Italian newspaper last month lends credence to this belief, not only because the information contained in the article coincides with what is known here about Japan's shipbuilding program, but also because the article was published at the same time as the announcement of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Italy, Germany, and Japan. According to the article, 63 other warships have either begun construction or are in the planning stages, including five aircraft carriers, seven light cruisers, 43 destroyers, and eight submarines. (Reuters, 12th)

[London] According to statistics released by the British Admiralty, the navy recruited a total of 11,508 new recruits this year, an increase of 3,349 compared to 8,159 last year. The British Navy is developing rapidly and still needs to recruit 16,000 to 17,000 new recruits, which should not be difficult to achieve. (Havas, 13th)

### French-Yugoslav Diplomatic Talks in Progress

Maintaining Old Friendship; Yugoslavia Not Joining Anti-Comintern Pact

⊙Belgrade, Yugoslavia Regarding the talks between French Foreign Minister Delbos and Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, responsible sources here recently stated that Foreign Minister Delbos informed Prime Minister Stojadinović of the recent discussions with the authorities of Poland and Romania, which Stojadinović was satisfied to hear. Stojadinović then informed Delbos of the talks he had with Italian officials during his visit to Rome and reiterated that the Yugoslav government had no intention of joining the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan. Regarding the Spanish issue, Stojadinović said that the Yugoslav government had not yet followed Britain's lead in sending a commercial representative to the Spanish Nationalist government for fear that such a move would be misinterpreted by outsiders as being related to Foreign Minister Delbos's visit to Yugoslavia shortly after Stojadinović's return from Rome, and thus a decision had been delayed. As for his visit to Italy, it was only a reciprocal visit, as Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had previously visited Yugoslavia, and no political talks were conducted. Furthermore, Yugoslavia wishes to maintain good relations with Italy and Germany to avoid causing various complications internationally, but at the same time, it does not wish to harm the friendship between France and Yugoslavia. Responsible sources here greatly value Prime Minister Stojadinović's statement after his visit to Rome that the main principle of Yugoslav foreign policy remains the maintenance of good relations between France and Yugoslavia, and they believe that the new French-Yugoslav commercial agreement, scheduled to be signed on the 14th of this month, and the decision of both governments to promote mutual relations in economic and cultural fields, demonstrate that the relations between the two countries are indeed very harmonious.

[New York] After the counter-revolutionary case occurred in Soviet Russia last year, the leader of the anti-cadre faction in that country, Trotsky, made a statement in Mexico City, denying that he and his son had instigated the affair, and advocated the formation of an international commission to investigate the truth.

### 100,000 People in Dongting Xishan on the Brink of Starvation

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that Dongting Xishan originally had a population of 50,000, but since the Sino-Japanese war began, people from various places have regarded it as a safe haven and have moved there in large numbers, increasing the population to over 100,000. However, the stored food is limited and is now on the verge of depletion. The Japanese army does not allow residents to go out to buy food. If they are not allowed to go out soon, they will all starve to death. There are several missionaries stationed there who have tried their best to save the situation. It is heard that the Japanese army has invited them to work at the Japanese military hospital in Huzhou, but because the travel permits have not been issued, they will also perish with the Chinese.

### Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association Senders Returning Home for Third Time

Detouring via Guangdong to Return

The Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai has organized the sending of fellow-provincials back to their hometown for two times. It is reported that the third group of more than 200 registered people will be sent off today. According to the association, the Yangtze River route is blocked and it is also difficult to detour through Nantong, so it is planned to go to Hong Kong first, detour through Guangdong, and then transfer to Hunan, waiting for a boat back to their hometown in Changsha. Therefore, the journey is long and the travel expenses are also relatively high, requiring about 40 to 50 yuan per person.

### Recent Situation of Japanese Businesses in This Port

Extremely Desolate Scene

Yesterday, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Nichi-Nichi Shimbun" reported that in the past, every year after December 10th, Japanese stores in the Wusong Road and North Sichuan Road area would hold large-scale price reductions or special lotteries, and the commercial war would be very lively. This year, it has been completely suspended. Silk stores display food items, and sundry goods stores only sell cigarettes and yokan (sweet bean jelly), which is almost the same as on the battlefield, quite chaotic. In addition, confectionery stores, which used to promote New Year's cakes and advertise extensively, have now fallen sharply. The most affected are restaurants and dance halls. Dance halls are almost deserted, and restaurants have not been patronized for year-end parties and New Year's banquets, which are usually held from December to January.

### Recent Situation of Finance in North China

— A Translation by Zang

The financial organization of North China was originally a tripartite system of foreign banks, Chinese banks, and silver shops. However, after the government's monetary reform in 1935, all silver was nationalized, and the traditional silver standard was changed to the pound sterling, creating a fully managed currency system. This marked the great success of China's monetary reform, which became centralized. Previously, China's banknote issuing system was a decentralized system, with a mixture of free system and franchise system. In Tianjin, in addition to the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China, there were nine other banks that also had the function of issuing banknotes. Now, the function of issuing banknotes is centralized and unified in the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China. Banknotes from other banks have been replaced by the banknotes of these three banks. According to the Central Bank's "Financial Weekly" report for November, from October to November 30, the number of banknotes issued reached 261,815,000 yuan, including Central Bank 32,343,000 yuan, Bank of China 115,161,000 yuan, Four Banks Savings Association 1,500,000 yuan, China Industrial Bank 1,750,000 yuan, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank 1,500,000 yuan, China Reclamation Bank 90,000 yuan, Zhejiang Industrial Bank 20,000 yuan, Dazhong Bank 560,000 yuan, Hebei Provincial Bank 50,000,000 yuan, Frontier Bank 50,000 yuan, and Peiyang Baoshang Bank 3,000,000 yuan. (The above units are in thousands of yuan.) Before the implementation of the new monetary system, the number of banknotes circulating in the Tianjin area was about 60 million yuan, but recently it has reached 260 million yuan, an increase of 200 million yuan. After the monetary reform, the local reserve system became centralized. Banks in North China established a Issuing Reserve Management Committee in Tianjin to maintain all the silver holdings of the various banks. After the incident, all the silver was transferred to the Body Governing Committee for management, strictly monitoring its free disposal. At the time, rumors circulated that some of the silver had been sent to the south, but according to the committee's announcement, there are currently 40,172,000 yuan of silver in storage, including 18,712,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications, 16,608,000 yuan from the Bank of China, 4,672,000 yuan from the Hebei Provincial Bank, and 179,000 yuan from the Central Bank, plus 1.8 million yuan of silver miscellaneous coins and 13,200 yuan of Bank of Communications subsidy silver stored in the Central Bank. As for the silver held by foreign banks, it has all been transferred to the central government, except for 5 million yuan still held by Japan. Before the monetary reform, the central government had a franchise system for domestic banks to issue banknotes, while foreign banks were allowed to issue freely. However, now the circulation of foreign currency in North China is restricted and is completely monopolized by Chinese banks. However, the Yokohama Specie Bank notes in Tianjin are still very popular, and the rest are very small in number. Before the incident, the circulation of Japanese gold yen was very difficult. For example, Japanese banknotes were only about 1 million yuan, and Korean Bank notes were about 3 million yuan. After the incident, it was decided to use Korean Bank notes to pay for the Japanese military's expenses, and a huge amount of Japanese banknotes circulated in the Pingjin area. Not only in the Pingjin area, but also in the occupied areas of the Japanese army, they all circulated. Therefore, since the incident, Korean Bank notes have increased by 40 million yuan. The exchange rate of Japanese yen to Chinese legal tender is still one yuan for one yuan.

The general situation of the financial community in North China is as described above, but since the incident, what impact has the financial market in North China suffered, and how will it develop in the future? This is worth our attention. Judging from the financial phenomena caused by this incident, the most obvious impact is on the exchange market. Before the incident, the Tianjin exchange market followed the Shanghai market and did not change much, with one shilling and two pence eight and three-eighths for the pound sterling, US$29.85 for the US dollar, and 103 yuan for 100 Japanese yen. After the outbreak of the incident, the exchange market gradually declined because it was cut off from Shanghai. One week after the incident, the rate was one shilling and two pence one-quarter for the pound sterling and US$29.25 for the US dollar. Later, as the incident expanded, the market became more unstable. When the huge amount of military expenses required by Japan was decided to be paid in Korean Bank notes, the amount of Korean Bank notes circulating in the market increased day by day. On the one hand, the demand for silver increased sharply due to the fulfillment of sales contracts, and the number of local purchases of military supplies such as gasoline and automobiles was also large, and all payments had to be made in cash, resulting in a shortage of silver. Japanese gold, Korean Bank notes, suddenly lost their original value. At the end of August, the external market for silver and gold yen was one shilling and two pence nineteen thirty-seconds for the pound sterling, US$30.85 for the US dollar, and 107 yuan for 100 Japanese yen. At this point, the Japanese side caused great panic. After consultation with the Japanese military department, the consulate general, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Korean Bank, and other relevant parties, four measures were proposed: (1) Proclaim in a certain city the use of military scrip; (2) Take over the Hebei Provincial Bank; (3) Mobilize Japan's foreign exchange reserves to adjust cash; (4) Temporarily borrow cash from Chinese banks. As a result, the fourth method was adopted, and Japanese banks temporarily borrowed cash from Chinese banks in an attempt to salvage the situation. Therefore, Chinese banks began to cooperate with Japanese banks. However, the implementation of future financial work in North China still depends on the attitude of Chinese banks. Although Japanese banks have been able to maintain it temporarily, it is not a fundamental solution. It is found that Korean Bank notes fell sharply to 80 yuan at the end of August. Fortunately, they gradually recovered. By the end of October, the import of wheat flour from Japan gradually increased, order in Pingjin gradually recovered, and due to the needs of winter clothing and other expenses, the market cash gradually increased. Recently, the exchange value of Japanese gold and Chinese legal tender is 97 yuan of legal tender can be exchanged for 100 yuan of Japanese gold. Later, the Shanghai incident occurred again. The Tianjin Banking Association of China and the Native Bankers' Association, knowing that the situation was not easy to clean up, agreed on emergency measures and restricted the amount of deposit payments, and the financial market suddenly became congested. Later, due to the import of a large amount of wheat flour and other daily necessities from Japan, people's hearts gradually stabilized, and funds gradually circulated in the market. Thanks to the "Bank of China", the financial situation began to ease. At present, the specific figures for the status of Japanese banks cannot be clarified because the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Korean Bank, and the Tianjin Bank cannot publish them. However, after various emergency measures, the three banks have gradually stabilized. In the future, as the Japanese army enters and exits various places, the rapid increase in the circulation of Japanese gold and whether the exchange value of Chinese legal tender can be maintained in equilibrium is still a question.

### League of Nations Medical Team Departs for China

A medical team from the League of Nations, consisting of Dr. Robertson and more than ten others, departed from Geneva on the 10th of this month to come to China for disaster and epidemic relief. The team is divided into three groups (English, French, and German). Dr. Robertson is the director of Lester Institute of Medical Research in this city and former health director of the Public Works Department. He has extensive knowledge of China's water quality and land conditions. His arrival in China this time should be of great benefit.

### Women's Handicraft Relief Goods Exhibition and Sale

Moved to the Great New World. Exquisite and Unparalleled Prizes.

The handicraft relief exhibition and sale initiated by the women's circles in this city was originally scheduled to be held on the 18th and 19th of this month at the American Women's Club on Jing'an Temple Road. However, due to the small size of the club, which is insufficient for use, an agreement has been reached with Mr. Cai Chang, the general manager of the Great New World Company, to hold it on the fourth floor of the company. Tickets are priced at one yuan each and will be sold on the spot on the fourth floor. Various participating groups, schools, and enthusiastic public-spirited ladies are currently promoting the event, with excellent results. The tickets are prize-bearing in nature. Prizes have been donated by the Great New World Company, the Home Industry Society, Liu Wang Liming, Chen Naiwen, Zhu Zhixian, Li Qiujun, and others. Several thousand items have been collected, the most exquisite of which are the doll collection by Deng Liyan, Mo Xijin, Pan Qiaozhen, Han Huaying, and other members of the Women's Production Cooperative; the Chinese and Western Spring Mountains; and the Zoo of the Public Works Department Girls' School, all of which are handmade and perfectly cater to children's psychology. In addition, there are Mrs. Li's women's flat-belly trousers; Russian cakes, Jewish sandwiches, Cantonese barbecued pork buns, and the Manna eaten by the Israelites in the wilderness in the International Tea Room's food section. This room is managed by Ms. Zhong Huiqing, and the hostesses are all beautiful young ladies from various countries.

### Levying Shallow Water Fees on Goods Transported to Tianjin

Shanghai-Tianjin passenger and freight transport still congested. Customs notice on shipping procedures.

Because the winter shallow water season has arrived in Tianjin Port, the navigation of vessels from Shanghai to Tianjin has begun levying freight lighterage fees on the 4th of this month. Details of the situation are as follows:

Implementation of Lighterage Fees

The Shanghai-Tianjin shipping line has been virtually monopolized by two foreign companies since the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, passenger and freight transport is quite congested. However, during the shallow water season every winter, vessels sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin find it difficult to berth directly at the riverbank and must use lighters to load and unload passengers and cargo. Therefore, the Taikoo and Jardine companies in this port have begun to levy lighterage fees from the 4th of this month, increasing the water rate by 15%.

Commencement of Buoy Removal

The River and Sea Customs Patrol Engineering Department issued a notice regarding Tianjin River navigation yesterday, stating that, with the arrival of winter and the approach of ice, all navigation marks in Tianjin Port have been gradually removed from the 1st of this month. With the exception of the deep-water channel buoy, all other buoys and lightships will be replaced with black cylindrical buoys in their original positions. However, the deep-water light buoy will be replaced with a wooden marker in the shape of an ice ball with a top. The marker is placed on the transversal dam.

Names of Each Light Buoy

The names of the original light buoys are listed below: ㊀ Dagu Lightship; ㊁ Dagu Entrance Light Buoy; ㊂ Dagu Sandbar End Buoy; ㊃ Channel Guidance Buoys Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4; ㊄ Deep Water Channel Light Buoy; ㊅ Dagu Barrier Sand Lightship. The department has notified all foreign shipping lines to comply with the above navigation conditions.

### Extremely Strict Inspection of People Crossing to Pudong

Female Auditors Also Dispatched to Prevent Insults to Women

After the "Great Road Municipal Government" of Pudong was established, the Yangjing, Donggou, and Gaoqiao ferry crossings were temporarily closed, and the "Municipal Government" opened the Dongchang Road ferry crossing to allow people to cross to Pudong, making it easier to inspect and register them. The inspection personnel at the docks are now divided into male and female categories. This is because, in order to prevent insults during the search of women, there are now several female inspectors as well. Their salaries are slightly lower than those of the guards. These police officers are all trained by the Pacification Department and are under the jurisdiction of the Police Department, but the Pacification Department has the power of control. They have all begun performing their duties. After boarding the dock, the inspection and registration procedures require going through four checkpoints, which inevitably delays time. Since both going to and returning from Pudong require inspection, the public considers it a daunting task. At the same time, those coming to Shanghai from Pudong must go through this procedure, so the people returning to Pudong are not enthusiastic.

### Japanese Troops Continue to Search and Arrest in Refugee Areas

Father Jacquinot Claims to Still Manage the Area

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that the majority of the Japanese troops who entered the Nanshi refugee area on Saturday and Sunday had withdrawn yesterday morning. The Japanese troops entered the area allegedly because a Japanese soldier was shot at in a certain location within the area. According to a statement issued by Father Jacquinot yesterday, "I have fully discussed this matter with Japanese military officers. To my knowledge, no Japanese soldier has been shot at anywhere in the area." It is heard that the Japanese troops moved a batch of refugees from the area to the southern part of Nanshi yesterday, presumably to be used as laborers. Father Jacquinot stated yesterday that the Refugee Area Committee will continue to manage the special area, and there is no question of the Japanese authorities taking over. The Japanese authorities will continue to abide by the agreement establishing the refugee area.

### Statistics on the Number of People and Supplies in the Two Special Zones' Shelters

According to Mr. Li Guiyong, a standing committee member of the International Relief Committee, the two special zones in this city currently have a total of 194 shelters, housing a total of 144,947 refugees. The First Special Zone has 154 shelters, housing 91,597 people, and the Second Special Zone has 40 shelters, housing 53,350 people. These statistics are based on the rice calculations recently issued by the Nanshi Special Zone authorities. Since each shelter must have officials from the Special Zone authorities verify their situation before applying for rice distribution, they are relatively accurate. The distribution and number of people in each shelter in the two special zones are as follows: The Western District of the First Special Zone has 75 shelters, housing a total of 46,859 people; the Central District has 60 shelters, housing 31,107 people; the Northern District has recently been opened, with 18 shelters, housing 13,631 people; the Second Special Zone has a total of 40 shelters, housing 53,350 people. The number of people in each shelter varies, with the Mu'er Church having the fewest at 19 people and Jiaotong University having the most at 17,070 people. Shelters with more people are the most economical and cost-effective in terms of management, labor, and purchasing materials, otherwise the opposite is true. There are eleven larger shelters in the two special zones, housing approximately one-third of the total number of refugees in the two special zones. They include Jiaotong University with 17,000 people, the Catholic Shelter in Xujiahui with 8,000 people, the Guangdong Shelter on Xinzha Road with 5,060 people, the New World with 4,812 people, the International Shelter with 4,427 people, the Great World with 3,591 people, the Tianchan Stage with 2,325 people, Aurora University with 2,450 people, the God of Wealth Temple with 2,293 people, the Yanping Road Shelter with 2,286 people, and the Macau Road Shelter with 2,143 people. The above eleven shelters house a total of 54,387 people. There are nine shelters with very few people, ranging from 19 to 44 people. The nine shelters house a total of 286 people. The supply situation for each shelter in the Special Zones is as follows: Each refugee receives 11 ounces of rice per day, totaling 454 bags of rice per day; each person receives 1.5 taels of vegetables per day, totaling 6.5 tons of vegetables per day; each person receives 0.75 taels of oil, salt, and soy sauce per day, totaling 3 tons of oil, salt, and soy sauce per day; each person uses 1 and 1/3 pounds of coal and firewood per day, totaling 88 and 1/3 tons of coal and firewood per day. A separate statistical report will be provided on the various conditions in the Nanshi refugee area.

### Chinese Red Cross Sends Personnel to Nanyang for Fundraising

The Chinese Red Cross Society, due to the increasing size of the refugee and wounded soldier relief problem, and the growing lack of funds within the Society, the board of directors resolved to send Feng Shaoshan and Wang Zhisheng to the Nanyang Islands to solicit donations from overseas Chinese. Mr. Feng and Mr. Wang will depart soon.

### Two Refugee Vocational Training Centers Soon to be Established

In this city, Lin Kanghou, Yan Fuqing, Wang Kuisheng, Ye Zhisheng, Zhang Zidao, Yang Peiwen, and more than 20 others are establishing a refugee vocational training center to engage in production for the purpose of relieving manual worker refugees. They will start with small-scale production of daily necessities that are easy to produce, such as carpentry, bamboo work, shoemaking, and tinware. Once they are on a slightly larger scale, they will gradually supplement the plan. The office is currently located at Zhen, Jili, at the northern end of Chengdu Road, Baike Road. Once the survey of technical refugees in each shelter is completed, they will begin work. Donations of broken clothes, old machines, wooden boards, broken bamboo, scrap tin, and other miscellaneous materials are welcome. Since the start of the Shanghai War, there have been hundreds of thousands of refugees. Although they are sheltered by various charitable organizations, simply eating without working is not a good plan. Many people in the financial and industrial sectors, as well as philanthropists, have initiated the organization of the Hengqin Refugee Vocational Training Center and have drafted an outline of eight items, which has been supported by Qu Yingguang, chairman of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, and Huang Hanzhi, chairman of the Cilian Association. The outline has now been printed. Those interested in reading it can write to Director Li of the Qunyi Girls' School on Ai'erjin Road, North Henan Road.

### Statistics on the Number of People Leaving Shanghai from the Start of the War to the End of October

The Public Works Department Announces the Refugee Situation

According to the Public Works Department, the number of refugees within the settlement and the situation of repatriation in September and October of this year are as follows: At the end of September of this year, there were 103 refugee shelters in the northern area, housing 53,767 refugees. By the end of October, there were 110 refugee shelters in the northern area, housing 72,070 refugees. In addition, there are approximately 4,190 refugees living in the alleys and vacant houses within the settlement. As for the number of people repatriated from Shanghai in October, it totaled 64,370 people. Since the start of the Shanghai War until the end of October, the total number of people leaving Shanghai and returning to the mainland has reached 371,270 people.

### Zhu Qinglan Goes to Chongqing

According to news from local charitable organizations, Zhu Qinglan took a train to Chongqing at 8:00 AM on the 13th. A certain Dharma master traveled with him.

### Soliciting News from Zhenze

Since the town of Zhenze, Wujiang, was lost last month, traffic has been blocked and news has been cut off. Many fellow villagers in Shanghai are concerned about news from their hometown. If there is anyone who has recently come to Shanghai from their hometown, please immediately inform Qiu Baifan, 2nd Floor, No. 309 Hankou Road, or call 93245 to 84, so that the news can be relayed to fellow villagers. This is what we earnestly hope for.

### Red Swastika Society's Relief Work in the Refugee Area

Establishment of Chinese and Western Medicine Clinics, Maternity Shelters. The Quantity of Items Donated by All Sectors is Also Very Considerable.

Since the war front moved west, refugees in the Pudong and Nanshi areas have had no way to escape and have gathered at the junction of the French and Chinese areas, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands. They are exposed to the elements and suffering miserably. The flames are soaring into the sky, and it is unbearable to look back. The sounds of gunfire in the Ximen area are urgent. Refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, wail and cry to the heavens. It is unbearable to hear. Upon hearing the news, the Red Swastika Society dispatched a relief team to the area on November 10th to carry out relief work. For more than a month, the society's relief team has been transporting dry food, carrying out sanitation and cleaning, installing street lights, and establishing Chinese and Western medicine clinics in the area. All aspects of their work have been extremely diligent. A special description is as follows:

Establishment of Office

When refugees gathered in the Min Country Road area, the society's relief team took care of them on the spot, transporting food every day and assisting the International Relief Committee in its work. It also placed multiple tea barrels to provide drinks for the refugees, installed street lights, and established a temporary office for the relief team at the old site of the Deyilou restaurant in the area, with Mr. Xue Lisheng in charge. Personnel were dispatched to work separately, and the team leader, Hu Zhongsang, led the entire team to transport bread, clothing, cotton quilts, coffins, Chinese and Western medicines, and other items on several of the society's regular trucks every day, morning and afternoon, specializing in relieving the refugee area, working day and night, which was quite tense.

Clinic Equipment

Recognizing that diseases were rampant among the refugees in the area and deaths were occurring in succession, the society established a temporary Chinese and Western medicine clinic at the old site of the Suxiangzhai restaurant, appointing the team's chief supervisor, Mr. Hu Zhonglai, as the director, and Mr. Tao Shanxian as the administrative director. It invited Chinese medicine practitioners Zhang Cigong, Ding Chaozong, Liu Jiaopu, Zhang Yishan, and Han Wenpu, Western medicine practitioners Hu Jiayan, Jiang Yisheng, and Shen Zaizhong, and more than ten nurses to provide voluntary treatment. Outpatient hours are from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM every day, and Chinese and Western medicines are provided. Seriously ill patients are kept in the clinic for treatment. The number of Chinese and Western hospital beds can be increased to more than 120. Chinese medicines are purchased and distributed within the settlement, while Western medicines are purchased and stored by the society for use. In addition, a separate maternity shelter has been established, which has already accommodated more than 50 pregnant women.

Sanitation and Hygiene

Due to the large number of refugees in the refugee area, people were defecating everywhere, making the area extremely filthy. The team's office hired more than 50 workers to sweep and clean the area on a daily basis, using garbage trucks to transport the waste out every day. It also used the open space in the Town God's Temple to equip public toilets and purchase chamber pots, which are now as clean as usual.

Quantity of Items

The society's relief team transports food every day and hands it over to the International Relief Committee's office for distribution. As of the 7th of this month, the society has donated a total of more than 335,000 steamed buns and flatbreads. In addition, those donated and transported by all sectors totaled more than 1,224,400 steamed buns and flatbreads, plus 46 truckloads and 1,800 catties. More than 4,000 cotton clothes and 1,750 cotton quilts have been distributed, and they are still being distributed. The society also distributes rice, vegetables, coal, and medicines to provide relief.

Undertaking Corpses

Many refugees in the area died due to hunger, cold, and disease. The society's relief team has undertaken many corpses. In the past month, there have been a total of 360 corpses of all sizes, and 224 coffins have been donated. As for burial work, it was initially carried out by the Pushan Villa, but it has now been transferred to the Sirens Supplementary Yuan Hall. However, there is a shortage of coffins, and it is hoped that philanthropic people from all sectors will provide assistance. The merit will be immeasurable.

### Shen Bao Cup Charity Basketball Tournament Opened Yesterday: Chinese Team Lost to the American Team by Three Points

Wonderful Performance, Result: 45 to 48. Enthusiastic Audience, the Second Match Tomorrow Night Will Be Even More Exciting.

The Chinese and American basketball teams of this port held the first "Shen Bao Cup" charity competition at the Western Youth Association at 8:00 PM last night. Tickets were priced at one yuan and two yuan. Enthusiastic people from all walks of life who went to watch numbered six or seven hundred people. All ticket proceeds were donated to charitable organizations to be used for refugee relief and other expenses. Both teams are excellent players in this city. Although they have been practicing for a long time, the competition was still colorful and emotional. The American team was formed by the Marines and the Western Youth Association team, while the Chinese team was represented by the newly organized United team participating in the Western Youth Association League, which is very strong. In the first half, the American team was superior with a score of 29 to 22. In the second half, the Chinese team once reversed the defeat with a score of 43 to 38. Unfortunately, in the end, the American team won with a score of 48 to 45. The referee was Zhang Guoxun. Tomorrow night at 8:00 PM, the two teams will compete for the second time at the same venue.

Inadequate Defense

The huge Shen Bao Cup shone even more brilliantly under the illumination of the electric lights, attracting the attention of the entire field. After gathering the players from both teams for a photo, the competition began. The American team first fought with the Marines, while the Chinese team was composed of five players: Zhou Dayun, Feng Nianhua, Chen Xuechong, Cai Yanxiong, and Cai Wenhuan. Both sides had well-organized lineups. Cai Yanxiong opened the scoring, which boosted morale. Chen Xuechong missed a chance under the basket, and Xiao Feng Yan scored another three points, taking the lead with a score of 5 to 0. The atmosphere grew even more intense. The American team launched a fierce attack, with Tuileto scoring a goal. Afterwards, each added one point with a free throw. Honsvis and Allen relied on their excellent connection and scored five points in a row, reversing the lead with a score of 8 to 6. After Xiao Feng made a free throw, Sun Binqing replaced Cai Wenhuan. The American team's momentum was quite strong, and the Chinese team's defense was sometimes inadequate. In a short time, they fell behind with a score of 7 to 15.

American Team Takes the Lead

Lu Zhong'en replaced Zhou Dayun and tried his best to attack with the assistance of the defenders. Chen Xuechong and Sun Binqing scored points one after another, making the score 12 to 15, which was a hopeful improvement. The entire Marines team came off the court and was replaced by five players, including Rhein Carlson of the Western Youth Association, who were able to conserve their energy. The Chinese team was in a state of collapse, with lax defense and a chaotic lineup. The American team relied on the tall Rhein, who occupied the basket, and Kardebula and Blair, who roamed the sides, with Piquier assisting from behind, allowing them to respond easily. The score increased rapidly, doubling the score to 26 to 13. Feng Nianhua was under Carlson's supervision and had little activity. Assisting Lu Zhong'en and Sun Binqing was not always effective. Although Cai Yanxiong and Chen Xuechong struggled hard, they were unable to make up for the losses. At the end of the first half, the American team was superior with a score of 29 to 22.

Sudden Rise of the Chinese Team

At the start of the second half, both sides continued to fight with their strongest lineups. The Marines continued to display their tight connection skills, with Tuile and Wang Erde adding four points. The Chinese team was unwilling to show weakness, and their connection gradually became more skilled. Each person was able to exert their power. Feng Nianhua scored two out of two free throws, and Chen Xuechong added the finishing touch, adding six points in a row, which showed a sudden improvement. After Tuile scored again, the Chinese team added another four points, making the score 34 to 32. The Chinese team was only two points behind. At this time, the spectators were radiant and vigorously cheered, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. Then, Cai Yanxiong was seen making a throw from both sides, hitting the center of the basket, making the score a tie at 34. Chen Xuechong then scored a point with a free throw, leading by one point with a score of 35 to 34. The momentum suddenly rose. Although the American team quickly adjusted their personnel, sending the Western Youth Association team onto the court, they still did not improve. Under the vigorous development of the Chinese team, Feng Nianhua and Chen Xuechong continued to score eight more points, winning by a large margin with a score of 43 to 34.

Regrettable Defeat in the End

The Chinese team was at its peak, but it seemed that its strength would decline again and enter the end of its power. This was because they had been practicing for a long time and their long-term strength was insufficient. The American team took turns in two shifts, giving them sufficient rest time. At this time, they were seen regaining their energy and the situation improved. Pisel ran quickly and his skills were clever, which was a major problem for the Chinese team. Suddenly, he scored three goals in a row, adding six points, making the score 40 to 43. The Chinese team was still leading by three points. Unexpectedly, Cai Yanxiong was suddenly transferred out at this time and replaced by Zhang Liang. The morale was inevitably relaxed. Carson and Rhein scored again, and Pisel scored another goal, reversing the lead with a score of 46 to 43. At this time, there were still two minutes left. The Chinese team made a final counterattack. Lu Zhong'en scored a basket under the basket, only one point behind. Afterwards, in the persistent battle, the Chinese team had no chance to shoot. In the end, Rhein's long arm shot the ball into the basket, ending the game with a score of 48 to 45, with the American team winning.

### Deaths in the Refugee Area Continue

More Than Ten Cases Every Day

After a period of panic in the Nanshi refugee area, it has now gradually returned to normal. However, the number of deaths is more than ten cases every day. Refugees in the shelters there do not have enough food to eat their fill, and poor families living in the refugee area can only receive 2.5 taels of rice or three buns per person per day.

### Nanhui County Town Still Firmly Defended by Commander Tao

Local Order Remains Calm as Usual

Regarding Nanhui County Town in Pudong, after our Detachment entered and stationed there, it was recently rumored that the Japanese side had dispatched aircraft to bomb it.

According to his report, the situation in Nanhui had already gradually recovered. People who had moved elsewhere have been returning successively. Since Tao Xuesheng led the detachment to enter and station there, the situation suddenly became tense. Japanese aircraft frequently flew over the area on the 10th and 11th to reconnoiter, two or three aircraft or five or six aircraft each time, but they did not drop bombs.
