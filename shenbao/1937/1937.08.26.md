### The Enemy Again Invades Luodian, Encircled on Three Sides After Our Army's Bloody Battle

Remnants of the Enemy at Shizi Lin, Yunzao Bang Lose Contact; Enemy Soldiers on Nanhui Beach Suffer Heavy Losses and Retreat; We Maintain the Original Line in the Hongkou and Yangshupu Areas

According to the entire battle situation yesterday, the enemy, based on its predetermined operational plan, again invaded Luodian Town with two regiments as its main force. Our defending soldiers fought fiercely all day, using a small force to resist a larger one. After our main force arrived, they engaged in fierce fighting and encircled the enemy on three sides. Although the enemy tried its best to break through, it was ultimately impossible. As of 4:00 AM this morning, they were still surrounded. The remnant enemies who landed in the Yunzao Bang, Wusong Fort, and Shizi Lin areas were cut into several sections and lost contact after our army's full-scale attack. Their strength is no longer a concern. The battles in the Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Eastern Shanghai districts were relatively quiet. Our army maintained its original line. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River intermittently bombarded our army's positions in Pudong, but this was merely a show of force to contain our troops and was irrelevant to the overall battle situation.

### Enemy Again Invades Luodian, Now Trapped

Encircled by Us on Three Sides

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Luodian is the main town in Baoshan County, only about twelve li from Xiaochuan Sha Estuary, with convenient transportation. Therefore, the enemy army is focusing all its efforts on attacking this line. The first enemy invasion of Luodian involved about a thousand men, who were dealt with by our army on the afternoon of the 24th. The second enemy invasion involved about two regiments. As of the time this reporter was writing this morning, according to reports from the front, they have been encircled by our army on three sides and are engaged in fierce fighting, so there should be no problem. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy retreated slightly due to heavy casualties, but then a large squadron of aircraft flew in to bomb, with bullets raining down. Mud and earth splashed everywhere, and smoke filled the sky. The entire town of Luodian was almost reduced to scorched earth. Our army still held its ground and awaited reinforcements, never retreating even slightly. The sacrifice was unprecedentedly heroic. Around 3:00 PM, our main reinforcements arrived and immediately moved to the front lines, launching a vigorous attack. By dusk at 6:00 PM, the enemy was already showing signs of collapse.

Enemy Plans Main Force Invasion

When our army annihilated the enemy invading Luodian on the afternoon of the 23rd, we seized many maps and weapons used by the enemy, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that these maps were sent to Shanghai by personnel from the front headquarters and exhibited on the spot yesterday afternoon when foreign reporters were invited. An examination of the map revealed that the Luodian front line was marked for a main force invasion. Therefore, although the enemy suffered a disastrous defeat on the 23rd, it was expected that they would make a comeback. Yesterday's re-invasion was, in fact, expected. Currently, our army's morale is high, and defenses are tight. We will surely give the enemy a strong blow and shatter their operational plans.

Our Army's Morale Is a Hundredfold

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Starting at 10:00 PM last night, the enemy on the Luodian front launched an all-out attack on our lines, hoping to break out of the encirclement. Amidst dense gunfire and cannon fire, they followed with hand-to-hand combat. Our army's morale was a hundredfold, and the enemy also fought stubbornly to the death. The fierce fighting continued until 4:00 AM this morning, and the enemy is still surrounded by our army.

Our Army Searches for Remnant Enemy at Shizi Lin

Between Wusong Fort, Paotai Wan, Shizi Lin, and Xiaochuan Sha (i.e., the areas around Shidong), the enemy that landed, estimated to be about a regiment, was met with loyal and courageous resistance from our army. After two days and nights of bloody fighting, under extremely intense artillery fire from both sides, the enemy was repulsed. Yesterday, there was fierce fighting all day. The enemy resisted stubbornly, but by last night, our army had eliminated the enemy. The enemy soldiers killed by us were identified as belonging to the 11th, 43rd, and 46th columns. There are still some remaining enemy soldiers, and our army is currently searching for them.

According to official sources, before dawn on the morning of the 23rd, the enemy's 11th, 43rd, and 46th brigades suddenly used 40 to 50 small boats to cross under cover of darkness and land at Shizi Lin and Xiaochuan Sha (i.e., Shidong). Our army immediately fought bravely to meet them. By 6:00 AM, the enemy had been cut into two parts. One part fled towards Liuhe, and the other part fled towards Baoshan. Our army immediately divided its forces to pursue them. By yesterday morning (the 25th), the enemy had been completely cleared. At that time, our army found a military map in the pocket of an enemy officer killed in action, which contained a very detailed depiction of the terrain in the area where the clandestine landing took place.

Enemy Encircled at Yunzao Bang

The enemy who landed at Yunzao Bang and Zhanghuabang was given a fierce blow by our advancing troops. Most of them had been eliminated by yesterday. The remaining enemy soldiers are limited in number and have been heavily surrounded by our army. Although the remnants have repeatedly tried to break through, get on their ships and escape, they are unable to get out and are still struggling. A portion who retreated towards the riverbank were strafed by our machine guns, and countless were drowned.

(Central News Agency) According to official sources, more than 1,000 enemy soldiers clandestinely landed at Yunzao Bang on the morning of the 23rd. Our army immediately gave them a head-on blow, and the fierce fighting lasted a day and a night. By about 10:00 AM on the 24th, our reinforcements arrived and joined in, launching a fierce attack on the enemy with hand grenades and machine guns. The enemy suffered heavy losses. Our army then advanced, covered in blood, under a dense rain of bullets. The enemy army could not withstand it and fled in panic to their ships. More than 500 enemy soldiers fell into the water and drowned. Currently, there is no trace of the enemy in Yunzao Bang.

Enemy Has Collapsed on Nanhui Beach

The Central News Agency reports that before dawn the day before yesterday (the 24th), approximately 1,200 enemy soldiers suddenly landed. Our army immediately surrounded them, first using concentrated gunfire to strafe them, and then engaging in bloody hand-to-hand combat. By yesterday morning, the entire enemy force had collapsed.

The Central News Agency reports that the day before yesterday morning, several enemy warships, accompanied by small boats, arrived at Nanhui Beach and began bombarding our shore with a barrage of artillery fire. After a while, small boats filled with infantry approached the beach, riding the tide ashore. Our defending troops feigned weakness, only engaging the enemy with a small force. The enemy took advantage of the situation to advance inland. Our main defending force, waiting for the enemy to gain an unsteady foothold, used the concentrated firepower of machine guns to strafe the entire line, and also used artillery fire to threaten the enemy's rear. The enemy was in a terrible state. Our army seized the opportunity to charge and engage in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy was overwhelmed, suffering heavy casualties. Of the approximately 1,000 enemy soldiers who landed in this battle, only about 100 survived. The damage to our army's [redacted] was not significant.

One Enemy Warship Sunk, One Damaged at the Mouth of the Huangpu River

The Central News Agency reports that around 00:05 and 01:30 yesterday morning (the 25th), our air force repeatedly sortied over the Huangpu River and the mouth of the Huangpu River to bomb enemy warships. At that time, the moonlight was bright, and the sky was clear. All that could be heard was the rumbling of engines. The enemy warships at the mouth of the Huangpu River and on the Huangpu River surface shone searchlights and fired anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately. However, our pilots, bold, careful, and with superb skills, were still active in the enemy fleet. At that time, several bombs were dropped, and machine guns were fired. According to several Western passengers on the Canadian Empress of Canada, which arrived at the mouth of the Huangpu River the day before, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, they witnessed a gunboat anchored outside the mouth of the Huangpu River being sunk by us, and a destroyer being hit in the stern and severely damaged.

### Our Army Will Take Advantage of the Opportunity to Launch a Continuous Attack on the Enemy in the Hongkou and Yangshupu Areas

According to official announcements, there have been no changes to our army's lines in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas on the 25th. It is heard that our army has decided to firmly hold the advantageous positions it has gained and take the opportunity to continue attacking the enemy.

Reliable sources state that the focus of the battle in recent days has shifted to the Wusong area. The outside world is extremely concerned about the situation of our army in the Hongkou area. After the reporter inquired with those responsible in military organizations, it was said that there would be no changes to our army's lines in Hongkou. Because the remnant enemy is already heavily surrounded by us, and its repeated counterattacks have suffered great losses, the enemy now has absolutely no ability to counterattack.

Enemy Reinforces Three Army Divisions

(Central News Agency) The enemy forces in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas have fallen into a situation of exhaustion and lack of strength. The time of their destruction cannot be far off. The enemy has been in a passive position in the battles on this line from the beginning, constrained by our superior forces and unable to reverse the battle situation. Now, the enemy wants to resolve the crisis in the Shanghai battle situation, so it has reinforced Shanghai with three army divisions, hoping to land, contain the battle situation, and reverse its tragic position. In recent days, they have attempted to land at various ports in the lower reaches of our Yangtze River and along the coast of Nanhui, but have been repulsed by our army, suffering extremely heavy losses. According to special military dispatches, our reinforcements have arrived at key points along the coast and the river, and their strength is extremely strong. Although the enemy wants to fight to the death and open a bloody path, it is unable to cross the line.

Enemy Replaces Matsui as Commander-in-Chief

The Central News Agency reports that due to the disastrous defeat in Shanghai, the enemy army has transferred three divisions from Japan to reinforce Shanghai, and has appointed General Iwane Matsui as commander-in-chief. In recent days, they have attempted to land along our rivers, but have been severely beaten by us. The enemy's casualties have been unprecedented since the start of the war. Even a regimental commander has been killed. The enemy army's unfavorable start has greatly weakened its morale.

Enemy Warships Bombard Pudong on the Huangpu River

Enemy warships in the Huangpu River opened fire on our Pudong positions around 4:00 AM yesterday morning. We immediately retaliated with heavy artillery. Then, around noon, our [redacted] artillery positions again used heavy artillery to bombard enemy warships in the Huangpu River and enemy positions in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Enemy warships in the Huangpu River again bombarded our Pudong positions at 9:50 PM last night. Our army calmly retaliated, and the artillery battle stopped after about 20 minutes. At 11:30 PM, the enemy warships resumed firing, and the two sides again bombarded each other. The artillery fire continued intermittently until 1:30 AM this morning, when it finally stopped.

Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Strafes Refugees

(Central News Agency) Several enemy aircraft wantonly bombed the Pudong and Nanshi areas again yesterday morning (the 25th) and strafed our refugees at low altitude.

Furthermore, in the Pudong area, enemy aircraft have been bombing and killing innocent civilians for days. Yangjing was hit by two bombs, killing and injuring more than 20 people. Casualties also frequently occurred in areas such as Lan Ni Du and Yang Jia Du. As a result, residents belonging to the Yangjing district (the Yangjing district includes Yangjing, Qichangzhan, Lan Ni Du, and Yang Jia Du) fled overnight for the past two days, seeking refuge to the south. Those on the road, old and weak, unable to travel due to illness, died everywhere, a truly pitiful sight. A reporter's investigation of Yangjing Town revealed that not only was there no one to be found, even chickens, dogs, and livestock were extremely rare, a veritable catastrophe. On the other hand, the Tangqiao district, located in the southern Huangpu area, which lacked markets and consisted mostly of farmers, was originally a safe rear area after the port of the 16 Shupu was closed. However, the enemy consistently followed its policy of creating chaos. During the day, aircraft flying over the Huangpu River dropped bombs from time to time, targeting slightly repaired houses. At night, artillery fire also often fell on the area, causing innocent villagers to suffer. Therefore, the villagers all fled to the Nanhui area, walking at least twenty miles. Their pitiful state was heartbreaking. Also, yesterday afternoon and at 9:00 AM today, Pudong and Nanshi were bombed by enemy aircraft. The casualties included the Shenggia Long Tin Foil Shop in Pudong, which was destroyed by bombs yesterday, killing the shop owner, a passerby, and a dog. Today, three people were killed near Gaochang Temple in Nanshi, all of whom were coolies and poor people.

Major Fires in Nanshi and Pudong

The day before yesterday morning, the enemy aircraft bombed the vicinity of Gaochang Temple in Nanshi. The shanty towns and civilian houses near Guangdong Street and the riverside docks were all set on fire by the bombs. The fire spread until evening before being extinguished. In the Hongkou area, civilian houses near Wusong Road, Broadway Road, and Huishan Road also caught fire yesterday morning. The Nichi-Sei Company's warehouse in Zhangjia Bang, Pudong, also caught fire at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The fire was extremely fierce. With the help of the southeast wind, the sky over the Huangpu River was filled with black smoke, and the fire had not been extinguished by evening.

Enemy Wounded and Corpses Transported Back to Japan

The enemy transport ship Nojima, anchored at the Zhaoshangju North Wharf, and the enemy transport ship Chichibu Maru, anchored at the Zhaoshangju Central Wharf, carrying a large number of Japanese refugees, wounded soldiers, and corpses, a total of more than two thousand, left the port one after another at 12:10 PM and 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon to return east.

### Wusong Becomes a Scorched Earth

Fierce Battle Lasts for 51 Hours; Residents' Houses Burned Down, Unspeakable Cruelty

Two Houses, Two Chinese

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Since the enemy army began concentrating warships and intense artillery fire in the middle of Saturday night, and a large squadron of enemy aircraft bombed in an attempt to cover the landing of infantry, our army fought valiantly to meet them. The fierce battle lasted for 51 hours. The entire town of Wusong was almost completely destroyed. Yesterday, the Longshan transport ship, flying the Italian flag, entered the port of Wusong at 9:00 AM and arrived in Shanghai at 12:00 PM. According to the ship's crew members, the Longshan entered the port at 9:00 AM, and the artillery fire at the mouth of the Huangpu River had ceased. The ship sailed along the Huangpu River to Shanghai. What they saw was that from Wusong to the power plant on Jungong Road, only two houses were somewhat intact. The rest of the houses were almost completely destroyed. The ship's crew members also said that from Wusong to Yangshupu, along the riverbank, they only saw two Chinese people on the riverbank, searching and feeling around as if catching fish. The ship's crew later witnessed these two people being spotted by the enemy army, who, without asking the reason, immediately shot and killed them with a burst of gunfire. The cruelty of the situation was indescribable.

Crimson Flames Soaring, Fire Raging

Reliable sources state that the Japanese troops who landed on the beach at the Wusong Zhanghua Bang Railway Factory Wharf were completely eliminated by 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Enemy warships fired sparsely. According to an official from a certain organization who came to Shanghai, from 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 24th to early in the morning of this day, more than a dozen enemy aircraft wantonly bombed all night, dropping more than a hundred bombs. The number of residents' houses destroyed was countless, and the cruelty was indescribable. The two major buildings of Yong'an Yarn Factory on Yunzao Road and the Great China Paper Mill across the river were hit by bombs and caught fire, with crimson flames soaring and the fire raging fiercely. The losses were no less than tens of millions. Furthermore, according to someone who came to Shanghai from Luodian, more than 300 enemy soldiers who landed at Beichuan Sha Shidongkou the day before yesterday initially fled to the Shengqiao area. Around 11:00 AM, they had reached Luodian City and were deployed along various main roads, searching pedestrians and burning houses. In the afternoon, they concentrated at the Jade Emperor Temple. When our ×× division heard the news and rushed to the scene, they immediately surrounded and annihilated the enemy. None of the enemy soldiers escaped. Therefore, yesterday, our army completely recovered the coastal areas such as Wusong, Shizi Lin, and Beishidong, and there was no trace of the enemy. Heavy troops were also dispatched to garrison them. From now on, although enemy warships are lined up on the sea in those areas, it will be difficult for them to cross the line.

### Large Amount of Military Supplies Found in the Ri-Hua Cotton Mill

A large amount of military supplies was found by our army in the Ri-Hua Cotton Mill in Lujiazui, Pudong, the day before yesterday. It is now known that hundreds of boxes of guns, artillery, and ammunition, four anti-aircraft guns, and a disassembled aircraft were also seized in another warehouse the night before last. Compared to what was seized before, the bullets alone amounted to more than 1,000 boxes. It is estimated that the total value of these military supplies is more than one million yuan, which were probably stored by the Japanese army for use when they invaded our Pudong. Our side confiscated everything and transported it to the interior overnight. The Japanese army, upon hearing the news, was greatly alarmed and immediately sent several aircraft to scout the Pudong area yesterday morning.

### Our Army Advancing at Nankou

Fighting on the Jinpu Railway Line Remains Fierce; Enemy Retreats from Liangwangzhuang to Chaomidian; Part of Our Army Arrives at Yangliuqing

[Nanjing] Military news: Our army has concentrated on defending the high ground of the Juyong Pass in the Nankou area, and its defenses are extremely solid.

[Jinan] The enemy army in Jinghai has retreated due to the rear route to Yangliuqing being cut off, so there are only eighty to ninety people left. Enemy aircraft scouted Chen Guancun and Tang Guancun, dropping one bomb and being repelled. (Special dispatch from the 25th)

[Jinan] This morning, the enemy army attacked thirty to forty li northeast of Chen Guancun and was repelled. The enemy army in Jinghai City only has eighty to ninety people, and the station has thirty to forty people. Our [redacted] brigade has advanced from Chen Guancun. It is reported that part of our army has arrived at Yangliuqing, cutting off the enemy's rear route. (Special dispatch from the 25th)

[Nanjing] News from transportation circles: The fighting on the Jinpu Railway line remains fierce. Due to the continuous heavy rain, low-lying areas have become marshes, so the Japanese army is transporting large numbers of wooden boats for use. On the 25th, many Japanese soldiers left Tianjin. There are large numbers of refugees near Duliu and Jinghai, who boarded boats to Tianjin on the 25th. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)

[Guihua] Near Guojiazhuang on the PingSui Railway line, a small group of enemy plainclothes bandits was discovered a few days ago attempting to sabotage railway traffic. After our army's continuous strict search and suppression, they have now been completely annihilated and cleared. All road and telecommunications traffic is smooth. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)

[Baoding] The enemy in Liangwangzhuang has now retreated to the vicinity of Chaomidian and is being surrounded and dealt with by our army. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)

[Guihua] After our army recovered Shangdu, Jiabus, and other places, enemy aircraft have been constantly flying to drop bombs. However, our defenses are tight, and the losses are minimal. Our troops launching from eastern Sui have advanced to the city of Zhangbei. A part of the Japanese army reinforcing Zhangbei was cut off from communication by our army and severely beaten, and the enemy could not withstand it and retreated again on the 22nd. The Japanese and puppet troops in Zhangbei City are now in an isolated state. Although the enemy still has small units reinforcing Guyuan and other places, they cannot exert their effectiveness because of our army's heavy interception everywhere. On the Nankou front, there was fierce fighting on the 22nd. The Japanese army attacking Nankou was originally two brigades, and three brigades of reinforcements have now arrived. On the night of the 21st, our army boldly launched an attack with superior fresh troops, and on the 22nd, it inflicted a major blow on the enemy. The enemy retreated after suffering heavy losses, and our army's advance was extremely smooth. The enemy attacking Yongding also suffered a disastrous defeat on the 22nd. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and attack, and a small part of the Japanese army was surrounded. In total, our army achieved its greatest victory on the front line of the PingSui Railway on the 22nd. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)

[Guihua] Three enemy aircraft flew to Zhangjiakou at 7:30 PM on the 22nd and dropped more than a dozen bombs near the East Station. Then, nine reconnaissance planes reconnoitered and circled in the high air over Zhangyuan for about half an hour before flying to Zhangbei. Also, an enemy bombing aircraft dropped three bombs in Xinghe County at 8:35 AM on the 22nd. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)

[Tianjin] According to a statement by the Japanese military authorities, Chinese and Japanese troops have engaged in fierce fighting in Jinghai, south of Tianjin, and the Japanese army has begun attacking the Chinese army's positions on the Jinpu Railway. Tianjin has had misty rain for many days, and the Hebei Plain has become a marsh. On the Nankou front, mountain floods have broken out, and the trenches have been flooded. Therefore, during the misty rain, all battles have been suspended except for occasional aircraft reconnaissance. Now that the rain has stopped, the battles have resumed. After the Chinese army moved east, most of them concentrated on the Jinpu Railway, and are now arrayed on the west bank of the Yongding River, determined to prevent the Japanese army from crossing the river. It is heard that the Chinese army is concentrated on the Gu'an-Pingbao Highway, crossing the Yongding River there. The river has risen very high due to the heavy rain for many days, so it is extremely difficult to cross by wading. At the same time, according to eyewitnesses, soldiers and military supplies are being transported from transport ships near Tanggu, landing in a steady stream. The ground there is muddy and difficult to navigate due to the rain, and the soldiers and horses are moving through it in a very embarrassed state. The highway from Dagu to Tianjin has become a muddy river due to the rain and the continuous transportation of military supplies by the Japanese army. It is widely believed in Tianjin that even if a major flood does not occur, the roads in the area, which are not covered with asphalt, will probably not be usable for several weeks. (Reuters dispatch from the 25th, via Central News Agency)

Authorities Encourage Stores to Open; Export of White Rice and Flour Prohibited

[Qingdao] The Rotary Club and the Lions Club issued a statement to several newspapers in Shanghai, saying that the radio station broadcast a message on Monday night that the situation in Qingdao was critical. This statement must be firmly denied. Both the Chinese and Japanese authorities are now united in their desire to prevent the occurrence of incidents. The representatives committee is currently working hard to ensure the safe transport and distribution of food. Although thousands of tourists are currently unable to return to Shanghai, there are adequate military forces here to protect them. (Reuters dispatch from the 25th, via Central News Agency)

[Qingdao] The tense situation in Qingdao has eased slightly. After hearing news of a food shortage, the municipal government sent personnel to investigate and learned that the city has enough buckwheat flour stored to last for six months.

Current Commentary

### Efforts People Should Make in Wartime

— Appropriate

The current war is a great national liberation war. Our nation's soldiers and civilians are determined to resist until the end. This war cannot be stopped until the invading troops of Japanese imperialism have withdrawn from our national territory.

Precisely because of this, all of our compatriots should prepare for a long-term war. Everyone should fulfill their respective responsibilities in this war. However, most of our compatriots are inevitably confused and panicked by the onset of a major war due to their lack of knowledge. This hinders the prospects of the war effort. Intellectuals from all over the country should quickly unite to assist the Party and government authorities in guiding and organizing them, turning them into a great force in the war of resistance.

We know that in recent years, the government's implementation of the Baojia system and military training has already achieved considerable results. However, the personnel handling Baojia affairs in various regions do not have a full understanding of the nature of modern warfare and the significance of this national war of resistance. During this war, the effectiveness of the Baojia system still seems insufficient. Moreover, local Party headquarters, educational institutions, and professional organizations do not seem to maintain close cooperation with the Baojia organizations. How to ensure that the Baojia system exerts its full effectiveness in wartime and becomes the foundation of popular organization is something that intellectuals in various regions should strive for first.

Secondly, since this war is a long-term and arduous struggle for our entire nation, we must not be complacent due to a local victory, nor should we be discouraged by a temporary setback. We must maintain unwavering courage for a long time to achieve final victory. Therefore, in addition to providing strong assistance to the front-line troops in various aspects, the people in the rear must also devote themselves to various production and construction efforts in the inland, so that all the necessities of life can be self-sufficient. This is a necessary condition for maintaining the ability to resist the war. At a time when the flames of war have destroyed Shanghai's industrial areas and millions of workers have been displaced, inland production and construction are particularly urgent to resettle these urban unemployed workers. However, production and construction require considerable funds and sound planning. Under the government's effective control of national finance, it seems that there is still a way to make capitalists provide funds. What is hoped for is that outstanding individuals from the industrial and commercial sectors in various regions, with their knowledge and experience, will quickly formulate plans for wartime production and construction based on local conditions. With the cooperation of the government and capitalists, they should actively promote it, ensuring that the country's production capacity is not severely affected by the war.

In addition to promoting production, the people must also do their best to reduce the consumption of all materials. Because the military consumption of domestic materials is very large during wartime. For every point that the people reduce consumption, the military will increase its strength by one point. Therefore, all extravagant old habits in society must be thoroughly eliminated during wartime. This is also something that people above the middle class should strive for.

### The U.S. Does Not Abandon Treaty Obligations Regarding the Sino-Japanese War

Roosevelt's Confidant Goes to Britain and France for Talks. Japan Still Quibbles Over Hull's Declaration.

[New York] Secretary of State Hull advised China and Japan yesterday not to engage in war. The New York Times commented on this, saying, "The Secretary of State has always maintained that the obligations accepted by the signatories of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact should be strictly observed. This position has not changed to this day. In short, U.S. foreign policy still aims to protect China's independence and territorial integrity." (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

[Washington] Under Secretary of State Welles is scheduled to travel to Britain and France tomorrow aboard the British mail ship "Queen Mary." This morning, Welles went to the White House to see President Roosevelt and had a long discussion. The President has decided to maintain an open door policy towards China and has ordered Welles to inform the governments of the relevant countries in Europe. Welles is expected to stay in Europe for four weeks, nominally for a private vacation trip, and will travel to southeastern France. He does not intend to stay long in Paris and London, but diplomatic circles here believe that Welles' trip has important political significance. Welles is considered a confidant of the President and cannot leave Washington for a moment when the situation is tense. Although he has long intended to travel to Europe, he has repeatedly postponed it due to the tense international situation. The current tension in the Sino-Japanese situation, in the view of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, is unprecedented in the past five years. However, Welles is taking time out to go to Europe at this time, and it goes without saying that his purpose is to explain the U.S. view to the governments of Britain and France. In addition, the general public attaches great importance to the statement made by Secretary of State Hull yesterday. Hull firmly stated that 'the lives, property, and interests of American citizens in China must be protected,' and said that the United States is willing to do everything possible to end the current dispute between China and Japan as soon as possible. Even if the governments of China and Japan do not actually follow this advice, Hull has already made it clear that although the principle of the open door to China has been damaged by Japan, the United States will still firmly maintain it. This statement is extremely important. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull said in an interview with reporters today that, with regard to American citizens in Shanghai, the State Department is currently studying methods of protection to prevent them from being threatened by hunger and disease. A large portion of the $500,000 in emergency funds approved by Congress last week will be allocated to relief efforts for refugees after consultation with officials from the American consulate in China and the Red Cross. When asked by a reporter whether the government would force American citizens in Shanghai to withdraw if the warring troops entered the public concessions, Hull replied that he had not received any official recommendations from American officials in Shanghai. It is said that Hull's move to ask China and Japan not to engage in war contains four intentions, of which three can be said, namely ㊀ exerting moral pressure on China and Japan to promote a peaceful resolution of the dispute, ㊁ giving a final warning to China and Japan before implementing the neutrality law, and ㊂ alleviating the increasing domestic pressure. President Roosevelt declared that he had read Secretary of State Hull's statement asking China and Japan for a ceasefire and expressed his deep sympathy. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

[Tokyo] Regarding Secretary of State Hull's request that China and Japan cease hostilities, the official side here has not commented on it, but political circles say that 'no war has broken out between China and Japan.' This is because the Japanese government does not recognize that it has declared war on China, and the clashes between the two sides are merely an accidental event. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

[Tokyo] Regarding the proposal for a neutral zone in Shanghai, it is said that Japan's position remains unchanged, that is, the Japanese government cannot entrust the protection of its 30,000 overseas Chinese and its huge investments to other countries. Furthermore, the Japanese government believes that an indispensable condition for resolving the Shanghai incident is that China must fully comply with the 1932 ceasefire agreement. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

### British Cabinet Holds Second Meeting

To Discuss the Far East Situation

[London] British Prime Minister Chamberlain met with Foreign Secretary Eden and Halifax, who was acting Foreign Secretary during Eden's vacation, for two and a half hours this morning to discuss the Far East crisis, paying particular attention to the Shanghai incident, and decided to continue the discussion this afternoon. It is learned that Chamberlain's return to London this time was specifically to discuss the situation in the Far East, and he is now scheduled to go to Scotland tonight for vacation, where he will stay at the King's Balmoral Estate villa. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

[London] The National Executive Committee of the Labor Party issued a statement today, fiercely criticizing Japan's aggression against China, and requested that the British government, together with other member states of the League of Nations and countries that have signed treaties with China, especially the United States, take necessary measures to ensure that Japan respects international law and the rights stated in these treaties. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

[London] British newspapers continued to discuss the war between China and Japan today. The Conservative Party's Morning Post stated that, according to information received by the U.S. government from the Far East, there is little hope for an early end to the war between China and Japan, because the Japanese military seems to be willing to pay any price to achieve further victories in China. With Japan's stubborn attitude, the British government's proposal to neutralize Shanghai is unlikely to be realized. The Liberal Party's News Chronicle stated that 'Japan is now plundering China and threatening world peace. The reason for this is that the British government abandoned China in 1932 without cooperating with the United States. The United States has learned from the past and will certainly treat the proposal to cooperate with Britain with caution. We are now reaping the consequences of what Sir John Simon, the former British Foreign Secretary, sowed five or six years ago. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

### Opinions on International Intervention in the Sino-Japanese Incident Have Not Yet Been Unified

France is the Most Active, Britain is Only Anxious, the U.S. is Still Watching, Germany and Italy are Neutral

[Geneva] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, France was the first to express a cautious and vigilant attitude, hoping to protect its interests in China and Vietnam, and advocated that France, Britain, and the United States unite and, if necessary, intervene effectively. Other countries have also made statements. Today, French newspapers reported that Britain intends to establish a common attitude among major European and American countries to force Japan to respect foreign interests, because the recent Shanghai incident has caused anxiety in the British business and financial circles. The United States' attitude expresses sympathy for China, recognizing China as an innocent victim, and the implementation of the U.S. neutrality law will be a huge loss to U.S. business, as Japan is an important customer of the United States. Therefore, the majority of public opinion favors a policy of non-intervention, while paying attention to and hoping for future progress with concern. Germany initially adopted a strictly neutral attitude, but has recently changed slightly. Official newspapers favor Japan, believing that if the Soviet Union aids the Chinese army and the Sino-Japanese conflict cannot be localized, Germany will have to choose between the German-Japanese agreement and the future possibilities of the Chinese market to determine its position. Italy will remain neutral in the foreseeable future, and in order to improve Anglo-Italian relations, it will not hesitate to participate in the joint actions of Britain, the United States, and France, even if it is not approved by the German government. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

[London] The Daily Telegraph's Rome dispatch stated that a large detachment of Italian troops has departed from Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, for the port of Massawa, where they will board ships and go to Shanghai to increase the strength of the troops stationed in Shanghai. The heavy losses of life and property in Shanghai have aroused serious attention from the Italian government and business community. Although the Italian government and the public express sympathy for Japan because Japan and Germany have signed an anti-communist agreement, they feel that Japan's war against China is an unexpected and painful event. Japan will find that its adventurous behavior in China is an extremely difficult task that wastes its strength and only makes the Soviet Union relatively stronger. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Rome] The financial advisor to the Chinese National Government, Stefano, the former Italian Minister of Finance, has returned to his country from China. On the way, he wrote an article, which was published in the local Stampa newspaper, stating that the scope of the war between China and Japan will expand, China's resistance force has increased compared to the past, and the process of China's unification will also be accelerated. There is no doubt that China will become a great, new, civilized, and strong country. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

### 470 Million Yuan Trade Contract Canceled

The Economic Losses of Militaristic Countries are Serious

A Central News Agency reporter recently learned from reliable sources in the business community that trade contracts worth 470 million yuan ordered by our country's business community from the Japanese side have been completely cancelled since the outbreak of the Shanghai war. From this amazing figure, it can be seen that the effectiveness of our country's movement to boycott Japanese goods, promote national loans, and not buy or sell private goods has been minimal over the years. At the same time, it can also be seen that the economic losses suffered by militaristic countries are serious.

### The Anti-Enemy Support Association Convened a Discussion Meeting of Representatives from Various Groups Yesterday

Representatives of Various Committees Reported on the Progress of Their Work. The Entire Assembly Observed a Moment of Silence for the Martyred Soldiers and the Deceased Civilians.

In order to report on its work, solicit opinions, and promote support work, the Municipal Anti-Enemy Support Association convened a discussion meeting of representatives from various groups on the afternoon of the 24th. A total of 57 representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, Red Cross Society, YMCA, Cultural Salvation Association, Wartime Service Corps of the Education Sector, Shanghai Branch of the Women's Comforting Frontline Soldiers Association, and Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps attended. The presidium of the Support Association elected Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, and Huang Yanpei as chairmen. First, Wang Xiaolai delivered an opening speech and reported on the organization and general situation of the work of the Support Association. Then, representatives of various committees reported. Luo Qinghua reported that the Fundraising Committee had already collected 570,000 yuan in donations, and the total amount, including the pledged but unpaid amount from various trade associations, was over one million yuan. This money will be remitted to the Military Affairs Commission in its entirety, while the Support Association's own expenses will be raised separately. Jin Runxiang reported that the Supply Committee had already supplied goods worth approximately 100,000 yuan, and goods worth approximately 110,000 yuan had been ordered. For donations, there were already more than 100,000 sacks of jute alone. Pan Gongzhan reported that the Relief Committee had established 129 shelters, accommodating more than 43,800 refugees. Including those run by various fellow-countrymen associations, a total of more than 100,000 people were accommodated, with monthly expenses for food and transportation of approximately 120,000 yuan (limited to those run by the committee). Efforts are currently being made to send them back to their hometowns. Pang Jingzhou reported that the Medical Relief Committee had established more than a dozen wounded soldier hospitals and one field hospital, with a total of 3,300 beds. The monthly expenses are over 90,000 yuan. In the future, for each additional wounded soldier, only medical and food expenses will cost approximately 50 cents per person per day. Now that the front line has expanded, the number of beds is gradually becoming insufficient. It is hoped that all sectors will provide assistance. Xu Peihuang reported that the Transportation Committee had supplied more than 200 trucks and tens of thousands of gallons of gasoline. Subsequently, Shan Tongxing and Bai Zhufan reported in detail on the work of the Propaganda Committee, the Technical Committee, and the Wartime Knowledge Training Institute. After the reports of the various committees, Zhang Yi, a representative of the Salvation Association of the Education Sector, reported on the organization and work of the association, and advocated that various groups should maintain close contact to avoid duplication of work, and that Shanghai, as the economic and cultural center of the country, should lead the country in support work. Hu Yuzhi, a representative of the Cultural Salvation Association, reported on the association's international propaganda efforts. Representatives of various women's groups, including Jin Guangmei, Huang Dinghui, and Hu Lanqi, reported that they had promoted the donation movement, the sewing movement, and the holding of relief training, with more than 1,000 trainees. Subsequently, Wang Zaoshi, Zou Taofen, and Shen Hannian continued to speak, generally advocating that various salvation groups should register with the Support Association and submit a list of members and staff in order to allocate and adjust work. At the same time, the Support Association should designate a time and place to establish regular contact with representatives of various groups, and each group should report on its work to the Support Association in writing once every two weeks. Finally, the chairman led all the representatives to observe a three-minute silence to mourn the martyred soldiers and the deceased civilians. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.

### The Central Bank Fully Exchanges Subsidiary Coin Notes

Sufficient for Circulation

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously sent a letter to the issuing banks requesting them to issue more subsidiary coin notes to stabilize the exchange rate, etc. This was reported in a previous issue. According to the investigation, the Central Bank fully exchanged one-yuan notes and subsidiary coin notes before the outbreak of the Shanghai war, which was sufficient to meet the needs of the market. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, during the period when banks were closed, money shops were also closed, and there was a shortage of small notes in the market. Therefore, exchange shops took the opportunity to make profits by charging a premium. Now that the banks and money shops have been reopened for more than a week, the Central Bank has extended the time for exchanging one-yuan notes and subsidiary coin notes and is fully exchanging them. The number of people going to the bank to exchange money has decreased compared to before the war, which shows that there are already enough one-yuan notes and subsidiary coin notes in circulation in the market. However, the bank still fully exchanges them every day.

### The Third Meeting of the People's Food Regulation Committee

It was resolved to pass, and the Silver Industry Association and Grain Industry Association have been requested to inform the banks and money shops separately.

### To Appoint Valuation Committee Members

In order to ensure fair rice prices and prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating and hoarding, the Municipal People's Food Regulation Committee has organized a Valuation Committee and appointed 11 members from the Bureau of Social Affairs, Bean and Rice Trade, Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry, Rice Shop Industry, Flour Industry, and Rice Brokers. In the future, all rice price increases and decreases will be evaluated by the committee.

Rice Types and Prices

The Shanghai Municipal People's Food Regulation Committee issued a notice stating: ㊀ After each rice selling point fills out the rice request form, the committee will allocate and transport the rice. After the rice is delivered, each rice selling point must sell the rice according to the grade and price filled in on the delivery slip, and must not increase or decrease the price without authorization. However, the sale of stale rice must be priced according to the current day's price. ㊁ From today onwards, the selling price of rice at the rice selling points is divided into three grades of Japonica rice, with each grade priced at 40 cents, and three grades of Indica rice, with each grade priced at 40 cents. ㊂ From today onwards, the types of rice sold at the rice selling points are divided into four types, and the types and prices are listed below: A.

### Telegram from Xuzhou Compatriots in Shanghai to Commander Wang Jingjiu

Outstanding Achievements Cover the World, Offering Grain Dares to Support the Rear

The Xuzhou compatriots in Shanghai, including Wang Xiangchen, former Commander of the National Revolutionary Army and Commander of the Guide Garrison, and Lu Yinquan, Cui Buwu, Su Shaoqing, Lou Ziming, Chen Zhusheng, Zhou Linwu, Wang Ailin, Luo Shenliang, and hundreds of others, because Commander Wang Jingjiu is from Xuzhou and has deep ties to his hometown, have initiated the ‘Xuzhou Compatriots in Shanghai Comforting the Anti-Japanese Soldiers Comforting Group’. They have raised funds to purchase military supplies, food, relief supplies, etc., to comfort those at the front lines. Preparations have been completed. Wang Xiangchen and Lu Yinquan have been appointed as the chief and deputy leaders of the group, respectively. They will depart soon to offer comfort. Xuzhou compatriots who wish to join the comforting effort can sign up at the Datong Company on Lao Yong'an Street in the French Concession at any time. It is recorded that the telegram from the group to Commander Wang is as follows: ‘To Commander Wang and all the soldiers at the front lines: When the savage Japanese invaded, the Battle of Shanghai resumed. Your army, under your command, bravely embarked on a long expedition, facing the stubborn enemy with divine might. Triumphant news arrived frequently, and meritorious achievements were made repeatedly. They seized the naval drill ground at the beginning of the battle and captured the Huishan Wharf in a bloody battle. Their courage in resisting is no less than that of their predecessors. Their outstanding achievements cover the world. We are all part of the nation, sharing its glory and disgrace. We should carry our bows to the front, and offer grain to support the rear. We are purchasing supplies and will present them soon. We anticipate that on the Jiang River, we will witness the annihilation of the Japanese in the Pudong area.

### Important Speech by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce

All Industries Should Expedite Resumption of Business Within Their Respective Scope, and Workers Should Maintain the Minimum Standard of Living

Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, yesterday formally issued the following statement: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all citizens have been loyal, courageous, and energetic, expressing a unified spirit of resistance against the enemy. Our fellow businessmen have donated and raised funds, providing transportation and support. Their patriotic enthusiasm has been unmatched. The Chamber has also taken measures to assist important industries in the city to resume business in an orderly manner, such as banks, money shops, rice stores, and pawnshops. The order has gradually stabilized, and the market has been slightly alleviated. Further efforts depend on the brave soldiers at the front lines fighting valiantly and the people in the rear continuing to produce. Only then can there be long-term resistance, and only then can there be a final victory. Therefore, as far as factories are concerned, those in the war zone should do their best to find ways to relocate. Those in safe areas should set a time limit and start work as soon as possible. As for shops, in addition to those providing food, clothing, housing, and transportation, which are necessary for people's livelihood and must resume business as much as possible, other industries should also expedite resumption of business within their respective scope, so that goods can circulate and people's hearts can be stabilized. As for partners, friends, and employees, we should all share weal and woe. No matter how difficult it is, we should strive to maintain the minimum standard of living. This will not only reduce the pain of unemployment but also increase the power to resist the enemy. For those whose economic capacity is insufficient, it is hoped that they will reduce salaries and share the minimum standard of living. What day is today? The life and death of the nation are hanging by a thread. We live together, and we die together. The boundaries of the past, the divisions between labor and capital, have disappeared with the sound of gunfire. What lies before us is only the entire nation, the entire nation uniting to resist foreign aggression and cooperate to survive. All my fellow businessmen should understand this intention.

### Japanese Cotton Weaving Industry Will Lose British Territory and South American Markets

[London] A Menchester Visiting Officer of The Financial Times claimed today that several self-governing regions and South American markets, which used to sell Japanese cloth, have requested Lancashire spinning companies to quote prices for ordering, because they fear that the Sino-Japanese war will be prolonged and Japan will not be able to supply goods in a timely manner.

### Japanese Plane Bombards American Hospital, American Consul Telegraphed to the United States

Sixty Patients Were Present During Bombing

The North China Daily News reports that the American Consulate General in Shanghai has received a telegram from Miss Fry, the head nurse of the American-run Christian Hospital in Nantongzhou, stating that Japanese aircraft bombed the hospital on August 17th. All the staff members in the hospital were Americans and were fortunately safe.

### Our Army Fought Bloody Battle Overnight, Enemy Troops in Luodian Town Have Been Cleared

The Remaining Enemy Outside the Town Are Still Being Searched for and Intercepted. The Coastal Defense of Zhaopu is Tight, and the Enemy Has No Chance to Take Advantage. There Was Fierce Fighting Between the Two Sides in Chuansha This Morning.

In the past three days, the focus of the war has shifted to the coastal areas along the Yangtze River. Some enemy troops have achieved their goal of landing in several places, but our forces in Wusong, Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, Shizilin, Luodian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Liuhui, etc., have strong forces. When the enemy's position was unstable, they immediately attacked with all their strength. Our large reinforcements have arrived and are now taking a large encirclement formation, vowing to eliminate them. Except for Luodian Town, where there is still fierce fighting this morning, it will not be long before they can be annihilated. The rest of the areas are no longer a problem. As for the eastern part of Shanghai, although there has been no fierce fighting in recent days, there are still small contacts on the front line. Our army firmly defends its original defense, with confidence. It is estimated that there will be new developments in the entire war in three or two days.

### Enemy Troops in Luodian Town Have Been Resolved

Our Land and Air Forces Advance Together. It Is Not Difficult to Annihilate Them in a Short Time.

The enemy troops in Luodian Town have been completely resolved by our army. Now our side concentrates its forces and launches a fierce attack on the enemy troops entrenched outside the town. The enemy is in a desperate situation and will soon be resolved by us. According to the latest report from the front line, about two regiments of enemy troops invaded the area east of Luodian again and were fiercely resisted by our original garrison there, preventing them from advancing. At the same time, our side immediately dispatched a large army from □□ to □□ and actively advanced to reinforce it. Last night, all the reinforcements arrived in the area and closely connected with the front-line troops, gradually completing a three-sided encirclement. Since yesterday afternoon to this morning, the fighting between the two sides has been fierce. Dozens of enemy ships fired heavy artillery at the Zizhang area, and several aircraft dropped bombs in an attempt to prevent our reinforcements and destroy our positions. Our side also responded with heavy artillery. The gunfire continued all night. According to military sources, our army is strong, and the enemy is shocked. It is not difficult to annihilate them in a short time.

Shen Shi News Agency reports that since enemy General Matsui Iwane led three divisions of reinforcements to Shanghai to assist in the battle, he concentrated his main force at the mouth of Wusong and repeatedly attacked various strongholds since the 23rd, but were bravely repelled by our defending troops. Yesterday morning, they landed from Chuanshakou again and launched a fierce attack on our Luodian, hoping to create a new base of operations. Our army fought with them all day. According to sources from a military agency this afternoon, our heavy troops have now entered Chuanshakou, and the enemy near Luodian has had its retreat cut off by us. They are now surrounded by our army on all sides, and the remaining enemy can be completely destroyed.

Central News Agency: Yesterday morning, under the cover of aircraft and heavy artillery, the main enemy troops landed from Chuanshakou again and launched a fierce attack on our Luodian area. At the same time, a large number of enemy planes flew to bomb. From morning to noon, they did not stop. Although our army made heroic sacrifices, they defended to the death and waited for reinforcements, without retreating at all. Until about 3 PM, our main reinforcements rushed to the scene and immediately joined forces to attack the enemy. Bullets were used up, and bayonets were exhausted. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and was in a terrible state. That night, our army drove the enemy out of Luodian Town, and there was no trace of the enemy in the town. Our army immediately pursued the victory, and the fighting continues to this morning. The enemy's momentum has been exhausted, and the time of annihilation should not be far away.

### Remaining Enemy in Nanhui Completely Annihilated

After Several Hours of Fierce Fighting Yesterday, the Enemy Could Not Withstand It and Retreated to Their Original Location

At dawn yesterday morning, more than a thousand enemy troops landed in the Nanhui area under the heavy cover of enemy artillery fire. At that time, our defending troops in the area concentrated their firepower and launched a fierce attack. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy gradually could not withstand it and retreated to their original location. A part of the remaining enemy was heavily surrounded by us and was cleared out by noon today.

Military sources: In the Nanhui and Chuansha beach areas, since the enemy's landing failed on the 25th, in the past 24 hours, in addition to the enemy ships patrolling the coast, the thousand or so people who landed on the 25th were completely resolved by our army using the "luring the enemy deep" strategy, killing more than 700 enemy troops, and only one-tenth of them survived. After that, the enemy was terrified and has not dared to try again. Our army is now standing by in full battle array.

### Part of the Enemy Army Raids Liuhui

Our Army is Blocking and Striking Hard. There is No Trace of the Enemy in the Shizilin Area.

According to reliable reports, a part of the enemy army has been raided and landed in the Liuhui area, but the number of people is small. Our army is blocking and striking hard, and the fighting is also quite fierce. There is no trace of the enemy in the Shizilin area after it was wiped out by us. It is very quiet at the moment.

### Fierce Fighting Between the Two Sides in Chuansha This Morning

The Enemy Still Attempts to Raid This Morning. It is Still Being Annihilated.

On the Chuansha front, a small number of enemy troops took advantage of the fierce fighting on all roads yesterday morning and attempted to land near the beach there. They were immediately repelled by our army. Before long, enemy reinforcements arrived and resumed the invasion. The total number was no less than five or six hundred, and under the cover of enemy aircraft and heavy artillery, they launched a fierce attack on our army's position. Our army was prepared and immediately counterattacked. The two sides fought hand-to-hand for a long time. The enemy finally suffered a defeat and retreated. Afterwards, they invaded several times, but none of them succeeded. This morning, when dawn was breaking, the enemy army still attempted to raid, causing fierce fighting. The annihilation is still underway.

Also, according to news from Chuansha, a part of the enemy army landed last night. Our side has sufficient troops and a tight defense. The enemy army that landed there is now surrounded by us on three sides. There was fierce fighting at night, and by noon today, all of them had been driven back.

Central News Agency: About two or three hundred enemy troops landed in Chuansha yesterday morning. Our army often bravely fought back and the fighting was fierce. According to news received this morning, our army surrounded the enemy who landed in Chuansha last night and is annihilating them.

### The Enemy Has No Chance to Land in Zhaopu

Our Defense There Is Very Strict.

According to rumors, a part of the enemy army also attempted to land in the Zhaopu area, but according to military sources, our defense there is very strict and will never allow the enemy to have a chance to land.

### The Enemy Plots to Lift the Siege of the Eastern District

But It Is Still Surrounded by Our Army

It is confirmed that a part of the enemy army in the Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang areas is still relying on the maintenance of warships and artillery in the river and stubbornly resists, attempting to advance to the line of Jungong Road in order to lift the siege of the remaining enemy in Yangshupu in the eastern district, but our army is heavily surrounded and will seize the opportunity to strike hard. Although the enemy is stubborn, it is difficult to succeed.

### Big Fire in Jiading City After Bombing

Luodian Town Burns Down Almost Completely

According to refugees who have just arrived in Shanghai from Jiading, enemy planes often come to bomb the urban area of Jiading. In the area of the county chamber of commerce in the city, a fire broke out due to the enemy dropping incendiary bombs. There were also several fires outside the city, but the order in the city is still good. Most of the residents have taken refuge elsewhere, so there were no casualties. Luodian also caught fire again yesterday (the 25th) afternoon, and the whole town was almost burnt to ashes.

### Enemy Planes Chase Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Train

Passengers Leave the Train Completely Unharmed

This morning at about 8 AM, the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train that departed from Shanghai at 8:30 AM this morning could not pass through to Hanghzou. The other Shanghai-Zhabei special express trains at 1:30 PM and 6 PM and the Shanghai-Jinan through train at 5:30 PM will only be able to depart after the repairs are completed. This morning at about 9 AM, a Shanghai-Hangzhou car that departed from the South Station was followed by an enemy plane to outside Xin Zhuang Station. The car police saw that the situation was not good, so they immediately ordered the driver to stop the car and ordered the passengers to leave the car. Before long, the plane dropped a bomb, fortunately without hurting anyone.

Also, this morning at 9 o'clock, enemy planes dropped bombs behind the Huiyun Middle School.

This morning at 10 o'clock, an enemy plane bombed in Minhang.

### Enemy Plane Flies to Nanshi to Drop Bombs

Innocent Citizens Are Tragically Bombed to Death

This morning at about 9 o'clock, an enemy plane flew to Nanshi and dropped a bomb. Resident Chen He's family, 33 years old, and an unknown passerby were bombed to death. In addition, four people were seriously injured.

### Enemy Warships in the Huangpu River Are Very Weak

Our Planes Often Make Night Attacks and Drop Bombs, Enemy Warships Move Around to Avoid Danger

Enemy warships in the Hongkou area had a fierce artillery battle with our garrison in Pudong last night. The enemy sent most of its warships to Songkou, and the defenses here are weak. Fearing that our army in Pudong would take the opportunity to cross the river and attack the Japanese army's rear positions in Yangshupu and Hongkou, they fired to demonstrate. In fact, all the warships were extremely panicked. Our army took advantage of our planes making a night attack to bombard the ships with intensive artillery fire. The shells fell like rain, and the Japanese warships moved back and forth to avoid danger. The chaotic situation was indescribable. The gunfire did not stop until dawn.

### Enemy Carries Out a Massacre on Zhaofeng Road

According to a carpenter who fled from Zhaofeng Road, yesterday the enemy searched house to house in the Zhaofeng Road and Broadway Road area, forcibly ordering residents to move out, otherwise they would set fire to the houses. The residents, who were in a difficult situation, had no choice but to leave and prepare to move elsewhere. Unexpectedly, the enemy suddenly forbade it, forcibly ordering them to wait until a large number of people had gathered before they were allowed to leave. The residents had no choice but to gather at the outdoor intersection. When about two or three hundred people had gathered, the enemy immediately surrounded them and fired with machine guns, and they all died. The carpenter, because he was more alert, took advantage of the fact that the enemy was searching each household and the guards were not tight, and immediately fled, thus escaping the tiger's mouth and avoiding the disaster. The enemy's brutal and beastly behavior can be seen from this.

### More Than 3,000 Houses Were Destroyed in the Gaochangmiao Riverside Area

Enemy Planes Drop Incendiary Bombs to Start Fires, The Tragic Situation Is Too Horrible to Witness

Yesterday afternoon, after 1 o'clock, enemy planes bombed the Gaochangmiao riverside pier area and dropped incendiary bombs. The riverside pier area was originally a shantytown with more than 2,000 huts. Once a fire broke out, it could not be controlled immediately. The fire spread quickly, and the enemy planes indiscriminately dropped bombs, so the fire department could not rescue them. As a result, the fire was blazing and the smoke was everywhere. The order in Gaochangmiao was disrupted, and the remaining poor people had to flee. Among the lodgers in the shacks, there were no shortage of traitors who set fires, so the fire continued to burn to Tianzhutang Street and Lao Guangdong Street all the way to the tram station, the Liu Yanghe Pharmacy at 740 Bansongyuan Road, and the Wanchen Sauce Garden at 743 opposite it. (The Gaochangmiao Post Office was fortunately preserved.) A total of more than 3,000 houses were destroyed. Fortunately, it was daytime, and there were few casualties. When reporters went to investigate this morning, four Japanese planes were flying low and circling in the Gaochangmiao area.

### Nanjing Chromium Tragedy Was Caused by Japan

Our Embassy in England Received a Telegram

[London] Regarding the tragic bombing of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, the Chinese Embassy recently received a telegram from Nanjing stating that the explosives were not warship shells but airplane bombs. There were two yellow lines on the shell and Japanese markings. On the afternoon of the day of the incident, Japanese planes were bombing Pudong. The Japanese authorities have admitted this. As for Chinese planes, they did not take off at the time. Therefore, it is self-evident that the tragedy was caused by Japanese bombs. (Havas, Central News Agency, 25th)

### Dutch Overseas Chinese Donate 15,000

To Comfort the Front-Line Anti-Japanese Soldiers

Since our army bravely fought against the Japanese, people from all over have enthusiastically contributed to support the government. The Joint Relief Association of Charitable Organizations in this city recently received a telegram from the Overseas Chinese Association of the Netherlands donating 15,000 national currency to serve as a comfort to the anti-Japanese soldiers and to relieve the disaster.

### Foreigner Bridge Car Collision, Japanese Officer Seriously Injured

Two Westerners also Injured, Sent to Hospital for Treatment. At 9:30 this morning, a Japanese naval headquarters car was speeding along the Bund towards Broadway Road when, at the center of the Foreigner Bridge, three Westerners in their own car were driving south from Broadway Road. The Japanese car, due to excessive speed, could not stop in time, and the two cars collided head-on with a loud crash, destroying the machinery.

### Britain Decides to Take Positive Action on the Far East Situation

Roosevelt's Right-Hand Man Departs for Europe. Cooperation Between Britain and the United States Remains Uncertain

[London] Well-informed sources recently stated that the British government has decided that all actions regarding the Far East situation will be limited to protecting its own interests and the safety of its nationals and will no longer make diplomatic efforts to stop Japanese aggression against China. There are two reasons for this: (1) The British government's past efforts to mediate disputes between China and Japan have failed. (2) Isolationist elements are gradually gaining dominance in the United States, as can be seen from the U.S. plan to withdraw its nationals from Shanghai. Therefore, whether the United States can cooperate diplomatically with Britain is highly uncertain. However, it can be stated that Britain will definitely not follow the United States in withdrawing its nationals. If the British authorities in Shanghai request the government to continue sending troops to reinforce them, the government will comply at any time. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 25th)

(Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 25th)

### Brief Commentary

— Xiang

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the enemy has been trapped in the Yangshupu Zhabei area. Not only has it been unable to advance, but it is also showing signs of collapse. If there are no reinforcements, it will be annihilated soon. The enemy, seeing the unfavorable situation, has sent a large number of reinforcements. Knowing that the original war zone cannot be expanded, it has had to seek an outlet along the river and coastal ports. Therefore, the expansion of the future war situation is inevitable. This is also something that our military authorities have long planned for.

The opinions of various countries on the matter of intervening in the Sino-Japanese conflict are still not unified. France is the most active, Britain is merely anxious, and the United States is still watching. This is due to the different depths of interest of each country, or the differences in their own positions and national policies. Different attitudes are obvious. However, they all agree that Japan is an aggressive and militaristic country. Since the September 18th Incident, our country's psychology of relying on others has long passed. We can only repay the enemy with the four words "calmly resist" and have no time to consider the attitudes of various countries.

### Our Troops Recapture Shangdu; Japan Actively Reinforces Rehe in Recent Days

Part of Force Also Stationed in Duolun, Chabei; Puppet Troops Also Retreat East, Gathering on Border Between Rehe and Chahar

Zhangjiakou Dispatch: After the bandit-puppet troops in Chabei were reorganized into the puppet "Inner Mongolian Army" after being unified by Tong Chang (Li Shouxin), they underwent a long period of training, reorganization, and elimination. Although nominally nine divisions, they were actually only a mixture of the old Rehe security forces of Li Shouxin's troops (namely the current 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th divisions) and the Mongolian troops gathered by Prince De (namely the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th divisions and Zhuo Shihai's security forces), totaling only over ten thousand men. Since the Japanese side has decided to sacrifice the puppet troops in Chabei and focus on consolidating the Chabei plan, they have stationed Li Shouxin's direct descendants, Liu Jiguang, Yin Baoshan, Wang Zhenhua, Bao Zichen, and other four puppet divisions in the Shangdu Shangyi Nanhaogian area. Another order was issued to concentrate all of Yi Shaoxian's puppet 5th division in Pingding Fort, all of Bao Anpu's puppet 6th division in Baochang, and all of Bao Yueqing's puppet 8th division in Duolun. The above-mentioned puppet troops have already been deployed. As for Mu Kedengbao's puppet 7th division, the puppet Nite clan, and Jabu Temple, in addition to the puppet troops, there is a Japanese division trapped in the Fengning and Dagezhen areas of western Rehe.

As for the defensive works of the Japanese puppet troops, which are currently being rushed to completion, they are in the Fengning County, Huogezhen, Waimengouzi, and Shanghuangqi areas along western Rehe, where the situation is extremely tense. Those already completed in Chabei include the construction of solid defensive works from the Heihe River to Guyuan and Baochang. As for their combat plan, the puppet 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th divisions stationed in Shangdu, Shangyi, Zhangbei, and Nanhaogian areas are to be used as support troops. However, the Japanese puppet plan is not to make major sacrifices in this regard. If there is a war, the puppet commander will offer a slight resistance and plan to retreat entirely to Duolun and join forces with the puppet troops originally stationed in the Duolun Guyuan Pingding Fort area to defend to the death. This is the puppet army's official front line of defense. Therefore, a large amount of military supplies and food have long been stored in Duolun Pingding Fort and other places, preparing to resist persistently in these places.

On the 8th of this month, according to sources, the Japanese Kwantung Army has been dispatching large numbers of divisions to Rehe in recent days. The Kawahara Division, which has already been mobilized, is about to arrive in Chengde in its entirety, and more troops are continuing to arrive. What kind of troops and their numbers remain to be investigated in detail. The 4th Cavalry Brigade of Jishi Muroyoshi has also set off from Panyang to Chifeng. It is reported that after the troops gathered in Chifeng, a part of them will be transferred west to garrison Duolun in Chabei. At the same time, Zhou Yongqing, the puppet commander of the 4th District of Chengde, was appointed as "Commander of the Front Line." Zhou and his subordinate Liu Laiqing's four infantry regiments have gathered and are awaiting orders in the Fengning Dagezhen area of western Rehe. In addition, 24 new enemy planes have arrived at the Chengde airport for wartime use, including 20 bombers and 4 reconnaissance planes. Judging from the sudden and active increase in troops, it is certain that they have other ambitions. According to general observations, it is generally believed that the Japanese side, because its entrenched troops in Píng and Tianjin (Beiping and Tianjin) are hindered by a large number of troops to the south, and the Nankou garrison is attacking its rear, and because the Ping Sui Railway from Nankou to Jin Sui is the contact point for the traffic of the three provinces of Sui Jin and Chahar, increasing reinforcements can respond from one place to another, which is extremely convenient. Therefore, it deeply feels the danger of its troops now entrenched in Píng and Tianjin, so it has decided to increase troops in Rehe, attempting to invade Dushikou from Chicheng County, Liaoning Province, and to try to peek into Chicheng and Longguan in order to cut off the retreat route of our Nankou garrison. At the same time, in western Rehe and Chabei, it will strengthen the strength of bandits and puppets to prevent a sudden attack by the Jin Sui army. If the Japanese army's plan can succeed and be realized, it will not only exempt its entrenched troops in Píng and Tianjin from the disadvantage of being attacked on both sides, but also make eastern Hebei and northern Chahar, and even the entire territory of Chahar Province, connect with the puppet state of "Manchukuo". The viciousness of its intentions can be imagined.

According to people from outside the Pass, after the main force of the puppet troops in Chabei moved east to gather on the border between Rehe and Chahar, they have established contact with the Japanese puppet troops in the Fengning Jingpeng area of western Rehe. Duolun has now become the transportation hub of the Japanese puppet side and also the military center of the Japanese puppet side. Recently, the Rehe puppet army heard that there were a total of about one division led by Zhang Yizhe, who has defected from all of Chabei, stationed at the Heilongjiang River. There is also Gao Jiangong's division stationed in the Datai area (it is said that their numbers are all said to be from the Kwantung Army, and most of them are estimated to be from the three northeastern provinces). In addition, the nephew of Yi Shaoxian, commander of the puppet 5th division, was allowed to form a puppet army brigade. He has now established a puppet brigade headquarters in Pingding Fort and is sending people to recruit from all over, or forcibly drag strong men from various counties and force them to join the army. It is said that there are already more than 300 people. The guns and guns used are all supplied by the Japanese army and are completely in the style of sending Han Lianchun.

### Kunshan

Boatmen Enthusiastically Patriotic

Boatmen such as Zhou Guishu from the Dongmen Fu River have stated that in the face of national crisis, the masses should embrace the determination to sacrifice and save the country. In recent days, various transportation needs have required many boats. They gathered thirty-odd boats of all sizes and publicly elected Zhou Guishu, Yang Guozhi, Xu Lianke, Jiang Guirong, and others as representatives to meet with County Magistrate Wen and submit a list of the tonnage of each boat and the number of partners to the county government, stating their willingness to serve and await transportation orders to express their patriotism. County Magistrate Wen praised the boatmen for their enthusiasm in saving the country, which was truly commendable.

### Yangzhou

Enemy Goods Store Huaming Smashed

The Huaming Porcelain Store at Yuanmen Bridge in Yangcheng has been selling enemy goods and operating Anzhu mosquito incense at low prices, long resented by merchants of national goods. In the past, when checking smuggled goods, the store had several boxes. Suddenly, an enemy merchant came to the Chamber of Commerce to resist. At this time of tense resistance against the enemy, the store still openly sold enemy goods, which aroused the blood of patriotic youth. At 10:00 AM on the 20th, dozens of young people went to the store and destroyed and threw away the enemy goods on display, making a mess on the ground. For a time, onlookers blocked the road and applauded.

### Taixian

Prices Rise in Jiangbei

Due to the recent Shanghai war, prices in Taidong and other counties in Jiangbei have been rising steadily. In particular, kerosene, matches, and various foreign goods have become scarce due to the lack of sources from Shanghai, and prices have increased by 10-20% across the board. Because food prices are in the autumn grain harvest season, except for wheat, they have not risen significantly. In order to prevent merchants from raising prices and manipulating the market under false pretenses, the county government has issued a special order to the police organs in each district to strictly investigate and ban it, and to detain the merchants in question for investigation.

### Jiaxing

Controlling Price Gouging

The Jiaxing County Government, fearing that unscrupulous merchants might manipulate the prices of daily necessities due to the serious situation, has formulated methods and issued notices that all prices should be based on August 10th as the standard. If prices need to be increased, they must be verified and implemented. Unscrupulous merchants are not allowed to manipulate prices privately, and measures must be taken to stop boatmen from raising prices to take advantage of traffic.

### Xiaoshan

Downed Enemy Plane on Display

Our air force shot down an enemy plane in Tou Peng, Manshan Township, on the 15th. In addition to escorting the two enemy pilots to the district headquarters, the county government has ordered the local public security bureau to dismantle and transport the plane to the city for display at the county government starting from the 20th.

More Than 500,000 Refugees

From the 14th to the 18th, the Qiantang River ferry boats in Xiaoshan carried no less than 500,000 refugees. The overcrowding of boats and the large number of vehicles were beyond imagination. Those traveling from Xiaoshan to Shaoxing continued along the road without end, and the business of restaurants and food stalls increased tenfold. Also, the price of vehicles and boat fares increased fivefold compared to normal. On the 17th, the Yiyong police from the Xixing Zhuangding team were sent to suppress the situation and prevent high vehicle and boat fares. All evacuees were hired boats and escorted.

### Hefei

Five Han Traitors Captured

Near Chen Maoji in the northeast countryside, a group of people recently organized the Sanyi Religion, also known as the Bao Huang Party (Protect the Emperor Party), specializing in recruiting foolish followers and spreading false rumors to mislead the public. After investigation by the district office, it was found that it was actually a traitorous organization plotting against the government. Therefore, a team was dispatched to arrest five people and escort them to the county for strict interrogation. In addition, Zhao Rixin and others have recently been selling Rendan in various counties in northern Anhui. After investigation by the Dingyuan County Government, Zhao and others were suspected of being traitors. Zhao Rixin, Zhao Rijie, Yang Chuncai, Yang Ruilin, Lu Jiaxing, and other six people were arrested and escorted to Hefei for interrogation on the 19th.

### An Open Letter to Our Soldiers from a Swiss Miss

Praising Our Army's Strict Discipline and Attentive Hospitality

An open letter to Chinese soldiers from Swiss Miss Ross Cuffer, whose original text reads: "Before recalling my memories, please allow me, my brother 'Edward,' and my doorman 'Liu Ge' to express our deep gratitude to you for all the conveniences you have given us during our dangerous journey in the front line of Zhao Feng Road. After being given food, drink, and Chinese clothes by the kindness of the refugees and soldiers in the 'Qinhui' cotton mill, we met again and said goodbye. Then, a soldier with a letter from his general accompanied us to the North Railway Station, hoping to transfer to the concession from there. First, after leaving the cotton mill, we tried to cross the city center, but because the battle was fierce there, we turned to Jiangwan Road. After walking a few steps, we realized that it would be dangerous to continue along the railway, because Zhabei was being heavily bombed at that time. So we walked along Jiangwan Road again and met many admirable Chinese soldiers whose treatment of us was particularly attentive. That night, the moon was full, and we traveled and talked with the brave soldiers who accompanied us. At this time, my old doorman 'Liu Ge' acted as a translator. Before we knew it, we arrived in Zhenru at 2:30 AM. Because we were thirsty, we searched for teahouses everywhere but could not find any, because the doors were open but all closed. We arrived in Nanxiang late. If it were peacetime, we should have taken the road to Zhongshan Road. At that time, we followed Jungong Road and Nanmingxing Bailinan Road. I thought the last half hour of the journey seemed the longest, because this journey was often taken by us during our suburban travels, and it seemed shorter. My brother and I were very satisfied with the feelings we gained this time. I will never forget the Chinese soldiers who gave us kindness and courtesy. Respectable soldiers, admirable is your bravery and noble morality. Our feelings are as described above. Please extend my gratitude to you again." (Translated from the French Shanghai Daily, August 25, 1937)

### Brief Report on Rear Area Work

Relief

Refugees from the war zones are fleeing into the concessions in droves. Although various organizations and charitable groups have set up shelters to accommodate them, there is still a sense that there is not enough space for everyone. As a result, many refugees continuing to flee the war zones from areas such as Hongkou still face the hardship of having nowhere to settle. The situation is dire. Currently, refugees from the war zones are still arriving in large numbers, and it is hoped that all sectors will find ways to accommodate them as soon as possible.

Yesterday, the burial team of the Shanghai Relief Committee continued to collect and bury over eighty bodies from the Nanjing Road tragedy. Together with the previous burials, the total is over one hundred and fifty bodies, all transported to Rihui Port for burial. Furthermore, twenty-odd members from the first and second teams were dispatched to the war zone, together with the Buddhist monk rescue team, to engage in burying dead soldiers and civilians.

Since its establishment on the 14th, the Yuyao Native Place Association Shelter has accommodated over four hundred people and sent over five hundred people back to their hometowns. Therefore, the work is quite intense. It is also said that Messrs. Jiang Quanmao, Gao Peiliang, Qi Shaoqi, Xu Xiajun, and Zheng Wentong of the same association have all made substantial donations.

Repatriation

The Red Swastika Society has already begun repatriating refugees. The Society, having heard that the Shanghai Relief Society has several ships ready to transport refugees out of the country, consulted with the Relief Society and obtained ship tickets for the refugees. This morning, the Society dispatched a relief team to escort over five hundred refugees from the shelter to the Suzhou area.

At 4:00 PM yesterday, various Shanghai native place associations held a joint meeting at the Du Hall of the Pudong Native Place Association. Over thirty representatives from various native place associations attended to discuss issues related to relief and repatriation to their hometowns. Finally, it was decided that the Quanzhe Public Association and the native place associations of the five counties of Putuo, Rushi, Changshu, Haiyan and Qidong would convene another meeting at the same location at 4:00 PM on the 28th of this month, in order to cooperate fully. The Jiangyin Wuxi Joint Shelter has successively repatriated over six thousand refugees. Yesterday (the 25th), the sixth batch of over seven hundred refugees, led by Gao Shifeng, were transported to Wuxi on eight civilian boats.

The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association repatriates refugees to their hometowns every day. It is reported that over thirty-six thousand refugees have already been sent. At 10:00 AM yesterday, another one thousand five hundred refugees were sent off on the Shunfu Wheel, and five hundred were transported on the Longshan Wheel in the evening. It is also learned that there are still over nine thousand refugees in the nine shelters who have not yet been sent away.

Since the Wujiang Shanghai Native Place Association began handling the accommodation and repatriation of refugee fellow villagers, as of yesterday, over five hundred people have been admitted and over two hundred have been repatriated to their hometowns successively. Yesterday afternoon, the third batch of refugees was sent off, with approximately three hundred people. In the future, if there are fellow villagers from the county who need accommodation or repatriation, they can request registration from the association.

Yesterday, the Sichuan Shanghai Native Place Anti-Japanese Support Association completed arrangements with the Railway Bureau for two train carriages. Starting today, registered fellow villagers returning to their hometowns will first be sent to Nanjing, and then the Minsheng Company will be contacted to dispatch ships for transport back to their hometowns. All train fares and boat tickets will be funded by the association. The number of people is estimated to be over one hundred.

Comforting

Yesterday, a German man named Busckist from the Red Cross on Jinghai Ge Road, brought cigarettes and other items to comfort the wounded soldiers in our hospital, and praised the bravery of our army, saying that their spirit was worthy of admiration and that they dealt a blow to the invaders, and wished us victory in the war of resistance. Before leaving, he said that these were just small tokens to express his feelings, showing that foreigners also sympathize with our side.

Yesterday afternoon, members of the Children's National Salvation Association, led by Chen Juanjuan and others, brought flowers to visit Captain Ren Hongpei and crewman Qu Hui of the Air Force wounded in action, and a certain Battalion Commander of the Army at a certain hospital.

In order to facilitate the progress of its work, the Wartime Service Corps of the educational circles of this city has borrowed Yunzhong Girls' Middle School on Avonne Road as its office address. The Corps has been working hard to raise comfort supplies to be remitted to the front lines in the near future.

The Comforting Anti-Japanese Soldiers Fundraising Team organized by the National Jinan University Students Staying Behind Association has already raised donations of one hundred and thirty-eight yuan and two jiao and five fen, as well as other local products. After raising five hundred yuan, comfort items will be purchased separately and sent to the front lines.

Fundraising

The Shanghai International Relief Committee is actively fundraising internationally and in all sectors of the city in order to expand relief efforts for refugees in the war zone and to fund their return to their original homes.

The Shanghai Educational Association's Anti-Japanese Support Association's Steel Collection Office has moved to Jinhua Elementary School, Sanxingfang, Beller Road, French Concession. Currently, the front lines are in greater need of sacks and iron wire. It is hoped that all sectors will send more of these two items. The Association can also send staff to collect and forward them to the front lines. The Joint Charity Relief Committee of this city has specially established a Relief Committee for War Zone Refugees. Now, with the daily increase in refugees, the original shelters are no longer sufficient. The food situation is also extremely dire. In addition to sending letters to all sectors to solicit vacant houses, there is also a great need for food, cash, and transport vehicles. It is deeply hoped that enthusiastic people in society will generously lend or donate, which will benefit the disaster victims immeasurably. The office is located in Renji Hall on Six Ma Road, telephone number 9-960. Also, the Association received donations from all sectors yesterday, including 100 yuan each from Zheng Zhou, Anonymous, Song Ji, and Mr. F.N. Matthews, 150 yuan from Que Zhuren, 100 yuan from the Oriental Hotel fundraiser Chen Songquan, and many others, too numerous to list, totaling over 2,400 yuan.

The Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association, presided over by Madam Tian Shujun, wife of Commander Yang Xiaotian, has been working hard on relief, fundraising, and comfort activities, and the work has been exceptionally active. It is still continuing to raise funds from all parties so that the refugees sheltered by the Association can live safely.
