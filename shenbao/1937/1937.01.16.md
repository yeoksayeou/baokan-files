[Xuzhou] A traveler returning from Xi'an reported that the communist bandit Mao Zedong has dispatched the communist bandit Zhou Enlai to Xi'an to extensively win over the generals of Zhang's and Yang's troops, hoping to communize Xi'an. There are many left-leaning elements within Yang's troops, who are easily swayed. Zhang's troops have complex ideas and are not easily lured. Wang Yizhe, Miao Chengliu, He Zhuguo, Dong Yingbin, and others are currently undecided. Ma Zhanshan was appointed commander-in-chief of the cavalry group army, but seeing the deteriorating situation, he has expressed his resignation. There are many conflicting opinions within Zhang's and Yang's troops, and they have held meetings for days without reaching a clear solution. The communist bandit Mao Zedong has dispatched a large number of political work communist troops to participate in the activities of various units in order to manipulate them. Xi'an merchants and residents are in a state of panic due to the increasing influence of the red bandits, and the order is chaotic. They are fleeing eastward, but transportation is blocked. In the countryside, soldiers and bandits are rampant. Staying in the city is frightening due to the impending war, causing Xi'an to revert to the chaotic state of the incident. There is no clear leader. Although Yang Hucheng has been promoted to commander-in-chief, the Northeast Army has ultimately failed to obey his command. Chishui and Weinan are still heavily fortified.

### Letter of Advice to Northeastern Soldiers from Fellow Northeasterners in Nanjing

Should Take Loving the Country as Their Duty; Do Not Easily Believe Others' Instigation

[Nanjing] Fellow Northeasterners in Nanjing issued the following letter of advice to Northeastern armed soldiers on the 15th: Dear Northeastern armed soldiers, since the September 18th Incident, our elders and brothers have been slaughtered, our ancestral graves have been trampled by the enemy, and even the tragic events of being buried alive and the cruel torture of being sliced to death have been experienced by our Northeastern compatriots one by one. How tragic is this! In order to avenge this great humiliation and to retaliate for the national and family hatred, we can only follow the central government's intentions, obey the central government's orders, and in the unified national salvation steps, obey the leadership of our sole leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, invigorate our spirit, bury ourselves in hard work, strive to suppress bandits and eliminate traitors, and prepare to resist foreign aggression and save the country. Only in this way can we have a day to return to our hometown and a day to avenge ourselves. The central government's post-incident measures for the Xi'an Incident are very lenient, not only in accordance with legal principles but also in accordance with human sentiment. It still trusts the Northeastern soldiers sincerely and relies on them as before. Not only do the people of the whole country support and uphold them, but even Deputy Commander Zhang sincerely admires them, admiring the central government's care for the Northeastern soldiers, showing both kindness and righteousness, without being meticulous. Dear Northeastern soldiers, under such great tolerance and inclusiveness, how should you appreciate the central government's painstaking efforts to preserve the country's strength and cherish the lives of the soldiers? Atone for your sins and make amends for your past transgressions and restore your inherent glory! Unexpectedly, in the past two weeks, you have not only shown no sign of obeying orders, but also reportedly are attempting to cooperate with the red bandits, deploy troops, and build fortifications to prepare to defy orders. We firmly believe that this is only the absurd proposition of one or two people and is by no means the original intention of all our dear Northeastern soldiers. However, if you blindly follow and do not think of extricating yourselves, and are always used by others, then you will forever bear the name of traitors and will never have a day to return home. The army that resists Japan becomes a traitor that destroys the country, and the soldiers who suppress bandits become slaves driven by bandits. How shameful is this! Not only will the people of the country condemn you, but even Deputy Commander Zhang will deeply hate you. Moreover, Deputy Commander Zhang is awaiting punishment in the capital, and the central government treats him generously. Even if our Northeastern soldiers do not consider the country, do you not consider the reputation and future of the deputy commander and yourselves? Turning misfortune into blessing and turning danger into safety lies in your recognizing the great righteousness, resolutely repenting, breaking away from the encirclement of reactionary forces, and showing your position of loyalty to the government. The Northeast has been lost for five years. The elders in our hometown are leading their children, looking westward, praying that the Northeastern soldiers can return home soon and reunite. Therefore, when we hear of the Northeastern soldiers winning in bandit suppression, we are overjoyed. When we hear of the Northeastern soldiers being injured in bandit suppression, we are deeply saddened. It can be seen that your every move is related to the honor and disgrace of the Northeastern elders. Therefore, the elders in the Northeast all hope that you will become a strong force for bandit suppression and a brave soldier against the enemy, and even more hope that under the unified command of the government, you will align your steps, obey orders, and complete the great task of pacifying the interior and resisting foreign aggression, and restoring the inherent mountains and rivers. Dear Northeastern soldiers, you should think deeply, rather than being sinners for all time, why not preserve your limited strength and reserve it as a vanguard against the enemy? Rather than being traitors to the nation, why not cherish the hopes of the elders, reject the rebel orders of the reactionaries, and not make unnecessary sacrifices? In this way, after the recovery of our homeland in the future, you can still obtain the understanding and admiration of the Northeastern compatriots. If you are still stubborn and willing to betray the country, then it will be easy for the central government to eliminate the rebels. You have fought for thousands of miles, and your military life has been full of hardship, all for the sake of loyalty to the country, restoring the homeland, and continuing the lives of the nation and individuals. If you disobey orders and perish together, it is not worth regretting, but your family, old and young, relatives, and friends will all be implicated and will never have the face to meet the compatriots of the whole country. How tragic is that! Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel horrified and burst into tears. Dear soldiers, you should take obeying the leader as your sacred duty and love the country as your goal. Do not easily believe the instigation of one or two people, or listen to the deception of a few traitors. They do not love the country, nor do they save the hometown. They simply want to sacrifice you more than 100,000 strong soldiers to achieve their ambitions. I hope you will be aware of this and hope you will accept the government's post-incident measures. Especially, I hope you will put the country and nation first, and return to your original defense posts as soon as possible. The central government has always been tolerant and will never hold you accountable for your past mistakes. At the same time, we also hope that Yang Hucheng, Sun Weiru, and other military and political authorities in Shaanxi Province will obey the central government's orders, accept the post-incident measures for the Shaanxi Incident, maintain local order, and prevent the spread of red bandits. At this time when foreign aggression is imminent and the national crisis is pressing, we must not further promote the division of the country and give the enemy opportunities for aggression. If you still do not repent and make amends, and if you waste the country's strength and lose the opportunity to recover lost territory, then not only will the government and the people condemn you, but even we Northeastern people who have fled to the interior cannot forgive your reactionary behavior. In short, soldiers take obedience as their sacred duty, and the people take patriotism as the prerequisite. I think our Northeastern soldiers in Shaanxi have always been at the forefront of loving the country and hometown. From now on, do not hesitate on the wrong path any longer, quickly show your attitude, accept the central government's orders, obey the government's guidance, and maintain your military reputation. The opportunity for success or failure is in this moment. We sincerely look forward to your expression of upholding justice. Jointly initiated by 3,549 fellow Northeasterners in Nanjing.

### Draft Regulations of the National Products United Company Finalized

[Nanjing] The draft prospectus for the National Products United Company's stock offering has been prepared, totaling twenty items. The company's capital is tentatively set at 2 million legal tender, to be raised in two phases. The first phase is 1 million, divided into two thousand shares, each share priced at 500 legal tender.

However, to ensure widespread subscription, the maximum number of shares each national product company or factory may subscribe is tentatively set at forty. Shareholders who subscribe in the first phase will also enjoy the following: ㊀ preferential rights to subscribe in the second phase and subsequent share increases; ㊁ after dividends are distributed, if there are profits, 5% will be set aside as a special dividend for the first-phase shareholders. The subscription period is set from February 10th to February 28th, and the collection period is set from March 10th to March 25th. After the subscription period expires, if there are any remaining shares, they may be freely subscribed by various national product companies and factories. The funds for these shares must be paid in full before April 30th. The shares are registered and come in three types: one share, five shares, and ten shares. The company's shareholders and their representatives must be of Chinese nationality. The dividend is set at 8% per annum, and commercial shares will be paid first.

Current Commentary

### Goering's Visit to Rome

— Hua

General Goering of Germany arrived in Rome the day before yesterday and is currently meeting with Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano in the Villa Medici to discuss various issues between Germany and Italy. We remember that a few months ago, Ciano visited Berlin, which led to the signing of the German-Italian agreement. Therefore, Goering's visit to Rome is likely to produce equally important results. We cannot help but pay close attention to this meeting, which has significant international implications.

Goering, the main figure in this meeting, is the first thing worth noting. He is the Premier of Prussia, the head of the German secret police, the Speaker of the Reichstag, the Air Force Minister, and the Director-General of the newly established "Four-Year Plan." In addition to these many prestigious titles, General Goering recently attracted worldwide attention with his famous saying "Guns instead of butter." In fact, this figure who holds five important positions is no less powerful than Chancellor Hitler in Germany's domestic and foreign affairs. His personal visit to Rome after Ciano's visit to Berlin a few months ago should have even greater implications.

The importance of this Rome meeting can also be reflected in the recent developments in the European situation. The most prominent trend in recent European developments is the increasing severity of internal panic in Germany and its increasingly isolated diplomatic position. A few months ago, Germany experienced a butter panic, which has now developed into a wheat panic. If this deepening panic is not remedied politically and diplomatically, the future crisis will be unthinkable. However, in diplomacy, since the establishment of the German-Japanese alliance and the German-Italian agreement, Germany's position has not only not been strengthened, but has become even more unfavorable. The most obvious point is that the United Kingdom, which has always implicitly supported Germany, has felt threatened by the German-Japanese alliance to British interests in the Far East and by the German-Italian agreement to the British position in Europe. It has changed its attitude and is improving its relations with the Soviet Union while also working closely with France. The signing of the British-Italian Mediterranean Agreement at the end of last month was largely due to France's behind-the-scenes efforts. Due to the signing of the British-Italian agreement, the joint German-Italian intervention in Spain suddenly became a solo act by Germany due to Italy's increasingly lukewarm attitude. As a result, the German military's ambitions in Morocco were immediately met with strong opposition from the United Kingdom, and Foreign Secretary Eden even adopted a more acerbic attitude, criticizing General Goering's "guns instead of butter" policy as inappropriate.

Under these circumstances, General Goering's visit to Rome is no small task. His first step should be to further promote closer collusion between the two countries based on the existing German-Italian agreement. His second step is to use Italy's relations to get the United Kingdom to rekindle old ties with Germany. From there, he can further isolate the current close cooperation between the United Kingdom and France. If this mission can be fully achieved, the temporary calm created by the joint efforts of the United Kingdom and France in the past month or two will undergo dramatic changes and become a resurgence of the aggression front.

From Goering's decisive move to go to Rome in person, we feel that he will not return empty-handed. However, we can also see the obstacles he will inevitably encounter in other areas. First, Italy's compromise with the United Kingdom was achieved through France. Italy has maintained relatively good relations with France for a year. It will not be easy for Germany to isolate France now. Second, it is said that the German-Italian talks will include the issue of Germany establishing an airbase on the Italian-held island of Dodecanese. This may not have much to do with Italy, but from the perspective of the United Kingdom's position in the Mediterranean, it can never allow the intrusion of German power. These are the two main points. Of course, Germany's ambitions for Southern Europe and even Spain and Morocco cannot be ignored. What exactly this Nazi leader will bring back from the fascist homeland remains to be seen in the outcome of the negotiations in the next few days.

### Aiming at Transoceanic Offense, America Implements Giant Battleship Policy

To Start Building Two Dreadnoughts This Summer; Requests Increased Funding for Pearl Harbor Port Construction

[Washington] Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that the United States will begin construction of two 35,000-ton battleships on June 1st. Their speed will be three to four knots lower than that of other countries' battleships, but their armament and gun caliber will be superior. The new ships of the four countries, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, all have a speed of 30 knots, while the American ships will only have 27 knots. The Secretary of the Navy and senior officials believe that battleships should have superior offensive power. Therefore, the new ships will be equipped with nine 16-inch guns or twelve 14-inch guns. The final decision on which caliber to use will probably be made after the London Treaty officially expires on April 1st. The Secretary of the Navy also stated that the United States will build twelve new warships this year, including the two aforementioned super-dreadnoughts, five destroyers, three light cruisers, and two submarines. The Navy still opposes building large airships and advocates building more warships. (National Telegraph, 14th)

[Washington] Secretary of the Navy Swanson stated today that the Navy is requesting an additional $2 million for the construction of Pearl Harbor Naval Base, as the $10 million allocated in the budget is insufficient. (National Telegraph, 14th)

[Tokyo] The U.S. government aims to build the world's number one navy, and is working hard to complete its existing and new plans. President Roosevelt has issued an order to build battleships, and will begin construction of two new battleships with amazing performance on June 1st. The U.S. intends to pursue its transoceanic offensive strategy by using the principles of large ships and giant guns. The U.S. will ensure the new battleships will have a displacement of 35,000 tons, a speed of 26 to 27 knots, and three gun turrets. The U.S. Navy, which adheres to the principles of large ships and giant guns, is certainly preparing for nine 16-inch, three-gun turrets. Currently, only Britain has two battleships with nine 16-inch guns. As soon as the U.S. Navy enters a treaty-free era, it will begin construction of the world's largest super-dreadnoughts, which is very noteworthy. Therefore, the Japanese Navy is very concerned about the U.S. Navy's active expansion of its naval forces using the principles of large ships and giant guns. Japan can only move towards establishing an independent economic and military structure in order to ensure control of the Western Pacific. (Domei News Agency, 15th)

### Italy Sends Note to Britain Accepting Naval Restrictions

Battleship Gun Caliber Not to Exceed Fourteen Inches; On Condition That All Other Countries Accept

[London] The Italian government recently sent a note to Britain stating that the caliber of the guns on its battleships will not exceed fourteen inches, but only on the condition that all major naval powers accept this restriction. Official sources are very pleased that major naval powers, except Japan and some second-tier naval powers, have accepted this restriction, thus reducing the naval arms race. (Havas News Agency, 15th)

### Soviet Union Adds New Ships

Le Havre. The keel of a 3,000-ton reconnaissance ship ordered by Soviet Russia was laid at the Ottelo Shipyard here today. The average speed of the ship is 42.5 knots. A 5,000-ton cruiser is also under construction at the shipyard. (National Telegram, 14th)

### Spanish Rebel Forces Launch Fierce Air, Land, and Sea Attack on Malaga

10,000 Moorish Troops and 5,000 Italian Soldiers Assist; Important Town of Estepona Occupied

Gibraltar The authorities in Algeciras announced today that the Nationalist forces had occupied the town of Estepona, a strong point on the road to Malaga, after a day of heavy fighting. The town has an important iron ore mine and a population of about 100,000. A Nationalist force of 20,000 men, composed of 10,000 Moorish troops and 5,000 Italian soldiers, launched the attack. Two aircraft dropped several bombs from the sky, and dozens of fishing boats assisted from the sea. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. (Reuters, 14th)

Barcelona According to news from the besieged port of Malaga, 65 miles northeast of Gibraltar, the Nationalist forces launched their second fierce attack on the port this week from the air, land, and sea, causing many deaths and injuries and much damage. According to a communiqué from the Spanish government's air and naval ministries in Valencia, two rebel cruisers, one gunboat, and several small boats participated in the attack, and a squadron of twin-engine aircraft assisted from the sky. Government aircraft dropped two 200-pound bombs on the rebel cruiser "Admiral Cervera," which quickly sailed towards Ceuta. The other enemy ships also dispersed quickly. (Reuters, 15th)

Gibraltar According to news from Avila, a plot by government troops to bomb and attack the Nationalist forces in the villages of Bobadilla and Arrebatacapas was recently discovered. Nationalist engineers found eighty large landmines buried underground in the two villages, all equipped with electrical devices connected to the headquarters of the government engineers. All that was needed was to flip a switch to detonate them simultaneously. When the Moorish troops and other soldiers began to advance, one of the shells stored in the house suddenly exploded, destroying the entire house. The Nationalist forces were fortunate to escape unharmed. (Reuters, 14th)

Four hundred and ten residents left the capital on a train today, but the train derailed in Ocana, Toledo province, injuring thirty-six people. (Havas News Agency, 14th)

### Göring's Continued Talks with Italian Prime Minister in Rome

Spanish Situation as Main Topic, Consensus on Joint Defense Against Russia

[Rome] German Aviation Minister Göring continued his talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia this afternoon for over two hours. Afterward, the Prime Minister hosted a banquet at the palace to welcome Göring. Responsible sources confirmed that the discussions between Mussolini and Göring focused solely on the Spanish issue and did not touch upon commercial matters. As for rumors that Italy would act as an intermediary between Germany and Britain to bring them closer, similar to the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement, political figures have neither denied nor confirmed them. (Havas, 14th)

[Paris] Le Matin recently published news from Rome stating that Mussolini and Göring have agreed to exert their best efforts in diplomatic channels to prevent the establishment of a Soviet republic in Spain. They will also bring to the attention of other countries the Soviet Union's propaganda activities within Spain. (Havas, 14th)

[Rome] Regarding the details of the talks between the Italian Prime Minister and General Göring today, various newspapers believe that the main topic of discussion was the attitude that Germany and Italy will adopt towards the Spanish issue in the future. Giornale d'Italia reported, "Regarding the issue of prohibiting volunteers from enlisting in Spain, in short, negotiations on the entire issue of non-interference in the Spanish civil war are nearing their final stages. General Göring's visit at this juncture is naturally of utmost importance." Giornale d'Italia further explained that if a government controlled by the Soviet Union were to be established in Spain, it would pose various dangers. "This is a matter of concern for both Germany and Italy, and they should take steps to prevent it. However, this shared stance of the two countries is purely defensive. This is true not only for the Spanish situation but also for the situation in Europe and the Mediterranean. Furthermore, Germany and Italy hold completely consistent views on the Spanish issue. This is not due to the ideological connection between Germany and Italy, but because Spain is also a European country and has inherent ties with Germany and Italy in terms of politics and culture. However, it is strange that other countries, especially those that are satisfied with the current state of Europe, do not share this feeling." (Havas, 14th)

[Paris] Various newspapers here have commented on German Aviation Minister General Göring's visit to Italy, with some saying, "Göring's trip is intended to draw Italy into the vortex of the Spanish civil war," or "While Göring was holding talks with Mussolini, the anti-French movement in German newspapers resurfaced," or "The news carried by German newspapers about the establishment of a Soviet republic in southern France is mere rumor and slander, intended to allow Germany and Italy to freely reject Britain's proposal to prohibit volunteers from enlisting in Spain." L'Ère Nouvelle, the newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party, reported that German newspapers are now heavily publicizing the following issues: "A Soviet republic has now been established in Perpignan, southern France," or "The French government will be overthrown," and "France has no control over the areas bordering France and Spain, making it impossible to control the situation. Therefore, Germany should refuse to accept Britain's proposal to prohibit volunteers from enlisting in Spain." L'Humanité, the Communist newspaper, reported, "Germany and Italy are currently employing tactics to relentlessly attack France. Their intention is to incite distrust among the British public towards the policies adopted by the French government, especially regarding the Spanish civil war. At the same time, Germany and Italy will accuse France of being an ally of communism and violating the non-interference policy, thereby continuously interfering in the Spanish civil war." Le Peuple, the organ of the General Confederation of Labor, reported, "It would be foolish to dream that the German and Italian fascist countries will abandon their adventurous actions in Spain." (Havas, 15th)

### France Forbids Volunteers from Going to Spain

Government Asks Parliament for Authorization to Issue Substitute Ordinances at Any Time

[Paris] The government has submitted a bill to the Chamber of Deputies to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain. The bill proposes granting the government full powers for a period of six months, during which the government may issue substitute ordinances at any time to prohibit the recruitment of volunteers in France to enlist in Spain. Violators will be subject to imprisonment for up to one year or a fine of 100 to 10,000 francs. Prime Minister Blum personally attended to explain that the government will issue an order prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain as soon as other related countries implement the same ban. He insisted that the Chamber of Deputies should begin discussing the bill tomorrow to demonstrate the French Parliament's determination. Once an international agreement is implemented, France will take the same measures as other countries regarding the prohibition of volunteers. (Havas, 14th)

[Paris] The Legislative Committee of the Chamber of Deputies has unanimously passed the government's bill prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain. (Havas, 14th)

### Anti-French and Anti-Czech Propaganda in German Newspapers Intensifies

Deliberately Creating an Atmosphere of Soviet Activity; France and Czechoslovakia Deny and Refute as Groundless

[London] After the situation between France and Germany regarding the Moroccan issue eased slightly, the actions of German newspapers have recently caused renewed unrest in Europe. The news of communist activities in southern France carried by right-wing French newspapers has become excellent material for German newspapers, as they are reprinted with the title "Soviet Rule in Southern France." In addition, European capitals are quite disturbed by German newspapers' propaganda that there is also Soviet activity in Czechoslovakia. According to German newspapers, several groups of people wearing Soviet uniforms have been seen participating in military exercises near the border. However, impartial observers say that the reports in German newspapers are completely unfounded, and there is little sign of Soviet activity in Czechoslovakia. (Reuters, 14th)

[Berlin] The anti-French movement in German newspapers has recently intensified, causing concern among diplomatic circles. The French Embassy has held talks with German authorities, informing them that this attitude of German newspapers is causing many inconveniences and should be addressed. (Havas, 15th)

Perpignan, Southern France: German newspapers have repeatedly reported in recent days that a Soviet regime has been established in southern France, with Perpignan as its center. The mayor of the city, Senator Béra, has stated that this news from the German side is completely fabricated and not worth laughing at. At the same time, the City Council unanimously passed a motion protesting the rumor that the city has become a center of unrest, stating that the residents of the city and the residents of the Pyrénées-Orientales department to which the city belongs are living in peace and tranquility, and no incidents have occurred. The City Council also decided to forward this protest to several ministers in Paris for their review. (Havas, 14th)

[London] German newspapers have recently repeatedly engaged in anti-Czech propaganda, claiming that the Czech army and administrative organs have been dominated by Soviet forces. The Czech side has responded by stating that there is absolutely no Soviet influence in the Czech army and administrative organs, and the claim that there are many Russian officers in the Czech army is untrue. As for the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia, it is the same as the Communist Parties in other democratic countries and only expresses its political views in parliament. British diplomatic circles are paying close attention to this statement from the Czech side. In addition, Germany has also claimed that the Soviet Union has built an airfield in Czechoslovakia to serve as a base for the Soviet air force. Regarding this matter, the Czech government suggested to Germany that the German air attaché stationed in Czechoslovakia should conduct an on-site investigation to determine whether this is the case, but the German government did not respond. The Czech government has now decided to make the same suggestion to other countries, including Britain. It is reported that Britain has dispatched its air attaché to conduct an on-site investigation. (Havas, 14th)

### Roosevelt Does Not Intend to Interfere in European Affairs

US Democratic Party Congressmen Advocate Amending Neutrality Act

[Washington] There are widespread rumors abroad that President Roosevelt intends to convene an international conference to discuss the issue of maintaining peace. Official sources have not confirmed this, and political figures also say that the President is unlikely to take this step. Moreover, if France and Germany can find a way to resolve their economic disputes, their relations may improve. Therefore, President Roosevelt is even less likely to initiate this international conference. In addition, the President is very busy dealing with domestic issues and has little time to deal with foreign affairs. For example, several laws are about to expire and need to be extended by Congress, especially the Neutrality Act, which will expire at the end of February. The new bill will be submitted to Congress for discussion and is expected to be voted on in May. According to some powerful figures in the United States, they have long wanted to urge President Roosevelt to interfere in various international issues, especially European issues, but so far, these attempts have not been successful. (Havas, 14th)

[Washington] Twenty-five Democratic Congressmen held a secret meeting today to amend the Neutrality Act. The current Neutrality Act stipulates that the President has full power to decide whether to embargo arms, but they advocate that it should be stipulated in a mandatory manner that arms should be embargoed to all belligerent countries. Progressive Democratic Congressman Maverick, who is most strongly in favor of a strong neutrality policy in Congress, said that he fears that recent US arms shipments to Europe have been transferred to Spain. He supports Congress stipulating that arms should be embargoed to any area in a state of war. It is reported that the faction in the House of Representatives that advocates a mandatory embargo will cooperate with some senators, such as Nye, to find a way to bring the Neutrality Act up for debate in Congress again. At the same time, Senator Lundeen of the Farmer-Labor Party and Congressman Johnson have simultaneously proposed in both houses that the government take over the arms industry and prohibit private individuals from engaging in the import and export of arms.

### Adjustment of Relations between Britain and Southern Ireland

De Valera in London, Talks with MacDonald

[London] Irish Free State Executive Chairman de Valera and Dominion Affairs Minister Malcolm MacDonald met twice in London yesterday, much to the surprise of the general public. It is reported that de Valera was returning to Dublin from Switzerland and took the opportunity to visit MacDonald. It is said that the focus of the talks was mainly on the outstanding political and economic issues between Britain and Ireland. Although the meeting lasted for five hours, it cannot be formally considered helpful, and there were no formal decisions. It is reported that the attitude of both parties during the talks was extremely sincere, so the general public hopes that this meeting may be the beginning of resuming negotiations, which may produce more concrete results. It is also reported that the two parties also discussed the issues of the Free State's participation in the coronation of the British monarch and the Imperial Conference, as well as the constitutional status under the recent legislation of the Free State. There are also claims that the financial opinions between Britain and Ireland must have been mentioned in this meeting for fair adjustment. Some people also believe that de Valera is quite concerned about the recent activities of some Irish people participating in the Spanish civil war, so the issue of non-interference in the Spanish civil war must have been discussed in this meeting. It is reported that de Valera quite agrees with Britain's non-interference policy and the general direction of British foreign affairs, and also expressed his support for the national defense plan. The meeting between de Valera and MacDonald has caused surprise and satisfaction among people everywhere, especially in Dublin. Today, The Irish Times reported that the people of both countries are eager for the past misunderstandings between Britain and Ireland to be eliminated as soon as possible. From a political point of view, the current situation is indeed much better than before. What the Irish people are asking for is nothing more than: ㊀ a resolution to the economic war, ㊁ a more permanent agreement with Britain to protect the status of citizens of the Irish Free State.

### President of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce Addresses the China Issue

Regrets Attitude of Japanese Government and Public, Each Party Discusses Foreign Affairs Questions, Seiyūkai and House of Peers Advocate Caution

[Tokyo] The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry held a New Year's banquet at the Tokyo Kaikan on the evening of the 14th, inviting four cabinet members, including Baba, Ogawa, Hayashi, and Nagata, to attend. President Yūki Toyotarō spoke on the China issue, stating that the chamber earnestly hopes for the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations and the cooperation between China and Japan, to become a stabilizing force in East Asia, establish peace in the Far East, and bring prosperity and welfare to the people of both countries. There is no room for debate that with Japanese capital and technology, combined with China's labor force and resources, the boundless wealth of cotton, coal, and iron mines can be developed. If the state of trade is adjusted, Japan will gain a huge market, and China's 400 million people will also get cheap and good goods, which is obviously beneficial to each other and brings mutual prosperity. If both China and Japan cling to the various past events, there will be various arguments. However, at this time, it is necessary to sweep away the old viewpoints, return to the original good neighborly relationship, and gradually remove the causes of confrontation to carry out adjustment work. According to my observation, there are regrettable aspects to the attitude that Japan and the Japanese people have taken towards China in the past. We firmly believe that the Japanese people have a great need for self-restraint, and that Chinese intellectuals and the public should also abandon their past prejudices and advocate cooperation from a general perspective to achieve Sino-Japanese friendship. On this occasion, I solemnly declare that this chamber is ready for concrete issues concerning economy and trade to carry out adjustment work with China. (Domei, 15th)

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives' negotiation committee on handling foreign affairs held a meeting at the new Diet building from 1:00 PM on the 15th to discuss questioning on foreign affairs issues. The Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties, as well as other factions, expressed their opinions, but the Minseitō party maintained a cautious attitude and was unmoved. In the end, the small committee advocated retaining the disposition of the old urgent resolution, and no conclusion was reached on that day. Therefore, the handling method for foreign affairs issues after the resumption of the Diet will be discussed again to deploy the questioning array. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM. (Domei, 15th)

[Tokyo] The various factions in the House of Peers are deliberating on countermeasures for various important issues due to the impending resumption of the Diet, and each faction is taking a particularly cautious attitude towards foreign affairs issues. The Kenkyūkai held its first regular meeting of the tenth year on the 14th to exchange opinions on foreign and domestic affairs. The Kōseikai also, in view of the importance of foreign affairs issues, studied countermeasures by a special committee and decided that the national policy on foreign affairs should not be used as a tool for political strife. Merely observing the surface of the Arita diplomacy and opposing it would be too hasty. If one is not familiar with the real situation of foreign affairs and criticizes the authorities, there is a risk of inducing domestic turmoil. Therefore, it is not advisable to submit proposals on foreign affairs issues. Although political parties may take this action, the House of Peers should adopt a cautious attitude from its own independent standpoint. (Domei, 15th)

[New York] Two Chinese sailors on the Blue Funnel Line mail ship Melampus were arrested by customs officials today on suspicion of smuggling opium into the United States. (National Telegraph, 14th)

[Washington] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau met with reporters today and commented on the interception of opium worth US$76,250 on the British ship Melampus, saying that the cooperation between the British crew and US customs officers has made it necessary for the Treasury Department to waive or greatly reduce the fine that should be imposed on the ship. According to the law, the ship carried more than 4,000 ounces of opium and should be fined up to $100,000. According to a statement from the US Treasury Department, the opium seized was mixed with other goods, and the amount was the largest of any case broken in New York. (Reuters, 14th)

㊀ Of the 69 General Motors factories nationwide, 34 have been shut down, with 115,000 workers on strike out of a total of 135,000 workers.

㊁ If the labor unrest is not resolved, all of the company's factories will probably be completely shut down by the 23rd of this month.

㊂ The company's production volume for January will only be one-third of the original estimate of 224,000 units.

㊃ The Michigan relief director said that few workers have requested relief.

A Congressman Has No Preconceived Notions About Amendment

### Continued Exposure of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Zhengzhou Plotting to Harm Our Country

Commissioner's Office Releases Some Documents Utilizing Bandit Riots and Han Traitor Investigations

(D) Relations between China and Japan are extremely dangerous. From Chiang Kai-shek downward, all call Japan an "enemy," and the anti-Japanese sentiment is increasingly fierce. In Central China, in order to prevent the infiltration of northern Japanese forces, the Yellow River is used as a barrier against Japan. Military affairs, politics, trade, and commerce are all arranged in defensive positions, determined not to let the Japanese cross the Lei Chi River one step. Henan is the front line, the Yellow River is the front, and the Longhai Railway is used to cover it. There are also the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways, and a number of highways and air routes, to connect with the rear. Zhengzhou is the intersection of the Pinghan and Longhai lines, and can be called an important place. Because it is a commercial port, there is superficially no reason to refuse Japanese residence, but the Chinese side often says, "Although commercial ports allow merchants to reside, military and political figures are not allowed to reside and operate." In the name of protection, secret agents follow to investigate their actions, never leaving for a moment. The consul holds a "hands-off" policy on all Chinese actions, only lamenting that "diplomacy without real strength behind it is equal to zero." The Longhai Railway Bureau does not purchase cheap Japanese goods, and the Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce promotes that Japanese sugar contains toxins, arresting and threatening Chinese who purchase it, using every means possible. Is this what you call neighborly harmony? In reality, they are just trying every possible way to drive out the Japanese. The adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is hopeless, and the future is bleak. Even if there are any results in the future, it will only be a temporary expedient to avoid war. If there is no particularly major change, shaking hands between the two countries is fundamentally unthinkable. If this stalemate continues for several years, there will eventually be a break. The purpose of establishing the Zhengzhou agency is really here. Sun Tzu's "Use of Spies" chapter says, "Loving money of a hundred gold coins, not knowing the enemy's situation, is the height of inhumanity. Such a person is not a general, not an assistant to the ruler, not a master of victory." The Zhengzhou agency is really set up in this important place to investigate the enemy's situation and overcome all difficulties. Personal hardship and persecution are accepted with joy. It would be a great loss to the purpose of establishing the agency and would violate the determination to sacrifice if we bear the heavy responsibility of not being able to find out the enemy's situation. However, what is the real situation of the Zhengzhou agency?

### Japanese Merchants in Tianjin Establish North China and Manchuria Transportation Company

Capital of 500,000 Yuan and 80 Automobiles, Expanded Sales Scope of Private Goods in the Future

Tianjin Correspondence, the trend of smuggling in North China has revived recently. A certain party's efforts to smuggle goods have more concrete plans, so the smuggled goods in Tianjin have recently filled warehouses again. Automobiles carrying smuggled goods, guarded by ronin, drive on various roads, unscrupulous. The following is a record of the latest developments.

Manchuria Company

Recently, a certain country's merchants such as Shimomoto Seiichi, supported by the authorities of that country, have established a long-distance automobile company in Tianjin that runs from Tianjin to Rehe Chengde, Chaoyang, Outer Mongolia Kulun, Pingdiquan, and other places. It is named "North China Manchuria Liaison Transportation Company." The address has been found on Fushimi Street in the Japanese Concession. The capital is set at 500,000 yuan, and it is planned to purchase 80 large long-distance heavy-duty automobiles. 40 vehicles have already arrived, and it is scheduled to open temporarily on the 15th. The internal divisions of the company include transportation, sales, liaison, and public relations. It has already started operations. Its business scope is purely to be responsible for freight transportation, with dedicated bodyguards escorting smuggled goods, such as hemp, sugar, textiles, medicines, and all foreign goods, and can be responsible for transporting them to destinations. Branch offices have been set up in Duolun, Kulun, Chaoyang, Chengde, and other places. After the company opens, the sales channels for smuggled goods can invade the hinterland of Mongolia and Rehe.

King of Smuggling

Tianjin's only smuggler is Xie, the younger brother of Xie Jieshi, the treacherous "Manchurian" Foreign Minister, nicknamed the "King of Smuggling." He established the "International Trading Company" in a certain neighborhood of the Japanese Concession, dealing in smuggled goods such as rayon, white sugar, and foreign cloth. It is reported that the "King of Smuggling" has a total of more than 300 followers, one-third of whom are ronin from a certain country, with dedicated responsibilities for bodyguarding, escorting goods, and collecting payments. He is the largest smuggler in Tianjin. In the past two years, he has earned millions of yuan. The "King of Smuggling" has connections with the military, police, and consulates of a certain party. He is able to command great respect within a certain concession. His subordinates also employ several people from a certain country to serve as bodyguards. His arrogance can be seen from this. Recently, in order to facilitate control and protection, a certain party has restricted the emergence of small smugglers and is actively suppressing the existing "special trade merchants" in order to increase the power of the "King of Smuggling" and make the smuggling organization unified.

Ronin Bodyguards

When the Prevention of Road Transportation Smuggling Inspection Office first moved to Tianjin, smugglers were slightly cautious because they feared that smuggled goods would be confiscated and confiscated. The automobiles transporting smuggled goods to Gaoyang and various counties in southern Hebei mostly changed to driving at night. However, the security of the anti-smuggling personnel of the Prevention of Road Transportation Smuggling Inspection Office has not yet been agreed upon, so the days have been spent busy with investigation work. Li Tonghua, the deputy director of the office, is currently negotiating in Jinan on the issue of intercepting smuggled goods. It is expected that anti-smuggling work will begin after Deputy Director Li returns to Tianjin. Tianjin smugglers, having learned of the above situation, have recently become even more unscrupulous. Automobiles transporting smuggled goods travel back and forth day and night, but the cars are all flying the flag of a certain country, guarded by ronin, one to three people per car, depending on the value of the goods. Outside Tianjin Customs, patrol officers have cracked several cases. The customs authorities have recently established strict anti-smuggling measures, but the profits from smuggling are very high, and smugglers are not afraid of this minor loss, even if they are occasionally confiscated and confiscated.

Beining Railway

The Beining Railway had very prosperous freight transportation in the twenty-fifth year. The main income was the transportation of smuggled goods from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin. Merchants from a certain country shipped smuggled goods by sea, landed in Qinhuangdao, paid a quarter of the customs duties to the "Jidong" puppet organization, and forced them to transport to Tianjin on the Beining Railway. These smuggled goods flowed in like a tide every day. Last year, the Tianjin General Station had the strange incident of the Beining passenger car bow being crushed and damaged due to overloading of smuggled goods. Incidents such as axle burning delays and ronin escorting and forcibly boarding passenger cars became commonplace. According to the announcement of the Beining Railway Bureau, the total operating income in the twenty-fifth year was more than 29 million yuan due to prosperous freight transportation, an increase of more than 4 million yuan compared with the twenty-fourth year. This was thanks to smuggling. However, since this year, smugglers have mostly used automobiles to transport smuggled goods, via Tanggu, along the Tianjin-Tanggu Road to Tianjin, or via the Luan Tong Road to Tongzhou and then to Beijing, so it is unknown when this unprecedented ugly international trade drama will end.

### Guangdong Merchants and People Firmly Request Changes to New Business Tax Standards

If Requests Are Not Granted, They Will Suspend Business Pending a Decision. Merchants from All Industries Claim the New Tax Makes It Difficult to Operate.

The Guangdong Finance Department's changes to the business tax assessment standards have caused panic among all merchants and people. Representatives from various business firms believe that at a time when commerce is declining, only one in a hundred can maintain the status quo, let alone make a profit. They once gathered at the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request that the government be called upon through the Chamber of Commerce, but according to official sources, the authorities will promote the business tax throughout the province this time, and the newly revised assessment standards are considered appropriate and will be implemented. On the business side, they are still in a wait-and-see position. Originally, starting in January, they would have to handle matters according to the new tax standards, but recently very few merchants and people have reported according to the regulations. Furthermore, it is heard that the opinions of all merchants and people are that if the government forces the implementation, they will have no choice but to suspend business pending a resolution. From this, one can see a glimpse of the merchants' and people's hardships.

On the 8th of this month, merchants from all industries once again convened a meeting of representatives from all industries and decided on the following three methods: ㊀ Support the resolutions of the two meetings of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 5th and 7th. ㊁ Each should carefully examine the relationship between the new business tax and the interests of their respective industries, formulate detailed opinions, and send them to the Chamber of Commerce immediately for vigorous advocacy. ㊂ If the government cannot withdraw its order to continue to use the 25th year's tax assessment standards, they will have no choice but to implement a uniform suspension of business and wait for a complete solution to show their determination. After learning about the situation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce decided to collect the submissions from various merchants and submit them to the authorities for processing during the day. It is found that merchants from all industries have already sent submissions to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in recent days. Here are a few excerpts to clarify the inside story. The submission from the sugar and noodle industry reads: "We believe that Guangdong has the most miscellaneous taxes in the country. If merchants and people can barely afford it, they will pay according to the regulations, but today's change in the business tax rate is not only difficult to implement, but it also leaves most shops with no business to operate, let alone pay taxes. Because the current tax rate cannot tax goods, it conflicts with the central government's original tax rules. It is simply a transfer price tax law. Since the beginning of taxation, there has never been a tax name that collects unlimited times. Moreover, Guangdong has the fewest products, and most products rely on foreign imports. Shops that directly import goods from outside have larger capital and fewer numbers. Among the shops that resell in the city, the middle and lower-level shops account for 80% to 90%. If taxes are levied on business income, each resale will be taxed once. If the resale is unlimited, the tax will be levied an unlimited number of times. In this autumn of commercial decline, business is thin, and encountering multiple levies will definitely increase costs. Then, except for a few shops that directly transport and sell, most of the middle and lower-level shops will inevitably have no business to operate. Therefore, our industry, etc., believes that this type of tax rule is completely unworkable. As for the claim that the business tax revenue itself is less than others, it should be known that Guangdong's unique miscellaneous taxes are ten times the burden of Guangdong people compared to other provinces. Guangdong is the source of the revolution and has been ravaged by warlords many times, with everything plundered. Now that political power is unified, we still beg for the realization of relieving the people of pain. Therefore, we have slightly practiced one or two, hoping that you will adopt them and convey them to the government, and quickly withdraw the new chapter on business tax to ensure commercial stability. Not only will the business firms be fortunate, but also the people in the city will be very fortunate." Another submission from the gold foil industry reads: "We have received the Guangdong Province Business Tax Collection Regulations, which list the scope of gold foil in the third level of goods sales and tax is calculated according to the total business income, etc. After hearing the order, the entire industry was shocked. We think that the gold shop's signboard indicates buying, selling, and exchanging, which is completely floating in nature. Its function is the same as the silver industry, but the price is a hundred times higher than silver. In the past, when paper money was not in circulation, buyers mostly benefited from its light and easy to carry, which could be used as a side product. Gold merchants make jewelry to earn a small amount of money. For the value of the gold, we follow the bank's regulations, buy and make on behalf of others, and cannot take more than the quota. The entire industry relies on credit, buying and selling daily, rotating rapidly, specializing in exchanges, and constantly flowing. Often the capital is not much, but the monthly amount often exceeds millions. If taxed according to the total income, the price of gold will be extremely high, and it will suffer from increased burden. The industry's transactions are all the same gold, and it must be increased more than ten times to be effective. The silver industry is not taxed according to the total income, because it is also a silver coin that is transferred and collected repeatedly and cannot withstand the cumulative tax. We hope that your association's leaders and merchants will not sit idly by and not save us, but argue reasonably and submit a correction so that the bank will calculate the tax according to the capital amount to show fairness and justice for the public" (January 12th)

### Suzhou

Investigate the Hengjing Land Case Thoroughly

Ben Shucheng, a resident of Hengjing Township, reported that Sheng Ke'an, the squad leader of the militia training team in the township, was selling private soil. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the township and seized 200 liang of private soil in the team headquarters, but Sheng Ke'an himself was snatched away by the team's militia. Sheng's wife, Zhu, was detained and sent to the county government for detention. On the 14th, it was discovered that eight liang of the seized opium soil were missing. The truth is unknown. On the 15th, the county government's special commissioner Du, who was in charge of the opium case, summoned the relevant public security officers in the township for interrogation. The results showed that the township police officer Sheng Jianxiong and others were highly suspected, but because Sheng was a current official, the Public Security Bureau's Chief Inspector Qiang Lei was responsible for supervising him, ensuring that he was available at any time, so that a thorough investigation could be carried out.

Regulate the Rickshaw Rental Price

The labor and capital sides of the Wuxian rickshaw industry had a dispute over the rickshaw rental price, which has been unresolved for several months. The County Party Department and the County Government have now set the rickshaw rental price at 35 fen per day as the legal amount based on the actual situation. It will start on February 1st and cannot be changed. The labor side is satisfied with the above regulations, while the capital side is scheduled to convene a general meeting on the 16th for discussion.

### Changshu

Trial of German Causing Disaster Case Opens

On the 29th of last month, a German, Ping Ke, drove his own car, Shanghai City No. 9326, along the Xihu Highway to Yanxiang in Changshu, knocking down and crushing a villager to death. At that time, the German surrendered to the local Public Security Sub-Bureau. After mediation, the German compensated 300 yuan for the funeral expenses. The public office believes that the case concerns human life and is a public prosecution case, and the Public Security Bureau should not have released the perpetrator. The trial was still scheduled to open on the 15th, and the German was arrested by the Public Security Bureau. As a result, he did not arrive. The bureau will now order the guarantee to hand him over.

10,000 Shi of Glutinous Late Rice Exported

According to a recent request from the Rice Industry Association, the Yinxian Food Management Committee reported that there was an excessive amount of glutinous late rice in stock. They requested that another 20,000 shi be transported to Shanghai for sale. After the seventh meeting of the committee, it was decided that in order to take into account the financial situation of the rice industry, permission was granted to continue transporting 10,000 shi for export, but the transport permit will only be issued after the previous glutinous late rice has been fully offset.

### Xiaoshan

300 Farmers Petition

The newly formed sand land in the Nansha area of Xiaoshan is no less than several thousand mu. After the new owners bought it, the issue of renting the sand land to the sand people has not been resolved. Therefore, the flood victims and poor farmers along the river, because they have no way to rent the new sand, once gathered in the county and petitioned the County Party Department, the County Government, and the County Farmers' Association, pleading for assistance. On the morning of the 13th, because the spring flowers they planted were all dug up by the owners, more than 200 people gathered again in the city to make a second petition to maintain the lives of the disaster-stricken farmers.

### West Qing Basketball Tonight

Jinan to Reunite with Maxwell I

The West Qing basketball schedule for last night originally had three matches. The first match was in the Ordinary Group, Mingqiang vs. Yuezhong, which had been brought forward to last Saturday, with Yuezhong winning 45 to 36. Last night's schedule was canceled. The second match, Nanqing, also forfeited due to illness, and Hujiang won without effort. Therefore, in the final match, the Xin team competed against Maxwell II. The Xin team fought with a weakened lineup, falling behind 15 to 18 in the first half and ultimately losing 43 to 30.

Circular to Provincial Party Headquarters for Notification

The Central Executive Committee considers the establishment of sports associations in provinces, cities, and counties to be of utmost importance for the implementation of national physical training.

### Ministry of Education Orders Zang Qifang to Take Over Northeastern University as Soon as Possible

Northeastern Notables to Form Organization to Maintain School Affairs

[Special dispatch from Beiping] Since the new Acting President Zang Qifang came to Beiping, he has been conferring with the authorities and relevant parties in Beiping regarding the takeover of Northeastern University. On the 13th, Zang visited Liu Yifei and others, held talks, and issued a statement explaining his views on the opinions expressed in the previous day's interview with the current secretary and director of the Dongda. The Ministry of Education sent a telegram to Ping, addressed to Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, and Zang Qifang, stating that the ministry has the right to inquire about the president of Dongda, and the authorities have forwarded the telegram and the previous day's telegram from the Ministry of Education to Dongda for compliance. The 25,000 yuan subsidy for Dongda from the Ministry of Education for last month has been remitted to Ping. Zhou Jingwen, the secretary and director of the school, is still working at the school, and rumors of his trip to Beijing are inaccurate. The student union of the school hosted the press, reporting the reasons for opposing the takeover and sending a telegram to Song Ziwen, requesting that the current state of Dongda be maintained. The students also sent representatives to Baoding and Tianjin to visit the university committee members Wan Fulin and Wang Shuhan, requesting them to come to Ping to jointly maintain the existence of Dongda. They returned to Ping on the 14th. The details are as follows:

Ministry of Education Telegram

The Ministry of Education sent a telegram to Ping yesterday regarding the appointment and removal of the president of Dongda, addressed to Song (Zheyuan), Qin (Dechun), and the new president of Dongda, Zang Qifang, explaining everything. The original telegram from the Ministry of Education is recorded below: "True telegram received. The organization outline of Northeastern University has been approved by the ministry, which states that the president should be appointed by the government. The University Committee has no right to inquire. The minister has already telegraphed Song (Zheyuan) and Mayor Qin (Dechun) in detail and requested Brother Xixi to jointly instruct the director of the telegraph bureau to proceed immediately. Xipeng."

Northeastern Notables

Northeastern notables in Ping, Hu Yukun, Liu Yifei, Fu Zhankui, Shao Wenkai, etc., believe that the Ministry of Education's reorganization of Dongda and the appointment of Zang Qifang as acting president are related to the future of the highest institution of learning in the Northeast, and they are deeply concerned that unexpected events will occur due to the takeover. At 11:00 AM on the 13th, they specially hosted a banquet for Zang Qifang in their capacity as fellow villagers, expressing their attitude towards the takeover of Dongda, advocating for peaceful methods, and hoping that the matter would be handled through legal procedures and after the Xi'an Incident is completely resolved and the political situation has a clear trend before discussing the Dongda issue, hoping that Zang would temporarily postpone the takeover to avoid causing unexpected events. The resolution of the Dongda reorganization issue will be discussed and resolved jointly by the University Committee of the school and the Northeastern elders. It is generally speculated that a "Northeastern University Maintenance Association" will be organized, and the association will elect a president to temporarily maintain the school until the political situation is clear before making long-term plans. The school authorities and students are now working hard on this and are actively contacting the University Committee and Northeastern notables.

Zang Qifang's Talk

Zang Qifang told reporters that his trip to Ping to take over Dongda was on the order of the Ministry of Education. When he first received the order, he repeatedly declined because the reorganization of Northeastern University was complicated and he was busy with the Wuxi Special Commissioner's Office. Later, he received an order from the Minister of Education, so he went north. Therefore, everything will be handled according to the wishes of the authorities. When he started his trip north from Nanjing, the Ministry of Education asked him to bring the 25,000 yuan subsidy for Dongda for December. Because it was inconvenient to carry, he remitted it to Ping today. This proves that…

### Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Schedules Distribution of November Education Fees

Scheduled for the 18th and 19th of this Month

The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau announced that the bureau is scheduled to distribute the November regular fees for municipal schools and social education institutions on the 18th and 19th of this month (i.e., Monday and Tuesday). The notice specifies the fee distribution dates and times for different districts and is announced for general knowledge. All schools and institutions are required to report the collection of various fees and the expenditure statements for each month to the bureau before the fee distribution period and come to the bureau to collect the fees on time. Attached is the fee distribution date and time schedule: 18th: Hubei South, Zhabei, Yinxing, Jiangwan, Wusong, Yangjing, Gaohang, Pusong, Zhenru, Caojing (all schools); 19th: Fahua, Luxing, Yinxing, Gaoqiao, Pengpu, Tangqiao, Yangsi, City Center (all schools), municipal social education institutions. The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The educational authorities aim to treat all events equally. According to reports, the current Secretary and Director of Dongda, Zhou Jingwen, made four points in his statement. Regarding the first point, that the president of Northeastern University must be elected by the University Committee and the Ministry of Education has never intervened, the Ministry of Education has sent a telegram to Ping stating that the ministry has the right to inquire about the president of Dongda and ordering the school to comply. Regarding the funding of Dongda, since Dongda was founded in 1922 by Wang Minyuan, the former Governor of Fengtian Province, the school's funding has been paid by the treasuries of Fengtian and Heilongjiang provinces. Therefore, the tuition fees collected from new students from Jilin are more than those from Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces. The claim that President Zhang (Xueliang) raised the funds himself is inaccurate. After the incident occurred, the Ministry of Education, in addition to allocating 25,000 yuan per month (and 25,000 yuan annually), used it to enrich Dongda's equipment. In short, his trip to Ping to take over Dongda was on the order of the Ministry of Education to avoid any misunderstandings and to find a peaceful takeover method, and everything was in accordance with the intentions of the Central Government.

### Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Winter Vacation Training Session for Compulsory Education Workers Opened Yesterday

Director Pan's Speech, Section Chief Jiang's Report, Training Starts Today and Ends at the End of the Month

The Winter Vacation Training Session for Compulsory Education Workers, organized by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, held its opening ceremony at the auditorium of Shangwen Elementary School at 1:30 PM yesterday, attended by Director Pan, Section Chief Jiang, Li Wanyu, Xue Weiran, Qian Fugong, various lecturers, and students such as Ling Hongji and over a hundred others. Section Chief Jiang, as chairman, reported on the preparations. The director gave a speech on the mission of short-term elementary school teachers. The session is scheduled to begin today and end on the 31st of this month. The details are recorded as follows:

Chairman's Report

Section Chief Jiang, as chairman, reported that since the city's short-term elementary schools have been operated concurrently under the orders of the ministry, it has been a year and a half, but the exam results are still not satisfactory. There are many reasons for this, but the human factor is the main reason. Therefore, in order to enable teachers to deeply understand the meaning of short-term elementary schools and strive to serve, a winter vacation training session has been held. Attendees include principals and teachers of short-term elementary schools, teachers of affiliated short-term elementary school classes, and teachers of the two-part system. Most of them are current workers, and a few are selected personnel. There are about 140 participants in total, with girls accounting for one-third. The courses are all about supplementing research and discussion. The training will start on the 16th and end on the 31st, for a total of 16 days. It is hoped that the maximum harvest will be obtained in the shortest possible time. Therefore, it is hoped that everyone will not be absent or take leave. The dormitories are located in Xicheng for boys and Wuben for girls. The daily performance will be examined, and the quality of the performance is related to the assigned work. Therefore, it is hoped that everyone will work hard.

Director's Speech

Director Pan then gave a speech on the importance of compulsory education. Everyone has already taken on this work and should understand the importance of their responsibility. However, according to investigations and inspections, the past results have not been satisfactory. There are certainly many reasons for this. It is hoped that after this training session, everyone will be able to correct the past shortcomings as a result of discussion. The following are a few suggestions for everyone: ⑴ Those in charge of running short-term elementary schools must be faithful. Faithfulness means being loyal and striving in one's duty, recognizing that this work is very important and doing it sincerely and earnestly, without fear of any hardship. In the past, some people could not be faithful in their duties, treating this work as a casual occupation to deal with personal life, without understanding its meaning. For example, some people temporarily pull together and decorate the number of students due to the inability to recruit students. This is unfaithful. It is hoped that after the training session, everyone will be able to put forward discussions at any time to change this phenomenon, and then do things in a pragmatic and down-to-earth manner. ⑵ Teachers of short-term elementary schools must make double efforts. We know that the country is running short-term elementary schools as a last resort. If the country had money, it should enable school-age children to receive six years, at least four years of education. But China does not have money, so they can only receive one year of short-term elementary school education. One year is very short, and the results are already very small. But if teachers do not work hard, it can be said that nothing will be gained. Therefore, everyone must work harder than teachers in ordinary elementary schools, shoulder such a heavy responsibility, and do such difficult work, working hard, fearing that they will not be able to catch up, and must not be negligent. ⑶ Teachers of short-term elementary school classes should not only teach them to read and write, but also teach them the principles of being human. The meaning of education is not just reading and writing. This is only a small part of education. According to the new saying, education is to change the old bad ones and to be the new good ones. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "What Heaven imparts is called Nature; following Nature is called the Path of Duty; cultivating the Path is called Instruction." Instruction is to cultivate the Path, to cultivate the Path of being human. The Path is to follow emotions, to control human nature is the Path, and Nature is inherent. Everyone must use the inherent performance to lead this Nature, which is the Path, and to cultivate this Path is Instruction. Therefore, education is to use acquired methods to remedy the shortcomings and deficiencies of inherent Nature. Students in short-term elementary schools only have this one year of opportunity to receive education, so they must be taught to be human within one year, to become sound citizens. This depends entirely on the teachers, who must be able to set an example to teach them the principles of being human, so that they can read and write and know how to be human. This is the best result. In short, education is a spiritual cause. The more spirit everyone has, the more results there will be. We must work earnestly and strive to live up to the country's expectations.

### Jiangsu Province Education Funds for January to be Issued Within the Month

The January expenses for various Jiangsu provincial middle and primary schools, vocational normal schools, and social education institutions will be issued soon.

### All Sectors in This City Strive for National Salvation Through Unification Movement

Joint Signatures Publish Declaration

Recently, university presidents, professors, primary and secondary school principals, teachers, writers, journalists, and people from industrial and commercial circles in this city, in view of the previous Liangguang and Xi'an incidents, which were all resolved by the central government through political means, believe that the opportunity for unification in our country has clearly become mature. However, the aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu is still awaiting central government planning and disposal, and the Communist Party and frustrated politicians are妄想试图 to take advantage of the remaining feudal forces, hoping to form a separatist situation, which is contrary to the current needs of China. It is generally believed that China has undergone more than 20 years of struggle, sacrificing countless lives and property, to create a unified situation. It will never allow anyone to use any excuse to destroy the unification, and it must be supported by the power of the whole people. Therefore, they have launched the "National Salvation Through Unification Movement" and drafted the "National Salvation Through Unification Declaration," widely soliciting signatures. It is heard that cultural circles in various places are also signing up to join. The original text of the declaration is as follows:

Declaration of National Salvation Through Unification

1.  The crisis of 1936 is over, but the enemy's ambitions have not been extinguished, and the world's war machine is approaching day by day. 1937 will undoubtedly not be a "year of peace." The current issue for us is "What should we do?" We must resolutely resist the enemy and defend ourselves, and we must also work hard to prepare for the current world war. To resist the enemy and defend ourselves, and to cope with the war, we must first achieve the true unification of military orders and political power. Once the war breaks out, the transfer of supplies depends on the convenience of transportation, and the funds and equipment depend on the development of industry. This also requires the national economic construction to catch up. To achieve the goal of economic construction catching up, political power must be absolutely unified. Otherwise, local operations will only give the enemy opportunities to defeat us individually. Backward construction will inevitably lead to a great lack of military supplies. Therefore, our current national salvation work, whether it is resisting the enemy or construction, must take consolidating unification as the first step.

2.  History tells us that without Cavour's unification movement, Italy would not have had the possibility of prosperity. Without Bismarck's central centralization movement, Germany could not have succeeded in the 1870 war. Without the Meiji Restoration's abolishment of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures, Japan could not have jumped into the ranks of the powerful countries. Without Kemal's national revolutionary movement, Turkey could not have escaped the control of Britain and Greece. The current stage of China is just like Italy in the era of Cavour, Germany in the era of Bismarck, Japan in the era of the Meiji Restoration, and Turkey in the era of the national revolution. In terms of Chinese history, the national destiny was prosperous whenever the unification was completed, and it entered a state of decline and chaos and tended to perish when the phenomenon of disintegration occurred. Therefore, China's need for unification is an unshakable truth in this time of urgent crisis. Under this extremely urgent need, we cannot fail to recognize all the forces of "anti-unification."

3.  There are three forces of "anti-unification": ㊀ The remaining feudal warlords, ㊁ The Chinese Communist Party and the so-called "People's Front" or "United Front," ㊂ Traitors who act as accomplices for the enemy, such as Puyi, Yin Rugeng, De Wang, Li Shouxin and others. All three of these should be resisted. However, we still eagerly expect that these people who harbor the intention of anti-unification can have a practical repentance with the renewal of the years, and turn the attempt to obstruct unification into an action to support unification. If the evolution of the facts matches our expectations, and the people of anti-unification can turn around and stand on the front of supporting unification, it will naturally be a great blessing for the country and the nation. If these people are stubborn and unyielding, or accustomed to separatism, or willing to be puppets, or recognize the enemy as their father, or act as accomplices for the enemy and seek glory by betraying the country, then we have no choice but to consistently resist them. We must know that the current unification is only the prototype of unification, but the price that our country and nation have paid for unification has been extremely huge. If we have paid such a large price and still cannot maintain even the prototype of unification, then our past 30 years of revolutionary sacrifices will not become sacrifices without value. We must also know that our enemies are using divisive tactics at any time and anywhere to realize their dream of dividing China and carving up China, so that our country cannot be revived through unification. Therefore, in order to cherish this prototype of unification, and in order to nurture this prototype of unification and make it grow, we will never allow the remaining warlords and shameless politicians to continue their separatism, and we will never allow the Communist Party and traitors who are willing to be puppets and accomplices to run rampant.

4.  It is particularly noteworthy that the warlords used to advocate "joint provincial autonomy" in order to maintain the separatist situation. Today, the Communist Party, in its twilight years, also sings the praises of "People's Front" or "United Front." What is the "People's Front"? It is to incite the people to resist the government in order to destroy the order of the country. What is the "United Front"? It is to unite all the remaining feudal forces in order to obstruct the unification of the country. For example, the Xi'an Incident recently instigated by the Communist Party is a ironclad proof of the Communist Party wearing the guise of "People's Front" and "United Front" to strike at China's unification. How can the Communist Party not know that a country cannot have two governments? If it has the sincere intention of saving the country, why not abolish the "Chinese Soviet?" How can the Communist Party not know that the division of military power and military orders is not enough to fight against foreign enemies? If it has the sincere enthusiasm to resist the enemy, why not abolish the "Red Army?" Moreover, facts speak louder than words. The Communist Party's "Chinese Soviet" and "Red Army" are all manipulated by the evil hand of foreign interference in China's internal affairs. Its essence is no different from the puppet organizations in eastern Hebei and the pseudo-coalition army in Suiyuan. We dare to say that wherever the evil hand of interference in the internal affairs of other countries extends, it is not for the benefit of the country where it is located. There are too many examples of distant events to mention. Just in the recent past, it is enough to make us feel cold. For example, has Spain not become a battlefield for the red and black international forces under the rule of the so-called "People's Front" government? What have the Spanish people gained in this battlefield except for tragic deaths, insecure sleep, and the misfortune of losing their families? Why should we also make the same sacrifices?

5.  It is very clear that China today cannot break the reactionary forces of separatism unless it achieves true unification. With the daily approaching of the international crisis, the work of unification must be completed at an accelerated pace in order to cope with the current difficult situation. Political unification must have economic construction as its foundation in order to be long-lasting. Moreover, our country's backward production and undeveloped transportation have become modern countries, and it is also waiting for the development of construction undertakings. However, if the country does not have a unified political power to guarantee it, it will be difficult to carry out various constructions, or even be destroyed. Therefore, the unification of political power, on the other hand, is a prerequisite for economic construction. Not only resisting the enemy and defending ourselves depends on unification.

From this, we can see that in today's China, there is no way to strengthen the force of resisting the enemy without unification, and there is no way to achieve the results of construction without unification. In a word, only by completing unification can we save China. Therefore, with the arrival of the 26th year of the Republic of China, we dare to shout out the great slogan of "National Salvation Through Unification," hoping that all people in the country, regardless of their profession, can immediately rise up to assist and use the great power of the entire nation to carry out a general mobilization of national opinion, correct any distorted consciousness of any faction, and eliminate any separatist forces in the shortest possible time, regardless of whether they are warlords, traitors, or the Communist Party. We deeply believe that only a consolidated unification is the cornerstone of saving the country. We are willing to do our best to complete this great "National Salvation Through Unification" movement for the entire Chinese nation. January 9, 26th year of the Republic of China.

### University Presidents Telegraph Central Government to Curb the Shaanxi Rebellion

Impose Severe Sanctions on Yang Hucheng

The Central News Agency reports that university presidents in this city, such as Weng Zhilong, believe that the central government's handling of the Shaanxi Incident is very appropriate. Although Zhang Xueliang has expressed remorse, Yang Hucheng is still attempting to resist the order and raise troops. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the central government, requesting that effective methods be adopted quickly to impose severe sanctions. The original telegram is as follows: To the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission: We humbly observe that the central government's handling of the Shaanxi Incident is based on the purpose of preserving national strength while rectifying discipline. Therefore, it is lenient to the masterminds. Zhang Xueliang has already surrendered himself with repentance, hoping for special grace. Yang Hucheng is also a principal, and his dismissal and retention is also an exception. All those who participated in this disaster should be grateful and try to repay. However, Yang Hucheng colluded with bandits and indulged in evil. Since the central government issued the order, his attitude has been ambiguous, and he has not shown any repentance. Recently, he has recklessly expanded the divisions and resisted the order to raise troops, destroying unification. Such harm to the country is truly an enemy of the people. We humbly request that effective methods be adopted quickly to impose severe sanctions to curb the rebellion and demonstrate the rule of law. It is most urgent. Shanghai University Presidents Weng Zhilong, Li Zhaohuan, He Bingsong, Chu Minyi, Hu Wenyyao, Gu Yuqi, Liu Haisu, Qian Yongming, Zhang Shouyong, Ou Yuanhuai, Guo Qiyuan, Chen Jicheng. Liu Zhanen, He Shizhen, Chen Mengyu, Cao Huiqun. respectfully kowtow.

### Cultural Circles Telegraph Central Government to Severely Punish Zhang Xueliang

Swiftly Suppress the Rebels in Shaanxi and Gansu

The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Cultural Circles Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Support Association and the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Major Primary and Secondary Schools jointly telegraphed yesterday, and also telegraphed the central government to severely punish Zhang Xueliang, and to quickly suppress the rebels in Shaanxi and Gansu, to implement the national policy of internal pacification and external resistance, and unification to defend against insults. The text of the telegram is as follows: To all newspapers in the country, and forwarded to the party headquarters and governments of all provinces and cities, all schools, and all groups: A telegram was sent to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission: The Xi'an Incident was insane and its culprits deserved death, as the people of the country all said. However, your association (government) (yuan) thought that Zhang Xueliang escorted Chairman Jiang back to Nanjing and pleaded guilty, and emphasized generosity and advocated peace. It reduced the sentence for the culprit, ordered a special pardon, and strictly supervised him, hoping that he would reform himself. It only ordered the accomplices to be dismissed and retained, and charged them with making meritorious service while bearing the crime. All this was intended to preserve national strength. Who knew that a wolf's ambition would never change. The person under supervision used his deceitful skills, roamed outside the law, and secretly made war, so that the soldiers of the Northeast Army, even if they wanted to obey the central government, could not move forward. In addition, Yang Hucheng occupied the northwest, colluded with bandits, and spread heresy recklessly, and his rebellious traces were obvious. In recent days, the deterioration of the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu and the suffering of the people in the northwest have been reported in newspapers, but it is less than one-hundredth of the truth. If our central government falls into his trick and insists on leniency, then nurturing a tumor will cause trouble, and it will be too late to bite the navel. In governing the army and administering the government, there must be discipline. It is appropriate to declare a punitive expedition for resisting orders and raising troops. It is appropriate to ask your association (government) (yuan) to make a decisive decision, enforce the law, and punish Zhang Xueliang, the culprit for losing the territory, by imposing capital punishment to appease the world. Then, lead the national army to sweep away the rebels, eliminate the bandits, and stabilize the people's livelihood. Those who have not gone far astray and come back should be recruited quickly, treated equally, and work together to make contributions to the country. Internal pacification is the way to resist external aggression, and unification is the way to defend against insults. The entire nation is willing to be the backing, alas, the red flames in the northwest are about to spread. The suppression of bandits on the border has been stopped halfway. Who is to blame for this? Who caused this? There is a saying that if you do not make a decisive decision, you will suffer from it. With the wisdom of your (government) (yuan), how can you not see this? In a moment of crisis, we hope that the whole country will unanimously appeal to uphold discipline and unify to defend against insults. This is the only way to rely on it. Shanghai Cultural Circles Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Support Association • Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Various Universities • Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Secondary Schools • Association of Secondary Schools • Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Primary Schools respectfully kowtow,

I have read with respect. The central government's various measures for handling military and political affairs in Shaanxi and Gansu this time are both disciplined and humane, and they are advancing simultaneously in suppressing bandits and resisting the enemy. It is particularly hopeful that they will cherish the national strength, stabilize local order, understand the hardships of the soldiers, and think of your past. All those who are bloody and ethical are happy and supportive. You have long been known for your loyalty to the government, and you have never been behind in protecting the party and the country. You should be sincere in implementing the central government's orders, set an example for your comrades, and support unification to comfort the people of the country. If you and Mr. Hucheng and Mr. Xiaohou are unwilling to accept such a lenient and comprehensive solution, it is a deliberate resistance to orders. In order to lay the foundation for saving the country and defending against insults, the national public opinion cannot but ask the government to impose severe sanctions on those who resist orders.

### Construction of the Jianle-Chuanqian Railway 建樂川黔鐵路建樂川黔鐵路

Inaugural Meeting Held, Directors and Supervisors Elected; Half of the 20 Million Yuan Capital Raised

With investment from the domestic financial community to construct the Chuanqian Railway, approved by the Ministry of Railways, the Chuanqian Railway Chartered Joint-Stock Company was established with a capital of 20 million yuan, half of which has already been raised. The Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan Provincial Government each invested 2.25 million yuan, and the company was legally established, with the head office located in Shanghai. It is decided that the Chengdu-Chongqing line will begin construction on the first of next month. Our Central News Agency reporter has obtained the following details:

Company Establishment

Sichuan Province possesses abundant resources, known as a land blessed by nature. Unfortunately, under the previous rule of warlords, it could not be developed, and transportation was especially inconvenient. After the establishment of the Sichuan Bureau years ago, various construction projects are being actively carried out, with the construction of railway transportation being particularly urgent. The China Construction Bank then initiated the construction of the Chuanqian Railway. After receiving approval from the Ministry of Railways, it immediately prepared to establish a company to undertake the project. The fixed capital amount is 20 million yuan, with an initial fundraising target of 10 million yuan. In addition to the Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan Provincial Government each subscribing 2.25 million yuan, the remaining 5.5 million yuan was raised in Shanghai. Recently, an inaugural meeting was held, at which directors and supervisors were elected, and the articles of association were approved. These have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and sent to the Central Political Council for record. The company's head office, located in Shanghai, has also begun operations, with three groups: General Affairs, Finance, and Technology, each responsible for their respective departments. However, the organizational charter is still awaiting approval from the Ministry of Railways.

Election of Directors and Supervisors

The company has 19 directors. In addition to the general manager who is a director by default, 11 directors are from commercial shareholders. At the inaugural meeting, Wang Lengbo, Hu Bijiang, Ye Zhuotang, Li Shizeng, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Xinliu, Song Zi'an, Liu Zhujun, Xu Ziqing, Jiang Kui, Yang J眉imei, and others were selected to serve. Seven directors are from government shares, with Zhang Gongquan, Deng Yiguang, and Zeng Yangfu appointed by the Ministry of Railways, and Liu Hangchen, Lu Zuofu, and Gan Jijiong appointed by the Sichuan Provincial Government. One person from the Ministry of Finance has not yet been assigned. Three supervisors were selected, with Wu Yunzhai selected from commercial shareholders, and Du Zhenyuan appointed by the Ministry of Railways and Deng Hanxiang appointed by the Sichuan Provincial Government. The board of directors has held two meetings and elected Zeng Yangfu, Li Shizeng, Song Zi'an, Lu Zuofu, and Liu Zhujun as standing directors. Zeng Yangfu was mutually elected as the chairman of the board, and the board of directors appointed Zeng to also serve as the general manager. Zeng came to Shanghai yesterday to provide instructions on company affairs.

Construction Plan

The railway operated by the company, approved by the Ministry of Railways, will first construct the trunk line from Chengdu to Chongqing, and then gradually expand to build the branch line from Neijiang to Zigong, and the main line from Chongqing to Guiyang. The operating period is 30 years. The Chengdu-Chongqing trunk line, since the establishment of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau for its construction, has now been surveyed and will begin construction on the first of next month. The line is 522.436 kilometers long, and the estimated construction cost is approximately 60 million yuan. In addition to the company's capital of 20 million yuan, a loan of 34.5 million French francs has been obtained from French banking groups, and a contract has already been signed, and orders have been placed for steel rails, etc. from foreign countries. The sleepers used will primarily be domestically produced. The entire project is expected to be completed in two and a half years, and the line should be open to traffic by the summer of 1939. When expanding the main line or branch lines in the future, additional capital will be raised.

The declaration is recorded below:

Declaration of Establishment

The inadequacy of accounting in our country has long been criticized by the world. It is recorded, "The feudal lords hated that it harmed them, so they all removed their registers." Concealing accounts and recording inaccurately is a great evil. However, without standardized systems or open methods, there is no way to verify the truth, and it is difficult to avoid errors and corruption. The impact can be small, leading to the demise of a business, or large, weakening a nation. Government accounting has gradually achieved unification and openness through the efforts of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Audit. However, private enterprises still retain their old ways. In recent years, the collapse of businesses has become increasingly common, with numerous cases of corruption. This has become a hidden concern for society. As personnel become more complex and commerce and industry expand, the past tolerance of concealment and inaccuracy, where even shareholders could not thoroughly review the books, is no longer applicable today. When discussing economic undertakings today, it is necessary to have appropriate and open accounting systems to reveal the true state of finances to guide the direction of management, to safeguard the soundness of enterprises to prevent the occurrence of fraud, and to prove the accuracy of accounts to establish public trust. Recently, the government has started collecting income tax, and the calculation of profits for business enterprises must be based on accurate bookkeeping. In both law and fact, open accounting cannot be avoided. The developed economies of the West have greatly benefited from open accounting. Consider England, where the law stipulates that at least one of the company's supervisors must be an accountant. In the United States, various parties will not recognize financial reports unless they are certified by an accountant. Furthermore, accountants act as notaries, handling tax matters on behalf of both the government and the people, which is a common phenomenon in various countries. We, recognizing the necessity of building the national economy on a sound foundation, and aware that the accounting methods of most companies and firms in our country are still extremely rudimentary, the skills of accountants are still lagging behind, shareholders and creditors are often concerned about being deceived, and the government finds it difficult to verify tax collection, hereby initiate the organization of the Association for Promoting Open Accounting. We broadly gather comrades, mobilize entirely, and engage in the "Open Accounting Movement" based on accounting theory and practical experience. We will formulate simple and unified accounting systems, provide technical assistance to companies and firms nationwide as much as possible, study the laws and regulations of various countries that promote open accounting, actively make legislative suggestions to the government, and instill accounting knowledge to the general public, in order to jointly advance towards the grand path of open accounting and business progress. As the saying goes, "A people without trust cannot stand." It also says, "The world is for all." Open accounting is the way to establish public trust and promote social prosperity. We hold this goal firmly and persevere relentlessly. We hereby announce the reasons for organizing this association to the world. All enlightened comrades in our society, let us come together! We hereby declare.

### The Machine Industry Association Submits an Explanation of Salary Income Tax to the Government

Different Systems for Monthly Wages and Piecework

The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Goods Factories United Association held a general meeting of all members at the New Asia Hotel on the afternoon of the 14th at 8:00 PM, with over 300 people in attendance. Lu Zhixue, Cai Shengbai, and Ji Jiannan were elected as the presidium. The chairman first reported on the association's affairs, followed by speeches by Pan Yangyao and others. Then, they discussed the proposal by the Sanyou Society regarding Article 5 of the Income Tax Regulations on salary income. According to the situation in Shanghai, it is extremely complex, with monthly wage systems, piecework systems, those who only receive salaries, those who receive food, lodging, and transportation expenses in addition to their salaries, those who provide food but not lodging, those who provide lodging but not food, and those who do not provide food or lodging. The question is whether the income tax should be based on the monthly salary income or include food, lodging, and transportation expenses. If so, whether those who provide food but not lodging, those who provide lodging but not food, and those who do not provide food or lodging can deduct their food or lodging expenses from their salaries before paying income tax. Because our company has thousands of employees, according to Item 3 of Article 17 of the detailed rules, employers are required to withhold the tax on their behalf, and the calculation of income tax is progressive, making it extremely difficult with numerous questions. The member factories of our association presumably share these concerns. Therefore, we are taking this opportunity of the delegates' meeting to raise this discussion to seek clarification, or each can submit their questions to the government for explanation, so that those who are obligated to pay and the employers who withhold the tax can have something to follow, and the competent authorities can collect the tax smoothly. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that each factory should collect their opinions and then submit them to the authorities for explanation. Finally, there was entertainment, with the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory performing Chinese martial arts and the Lan Society singing opera. The meeting ended happily at 10:30 PM.

### Gold Exchange Layoffs Opposed by All Staff

Exchange Denies Reorganization Rumors

The Shanghai Gold Exchange, due to a sharp decline in operating income, recently planned to announce layoffs to save expenses and maintain the status quo. The 30th shareholders' meeting is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 31st of this month to report to the shareholders. The exchange's general affairs, accounting, trading, and calculation departments, as well as the document section, have a total of 107 employees, with monthly salaries ranging from 15 to 60 yuan, excluding the heads of departments. It is now rumored that only 20 to 30 people will be retained. All the staff members are opposing the layoffs. They believe that the exchange's operations have been profitable in all years except for 1935, when it was break-even, and 1936, when it incurred losses. Its reserve fund has reached 550,000 yuan. Therefore, they have decided to wait for the board of directors to announce the list and officially announce the layoff plan before deciding on countermeasures. According to the person in charge of the board of directors of the Gold Exchange, who spoke to the New Voice News Agency, the exchange's business is declining, resulting in income not being able to offset expenses. Therefore, reducing staff is a method to save expenses. Retiring employees will be given six months' salary as severance pay, but there is no mention of reorganization.

### Police Organs to be Changed to a Two-Tier System

All Police Stations to Become Branches

Since the Municipal Police Bureau was ordered to change its name, all its branches and stations have also been renamed police branches and police stations. However, there have been no changes in the internal organization. However, due to the large population of the city, the bureau intends to change the existing three-tier system to a two-tier system for the convenience of command and the speed of action, that is, to abolish the police stations and establish them all as police branches. However, the issue of zoning is still under careful consideration, and detailed planning should be carried out for the density of the population and the size of the area. As for the reorganization of the security regiments into security police under the jurisdiction of the police bureau, inquiries with the authorities have revealed that there are no such plans.

### Relief Association Allocates 10,000 Yuan to Help Disaster Victims in Henan Province

The Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charity Groups in this City received a telegram from the Henan Relief Committee yesterday, (details omitted): Telegram received, urgently requesting investigation and collection. Now in the severe winter, the disaster area is in urgent need of relief. Those who come to Bian to eat are in groups of thousands, and several die every day. Although the association has successively provided funds for repatriation, many are willing to die in Kaifeng rather than return to their hometowns. It is really overwhelming. Please quickly allocate a large sum of money and invite Master Dehao to personally distribute it. Greatly anticipating and praying, the Henan Relief Committee's cold weather telegram. After receiving the telegram, the association immediately allocated 10,000 yuan, remitted to Henan through the Bank of China for relief, and replied to the Henan Relief Committee, saying: Zhang Boying and Chang Zhizhen of the Henan Relief Committee, we previously telegraphed that after sufficient funds had been raised, Master Dehao would be invited to inspect and distribute the funds. Because Master Dehao resigned due to an incident and the relief funds were limited, we have specially remitted 10,000 yuan of relief funds raised to your province through the Bank of China, and sent 50 relief tickets from our association. We hope you will inspect and collect them and distribute them in accordance with the regulations. Once the distribution is completed, we hope you will create a register for reimbursement.

### Lawyers Association Announces the Cancellation of Branch Offices

Accounting Books Have Been Prepared and Sold; Communication Addresses Also Cancelled

The Shanghai Lawyers Association issued a notice to all members yesterday, saying: ❶ In order to collect income tax, accounting books have been prepared and sold by the association for standardization. Regarding the income tax for self-employed professionals, which has been levied since January 1 of this year, all members should calculate the income tax payable based on the amount of income, deducting the deductible amounts, and pay it in full. Discrepancies in the accounts of income and expenditure will lead to disputes. Therefore, the association has assigned personnel to design and prepare two types of accounting books, namely the journal and the subsidiary ledger, which make it easy to record income and expenditure amounts and calculate the tax payable. Detailed instructions on how to record and deduct items in accordance with the Income Tax Regulations are attached to the front of the book for reference. Each type of accounting book has 50 pages and is bound in one volume, priced at 60 cents in national currency. They have been sold at the association at No. 30 Gao Naiyi Road, Shanghai, since January 16 of this year. Hereafter, all members using income and expenditure accounting books should purchase and use the aforementioned accounting books for standardization. Corresponding letter for compliance. ❷ Regarding the deadline for canceling branch offices or communication addresses, if they are found after the deadline, the court prosecutor's office should be reported for investigation. In the case of members Zhu Wende, Zhang Guangzong, Mao Jiaju, Tao Muxia, Yu Zhongluo, Zhou Xiao'an, Tang Youwei, and others proposing to notify members to close down branch offices and communication addresses, it has been found that the establishment of branch offices and communication addresses by members is detrimental to morality and has long been banned by the association. While some have complied, many have turned a deaf ear. If the old situation is allowed to continue, the association's resolution will be as good as a document, and the association's prestige will be reduced invisibly. At this time of repeated orders to rectify the lawyer's code of conduct, members' branch offices and communication addresses seem to need strict prohibition. It is specially co-signed to propose that all members with branch offices or communication addresses should close them down by the deadline in order to rectify the code of conduct. Is this appropriate? Awaiting public decision. Based on this, the association decided to inform all members that they should cancel branch offices and communication addresses by the deadline. If they still exist after the deadline, the court prosecutor's office will be reported for investigation. Corresponding letter for compliance. Please comply and cancel them within two weeks in order to rectify the code of conduct. If any are found to exist after the deadline, they will only be reported to the court prosecutor's office for investigation. Please do not violate this.

### Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to the French Municipal Council to Negotiate National Medicine Donation

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council yesterday, saying: On the 4th of this month, according to a letter from the National Medicine Industry Association in this city, the French Concession Municipal Council suddenly collected a donation for the Chinese medicinal materials and pharmaceutical sales regulations from the national medicine stores last summer, ranging from 25 yuan to 10 yuan per year, and the collection was urgent, causing public dissatisfaction. The industry in the entire district felt that this donation was not only illegal, but also during a time of commercial decline and difficult maintenance, they had no extra energy to bear this heavy burden. Therefore, they requested the association to argue on the basis of reason to achieve the goal of cancellation. The association sent two letters and sent representatives to negotiate, but they were not received and there was no reply. The Chinese Ratepayers Association in the French Concession once mediated, but it was too far away and had no effect, so it was delayed. At the end of the year and the beginning of the year, when business is busy, the bureau sent Chinese and foreign personnel to threaten to cut off water and electricity if they violated the rules, forcing the stores to pay by the deadline. The situation was fierce. Therefore, an emergency meeting was held on the 8th and 9th of this month and decided that if the French authorities insisted on suppressing them with barbaric means, the entire industry would take collective resistance actions when necessary. In addition to sending separate letters to the Municipal Council and reporting to the Municipal Party Department and the Bureau of Social Affairs, we are hereby reporting to your association, requesting you to urgently devise a way to stop it and maintain business. Based on this, the bureau recently collected donations for Chinese medicinal materials and pharmaceuticals. Our association has not determined whether it is appropriate because it does not know the detailed regulations. However, at a time when business is declining in the French Concession and when it is customary to close accounts, suddenly using the cutting off of water and electricity as a tool to force the donation may incite incidents. The bureau will gain nothing from this, and it will also have a significant impact on business order. In addition to advising the industry association to make reasonable requests and not take extreme measures, we are corresponding to the situation, requesting your bureau to quickly stop it, and hope to reply.

### Chen Qiucao's Painting Exhibition for Assisting Sui Concludes

The famous painter Chen Qiucao, feeling the need to aid the Sui War, held a painting exhibition of more than 100 of his recent works at the gallery on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road from New Year's Day. He was willing to donate half of the proceeds from the sale of tickets and paintings to Sui. For a time, the audience was enthusiastic and highly praised. The painting exhibition ended on the 11th. It was found that 1,875 tickets were sold in nine days, equivalent to 187.5 yuan, and the actual receipt from the sale of paintings was 234.24 yuan, half of which totaled 210.87 yuan. It has been remitted in full. According to Chen's report, his feelings about this painting exhibition were that the audience's understanding of the meaning of his actions was not as important as he had imagined, and that most of the exhibits were works that expressed emotions and feelings, which slightly hindered the desire to sell paintings. Now that the results are like this, although it does not help much, it is already commendable. He deeply hopes that fellow artists will have a greater response and expression.

### Jia Yi Opium Dealers Seized at the Old Longhua Station

Even with Such Strict Prohibitions, They Still Dare to Transport and Sell Opium

At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, two passengers, Jia and Yi, came to the Old Longhua Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. They were having tea at a small teahouse near the station. When the third and fourth class passenger train from Shanghai to Hangzhou arrived at the station, they bought tickets to Zhouwangmiao and boarded the train. However, their behavior was anxious and panicked, so they were noticed by the railway police. The plainclothes detectives on the train, who had been notified in advance, secretly observed them closely. Before the train started, passenger Jia had already fled without a trace out of fear, abandoning a leather bag in carriage number 41. It was then found by the waiter, who handed it over to the stationmaster. When it was opened, it was found to contain 70 small packets of opium, weighing about three and a half kilograms. Passenger Yi was caught by the plainclothes detectives and had 50 to 60 packets of opium, weighing about three kilograms, confiscated.

### Diphtheria Found in This City, Health Bureau Actively Preventing It

Hunan Office Opens New Prevention and Treatment Room; Establishes Nutrition Department to Pay Attention to Citizens' Health

The Municipal Health Bureau pays great attention to the health of citizens and public health facilities throughout the city. Now, the Hunan District Office of the Bureau has opened a new treatment room for the prevention of diphtheria, and established a nutrition department. Details are as follows:

Preventing Diphtheria

At a time when the climate is abnormal, diphtheria has been repeatedly found in this city. The office, recognizing that diphtheria is most easily spread, and if not prevented, will cause endless harm, has opened a new diphtheria prevention clinic. It is open every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. If citizens want to prevent the occurrence of diphtheria, they can go for examination within the specified time, free of charge. If, after examination by a doctor, it is believed that there is a possibility of contracting diphtheria, preventive injections will be given, also free of charge. The immunity of this injection lasts for about seven years.

Instructions for Preventing Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis is the most terrible disease. According to the office's statistics, 1,091 people died from tuberculosis in 1936, more than any other disease. Second, 574 people died from typhoid fever. Other infectious diseases such as diphtheria (113 people) and smallpox (87 people) had lower mortality rates. The office is now cooperating with the Anti-Tuberculosis Association to set up an anti-tuberculosis clinic, which is open every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, hosted by expert Dr. Chen Changxin. Currently, more than 30 people go for treatment each time. For those with mild illnesses, the doctor will provide instructions on various treatment methods. For those with serious illnesses, they will be transferred to sanatoriums for treatment. The office also has X-rays for perspective and photography of patients with lung diseases. (Perspective fee is 1 yuan, free for the poor; photography fee is 5 yuan.) It is completely free for examination and instructions on treatment methods. If lung disease is found in a family, the office can be notified, and a nurse will be sent to the home to provide instructions on prevention methods, also free of charge.

Establishing a Nutrition Department

In order to promote the health of citizens, the office has also stipulated that doctors will be assigned to conduct physical examinations for citizens every Saturday morning, with a fee of 1 yuan. Recognizing that children in the city are malnourished, resulting in weakness and deficiency, a nutrition department has been established. The detailed regulations will be announced soon. It is planned to start with school children and then extend to various agencies and groups. Citizens can send letters for inquiries.

### Widespread Severe Flu Among Japanese Residents

The Shanghai Japanese Daily reports that the deadly influenza spreading across Europe and America has reached this city. Over the past few days, numerous cases have emerged. During the years 1918 and 1919, the virulent Spanish flu raged through Europe and America, causing numerous deaths. The cases in this city are comparatively milder. According to Dr. Ooi, director of the Japanese Civic Association Clinic, dozens of patients (Japanese only) have sought treatment in the past few days. He suspects the actual number of those infected must be much higher. Initial symptoms include inflammation of the throat, trachea, and bronchi, gradually affecting the gastrointestinal system, causing sudden vomiting and diarrhea, resembling typhoid fever. Some also experience discomfort in joints and muscles. Patients have very high temperatures lasting for extended periods. Currently, there are no effective preventative methods in scientific practice. It is hoped that everyone will pay special attention to hygiene.

### Xiaoshan Kidnapping Case Solved, Ransom Returned

A Group of People Escorted to Hangzhou

The kidnapping gang that was operating out of a tenement house at No. 26 Puqing Lane, Malan Road in the French Concession, was busted earlier this month by the Detective Division of the Municipal Police Department. The kidnapped boy, Sun Guantong, (11 years old), was rescued on the spot. Several male and female kidnappers were arrested in succession. During a search conducted in Xiaoshan, four Mauser pistols and over a hundred bullets were seized. They are being temporarily held at the police station. Special officers Jin Zimei and Wang Chuanzhong and squad leader Zhou Xiaochang, dispatched by the Xiaoshan County government where the incident occurred, arrived in Shanghai yesterday with six armed officers. They officially notified the Municipal Police Department to take custody of the criminals. The victim's mother, Sun Chen, accompanied them and reclaimed her beloved son. This morning, the group boarded the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to escort the criminals back to the Xiaoshan County government for prosecution.

### Conspiracy to Defraud Willie Watch Store, Police Prosecute Two on Multiple Charges

Public Endangerment and Conspiracy to Commit Robbery - Suspects Questioned Yesterday, Further Hearings Pending

Lu Liankui, the Chinese Inspector of the Public Safety Bureau, Detectives Wang Chengying, Wang Jinsheng and others, previously arrested two bandits, Huang Hongsheng and Song Genfa, in Room 21 of the Liangxi Inn on Hubei Road. They confiscated a handgun, seven bullets, and a bomb. Upon interrogation, it was revealed that the gun was provided by Wang Caixi, the owner of the Longquan Teahouse at No. 1 Shangde Lane, Xinji Road. Wang was subsequently apprehended and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing in the first criminal court, with Wang Caixi hiring lawyer Fan Gang for his defense. Lawyer Ru Baoyi, representing the police, stated that the confiscated bomb posed an imminent danger of explosion, and the police took emergency measures to hand it over to the water patrol police for destruction in the Huangpu River. The accused possessed the explosive device with the intention of robbing Willie Watch Store at No. 117 Nanjing Road, and were apprehended by the police while gathering accomplices. Therefore, they are being prosecuted under Articles 187 and 328 of the Criminal Code for public endangerment and conspiracy to commit robbery, and should be severely punished. Huang Hongsheng and Song Genfa confessed to the charges presented by Lawyer Ru. Song also stated that the handgun was supplied by Wang Caixi, but Wang firmly denied it, claiming that he had a feud with Song due to a fight, and was being falsely accused. He presented He Jianmin as proof that Song and Wang had indeed fought on May 5th of the previous year. Lawyer Ru of the police stated that Wang had been arrested by the police for a previous firearms offense, proving his inherent instability, and requested that the hearing be adjourned. Judge Feng, after reviewing the report, ordered that the hearing be adjourned for one week.

### The Continents of Europe and Asia Are Constantly Moving

Director of Xujiahui Observatory Discusses With Western Reporters Yesterday - Claims to Have Measured One-Twentieth of the Earth's Surface

The North-China Daily News reports that Father Lejay, the director of the Xujiahui Observatory, member of the French Academy of Sciences, and Doctor of Science, returned to Shanghai a few days ago after being away for nearly two years. During this period, he attended various conferences and continued his research in Europe and Asia Minor. Yesterday (the 14th), when interviewed by a reporter from the North-China Daily News, he made an astonishing announcement regarding his gravity measurement work: "I have measured one-twentieth of the Earth's surface." The doctor stated that upon returning to Europe, he first attended the International Astronomical Union conference in Paris, where the issue of continental drift was discussed. Wegener's theory is particularly intriguing to the general public because it suggests that the eastern coast of South America and the western coast of Africa were once part of a larger continent that split apart, and that continents are constantly moving. For example, the Americas move westward by about one meter each year. A thorough investigation of this theory is estimated to take fifty years. When the doctor presented his theory, the scientific community was shaken. He based it on the precise records of star transits between Xujiahui and major European observatories, concluding that the continents of Europe and Asia are constantly moving. As a result, the distance between Paris and Shanghai differs by approximately 30 meters each month. The difference in longitude is determined by drawing a perpendicular line from the Earth's center to the location in question. There are three main theoretical reasons for this: ㊀ Atmospheric disturbances can cause the direction of stars to be deflected from their correct position when they pass through the vertical plane due to the refraction of starlight. ㊁ Objects inside the Earth can affect the perpendicular line drawn from the Earth's center, causing the Earth's center of gravity to shift due to the movement of these objects. ㊂ Due to crustal movement, the distance between two cities is constantly changing. The Xujiahui Observatory is still studying this issue. In September 1935, the doctor attended a leadership conference on meteorology in Warsaw, known as the "Conference of Directors." The main purpose of this conference was to organize a global meteorological center to contribute to the development of aviation. It is important to organize climate forecasting and climate condition reporting so that continents can be connected, which is a necessary factor for air travel. The doctor said, "We must take a leading position in aviation. The opening of the air route between the United States and Manila has made a great impression on the meteorological community and made it more important than ever to organize direct traffic, standardized codes, and observation times." The doctor also discussed gravity measurements, saying that he plans to first measure a large part of the upper-level Far East, French Syria, and part of Palestine. While he was in Syria, he was suddenly attacked by bandits one night, who stole all his money. Unexpectedly, a team of British police appeared in the darkness and drove the bandits away. Fortunately, the bandits did not touch the gravity measurement equipment. He has measured one-twentieth of the Earth's surface, establishing gravity measurement points every 50 to 100 kilometers. A renowned Dutch scientist has also conducted similar research underwater using submarines. They hope to measure the entire Earth in the next five to ten years with the help of other scientists in this field. This science can solve many problems concerning the size of the Earth, the internal composition of the Earth, and the Earth's balance. The doctor then took a notebook and a pencil, pointing out the location where he had discovered an earthquake, or the cause of an earthquake. The doctor said that at a certain distance under the Earth's crust, there is a point that can be called the equilibrium layer, where the pressure from above is almost equal. When there is a high mountain, its pressure will naturally increase, and the result is a kind of depression in this equilibrium layer to offset it. This is the norm, but when the equilibrium layer encounters a solid rock structure, it cannot form this offsetting depression. Therefore, this rock structure in a place where pressure is not constant, because it is overloaded, splits from time to time. The waves emitted from this split reach the ground and become an earthquake.

The doctor also studied the amount of ozone in the atmosphere. Two years ago, the Xujiahui Observatory discovered that the amount of ozone in the atmosphere in Shanghai is greater during anticyclones and smaller during low-pressure systems. This is the opposite of what has been discovered in Europe. What is the reason? The amount of ozone at the North Pole is several times that of the equator. The doctor's theory is that ozone moves with anticyclones. The ozone in Shanghai comes from Siberia and reaches the equator, while in Europe it comes from the Azores. When the doctor's theory was first published, it surprised scientists, who had long believed that the upper atmosphere was stationary and that changes in ozone were caused by changes in local solar radiation. Recently, Piccard and the National Geographic Society balloonists discovered strong winds blowing in the so-called stratosphere, which confirmed the doctor's theory. The doctor said that he intends to continue to study this point, because if the movements recorded in the stratosphere correspond accurately to those recorded in the lower atmosphere, the movements of the lower atmosphere can be predicted more accurately. He will also continue to study the amount of moisture absorbed in the air and try to solve the problem of determining the total amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. The reporter then asked the doctor to say a few words about the solar eclipse. The doctor said that the next solar eclipse in China will be in 1941, and a total eclipse will be visible in Fuzhou. At that time, famous astronomers from all over the world will come to China to observe the phenomenon. He will work with them to further this field of study.

### Hit-and-Run Truck Accident, Female Worker Crushed to Death

Xiao Fengying's Body Examined Yesterday - Police Investigating the Fleeing Vehicle

Xiao Fengying, a 19-year-old woman from Taizhou, worked at the Dakang Yarn Factory in Pudong. Early the previous morning, around 6:00 AM, after completing her night shift, she and her fellow villager, Ding Zixiao, were returning to their factory dormitory to rest. As they were crossing Yangshupu Road, 100 yards east of Gelan Road, from south to north, a truck loaded with fishmongers sped eastward from the fish market. Due to its excessive speed, it was unable to avoid Xiao and knocked her to the ground, causing severe injuries. Although passersby witnessed the accident and shouted for the truck to stop, the driver ignored them and sped away. The license plate number could not be identified at the time. Later, someone reported the number as 948. The Chinese police summoned an ambulance to the scene and rushed the woman to Shengxin Hospital, but her injuries were too severe, and she died en route. The Yangshupu police were notified and ordered an investigation. The body was transported to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang, dispatched by the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. Yuan Longsheng, Ding Zixiao, and others testified that they witnessed the car accident. Wang Sha, who provides meals at the Dakang dormitory, stated that she was from the same village as the deceased and has contacted her family. She requested temporary custody of the body. Mr. Tang approved the request, ruling that the deceased, Xiao Fengying, was a female who died from being crushed by a truck before her death. The body was handed over to Wang Sha for burial, and the relevant police department should continue to investigate the fleeing vehicle and handle the case accordingly.

### Child Bride's Lover Accuses Father-in-Law of False Accusation

Bound with Ropes and Forced to Write a Note - Chen A'quan Files a Complaint with the Police Station

Yesterday, Chen A'quan, a 22-year-old man from Shaoxing who resides at No. 845, Shengxing Lane, Yongxing Road, Zhabei, and owns the Quanchang Hardware Factory, filed a complaint with the Xin Zha Branch, stating that he was falsely accused of adultery and defrauded of money, requesting the authorities to arrest the culprit and prosecute him according to the law. Chen stated that he had been running a factory in Zhabei for several years. On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, at around 11:00 PM, Jiang Huaidang, an unemployed rogue residing at No. 10 in the same lane, invited him to his house for a New Year's Eve dinner. They first plied him with alcohol until he was drunk, and then invited people to tie him up with ropes, falsely accusing him of having an affair with his child bride. They took 74 yuan in legal tender from his wallet and forced him to write three promissory notes. Chen stated that he was unable to resist, so he earnestly requested the police to arrest the defendants and prosecute them according to the law. After reviewing the report, the bureau immediately ordered Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the Sixth Division of the Detective Brigade, to dispatch squad leader Liu Bingyuan and detectives Wu Songshan and Miao Yizhong to Shengxing Lane, Yongxing Road, to arrest Jiang Huaidang. However, Jiang had already fled out of guilt. Only Jiang's wife, Ms. Yi, and child bride, Jiang Xiaomei, were brought to the station. According to Ms. Yi, 33 years old, from Zhenjiang, Chen A'quan calls me "auntie," but it's not a formal arrangement. However, he often comes to my house to play, and I didn't know they had an improper relationship. On the night of the 9th of this month, I heard footsteps upstairs. I called my husband (Jiang Huaidang) to investigate and called Wang Xiaoqing and Wang Zaiqing to tie A'quan up with ropes and put him on the floor. I asked him what he was going to do, and A'quan said he was willing to compensate. Later, they found someone to write three promissory notes, one for 20 yuan, one for 30 yuan, and one for 50 yuan. These three promissory notes have already been torn up. There is also a red one with Chen A'quan's fingerprint on it. When they were tied up, Lian Xiaomei was also tied up together, and she wasn't wearing any clothes. As for the wallet, it did exist, I heard them say there was ten yuan, but they returned it to him at the time. I heard that the person who wrote the notes was given one yuan. Jiang Xiaomei, 15 years old, from Chongming, said that that night I went out to soak my feet, and Chen A'quan followed me upstairs. I had an affair with him four or five times between June, July, August, and September of last year. This time, they tied us together with hemp ropes. Asking someone to write the note was done downstairs, I didn't know about it. Wang Xiaoqing, also admitted that Jiang's sister-in-law asked me to help write the paper. I saw three white ones and one red one, but I didn't get any reward from them. They said they would thank me in a few days. The team believes that the case involves serious charges of false accusation and fraud, so they need to summon additional witnesses for verification.

### Fishmonger Truck Accident Driver Sentenced

Two Years Imprisonment

Yang Yuding from Xuzhou, on the 8th of this month, at one o'clock in the morning, was driving a No. 17119 truck, loaded with thirty fishmongers, to the fish market. While passing through Yangshupu Road, Qiupu Road, he carelessly swerved to avoid Li Yuanhao's bicycle. The front of the truck struck a large tree on the side of the road, causing the entire truck to overturn. This resulted in injuries to the fishmongers on board, including Shao Heshang, and also caused Li Yuanhao to suffer a fatal head injury. The police filed charges against Yang for negligent injury at the First Special Court. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, this case was continued to be heard in the Fifth Criminal Court by Judge Ye Shengchao. Because Li Yuanhao died from his injuries, Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police separately charged him with the crime of causing death through professional negligence under Article 276, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Witnesses Yuan Dongcai and Yang Heqing testified that Yang was driving at a speed of 30 yards at the time. When questioned, Yang Yuding said that he had already avoided Li's bicycle, but he did not know how Li hit the back of his truck. Judge Ye, after reviewing the evidence, sentenced Yang Yuding to two years of imprisonment for causing death through professional negligence.

### Robbery at a Nunnery

Losses Exceed 2,000 Yuan

The Xiahai Temple on Donghaimao Road in Pudong is a nunnery with over twenty nuns. They usually rely on offerings from prayers and incense, which are sufficient. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, it was targeted by robbers. Three of the robbers were armed with guns, while two were unarmed. They spoke with a northern accent and wore varying styles of long and short gowns. At the time, all the nuns were asleep, so they did not notice the robbers entering the temple. By the time they woke up, they were no longer free. All twenty-plus nuns in the temple were bound by the robbers, with one robber guarding them with a gun while the remaining robbers searched and looted. After about an hour, they fled with their loot. The nuns struggled to untie themselves and regain their freedom. After inspecting their losses, they found that over 2,000 yuan had been stolen. They immediately reported the incident to the relevant police station, requesting an investigation.

### Municipal Detective Team Successfully Captures Extortionists

Wang Lin Reports to Police Officer, Zhang Juchun and Five Others Arrested

Liu Huai, the team leader of the Municipal Police Detective Team, recently received a report from Wang Lin, a woman from Ningbo who runs a bone shop on Fuyou Road. She stated that between the 5th and 8th of this month, she received threatening letters demanding money. The initial demand was for 800 yuan, which was later increased to 2,000 yuan. The letters instructed her to deliver the money to Room 307 of the Zhonghui Building at the Big Clock Tower. Upon receiving the report, the team ordered the leader of the Third Team, Shan Bin, and detective squad leaders Wu Xiufeng, Gao Jinsheng, and Lu Daquan to investigate. They disguised themselves and secretly went to the specified location to meet with the extortionists. The extortionists were unsuspecting, and after negotiations, the amount was reduced to 2,000 yuan. The officers, together with the relevant police station detectives, lay in wait. At around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Wang Lin went to deliver the money, and Zhang Juchun, Ding Quanbo, Bao Funian, and three other men arrived to collect the money. They were all arrested and taken in for questioning. They confessed that they had accomplices. Yesterday morning, another suspect, Li Binyao, was arrested at No. 4 Yuqing Lane, Xietu Road, and taken back to the station for interrogation.

### Two Lawyers Released from Responsibility After Shi Liang Surrenders

Court Decides Not to Prosecute - Bail Money to Be Returned

After female lawyer Shi Liang was arrested for political activities along with Shen Junru and others, the Third Branch of the High Court ordered lawyers Zhang Zhirang and Tang Hao to bail her out. She then left Shanghai and failed to appear in court. The Procuratorate of the Third Branch of the High Court transferred the case to the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court. Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang summoned lawyers Zhang and Tang to the court and ordered them to each pay 500 yuan in cash as bail, setting a deadline for them to hand over Shi Liang to the court. Later, because they could not find her to hand over the case, Shi Liang wrote a personal letter to Zhang and Tang, requesting them to hand over the case. Due to her suffering from hemoptysis, she applied for an extension. However, Shi still failed to appear after the extension expired. The Procuratorate of the Second Special Court intended to investigate and prosecute the two guarantors, but Shi directly surrendered to the Jiangsu High Court in Suzhou and was detained for interrogation. Later, the Jiangsu High Court notified the Second Branch of the High Court to inform the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court that Shi had surrendered. After learning that Shi had indeed surrendered, Zhang and Tang also filed a request with the First Special Court Procuratorate to be released from their bail obligations. It is now reported that the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court has decided not to prosecute lawyers Zhang Zhirang and Tang Hao. The written decision has been delivered by the police, and the bail money paid by Zhang and Tang has been approved for return.

### Formal Husband and Wife Cannot File Private Lawsuit

Ba Ruibao Sues Ye Shenglin - Case Not Accepted After Investigation

Ye Shenglin, a 27-year-old man from Taicang, previously hired lawyer Li Zhongwen to file a complaint with the Second Special Court against Tang Jinfu, the owner of the Jinjiantou store at No. 149 Xinqiao Street, for inducing a married woman to leave her family. The reason for the lawsuit was that Ye's wife, Ba Ruibao, had married Ye at the age of seventeen and lived with him for three years, giving birth to a son. Later, Ba suddenly absconded with valuables and disappeared without a trace. Although Ye searched everywhere, he could not find her. Ye has now learned that his wife, Ba Ruibao, was induced by Tang Jinfu, the owner of the Jinjiantou store, and introduced to Zhou Zhaozhang, the owner of the Jincheng Milk Shed in Shanghai, to be his concubine. Therefore, he is suing. However, before this case could be heard, Ba Ruibao also hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special Court's criminal division against Ye Shenglin for obstruction of freedom and attempted fraud, stating that Ba was betrothed to Ye at the age of seventeen by her mother. However, Ye neglected his duties. When Ba came of age, he denied the marriage contract. Therefore, Ba went out to work as a domestic servant to make a living in 1935. On December 5th of last year, Ye colluded with Tang Jinfu, the owner of the Jinjiantou store, under the pretext of a conversation, and took the opportunity to detain Ba at the Xin Zha police station. After inquiring and learning that it was a marriage dispute, the police refused to accept the case. Ye then took Ba to Room 4 of the Hongxiang Hotel in Chengqiao, Beihu, and detained her overnight, depriving her of her freedom and demanding 600 yuan. It was not until the next day that she managed to escape. He committed Article 302 of the Criminal Code. Previously, when the Second Special Court summoned Ye Shenglin to hear his lawsuit against Tang Jinfu, they learned that Ba Ruibao had filed a separate lawsuit in the First Special Court. Therefore, they ordered the hearing to be postponed until the First Special Court case was concluded. Yesterday afternoon, the First Special Court heard Ba Ruibao's lawsuit against Ye Shenglin for obstruction of freedom. Ba initially denied that she had lived with Ye or had a child. However, because the facts were undeniable, she admitted that she had lived with Ye and had a son. However, the son had long since been given to someone else. When questioned, Ye Shenglin said that Ba Ruibao was his wife, they had been married for a long time, and the son born to them was still being raised by him. Finally, lawyer Li Zhongwen, the defense lawyer for the defendant Ye Shenglin, stated that since the plaintiffs and defendants are formally married, a private lawsuit cannot be filed according to the law and should be dismissed. After the two lawyers debated the procedure, Judge Ji ruled that the case was not accepted.

### Central Savings Society Lottery Drawing Yesterday

Special Prize: 13132 - Won Exclusively by Wang Anji of Shanghai

The Central Savings Society's tenth lottery drawing was held publicly at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Zong Boxuan, members of the board of directors of the Central Trust Bureau, Chen Xing (representing Liang Ping), Ye Zhuotang, members of the supervisory committee of the Central Trust Bureau, Li Fuxun, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, deputy directors of the Central Trust Bureau, Zhang Du, Liu Gongyun, and over a thousand depositors attended. Zhou Qian, Li Zhen, Feng Yulun, Zhang Qinye, and others were selected as representatives of the depositors to go on stage to supervise the lottery drawing and inspect the lottery balls. Because the society's business has grown rapidly, and the number of numbers has increased significantly, the original copper balls were too small. Therefore, special large-sized lottery balls were cast, which were one-half larger than the balls used before. A leaf plate was added inside the balls to mix the number beads during the drawing. Because this period is January, the society prepared exquisite monthly calendars and distributed them to depositors and guests. At that time, the winning numbers were reported loudly in Mandarin by the announcer and recorded on the blackboard. The special prize, number 13132, was reportedly won exclusively by Wang Anji, the owner of a Shanghai bank, for 25,000 yuan. Winning depositors can bring their passbook and the payment receipt for this month to the society to collect their winnings immediately.

### Grains

Flour and Wheat Plunge, Actual Sales Stagnate, Bulls Panic, Final Estimates of Australian Wheat Released

In the flour market, quotations for foreign wheat fell by 245 jiao or more in Chicago and by 34 jiao or so in Canada. After the opening price was set, actual sales in the domestic market were either high or inconvenient for handling due to the continuous weakness of foreign wheat. As this month is approaching the delivery date, off-market bulls have no choice but to close out their positions. Therefore, the opening price has been continuously weak, falling by an average of 23 fen compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the market had plunged again. Off-market bulls, seeing that actual sales were not active and could not be suppressed any longer, actively sold off positions for this month and February. Other customers, due to settlement reasons, were unable to absorb the selling pressure, and March and April also fell sharply due to their proximity. In the end, all contracts fell by 678 fen or more. Judging from the current situation, the bulls cannot exert their influence without the support of actual sales, so the subsequent situation is likely to be forced to decline further. It is estimated that trading volume today reached 8.92 million bags due to the sharp decline.

The wheat market remained quiet and ultimately showed a soft trend, with a sharp decline in the afternoon. At the opening price, both January and February saw short selling and no trading. Although there was some trading in March, there was no inflow or outflow. In April and June, sentiment was soft and weak, falling slightly by 34 fen. By the afternoon opening, market sentiment suddenly became unstable. Due to the major changes in the flour market and the collapse of the bulls, wheat market sentiment was also dimmed and lifeless, and the bulls were actively selling off, with the decline reaching about 1 jiao. Compared to the initial price this year, this month's contract has fallen by 2 jiao 9 fen, February by 3 jiao 6 fen, March by 3 jiao 9 fen, and April by 4 jiao 1 fen. This shows that the reaction after the overvaluation is also quite remarkable. The wheat market remains quiet, with only sporadic transactions and few large-scale sell-offs. Factories are only handling a few hundred bags, with prices down slightly by 35 fen.

Reuters, New York, 14th: Chicago wheat prices fell by 8.75 to 1.275 due to soft foreign markets and excessive long liquidations.

Also on the same day, Reuters, London: The final official estimate of Australian wheat and planting area was released as follows:

Early Indica Rice Arrives in Large Quantities, Sales Are Also Brisk

Yesterday, the supply of early indica rice continued to be strong, with another 340,000 bags arriving in the past two days. As inventories gradually increase, sentiment is generally soft, and the market has shown signs of stabilizing. However, yesterday, the trading of early rice turned active, and brokers from Shantou had strong demand, with about 3,000 bags traded. Brokers from Guangdong also handled about 2,000 bags of machine-milled rice. The local market also became active, and speculators were also making inquiries. As a result, trading turned brisk, and the market was able to hold its ground. The total volume of Gan rice opened for trading throughout the day was more than 6,000 bags, Xiang rice 1,200 bags, Han brown rice 417 bags, Wenzhou indica rice 2,000 bags, and small-grain rice 1,000 bags.

River Rice Prices Show Little Fluctuation

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total supply from various sources reached over 60 providers, with approximately 12,7800 dan of goods, including more than 10 providers of thin rice. The local market was slightly active because the end of the month had passed, and brokers from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places bought nearly 3,000 bags of thin rice. Therefore, although the market is stable, the situation has become firm. Thick and thin japonica rice, as well as Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan rice, showed no signs of distress.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 45 or 46 providers of river rice from various sources. The sales volume in the local market remained normal. Those who skillfully handled white japonica rice had some transactions, and the market was stable. Those who wanted to sell lowered prices by a few fen. The prices of top-quality thin rice were stable, while medium and lower qualities showed a weak trend. Early rice was flat and weak, white yuan rice was soft and weak, and other indica rice and other goods showed little fluctuation.

Large Quantities of Grain Shipped to Southern Guangdong

Three-Star Yarn Plunges 12-13 Yuan, Golden Rooster February Contract Alone Rises by 1 Yuan, Near-Term Rises While Far-Term Falls, Again Showing Inverted Structure

Due to the abundant harvests in the inland regions this year, the amount of grain coming to Shanghai from the Yangtze River is congested. Sales to both the northern and southern trading groups are very good. In the northern regions, more than 1 million bags of flour and more than 600,000 bags of rice and beans have been shipped from Shanghai in the past three months. In recent two weeks it has been a bit stagnant and exports have gradually decreased. It is reported that the price in the north is lower than that in Shanghai, and because warehouses are full, brokers from Shantou and Guangdong have been actively purchasing in recent days. Two ships, the Haili and Guangzhou, transported about 18,000 bags of rice and beans to Guangdong the day before yesterday. Three ships, the Haiyuan, Dali South, and Guangdong, that are exporting today are transporting 17,000 bags of flour and 16,000 bags of rice and beans to Shantou, and 11,500 bags of flour and 21,400 bags of rice and beans to Guangdong.

### Yarn and Cotton

Recent Yarn Prices Diverge from Three-Star Goods, Three-Star Goods Plunge 12-13 Yuan, Golden Rooster February Contract Alone Rises by 1 Yuan, Near-Term Rises While Far-Term Falls, Again Showing Inverted Structure

The yarn market rose ten times in the morning, but the recent market trend has been unusually firm. It is rumored that a consortium of bull companies is organized, buying up the February contract, preparing to take delivery of the goods. It is also said that an Indian merchant, Qiao Zhifu, has bought a large amount. It is found that a certain company has bought a huge amount of the February contract alone and has also hedged a lot of the March and April contracts. Therefore, although the three-star yarn market has repeatedly declined, the near-term contract has not been affected, while the far-term contract has become weak. Trading in the current yarn market is unusually sluggish. Three-star yarn has fallen sharply compared to the previous day, by 8.20 to 13.40 yuan.

Large Buyers in the February Contract

At the opening of the trading in standard yarn on the former day, each month showed a decline. Because the three-star yarn, which had been soaring continuously, had reacted and was continuously declining, dealers tended to sell. However, the market was not significantly affected, and prices tended to rise. The trading floor was still tight. This was actually because two firms, Mian Chang and Geng Feng, were absorbing large amounts in the February contract and releasing the March and April contracts. It is rumored that the purchase has already reached 12,000 bags, but the amount hedged in the far-term contract is also large. Trading in current yarn remains sluggish. The result of the trading in standard yarn was a rise of 1.46 yuan in the near-term contract and a rise or fall of 1.3 yuan in the far-term contract. At the afternoon opening, the decline in three-star yarn gradually restrained the people's sentiments. At the same time, the trading of current yarn declined, and floating longs liquidated, resulting in the market being suppressed again. The result was that each month's closing price fell by 5, 7, 8 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. The following are the firms that sold out: Hengyi 600 bags, Jinchang 1,350 bags, Taixing 1,150 bags, Gengfeng 2,200 bags, Senkang 1,050 bags, Renfeng 800 bags, Changfeng 3,300 bags, Hexing 1,000 bags, Yongda 500 bags, and Tonghe 500 bags. The following are the firms that bought in: Yudai 950 bags, Mingde 700 bags, Shenji 900 bags, Dachangcheng 3,300 bags, Runkang 1,150 bags, Xiecheng 800 bags, Xincheng 500 bags, Changji 650 bags, Xingchang 650 bags, Juxing 400 bags, and Yichang 400 bags. The highest and lowest prices for each month during the day are listed on the left.

Thread Prices Rise Alone by One Yuan

The trading of current yarn is mediocre. The total number of bags purchased by various groups throughout the day was 576, and the selling price was flat. Thread prices rose by 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of various groups are listed below.

Cotton Prices Do Not Fluctuate Greatly, and Market Trading Is Also Quiet

The cotton market has not been prosperous or damaged and still does not escape the consolidation situation. The situation is tired and sluggish. In addition, the overseas Indian and American cotton markets are also hovering, and the people's hearts are even more uninterested. However, the ratio of yarn to cotton is too far apart, and some try to tighten it, and they do not give up.

Standard Cotton Only Falls by One Jiao

The trend at the opening of trading of standard cotton on the former day was unusually flat. The market overseas showed no sign of vitality, and market trading became increasingly sparse. Therefore, there was absolutely no excitement. However, some people were optimistic because the prices in various producing areas were difficult to loosen. The result was that each month's closing price rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, prices of far-term three-star cotton plummeted, and the market was hit again. Near-term prices broke the 4 yuan to 5 yuan mark. However, trading in the trading floor was very quiet, with little fluctuation. The result was that each month's closing price fell by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half compared to the morning closing price. The following are the firms that sold out: Changfeng 3,000 dan, Zhenda 800 dan, Tongji 900 dan, Dachangcheng 1,200 dan, Taichang 1,600 dan, Tonghe 900 dan, Xinchang 1,200 dan, Ruiyuan 1,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 800 dan, and Taixing 1,600 dan. The following are the firms that bought in: Jifeng 1,100 dan, Hengyi 2,600 dan, Yudai 3,000 dan, Zhenda 800 dan, Hexing 900 dan, Yichang 1,300 dan, Changhe 1,700 dan, and Wangtaixing 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices for each month during the day are listed on the left.

Cotton Mills Constantly Need Current Cotton

Consumption of current cotton is still considered high, and cotton mills constantly need it. The supply that arrived includes 2,018 bales of Yao cotton and 1,360 bales of Tong cotton.

American Cotton Is Still Under the Fear of the Government Selling Off Stored Cotton

Yesterday, American cotton opened, with each month falling 4 points or rising 2 points. At the beginning of the morning, foreign firms bought in, and news from Liverpool was good, and domestic consumption increased. Unfortunately, floating longs liquidated, especially in March. At the same time, longs in the March contract also rolled over to the far-term contract. The cotton market under the month is still under the force of panic caused by the government's sale of stored cotton. There are very few new purchases. Although peers are good buyers, their demand for the March contract is not as eager as before. One delivery notice for the January contract was issued, and the closing was firm. It is estimated that spot prices fell 5 points, and futures fell 5 points to rise 2 points. English cotton spot prices fell 1 point, and futures rose 12 points. Indian cotton speculators sold out and longs liquidated, but local factories absorbed large quantities because cloth was firm and expensive. It is estimated that Pinguoer fell 0.25 to 0.75 rupees, Aomula fell 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bairuoxi fell 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 14th).

According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 15th is: Bairuoxi 229.5 rupees, Aomula 206.5 rupees, both down 0.75 rupees, and Pinguoer 183.75 rupees, down 0.5 rupees.

Attached is the weekend statistical report on American cotton as follows (in thousands):

Bond Market Still Lacks Vigorous Atmosphere

Yesterday, the trend in the government bond market remained sluggish. Price fluctuations were minimal. Due to the chaotic situation, investor confidence continued to waver. The forces of buyers and sellers remained locked in a stalemate. Retail investors were mostly day traders, buying and selling in equal measure, which stabilized the market. Although there was a sense of underlying potential for upward movement, a truly vigorous atmosphere was still lacking. Yesterday morning, the opening atmosphere was relatively firm and trading was somewhat active. Issues like 327, 38, and 6 all saw some day trading. Issues 43 and 35 saw considerable buying. Market prices rose by 1-2 cents. Category A bonds for the current month rose slightly by one cent. In the second session, buying and selling activity remained strong, and the upward trend continued. Issue 43 continued to see strong buying, while issues 77 and 44 saw significant selling. Category A bonds for the next month rose by about another cent.

United States to Collect Sugar Processing Tax

Secretary of Agriculture Plans to Levy One Cent Per Pound

Reuters, New York, 14th – Secretary of Agriculture Wallace plans to levy a sugar processing tax of one cent per pound, which would increase national tax revenue by $125 million. He stated that if Congress does not pass his proposed quota plan, it will be destroyed, resulting in chaos for the sugar refining industries in the United States, Cuba, and American colonies. Some believe that this action by the Secretary of Agriculture is a precursor to levying processing taxes on all agricultural products, which were already included in the original Agricultural Adjustment Act. Many believe that levying a processing tax will be deemed constitutional.

Also, from London: Sugar prices are very tight in the near term due to short covering. The March contract opened at 6 shillings and 6 pence, up 3 pence. May was at 6 shillings and 4.5 pence, up 1 pence and 7.5. August was at 6 shillings and 4.75 pence, up 1 pence.

### Metals

Tinplate Prices Rise in China and Abroad

The annual sales of tinplate reach 200,000 boxes. Local factories use more, while foreign businesses use less. The largest source is the United States, followed by Italy, Germany, France, and England. The quality of materials is best from the United States, and worst from England and France. Currently, the most prevalent on the market are American and Italian products, followed by German and English products. French products have already disappeared from the market. The market conditions for each product are described below:

(American Products) The most recently circulating products on the market include 90-pound single-sheet (14 inches by 20 inches), double-sheet (20 inches by 28 inches), and 100-pound single-sheet and double-sheet. Transactions are few due to the extremely high prices, but prices are skyrocketing. For example, 90-pound double-sheet is priced at 10 gold yuan, and 100-pound is priced at 11 gold yuan and 10 cents (single-sheet prices are half). It is reported that fellow traders have made forward purchases of 4,000 boxes, while our street only sold a little over 100 boxes yesterday.

(Italian Products) The quality of this product is good, so actual transactions are very active. The only circulating product on the market is 180-pound, priced at 41 yuan, up one yuan from before. The overseas price is currently 42 shillings (90-pound double-sheet), while 100-pound double-sheet is priced at 43 shillings. It is reported that fellow traders have purchased over 4,000 boxes, reportedly purchased by metal shops along North Suzhou Road and Xin Kai River.

(German Products) The only circulating product on the market is also 90-pound double-sheet. There are only a few 100-pound double-sheets in stock, so there is no large market. The price of 90-pound double-sheet is 40 yuan and 5 cents, and 100-pound is 43 yuan. It is reported that transactions are slightly slower than Italian products, and the prices are similar to Italian products. Very few fellow traders have purchased them.

(English Products) In the past four or five years, this product dominated the tinplate market. Later, due to the lower quality, it was eliminated by Italian and German products. The amount of arrivals has also decreased. The only circulating products on the market are 90-pound and 100-pound single-sheet. Double-sheet has not been in stock for a long time. The price of 90-pound is 10 yuan and 5 cents, and 100-pound is 22 yuan. It is reported that foreign businesses still have some business, but our street has not heard of any sales. The overseas price is 20 shillings for 90-pound and 21 shillings for 100-pound, also up one shilling from before.

### Silk and Tea

Japanese and American Silk Prices Drop Suddenly, Shanghai Silk Trading Slightly Sluggish

Yesterday, overseas silk markets showed mixed trends. Silk merchants' asking prices continued to rise, while exchange sales showed a reactionary situation. The New York Stock Exchange's standard silk for the near term fell by a significant 8.5 points yesterday, and the long term also fell by 6.5 points. In the Yokohama silk market, spot prices fell by 35 yuan, and forward prices fell by 21 yuan. However, the holding price of Japanese silk 83 degrees in New York rose by 2 points compared to the previous day, and 75 degrees rose by 3 points. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk each rose by 4 points. In the Lyon silk market, except for Japanese silk, which fell by 0.25 francs, the prices of other silks remained the same as the previous market. Yesterday, the local silk market in Shanghai was influenced by the sudden drop in Japanese and American silk prices, so only high-grade white filature silk saw some trading. Sales of B-grade silk were slightly hindered, but investor sentiment remained optimistic. Printed Douppion silk and Sichuan factory silk continued to be sold. User silk market also remained firmly stable. 137 bales were sold yesterday.

### Statistics

Shanghai Price Index Reaches Highest Level Since 1932 in December 1936

According to the report of the National Tariff Commission, the wholesale, export, and import price indices and the Shanghai cost of living index all rose sharply in December 1936 compared to the previous month. The monthly percentage changes in the annual indices, except for the initial implementation of the legal tender in November 1935, when the value of the currency decreased and various indices once rose sharply by 5% to 15%, usually changed by no more than 3%. This month, the export index rose sharply by 6%, and the wholesale index also rose by more than 5%, a very strong increase. Moreover, the beginning of this upward trend was already seen last month, and it continued to increase this month, so the index reached its highest level since 1932. In terms of classified indices, except for a slight drop in wholesale chemicals and stable rent and miscellaneous expenses in the cost of living, all other categories increased, indicating the universality of this price increase. In terms of individual items, the price increases of major items such as metals, coal, oil, cake, cotton yarn, wheat, flour, cotton cloth, and miscellaneous grains were particularly large. Comparing the 15th of this month with the same day last month, metals rose by 2% to 33%, coal by 11% to 30%, oil and cake by 6% to 21%, cotton yarn by 8% to 20%, wheat by 13% to 18%, flour by 16%, cotton cloth by 5% to 14%, and miscellaneous grains by 2% to 12%. This is why the wholesale indices for metals, grains, fuel, and textiles rose sharply by 4.9% to 9.8%, the export and import indices for agricultural and mineral products, raw materials, and manufactured goods rose by 4.1% to 12.6%, and the cost of living indices for clothing and food rose by 3.1% to 6.0%. As for the reasons for this surge in prices, they are extremely complex. One possible explanation is that the overseas market prices of international commodities such as wheat and metals rose sharply. Secondly, due to years of economic recession, production has decreased, and there are few inventories. This year's agricultural harvest was abundant, and the purchasing power of people in the interior has slightly recovered. The market for daily necessities has become more active, and supply cannot meet demand. Thirdly, the Xi'an Incident on the 12th of this month was fortunately resolved quickly. At the time, people were quite nervous, and the futures trading of miscellaneous rice, yarn, and cloth showed a tendency to jump and rise sharply, which raised spot prices.

㊀ The general index of wholesale prices was 118.8, an increase of 5.1% compared to the previous month and 15.0% compared to the same month last year, the highest level since February 1932. Comparing the various indices with the previous month, except for a slight drop in chemicals, all other categories rose sharply, especially metals, grains, fuel, and textiles. The remaining three categories also increased significantly. The metal index rose by 9.8%. Due to rising external market prices, strong domestic sales, and a perceived shortage of spot goods, most prices rose sharply, especially steel, with ship steel plates rising by as much as 29% to 33%. The grain index rose by 9.1%. Among the 22 items in this category, the prices of about 20 items rose sharply, such as wheat, which rose by 15% due to sharp overseas increases, and flour, which rose by 15% due to strong sales in North China. According to a Chicago telegram on December 15, the futures market price for wheat at 60 pounds per bushel this month was US$1.33, an increase of 14.7% compared to US$1.16 on the same day last month, which is the same trend as in Shanghai. Other items such as beans, sorghum, and corn rose by 3% to 11%. Although the autumn harvest of white rice was abundant in various places and the arrival of Ke Xian rice in Shanghai was strong, prices still rose by 2% to 7%, except for a slight drop in Xiang rice. The fuel index rose by 8.6%. The original value of white coal and bituminous coal was to sell them, but the sources were sharply reduced due to the Sui War, the Shaanxi Incident, and the shallow Yangtze River and the freezing of Yingkou. Market prices rose sharply by 11% to 30%. Firewood and charcoal also rose in tandem. The textile index rose by 4.9%. The largest price increases were for cotton yarn and cotton cloth, mainly due to strong sales and a shortage of spot goods. For example, the price of 16-count Baoding cotton yarn this month was 360 yuan per bale, a new high since records began in 1919, an increase of 100 yuan compared to 166 yuan in July 1935. The increase in cotton was smaller, probably due to this year's abundant harvest. The divergence between yarn and cotton prices is becoming more pronounced. Ji Man Douppion silk is in short supply and printing sales are strong, and prices have also risen. However, the prices of one-quarter of the items in this category remained stable, otherwise the increase in the index would have been even greater. (To be continued)

Women's Special

### Prospects for Family Education

— Yafei

Family education is the foundation of all children's education. Social education and school education can only be effectively connected after the initial stage of family education. Some say that the family is the bedrock of society, and the foundation of society is formed by its individual families. Women are the central figures in the family. If we compare the family to a school, then women are the faculty, and the children are the students.

If we study child psychology, we can understand that the period before a child reaches school age – before the age of six – is the most important learning period. Every child is born without inherent intelligence, only a pure desire for knowledge. During this period, children have the greatest capacity for learning and imitation. This is evident in the way children under two or three years old can learn to speak common languages. Therefore, children in this period are most likely to learn various habits and fundamental concepts.

During the pre-school years, children have no opportunity to experience school education, let alone social education. Thus, this is an important period when the family bears sole responsibility for education. Family education is the starting point for all life training. The development of physique, mood, behavior, morality, intelligence, and habits all depend on good family education. Even when children reach school age and education is the responsibility of the school, they still spend much of their time at home. For example, daily routines like eating, sleeping, and living all take place within the family. Even after a child starts school, the importance of family education remains. School education is inherently mechanical and cannot be as vibrant or deeply experiential as family education.

Last year, I visited many charitable children's organizations and orphanages. I was very impressed with them. Although they were groups or institutions, they placed great emphasis on family education in addition to school education. In terms of etiquette, personality, behavior, habits, labor, and thought guidance, as well as physical health and intellectual knowledge, they were much better than in ordinary families. This is because their teachers and nannies are knowledgeable, dedicated, and neither overindulgent nor abusive like some mothers. They reward good children and give disciplinary measures to those who are mischievous, turning neglected, homeless children into hardworking and dedicated kids. Inspired by this impression, I began to think about what it takes to meet the requirements of family education. First, we should have full cultivation of our own body and mind. Second, we must completely abandon the concept of patriarchal traditional habits. Third, children should develop good habits and character. Fourth, we should study the necessary knowledge and common sense of child education. Fifth, parents should be fair and correct to their children. Sixth, do not engage in obscene or superstitious behavior in front of children... In short, we cannot allow children to have bad impressions or acquire bad habits at any time or place.

"Once, Mencius' mother chose a neighborhood," because she was afraid that her child would be affected by the bad children in the neighborhood, so she had to choose a neighborhood to live in. Proximity to vermilion makes one red; proximity to ink makes one black. Children's temperaments are most easily assimilated.

### Women of the Future

— Zhu Xiuqing

The year 1937 has arrived. Everyone starts the first day with excitement and joy, but everyone (except for those who are numb) has a terrible shadow imprinted in their hearts. Everyone knows that the road to "revival" is not easy. There are many rugged paths and obstacles blocking us. Therefore, we have to put all our strength into fighting, fighting. Although the enemy is much stronger than us, if we rely on our enthusiasm and struggle hard, we will one day overcome the enemy. Since everyone has a dark shadow deeply imprinted in their hearts, I hope they will not feel cold, timid, or discouraged because of the shadow. They should strive to remove this shadow.

Women are naturally very busy today, but I hope that women will not forget the responsibility they should assume this year in the midst of their busy schedule. This responsibility has been neglected by women throughout history. In any case, please women take on this important responsibility from today!

Everyone understands that there is no child who cannot be taught well, but whether a child can be taught well is the greatest responsibility of women. A child is a blank sheet of white paper, and the mother is the artist holding the pen. The quality of the picture depends entirely on how the artist wields the pen. Therefore, women who are not concerned about their children are guilty as mothers. A nation is not sound if it lacks sound youth. And youth is not sound because of a lack of sound children. But children are unsound because of the fault of the mother. From this perspective, the nation's lack of revitalization is the fault of women. Moreover, China, with its frail body, has embarked on a dangerous road, and it goes without saying that it desperately needs strong young people. In other words, it also desperately needs strong children.

To cultivate strong children, we should proceed simultaneously in three aspects. First: Mothers must ensure that their children understand everyday knowledge, scientific knowledge, and the overall situation of the country. Second: Mothers must ensure that their children develop perseverance, endurance, fearlessness of hardship, and a willingness to sacrifice, as well as a spirit of great courage. Third: Chinese people are the sick men of East Asia: so the most important thing is to ensure that children have a healthy physique. Mothers should strive to make their children little bulls.

Time flies by quickly, and another year will slip away in an instant. Hurry! Women, please resolve today to take on this key responsibility for revitalizing the nation!

### Japanese Women and Face Powder

— Yifa

In the Chinese mainland, the Japanese women one sees have faces painted as white as Cao Cao’s. After going to Japan, one realizes that it has become a habit for Japanese women to use face powder. Women in their forties and fifties still have faces full of rouge and powder. The method Japanese women use to apply powder is also unique. Regardless of how cold the weather is, they strip to the waist, kneel in front of the mirror, and apply powder to their heart’s content. The white powder on their necks is piled so thick that even the lines of the skin are buried, forming a very obvious line with their faces. This method of makeup can be used to create an oval face. Kyoto is a place famous for its beauties, and none of the women there go without heavy makeup. Tokyo women have a tendency to wear Western clothes, so the way they use white powder has also changed. They mostly mix and apply it with various colors of rouge, but it is always more heavily and seductively made up than Chinese women.

Female students wear blue uniforms in middle school and do not apply powder. After entering higher women's schools, they begin to style their hair and put on makeup. In the morning, many women with faces full of powder and dressed in dazzling finery walk the streets. If they weren't carrying schoolbags, who would believe that they were going to school to study? In streetcars and quiet alleys, incidents often occur where fake gentlemen and delinquent youths harass female students. This cannot but be blamed on the fact that Japanese female students are too fond of dressing up.

In the past, Japanese white powder contained lead. Actors and geishas who applied too much powder often suffered from lead poisoning and died. In 1929, the government ordered a ban on the sale of white powder containing lead. However, white powder without lead was not only less effective but also easily came off. Finally, the brands Misono and Butterfly Garden released new types of white powder, which stopped the import of foreign goods. Now, it is gradually being improved, and although it is called white powder, it is divided into seven or eight colors. Women can choose to match their clothes, the season, and their individual personalities. Although Chinese women do not consume as much white powder as Japanese women, they spend more on other perfumes and cosmetics. Moreover, the decorations used by Japanese women are all domestic products. They can not only supply their own women but also export them to China. Chinese women, however, reject domestic cosmetics and are proud to buy foreign goods. This is fundamentally different from Japanese women and is very shameful.

The department stores that sell cosmetics are full of young and beautiful female employees. They use the best quality rouge and powder and act as makeup models. They sometimes persuade customers to try various makeup methods in order to promote their white powder. In the past, actresses and geishas were used for advertising. Nowadays, times are different, and a large price is paid to invite movie stars and dance stars to write a letter of praise as an advertisement, which is the same situation as in China. In the early days of the Meiji Restoration, women from good families mostly did not use makeup. White powder could be said to be exclusively used by actresses and geishas, but it is now so universally popular. In recent years, Japanese people have become wealthy, and both men and women are influenced by European culture, and they admire extravagance. Although makeup methods are gradually changing, white powder is always loved by Japanese women.

### Heroines of the Spanish War (Part 1)

— Bo Ken

Who says women are not fit for the battlefield! Throughout the war history of ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, we have indeed seen many heroic deeds of women joining the military. Even in the recent records of the Spanish Civil War, we have discovered four new-style female warriors, which is enough to prove that the ability of modern women to contribute to war is no less than that of men.

Among the modern Spanish female warriors, Ms. La Pasionaria stands out for her bravery. La Pasionaria is a nickname; her real name is Dolores Ibaruri. She is the wife of a miner and used to be a laundress. Two years ago, a rebellion broke out in northern Spain, with the main participants being the miners of Oviedo. They initiated a revolution and organized local Soviets, but eventually collapsed because they could not withstand the repression of the government forces (at that time, the Spanish government bought and hired a large number of Moorish mercenaries known for their bravery). It was in that battle that Ms. Dolores began to show her skills as a female warrior and was nicknamed La Pasionaria.

Everyone who lives in Oviedo is familiar with Ms. Dolores' first battle experience. At that time, a group of miners who were enthusiastic about Bolshevism and participated in the war were suffering from poor weapons. What they carried with them were old, dilapidated short guns or repeating pistols. They felt that these useless weapons posed more danger to them than the arrival of government troops. Soon, they discovered that the tools they used daily in the dark mine layers—dynamite sticks—were indeed the most suitable military weapons. Thus, dynamite sticks became their hand grenades.

At that time, government troops were deployed on the streets and squares of Oviedo. Here or there, an inconspicuous adult woman wearing an old, dirty linen shawl walked over, took a small thing out from under the folds of her skirt, and threw it forcefully at the soldiers. In this way, she killed many soldiers of the government army. This woman was Ms. Dolores, who was known as La Pasionaria.

In terms of appearance, "La Pasionaria" is really a most inappropriate nickname. Ms. Dolores Ibaruri is neither young nor as delicate as a flower. She is already fifty-seven years old this year, and her face has become old and haggard due to her long experience of hardship. Compared with the countless working women who run around the streets of Spain every day, Ms. Dolores really does not have any special appearance.

Her husband was a member of the Soviet government established by the miners. He was killed in battle, and she was arrested and imprisoned. Months later, she was pardoned and released from prison and was elected as a Communist member of Congress.

Recently, after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Ms. Dolores once again had the opportunity to participate in the war. This time, she was on the side of the government forces. She led the wives and children of the miners of Oviedo to form a women's suicide squad—this was a pioneering initiative in Spain.

Ms. Victoria Kent is another typical Spanish female warrior. She is an outstanding member of Spanish women. She is not a communist, but a reformist Republican. She believes in reform, but does not approve of reforms that overthrow the current order. She was born in Spain, her father is English, and her mother is Spanish; she studied in England and France. She was one of the earliest leaders of the women's suffrage movement in Spain and was dragged out of the gate of King Alfonso's palace by guards. Soon, the imperial system collapsed, Alfonso was expelled, and the Republican government was established. The women's suffrage demanded by Ms. Victoria and others was thus laid the foundation. Ms. Victoria was elected as a member of Congress and appointed as a prison commissioner.

### What should you talk to your children about when they come home from school?

— Yang Daizhongxin

It must be very happy when you stand at the door and see your children coming back with their schoolbags and laughing and joking. When they reach your arms, you will definitely ask them all sorts of questions, such as whether they were reprimanded by the teacher today? Have they been bullied? Did they fall during physical exercise? Are they hungry? Sometimes you may ask if they understand arithmetic today, etc. All of these fully express your loving heart and reveal your inner joy! However, these many questions have very little educational value. If they are unfortunate enough to grasp and take advantage of your doting shortcomings, it may be harmful.

We should know that education is life, and school is a place to transform life. Your children are constantly transforming their lives and experiences in school, and they always improve their lives a little every day. The first thing a mother should know is whether her child has gained new life and new experiences on this day! Therefore, for young children, you can ask: Have you played any new games today? How do you play them? What are the interesting stories? Can you tell them? As for older children, you can ask them to report on some situations such as meetings, sports, and self-government work. Secondly, you can ask about the situation of learning various subjects and the news in the society, because these are directly or indirectly related to children's lives.

At the same time, we should also know that school and family should be absolutely connected so that the educational effect can be increased. Therefore, the second thing we should ask our children is: Does the teacher have anything to tell us? In this way, he will not forget what the teacher is eager to ask parents to cooperate on.

Again, we want to ask him what homework he has today? Or other preparatory work assigned by the teacher? Then you give him a working time to guide him to work on time, so as to avoid psychological pain caused by not being able to do it or forgetting it. Only in this way can you truly express your true love!

Finally, as a mother, you should know your children's social life. They have started their social period since they were four years old. This social life has a great impact on them. You should ask them in detail about the life they and their good friends have lived? Have they made new companions? Do you want to visit him after school? At the same time, you should always guide him to make excellent friends, avoid abnormal work, and keep him in a beautiful environment forever.

### Long-Term Vision

### Female Porters of Guangzhou

— Xi

Guangzhou, its commercial development is prosperous. Everything is the same as other major commercial ports. It is an important commercial port that occupies the third position in China, but there are thousands of female porters there. When getting off from the transportation port or station in Guangzhou. You can always see them: some young and strong women, wearing short jackets of blue cloth or Xiangyun gauze, barefoot, like male coolies, are soliciting passengers to carry some heavy luggage for them, and maintain their own lives by obtaining some meager wine money.

In the past, Guangzhou did not have women working as porters. Its emergence cannot but be blamed on the warlords of that year, in the seventh and eighth years of the Republic of China. The warlords in Guangzhou would implement conscription whenever something happened. Most of those conscripted were selected for their strong physique. As a result, those coolies became suitable candidates in their eyes, so those coolies avoided coming out. Under this circumstance, female porters emerged in response to the situation.

Up to now, the number of female porters in Guangzhou is still increasing day by day, because general passengers believe that women are relatively more reliable. Entrusting luggage and other things to them to carry will not lead to the danger of being cheated or extorted, and the carrying price is one-third cheaper than that of male porters, so they are very much needed by a part of the people.

Some of the female porters are employed by some large warehouses. Their work is even more pitiful. In addition to carrying baskets of fruits or boxes of tea, they sometimes have to carry heavy iron parts and rice bags. The wages they earn are mostly calculated according to the number of pieces transported. Generally, each piece can be carried from the transportation port to the warehouse for about two cents, but their foreman still has to take away some.

Most of those female porters could not find work in factories, and they did not have looms in their own homes, nor did they have a place to work as maids. In order to survive instinctively, they were reduced to being porters at docks and stations. However, many of them already have children. Because their husbands cannot support them, they have no choice but to abandon their children and come out to exchange sweat for some money to survive.

As for their work, they have to work at least ten hours a day, but the wages they earn will not exceed eighty cents. Sometimes, regardless of winter or snowy days, if ships dock at the pier in the middle of the night, they have to get up to carry things.

Among the many working women, the female porters of Guangzhou should be considered the most hardworking.

### First Letter

— Zhuo Dai

Ms. B:

Today I received a letter from Mr. Zhou, which I have already read. Your criticism of me is very good. When the motherland is facing a great disaster, instead of studying some academics that can save the country and benefit the people, I am learning to build a garden, isn't it preparing for the enjoyment of the idle class? No wonder you specifically asked Mr. Zhou to forward a letter to me, saying that I should not be so confused and waste my limited time on unreasonable things. This may also be what people who know me in your place want to say to me?

But you should know that I am a very ordinary person. I have not succeeded in learning academics or swordsmanship, so I cannot even talk about studying academics that can save the country and benefit the people. I still plan to take my previous experience of growing vegetables for seven or eight years and go a step further to learn some gardening art. (Many people also think that I am learning horticulture, which is a complete misunderstanding.)

My original aspiration was only this. Unexpectedly, when I entered school and carefully studied the way of gardening, I discovered unexpected wonders contained in gardening academics. What is it? It is what you call saving the country and benefiting the people. Unexpectedly, gardening is also a weapon to save the country and benefit the people. After hearing this, won't you laugh at me for shouting gardening to save the country like dancing to save the country? I say this not as a joke, but completely based on facts. Now let me talk to you about the outline of gardening separately.

There are several kinds of gardening that I study. The largest is a natural park with an area of tens of miles, and the smallest is a bonsai placed in a rectangular tray, all within the scope of gardening.

Ordinary people only know that there are two kinds of gardens, one is a private garden, and the other is a park. In fact, the classification is not that simple. All public buildings, such as government offices, schools, hospitals, libraries, public assembly halls, etc., are decorated with flowers, trees, and rocks in the remaining land and roads, which also belong to gardening.

In addition, those scenic areas are designated by the government as so-called natural parks, and their arrangement and management are also the work of gardening. What I call saving the country and benefiting the people refers to this kind of natural park. Other things such as urban parks and private gardens are also related to saving the country and benefiting the people, but not as obvious as natural parks.

In recent years, various countries have often used their own scenic areas to be designated as national natural parks and have vigorously promoted them, so they have become famous scenic areas, so that tourists are like weaving. Therefore, this area can absorb countless money from the outside every year. This area has become a rich place. We only need to look at how much money West Lake can attract from the outside world in the spring and autumn seasons every year to understand this meaning.

However, the purpose of the so-called national natural parks in various countries is not only to attract domestic tourists, but also to make grand publicity to the outside world, such as the Niagara Falls in North America. The economic benefits obtained by attracting tourists there every year are 40 million, half of which are foreigners.

Being able to attract foreign money, I feel that it is indeed one of the biggest works of saving the country and benefiting the people in my China, which is now economically invaded by the great powers. Moreover, the expenses required to run a natural park are not much, and it is extremely suitable for the current situation in our country! I plan to start from natural parks and step into the first step of saving the country and benefiting the people in the future. I guess you also agree, right?

### A Page of Unspeakable Diary

— Qin Chen

A rather thick diary book, recording a year, the number of words is at least six or seven hundred thousand, but most of them are just sunny, rainy days, eating, getting sick, a few friends coming, spending a few dollars... all trivial things that are irrelevant, not to mention keeping secrets, even if it is left in the library, no one will want to read it: I feel too boring when I flip through it at the beginning of the new year, from beginning to end, it seems that only one page is the most exciting - these, this page was originally unspeakable at the beginning. But now it can go everywhere.

"...The sun was extraordinarily energetic in the afternoon, and every chair was sunburned, like it was suffering from chills and fever, burning hot to the touch, but my wife called twice from a friend's house, insisting that I go over for dinner after work. Helplessly, I braved the summer heat and got on the No. 5 tram. The No. 5 tram was crowded as usual. At ×× Road, a lady came up, and I had no choice but to stand up and give up my seat. Unexpectedly, before the lady sat down, another man's buttocks had already scrambled over. I shouldn't have been too enthusiastic for a moment and stopped him with my hand. As a result, the lady sat down, but my thin shoulder had already been hit with a heavy punch, and he even scolded me with many extremely obscene words. Of course, I wanted to resist, but many people next to me had already crowded up to persuade me to stop. My anger had nowhere to vent, and I got off the bus at the first stop in a fit of anger, walking under the sun with my head down without any awareness. At that time, it seemed that a pair of bright eyes were shooting onto my face, but I was too lazy to pay attention. After walking for a while, I suddenly discovered the lady who I had given up my seat to at the second stop. Before I had time to guess why she got off the bus here, she had already started apologizing to me, hoping that I would not be angry because of a scoundrel, and she even tried her best to invite me to go to an ice cream parlor for ice cream. Her attitude was very sincere, her words were full of sympathy, and her demeanor was strangely smart and moving, making me really reluctant to miss this rare opportunity; so we walked into the ice cream parlor together, exchanged surnames, and had a very speculative conversation for more than an hour. We talked about everything, except for my family. She also seemed to be very interested in listening, and from time to time she gave a strangely lovely knowing smile. In the end, I wrote my office address, phone number, and my full name on the crumpled paper I used to replace my handkerchief, and was about to hand it to her, hoping to reserve a chance to meet again; unexpectedly, her face suddenly underwent a strange and inexplicable change. She hurriedly crumpled the paper into a ball, stuffed it into her purse, got up and snatched the bill, and said that she had other important matters to attend to, and left in a rickshaw in a hurry.

When I found my wife's friend's house, they couldn't help but question me why I was getting off work so late; it was not difficult to tell a lie, so I lightly concealed it. Later, I suddenly found a small photo on the wall. This small photo really gave me a big shock. It turned out to be a group photo of my wife, her friend, and another lady, and this other lady was the one who had just parted ways with me in the ice cream parlor. I hurriedly asked my wife: "Who is this?"

"Eh! Don't you know? She's Hui Xin's (wife's friend) younger sister! Look how pretty she is!" My wife said proudly. I really didn't know how to answer her."

### The Xi'an Incident and Telecommunications

— Lü Bing

The Xi'an Incident has gradually been settled, and Commander-in-Chief Chiang has also safely escaped danger. But after the pain has subsided, recalling the situation at that time, at first the people were panicked and dangerous situations arose one after another, and later the people were encouraged and rejoiced. The changes in all these situations depended on the mutual transmission of news, and the telecommunications, from being blocked to being restored, also ended with this incident.

During the period when Commander-in-Chief Chiang was in distress, Xi'an's telecommunications first reported that they were not working. As a result, the people cried out, ran around to inquire, and went to various newspaper bureaus every day to inquire about the opening and closing of the lines. There was an endless stream of people, and telegrams of assistance and rescue from various places also came in one after another, almost without interruption. Others who asked about the situation in Xi'an on the phone were everywhere. When he escaped danger on the 25th of last month, within a few minutes, the long-distance telephone from Beijing to Shaanxi reported to Beijing. In an instant, the news spread everywhere. For a time, the whole country rejoiced, and everyone applauded. On the streets and alleys, only the sound of firecrackers was heard, and a new atmosphere was changed. The enthusiasm of the Chinese people in supporting the leader was fully demonstrated in this Xi'an Incident.

When the circuit is blocked and telecommunications are unavailable, the people's emotions are panicked and unsettled, as if a great disaster is approaching. When the line is restored and telecommunications are normal, the people's emotions turn optimistic, like the opening of wind and clouds. The line is the nerve of the whole country, issuing orders and conveying will, all of which depend on the interconnection of nerves. Since Commander-in-Chief Chiang was in distress, the nerves were abnormal. When the people felt the abnormality of the nerves, they showed a sad face in a hurry. When Commander-in-Chief Chiang escaped danger, the nerves were completely restored. When the people felt the restoration of the nerves, they had a happy look. The safety of the country depends on whether the nerves are healthy or not. We support the leader, love the country, and at the same time pay attention to the safety of the nerves.

In recent years, the telecommunications traffic in our country has made remarkable and rapid progress. The details of the Xi'an Incident relied on the transmission of reports and telephones, which was exceptionally fast. The lines that were destroyed were also repaired very quickly, so that major conveniences in communication could be obtained in a very short time. It is known that developing telecommunications is of great importance to the national interest and the people's livelihood. Since telecommunications are the nervous system of the whole country, maintaining the health of the nerves is our duty. Increasing construction to achieve its full development depends on the supervision and promotion of the whole country from top to bottom.

### The State of Telecommunications Administration in the Last Half Year

— Huang Xiuqing

This article is the transcript of a speech given by Mr. Huang Xiuqing, Section Chief of the Ministry of Communications, at the Central Broadcasting Station on January 13, 1937. It thoroughly elucidates the state of telecommunications administration in the second half of 1936. The editor specifically requested Mr. Huang to provide this transcript for publication in our journal to inform our readers. – The Editor

The Ministry of Communications received a letter from the Broadcasting Affairs Administration, stipulating that the broadcast dates for reports on the administrative situation of various agencies from January to June 1937. Today is the scheduled date for the report from the Directorate General of Telecommunications. The Directorate General of Telecommunications has dispatched me to present the report, titled "The State of Telecommunications Administration in the Last Half Year."

Regarding the telecommunications administration of the past year, the comprehensive article "One Year of Communications Administration" by Acting Minister Yu and Vice Minister Peng has clearly explained it. This article has been published in major newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, and I believe everyone has already read it. What I will be discussing now is merely a more detailed explanation of the state of telecommunications administration from July to December of last year. For the sake of clarity, I will divide it into five areas: telecommunications management, engineering, operations, personnel, and finance.

A. Telecommunications Management

According to the Telecommunications Regulations, telecommunications in our country should be uniformly managed by the Ministry of Communications. In special circumstances, with the approval of the Ministry of Communications, local governments, public or private organizations, or individuals may also establish telecommunications services. However, in reality, in addition to the above two situations, there are also many telecommunications businesses established in various places without the approval of the Ministry of Communications. In order to exercise its authority, the Ministry of Communications should supervise them. The telecommunications management work in the past half year has mainly focused on this. The following are some of the important measures taken: 1. Adjusting the long-distance telephone services of various provinces; 2. Regulating broadcasting programs; 3. Supervising privately-operated local telephone services; 4. Regulating private radio stations established by public organizations and societies; 5. Unifying the authority to approve the installation of dedicated telephone lines, etc. As for the telecommunications bureaus directly managed by the Ministry, those added in the past half year include 40 wired telegraph bureaus (including business offices and agency offices), one wireless radio station, and 28 long-distance telephone offices, all with the aim of facilitating communication and developing business.

B. Telecommunications Engineering

Since the telecommunications industry in our country needs to be expanded, engineering is of paramount importance in all undertakings. Since 1932, in terms of line expansion, the annual rate has been around 10,000 kilometers. Among these, the expansion of long-distance telephone lines has been particularly rapid. The telecommunications engineering work in the past half year has continued the work of the past and paved the way for the future. The following is a report on the implementation:

(1) Wired Telegraph Lines: 1,235 kilometers of new lines were installed, 2,265 kilometers of lines were repaired, and 2,754 kilometers of lines were added.

(2) Wired Telegraph Equipment: (1) For the Hankou long-distance duplex line, a Creed receiving perforator was installed at the Hankou Bureau; (2) For the Shanghai-Hankou duplex line, a vibrator was installed at each of the Shanghai, Suzhou, Xunwu, and Wuhan bureaus; (3) Wei-style single-current booster motors were installed at the Huaining, Bijie, Shantou, Ganxian, and Jiangshan bureaus; (4) A storage battery was installed in Zhengxian; (5) A Morse machine was installed in Shangrao and Badong respectively; (6) The three circuits from Hankou to Shashi, Xinyang, and Laohekou were all upgraded with a Morse duplex machine; (7) Eighty audio machines were upgraded in the Jiangsu and Shandong regions and neighboring bureaus.

(3) Wireless Telegraph Equipment: (1) An automatic transmitter was installed in each of the Beijing, Hankou, Tianjin-Shanghai, and Gan bureaus; (2) A 2,000-watt machine was installed in Shanghai; (3) A 250-watt machine was installed in Xiamen; (4) A 500-watt machine was installed in Nanjing, Chang'an, and Lanzhou respectively.

(4) Long-Distance Telephone Routes: 5,077 kilometers of lines were installed. Amplification stations have been completed in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Yinjiahui, and Jiujiang. Those being installed or about to be installed include Nanchang, Tongshan, Zhengxian, Baxian, Chang'an, Changsha, Yuanling, and Jiangshan.

(5) Domestic Wireless Telephone: The Shanghai machine is installed at the Zhenru Liuhang International Radio Station, the Hankou machine uses the Luojiadun station in Hankou as the transmitting station, and the Wuchang long-wave station as the receiving station. The Guangzhou machine has its transmitting station in Dongshipai Township and its receiving station in Hebian Village. All of these were fully operational in the second half of 1936.

(6) The engineering equipment of the Chengdu Broadcasting Station has been completed and officially began broadcasting in November of last year.

C. Telecommunications Operations

Regarding telecommunications operations, there have been many improvements in the past half year. To list them all would take too much time. The general principles are "facilitating communication," "increasing efficiency," and "expanding business." These three points have a consistent and interconnected nature. For example, to facilitate communication, it is necessary to increase efficiency. If efficiency can be increased, business can be expanded. Conversely, if efficiency cannot be increased, communication cannot be facilitated, and how can business be expanded? This is obvious. The following is a report on the telecommunications operations work in the past half year:

(1) Regarding facilitating communication: 1. Organizing ship radio stations; 2. Entrusting railway stations to receive and send telegrams; 3. Compiling Mongolian telegram codes; 4. Reducing domestic telegram rates; 5. Reducing international news telegram rates; 6. Improving social telegram methods; 7. Stipulating the method for returning telegram receipts; 8. Revising local telephone rates; 9. Abolishing long-distance telephone deposits; 10. Reducing rates for calling people, etc.

(2) Regarding increasing efficiency: 1. Converting wired telegraphs to perforators and printing machines; 2. Adding automatic transmitters and receivers to wireless telegraphs; 3. Streamlining wired and wireless telegraph services; 4. Streamlining telegram handling procedures; 5. Stipulating the method for using local telephones; 6. Improving long-distance telephone handling procedures, etc.

(3) Regarding expanding business: 1. Revising the Sino-French wireless telegraph agreement; 2. Proceeding with the revision of the Sino-German and the signing of the Sino-Soviet wireless telegraph agreements; 3. Proceeding with the signing of the Sino-American and Sino-British wireless telephone agreements; 4. Expanding the local telephone service area; 5. Promoting public telephones; 6. Revising the domestic long-distance telephone business regulations; 7. Opening long-distance wireless telephone services between Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Guangzhou, increasing the spatial distance of the communication range to about 1,200 kilometers; 8. Increasing the number of interconnected long-distance telephone locations by 445, increasing the line distance of the communication range from 560 kilometers to 1,152 kilometers.

The above are all improvements in telecommunications operations in the past half year. In addition, the reorganization of official and military telegram fees is also worth reporting. According to investigations, the number of words sent in official and military telegrams over the years accounts for more than 60% of the total number of words in telegrams, and the arrears amount to more than 3 million yuan, which has had a significant impact on the telecommunications economy. After Acting Minister Yu took over the affairs of the Ministry, he believed that the first step in increasing revenue for telecommunications was to reorganize the collection of official and military telegram fees. He then submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan, and from July 1, 1936, strictly ordered the implementation of a method for collecting and restricting official and military telegram fees. At the same time, he submitted a proposal to the Military Affairs Commission to re-define the bandit suppression areas and promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Military Emergency Secret Telegrams in Bandit Suppression Areas." Since its implementation, it has been very effective. Monthly income can be increased by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Most telegrams sent by various political and military agencies, except for a few, can now be paid in cash according to regulations. Unnecessary telegrams are now restricted, unlike the previous arbitrary sending.

D. Telecommunications Personnel

The important matters regarding telecommunications personnel in the past half year are as follows:

(1) Opening telegraph operator training classes: In recent years, the number of telegraph operators retiring, dying, and leaving their posts in various bureaus has been quite large. All vacancies need to be filled urgently. Therefore, the Ministry has advertised in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Nanchang, Guangzhou, Zhengxian, Jinan, Changsha, and Hangzhou to recruit 200 high school graduates. Training classes will be opened in the local telegraph bureaus to teach basic telecommunications knowledge and skills, with graduation scheduled after six months, in order to fill the vacancies.

(2) Approving the number of staff members in various bureaus: For more than ten years, the number of staff members in various bureaus has not been formally approved, resulting in inconsistencies in the number of personnel and uneven workload. In order to save expenses and increase work efficiency, the Ministry has dispatched personnel to various important bureaus to conduct on-site investigations, approve the number of staff members according to actual needs, and has successively announced the results. Personnel assignments will now have standards.

(3) Military training for telegraph and telephone operators: Telecommunications and transportation are of great importance to military affairs. Therefore, telegraph and telephone operators should have considerable military knowledge in order to perform their duties satisfactorily. In view of this, the Ministry has selected young telegraph and telephone operators from various bureaus to receive military training in batches, so that they have sound military knowledge and physique.

E. Telecommunications Finance

In the second half of 1936, the income from international telegrams was the most prosperous. Wired telegram fees increased by about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per month due to the reorganization of official and military telegram fees, as mentioned above. With the increase in the number of local telephone bureaus and the successive commissioning of long-distance telephone projects in nine provinces, the monthly income from local telephones has increased by more than 10,000 yuan since July, and the income from long-distance telephones within the nine-province plan has increased from more than 11,000 yuan to about 30,000 yuan. In summary, the total monthly cash income from telegram and telephone fees has gradually increased from more than 1.8 million yuan to more than 2 million yuan. On the expenditure side, the average monthly recurring expenses are about 1.5 million yuan. The revenue and expenditure are balanced with a surplus, but the burden of repaying debt principal and interest is too heavy, and the cost of various construction materials is very high, so the deficit is significant. In the past half year, new debts have been raised to maintain operations. In the future, with the development of business and the reduction of debt, the telecommunications economy will have the hope of prosperity.

The above are the major aspects of the state of telecommunications administration in the second half of 1936. Due to time constraints, I cannot describe them one by one. I apologize for that. In short, the telecommunications industry has now reached a period of "self-reliance," and all telecommunications personnel have a spirit of "striving for progress." In the future, as the country's politics become more stable and industry and commerce become more prosperous, there will be more people using telecommunications. Then, the telecommunications industry will surely prosper!

### Two New Measures for Domestic Long-Distance Telephone by the Ministry of Communications (Continued)

— Pu Zhan

New Year's New Contributions

2.  Calling a Person: If the caller or the designated receiver is out for some reason when the call is connected, and if the caller knows where the receiver is, or the receiver knows where the caller is, and the location also has a telephone within the same local telephone service area as the caller or receiver, the user can inform the telephone bureau of the telephone number at that location to have the call rerouted. If the caller or receiver is still not reached after the bureau reroutes the call, the fee should be paid according to regulations and the call terminated. If the caller is reached and the call goes through, only the call fee needs to be paid, and no additional fees will be charged for the rerouting procedure.

The wheel of time transforms human life from simple to complex, from narrow to broad. Similarly, the application of telephones has evolved from local to long-distance. In modern China, there are certainly many people who do not know how to use the telephone, but there are also many busy people who cannot do without long-distance telephone calls for a moment. In order to meet the needs of the times, the Ministry of Communications has been working hard to expand long-distance telephone lines. It also actively improves long-distance telephone services with the interests of users as the premise. Not to mention the past, even the recently stipulated measures that took effect on January 1, 1937, state that registered users who have paid the long-distance telephone deposit or have filled out the long-distance telephone connection application form may borrow the telephone of unregistered users to make long-distance telephone calls. Furthermore, if the caller or receiver of a person-to-person call is out, the calling or receiving user may request the telephone bureau to reroute the long-distance call to the telephone at the location of the caller or receiver to complete the call. Although the scope of these measures is limited to within the same local telephone service area, they are already extremely thoughtful for the convenience of callers and receivers using long-distance telephones.

Talking Points

### "Asceticism" and "Murderous Intent"

— Qun

The newspapers of the 14th had such a news item:

"Wang Baolu, a native of Yangzhou, is 58 years old and has been a pastor in a certain church in this city. He has no wife and is friendly with Qin Liantao, a local. Qin is 26 years old and also unmarried. Therefore, he and Wang are very close. Every time he is free from work, he often goes to Wang's residence to linger. They are friends who have forgotten their age, and their friendship is very strong. Recently, Qin was introduced by relatives and friends to marry a certain woman on the first of this month. As a newlywed, he became estranged from Wang. Wang, although nearly sixty years old, has not diminished in his passion. Seeing Qin infatuated with his new love and forgetting his old friend, he could not help but feel jealous and turned his kind and amiable pastor's face into a murderous intent..."

Reading such news would make people puzzled: Since they are friends who have forgotten their age and have a strong friendship, why would the friend become jealous and develop murderous intent after getting married?

I don't understand. But I remember that long-term abstinence can cause mental disorders. It just so happens that the murderer is also a pastor, and he is 58 years old and still "has no wife." Therefore, I can't help but suspect that the reason for the sudden murderous intent is probably because his mental state has become abnormal.

I have a collection of miscellaneous essays by Mr. Lu Xun called "Grave." In the middle, there is an essay called "The Doctrine of Widows," which mentions the mental disorders of single people. Now I will copy a section below as an explanation of the "murderous intent." --

"As for those who live a single life out of necessity, whether male or female, they often inevitably undergo changes in their mental state, and most of them have stubborn, suspicious, and insidious characteristics. The clergymen of medieval Europe, the ladies-in-waiting of the Imperial Palace before the Meiji Restoration in Japan, and the eunuchs of past dynasties in China, their cold and ruthless nature far exceeded that of ordinary people. Other single people are the same. Since their lives are not in accordance with nature, their mental state also changes greatly. They feel that everything in the world is tasteless and that people are hateful. When they see some innocent and happy people, they feel hatred. Especially because of the suppression of sexual desire, they are sensitive and suspicious of other people's sexual matters; they are envious and therefore jealous. In fact, this is also inevitable; forced by society, they certainly cannot but pretend to be pure on the surface, but in their hearts, they cannot escape the pulling of instinct and unconsciously squirm with a sense of regret."

Using this passage to explain the reason for "developing murderous intent" should not be too wrong. Although this still needs to be confirmed by specialists. However, from our superficial perspective, we know that in people with abnormal psychology, the desire for exclusive possession of love, which is "absolutely becoming one's own," is particularly strong. There are many examples. "Infatuated with his new love and forgetting his old friend, therefore developing murderous intent" can also be considered an example.

To divert the question, one would naturally have to ask why celibacy is formed. The answer is actually already available above. For example, the eunuchs of past dynasties in China were mostly formed "by being forced by society." However, "on the surface, they certainly cannot but pretend to be pure, but in their hearts, they cannot escape the pulling of instinct and unconsciously squirm with a sense of regret." Thus, tragedy is achieved.

However, even though things are like this, in China's traditional concept, it has always advocated "six roots of purity." Especially when it comes to the word "sex," people will cover their faces and run away, as if encountering some kind of flood or beast.

Although even today, even monks who are bearing the sign of "six roots of purity" have secret mistresses, and some file lawsuits for property, the notion of "sex" as a flood or beast remains unchanged.

### The Punishment Room for the Canadian Quintuplet Sisters

— Te

The movie "The Country Doctor", starring the world-famous Dionne quintuplets, has been shown in this city. I think readers have not forgotten it. Now these five little sisters still live in a specially built, exquisite nursery, still managed by Dr. Dafoe, with three nurses, one teacher, and supervisory guidance. Their every word and deed, like the emperor in an autocratic era, have detailed records, like the daily life of the emperor. What if one of them commits a mistake? Dr. Dafoe does not advocate corporal punishment, so he has never used corporal punishment on the five little sisters. So he came up with a method: he would lock the child who made a mistake in a specially designated "quiet room" and not allow her to play with the other four sisters. In addition to being used for punishment, the "quiet room" is also used for children who have contracted infectious diseases to live in, separating them from the rest of the sisters.

According to Dr. Dafoe: "This is the only method of punishing children for bad behavior in the nursery. When the five children were young, we only forbade the child with bad behavior to play with the other four sisters to make her feel something. Now that the children are older, this method no longer works, so we have to lock the bad child in a separate 'quiet room'. The 'quiet room' is eight feet long and six feet wide, and it is very bright, with large glass windows to let in plenty of sunlight and air. It is the same as the other rooms in the nursery. The room is only furnished with a table, a chair, and a few picture books, and everything is very comfortable. But there are two things that must be paid special attention to: one is that there is nothing in the room that can cause the child to hurt herself, and the other is that the essential element of punishment is that she must be left alone in the room, separated from the rest of her sisters, to make her feel lonely, which will achieve the purpose of punishment." Dr. Dafoe also said: "I am very opposed to some parents locking children who have made mistakes in a dark room, a basement, or in a narrow and uncomfortable place. That is barbaric and cruel. This kind of punishment will have a very bad effect on the child's nervous system immediately or in the future. Our 'quiet room' is different from this. Children feel very comfortable staying inside, and there are also toys that the other sisters play with, but they just can't play with them together. We often explain to the children why the bad child is locked in the 'quiet room' and tell them that after being locked inside, they will only be released to play with the rest of their sisters when their temper has improved. Our punishment method is very effective, so there is no need to use other punishment methods."

Now let me briefly describe the nursery. When it was first built, the children were young, and a few rooms were enough. As the children gradually grew up, the house had to be expanded step by step. Inside, there are entertainment rooms, offices, bedrooms, bathrooms, dining rooms, and kitchens. The entertainment room has all kinds of toys suitable for age and season, and the office has many charts hanging on it. The physical development and intellectual progress of the five children can be seen at a glance by looking at the charts. The toiletries and bathtubs in the bathroom are all specially made for children. There is also a special entertainment room with a small piano, gramophone, and other musical instruments. Dancing, playing music, and telling stories are all done in this room. In total, the equipment in the whole house is worth more than 100,000 Chinese dollars. That money was earned by the five little sisters themselves, and they also have a lot of money deposited in the bank. The nursery looks very grand. The house is two stories. Upstairs, in addition to the bedrooms for the director and the housekeeper, the rest is used as a storage room, storing all kinds of toys and clothes that are not currently used. Many of them are gifts from visitors. The number of personnel regularly used and temporarily hired in the house is usually between ten and fifteen. New houses will have to be built later to hire new staff. Before the summer of this year, it is planned to build a long fence around the nursery to surround the house, and enclose several acres of woodland behind the house. Then, in addition to playing in the large sports field, the five little sisters will also be able to take walks and relax among the flowers and plants in the natural woodland and will not get lost. At that time, the nursery can become a small village, as if it were a paradise.

### In the Cold Wind

— Lei Feng Wei Ke

### Watching Executions

— Jie Ren

When I was little, I was bold enough to go watch executions all by myself. When I say 'all by myself,' it's not like I was the only one there; besides me, there were naturally many other strangers who also went to watch the commotion together. It's just that I was on my own. "Watching executions" meant watching people being killed, but people didn't directly say "killing"; instead, they all called it that, perhaps to make it less obvious. They put a cloak on the words, hiding the gruesome reality. In that place, there were often executions to watch. The execution ground wasn't that far from my home. Children love to run around and are even more interested in seeing anything new and unusual, so I often went to be a spectator at killings.

Speaking of killing can make one's heart jump with fear. What a terrible and horrifying thing it is! Adults usually absolutely forbid children from watching, often warning them, "Don't go watch executions! The souls of those executed will follow you, and you'll have nightmares!" But I was skeptical of these words, mostly not very afraid, so the warnings weren't very effective. When an execution was happening, I'd hide it from the adults and secretly follow a group of people who were going to see the spectacle.

Whenever there was an execution, it was indeed lively. In this place, usually as quiet as an ancient city, even a minor event could stir up ripples in the stagnant hearts of the people. The killing, of course, stirred them up even more. When an execution was happening, first the "da-da-dian" bugle would sound. Everyone, hearing this familiar sound, would come out of their houses, like soldiers hearing the assembly call, and stand by the roadside. At this time, you would see a small squad of soldiers carrying guns and ammunition, followed by the person going to be executed, and then a crowd following to watch the excitement, summoned by the bugle.

It was said that those going to be executed were all heinous murderers and arsonists. Because they were murderers and arsonists, they had to be executed. A killer being killed fits the old saying, "Treat others as they treat you." But they didn't look very fierce or scary; they were no different from ordinary people. The only difference was that they were going to be executed, while we were watching them be executed. So why did they do murder and arson in the first place? There was no chance to ask them. At this time, they were about to die; what else was there besides living or dying?

Those going to be executed had a narrow, long white cloth flag with a triangular tip stuck on their backs. On it were written in black characters, "Executed Thief XXX." Around the words were red circles, like a primary school student's writing practice sheet. Their hands were tied behind their backs, and they wore shackles on their feet. The iron rings of the shackles clanged against each other. They walked with difficulty, step by step towards death. But you could believe that they certainly didn't want to die, but wanted to live! But now they weren't allowed to live; they had to die.

On the way, some of them appeared calm and unconcerned, what is called "composed." Some even sang little tunes and said, "In twenty years, I'll be a good man again." Then the onlookers would click their tongues in praise, calling them "Truly fearless heroes!" Naturally, no one would think about their true feelings at this moment under these subconscious actions. Perhaps they were being attacked and possessed by intense terror, or perhaps they still thought about living in extreme confusion, but living was clearly hopeless.

When they arrived at the execution ground, at the sound of the gun, they would fall to the ground. After twitching for a while, they would stop moving. Just like that, a minute ago, they were a living person; a minute later, their precious and irreplaceable life was taken away. But no one felt any sorrow for this most tragic scene of life. Naturally, the onlookers were not related to them, and what was there to pity about people who were supposed to die? Everyone clapped enthusiastically, loudly cheering and shouting "Good!" However, it was said that this was to protect themselves, because this could scare away the vengeful spirits, so they wouldn't follow people.

If that's the case, then why watch? Wouldn't it be easier not to watch? But everyone didn't. Whenever there was an execution, they still wanted to watch, yet they were afraid of the vengeful spirits following them. It was truly ridiculous. But it was originally necessary for everyone to watch. It had its significance when people watched, to "deter others from following suit," to "kill one to warn a hundred." That's why they first sounded the bugle "da-da-dian," to tell people: Someone is going to be killed, everyone come and watch, see if you're afraid! It was used in this way.

On the one hand, people kill; on the other hand, people are killed; and on yet another hand, people are indifferent. Moreover, they even cheer on the sidelines. The world seems to be maintained like this. And they not only cheer, but also complain that executions aren't as good as beheadings. They vividly describe how, with a "whack" sound, the head rolls to the ground, and red blood immediately gushes out like a fountain. It's truly a sight to see! Then the older generation would talk about the execution of revolutionaries back in the day, and the younger generation would hate that they were born too late to see it, and envy those who had seen it. Thinking about letting this situation continue, what a terrible result there would be?

### A Perfect Horror Film "Midnight Song"

Please pay attention everyone. A horror film full of poetry is about to appear in China's film industry. This is "Midnight Song," produced by Xinhua Company at great cost of capital and time.

We are here to give you some advance reports: This "Midnight Song" is directed by Ma-Xu Weibang. Some say that Ma-Xu Weibang's plays are full of sadness, but in fact they have a more positive and upward meaning. "Midnight Song" depicts the story of a young man struggling under the encirclement of evil forces.

The story unfolds in a gloomy, empty theater, where, in the dead of night, a ghostly singing voice and a zombie-like figure with a hideous face appear. In order to achieve the full effect of the play, the background arrangement, the structure of the light, and the makeup of each character's face are all given a terrifying nature, creating a unique style.

In terms of actors, in addition to Hu Ping, Jin Shan, Gu Eryi, Shi Chao, Gu Menghu, and Wang Weiyi, who had great success in "Night of Carnival," Zhou Wenzhu, Xu Manli, Xiao Ying and other famous stars have joined. Due to proper distribution, everyone happily takes on the role they are responsible for.

### Grand Theater Screens "Foolish Scholar"

The Grand Theater will be showing the romantic musical comedy "Foolish Scholar" (It's Great to Be in College) starting today. This film is the latest prestigious production of 20th Century Fox, co-starring ten comedy song and dance stars. Among American films, there have been several with the background of college or football. The film "Foolish Scholar", although also using the above-mentioned themes to describe the romanticization and football craze of American college students, the performance is absolutely different from other films. It has novel songs and dances and novel jokes. From the opening to the closing, the audience only feels lively, interesting and funny. There is absolutely no foot of film that makes people feel dull. This is indeed a rare entertainment film that is worth anyone's smile.

### Random Notes on the "Drama Workshop" Rehearsing "Sunrise"

The long-rumored "Drama Workshop" rehearsal of "Sunrise" is now actively preparing. They often rehearse until late at night. Although it is a cold winter night, they still have no fatigue. Their love for drama is evident.

The director, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, has been particularly busy recently. On the one hand, he is enthusiastically rehearsing "Sunrise", and on the other hand, he is also working as a director in other theater groups.

The script of "Sunrise" needs no introduction. Anyone who has seen Mr. Cao Yu's first work, "Thunderstorm", I think will definitely pay attention to it. In "Sunrise", his deeper observation is more successful than "Thunderstorm". The whole play is tense and vivid, and each scene can arouse the audience's high emotions. The sensation during the performance in the future can be expected.

According to the person in charge of the theater group, after their public performance in Shanghai, they plan to go to Nanjing for another performance. In this way, the capital audience's visual feast is not shallow, so a preview is given first.

Most of the participants in the theater group are former members of the "Fudan Drama Club". Their past achievements are deeply imprinted in the minds of the audience. Other personnel are also first-class talents in the theater world. This collaboration will be even more perfect.
