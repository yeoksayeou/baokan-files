### Enemy Forces Again Break Through Mishidu; We Have Flown in Large Forces to Intercept

The enemy seems to have designs on infiltrating Shihudang. On the west side of Shanghai, we are still defending Zhujiabang on the Suzhou Creek. Fierce battles erupted yesterday at Lincoln Road and Caojiazhai.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 12:25 AM on the 8th: Enemy outpost troops advancing north from Jinshanwei were intercepted by our forces at Mishidu. They were completely annihilated before 9 PM last night. However, their main force continued to advance, and because our troops did not have time to build fortifications, they broke through. Currently, there are approximately 500-600 enemy soldiers along the Huangpu River. We have urgently dispatched large forces to intercept them, and fierce battles have already broken out. Furthermore, according to the latest report received by this newspaper at 1 AM this morning, enemy forces south of the Huangpu River are advancing north in two directions: one from Zhujing (i.e., Jinshan), attempting to infiltrate our positions, which are currently being strongly defended; the other from Mishidu, attempting to attack Songjiang, which is currently under heavy fighting.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 12:25 AM on the 8th: The number of enemy troops on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek is increasing daily, with the main force located in the Liujiazhai area. They have built a heavy wooden bridge, and several tanks crossed the river today, making their attacks even more aggressive. Yesterday at midnight, enemy forces suddenly crossed Lincoln Road and continued to attack our position at Caojiazhai, with heavy artillery fire. Our fortifications were destroyed, so we retreated 200 meters, holding the line at Dongxi Dujiazhai, and coordinating with the Xuejiaku position along the river to the northwest, strictly preventing the enemy from expanding westward. After nightfall, the artillery fire along the entire line was very intense. Although the enemy made some progress on the Zhujiabang line, they suffered heavy casualties. On the front line of Baziqiao, fierce battles raged for over ten hours. Our troops fought bravely, willing to make heroic sacrifices. By 1 PM, the enemy had broken through, but reinforcements launched a counterattack in the afternoon. At the time of the report, our loyal soldiers were braving the rain of bullets and charging towards the enemy. To the east, we are still holding Qiaojiaqiao, south of Zhujiabang, maintaining a stalemate across the river, with street fighting being extremely intense.

### Enemy Troops Landing at Jinshanwei Strictly Intercepted by Our Forces

The enemy south of the Huangpu River will not be difficult to eliminate. The enemy's attempt to encroach on Zhapu was repelled by our forces.

According to the Central News Agency, the total number of enemy troops landing along the coast of Hangzhou Bay is approximately 6,000-7,000. Although their outpost troops managed to infiltrate Mishidu in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, they have been annihilated by our forces. Their main force is still about 4-5 kilometers away from the Hangzhou-Shanghai Highway, and fierce battles have broken out with our forces engaging them. We have also urgently dispatched elite troops across the Huangpu River near Minhang, launching a successful southwest attack. Several other large forces are advancing eastward from Zhaopu, Jiaxing, and other places, sweeping and eliminating the enemy forces south of Songjiang and on the south bank of the Huangpu River within a specified time. Furthermore, enemy troops attempted to land on the coast between Zhapu and Ganpu the day before yesterday at dawn, but were repelled by the local militia and police.

After the enemy troops landed in the heavy fog on the morning of the 6th, at 4 PM that afternoon, the enemy troops advanced from Tinglin to Yexie. Upon hearing the news, the local police and strongmen immediately assembled to meet them, but due to the enemy's fierce weapons, it was difficult to resist. They retreated eastward to the Yexie Dangqiao, and the strongmen and police defended the bridge, holding out for an entire night. The enemy was unable to advance. Later, our troops arrived to join the battle, and the enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated to Tinglin. Therefore, the enemy only reached the western half of Yexie, and the eastern half was not ravaged by the enemy.

Yesterday morning (the 8th), large numbers of enemy planes bombed everywhere. At approximately 9 AM, four enemy planes circled over Yexie for reconnaissance. One plane dropped bombs, but no fire was seen at the location, only black smoke rising. The fiercest battles between the enemy and our forces are taking place between Tinglin and Yexie. Many of our reinforcements are encircling the enemy.

### Enemy Attempts to Invade Jiangqiao Town; Fierce Battles Erupt at Beixinjing

The enemy's attempt to cross the river at Zhoujiaqiao was unsuccessful. The enemy advancing south on Lincoln Road was defeated. Our forces killed countless enemies at Zhangjiangdu.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 12:50 PM on the 8th: Enemy forces appear to be launching a full-scale attack on our Jiangqiao Town. This morning around 4 AM, large numbers of enemy troops were active from Zhuyuan, Guojiazhai, Lujiaxiang, Lijiaxiang to Jisian'an. We have been closely monitoring and preparing for this according to intelligence reports.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 11:20 PM on the 8th: The enemy attempted to cross the river again near Zhoujiaqiao Town. Our artillery bombarded them, and the enemy responded with heavy shelling. From 2 PM to 4 PM, there was a slight pause. Our troops coordinated with the Beigongjiazhai area, and our troops at Caojiazhai also launched a fierce northward attack. The enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated to the northwest. At that time, the enemy used tanks to cross the river, with a total of four tanks. The third tank was destroyed by our artillery fire. After 7 PM, fierce battles began along the entire line from Beixinjing in the west to Zhoujiaqiao in the east. The artillery fire was even more intense than during the day.

### Our Forces Repel Enemy South of Lincoln Road

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 12:50 PM on the 8th: After the enemy successively and stealthily sent reinforcements across the river at Liujiazhai, they launched a fierce attack south. Our important stronghold, Chenggeng, north of Lincoln Road, was destroyed by enemy shelling. Today, the fighting shifted to the area in front of Caojiazhai, south of Lincoln Road. The enemy began with artillery fire at 4 AM, and we returned fire. At dawn, the enemy launched an infantry assault, and enemy tanks also prepared to cross the river stealthily. Our artillery units destroyed their pontoon bridge. Fighting continued until around 9 AM, and the enemy suffered approximately 300 casualties. The battle is still ongoing.

According to the Central News Agency, the fighting on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek is becoming increasingly fierce. From morning to night yesterday, enemy artillery fire did not stop. Enemy planes were also unusually active due to the clear weather. The sounds of bombs and artillery shells mixed with the explosions of machine guns, rifles, and hand grenades. When the reporter went to observe the battle in a certain area of the western district in the evening, the artillery fire was intense, and thick smoke covered both banks of the Suzhou Creek. Judging from the landing points of the shells, they were gradually moving northward. The enemy, having broken through Chenggeng from Liujiazhai, were advancing south along Lincoln Road, but were repelled northward by our counterattack. Several enemy tanks had crossed the river in that area, but they were intercepted by our direct fire guns and lost their effectiveness. In the Zhujiabang area, our counterattack was also quite successful. There was also fierce fighting in the Chenjialong area. Although the enemy broke through at one point, we immediately restored the original position with a counterattack.

### We Kill 400 Enemies at Zhangjiangdu

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 12:50 PM on the 8th: This morning around 2 AM, the enemy again took advantage of the darkness to stealthily cross the river in the Zhangjiangdu and Qiaojiaqiao areas. Our forces had already detected this and launched a two-pronged counterattack. The enemy was caught off guard and wiped out, with casualties reaching 400. The remaining troops fled to Caijiazhai and other places. It is expected that there will be even fiercer fighting this afternoon. A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 11:20 PM on the 8th: After 1 PM, large numbers of enemy troops successively crossed the river at the Zhangjiangdu-Qiaojiaqiao section of the Suzhou Creek, attempting to advance southeast towards Avenue Piaton. At 3:30 PM, our forces launched a full-scale counterattack, and the enemy's forward troops were surrounded and annihilated, with over 300 enemy casualties.

### Situation in Pudong Remains Stable

Rumors of a large-scale enemy invasion are inaccurate. However, the number of refugees migrating is relatively large, and ferryboats are excessively increasing fares.

The situation in Pudong remains stable with absolutely no changes. Rumors of a large-scale enemy invasion are inaccurate. Based on the current situation, Pudong is no longer a strategically important place militarily. The enemy is currently focusing all its efforts on western Shanghai and the north bank of Hangzhou Bay. All the troops in Shanghai are allocated to the current defensive positions, and even then they feel stretched thin, making it even more difficult to divide troops to attack Pudong. Yesterday morning, three enemy planes flew low over various areas for reconnaissance, but did not drop bombs. The reporter inspected the streets in the morning and found the order unusually quiet. However, the number of people migrating is increasing daily compared to before. Ferryboats of all sizes on the Huangpu River are forcibly raising fares, increasing the fare per passenger from ten copper coins to one silver dollar, causing the refugees to cry out in misery. It is hoped that the police authorities will quickly and strictly crack down on this.

Due to the troop deployment in Pudong, the public has misunderstood the situation. Although it rained heavily the day before yesterday, the villagers along the Huangpu River, from Yangjing in the north to Yangsiqiao in the south, were all helping the old and carrying the young, transporting their belongings to Shanghai via Pudong, scrambling to be first, and incidents of boats capsizing were frequent. After the weather cleared yesterday, the ferries were even more crowded. In the past two days, the number of people fleeing is estimated to be between 40,000 and 50,000.

According to the Central News Agency, the Huangpu River was quite calm yesterday. Although the enemy warships docked there were slightly busier than before, their number did not increase. Yesterday, a total of five enemy transport ships sailed to Shanghai, and a total of four transport ships and two Red Cross ships sailed out. Therefore, the total number of enemy warships docked in Shanghai yesterday was twenty-eight, one less than the day before. Yesterday, only one enemy gunboat, docked at buoy number 14, fired more than ten shots at Pudong around 4 PM. We ignored it, and it stopped around 5 PM.

### The Enemy Has Received Reinforcements and Military Supplies

According to the Central News Agency, at 5 AM yesterday, the enemy's transport ship No. 270, Koyu Maru, in addition to carrying many large cannons, also brought a batch of enemy reinforcements of about 1,000 people, who landed at the Qiujiang Wharf. At 2 PM yesterday afternoon, two more enemy transport ships, the Havre Maru and Shanghai Maru, sailed to Shanghai and continued to unload 2,000 reinforcements at the Qiujiang Wharf before sailing inland to dock at the Osaka Wharf and the Huishan Wharf to prepare to transport enemy wounded soldiers to Japan. In addition, at the same time, the enemy's transport ship No. 174, Chojusan Maru, also arrived, carrying a large number of military supplies. From 4 PM yesterday afternoon, unloading began at the China Merchants Bureau's central warehouse. As for the more than 2,000 conscripted strongmen recruited by the enemy in Korea and Taiwan, they disembarked at the Qiujiang Wharf the day before yesterday on two transport ships.

### Enemy Red Cross Ships Carrying Wounded Soldiers Back Home

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy Red Cross ship No. 380, which sailed to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 7th), unloaded a large amount of medical supplies yesterday and then, that night, loaded the ashes of enemy corpses and over 1,000 wounded soldiers, setting sail back to Japan at 5 AM yesterday morning.

The enemy Red Cross ship Bakarun Maru, No. 174, a merchant ship converted into a Red Cross ship, which sailed to Shanghai at the same time as Red Cross ship No. 385 the day before yesterday morning, carried more than 800 enemy wounded soldiers and sailed back to Japan at 3 PM yesterday afternoon.

### Enemy Planes Indiscriminately Bombing Qingpu

The entire city is on fire, with flames raging. The strafing of refugees is especially tragic.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 12:25 AM on the 8th: Ten enemy planes were active in various parts of Qingpu, non-stop from morning to night. Many bombs were dropped in Qingpu city, and several fires broke out. From 10:30 AM, the fires burned until 4 PM without being extinguished. The entire city was almost completely burned down. They used machine guns to fire at passing vehicles, and refugees were massacred, with casualties everywhere. The scene was extremely tragic.

### Nanshi Designated as Refugee Zone; British Consulate to Estimate Losses of British Citizens; Municipal Government Proclamation Implemented

At the same time, he requested the Japanese side not to attack the area. This proposal, a humanitarian appeal, has been approved by our military and political authorities and will be implemented starting at noon today. The designated area is the northern half of the old city, bounded by Minquan Road on the east, west, and north sides, and Fangbang Road on the south side, which can accommodate approximately 100,000 refugees. Public security in the area will be maintained by our police, armed only with pistols and wooden sticks. As for the food supply in the area, the committee will find ways to regulate it. Red Cross flags will be hung around the area for identification. Our side has already made the necessary preparations and will accompany representatives of the International Committee to inspect the area after the arrangements are complete. It is also learned that all public institutions in the area, such as the Yuyuan Garden, the New World, and schools and churches, will be considered for use as shelters. Various refugee relief organizations in this city have been looking for suitable houses in the area yesterday in order to provide shelter. Chen Dekun, deputy director of the shelter group of the Charity Organization Relief Committee, found three places in the area, the New World, the Inner Garden, and the Chenxiang Pavilion, as shelters, and sent more than 1,200 refugees rescued from western Shanghai and Pudong there for accommodation yesterday. The Shanghai Relief Branch found the Zhuyu Guild Hall on Houjiabang Road and other places as shelters. The Shanghai Muslim Refugee Relief Association established the Sixth Shelter in a certain house on Houjia Road. Various native place associations also sought houses in the area yesterday and tried to transfer a large number of refugees.

### Enemy Planes Running Rampant All Day

Dozens of bombs dropped in Pudong; strafing innocent refugees in Nanshi.

Pudong: The entire line in Pudong was very quiet yesterday. The order in various places was also very peaceful. However, around 1 PM in the afternoon, nine enemy planes indiscriminately bombed the banks of the Huangpu River, dropping as many as thirty bombs in areas such as Qichang Wharf, Jiajiajiao, and Shiba Jian Yangjing Port. Over twenty civilian houses were destroyed, but most of the residents had moved away, so there were no casualties. Around 3 PM, two more planes came and dropped seven or eight bombs in Yangjiazhai, Zhuangjiazhai, and Dingjiazhai, destroying five or six civilian houses. Half of the bombs fell into the fields and caused no damage.

At 6:50 PM yesterday afternoon, enemy planes flew to the vicinity of Bailianjing Liuli Bridge in Pudong, dropped bombs, and opened fire with machine guns. Several fishing boats parked there were hit by machine guns, injuring several people.

Nanshi: In Nanshi, enemy planes, ranging from one or two to one or three, took turns circling and spying all day yesterday. Around 1 PM at noon, six enemy planes flew low along the Bund outside Nanshi, probing. At that time, there were a large number of refugees who had fled from our Pudong at the South Wharf. Seeing these innocent refugees without any military defense, the enemy planes wantonly strafed them with machine guns from low altitude. One person was killed and more than ten people were seriously injured at the time. The batch of enemy planes then split up and flew east across the Huangpu River, dropping multiple bombs in Lujiazui, Lannidu, Yangjiadu, and Zhangjiabang in Pudong. The damage is unknown. They gradually left only in the evening.

Two enemy bombers flew to the vicinity of the Gaochangmiao riverside wharf in Nanshi at 8 AM yesterday morning, first strafing with machine guns and then dropping two bombs, one exploding and one not exploding, but there was no damage. At the same time, enemy planes at Zhoujiadu, opposite Gaochangmiao, also dropped two bombs. Simultaneously, two more enemy planes circled over the southern Huangpu River from the Dama Wharf to Gaochangmiao from dawn to noon, strafing with machine guns from time to time, causing civilian boats to dare not cross the river. Therefore, the ferry boats at Gaochangmiao did not carry passengers this morning, and only small boats dared to cross at risk. At 9:20, when enemy planes flew over our military camp, they strafed with machine guns, causing a woman on Guohuo Road to be injured. A total of five or six bombs were dropped in the area from Bansong Garden to Gaochangmiao. The road traffic was temporarily stopped by the militia to avoid danger.

### Fierce Battle in Taiyuan Yesterday

Enemy Troops Bombarded the City with Heavy Artillery; Planes Constantly Dropped Bombs on the City; the Entire Pinghan Enemy Line Has Been Shaken; Our Troops Outflanked and Pressed Towards Shijiazhuang

[Beiping] A fierce battle broke out in Taiyuan this morning. Japanese troops bombarded the city with heavy artillery, and Japanese planes also constantly dropped bombs on the city. At 9:00 a.m. this morning, Japanese troops launched fierce attacks on Taiyuan City from two directions. The Chinese army resolutely resisted, and the battle situation was extremely fierce. (Reuters from Central News Agency on the 8th)

[Nanjing] After the fall of Zhangde, the Chinese army is now retreating to the Baoliansi line of defense, ten miles south of Zhangde. It is reported that Zuo Yi is still commanding the defense forces of Taiyuan, fighting with the enemy, and determined to coexist with the city. (Reuters from Central News Agency on the 8th)

⊙Xinxiang The enemy has been confronting our army on the Zhang River for nearly ten days. Today, we concentrated a large part of our elite troops, bypassing the enemy's rear from the east of the Pinghan Railway, passing through Daming, Yongnian, and Nanhe, and going straight to Shunde, breaking through the enemy's railway transportation. The enemy was caught off guard, and the entire line was shaken. At the moment, our army is continuing to advance, and can approach Shijiazhuang within days. After Shijiazhuang is recovered, the rear of the enemy troops on the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines will be cut off. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)

### Jiang Believes That the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Will Be Successful, Denies Out-of-Conference Mediation

∥Talks with Foreign Correspondents∥

Advocating Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations Is Tantamount to Increasing China's Crisis; Unless Justice and Reason Are Upheld, We Must Resist to the End with Perseverance

[Nanjing] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with foreign correspondents on the afternoon of the 7th and made the following Q&A, which are translated and published as follows: (Reporter asked) If the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing advocates direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, what is the Chairman's opinion? (Chairman replied) Advocating direct Sino-Japanese negotiations is tantamount to increasing China's crisis and is completely contrary to the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Japan disregards righteousness and disregards credibility, and has no respect for justice. If the two countries negotiate directly, without any other guarantee, no matter what the conditions are, the result will inevitably put China's national life in a dangerous situation where it can be eliminated anytime, anywhere, and there will never be an opportunity for independence and freedom. This is not only unacceptable to China, but also unacceptable to the member states of the Nine-Power Treaty. (Q) What is the current military situation and is the future optimistic? (A) The main purpose of our country's war of resistance this time is to maintain the combat effectiveness of our army throughout and consume the enemy's strength as much as possible, so that our army can achieve the goal of sustained resistance. The situation of the war of resistance in the past three months is enough to prove that our strategy has achieved initial victory. Taking Shanghai as an example, our side has no danger to defend in that area, and there are no strong fortifications to rely on. Although the enemy has used all its naval, land, and air forces, relying on its superior weapons and convenient maritime transportation, our army can still deal with it until now and give it a heavy blow. The enemy's major losses are probably the first since the Russo-Japanese War. Recently, although a part of the enemy army has landed in the Jinshanwei area of ​​the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, it still cannot shake our army's Jiaxiang base at all. Therefore, our army can still advance and retreat freely, and always stand in a dominant position. On the northern battlefield, our army in Shanxi is also advancing step by step, fighting for every inch of land. In the past month of rain, it has inflicted heavy blows on the enemy army. The enemy army has spent such a huge price, and what it has obtained is only a line of land along the railway. After that, the enemy army goes deep into the hinterland, and its difficulties must be even greater. In short, the deeper the enemy army enters our hinterland, the more favorable our situation will be, and the final victory will surely belong to our side. (Q) What are the Chairman's observations on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference? (A) I have always firmly believed that the power of justice and reason, once launched, will inevitably achieve its purpose. I believe that the conference will be successful. As far as China is concerned, when international conventions are not effective and justice and reason cannot be upheld, we can only resist the enemy who invades our country with perseverance and to the end. (Q) At the time of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, in the past few days, there were rumors that mediation was being carried out outside the conference. What is the truth? (A) Absolutely not. China's position has always been to respect the Nine-Power Treaty and all international treaties. In addition to sincerely cooperating with the efforts of legal groups, China will never act alone.

### Central Memorial Week Wu Jingheng Reports on the Long-Term War of Resistance

The Advances and Retreats in Long-Term Resistance Are a Necessary Process; Do Not Misunderstand the Advances and Retreats in the Process as Victory or Defeat

[Nanjing] Committee Member Wu Jingheng attended the Central Memorial Week report on the 8th. The original words are as follows:

Comrades, this time is in the midst of a long-term war of resistance. This long-term war of resistance, led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and many powerful comrades, has been planned in great detail and arranged very carefully. As long as we follow the original plan and the original arrangement, and do not let everyone make a mistake, the final victory can be realized sooner or later. When it comes to the long term, let's explain it with common sense. Is it only called long-term if a battle line remains static forever? It is simply impossible in reality. There is no doubt that there are advances and no retreats, advances and retreats over and over again without stopping. Advancing takes some good days, retreating takes some good days, retreating and then advancing again takes some good days. After countless advances and retreats, consuming many, many good days, a real victory or defeat is decided. This is only then called long-term. Being able to resist long-term is beneficial to us and not beneficial to the enemy. Therefore, the enemy is in favor of a quick decision, and we are in favor of long-term resistance. After long-term resistance, the final victory will naturally belong to us. To resist long-term, there must be advances and retreats. The advances and retreats in long-term resistance are a necessary process. Then I have a little contribution today, and I hope that everyone will not misunderstand the advances and retreats in this process as victory or defeat. An individual's psychological effect often affects the success of a momentary mistake, making something that was originally nothing a matter of concern to ordinary people. How do they know that individual psychological effects all arise from habit, and that ordinary views are not facts? Ordinary views regard this kind of war as a strong country invading a weak country, and firmly adhering to the prejudice that strong countries will ultimately have more advancing components, and weak countries will ultimately have more retreating components. They can guess that victory or defeat will be determined by temporary advances and retreats. They can scare themselves blindly and bring others to be afraid and shrink. If this kind of ordinary view is not corrected, it will hinder the long-term plan and long-term arrangement. If everyone in the country thinks that the people who are leading now are all revolutionaries, and recognizes that this war can be said to be resistance, or even a common polite remark, it is simply a revolution. Our revolutionary leaders, firmly remember the Prime Minister's instructions that the revolution has not yet succeeded. The so-called unsuccessful is that they have not yet overthrown the Japanese militarists and other imperialisms. Even if the material is not as good as him at all, it will only increase some long-term hard work. Now everyone must think from a revolutionary point of view, so that they can regard the small advances and retreats in long-term resistance as very trivial matters. For example, if our China had been completely annexed by Japan forty years ago during the Sino-Japanese War, just like the Manchus annexed us, how could we not come out to make revolution today after receiving the trust of the Prime Minister? This resistance is our uprising to make revolution. Now that the revolutionary army has risen, in a short time, it has already restored the provinces in the Yellow River Basin, the Yangtze River Basin, and the Pearl River Basin all at once. Only Taiwan and the four eastern provinces are tightly occupied by him. The three or four provinces in North China are being taken and lost again, and are advancing and retreating. A small corner of Shanghai is like Feng Guozhang occupying Hankou and Hanyang in the Xinhai Year and threatening Wuchang. If we think about it, seven or eight out of ten have already been restored, and only two or three out of ten need to be restored with effort. It is not that we have lost several provinces and dozens of miles, it is that several provinces and dozens of miles are waiting to be conquered. In this way, we should be excited and move forward, so why be afraid? If we talk about strength, during the Xinhai Revolution, the revolutionary party was only one-tenth or two-tenths compared to the Manchus. Today, our proportion compared to Japan is much larger. Where in the world is there a revolutionary army as large as the existing strength of China today? If there is the existing strength of China today and we still do not make revolution, then there will be no revolution in the world. Assuming that we are truly destroyed by Japan today, we must make revolution in the future. When will we have the existing strength of China today again? Therefore, there is no point in calling our resistance today a revolution. Is the diplomacy of the Xinhai revolutionaries as smooth as ours today? Although there are many traitors today, but the old and young remnants of the Xinhai Dynasty, who considered themselves loyal to the emperor and patriotic old-brand traitors, are probably several times more in number. The Zhang Xun and Zhang Zongchang types who constantly made trouble in the past are no different from the troublemakers in the northern and southern battlefields today. In the past, they were eliminated after a little long-term period. Isn't it also relying on a long-term period to eliminate this kind of world-harming bandit today? Therefore, the inevitable victory of long-term resistance is beyond doubt, as long as our psychological effect is not too ordinary, and we do not disturb ourselves. This resistance should be regarded as a small contribution to the revolution, and we wish to be more energetic. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)

### Japan's Purchases of Military Supplies from the United States

Have Increased Fivefold Compared to the Previous Five Years - Report Released by the Pacific Research Association

[San Francisco] According to a report released today by the Pacific International Relations Research Association here, Japan's purchases of military supplies from the United States in the past five years (up to December 1, 1936) have increased more than fivefold compared to the past. During the January 28th Incident in Shanghai in 1932, Japan's total purchases of military supplies amounted to US$12,805,744; in 1933, US$6,039,506; in 1934, US$13,309,846; in 1935, US$12,936,241; and in 1936, it increased to US$15,000,000. In the first five months of 1937, Japan also purchased approximately US$22,000,000 worth of military raw materials from the United States, exceeding 50% of the total military raw materials prepared throughout 1936. Most of Japan's required military raw materials are scrap iron and old steel. Other raw materials may be self-sufficient domestically. From January to May 21 this year, Japan's purchases of raw materials from the United States, in terms of scrap iron and old steel alone, were worth US$21,000,000. In short, what Japan lacks most is raw materials, especially iron ore. As for the air force, Japan purchased airplanes and parts from the United States in 1930, worth a total of US$439,915. In 1932, it suddenly decreased to US$20,400, but in 1933, it gradually increased to US$63,150; in 1934, US$320,562; in 1935, US$950,377; and in 1936, it increased to US$1,000,000. However, in the first seven months of this year, the value of airplanes purchased by Japan from the United States was only US$200,000. This may be because Japan has already become self-sufficient in airplane raw materials, but it is also unknown. (7th, National Telegram)

### War Diary (10)

— Special War Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Chen Wanli

㊂Farewell to Zhangjia Village

Zhangjia Village is a small village near Zhenru, which is where the headquarters of the ×× Army that I mentioned above is located. The Dajiaochang stronghold was broken through by the enemy on the 25th, and the distance between Zhangjia Village and the front line was getting closer day by day. The sounds of rifles and machine guns were transmitted quite clearly, and artillery shells fell nearby, although only two or three out of ten exploded, and the rest were deeply buried in the soil. Enemy planes were even more active day and night, and heavy bombs exploded in our small village, and dense machine guns swept through the village. These situations were tense enough.

Under very tense circumstances, the common people all abandoned their homes and fields, and rushed to leave their old homes with the old and the young, heading for the countryside. This small village, which had undergone the baptism of bombs and artillery shells, appeared even more desolate. However, the headquarters was still stationed here, and Commander × was still commanding the soldiers on the front line to fight in this desolate village. He seemed unconcerned about all the tense situations in this village. This calm and courageous spirit deeply moved me and also deeply moved the soldiers on the front line. I believe that the unprecedented 24-hour bloody battle near Dajiaochang was driven by this spirit.

It wasn't until the evening of the 26th, after the Commander issued the order to retreat to the second line of defense, that he calmly left Zhangjia Village. It was a hazy dusk, with no moon or stars. I silently stepped on broken bricks and tiles, followed everyone, boarded the truck, and sat on top of the high pile of luggage, driving along the Zhenbei Road, along the south bank of the Suzhou River. The wind of late autumn blew on my body, and I shivered slightly. My moist eyes looked longingly at the blurred Zhangjia Village, and I silently recited in my heart,

"Farewell, Zhangjia Village, on what day will we reunite under the flying national emblem of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth?"

㊃The Fate of Bridge No. 1

Before we retreated, Zhenbei Road was the only transportation artery from Shanghai to the front. At the starting point of the southern end of Zhenbei Road, there was a large bridge spanning the Suzhou River, which was Bridge No. 1 of Zhenbei Road.

Since the start of the Shanghai Battle, enemy planes had repeatedly bombed Bridge No. 1, attempting to destroy our only transportation artery from Shanghai to the front, but none of them succeeded. This large wooden bridge still stood majestically on the Suzhou River, shouldering all the heavy responsibilities of transportation.

On the 24th, the enemy used a large number of planes and dropped 57 heavy bombs on this large wooden bridge one after another. However, one of these 57 heavy bombs hit the southern end of Bridge No. 1, and this majestic wooden bridge was damaged by one-third.

On the evening of the 24th, we began to repair the heavily damaged bridge. By the morning of the 25th, pedestrians could safely pass through. By the morning of the 26th, all vehicles could safely pass over the bridge. "Bridge No. 1 was completely repaired, but only one night passed, and on the 27th," after Bridge No. 1 transported tens of thousands of our brave soldiers across the river, it was completely destroyed by a large amount of explosives. From then on, amidst the billowing smoke of artillery fire, we could no longer see Bridge No. 1, which had stood majestically on the Suzhou River.

㊄Only One Brother Returned to Report

Before our retreat, the brothers of the × Division were initially stationed on the south bank of the Wenzaobang (east of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway), and later transferred to the left wing of Dajiaochang. Although they sometimes encountered bitter battles, they were always able to overcome the greatest difficulties and inflict heavy blows on the enemy. Captured items such as rifles and machine guns were continuously transported from the hands of the brothers of the × Division from the front line to the rear. In my memory, the defensive positions held by the brothers of the × Division had never lost an inch of land, but there was one exception. This exception contains a moving story. This story was personally narrated by Commander ×, and it is a very true and heroic historical fact.

In a small village, a company of brothers from the × Division was stationed. At dawn one day, a large force of enemies came to attack this small village. This company of brothers bravely rose up and fought with the enemy. After more than ten hours of continuous bitter fighting, our company of brothers, under the enemy's fierce firepower, suffered casualties until only four were left. They watched as the enemy's heavy artillery frantically bombarded the rear, and large numbers of enemy planes were constantly bombing overhead. The comrades behind them could not reinforce them, but they still tightly grasped their machine guns, preventing the enemy from advancing. At this moment, a person with a Northeast accent shouted loudly in front,

"Fellow villagers, you have been surrounded, quickly hand over your guns and surrender!"

The eight bloodshot eyes of the four surviving brothers in this company were awakened by this loud shout, and they silently looked at each other for a moment. Everyone seemed to nod understandingly, and immediately one brother stood up and replied,

"Okay, we will hand over our guns and surrender." The four immediately moved all the weapons from the hands of their comrades who were lying quietly on the ground, having bravely died in battle, to the front of the position, and then shouted loudly to the enemies in front,

"Come and move all the weapons over." Then more than a hundred enemies, interspersed with a few puppet troops, walked towards our position. When the enemies reached the front of our position, the four surviving brothers in our company immediately attacked the dense enemies with hand grenades, and at the same time continuously swept them with machine guns. Among these more than a hundred enemies, seventy or eighty were killed, and the rest fled back in panic. As for us, three of the four surviving brothers in this company heroically sacrificed themselves for the country along with their comrades. Only one brother remained, and he safely returned with two light machine guns, reporting this heroic historical fact to his superiors.

### Japan Resolves to Reject Attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Again

Gu Weijun Appeals to the United States to Uphold the Treaty and Uphold Justice

Brussels: Representatives of various countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference are now quietly awaiting Japan's reply, or are temporarily resting, or are continuing to meet with each other. The chief representative of the United States, Davis, and the French representative, Tedeschi, had a long conversation today. It is now believed that the two have largely the same views on resolving the Far East dispute through peaceful means. (Central News Agency, 7th, Reuters)

[Tokyo] The Belgian Ambassador to Japan, White Songbi, visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. It is widely believed that this was to deliver the second invitation to Japan to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The Japanese government is afraid that it will still reject this invitation. Because the Japanese government and the public are welcoming and encouraging the establishment of the Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact, they are intoxicated and obsessed with it, and there is no need to worry about the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. According to recent days, various patriotic groups and the general public here have held lantern parades everywhere, and all shops, hotels, theaters, and newspapers have hung the national flags of Japan, Germany, and Italy to show their celebration. From this, it can be seen that they must take a dismissive attitude towards the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (8th, National Telegram) [Tokyo] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated when meeting with reporters today that the Belgian government's second application to Japan, requesting Japan to exchange views with a selected few countries within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty organization, will require a great deal of time and careful research. From his personal point of view, the Japanese government has no reason to change its will. This application was received on Sunday night. Due to the need for research, Japan's reply may be delayed. The spokesperson said that Japan opposes the Soviet Union's attendance at the Brussels Conference, saying that the Soviet Union is not a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, and the powers' invitation to its attendance was not discussed with Japan. The spokesperson denied that Japan had notified Germany of the terms of peace, and rumors about this matter are not credible. (Central News Agency, 8th, Reuters)

Beijing: Today, the chief representative of China, Gu Weijun, made a radio broadcast to the United States, saying that China extremely hopes that the Brussels Conference can decide on its method of assisting China. What the Chinese delegation expects is the complete implementation of the various provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, and the unanimous respect of the signatory countries of the treaty for China's sovereignty, independence, and the integrity of its territory and administration. Gu also pointed out that Italy's claim of direct negotiations between China and Japan is actually a contempt for the lives and property of the people of the powers that have been affected by the war. If we want to maintain the common interests of all countries today, we must respect the rule of law and maintain international peace and security. (Central News Agency, 8th, Reuters)

[Berlin] There is no hope for progress in the initial negotiations on the mediation of the Sino-Japanese War by Germany. Although the French political circles are extremely optimistic about this matter, it is heard that Japan's conditions are extremely harsh. Whether Germany is absolutely fair and impartial is particularly doubtful after the conclusion of the anti-communist pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Chinese side has also pointed out that Germany and China have not concluded the same agreement, and that Chairman Chiang has achieved considerable success in the anti-communist war for many years.

### London Rumors That Russia and Italy Will Sever Diplomatic Relations

Participants in the celebration said that today's situation is the most joyful grand event in the history of the new Russia, because the revolution in 1917 did not initially expect to lead 160 million people into a new political organization. The most important thing in the celebration is the success of the second five-year plan. However, after the singing of the Internationale, there is also a powerful military organization that is sufficient to meet the challenges of the anti-communist organization of fascist countries. At noon, the People's Commissar of Defense, Voroshilov, rode a fine horse into the square and saluted Stalin. Then he saw thousands of gun bayonets flashing together, and in the distance, there was a thunderous sound of salutes, one hundred and one. Subsequently, Voroshilov made a radio broadcast speech, saying that an army is not designed to attack people, but if attacked, its counterattack power will open a new era in world war. If we had not been surrounded by so many enemies, such as Trotsky and other national traitors, the success of the past 20 years would have been far more than this. In addition to the infantry and artillery teams, Voroshilov inspected 485 tanks and 3,000 motorcycles, each carrying a machine gun. The teams of sports organizations were also interspersed among the troops, which is also a first in previous reviews. Unfortunately, there was fog near the airport, so the planes could not participate. (7th, National Telegram)

### The New Belgian Cabinet Will Be Formed Soon

Hymans Declines to Serve as Foreign Minister

Brussels: It is now believed that former Foreign Minister Spaak (the current chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference) will be able to form a new cabinet today, with six members each from the Catholic Party and the Socialist Party, three from the Liberal Party, and one from the independent faction. It is expected that Hymans will serve as Foreign Minister (Note: Mr. Hymans is affiliated with the Liberal Party.

### French Peace Conference Demonstrates Against Aggression

Humanity Unleashes Bestiality

Herriot Speaks Out Loudly

Lyon: The French branch of the World Peace Congress held a large-scale demonstration here yesterday against acts of aggression. Demonstrators paraded through the city in a procession, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and Mayor of this city, Herriot, delivered a speech before more than 10,000 spectators, stating that mankind has recently made progress on the path of barbarism. Considering the wars in China and Spain, undeclared war has become commonplace. There is no longer any distinction between fortified cities and unfortified cities, combatants and non-combatants. War is no different from private assassination. All of this is not what we want to hear. All groups participating in the World Peace Congress must lodge protests to show the conscience of people around the world. As for the cause of world peace, it should still be based on arbitration, security, and disarmament. (Central News Agency, 8th, Havas)

### The Important Factor for Peace Lies in British-Russian Relations

European Situation Nears the Eve of the Great War - French Secretary of State Delivers a Speech

[Paris] French Secretary of State Blum declared at a meeting of the National Committee of the Socialist Party today that the important factor for peace at present lies in the state of relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Blum also said, We are almost at the situation of 1914, when workers in Paris were trying to unite Britain and Imperial Russia. (Central News Agency, Reuters)

[Paris] Secretary of State Blum said in a speech at the Socialist Party Congress today that if Germany and Italy obstruct the plan to withdraw Spanish volunteers, then France must open its borders. The Congress has passed a resolution to continue participating in the Chautemps Cabinet. Chautemps also attended the meeting and said that the Spanish issue must be regarded as part of the serious international situation, and it is not appropriate to weaken the power of the Franco-Russian Agreement at present, because British-Russian relations must be close and are no different from the situation in 1914. Subsequently, the Congress reaffirmed its policy on the Spanish Civil War, that is, if the non-intervention plan cannot be implemented, France should abandon it. (8th, National Telegram)

### The Anti-Communist Bulwark of Japan, Germany, and Italy Endangers World Peace

Military Cooperation and Mutual Consultation - Britain and France May Find It Difficult to Rest Easy

[London] The Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan has recently been continuously commented on by the Mainichi Shimbun, stating, "German representative Ribbentrop made a speech after signing, saying that this agreement is to ensure the world's peace situation. After hearing this, we cannot help but have reservations. If there is only one kind of thing that endangers the world's peace situation, Bolshevism, then we may be more likely to believe Ribbentrop's words. However, what endangers peace is not Bolshevism, but the allied countries that are hostile to this doctrine. This can be imagined from recent events. The anti-communist bulwark composed of Italy, Germany, and Japan now extends from the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, through the Mediterranean Sea, to the Pacific Ocean. Gadda, the chief writer of an Italian newspaper, has also called our attention, saying that the total tonnage of the three countries' warships is 2 million tons and can be concentrated in their respective oceans. In this situation, Britain, France, and the United States have interests in the Mediterranean and Pacific that are vital to their survival, and it is considered that the Anti-Communist Pact poses a direct threat to these countries, more so than to Soviet Russia, so it is natural that they cannot rest easy. Moreover, if there is no Britain in the Far East, then Japan can be called invincible (the United States, to some extent, also makes Japan somewhat apprehensive). If there is no Britain in the Mediterranean, then the French Navy will at least be restrained by the German Navy, and Italy can hold the bull's ear of the western Mediterranean. From this point of view, if it is said that the Anti-Communist Pact poses the greatest threat to Britain, it is not an exaggeration." (Central News Agency, 8th, Havas)

[Paris] French naval authorities today firmly believe that the Anti-Commintern Pact signed by Germany, Italy and Japan must have secret military clauses attached to it. As the Italian navy was conducting exercises in the waters of Gaeta, the German battleship "Deutschland" and four destroyers, including the "Volker," arrived at the scene. Naval authorities believe that this exercise is "not just a coincidence." It poses a serious threat to the territorial communications of Britain and France. At the same time, according to newspaper reports, the results of the Rome talks have decided to make Berlin the capital of the anti-communist front, and a permanent institution will be established there so that the general staff of the three countries' navies and armies can exchange opinions at any time and can change their mobilization plans at any time to cope with any "serious world conflict." It is learned that this plan can be expanded to include other consultation activities, such as the Spanish Civil War, etc. The famous French journalist Madame Tabouis predicted that Germany, Japan, and Italy will establish a naval adjustment plan within February. The content will probably be that the Japanese navy should have sufficient power to deal with the Far Eastern territories of Britain, France, and Russia. Bettina, a political commentator for the Paris Evening News, also predicted that Europe will be greatly threatened, but it is still difficult to guess whether the location of the launch will be Austria, Poland, or Czechoslovakia. (7th, National Telegram)

### A Provocative Action Against Democratic Countries

[Paris] The Anti-Commintern Pact between Italy, Germany and Japan has been continuously commented on by the newspapers here. The right-wing Figaro's correspondent in Rome cabled, "If the world knows that the Anti-Commintern Pact stipulates that each signatory country can freely interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, then this layer will be more and more obvious for the world's democratic countries. The three dictatorships of Italy, Germany and Japan believe that if a certain situation is unfavorable to themselves, they have the right to issue warnings to other countries and use force, so when internal wars occur in various countries, other countries are allowed to interfere." Le Jour reported, "This pact is actually a three-country alliance treaty. Although its declared goal is to deal with the Soviet Union, it can have other goals. The United States is greatly disturbed by this, which is why." The Radical Socialist L'Ordre reported, "Italy, Germany, and Japan are using anti-communism as an excuse to try to revise the current treaty to achieve their own interests. This is an undeniable fact." The extreme right-wing Action Française reported, "The three countries' joint anti-communism is just a smokescreen. If we say that the German leader Hitler and his allies are hostile to the Soviet Union, let us not believe it, because the Rapallo Treaty, which Germany and the Soviet Union concluded when they resumed diplomatic relations in 1922, has not yet been declared abolished, and in terms of economic geography, both sides still maintain considerable connections." L'Humanité, the Communist Party newspaper, reported, "This pact is a genuine alliance treaty between Germany and Italy. The fact that the two sides cooperate with each other when taking intervention actions in the internal affairs of other countries will be confirmed by this pact." Le Jour reported, "The key to the security of the Italian Empire lies in Britain. At a time when Italy needs to strengthen its own security, it is unimaginable that it intends to get involved in the Far East vortex." (Central News Agency, 8th, Havas)

### British Political Circles Disbelieve in Secret Clauses

[London] While rumors circulate that the Anti-Communist Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan includes secret clauses, London does not believe this to be the case. Qualified observers are willing to accept the assurances given by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano regarding this matter. Several sources now believe that although the three countries may have considered adding new clauses to the German-Japanese agreement at one point, it did not materialize. It is said that the German-Japanese agreement has produced very specific results. Germany has existing commercial interests in China, and a number of German military advisors are still employed by the Chinese government. As for the talk that Germany will step in to mediate the Far Eastern dispute, the British have not obtained any evidence to confirm this. Neither the London nor Brussels conferences have requested Germany to take such a step. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 7th)

### British Newspapers Comment that Anti-Communism is a Smoke Screen

[London] The *Manchester Guardian* newspaper stated in today's editorial regarding Italy's joining of the Anti-Communist Pact, that the name of this pact is merely a screen to conceal its content. While Japan is truly concerned about Communism, and Germany to a certain extent as well, Italy is certainly not. Although Japan considers Communism to be a devil, its claim that Japan is suppressing Communism in China is simply outrageous nonsense. Why? Because no government in the world has worked harder to suppress Communism than the Nanjing government led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. In reality, the so-called Anti-Communist Pact is a kind of working agreement among three war-loving countries. The common interest of these three countries lies solely in seizing whatever they can get their hands on, wherever they can reach. British policy has recently been based on the principle that dividing the world into two opposing camps is unavoidable, but whether this kind of effort is still beneficial is now a question. Italy's position, as seen in its signing of the Anti-Communist Pact, has gone against Britain's wishes. Italy will not necessarily fight on the side of Germany and Japan, but diplomatically, it will have to support Germany and Italy. If this is the case, war may be brewing. Furthermore, if the true meaning of this pact is not anti-communism but a conspiracy to obtain benefits, then we must face a fact: this pact is not so much against the Soviet Union as it is against Britain and France, because Britain and France are the source of the benefits they want to obtain. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 8th)

### Austria Declares Non-Alignment

[Vienna] Regarding the Anti-Communist Pact signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan, political figures recently stated that "the Austrian government has repeatedly stated that it will not participate in the policy of dividing into groups, and has no intention of changing this. Austria has long taken an anti-communist stance, and the danger of Bolshevism is an unimportant issue in Austria. The Austrian police are fully capable of gathering all kinds of intelligence to use effective means to stop the illegal activities of the Communist Party." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 8th)

### American Labor Circles Form a Boycott of Japanese Goods Convention

Demanding the Government Ban the Transportation of Military Supplies to Japan, Advising Businesses Not to Purchase Japanese Goods

[San Francisco] The American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Organization Committee, twenty-four branches, today, together with the Chinese Overseas Labor Union, formed the "Boycott of Japanese Goods Convention," and have already nominated a Standing Committee. They sent telegrams to the Department of State and the Department of the Interior, demanding a ban on the transport of military supplies and military accessory supplies to Japan. They sent a letter to the Mexican government, expressing their satisfaction that Mexico is implementing a boycott of Japan. At the same time, they sent a letter supporting French transport workers who refuse to load Japanese goods. The Standing Committee is now planning to advise American businesses to refuse to buy and sell Japanese goods, paying particular attention to the Christmas season. (National Telegram on the 8th)

### Japan Fears "Boycott" (Continued)

— Translated by Wutlai from American writer Utley

Anglo-American Economic Weapons Can End the War

Most of them cultivate for landlords who own fifty acres or more, handing over half of the rice harvested each year to the landlords as rent. The landlords do not provide seeds, fertilizer, or capital. There are also farmers who own their own land, who can cultivate and harvest on their own, but they must pay extremely high interest rates on the capital they borrow, so they are equally impoverished. In short, almost no Japanese farmer is not heavily in debt.

This kind of feudal-era social and economic relationship still exists today, resulting in a very narrow domestic market. The rural people are extremely poor, and even when agricultural product prices are high, they are unable to accumulate capital to purchase machinery and innovate farming methods. This has led to a disproportionate industrial development, with the state ordering large-scale industries using new technologies to produce export goods, such as textiles, as well as the arms manufacturing industry. As for the majority of domestic industries, they consist of a single owner and a few apprentices, sometimes with a few "runners," relying on manual labor or using very little mechanical power.

The lower middle class, such as small landlords who exploit heavy interest, small industrialists, merchants, and artisans, are vast in number, and they are all extremely poor. They bitterly resent the industrial and commercial monopolists who control raw materials, loans, and foreign trade. High interest rates and a narrow domestic market make it impossible for small businesses to become affluent despite their lifelong labor. Japan does not have a middle class with large investments; the capital in the country is controlled by a few financial groups such as Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Yasuda. Although those with an annual income of over 1,200 yuan must pay income tax, in 1931, only 569,046 people paid income tax. Only 20,524 people had an annual income of 5,000 yuan or more. The average income per person is about 800 yuan. But there are twenty people with an annual income of between 300,000 and 1.5 million yuan. Only 730,000 people pay commercial profit tax, and those with annual net profits of 200 yuan or more must pay this tax.

This concentration of capital, though making it easier to pool the nation's income during wartime compared to countries with a larger middle class, makes Japan's social system unusually unstable during crises. The farmers hate the landlords and those who exploit heavy interest (who are actually agents of the banks), and the small industrialists and merchants hate the financial groups, creating a real volcano. The ruling class of Japan often uses war and exciting propaganda to prevent it from erupting. Since 1931, the authorities have channeled social resentment into support for the invasion of China. By seizing Manchuria in one fell swoop, they indulged the people with empty hopes that Manchuria's future prosperity would bring them supreme happiness, thereby suppressing their rebellion. But they discovered that conquering China was not an easy task, and the people, whose belts are becoming tighter, cannot tolerate the suffering of a long-term war. What will happen then is imaginable. Japan gained nothing from occupying Manchuria, but only increased the burden on its people. Japan now hopes to annex North China without a real war, but this cannot alleviate the distress of the farmers and the lower middle class. You cannot save a poisoned person by stuffing their belly with food. The Japanese social structure has too many diseases, which cannot be cured with new colonies where many people can migrate to cultivate. However, only a few hundred Japanese farmers have gone to Manchuria. The Japanese government has not provided capital for immigration to Manchuria. When the Japanese financial and military groups hold great power, this huge capital will never be obtained.

Today's danger is that Britain only seeks to protect its investments in China before Japan devastates China, and is afraid of the impact of a long-term war on Japan. Therefore, it will pressure the Chinese government to surrender, even though the large Chinese army has not been defeated. However, the majority of the Chinese people are determined to resist to the end, which is a real thing. The Chinese army has shown extraordinary courage and determination in Shanghai. Now, as long as Britain and the United States work together to boycott Japanese goods, it can almost be guaranteed that China can defeat Japan. The current British government will never initiate economic pressure on Japan, because the British government wants to see the ruling class of Japan still exist, and hopes to both negotiate a bargain with Japan and pressure China to cede the five provinces of North China to Japan, so as to protect its investment.

However, if the United States decides to boycott Japanese goods and at the same time invokes the Neutrality Act to prevent selling goods to Japan on credit, the British government will have to take the same action as the United States. This move will not only be supported by the Liberal Party and the Labour Party in Britain, but even some parts of the Conservative Party will be happy to support it. If the United States does not help China for moral and logical reasons, it may be motivated by the fact that one of Japan's main ambitions in North China is to turn North China into a large cotton-growing area, so that it no longer has to rely on American cotton. Indeed, for the sake of protecting the permanent interests of American cotton growers, it is worth boycotting Japanese raw silk for a few weeks. The United States' interests in China, in terms of investment scope, cannot be compared with Britain's, but in terms of commercial scope, it cannot be ignored either.

Japan's finances were much stronger in 1922 than they are now, yet at that time, Britain and the United States worked together and forced Japan to spit out the occupied items in China without much effort. Therefore, if Britain and the United States impose political or economic pressure on Japan today, there is no reason to fear that the United States or Britain will be caught in a whirlpool of war. Britain and the United States only need to imply cooperation in implementing economic pressure on Japan to end the war. The United States was able to make British policy consistent with its own in 1922, can it not do so in 1937? (Translated from the New York *Nation*)

### Nationwide Christian Dime Relief Movement

Set a Daily Donation of One Cent, Delivered Daily, Welcome More Donations to Fulfill the Original Intention of Loving and Helping

The Relief Committee of the National Christian Council of China, in view of the increasingly cold weather and the increasingly serious problem of relief for refugees, and the need for relief is a matter of utmost urgency, specially initiated the "Nationwide Christian Dime Relief Movement" to plead for the refugees. Now, the declaration of the movement is copied as follows, respectfully informing you, "Now the west wind is bleak, the weather is getting colder, and the refugee relief problem in the war zone is becoming more and more serious. Moreover, due to Japanese planes indiscriminately bombing non-war zones, the number of compatriots suffering from disaster is increasing day by day. Relief work is even more urgent at present. In view of this, this association, in addition to immediately sending Dr. Gao Bolan to various places for investigation in order to provide relief, has specially initiated the "Nationwide Christian Dime Relief Movement" in order to accumulate small amounts into large sums, to overcome difficulties together, and to enlighten believers to give. Now, the simple rules of this movement are listed on the left, and I hope that my fellow believers will pay attention to them. ㊀ Christians across the country, regardless of men, women, old, or young, should participate in this movement. Non-Christians who serve in Christian organizations are also welcome to participate. ㊁ Each person decides to donate one cent a day for relief purposes. ㊂ Those who are limited by their environment and are truly unable to donate one cent a day can donate one cent every two days, or one cent every three days, or one cent a day per family. ㊃ Those who are willing to donate more are especially welcome. Donors can recognize the amount of daily donations themselves and deliver them daily. ㊄ Donations from staff of churches, groups, or organizations can be handed over to the accountant. Donations from students in various schools can be handed over to the principal. Donations from colleagues in various hospitals can be handed over to the hospital director. Donations from church members in various churches can be handed over to the pastor. Afterwards, the collectors will remit them to this association, and this association will issue official receipts. ㊅ This association is responsible for carefully investigating the situation of disasters in various places and properly distributing the relief donations received to ensure that refugees can receive practical benefits. The above are only draft simple rules, and fellow believers in various places can change and handle them when carrying out this movement, so as to achieve the purpose of this movement to promote relief work. I believe that my fellow Christians have always been compassionate and supportive, and in this time of crisis, relief work is even more obligatory. Therefore, I plead for the refugees and dare to ask fellow believers in various places to actively participate and widely promote it, hoping that this "Dime Relief Movement" can be popularized throughout the country, which is not only the good fortune of the refugees in the war zone, but also the good fortune of the country's future. This is a call, may you all understand."

### A Special Group Recommends to the General Association the Implementation of a Rent-for-Bonds Method

Landlords Should Officially Announce to Tenants, and Be Allowed to Exchange for the Most Recent Month's Rent Ticket

The First Special District Group for National Salvation Bonds wrote to the City Residents Solicitation General Team yesterday, saying that the case of purchasing National Salvation Bonds with rent has already been resolved by the Real Estate Industry Association, and landlords were notified to use one month's rent in September to purchase bonds. However, on the tenant side, because many tenants are in arrears with rent, and want to use bank bond receipts to exchange for rent tickets for September, it is necessary to first clear up the facts of previous rent arrears, which is very difficult. At the same time, the landlords have not officially announced the association's resolution to the tenants, and the tenants dare not purchase bonds on behalf of the landlords, for fear of being rejected, so the purchase of bonds with rent has not been effective. This matter has been submitted to the third joint meeting of all team leaders for discussion, and it is agreed that the country is in such serious difficulty that landlords have a responsibility to contribute wealth to save the country. Landlords should revoke the stipulation that the rent for September be designated. If tenants use one month's rent to purchase bonds on behalf of the landlords, they will be allowed to exchange for the most recent month's rent ticket, and the landlords should announce this method to the tenants in advance, so as to dispel the tenants' doubts, etc. It is recorded in the minutes and is hereby conveyed to the General Association for review and determination of a simple and accurate method to be implemented, so as to benefit the solicitation of bonds, and it is prayed for without limit.

### The Endeavor Steamer Sailing to Ningbo Was Inspected by Enemy Warships

Anchored in Tongsha for a Long Time, Allegedly Because the Nationality Was Unclear

The Italian merchant ship *Endeavor* of the Huayi Company sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 4th. At 9:30 p.m. that evening, the ship was stopped by enemy warships when passing through the waters of Outer Tongsha. Six enemy soldiers boarded the ship to inspect it, and the passengers were quite frightened. After about an hour, they boarded a small motorboat and returned to the enemy warship. However, the ship was anchored for a long time as a result. By the time it continued to sail, it was past 12 o'clock, so the time of arrival in Ningbo the next day was also delayed. It is heard that the enemy soldiers inspected the ship and, according to their remarks before leaving, said it was because the nationality was unclear. It is not known how the Italian authorities will respond to this.

### Shanghai Rice Merchants Flock to the Interior to Purchase

Grain Reserves Will Definitely Increase, and There Is No Need to Worry About a Shortage of Food for the People

Shanghai has a large population, and the food supply requires about 100,000 dan per month. Therefore, the grain merchants in this city always purchase as much grain as possible for storage. During this extraordinary period, the food problem can be relieved because of sufficient storage. According to a thorough investigation, there are currently 600,000 dan of grain reserves, which is enough to meet the needs for half a year. Recently, due to the westward shift of the war and the occasional difficulties in transportation, the authorities of the Chinese Concession have made every effort to dredge the lines, and transportation is still normal. Our country's agricultural production has had a bumper harvest this year, and now that the new grain has been harvested, Shanghai's rice merchants have flocked to the interior to purchase in large quantities for storage. Therefore, food rice will continue to be transported to Shanghai in the future, and grain reserves will definitely increase. There is absolutely no need to worry about a shortage of food for the people.

Yu Songnian, a member of the third detachment of the first brigade of the Shanghai Student Wartime Service Group, is enthusiastic and loyal to wartime service, and is not afraid of hardship. Recently, he was injured by a bullet while participating in the service of a certain division on the West Shanghai battlefield, and has gone to the Aurora University Wounded Soldier Hospital for treatment.

### Group Briefs

The Red Swastika Society's relief team braved the muddy roads last night and set out for the front lines. They rescued twenty-six wounded soldiers in the areas of ×× and transported them to the society's various hospitals for treatment. It is also reported that the Hankou branch of the society, due to the increasing number of refugees passing through from the north and south, intends to establish shelters and temporary hospitals to provide accommodation, resettlement, rescue, and medical treatment. Furthermore, the Chongming branch has already established three shelters and is actively working on accommodating and resettling refugees.

The Shanghai National Products Industry Salvation Service Corps convened a board meeting yesterday, chaired by Yuan Baoli. They resolved on a recent work plan to strengthen the organization internally by cultivating new cadres, and externally to seek cooperation from Shanghai's manufacturers to participate in national salvation. They will also send personnel to advise shops that have not yet reopened to do so, and send a letter to the Shanghai Dancing Girls Salvation Association to urge its members to purchase only domestic goods for their clothing and accessories. More than twenty students from Sichuan studying in Shanghai, including Liao Zongxian and Li Cangruo, are planning to organize a homebound propaganda team to promote the significance of the government's long-term resistance to the enemy and to increase awareness among their fellow villagers. Over fifty people from the political, business, and academic circles of the province in Shanghai have already joined the initiative. It is reported that the team is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on the 11th at the Qingping Assembly Hall to discuss implementation methods, and will send a telegram to Sichuan Chairman Liu Xiang reporting on the recent situation of fellow villagers from the province in Shanghai. The Shanghai YMCA, in order to adapt the lives of young people to the needs of the extraordinary times, has specially hired experts such as Zhang Naiqi and Jiang Wenhan, and twelve others, to form a youth affairs committee. They have held multiple meetings to discuss the basic work procedures for youth in extraordinary times and have developed detailed plans, covering moral, intellectual, physical, and group education, to ensure that the daily lives of young people during this extraordinary time have something to follow.

### Issues in Wartime Foreign Trade Adjustment

— Wu Yugan

The enemy's blockade of our country's coast is not only intended to cut off the source of our military supplies but also to destroy our entire foreign trade. It is already difficult to maintain a few foreign trade routes, let alone promote foreign trade during wartime. Dalian, Tianjin, and Haikou in the occupied areas are effectively controlled by the enemy, needless to say; Qingdao, which is ostensibly not blockaded, is virtually blockaded as well. Under the current situation, only Shanghai can barely be maintained; however, because the enemy constantly inspects foreign ships and most foreign ships are unwilling to navigate war zones, many foreign ships unload goods that should be shipped to Shanghai in Manila, Singapore, and Hong Kong. At the same time, foreign insurance companies refuse to insure goods destined for China against war risks, making it even more difficult to find goods willing to risk being shipped to China. Even if a few goods are shipped in, the current lack of warehouses, docks, and transportation for passengers and cargo makes it extremely difficult to ensure smooth transportation. The import of military supplies is even more difficult, needless to say. Outside of Shanghai, only Hong Kong, with its special status, can still use the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway for cargo transportation; however, even that is difficult to maintain under the enemy's large-scale and indiscriminate bombing. Therefore, when we talk about wartime trade adjustment, the first thing we need to do is to maintain trade routes.

However, with trade routes currently so obstructed, how can we maintain convenience? I believe there are two approaches: short-term and long-term. The short-term solution is for the government to urgently establish control over transportation, setting up a transportation agency that is closely linked to the military and has national control to manage the national transportation network and handle responsible transportation matters. If transportation can be adjusted, we will not be afraid of the enemy's destruction and obstruction of transportation. At the same time, another matter closely related to promoting the flow of goods is the issue of war risk insurance. Without war risk insurance, goods during wartime are too unprotected. However, ordinary insurance companies are unwilling to provide war risk insurance. Since last year, the war risk insurance for a small number of merchants' goods has mostly been reinsured by foreign companies, but now even foreign companies are unwilling to provide it, so imported goods dare not come, and exports are naturally stagnating. The best solution now is for the government to allocate a large amount of capital to establish an agency for war risk insurance. As a result of risk diversification, the government may not necessarily suffer losses, and public and private cargo transportation will be guaranteed, which is an essential plan for promoting cargo transportation and communication. As for the fundamental way to maintain trade routes, it is to ensure that seaports are not threatened or blockaded by the enemy, which means we only have the sea route to Annam. The Annam defense has a railway to Yunnan via 滇 Yue, but it is somewhat circuitous and remote; however, there is also another railway via Hanoi to Longzhou in Guangxi, which is relatively convenient. If we rush to complete the Hunan-Guangxi Railway to connect with this route, then major domestic railway lines such as the Yuehan, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Hunan-Guizhou railways will be conveniently connected. With convenient domestic and foreign transportation, we can have large-scale transportation and not be afraid of the enemy's blockade of seaports. If we want to maintain a permanently convenient and safe trade route during the long-term war of resistance, I am afraid there is no better way than to quickly complete this route.

Once we have a way to maintain trade routes, we can talk about the various issues of adjusting foreign trade during wartime. Here, I believe there are several urgent matters that should be handled first.

㊀ Establishment of a wartime foreign trade control agency. The International Trade Bureau that was originally established in our country may not be sufficient to undertake this task under the current wartime situation. It is best to form a committee composed of military, financial, economic, industrial, and diplomatic representatives. This agency should have two tasks: First, to regulate import and export commodities. Only military supplies, national defense industrial supplies, transportation supplies, and other wartime necessities are allowed to be imported; otherwise, various methods will be used to prohibit or restrict them. Export commodities will also be considered based on the needs of the country during wartime to determine whether or not to export them. This is on the one hand to meet wartime needs; at the same time, it is also to take advantage of wartime opportunities to create a natural trade balance and try to solve our country's long-standing trade deficit problem. Second, for the sake of trade balance and to promote wartime export trade, it can negotiate exchange trade agreements with various countries. During wartime, the import of military supplies is relatively high, and exports are quite difficult. Now, using exports as a condition for import exchange to negotiate exchange trade with various countries is naturally relatively easy.

㊁ Promotion of the business of quasi-state-owned trade organizations. Here, I believe that the Central Trust Bureau should be responsible for the import of all government military supplies and economic construction supplies during wartime. Although we do not explicitly declare "trade nationalization," during wartime, at the very least, all items used by the government should be centrally purchased by the government. The Central Trust Bureau has many advantages in acting as the government's agent in this matter: ㊀ The demand for war supplies is high, and the import volume is particularly large. Centralized procurement ensures that prices are not manipulated. ㊁ The Central Trust Bureau has a strong financial position and flexible financial operations due to its status. ㊂ Government agencies can have a good grasp of the required quantities, and all aspects can be considered comprehensively. ㊃ Because of the government's large-scale purchases, we can use this economic relationship as a diplomatic tool and as a condition for exchanging goods. ㊄ The government can purchase in bulk at lower prices, and private orders can also be entrusted to the government for handling. As a result, the power of the entire country's import trade can be invisibly centralized and unified, overthrowing the current situation of being manipulated by foreign merchants. Therefore, the government should also issue a clear order that all levels of government must comply. This simple matter has a great effect.

㊂ Promotion of the business of major specialized trading companies. The already established major specialized trading companies, such as the China Tea Company, the China Cotton Company, the China Oil Refining Company, and the various provincial mining companies, all have considerable capital and have considerable power to control their respective industries. In the future, we should immediately try to continue to expand their business to create a strong national industrial authority in each industry to develop our country's export trade. These companies and the Central Trust Bureau mentioned above, which focuses on import business, are in opposite but mutually complementary positions. The focus of these specialized trading companies should be on improving the quality of their products, improving the transportation of their business, and expanding the overseas sales of their goods to achieve the goal of increasing export trade. We must understand that during wartime, all difficulties mean that if various export goods do not have such strong specialized trading agencies to promote them, they may really end up in a situation where they are "discarded on the ground." Therefore, I hope these specialized trading companies will make special efforts. If there are some major export commodities that do not yet have similar organizations established, the government should also promote and encourage them, either through joint government-business ventures or through joint industry associations. In short, in such extraordinary times, if we want to expand foreign trade, we must have trading companies with strong control to handle it. On the one hand, it can promote the development of wartime export trade, and at the same time, it can take advantage of the wartime opportunity to sweep away the forces that have always been manipulated by foreign merchants.

Current Commentary

### The Situation in Punan

— Yi

The enemy troops landing at Jinshanwei have been besieged and attacked by our elite troops for days, greatly weakening their momentum. The two important strongholds of Songyin and Zhangyan were also recovered by our troops yesterday. The enemy's sinister attempt to cross the Huangpu River and cut off the retreat of our Shanghai garrison has failed. This has undoubtedly eased our anxious mood about the future of the Battle of Shanghai in recent days. However, the enemy's foothold in the Jinshan coastal area, which is adjacent to the Zhapu fortress and crisscrossed by ports and harbors, is easy to defend and difficult to attack, and is not far from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. From a military point of view, this area is extremely important. If we do not recover it in the shortest possible time, the enemy will build a base there, and the subsequent landing of reinforcements will be enough to cause a major problem. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the situation in this area.

Regardless of how the situation develops in the future, we believe that our military authorities will be able to handle it with ease and will not allow the enemy to gain much advantage. The enemy troops who landed at Jinshanwei have already been annihilated by our troops in large numbers, and the enemy's inability to advance in two directions further proves the solidity of our main national defense zone. Even if the enemy diverts its frontal forces and concentrates on opening up a path in this area, it will only expand the battle line. From the perspective of the long-term war of resistance, there is no cause for pessimism.

### National Products Industry Association Calls on the Nation to Pay Attention to Enemy Goods Being Sold Under False Pretenses

List of Products from Member Manufacturers Notified for Inspection by Chambers of Commerce in All Provinces and Cities

The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association stated that, due to the invasion by the brutal enemy, the people are motivated by patriotism and unanimously refuse to use enemy goods. However, unscrupulous merchants and traitors are colluding to disguise enemy goods as national products or European and American goods in an attempt to sell them under false pretenses in the market. The association has already issued a notice to all sectors of Shanghai to pay close attention. Now, according to information, the disguised enemy goods are mostly being sold in the interior. At this time of full-scale war of resistance, the economic defense line should be strengthened and established. Therefore, the association's standing committee decided yesterday to send a telegram to the chambers of commerce and anti-Japanese support organizations in all provinces and cities across the country, urging them to strictly intercept the disguised enemy goods being smuggled in. If any suspicious activity is discovered, it should be reported and thoroughly investigated. In addition, the products of the association's member manufacturers have all been issued with certificates. The association also plans to send a list of these products to relevant agencies and public organizations in the interior for reference to facilitate identification.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Responsible for Regulating People's Food Supply

Grave Punishment for Profiteering Merchants

The Shanghai Municipal People's Food Regulation Committee, in view of the fact that new grain has been harvested and rice merchants in the city are rushing to the interior to purchase it, ensuring that there will be no shortage of food for the people, decided at its eighth committee meeting to conclude its operations by the 7th of this month. In addition to announcing the conclusion in Public Notice No. 10, it also reported to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau yesterday ordered the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, (details omitted): "The chamber is the highest leader of commercial organizations. Now that the People's Food Regulation Committee has concluded its operations, the chamber should be responsible for matters related to the people's food supply and supervise the rice industry organizations in the city to handle them properly. This order is to be followed."

Since the Shanghai Municipal People's Food Regulation Committee announced the conclusion of its operations, some rice merchants have taken the opportunity to hoard and raise prices, disrupting the market. The prices charged by rice shops are generally exorbitant and often exceed the regulations, with prices reaching more than fourteen yuan per dan. Some people have reported the situation to the Shanghai Municipal Xilian Yihui. In addition to sending personnel to investigate separately to verify the facts, it is emphasized that during this extraordinary period, the people's food supply is of utmost importance. Hoarding and profiteering are strictly prohibited, and raising prices is not allowed by law. Violators will be punished according to martial law and treated as traitors. Now that it is late autumn and new rice is flooding the market, the normal price per dan would be no more than seven or eight yuan, but the current regulated price is still fourteen yuan per dan, which shows that the authorities have been extremely considerate of the difficulties faced by merchants. However, some profiteers are still taking the opportunity to raise prices and disrupt the market. Therefore, the association has issued a notice to all citizens to report any rice shops that sell rice at prices higher than the regulations, providing details and evidence to the association, which will compile the cases and submit them to the Martial Law Command for severe punishment according to law to deter profiteers.

### Martial Law Command Investigates Traitors

Documents Transferred to Court for Arrest

According to the Central News Agency, since the outbreak of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, soldiers at the front have fought heroically, and the people from all walks of life have rushed to transport supplies. Even businessmen with a little conscience and national spirit have been inspired to sacrifice their families to help the country. However, some shameless merchants have openly violated government bans, or taken the opportunity to sell enemy goods, or provide the enemy with grain and metals. For example, Xie Keming of the Renqi Machinery and Dyeing Factory in this city purchased tens of thousands of bolts of Dongyang cloth from the Gongda Yarn Factory in mid-October with hundreds of thousands of yuan in cash. Li Aidong, a comprador of Mitsubishi Yangxing, supplied 10,000 dan of rice to the enemy. Chen Chunong of the Tonghe Public Customs Brokerage sold a large quantity of steel and metals to the enemy. After being reported and the facts verified, it is reported that the Martial Law Command has now transferred the documents to the local court for arrest and investigation.

### Songjiang Red Swastika Society Escorts Refugees to Shanghai Yesterday

Enemy Planes Strafe, Wounding an Elderly Woman; More Than a Hundred Refugees Arrive Safely in Shanghai

Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, Songjiang has been bombed by enemy planes, and much of the city has been reduced to ashes. On the 6th and 7th, the enemy invaded Jinshanwei and Tinglin, making the situation in Songjiang even more critical. Residents are flocking to Shanghai, helping the old and carrying the young, walking along the Songjiang Road. The Songjiang Red Swastika Society has hired several trucks to risk escorting them along the way for several days. Yesterday (the 8th) at 1:00 PM, Zhou, the captain of the team, escorted more than a hundred refugees to Shanghai. While passing between Caohejing and Beiqiao, two enemy planes suddenly appeared and strafed with machine guns. Fortunately, the team members were alert and took cover appropriately. Only an elderly refugee, Yao (61 years old, from Songjiang), was hit by two bullets in her legs, and the society's ambulance with license plate 13133 was hit by more than ten bullets, damaging the head and tires. The team members still managed to transport her to Shanghai, and the injured woman was sent to Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital for treatment.

### Labor Salvation Association Plans to Establish Branches in Various Regions

Concentrating Efforts to Resist to the End

Since the Chinese Labor Salvation Association was formally established in Shanghai some days ago, it has found the Minli Middle School in Nanshi to be its office location. It has started actively working these past days. In order to strengthen the organizational forces, the association has sent letters to the elected committee representatives from all provinces, requesting them to establish local salvation branches within a short period of time. At the same time, the association's propaganda department is currently planning to publish a salvation journal to be sent to labor communities in various regions. In Shanghai, it plans to publish wall newspapers to be distributed to factories and refugee shelters to expand anti-Japanese propaganda. It will also hold training classes for mobile propaganda team cadres, wartime labor learning schools, and wartime service groups to gather the strength of the entire labor community to resist to the end for national survival.

### Commander Yang Maintains Commerce, Inspection Should Not Impede Goods

Any Obstruction to Merchants Is Inappropriate; Soldiers Who Deliberately Violate Can Be Named and Reported

Since Yang Hu, the commander of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command, established a passport registration and inspection office in accordance with the commander-in-chief's order, he has been allowing the passage of goods transported by government agencies based on their passports, and facilitating the passage of ordinary commercial goods based on the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's certificates. It is now reported that some staff members have not fully understood the regulations and are obstructing commercial goods with chamber of commerce certificates. For example, at 2:30 PM on November 5, Liu Xiaozhang intercepted commercial goods in front of the Maochang Clothing and Mirror Shop at Laobeimen. On the 6th, he detained the iron material work tools of Yin Zhengxing at the same location. Also on the 5th, personnel from the rice pier and office of Yu Chang Rice Company in Nanshi detained 100 jars of yellow wine with sales and alcohol tax receipts and a chamber of commerce certificate. Even Zhu Suihua, the manager of Wansen Wine Workshop, was detained. On the 6th, Xin Cheng Coal Company was also obstructed while transporting one ton of coal with a certificate. All of these are inappropriate. The troops have been strictly ordered to comply with the commander-in-chief's order and not obstruct the transportation of commercial goods in the future to maintain production in the rear. If anyone dares to deliberately obstruct, merchants who have been harmed are encouraged to provide the address, date, and soldier's number and report the facts so that they can be punished according to law.

Mr. Miao Zhongxi from the Adjustment Committee will also be present to present everything. We hope that your factory will send a responsible representative to attend and discuss together. We look forward to it."

### Fire Report for September

Number of Ambulance Dispatches Unprecedented; Losses in Concessions Valued at Over 3 Million

According to the report from the Director of the Fire Department of the Public Works Department, the work of firefighters in September of this year was very heavy. There were forty more fires in the concessions than in September of last year, and the number of ambulance dispatches reached an unprecedented record (796 times), which was even fourteen more than in August, which is alarming. A total of 956 patients and injured people were transported to hospitals, of which 348 were injured by shrapnel or stray bullets. The property lost due to fires was valued at over 3.34 million yuan in national currency within the concessions, and over 8,000 yuan in national currency on roads outside the concessions. The property that was in danger was valued at over 51.04 million yuan in national currency within the concessions, and over 70,000 yuan in national currency on roads outside the concessions. From 8:06 PM to 12:10 AM on September 18, it was the busiest time for firefighters. During this period of four hours and four minutes, fire trucks were dispatched eight times. The fires all occurred in the Yangshupu area. At that time, planes were dropping bombs in the area, causing fires in factories and residential buildings. The time, location, and damage are reported as follows: ㊀ 8:06 PM, Yihua Yarn Factory, Yangshupu Road, the cotton batting room and part of the machinery caught fire, damage was light. ㊁ 8:30 PM, 6 four-story buildings on Dongbailao Broadway Road, near Gongping Road, were destroyed by fire. ㊂ 9:20 PM, a five-story warehouse on Zhaofeng Road near Dongxihuade Road was completely reduced to rubble. ㊃ 10:35 PM, a batch of Chinese-style residences on Dongxihuade Road near Dongbailao Broadway Road were destroyed by fire. ㊄ 11:33 PM, the egg loading room of Peilin Foreign Firm on Yangshupu Road was heavily damaged, and a two-story brick building of Shanghai No. 1 Factory on Qiqihar Road, Yangshupu Road, caught fire and was completely destroyed. ㊅ 12:12 AM, a coal yard and coal ball factory on Disiwei Road near Dongbailao Broadway Road were burned down, and a warehouse and some stock of the China Soap Company on Yangshupu Road were also destroyed by fire.

Since the Yangshupu Fire Brigade moved back to its original location at the end of August, its performance has been outstanding. The fire brigade's two fire trucks were dispatched 36 times in September.

In September, the fire brigades used a total of over 4 million British gallons of water, which is only half of the amount used throughout last year.

Firefighters often work near the front lines, which is quite dangerous. Sometimes stray bullets are flying, and they have to leave the fire trucks and find shelter. On September 24, firefighter No. 237 was unfortunately killed by a bullet while serving on Disiwei Road.

The Director of the Public Works Department's Fire Department was deeply impressed by the bravery and dedication of the firefighters and members of the volunteer reserve team.

### Three Fires Occurred the Day Before Yesterday

Yong'an Warehouse Suffers Fire

At 4:00 PM on the 7th, a warehouse of Yong'an Company at 1616 Yangshupu Road caught fire. The fire brigade from the concession was dispatched to extinguish the fire. The south two-story roof of the warehouse was severely damaged. Fortunately, there was not much stock in the warehouse. At 4:30 PM, there was a fire in the western district. The fire truck was dispatched to the railway line, but because the fire location was in the war zone, it was impossible to put it out.

### Retreat of Shanghai West Defense Line, Our Troops Ordered to Defend Nanshi to the Death

Establish Close Contact with the Nanxiang-Qibao Line; Songjiang Was Once Critical, Now Still in Our Troops' Hands; Enemy Planes Bomb and Set Fire to Longhua and Gaochang Temple Areas

The enemy launched a large-scale landing at Jinshanwei, capturing our Zhangyan and Songyin positions, and advancing directly to Mishidu, attacking our Songjiang, attempting to cut off the retreat of our Songhu troops, in order to achieve their goal of a swift and decisive victory. Our troops flanked and ambushed, and blocked them tightly, once recovering Songyin and Zhangyan. The enemy then reinforced and counterattacked, relying on the firepower of their planes and artillery. Our troops were forced to move to a new position. Last night, a bloody battle took place between the two sides in the suburbs of Songjiang, with continuous artillery fire and an exceptionally fierce battle. At midnight, the enemy heavily surrounded the area, and Songjiang was in danger. This morning, our fresh troops arrived and charged into the enemy's formation, and were able to relieve the siege. Currently, Songjiang is indeed still in our troops' hands. The two armies engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and the enemy ultimately did not succeed. As for our troops on the south bank of the Suzhou River in Shanghai West, in order to avoid significant sacrifices, they moved back slightly, holding firmly to the line of Nanxiang and Qibao towns. At the same time, our garrison was ordered to defend Nanshi to the death and fight the enemy to the end. A portion of our troops in Pudong also moved to Nanshi to assist in the battle. This morning, many enemy planes flew over Longhua, Gaochang Temple, and Rihui Port, dropping bombs, and several houses caught fire, with black smoke rising into the sky, but it did not damage our fortifications. Refugees gathered at Xujiahui, Fenglin Bridge, and other places, and the French Concession strengthened its defenses at the border, and the situation was quite tense. Our military authorities stated that the Nanxiang-Qibao line has established close contact with Nanshi, and the Nanshi garrison has long been determined to sacrifice everything. All preparations have been completed, and they are fully capable of engaging in a desperate struggle with the enemy.

According to the Central News Agency, our troops on the south bank of the Suzhou River in Shanghai West made a strategic retreat necessary for adjusting their positions and fighting again. However, the highest authorities ordered the officers and soldiers who were ordered to defend Nanshi to hold it firmly with the determination to die, vowing to fight the enemy to the end. At the same time, there were no changes in Pudong. Therefore, the Shanghai battle, which lasted for eighty-eight days of bloody fighting, has not only not ended, but has also created a more favorable situation for a long-term war of resistance. This is something that all compatriots across the country should deeply recognize. When our troops in Zhabei retreated on the 26th of last month and retreated to the south bank of the Suzhou River, our loyal and brave soldiers fought bitterly with the enemy, relying on crude fortifications, suppressing them for two weeks. Their morale was strong, heroic, and extraordinary, repeatedly inflicting great wounds on the enemy troops crossing the river to attack. However, the enemy's land and air forces concentrated their fierce artillery fire and continuously bombed, causing a lot of damage to our fortifications. At the same time, the enemy who landed at Jinshanwei concentrated their forces to advance forward, fiercely attacking Songjiang, causing our troops in Shanghai West to worry about being threatened, and had to make a strategic move. Before 1:30 this morning, the two armies facing each other across Zhujia Bang were still in continuous artillery fire, fighting fiercely. However, our large forces, under the cover of the fierce fighting on the front lines, made an orderly retreat. Around 2:00, our troops first abandoned the strongholds of Toyota Spinning Factory and Zhoujiaqiao, and retreated to the line along Guanghua University West to the East-West Du Residence to the North Xinjing South Magou Bridge. Around 3:00, the Zhujia Bang line also moved south along the Piaece Road. Around 5:00, a fierce battle broke out near the Lu Family Residence on the north bank, completely surrounding and annihilating more than two hundred enemy troops. Our troops then completely retreated to the new position, holding to the death along the Hongqiao and Longhua lines. At the same time, on the Nanshi side, the authorities ordered Police Chief Cai Jinjun to lead the city's police and a strong unit of a certain division to defend it to the death, and decided not to give up. The morale of our troops is strong and increasing, and they are now waiting in strict formation, vowing to fight the violent enemy to the end.

### Our Troops Firmly Defend the Nanxiang-Qibao Line

We Have Built Extremely Strong Fortifications North of the Highway

The enemy on the south bank of the Suzhou River has been gradually crossing the river to reinforce and launching fierce attacks southward for several days. Our right wing has been engaged in extremely fierce battles with the enemy day after day. Although enemy planes and artillery have been constantly bombarding, our officers and soldiers are still bravely fighting, advancing one after another, and not retreating slightly. Since yesterday, several points in Zhangjiangyu and Qujiaqiao have been broken through by the enemy, and the enemy in the Liu Family Residence has also increased significantly. After the defensive fortifications along Lincoln Road were damaged by enemy artillery fire, our troops retreated slightly from the lines of Piaece Road and Lincoln Road last night for strategic reasons and to consolidate the defense line. Currently, our troops are firmly defending Nanxiang, Jiangqiao, and Qibao, and along the Baozao Highway to Xujiahui. Our troops have built extremely strong defensive fortifications north of the highway. Today, the enemy still dares not advance south along Hongqiao Road. Large numbers of enemy planes are bombing along Hongqiao Road and Longhua, Xujiahui, and South Zhongshan Road. Our fresh troops have arrived at the front lines from □□ to defend Nanshi. If the enemy invades, they will fight to the death.

### Songjiang and Nanxiang Turn from Danger to Safety

The Enemy's Attempt to Disturb Shihudang Fails; More Than One Hundred Enemies Killed in Zhangjia Village

The enemy, numbering about several hundred, entrenched in the Mishidu area in the upper reaches of the Pujiang River, sneaked to the narrowest part of the Jiangshui River at Chuanlaimiao last night, crossed the river and landed on the shore, reaching Zhangjia Village, six or seven miles outside the south gate of Songjiang, attempting to disturb Shihudang. We had heavy troops stationed there. Although the enemy was stubborn, they ultimately failed to succeed. However, last night, near Zhangjia Village, our troops fiercely resisted the enemy, and the battle was fierce. The sounds of gunfire and artillery in Songjiang City could be heard clearly. For a time, rumors abounded, and everyone was on edge. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers resisted fiercely, killing more than one hundred enemies. The enemy's momentum was greatly reduced. This morning, the area was slightly quieter. Our troops have gained an absolute advantage, and the people's hearts have been stabilized.

### Large Fire in Southern Shanghai Not Extinguished by Noon

Since our troops moved the line south of the Suzhou River to the Qibao area this morning at around 1:00, and resolved to defend Nanshi to the death, Nanshi suddenly became tense, and residents moved to the French Concession one after another. The main roads of transportation between China and France were congested, and the situation was miserable. This morning, enemy planes flew to the Longhua and Gaochang Temple areas again to drop bombs, causing a large fire to break out, with smoke covering the sky. A large fire also broke out at the Da Shanghai Rubber Shoe Factory and nearby civilian houses across from Rihui Port on Xie Xu Road, but it was not caused by being hit by bombs. As of the time this publication went to press, it was still burning fiercely.

Also, at around 8:30 this morning, a fire suddenly broke out in residential houses across from the Kaiming Middle School on Nanshi Manufacturing Bureau Road for unknown reasons. The fire brigades from various districts in Southern Shanghai rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and tried their best to put out the fire before it was extinguished. Two rooms were burned down. At the end of West Zhongshan Road and on Warren Road in Shanghai West, a fire suddenly broke out due to bombing at midnight this morning, spreading and burning fiercely, with black smoke covering the sky. As of noon at 12:00, it had not yet been extinguished. It is said that a large number of civilian houses and factories in the area have been destroyed, and the losses are very heavy.

### Enemy Troops Invade Fengxian in Southern Pudong

The Enemy Lands at Zhelin and Qianjiaqiao; Our Troops Are Currently Resisting Bravely

Since the enemy landed at Caoging and Jin Sin Nang and other places in Fengxian, they have been subjected to enemy air raids. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Fengcheng was bombed, destroying a part of the school and the houses of the judicial office. On the morning of the 4th, Zhelin, West Xinshi, Qianjiaqiao and other places along the coast were bombarded by enemy naval guns, and the entire town was destroyed. At 1:00 p.m. on the 5th, the county government in Nanqiao, as well as the grain committee's granary and the Yu Ji in the Shizi Street were bombed one after another, killing and injuring many people. On the same day, Xiaotang Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, about five miles away from Nanqiao, was bombed, destroying the residence of Diao Ren and more than 20 urban houses in the Shiqiaotou area of the town, killing about eight or nine people and injuring many more. Unexpectedly, after the enemy invaded Tinglin and Jiangzhuang, they attacked Yexie to the west and Shengzimiao to the east. Our army resisted bravely at the Xiaozhoujia Cemetery, killing many enemies. On the evening of the 7th, it was suddenly reported that the enemy had also landed on the beaches of Zhelin and Qianjiaqiao. In the middle of the night, a fire suddenly broke out in Nanqiao. It was said that the enemies on the beaches of Zhelin and Qianjiaqiao would directly attack Xixincun, Qingcun, and Fengcheng. Therefore, administrative agencies such as the Silk Mansion and other bureaus had to retreat to a safe area. Now our army is resisting. At the same time, the strong men's teams and other teams in various places are also attacking according to the requirements, and their momentum is quite brave. However, although there is a Red Cross branch there, entrusted to the county hospital, to treat the wounded, the accommodation is limited and the situation is extremely difficult. All the refugees who were affected by the disaster did not escape because of the sudden incident. Fortunately, various charitable organizations in Shanghai quickly took action to rescue them, which should not be delayed.

### Enemy Planes Run Rampant This Morning

Enemy Planes Reconnoiter and Bomb in Southern Shanghai; Refugees in Pudong Tragically Straffed

This morning (the 9th) at about 5:45, enemy planes from Wusong had already come out in droves to run rampant. A certain gentleman heard the sound in his sleep and immediately put on his clothes and went out to see that the street lights in the road were not yet extinguished. He only heard the rattling sound and went south towards the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway from Pengpu Town in Zhabei. At about 6:00, the last five white-gray light bombers to depart, two in front, also flew south along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road in Zhabei. From 6:30 to 7:00, two teams of enemy white-gray heavy bombers, three in each team, took off one after another from Yangshupu. From 8:00 to 8:30, nine more enemy planes of the above type flew out, divided into three teams. At the same time, six enemy planes had already finished bombing and flew back to the Yangshupu enemy airfield from the Shanghai West area. At 9:05, two more white-gray light bombers flew out. By 10:00, the first work of the enemy planes that had flown out above had all been completed, and three and two planes flew back one after another, while the second batch of enemy planes flew west one after another, three planes in a team, intermittently. Moreover, most of the enemy planes in Yangshupu bombed our army's positions on the south bank of the Suzhou River and various villages from Xinjing to Zhoujiaqiao in Shanghai Northwest. Therefore, there were often more than ten to twenty enemy planes flying over the Suzhou River. Fearing that our army's anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns would attack, they flew extremely high, often dropping bombs from 3,000 to 5,000 meters above the ground. The targets were not accurate, and most of them were thrown randomly in the fields and did not explode. Our army was accustomed to it and treated it calmly, so it did not cause any damage to our military. As for the enemy planes that flew from Wusong to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road area, it was not until about 11:00 that some of them were seen flying back one after another.

This morning in the Southern Shanghai area, there were enemy planes, either one or two, circling and reconnoitering every hour or so. At about 10:00, a bomb was dropped in Southern Huangpu.

Refugees from Pudong who came to Shanghai said that at 6:50 this morning, two enemy seaplanes flew low over Yangjing Town to reconnoiter. When they saw refugees walking, they used machine guns to strafe them. For a time, those who could not avoid it in time were shot and killed, including twenty to thirty women and children. Their brutal behavior was appalling. Also, enemy planes went to reconnoiter along the Pu River in Nanshi, but did not drop bombs. As for the Shanghai West area, enemy planes came and went this morning, a total of more than twenty, all bombers, wreaking havoc in Zhoujiaqiao, Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Road.

The situation in Pudong has become stable due to the consolidation of our defenses. At 6:00 last night, an enemy warship sent a motorboat to the New Mitsui Japanese Pier to spy on it. At that time, it was already dark, and two enemy soldiers landed on the shore, sneaking and groping forward, intending to inquire about military information. Our side fired shots to stop them, and the two soldiers fled in a panic and crawled into the boat. At about 8:00, two enemy warships fired artillery at Pudong, firing continuously for four or five times before stopping. At that time, two civilians, Wang Cuiqi, a married woman living in Qichang Wharf, and Jin Yangshi, a married woman in Yangjiazhai, were injured by artillery shells. Because our army did not pay attention, it soon returned to silence. This morning, enemy planes flew to the sky over Pudong in twos and threes to reconnoiter separately, and strafed down with machine guns on the east side of Xinma Road. We had no casualties.

### Another Two Thousand Enemy Reinforcements Arrive

At 7:30 this morning (the 9th), the No. 160 transport ship Ruideru Maru, which was converted from an enemy merchant ship, and two enemy ships, including the Nagazaki Maru, arrived in Shanghai one after another at about 9:00, berthed at the Huangpu Pier and the China Merchants Bureau Central Wharf, carrying more than 2,000 enemy reinforcements.

### Inspection Report Along the Shanghai-Songjiang Highway

Enemy Planes Circle and Run Rampant, Refugees Cannot Escape; Women and Children Shot by the Enemy, Hundreds of People Burned Beyond Recognition; No One Collects the Rice, and It Decays and Sprouts in the Paddy Fields

A reporter from the China East News Agency left Shanghai at 1:20 p.m. on the 8th along the Shanghai-Songjiang Highway to inspect Songjiang, and returned to Shanghai at 2:00 a.m. this morning. The order along the way was still good. However, dozens of enemy planes ran rampant along the highway, circling and bombing, and even threw incendiary bombs at the refugees, killing more than a hundred people. The situation was miserable, and those who did not witness it could not describe one in ten thousand. The details are recorded as follows:

Refugees in the Countryside Have Nowhere to Escape

Yesterday the sky was clear, and enemy planes came out to reconnoiter and run rampant. It happened that refugees from the four suburbs of Shanghai who were fleeing to Shanghai gathered along the Shanghai-Songjiang Highway and the Shanghai-Kui Road. From morning to dusk, they rubbed shoulders and came one after another, carrying the young and supporting the old, scrambling to be the first. Enemy planes ignored humanity and swept them with machine guns and threw incendiary bombs. More than a hundred refugees were torn to pieces.

The Reporter Barely Escapes

The reporter and his party were trapped on the way at 2:00 p.m. When the enemy planes saw the cars on the side of the road, they attacked back and forth, first throwing incendiary bombs. The enemy planes flew low, only fifty meters high, and then swept with machine guns. The reporter and others avoided them 100 meters away from the side of the road. The enemy planes flew low to reconnoiter and swept with machine guns five times. They flew away after 20 minutes. The reporter and others barely escaped, but a refugee child in the middle of the road was shot through his ankle.

Hiding on the Side of the Road is Still Shot to Death

It was found that after 6:00 a.m. on the 8th, three enemy planes circled the Shanghai-Songjiang Highway. The enemy planes shot those who fled along the way. Near Beiqiao, dozens of refugees were hiding on the side of the road and were still shot to death. Their bodies were also set on fire by incendiary bombs. Those who were not shot were also burned to death by incendiary bombs.

Four Young Women Die Tragically in the Car

Also, near Wujiaxiang, there was a car that was taken by people fleeing to Shanghai to take refuge. They encountered enemy planes shooting at them. Because the car was full of clothes and bedding, four women and children could not escape. The enemy planes then bombed wildly. As a result, the four women were shot and died stiff in the carriage.

The Entire Town of Songjiang Has Become a Dead City

Songjiang City was originally a prosperous area in Southern Pudong. So far, it has been ravaged by the enemy, so that the residents have all escaped since March. The town, which was densely populated, has now become a dead city. It is said that there is no one. The enemy has repeatedly thrown bombs in the city and suburbs. Songjiang City has no complete city walls.

Rice Has Ripened, But No One Collects It

The rice along the way has ripened, and many fields have already been tied up, but no one collects it, so that the rice sprouts in the fields. The scene is so miserable that it cannot be imagined in the human world.

### Japan Suddenly May Participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

The Conference Continues This Afternoon; U.S. Representative Contacts Various Countries

Brussels: According to a statement issued by a source very close to the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, Japan may participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, and it is said that Japan, in order to fulfill the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, has conducted full and frank discussions with representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and other countries in Tokyo. The statement also stated that the current conference was authorized by the League of Nations, and the Soviet Union participated. The Soviet Union is not a signatory to the treaty, so if Japan is willing to send representatives to participate in the conference, it is an important expression of Japan's spirit of reconciliation and a true concession. Furthermore, the plenary meeting at 4:00 p.m. today is not open to the public, and representatives from various countries are currently discussing the procedures of the conference. Furthermore, British Dominions Minister Malcolm MacDonald had informal talks with representatives of various Dominions last night and had considerable discussions on the current situation. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 9th)

Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which was originally scheduled to continue at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow, has now been changed to 4:00 p.m. U.S. Chief Representative Davis has been in frequent contact with representatives from various countries today. He had lunch with Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov at noon, and after the meal, he talked with the British Acting Chief Representative, namely the Minister of the British Dominions, MacDonald. Then, he went to the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and had talks with the members of the Belgian delegation. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 8th)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden recently announced in the Lower House that he will go to Brussels tomorrow to continue to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 8th)

[London] When the Lower House met this afternoon, opposition Labour Party member Flechem asked the government whether any British munitions had been exported to Japan recently. Trade Minister Stanley answered, but his wording was quite ambiguous. He said, "If the details of the licenses issued by the government for the export of domestic arms and ammunition are disclosed, it would be very inconvenient for the public interest." What can be said is that from July 1 to September 30 of this year, the value of domestic arms shipped to Japan was a total of £14.612. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 8th)

[Washington] Recently, Japanese fishing boats have been privately catching salmon in the Bristol Bay of the U.S. Alaskan Peninsula, which has greatly affected American fishermen. Regarding this matter, the State Department will negotiate with the Japanese government to request restrictions. According to experts from the State Department, after the government negotiates with Japan, it may be possible to establish a similar agreement in accordance with the four countries of the United States, Japan, Russia, and Canada along the Arctic Ocean to restrict the capture of seals. (Uvas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 8th)

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden replied to a question from Conservative Party member Adams in the Lower House today and made a brief statement on the current situation of the Brussels Conference. Eden said that Japan's reply to the invitation of the General Assembly to send representatives to exchange views with a small number of countries in the Nine-Power Treaty organization did not stipulate a time limit, and the organization of a small number of countries is still under discussion at the meeting. Eden also said that he plans to go to Beijing on Tuesday to continue to participate in the work of the conference. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 8th)

### Cai Jinjun Issues a Statement

According to the Central News Agency, Police Chief Cai Jinjun has been ordered to defend Nanshi, has supervised his subordinates, resisted desperately, and is determined to protect this last piece of land in Shanghai and coexist with the entire Shanghai. He told the reporter that the Nanshi defense has not been affected by our army's adjustment of the front line and the retreat to the southwest. The Nanshi defense was extremely solid a month ago, and the various rumors are absolutely untrue. Although the police force is relatively weak, it is our duty to defend the people and defend the city. Since the Shanghai War of Resistance, the entire bureau has been mobilized. In addition to working hard to maintain law and order and providing relief to refugees, it has also coordinated with the National Army in various battles in the city center and has repeatedly established glorious military achievements. Now the National Army has temporarily moved west due to strategic considerations. It is the duty of this bureau to follow the instructions of the leader and the government and to firmly defend Nanshi from behind the National Army. Even if there is only one gun and one bullet left, we will fight to the end and never easily allow the enemy to completely occupy Shanghai, so as to fight for the country's personality and the nation's honor. I am a soldier and can only repay the country with death. Please convey this intention to the people of the country. As for the officials and police of this bureau, they all deeply understand the magnitude of the crisis and will surely go to the disaster with a sigh.

### Short Commentary

— Xiang

This Shanghai battle was first lost in the grand battlefield and then lost in Jinshanwei, which greatly changed the Shanghai war situation. The enemy can scatter in all directions to Southern Pudong. One way is from Tinglin Yexie Zhangze to Mishidu and Chuanlaimiao, etc., one way is from Langxia Xincang Xinjie to Shihudang, and one way is from Quan Gong Ting Xingxing Town to Zhapu Pinghu. Not only Songjiang and Qingpu are threatened, but also Zhejiang is shaken and uneasy. Now our military authorities should strictly guard the predetermined national defense line, reorganize the layout, and launch a swift counterattack to reverse the decline and restore the lost land. That is what we hope.

### On the Way to the Front Lines (3) (Continued)

— Special Correspondent Communications Officer Shi Heng from the Central News Agency

I'll tell you, wasn't the old Grand Canal breached by us? The Japanese soldiers transported many small motorboats and rubber boats. Once, the Japanese soldiers hid in the motorboats and forced the common people to stand on top, trying to sneak into our positions. Just imagine, the boats were full of our common people, women, and children. Our soldiers, seeing this, naturally didn't want to shoot. But after discussing it, they had someone dive into the water and swim to our side to report. When the boats were about to pass, our guards opened fire. As a result, none of our common people or the Japanese soldiers in the boats survived. The common people were willing to die together.

Listening to such war anecdotes under a large tree in the wilderness is heart-stirring. Looking up at the distance, it's as if that tragic and heroic picture is reflected right before your eyes. This is definitely not a fabricated story. I dare to guarantee these words, spoken from the mouth of a rural villager in his forties who hasn't received any education. China will definitely not perish, I dare to further guarantee.

A traveler, who had no idea where he gathered his hearsay and believed it to be true, spoke of the fall of Cangzhou.

"What battle was fought in Cangzhou? The XXX army sent there usually made a fuss about wanting to go back home. But this time they didn't dare to go up to take over the defense until two days later when the Japanese army discovered the truth and occupied Cangzhou."

"Is that right?" I asked the peanut-selling refugee.

"That's not right," he said, hunching over, fiddling with the peanuts in his basket. He didn't want to refute the traveler's words, yet couldn't help but retort, smiling and slowly saying, "Cangzhou fell because of traitors. Two days before Cangzhou fell, there was indeed an incident because the change of guard lost Yao Guantun. But it wasn't intentional not to take over the defense. After retreating from Yao Guantun, they defended the XXX Temple, which was just over five li north of Cangzhou. That day, there was fighting on the front lines, and alarms went off in the city. The common people were fleeing in chaos. Gunfire started from inside the city, followed by gunfire outside the south gate. Plus, with the bombing from airplanes and artillery, do you think the front lines could hold? That's how Cangzhou was lost."

The situation of the fall of Cangzhou as described by this refugee is generally correct and doesn't differ much from the news the reporter heard from more reliable sources. There were three main reasons for the failure of the Cangzhou battle: 1. The coordination of the troops was not good. There was little communication between the armies, so they suffered losses during the changing of the guard. There were also inevitable personnel conflicts. 2. The ill-advised breaching of the Grand Canal. After the breaching, the enemy transported various boats from the rear and installed machine guns on them to rush forward, while balloons in the sky served as indicators. Our army was unprepared. Soldiers initially climbed trees to fight, but later could only use wooden planks. 3. The sabotage by traitors in the rear.

Like all other farmers, this honest farmer cannot forget his hometown, his fields. How he yearns to be able to return to his hometown soon and resume a peaceful and prosperous farming life!

"Sir, are we going to fight back soon?"

"It will be soon. Your land will definitely still belong to you," I couldn't help but comfort him by saying this.

Alas, sighing, "I didn't bring anything out with me, just an empty person. It's getting cold soon, and the people at home don't have any clothes to wear."

"How are you living now?"

"The government rations us food, but it's not enough to live on. We sell some peanuts to supplement it."

"After the air raid alert was lifted, there were two or three more false alarms. We ran back and forth four times from Jiehe Station to the village where we took refuge. It wasn't until after noon that we finally got on the train. It turned out our guess was right. The bomb that exploded with a loud bang in our ears did indeed land not far from where the train was stopped. The train was full of shattered glass from the bombed-out windows. Some of the train doors were even blown off. Holes pierced by shrapnel were visible everywhere on the train. The porter was sweeping up, repairing windows and doors, and tidying up the vehicles after the disaster. Perhaps because they were used to it, people were talking and laughing as if nothing happened, not thinking about the dangers of the journey.

Towards evening, the train arrived at Taian Station. The area around the station had also suffered several catastrophes and was in terrible shape. After passing Taian, the train proceeded into the mountains, which was the Taishan mountain range. Taishan, as seen in the dim light, was even more extraordinarily majestic. Great and magnificent Taishan, which enjoys a worldwide reputation and has been revered by the Chinese people for thousands of years, will you bear to see this great land change masters? Even if only for you, shouldn't we shed our last drop of blood and bravely kill the enemy? (October 30th from Jinan) (To be continued)

### Headquarters Strictly Investigates and Prosecutes Unscrupulous Merchants, Who Are Terrified

Workers in Various Industries Prepare to Report

Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, this city has strictly implemented economic sanctions against Japan. Unscrupulous merchants who imported Japanese goods have suddenly become panicked, either disguising themselves and transporting goods to other ports for dumping, or using false pretenses to peddle goods to their peers and retail stores. Since the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters transferred the cases of Xie Keming of Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Li Aidong of Mitsubishi Trading Company, and Chen Chunong of Tonghe Public Customs Broker to the court for investigation and prosecution, the people have been greatly relieved, especially the enthusiastic staff in the stores. It is heard that Yin and Long, etc., who run Japanese goods in the dried goods industry, have also been greatly frightened recently, temporarily lying low. Meanwhile, the Anti-Japanese Economic Sanctions Promotion Association of the Dried Goods Industry, organized by the industry's workers, is investigating the facts and preparing to report.

### Chamber of Commerce Writes to Police Bureau to Protect Merchants' Goods

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the city's Police Bureau stating that Xincheng Charcoal Company sent personnel to hire vehicles at the South Wharf to transport coal. They were stopped by a police officer surnamed Xu at the junction of Xinqiao, who also marked "void" on the Chamber of Commerce certificate. This is a violation of the Commander-in-Chief's frugal telegram and the purpose of allowing ordinary merchant goods to be transported upon presentation of a Chamber of Commerce certificate. It specifically requests the Police Bureau to order its subordinates to strictly admonish them and not to arbitrarily suppress or detain goods again.

### Estimated Damage to Factories in Shanghai

Over Two Thousand Factories Destroyed - Losses of 500 Million Yuan

The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, upon receiving a telegram from the Ministry of Industry, stated that for all domestic factories in various locations that have been destroyed by the enemy since the start of the war of resistance, the location of the factories, the date of destruction, and the estimated losses should be investigated and telegraphed back within three days of the telegram's arrival. In addition to announcing to all factory owners to comply with the various items opened in the ministry telegram and report to the bureau, the bureau also submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry yesterday regarding the situation of factories destroyed in this city. According to reporters, the estimated number of factories is about 2,000, with total losses of about 500 million yuan. The above estimate considers factories in war zones such as Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Yiru, etc., as completely destroyed.

### Second Batch of Registered National Salvation Organizations

The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association previously handled the registration of anti-enemy and national salvation organizations according to the Unified Anti-Enemy and National Salvation Organization Method. The first batch of organizations that were approved and disapproved for registration by the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau have been published in various newspapers. Now, the second batch of organizations applying for registration has also been reviewed by the association and forwarded to the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau for review. Those approved for registration include the National Salvation Corps, the Hu Nan Youth National Salvation Corps, the Mass National Salvation Speech Corps, the Chinese Youth Anti-Enemy National Salvation Corps, the Chinese Youth Wartime Service Corps, the Shanghai Vocational Youth Wartime Service Corps, the Youth Architectural Circle Wartime Service Corps, the Shanghai Wartime Popular Education Service Corps, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Circle National Salvation Association, the Tai Jiabao Refugee Relief Association, the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association Wartime Knowledge Lecture Hall Student National Salvation Work Corps, and the Shanghai Primary School Education Advancement Association Wartime Service Corps, totaling eleven organizations. Those not approved include the Family Women Wartime Service Corps, the Chinese Film National Salvation Association, the Shanghai Education Circle Travel Propaganda Corps, the All-People Anti-Japanese Volunteer Service Corps, the Popular Science Society Wartime Service Corps, the Guangdong and Guangxi Students Staying in Shanghai Anti-Japanese Support Association, and the Hot-Blooded National Salvation Propaganda Corps, totaling seven organizations. In addition, the Shanghai University of Commerce Wartime Service Corps and the August 13th Wartime Service Corps, etc., have all withdrawn their registration.

### Various Grain Organizations Regulate the Food Supply for Shanghai Residents

Concession Authorities Purchase Large Quantities of Foreign Rice

After the Shanghai Food Regulation Committee announced its closure, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to supervise various grain organizations in handling the regulation of the Shanghai food supply. Now, various grain organizations, such as the Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Industry Association, and the Rice Shop Industry Association, etc., are not only finding ways to purchase rice from various rice-producing areas but are also striving to stabilize rice prices. Although the current rice reserves in Shanghai are lower than before, there is a large stock of wheat flour, so there is no shortage of food for Shanghai residents. At the same time, the concession authorities have purchased Saigon rice and other types from abroad to transport to Shanghai to regulate the food supply. Currently, the market price of rice is 14 yuan for the top grade and 13 yuan and 6 jiao for the second grade.

### Relief Association's Sanitation Team Organizes a Lice Extermination Team for Refugees

The Shanghai Branch of the Emergency Period Refugee Relief Committee's Sanitation Team has recently noted that refugees in various shelters often do not change their clothes, leading to the breeding of fleas and lice. They fear that if extermination is not carried out in a timely manner, it will spread to all the refugees, seriously affecting their health. In addition to notifying the administrators of various shelters to supervise the refugees to change their clothes at any time, the team has also organized a large refugee lice extermination team. Team members take turns going to various shelters every day to spray the clothes of refugees with lice with medicine and iron them flat. If there are head lice, they are ordered to shave their heads and then wash them with medicine to carry out extermination work, just like frontline soldiers eradicating the evil Japanese bandits.

### Charity Federation Establishes a Strong Laborer Shelter

Providing Substantial Training - Assigning Services Everywhere

The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, recognizing that there are many strong and healthy men among the refugees they have sheltered, believes that if they are allowed to live idly and eat without working, developing laziness, it will not only cause difficulties in providing for them but also cause great losses to the country, society, and themselves. In addition to finding suitable work to earn a living on their behalf, they have established a shelter specifically for strong laborers on Daxilu, providing substantial training to make them useful materials. Yesterday, they specifically notified various shelters to register strong laborers: (1) Those aged 18 to 40, (2) Those with strong physiques and no diseases, (3) Those with detailed family addresses and clear backgrounds, (4) Those who voluntarily register. The training period is about three months, after which they will be assigned to various services. The treatment is 7 yuan per month, and clothing will be issued by the public.

### New Pharmaceutical Industry's Wounded Soldier Hospital Begins Sheltering Wounded Soldiers

Yesterday Sent a Letter to the International Red Cross for a Standard Number

### What is the Axis of Mass Organization?

— Guo Woli

Theoretical exploration and practical experience reveal that to ensure victory against the enemy, we must quickly mobilize the vast power of the masses. Without this basic force, it is difficult to have absolute certainty of victory in resisting the enemy.

At the current stage, the strength of the war of resistance is limited to military strength, with little mass participation, and has not yet realized the integration of the military and the people to become a complete force for war of resistance. In Mr. Li Gongpu's report on his inspection of the northern front, and in his conversation with General Li Zongren after his inspection of the Shanghai front, it was proven that the masses did not have organized strength to assist in the military's war of resistance; at the same time, the military urgently needed the strength of mass organizations to help.

The call to organize and train the masses has resonated throughout the skies since the outbreak of the Shanghai war. But in reality, the power of the masses that has supplemented the work of resisting the war is still like "phoenix feathers and unicorn horns."

The military and the people should "strengthen the walls and clear the fields." This is the story of the German army expelling all the French people in the area outside the defense line after invading France during the European War in order to strengthen the rear. Now the enemy needs this trick against us, but we have already been invaded by the enemy, so it is even more urgent for the entire population to participate, and then we can create our strong front to deal with the enemy's invasion.

"Only when the government and the people are united can great strength be generated," General Li's words are indeed a needle in the right place, a targeted remedy. In the vast guerrilla warfare in northern Shanxi, the power of mass organizations is even more urgently needed in order to obtain unexpected gains, severely strike the enemy, and make them exhausted. With mass organizations, in addition to directly cooperating in killing the enemy, they can also help the army build public works and transport supplies. Indirectly, they can rescue affected refugees, preside over donations, and provide慰勞 duties; especially clearing out traitors and consolidating the rear. The two are connected and support each other, avoiding worrying about one thing and losing sight of another, panicking, and working together in the same boat, not fearing the stormy seas, so as not to capsize.

The theory of mass organization and the plan to organize the masses, high-level arguments, are all visible. What I want to say now is the "axis problem" in mass organization.

The elements of the masses include men, women, old, and young. A broad mass organization contains these four kinds of elements. Judging from the conditions of "strength and vigor" and "youthful spirit," only youth possess them. Moreover, youth are the largest majority, and the most urgently needed is youth. Only youth can undertake practical combat and all arduous work, so youth is the "axis" in mass organization.

The youth movement in the Northern Expedition era made the greatest efforts for the revolutionary project. As long as we take national interests as the premise, take the restoration of lost land as our duty, believe in the leader, support the government, strengthen the organization, take active action, and never be timid, be careful of slackening. The national crisis is imminent, so hurry up, work hard, work hard, and work practically, then everything will be over.

Now that we understand our own position and responsibility, to push the wheels of this huge mass organization, on a distant long journey, it is by no means a task that can be completed casually.

Among the youth, the responsibility and expectations of the educated youth are very deep! In this high tide of mass organization, we should expand and strengthen the original organization, improve the tools themselves among the various elements, and contribute all our energy and expertise to practical work, to be the backbone of the broad mass movement, to enrich the internal body and military affairs of the mass organization, to cooperate with the front line of the war of resistance, to excavate new strength, and to eliminate the enemy's aggression.
