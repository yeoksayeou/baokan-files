### Chaotic Situation in Shaanxi and Gansu Still Awaiting Political Resolution

Many Officers and Soldiers Under Yang Hucheng Are Reddened; Mao Zedong's Troops Have Reached Changwu; Northeastern Army Deploys Defenses Around Chishui; Yang Now Commands Military Affairs in Lintong

[Zhengzhou] The situation in Shaanxi and Gansu is chaotic. Most of the Red bandits are gathered in Pingliang, Yichuan, Yijun, Sanyuan, and other places, about a day's journey from Xi'an. Zhang and Yang's troops are currently disintegrating, but there is no clear demarcation between those allied with the Communists and those against them. There have been skirmishes along the Haihe River for days. The National Army defending Huaxian has not advanced and is still awaiting a political resolution. (13th Dispatch)

[Xuzhou] According to railway news, traffic on the Tongxi section is interrupted, and highway buses are also suspended. The Northeastern Army is actively deploying defenses around Chishui, currently laying landmines and taking hostile actions against the Central Army. The situation is exceptionally serious, and war is on the verge of breaking out. The Central Army is only taking defensive measures, still hoping for Yang Hucheng and the Northeastern Army generals to awaken early. Therefore, they are still handling the situation peacefully and have learned that Yang Hucheng invited a petition group to Tongguan to meet with Fan Songfu, requesting a cessation of military action. Fan told the representatives to return and persuade Yang to quickly accept the Central Government's orders and leave Xi'an promptly. It is reported that Yang is still unlikely to comply and has gone to Lintong to command military affairs. His defense plan involves the Northeastern Army guarding the east-west routes, with Yang's troops responsible for the city's defenses. Yang remains the temporary commander-in-chief. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Beiping] According to a foreign resident who came to Beiping from Xi'an, the young officers and most of the soldiers under Yang Hucheng have been thoroughly reddened. Now, Xi'an, Sanyuan, Lin'gao, and other places are almost bandit areas, and the people are extremely frightened. Property owners have all fled, and foreign residents and missionaries in Shaanxi are also leaving one after another. Sun Weiru's troops are rushing to build defensive fortifications in Xi'an, Sanyuan, Chunhua, Gaoling, Fuping, and other areas. Sun Weiru's troops in Weibei Jiaokou and other places are frequently clashing with Feng Qinzai's troops, and it is predicted that war will be difficult to avoid. It is rumored that the Red bandits who infiltrated Shaanxi this time entered Changwu and other places on the Shaanxi border via Pingliang and Jingchuan on the Longxi border. The bandit vanguard is composed of Xu Xiangqian and Mao Zedong's forces, numbering about six or seven thousand, with ample weapons. It is rumored to be Xu and Mao's elite infantry. It is heard that Xu and Mao are also personally commanding the bandits. There are reports that the bandits' fake headquarters is located in Changwu. Currently, Xi'an, Lintong, and Sanyuan are covered with all kinds of slogans posted by the Red bandit propaganda organs, everywhere one looks. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Tongguan: The Tongguan Garrison Headquarters has been established and is operational from today. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] News from the capital about the situation in Xi'an is unclear. It is reported that Yang Hucheng is still in Lintong, and the Xi'an military headquarters is still inside the city. The Northeastern Army and Yang Hucheng seem to be acting independently. Many stable elements in the Northeastern Army are unwilling to collude. Those stationed on the front lines are defending themselves, and those in the rear are gathering strength for self-defense. Yang Hucheng's orders are not followed by the Northeastern Army, and the so-called orders of the Northeastern Army staff group are also not implemented by their subordinates. Yang Hucheng, fearing Sun Weiru's instability, has completely coerced the families of Sun's troops to a village 90 li from Xi'an in Sanyuan, guarded by Yang's confidants. Newly arrived Red bandits are stationed around, essentially holding the families hostage to force compliance. Yang himself is mentally disturbed and acts erratically. (13th Dispatch)

[Nanjing] According to a certain news agency, Yang Hucheng's stored ammunition in Xi'an was completely transported to northern Shaanxi after being deceived by the Red bandits. Furthermore, some leather clothing was also taken away by the Red bandits through deception. Currently, male and female political workers from the Red bandits' fake political department have arrived at Chong'en Temple, five miles from Xi'an, and established a fake political department, led by Zhou Enlai. (13th Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The danger of the Central Army and the mutinous soldiers immediately starting a war is now considered avoidable. At the same time, a telegram from Luoyang denies that 70 foreigners have been captured from Xi'an and brought to Luoyang, but the general public's concern about the safety of foreigners in Xi'an seems to have decreased significantly. British military attache Lieutenant Colonel Faileisai and American military attache Captain Bali Te came to Luoyang together last Thursday to plan the evacuation of British and American residents from Xi'an. It is reported that they have now obtained guarantees from the Luoyang military authorities that all foreigners residing in Xi'an will be given safe passage to escape the dangerous situation. It is also reported that Yang Hucheng is also trying to get foreigners to leave Xi'an, roughly allowing them to travel by long-distance bus from Xi'an to Tongguan, and then transfer to the Longhai Railway to Luoyang. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

[Beiping] The following is according to foreign residents from Xi'an: The officers and soldiers of Yang Hucheng's troops in Xi'an have all been reddened. Xi'an, Lintong, Sanyuan, and other places have been occupied by the Communist army. Property owners have gradually begun to seek refuge, and all foreigners have had to evacuate. Yang's Sun Weiru's troops are now gathered in the Xi'an, Zunhua, and Sanyuan areas, actively deploying defensive works. Sun's troops in Weibei are currently engaged in combat with Feng Qinzai's troops advancing west. The Communist armies of Mao Zedong and Xu Xiangqian, numbering about six or seven thousand, have arrived near Changwu from Pingliang and Jingchuan. Their headquarters is located in Changwu. Xu and Mao are personally in command, and their weapons are quite excellent. Xi'an, Lintong, Sanyuan, and other places have become the Communist army's stage of activity. All the transportation agencies there have been taken over by the Communist bandits, and slogans and books are posted everywhere. (13th Allied Dispatch)

[Beiping] Liu Zhe and Mo Dehui previously went to Beijing upon the invitation of He Yingqin via telegram to discuss the aftermath of the Northwest. Recently, Liu and Mo telegraphed to their families in Beiping, saying that the results were very good. Jiang's original intention of peace has a foolproof plan for the situation in Shaanxi. (13th Dispatch)

[Luoyang] According to sources in the transportation sector, passenger cars are currently operating between Xi'an and Weinan, but inspections are very strict. Passengers traveling back and forth must undergo at least a dozen interrogations and feel extremely distressed. (13th Central Agency Dispatch)

### Ma Zhanshan Remains in Xi'an

[Nanjing] Ma Zhanshan entered Shaanxi last month. When Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned to the capital, Ma rushed to the Xi'an airport, intending to fly to the capital with him. However, Yang Hucheng caught sight of him at the airport and insisted that he stay in Shaanxi to participate in military affairs. Ma is currently still in Xi'an, and it is difficult to say when he will leave Shaanxi. (13th Dispatch)

### Eurasia Plane Flies to Luoyang to Transport Foreign Residents

[Nanjing] Foreign residents in the Shaanxi-Gansu area have been advised by various countries' embassies in China to withdraw. The British have also sent a military attache to Luoyang to handle this matter specifically. Due to transportation disruptions, airplanes must be used to be effective. The embassies are currently processing these handover procedures. Two Eurasia chartered planes flew to Luoyang on the 13th, awaiting news from Xi'an to fly to the battle zone. (13th Dispatch)

[Beiping] More than seventy foreign residents from Britain, America, Germany, France, and Belgium residing in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces arrived in Luoyang on the 12th after passing through Tongguan and departed for Beiping, Shanghai, and other places. There are still more than one hundred foreign residents in Shaanxi and Gansu who will withdraw from the province after transportation is restored. (13th Allied Dispatch)

[Beiping] Yesterday, a government plane departed from Beiping and flew to Xi'an to transport a small group of British residents back here. If successful, all foreign residents in the area will be gradually transported out by plane. Therefore, everyone is eagerly awaiting news of the plane's return. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

### Gao Guizi and Gao Shuangcheng Support the Central Government

[Nanjing] Military news: After the Shaanxi Incident, Shaanxi generals issued preposterous telegrams, forcibly listing the titles of division commanders Gao Guizi and Gao Shuangcheng. Yesterday, the two division commanders telegraphed (11th) a report to the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Military Affairs, stating that they were astonished to see their names listed in the Shaanxi telegram. They only knew to support the Central Government and obey the orders of the Chairman, and were not involved in anything else. They respectfully reported this, etc. It is heard that Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs has already replied by telegram, expressing his appreciation for the division commanders' spirit of loyalty to the country.

### Yamamoto Visited Jiang Zuobin Yesterday

Seeking to Salvage Sino-Japanese Relations

[Nanjing] Yamamoto Jitsuhiko visited Jiang Zuobin at the Ministry of Interior at 2:30 PM on the 13th. It was decided that he would go to Zhenjiang tomorrow morning to visit Chen Guofu. After returning to Shanghai, Yamamoto, while in Japan, often criticized his country's authorities from a liberal standpoint. He told reporters on the 13th that his purpose in coming to China this time was twofold: first, to express condolences to Mr. Jiang and offer congratulations in person; second, to examine, from a national standpoint, whether there is a way to salvage the perilous relationship between China and Japan today. Since coming to Beijing via Shanghai, he has met with no fewer than dozens of prominent Chinese and Japanese figures. The results of the talks have generally been disappointing. He also deeply feels that temporary patching-up measures based on ambition will never yield good results. The wisdom of the authorities seems to have reached a stage of exhaustion, and the atmosphere of resorting to final measures is intensifying day by day. If this continues, there is a great fear that both countries will perish together. For the sake of maintaining the excellent Eastern culture of thousands of years and for the future happiness of the descendants of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, how can we stand idly by in the face of this disaster? Upon his return to his country this time, he will convey the views of Chinese intellectuals to Japanese intellectuals and engage in a conscientious effort to salvage the catastrophe in East Asia.

### Miscellaneous News from Europe

— Our European Correspondent, Lie Shan

㊉㊃ Racial Issues

The German National Socialist Party divides the world's humans into two types: Aryans and non-Aryans. Aryans are white people, the creators of world culture. (See Hitler's book, Mein Kampf.) Races other than white are non-Aryans, fundamentally inferior races. This has caused some disputes. For example, the Japanese have protested, saying that this classification is an insult to Japan. It is said that, as a result, Germany recognized the Japanese as an exception, entitled to Aryan treatment. Secondly, Hungarians, Finns, and other nationalities are also of Mongol origin, but because they have lived in Europe for a long time, they are considered quasi-Aryans. As for Chinese people marrying Germans, although there has been no explicit law prohibiting it in recent years, it is said that, at one time, marriage permits could not be obtained. However, in the past year, it seems that Chinese people have also received this preferential treatment. The reason is that several Chinese students have married German girls.

About last year, I visited a certain important figure in the National Socialist Party who was in charge of racial policy, and we talked about racial issues. He told me that the purity of bloodlines is very important for the survival of a nation, and that mixed marriages can gradually degrade the nation. I said that we feel the same way, and the Chinese government also prohibits diplomatic officials and soldiers from marrying foreign women, but our reasons are political, not racial.

He said that many foreign newspapers often misunderstand Germany's racial issues. In fact, they do not look down on other races; they only advocate that there should be no mixed marriages, and that, in principle, all races are equal. He asked what Chinese public opinion had to say about Germany's racial issues. I said that the number of Chinese people marrying Germans is limited; it is only a small number of Chinese students in Germany who marry German wives, and only a smaller number of German businessmen who marry Chinese wives. So racial issues are not of great concern to us. As for the views of various countries in the Far East on racial issues, they vary. For example, some people feel that since Germans advocate racial issues and say that the German race is so excellent, then Germans should stay in Germany and not go to other countries. Of course, the views of this group of people are somewhat extreme...

Then he quickly shifted the topic to the Jewish question.

㊉㊄ More on Racial Issues

About two years ago, I was hiking alone in the mountains of southern Germany, and I stopped to rest at a tavern because I was tired of running halfway. At that time, there was an S.S. captain from the National Socialist Party (the S.S. (Schutzstaffel) is the armed organization of the National Socialist Party, and its task is equivalent to the party's police) sitting at the next table. Because I was a foreigner, I attracted his attention, and because I happened to have a new suit and a pair of new hiking shoes, he did not recognize me as a Qingtian peddler. He began to ask me if I was studying in Germany. I said, "Almost." He asked, "Studying medicine?" I replied, "Um!" So we started chatting.

He asked, "Do you like Germany?"

I replied, "German people are very friendly, and I especially like southern German beer!"

He asked, "What is your impression of the 'Third Reich'?"

I replied, "Your national defense forces have made rapid progress in recent years!"

We then talked about German National Socialism.

He asked, "What are your views on racial issues?"

I replied, "In the eyes of us Chinese, this is a very appropriate approach, especially for Chinese people traveling in Germany."

He asked, "Why?"

I replied, "Isn't it so? We know that the target of racial issues is the Jews. Although we Chinese are not Jews, we are certainly not Aryans. To avoid trouble, we have not even dated girlfriends in Germany in recent years."

He asked, "But—"

I replied, "This makes things a lot easier. You know, we bring money to Germany to spend. In addition to studying, we inevitably need entertainment, that is, dance halls, cafes, theaters, etc. How much money would it cost to take a girlfriend to such places? Since your country promoted racial issues, Chinese students often go to libraries, museums, or stay at home and study behind closed doors."

He…

I said, "Racial issues are only good for us. Isn't it so? We can save a lot of money and a lot of time!"

Current Commentary

### Thoughts on the Shaanxi-Gansu Problem

— Starting Point

Recently, the psychology of the people throughout the country is tense again. Everyone is gradually realizing the feeling they had before December 25th of last year when Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had not yet left Xi'an. The reason need not be concealed. It is because the aftermath of the Xi'an Incident has not only not subsided, but new difficulties are growing. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has already returned safely. Zhang Xueliang has already followed him to the capital to await punishment. It seemed that the state of unrest in the Shaanxi-Gansu area should have disappeared along with this. Unexpectedly, this state continues. In particular, it continues after the central government has already promulgated measures to deal with the aftermath. This is something that makes us feel extremely apprehensive and worried.

From the central government's measures to deal with the aftermath of the Xi'an Incident, we can see the great pains taken by the central government. And this painstaking effort is in line with the wishes in the hearts of the people throughout the country. Therefore, it is extremely supported by the people throughout the country. We believe that the central government's painstaking efforts, precisely because they are in line with the wishes of the people throughout the country and are supported by the people throughout the country, will surely achieve final victory. Looking at events a little further back, such as the Liangguang Incident last year, and looking at events more recently, such as Zhang Xueliang's repentance and following Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to Beijing, both are sufficient to prove that the central government's painstaking efforts to take care of the overall situation and its sincerity in loving the country can resolve any difficulties and overcome even the most stubborn people.

History tells us that only when a person's words and deeds are in line with the wishes of the majority can he achieve something. Otherwise, he will isolate himself from others and destroy his own history. Such a person, even if he can claim strength for a time, will inevitably follow the path to failure in the end. As for the wishes of all of us now, they are undoubtedly to unify our steps and concentrate our strength to accomplish our mission of resisting the enemy, defending against humiliation, and liberating the nation. Anyone who undermines the unity of our steps or weakens the concentration of our strength is a traitor to our country and will be forever abandoned by the people. Especially at a time when the national situation is as precarious as a pile of eggs and the enemy is waiting for an opportunity to make a move, if anyone slightly indulges in emotions and disregards the will of the people throughout the country, then his sins will inevitably lead to an irredeemable situation. General Fu Zuoyi, who is on the front line of national defense, recently said in his published announcement: "Only when the people throughout the country as a whole bring into play their spirit and strength of unity can they make the other side reassess and know what to be wary of." Yes. If one violates the highest principle of bringing into play the spirit and strength of unity as a whole, then one is providing the enemy with materials for calculating against us. Not only that, but one is also helping the enemy calculate against one's own country and nation.

### Soviet Central Executive Committee Approves New Budget

Income and Expenditure Offset, Still a Surplus

[Moscow] The Third Plenary Session of the Soviet Central Executive Committee discussed the 1937 budget today and unanimously approved it. The total revenue is 98,690,500,000 rubles, and the total expenditure is 97,119,500,000 rubles, resulting in a surplus of 1,571,000,000 rubles. (12th Havas Dispatch)

[Moscow] According to Grinko's report at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Soviet Central Executive Committee, the investment budget for the national economy this year is over 39 billion rubles, including capital construction investment, increased national defense expenditures, and education and health expenditures. In 1936, the education expenditure was 13.9 billion rubles, and this year it is estimated to be 18.5 billion rubles. The increase in education expenditure is in line with the Stalinist Constitution's guarantee of the right to education in the Soviet Union. Health expenditure last year was 5.8 billion rubles, and this year it has increased to 7.5 billion rubles, a large part of which will be for the protection of mothers and infants, totaling 125.5 million rubles, compared to 78.9 million rubles last year, an increase of 59%. This year, the budget expenditure of various republics and localities has increased by 17.3% compared to last year, from 24,171.2 million rubles to 28,340 million rubles. In discussing the estimated budget revenue for 1937, Ge Lin noted that when the government prepared the national budget for 1936, it was recognized that the total profit of state-owned enterprises and economic organizations would be 11.3 billion rubles, but in fact the profit reached 14.5 billion rubles last year. In 1937, the total profit of these enterprises will reach 20.8 billion rubles.

The estimated profit for each industrial sector this year is as follows: The profit of heavy industry will reach 4.2 billion rubles, an increase of over 29% compared to last year. The profit of the food industry is expected to be 3.3 billion rubles, an increase of 35%. The profit of railway transportation has increased dramatically. According to the railway committee's transportation plan, due to the increased labor productivity of railway workers and the reduced transportation costs, the profit this year will reach 1.4 billion rubles, an increase of 80% compared to last year. The profit of business trade will increase by 66.3% due to the planned increase in trade revenue and the reduction in trade costs, reaching 1.2 billion rubles this year. For the same reason, the profit of each consumer cooperative will increase from 688 million rubles last year to 1,125 million rubles.

Ge Lin also pointed out that the estimated increase in industrial and agricultural production in 1937 will be reflected in the sharp increase in trade revenue and the large-scale development of trade between urban and rural areas. The total trade revenue of state-owned and cooperative organizations this year will reach 131 billion rubles, an increase of 23.6% compared to 1936. (12th TASS Dispatch)

### Roosevelt Requests Congressional Authorization to Reorganize Government

Increase Social Welfare and Construction Departments, Save Expenses and Increase Efficiency

[Washington] President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress today, requesting full authority to reorganize various agencies of the Federal Government. The message contains five points. If passed, the President's executive power will open a new era in American history. The content is briefly described as follows:

㊀ Establish a Department of Social Welfare and a Department of Construction, expanding the Cabinet to twelve departments. The government's current jurisdiction over one hundred agencies, such as various committees and administrations, will be divided among the twelve departments.

㊁ Establish an "Administrative Office" of six people under the President to enable the President to focus on his duties. The Presidential Secretariat will remain unchanged. The President's eldest son, James, will be a liaison officer between the Presidential Palace and Congress.

㊂ The Budget Bureau will be changed to an agency directly under the President, and its powers will be expanded to include the central government's intelligence agencies, preside over government research work, draft and promulgate presidential orders, and study various bills, in order to adjust various federal government affairs in addition to budget preparation.

㊃ Government officials, except for senior officials who plan policies, will all be subject to the civil service system. The existing Civil Service Commission will be abolished, and the President will appoint a Civil Service Administration. The appointment and promotion of civil servants will be based on merit and seniority. The Administration will also set up seven honorary consultants, whose candidates must be approved by the Senate and will not be paid.

㊄ Abolish the Director of the Audit Bureau and establish an Accounting Bureau, which may report "illegal and wasteful expenditures" to Congress, but has nothing to do with government administration. The Department of Finance will also add an Accounting Office, which will be managed by the Director of the Accounting Bureau. The President's plan is based on the report of the Government Reorganization Committee. The three members of the committee are the Director of the Government Agency Adjustment Office, Professor Merlin of the University of Chicago in Political Science, and Gulick, the executive director of the Administrative Society. Observers believe that some aspects of Congress may maintain firm opposition to this plan, but the committee has long stated that it will not harm the legislative power of Congress, and only suggests that Congress also establish four committees for finance, budget, personnel, and design, so that it can be in line with the work of the reorganized government. The President also spoke to the press today, saying that the greatest purpose of the reorganization plan is to improve administrative efficiency and concentrate the President's responsibilities and powers, and secondly to save expenses. The President does not expect the fundamental organization of the Federal Government to change once and for all, and it will take two or three years to be fully operational. It is expected that the amount of expenses saved will be very limited, but there is no intention to infringe on the powers of Congress. As for territorial affairs, the message does not suggest the establishment of a special department, because the President has the power to change the administrative organization of overseas territories as appropriate. A spokesperson for the Government Reorganization Committee said that the committee did not propose any method of controlling the agencies under the jurisdiction of various government departments. (National Telegram on the 12th)

### Trotsky's Declaration: Non-Interference in Mexican Internal Affairs

Striving to Avoid Harming Mexican-American Diplomatic Relations, the Mexican Communist Party Holds Large-Scale Demonstrations

Mexico City. Since arriving here, Trotsky, the leader of the anti-cadre faction of the Soviet Communist Party, has been staying at the home of the writer Rivera (leader of the Mexican Trotskyist faction). He recently gave a speech to the press, saying that he will never interfere in Mexican internal affairs and will avoid any actions that may harm Mexico's diplomatic relations with the United States. Trotsky was unwilling to express any opinion on the results of the US election in November last year, the victory of the Democratic Party, and the policies pursued by President Roosevelt. When asked whether he believed that the communism he advocated was sufficient to solve various social problems, he replied, "Lenin and I both believe that other countries do not need to follow the path taken by the Soviet Union to carry out social revolution, because the Soviet Union has its own political characteristics, and its foundation is different from other countries. However, I firmly believe that we have achieved something in promoting human happiness." Father said, "The Soviet government accuses me of colluding with fascism and endangering the motherland. Anyone with a little wisdom will never easily believe this rumor, because there is no room for compromise between me and fascism. I believe that the victory of German National Socialism was promoted by the poor policies adopted by the Third International." Finally, he said that the Mexican government's generous treatment of him was unexpected. (Havas Telegram on the 12th)

Mexico City. The Mexican Communist Party issued a statement today, criticizing Trotsky, saying that although Trotsky had made promises, declaring that he would never engage in political activities in Mexico, he has now gone back on his word. The residence of the painter Rivera (where Trotsky is staying) will become a center for agitating and alienating the working class. In conclusion, the party will now constantly demand that the government expel Trotsky from the country, and firmly believes that with the strength of the party members and the masses of workers, it will be possible to prevent this person from openly engaging in political activities. (Havas Telegram on the 12th)

Mexico City. After Trotsky arrived here, the Federation of Primary School Teachers immediately decided to announce via radio that primary school teachers should explain to students the character of Trotsky as a "traitor to the working class" in their daily classes from now on. Five hundred Communist Party members in a large city, most of whom were primary school teachers and students aged 14 to 16, held a demonstration today to respond to the above measures to express their opposition to Trotsky. When the police heard the news, they sent 60 police officers and 100 security guards to suppress the demonstration and fired shots. As a result, seven people were injured. It is reported that the anti-Trotsky faction will hold another large-scale demonstration tomorrow. (Havas Telegram on the 12th)

### French Parliament Reopens

House of Representatives Elects Speaker

[Paris] The House of Representatives reconvened today for the first meeting since the new year. As usual, the oldest member, Salle, gave the opening speech, saying that at a time when the threat of conflict between nations around the world is increasing, the French people are united in supporting peace. The situation has come to this point, and France is not to blame. The International Exposition, which will be held in Paris this year, can be seen as proof. "For such a noble cause, France spares no effort in actively preparing for it. Its belief in the peace of tomorrow is evident from this. From now on, the next twelve months must be an era of relaxed situation, which can be compared to the 'sacred truce' in the Middle Ages without shame, like a bright morning star shining through the bloody sky of the Middle Ages." After Salle's speech, the entire audience applauded enthusiastically. Afterwards, the speaker and vice-speakers were elected. Radical Socialist Party leader Herriot was re-elected as speaker with 384 votes against 9 votes. Five people, including Bocan, a member of the orthodox Socialist Party, Dugurol, a member of the Communist Party, Barty, a member of the centrist Democratic Alliance Party, Marlan, a member of the right-wing Republican Democratic Union Party, and Xing Su Luan, were elected as vice-speakers. After the election, the meeting was adjourned until this Thursday to prepare the agenda. Observers generally believe that the international situation has now improved, and the future of the Blanc Cabinet can be optimistic. (Havas Telegram on the 12th)

### Britain Willing to Exert Full Effort to Seek International Economic Cooperation

"Rather Give Up Cannons for Butter" Easing Europe Has No Other Way Eden's Speech Apparently Aimed at Germany

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech at a banquet held by the Association of Foreign Journalists in London last night, advising the public to strive for international cooperation. Eden briefly said that when German Head of State Hitler received the Berlin diplomatic corps, he advocated that there should be sincere understanding and goodwill between countries. The British government is willing to warmly reciprocate this sincere sentiment. Journalists must exert their full efforts this year to engage in this work. As far as the people of Great Britain are concerned, he can assure everyone present that what they are working hard to achieve is also this work. Eden touched on the issue of rearmament, saying that the British government feels that it should be as determined as other countries that are rearming to show the determination necessary for national security, but Britain is unwilling to take this path because there is a better way. Therefore, it resolutely decided to seek butter rather than guns, and is prepared to exert its ability to seek the easing of Europe through economic cooperation, so that others can obtain butter in this world that does not require guns.

According to German Minister of Aviation and Dictator of the Four-Year Plan, General Goering, in a speech at the 10th anniversary of the Berlin Party Department of the National Socialist Party, he advised the people of the country to work hard and save money, and said that Germany lacks butter, so Hitler and Goering himself do not eat butter. The people of the country should take this as an example. Eden's speech may have been aimed at Goering's speech.

Eden then talked about the Spanish issue, saying, "At the beginning of the Spanish civil war, some people thought that the country's future political system would either become fascist or communist, but we don't think so. On the contrary, we believe that neither the fascist political system nor the communist political system can stand in Spain. What Spain will eventually adopt will be the political system that is most suitable for the country's national conditions. The more the intervention of other countries in the Spanish civil war is reduced, the closer the arrival of this period will be." (Havas Telegram on the 13th)

### Great Easing of Franco-German Relations

Schacht Visits France, Berlin Officials Deny

[Berlin] The tension between Germany and France caused by the activities of the German army in Spanish Morocco has come to an end, and this has been further confirmed. It is reported that German Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the Deutsche Bank, Dr. Schacht, will visit Paris in the coming days to reciprocate. Although this trip is nominally to visit the exhibits of the German part of the Paris Exposition, people in the business community expect that Schacht will discuss financial and economic issues related to Germany and France with the French authorities. There are even many rumors that Germany will negotiate a loan with France to purchase raw materials that the country urgently needs. (Reuters Telegram on the 13th)

[Berlin] The claim that German Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the Deutsche Bank, Dr. Schacht, will visit Paris in the coming days to reciprocate has been denied today in a statement issued by the German official news agency. The statement stated that commercial negotiations between Germany and France are currently being handled by qualified experts. Dr. Schacht is temporarily unable to go to Paris due to official duties. (Reuters Telegram on the 13th)

[Paris] After returning from Berlin this morning, the French Ambassador to Germany, Ponset, immediately met with Foreign Minister Delbos to discuss the matter. Observers generally expressed optimism about the situation of the talks. According to those observers, after German Head of State Hitler made an oral guarantee to Ponset yesterday, Ponset immediately reported to Delbos by long-distance telephone. The two immediately discussed issuing a bulletin to the newspapers so that the mutual guarantees between France and Germany could have a concrete form. The German newspapers have also published the above bulletin this morning, and the French people are quite satisfied. In addition, French military aide-de-camp Ruizai, a lieutenant in the Tangier International Neutral Port, has been issued a pass by Colonel Beberde, senior commissioner of Spanish Morocco, allowing him to travel freely to the area for inspection. This also makes people feel relieved, and they hope that the situation can gradually ease, so that various outstanding issues between France and Germany can be submitted for discussion.

### German Air Minister Goering Visits Rome

Entrusted with Important Mission

[Rome] German Minister of Aviation, General Goering, is scheduled to come here to visit on this day. His entourage includes a confidential secretary and several subordinates. The counselor of the Italian Embassy in Germany will also accompany him. Italian observers believe that this matter is of great importance.

Goering is using this trip to express this. Second, after Britain and Italy signed the Gentlemen's Agreement and Britain and France asked Germany, Portugal, Italy, and Russia to stop sending volunteers to Spain, the cooperation between Germany and Italy, especially on the Spanish situation, urgently needs to be adjusted.

### France Suggests to Britain Strict Surveillance of Seaports

[Paris] It is reported that the French government has proposed to Britain that strict salt inspection measures should be implemented immediately in all ports that can be used as departure points or transit points for arms to Spain and volunteers to join the country. In addition, the land border between Spain and France and Portugal is also often monitored. People here generally believe that after France and Germany made mutual guarantees on Morocco (referring to the mutual guarantees made by Hitler and the French ambassador to Germany, Ponset, yesterday), the European political situation has eased, and this may have a positive impact on various international issues caused by the Spanish civil war. (Havas Telegram on the 11th)

[Paris] It is reported that the government will ask the House of Representatives on Thursday to grant it the necessary powers to promulgate substitute legal orders prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain to fight. The French government has long decided to implement this ban, but only if other countries concerned take the same measures as a condition. As of last month, the relevant countries such as Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia had not made any decisions. France should wait a little longer. Therefore, it asked the House of Representatives to grant it the necessary powers instead of directly submitting a bill, because once the bill is passed by vote, it will be implemented immediately and cannot wait for the decisions of other countries. In addition, the French government is also eager to formulate a strict and effective monitoring method to monitor the export of arms and the joining of volunteers to foreign armies. On this level, the London Non-Intervention Committee has drafted a plan and submitted it to the parties involved in the Spanish civil war, advocating the establishment of an international committee in Spain to implement monitoring work. Although the Spanish Republican government has submitted a reply, it has not fully accepted it. As for the National Army government, it has not yet replied. (Havas Telegram on the 12th)

French Newspaper Discloses Content

[Paris] Madame Tabui, a diplomatic reporter for the Business Report, recently stated that General Foebel, the German envoy to Burgos, Spain, when he returned to Germany in December last year, requested Head of the Spanish National Army Government, General Franco, to send 80,000 troops to Spain to help fight. It is reported that Hitler has put forward five conditions. If General Franco accepts, Germany can send troops to help. The conditions are as follows: ㊀ Front-line battles should be directed by staff officers from Germany and Italy. ㊁ The land occupied by the Spanish National Army should be organized by the fascist Falange. The German National Socialist Youth League will select 300 trainers to assist them, but the Carlist royalists should not be allowed to participate in the organization. ㊂ The administrative affairs of Spanish Morocco in North Africa should be reorganized by German volunteers. ㊃ The economic rights of Spanish Morocco should be transferred to a joint German-Spanish company to operate. ㊄ After the National Army wins, German troops should still be stationed in Spain until the area is completely pacified.

### Copper Production Restriction Lifted

Global Supply Cannot Meet Demand, London Market Price Soars

[London] According to an official announcement, copper production restrictions will be temporarily lifted starting tomorrow. As a result, the steel market was extraordinarily excited again. After the opening, the price of three-month futures fell from £53 to £52.625. Subsequently, due to brisk trading and speculative purchases, the price soared, closing at £54.25. Market insiders believe that because the world's demand for copper is very high, the lifting of restrictions will not have an immediate impact. Furthermore, due to the soaring prices of all metals, many metal mines in the United States with very high costs have resumed mining. It is expected that there will be more to follow. Even so, steel prices may not necessarily decline, because according to today's gazette, the general public believes that if necessary, restrictions will be re-implemented. (13th Reuters)

### Numerous Ancient Artifacts Stolen in Henan Province, Yuan Tongli Reports After Investigation

Ancient Tombs and Buddha Statues All Severely Damaged, Executive Yuan Orders Henan Provincial Government to Protect

Nanjing News, the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee has repeatedly reported that ancient artifacts in Luoyang, Longmen, Huixian, and other places in Henan Province have been repeatedly stolen and excavated. If this continues, it will have a huge impact on ancient sites. The committee previously decided at the 16th Standing Committee meeting to appoint Yuan Tongli, a member of the committee, to go to investigate. After two weeks, he investigated the theft of ancient artifacts in Henan Province in detail and reported to the committee. Based on the situation, the committee immediately submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Military Affairs Committee, and then forwarded it to the Henan-Anhui Pacification Headquarters and the troops stationed in Henan. It also ordered the Henan Provincial Government to order the county governments to earnestly investigate and severely punish those who steal ancient artifacts in accordance with the law to protect ancient sites. The Executive Yuan has recently instructed the committee to approve the request and proceed accordingly. The original text of Yuan's report is recorded as follows:

The Situation of Tomb Raiding in Luoyang

Luoyang is the old capital of our country, with many ancient sites. To the north of the city and east of the city, there are many ancient tombs. In the past ten years, unearthed ancient artifacts have been mostly steel tools. The local people, seeing the great profits, have been privately excavating them, almost as a profession. They also use a kind of iron awl specifically for testing the land history. Along the Beiman Mountain area north of the city, there are countless traces of excavation. The strata are therefore chaotic, and ancient artifacts are damaged as a result, which is a great loss for academic and health purposes. According to investigations, tomb raiding in Luoyang occurs every month, especially in autumn and winter. This is because many local farmers are tomb raiders. After the autumn harvest, the seedlings are gone, so it will not hinder crops. It is rumored that tomb raiders mostly do it at night, fully armed, and well-organized. The scale is so grand that the local government officials and historians cannot stop it. This time, during the investigation, under the guidance of antique dealers, north of Jinggou Village and south of Zhengjiawa Village in Beiman Mountain, it was discovered that the local people were also carrying out large-scale excavation in broad daylight. There were more than 20 participants in the work, each holding an iron awl, testing different areas. They cheered wildly when they found something. In addition to reporting this situation to Wang Zemin, the administrative commissioner of the Tenth District, to quickly stop it, the committee should quickly devise a way to stop it without delay.

The Situation of Buddha Statue Theft in Longmen

Longmen, also known as Yique, is 25 li south of Haoyang City. The construction of caves and statues began in the Later Wei Dynasty and is the most precious sculpture in our country. In recent years, foreigners visiting Luoyang have been amazed and recorded treasures. Those that are exposed and easily acquired are often purchased from the villagers. Because the villagers can profit from it, they knock off the heads of stone Buddhas one by one, and occasionally destroy their entire bodies. The damage is increasing every year, which is also a great calamity for our country's ancient sites in recent years. This time, during the investigation, the damage to the Binyang Cave, Baxian Cave, Qianfo Cave, Wanfo Cave, Guoai Cave, and Lianhua Cave was the most severe. A list is as follows: In the Binyang Cave, the heads of four Buddha statues were knocked off. Inside and outside the cave, niche statues were beheaded, and some entire bodies were stolen. In the Baxian Cave, the faces of seven of the eight immortals have been destroyed. One of the immortals was destroyed recently. One Buddha head was beheaded, and one entire body was stolen. In the Qianfo Cave, none of the Buddha heads were spared. Very few of the small Buddha statues on both walls are intact. The Buddha statue facing north was stolen entirely. In the Wanfo Cave, the Buddha heads of the Buddha statues in the four corners were all destroyed. The Buddha heads in the north and south niches were also beheaded. The Buddha head on the right side of the entrance is the same. In the Guoai Cave, all ten Buddha heads were destroyed. In the Lianhua Cave, all three large Buddhas were destroyed, and the rest were also completely destroyed. Countless other niche statues outside each cave are incomplete or stolen. In 1933, Qian Zhuozhu wrote "The Famous Sites of Luoyang," and many Buddha statues in each cave were still intact. Now, it is full of scars, and the extent of the destruction has been the most severe in the past three years. It is rumored that most of those who steal Buddha heads are Hui people. South of Longmen, there is Waiao Village (also known as Weijiawa Village). The stone masons in the village all take stealing Longmen stone statues as a common profession. These people collude with bandits and often carry tall ladders and flashlights at night to carry out the destruction. The bandits mostly come from the south. After the destruction, they often flee to the south. In August, Ma Yunshi Laowu (living in Mapo, Dongcheng), Ma Luqu (living in Xinjie, Dongguan), Ma Ziming, and Shi Wenhua, etc., transported the beheaded stone Buddhas to Pingqiu for sale. At 12:00 on September 21, there were also thirty bandits, fully armed, carrying out large-scale theft. They were repelled by the Sixth Regiment of the garrison security forces, but Wei Lingzang (one of the twenty treasures of Longmen) was destroyed again. According to the deputy captain of the regiment, the regiment has more than one hundred people stationed in Longmen Village, which is more than one li away from the mouth of Longmen, so it is not easy to protect ancient sites. In addition, the Henan Construction Department is building the Yihe Bridge at the mouth of Longmen on the Luoyang-Ningluo Highway, employing more than 170 workers, all of whom live in the three caves of Binyang Cave and cook there, which also damages the ancient sites. However, the bandits ignore the more than 170 workers and repeatedly come to steal, which shows the magnitude of their power. If the local people are dismissed in the future, the extent of the damage will be even more unimaginable. This situation is extremely serious, and the committee should quickly devise another method.

The Situation of Tomb Raiding in Huixian

Huixian is the ancient Gongcheng, surrounded by outer walls. It is rumored that the tombs of the Duke of Gong and Jiang of Gong were excavated by Shi Yousan's troops three years ago. In August of this year, there was another tomb raiding incident by bandits in Liulige outside the city (on the highway between Huixian and Jixian). According to Pang Bingxun, the commander of the 40th Army of the Northern Henan Pacification Headquarters (stationed in Xinxiang), the local people had dredged the garrison and requested that they not interfere during the excavation. Later, because the loot was unevenly distributed, the local government reported to the county magistrate, Lü Da, who immediately recovered a bronze tripod, which was sent by the county government to the People's Education Center for preservation (now stored in the Henan Museum). There are still many ancient tombs there, and the trend of tomb raiding by scholars is very rampant. The number of excavation traces along the Jixian Avenue is very alarming. It is rumored that most of the masterminds are waiting in Xinxiang (one hour by car from Huixian). That place is where the Pinghan Road and Daqing Road connect, and transportation is convenient for private transportation, so the method of preventing it in the future is especially important in Xinxiang and Huixian.

### Chaozhou Tangerines Suffer from Pests and Diseases

40,000 Mu of Affected Tangerine Fields Discovered

Shantou News, the famous Chaozhou tangerines have been severely affected by root rot disease recently. Among them, only in the fourth and seventh districts of Chao'an, 40,000 mu of tangerine seedlings with this disease have been discovered. According to statistics from the Chaozhou Customs, the total number of Chaozhou tangerine exports in 1935 was two-thirds lower than the total number in 1924, the peak period. The decline is alarming. Last spring vacation, He Weiling and others from the Department of Plant Pathology of the College of Agriculture of Lingnan University in Guangzhou came to Shantou to investigate and also discovered that Chaozhou tangerines suffered from many types of pests and diseases. This year, taking advantage of the New Year's holiday, Wang Haozhen, a teaching assistant from the Department of Horticulture, was sent to Shantou to contact Chao'an farmers to rent tangerine gardens with citrus root rot disease in order to trial-plant famous domestic and foreign citrus rootstocks, hoping to find disease-resistant varieties to promote to tangerine farmers so that this root rot can be eliminated.

### Minnan Jiulong River Implements Western Fujian Timber Tax

18 Kinds of Harsh and Miscellaneous Taxes Already Exist Along the Coast, Timber Merchants Find it Difficult to Bear Further, Determined to Request Cancellation

Xiamen News, Fujian timber has always been famous in the country. The production areas are divided into northern Fujian and western Fujian. Timber from northern Fujian is exported through Fuzhou via the Min River. Most of the timber from western Fujian is exported through Zhangzhou via the Jiulong River, and a small part is exported through Shantou via the Han River. Those exported from Zhangzhou are mostly fir trees. At the peak, the annual value was more than one million yuan. In recent years, western Fujian has been plagued by bandits for a long time, and production has been low. Foreign timber takes the opportunity to dump, coupled with heavy domestic donations and taxes, the cost is too high, making it difficult to compete with foreign timber. The market has greatly萎缩, and exports have decreased to 400,000 to 500,000 yuan in recent years, a drop of more than 50%. Unexpectedly, starting from January 1st of this year, the Jiulong River North Creek has added a special business tax for this type of business, increasing the burden on timber merchants. Therefore, on January 7th, timber merchants in North Creek convened a general meeting of timber merchants in Zhangzhou to discuss countermeasures. The attendees believed that there were already as many as eighteen harsh and miscellaneous donations set up along the coast of the Jiulong River 流域 Longyan, Ningyang, Zhangping, Hua'an, and Longxi counties. Each timber raft, from the place of origin to Punan (40 li north of Zhangzhou), needs to pay more than 140 yuan in donations and taxes. Now, the special business tax on timber is being levied, which is really difficult to bear. As a result of the discussion, because the tax amount of the special business tax on timber is heavy and difficult to bear, and the business tax is held in North Creek alone, specializing in levying, it was decided to submit a separate report to the authorities requesting that the order be withdrawn and the levy stopped. The Haicheng County Port Tail in Zhangzhou originally had three types of grocery donations, firewood donations, and shell ash donations. Contractors undertook the business, with the contract amount for grocery donations being 540 yuan per year, firewood donations being 3,000 yuan per year, and shell ash donations being 180 yuan. The numbers were not large, but the contractors arbitrarily extorted them. All sailing ships passing through to transport goods to the mainland and sell firewood and shell ash were intercepted and donated. The boat people felt extremely painful. The boat people in Xiamen and the mainland repeatedly submitted reports to the province requesting that they be revoked. The provincial government ordered the Haicheng County Government to order the revocation. The Haicheng County Government had issued a notice on January 10th, revoking the three types of donations from January 1st of this year. The boat people in Zhangxia and the surrounding areas were pleased to hear this. (January 13th)

### Suzhou

Yin斜 Farmers Cause Trouble

佃 Farmers in Yishan, Xiangcheng, Chefang, and 𪷦tang, Wu County, caused floods of fires and hunger due to the shortage of goods two years ago. To this day, there are still major criminals in the wilderness who are detained by the court. Last autumn, the herdsmen had abundant crops, and the farmers in the villages were not as enthusiastic as before about paying the rent, but after the county government dispatched political police to the villages to collect it, the farmers have been paying the rent one after another. According to statistics, about 70% of the rent has been paid in the county. However, farmers in villages such as Chefang and 𪷦tang are still trying to resist the rent. Recently, the county government has sent a large number of political police, led by Zhu Guifang, to the villages to collect the rent from door to door. If there is resistance, they will be arrested and escorted to the city to pursue the rent. However, at about 7 o'clock on the night of the 12th, more than a hundred farmers in Lian𪷦xiang village, about three miles from the town of 𪷦tang (the village was very resistant to rent two years ago), held torches and went to Jinmiao and other towns in a surging manner to publicize the resistance to rent. At the same time, the same thing happened in Chefang. At that time, the public security organs were afraid that the situation would expand and become uncontrollable, so they immediately took strict precautions that night and urgently reported to the county government and the Public Security Bureau for verification. Director Zhang immediately sent the police chief, Qiang Lei, to the villages to suppress them with a patrol car early on the morning of the 13th. It was also learned that more than 300 farmers in Shuangmiao乡, Yishan district, had rushed to the house of the tax collector Xie at about 8 o'clock on the night of the 12th, and without asking the reason, they destroyed all the furniture and left. That night, the village security team was dispatched to suppress the farmers and disperse them. On the 13th, Xie came to Suzhou and reported to the Agricultural Improvement Association organized by the owners of the various guilds. The association, according to the report, approved the selection of representatives to visit the county chief and ask for instructions on how to handle it.

Rickshaw Labor Dispute

The labor and management of the rickshaw industry in the county have been in dispute over the car rental issue for several months and have not yet been resolved. The鯀 Party Department has repeatedly convened meetings between labor and management to mediate and set a standard of 30 cents per day for car rental. The management did not agree. Recently, the car dealers (i.e., the management) sent a letter to the General Labor Union to inform the rickshaw drivers' union that all vehicles (more than 3,000) would be rented out to the rickshaw drivers' union at a daily rental of 30 cents. The union expressed its acceptance. However, the car dealers delayed fulfilling the treaty and handing over the vehicles. On the 13th, the County Party Department ordered the car dealers to fulfill the treaty that day and asked the car dealer's illegally organized vehicle license maintenance association to be dissolved immediately.

Yao Fuchui Dies of Serious Injuries

In the case of Yao Fuchui, the accountant of the Liuhe Yibing Trading Company, being shot, it is now learned that Yao died of serious injuries on the 12th, and the perpetrator was not a police detective from the County Public Security Bureau, but only a private partner of Wang Yuezhi, the deputy head of the County Bureau's Detective Team, so he did not have a police detective license or an order or handwritten note from the director, nor was he led by a superior officer. After the accident, two of them were detained by the people, and the rest fled. According to the detainees, they were ordered by Wang Yuezhi to come here to arrest thieves. The people became even more angry upon hearing this. The county government sent Secretary Fang to Liuhe together with the inspectors to investigate and verify. Yi Zhen was mistaken by the people as a member of the Public Security Bureau and was beaten and humiliated. He put forward three conditions to Fang, but no results were achieved. Director Yang and Huang Songsheng, the owner of the Yihe Trading Company, had a conflict over the phone, so Yang did not go to Liuhe. Now Wang Yue has been ordered to be dismissed, and the case seems to have turned to other disputes, with each side insisting on their own views, making it difficult to resolve for a while. The people of the whole county are paying close attention to it.

At about 1 o'clock in the morning on the 12th, five or six bandits suddenly arrived at Sanyi Village near Huangshan in Sanbei乡, the third district of Wujin County, and jumped over the wall to rob the house of Ma Xianliang. At that time, Liu Guisheng, a farmhand of the Ma family, woke up and planned to go outside to capture them. The bandits immediately drew their pistols and shot at him, hitting him in the left shoulder and knocking him to the ground, bleeding profusely. Then the neighbors heard the gunshots and gathered to encircle and capture them. The bandits, knowing that things were not going well, began to flee in panic. The injured man was carried to Wujin Hospital for treatment after dawn and tried to have the bullet removed. His life should be out of danger.

Major Fire Erupts Outside the South City

The Sanxingchang flax and rice mill, located east of the South Gate of Jiaxing, was a joint venture, with shareholders from Pinghu holding the majority. The manager was Master Lu Sheng, and the business scope was quite extensive. At the time, there were over a thousand dan of rice stored in the stone warehouse located across from the mill, between house numbers 9 and 13. The upper floor was piled with flax, and the lower floor was used to store rice. The doors were typically blocked to load and unload goods, with few people going in and out. No one stayed there overnight. Unexpectedly, at around 4 PM on the 12th, a fire broke out in the pile of flax on the upper floor. A passerby noticed it and immediately sounded the alarm. Despite attempts to put out the fire, it was impossible to control. Subsequently, local firefighters arrived to help extinguish the blaze, and after three hours, it was finally brought under control. Thanks to their efforts, the fire did not spread to neighboring buildings. However, both the front and rear warehouses of the mill were completely destroyed, resulting in losses of over ten thousand yuan. The cause of the fire is believed to be spontaneous combustion in the flax. Public security authorities are currently investigating the matter to determine the exact cause.

### Xiqing Basketball Suffers Another Disappointment, Jinan Still Defeated by Xintong

25-41 Xintong Comes from Behind; Xin Team 29-47 Loses to Mailing

The Xiqing basketball tournament will soon come to an end. Last night, two exciting games were played as a final flourish. Two strong teams from the Chinese side, Jinan and Xin, played against Xintong and Mailing, respectively. Half an hour before the games, the Xiqing gymnasium was already packed. To ensure fairness, the Xiqing authorities specially appointed renowned referees Zhang Guoxun and Liu Hesheng to officiate the first game. As a result, Jinan played exceptionally well in the first half, leading throughout. However, about five minutes into the second half, Xintong took the lead for the first time at 22-20. After that, Jinan declined rapidly and suffered a crushing defeat of 41-25. In yesterday's game, Han Zhenyuan, Jinan's best shooter, only scored one basket. Yao Yanan, Nan Zhen, and others missed their free throws in the last ten minutes, which was a major reason for the defeat. However, Xintong's long-range expert, Pisel, also had an off day, which shows how closely Jinan was guarding him. In the last game, Xin played against Mailing. Mailing, with their height and strength advantage, took the lead early on. The closest Xin got was 4-5 and 6-7. After that, they collapsed and fell behind by a huge margin of 10-30. In the second half, Xin played more spiritedly, scoring 19-17, two points more than Mailing. However, because they had lost so much ground in the first half, they ultimately suffered a crushing defeat of 47-29. The audience was disheartened to see the strong Chinese teams defeated by foreign teams. The details of the game between Jinan and Xintong are as follows. Both of today's games are in the university division and are purely Chinese teams competing against each other.

They called a timeout three times, replacing Yin Guiren with Yan Lianjin to rest. Han Zhenyuan fouled, and Lan Jin added another point. Yan Lianjin missed several free throws after Pisel's foul. Xintong relied on Carson's versatility, leading by as many as ten points. When Pisel fouled for the second time, Yan Yunjin made one of two free throws.

Jinan also replaced Nan Zhen with Zheng Jin Gan. In the last minute, Lan Jin and Guiren scored some points, but Jinan ultimately turned victory into defeat at 25-41, causing many fans to feel discouraged.

We fear that he may have mistakenly listened to false information, and we specially telegraphed to advise him to immediately follow the Central Government's post-incident plan, perform meritorious service to atone for his crimes, and thank the people of the country.

### Wang Yukai Broadcasts Lecture on Civic Training Issues (3)

㊁ Developing Scientific Knowledge - The development of foreign science is truly astonishing. Recently, there is a type of "Ediphone" placed at people's doors. If the owner has gone out, the guest can stand in front of this machine and say their surname, given name, the reason for the visit, and so on. When the owner returns home, the machine will replay the original sound one by one. Many foreign newspaper offices have recently used wireless teleprinters (Telctype), which are more convenient and economical for the development of the newspaper industry. In the past, many reporters and editors were required to do the work, but now a teleprinter can be used. News can be compiled in one place, and newspaper offices in other locations can also obtain the same news without having to spend much effort on interviewing. It is enough to simply select the news. Telephones can not only transmit sound, but also allow you to see the speaker's face. Naval battles can be commanded by radio, and radio can drive warships. Large companies can use robots to replace doormen. The development of science truly makes us admire it. China's current situation is 50 years behind European and Western countries, and frankly speaking, it is 100 years behind. In the future, we must earnestly inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, work hard to enrich our scientific knowledge, and catch up.

㊂ Cultivating Livelihood Skills - China has always had a large family system, and many people rely on one or two people in the family for their livelihood. They do not have productive skills and are simply economic parasites. This is a very serious problem in Chinese society. Everyone must have livelihood skills and engage in productive work so that the country can become prosperous and strong.

㊃ Training Group Habits - Schools and factories are organizations composed of a large number of people, and society is also a collection of many people. A person cannot live alone without a group of people. We must participate in group life. We should sacrifice the small self to achieve the greater self. Training group habits is a necessary method to improve group organization.

㊄ Vigorously Implement Military Training - Ancient Sparta became a strong country because it valued martial arts. The President of the United States is also called the Grand Marshal and concurrently serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Army, and Air Force. Therefore, many former US Presidents were military scholars. The current US President Roosevelt was also the former Undersecretary of the Navy. The Japanese recently tested the psychology of unmarried women, and many said that their ideal husband was a soldier. From this trend in the psychology of Japanese women, it can be seen that this is also a reason for their country's strength. There is a saying in China, "A good man does not become a soldier." This is a wrong view of valuing literature and belittling martial arts. We should carry out military training to correct its bad influence.

㊅ Arousing National Consciousness - Most people in our country are living in a drunken dream, without a national consciousness or a concept of the country, resulting in the jokes in the two stories mentioned above and the existence of those traitors. We should have a clear national consciousness and a belief in living and dying with China. It must be known that the Republic of China is where our ancestral tombs and homes are located, and the Chinese nation is a group that we cannot separate from for generations to come.

The above six points are what I personally believe Chinese citizens should work hard to do today. If you think it is wrong, please correct me. If you think it is right, you should put it into practice immediately, encourage each other, and build a new China together. (End)

### Yarn & Cotton

Third-Grade Products Reacting - Cotton Yarn Falls Sharply - Actual Sales Unpopular, Most in the Trade Anticipating Declines - Yarn Spinning Profitable, Factories Processing and Shipping

The yarn market is trending weak and declining again, largely because yarn sales in Shanghai are not strong. Transactions of 10-count coarse yarn are particularly quiet, leading to increasing stockpiles. In addition, prices of third-grade yarn in Osaka have fallen back, further weakening confidence. Although various measures are being taken to hold prices firm, they are not being abandoned. However, industry sources say that yarn factories can make tens of yuan of profit per bale, and factories should process and spin accordingly. Given the current actual demand, there will naturally be a large surplus. The number of yarn bales for delivery will inevitably increase, leading to expectations of price declines. Ultimately, the future direction depends on actual sales.

Standard Yarn Falls Another 2.8 Yuan

Opening prices for contract yarn in all months fell consistently in the morning session, showing significant weakness, due to reports of falling third-grade yarn prices. At the same time, yarn sales in Shanghai were sluggish, leading most in the trade to expect declines. As a result, the market became increasingly loose. After the initial trading, third-grade yarn telegraphed prices from Japan, showing only a decline of 0.3 yuan for the current month, but declines of 6 yuan to 3, 4, and 5 yuan for forward months. The market became even softer, trending downward. As a result, prices for all months fell by 1.25 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. However, the closing price of third-grade yarn had not yet arrived. The afternoon session opened, and when the previous session's closing price of third-grade yarn arrived, the current month fell by 10 yuan, while forward months also fell by about 10 yuan. As a result, prices for all months fell by 10.02 to 15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market then suspended trading without auction. This caused fear and uncertainty, and trading in spot yarn was dull. Rumors spread that the trend of coarse yarn was becoming increasingly narrow, with strong selling pressure. Market prices declined step by step. As a result, prices for all months fell by 1.3, 4, and 6 yuan compared to the morning session's closing price. The number of bales sold: Jinchang 2,750 bales, Gengfeng 2,150 bales, Changfeng 5,000 bales, Xiacheng 950 bales, Xingchang 700 bales, Shenji 1,000 bales, Renfeng 1,990 bales, Wang Taixing 1,150 bales, Yongda 900 bales, Tonghe 1,850 bales, Tongji 850 bales. The number of bales bought: Yiji 1,000 bales, Hengchang 500 bales, Deda 500 bales, Shenchang 650 bales, Dachangcheng 2,250 bales, Runkang 1,350 bales, Dachang 1,500 bales, Changji 900 bales, Yuaner 1,550 bales, Yicheng 750 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed below:

500 Bales of Futures Traded

Spot yarn sales remained ordinary. Total purchases by various guilds for the day were 884 bales, with prices falling by 1 yuan. Among them, there were 500 bales of February-March futures yarn. The purchase amount of each guild is listed below:

Supply of Fine Cotton May Be Affected - Auction Cotton Not Willing to Sell Lightly

The cotton market is calm. Current demand for cotton yarn is indeed not strong. However, Indian cotton and American cotton have both risen. In addition, the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu is not good, and the supply to Shanghai may be affected. As a result, there are few new sellers, and the market seems to be slightly higher than the yarn market.

Futures Cotton Slightly Up 0.1-0.2 Yuan

Opening prices for cotton in the morning session. Although English and Indian cotton rose, Osaka third-grade cotton rose in the near term, while futures prices plummeted by 2 yuan in the long term. Market confidence was normal. After the second round of trading, the market remained stable. Due to the poor situation in Shaanxi and Gansu, the supply via the Longhai Railway may not be smooth. New sellers are lacking, and the market situation is still calm. As a result, prices for all months were unchanged compared to the previous day's closing price, but the current month was up by a small 0.05 yuan. The afternoon session opened with the previous session's Osaka third-grade cotton closing prices, with rapid drops of more than 2 yuan for futures contracts. As a result, near-term prices rose 0.4 yuan compared to the previous day's price and fell 1.4 to 2.5 yuan. Long-term prices plummeted 4.5 yuan, and market sentiment was shocked. Selling pressure was slightly stronger. As a result, prices for all months fell by an average of 0.15 yuan compared to the morning session's closing price. Number of bales sold: Tongji 2,000 bales, Daji 1,600 bales, Dachangcheng 2,300 bales, Runkang 2,800 bales, Jinchang 2,700 bales, Changfeng 1,900 bales, Xiacheng 2,300 bales, Yuaner 1,100 bales, Yikang 1,900 bales, Xinchang 1,100 bales, Changhe 4,600 bales. Number of bales bought: Dafu 2,100 bales, Yuda 5,900 bales, Zhenda 1,420 bales, Renfeng 2,900 bales, Wang Taixing 1,200 bales, Tonghe 1,300 bales, Yuanda 1,400 bales, Yuan Xingchang 2,200 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed below:

Good Consumption of Spot Cotton

The number of factories is slightly increasing. The sources are 1,180 bales of Yaohua cotton and 1,268 bales of Tonghua cotton.

Third-Grade Yarn and Cotton Falls Sharply

Osaka telegram on the 13th: There was only half-day trading for third-grade products. Futures yarn fell 10.2 to 15 yuan, with the near-term contract at 287.1 yuan and the long-term contract at 168 yuan. Futures cotton rose 0.4 to fell 4.5 yuan, with the near-term contract at 76.7 yuan and the long-term contract at 76.95 yuan.

American, Indian, and English Cotton Prices All Rise

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with active trading. This was due to good news from Liverpool, with the exchange estimating December consumption at 685,000 bales, and continued activity in yarn and cloth, with the international political situation appearing favorable. Prices rose by 1 to 5 points for each month. Later, after the long positions closed, some believed that the market price had reached its peak and sold off, and prices retreated slightly. However, large industry players actively purchased March and May contracts, absorbing all of the sell-off. New traders from outside the industry were mediocre. Industry players are still waiting for the sale of cotton collateralized with loans. At the close, industry players and cooperatives bought in, and prices strengthened again. Spot cotton rose by 6 pounds (universal), and futures rose by 6 to 11 points (universal). English spot cotton rose by 4 points, and futures rose by 4 to 7 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by exporters, futures traders, and speculators, but then retreated due to hedging and long positions taking profits. Pingguoer rose 1.25 to 2.75 rupees, Aomula rose 2.25 to 2.75 rupees, and Bairoxi rose 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

According to a telegram from Bombay, the forecast for the opening on the 13th was: Bairoxi at 232 rupees, Aomula at 208.5 rupees, and Pingguoer at 184.75 rupees, all down by 0.5 rupees.

### Piece Goods

Cotton Cloth Sales Gradually Expanding - Yarn Poplin Gray Cloth Rises to 0.27 Yuan - Prices Soar in Shaanxi, Henan, etc. Due to Shortages

Yesterday, the cloth market was slightly weak due to the sudden surge in the decline of third-grade and domestic yarn markets. However, the trend of each cloth gradually became clear, and gray cloth was particularly tight. Yesterday, Shangdong Cotton Trading Company continued to recover the poplin and other gray cloths originally ordered due to the surprisingly high price of domestic cloth, causing the price of yarn poplin gray cloth to rise sharply to 0.27 yuan per yard. Sales prices of yarn poplin on the market also increased sharply, by 0.01 yuan per yard. Military uniforms of 16-pound coarse cloth were ordered in large quantities, and each Chinese factory has ordered more than 2,000 pieces, all of which must be delivered in February and March. The remaining spot goods are limited. Dyeing factories also require richer colors for Sichuan and Beilu colored cloth and colored twill, and continue to absorb fine cloth and fine twill. Ning Shao guild from Zhejiang Lu continuously imported 200+ pieces of light and heavy coarse cloths and other goods. Shandong guild also continued to import Serge wool. Due to poor transportation in the Northwest Shaanxi and Henan guilds, cloth prices soared locally due to shortages, and the demand for goods was extremely urgent. The two Yue guilds from Nanlu imported a lot of plain silk poplin for spring, and white satin. Fine twill remains dull in intentions. Therefore, the sales prices of each good vary in high and low. However, the situation is generally firm and stable, shifting with actual needs.

### Sugar Market

Dutch Sugar Rises Three Times - Dutch White Sugar in Shanghai Rises Another 0.5 Yuan - 40,000 Bags of Contract Sugar All Cleared

Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market continued to rise. According to a Reuters telegram from Surabaya on the 12th, the Dutch East Indies Sugar Company announced today that the export price of sugar rose by 0.2 Dutch guilder, which is the third price increase this year. Therefore, the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association marked: 24 coarse sand white spot goods at 23 yuan, up 0.5 yuan, and transit goods at 7.5 yuan, up 0.2 yuan, both with transactions. Dongbai spot goods No. 4 at 23 yuan, 转口J唛 at 8 yuan, No. 8 spot goods H唛 at 22.8 yuan, 转口N之唛 at 7.7 yuan, No. 9 spot goods H唛 at 22.7 yuan, 转EYRO唛 at 7.3 yuan. These had increased by 0.3-0.4 yuan per day previously. This factory's Mianbai Zhenji No. 1 at 21.6 yuan, up 0.3 yuan, No. 2345, each grade retreated by 0.4 yuan. Jinxin Dahua shouted 21.8 yuan, up 0.5 yuan, No. 2245, each grade retreated by 0.2 yuan. Chao guild opened at 14.5 yuan for No. goods 提青, Huanggang Qing at 12.1 yuan, with over 100 bags sold. Mianchi at 16.3 yuan, less than 100 bags opened.

Yesterday, the joint venture company held the second contract auction for this week, totaling 4,000 bags of Huizhou medium sand white, and another 32,800 bags, and another 1,280 bags, and another 1,500 bags, all at 20 yuan, up 0.4 yuan, all cleared. The tight trend can be seen here.

### Grain

England Prepares to Store Grain - Foreign Wheat Turns from Falling to Rising - Forward Wheat Market in Shanghai Slightly Smooth

Reuters telegram from New York on the 12th: The Chicago wheat market was stable. It initially fell due to spot help selling, but soon there were rumors that the English cabinet proposed to the parliament to store grain, and customers bought in, with spot firms buying back, and prices stabilized, rising 0.25 to falling 0.625.

In the Shanghai wheat market, due to the account settlement, transactions within and outside Shanghai were completely invisible and stopped. Although there were quotations for each month, it was not lively. This situation is the same every year, and it is not surprising. Until the afternoon opening, this month did not open, and futures trading was slightly smooth, with prices also increasing. The factory settlement in the later stage, such as the current foreign wheat price approaching the factory, must be renewed. The change in the market should be decided here. The current wheat market is also stagnant, because the number of factories is normal, and each stall does not have formal trading. The Tong market only opens a few hundred bags, and the price is similar to the previous day.

End-of-Accounting Period Approaching - Futures Flour Trading Very Quiet

After the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month showed a consistent sluggish trend. According to foreign wheat quotes, Chicago rose by 0.2 yuan in the near term and fell by 0.08 to 0.2 yuan in the long term. Canada fell by 0.04 to 0.2 yuan. After the price was quoted, due to the approaching end-of-accounting period, most parties stopped buying and selling, so there were very few transactions, and breathing also increased. The shouting price for each month fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Until the afternoon opening, it was still calm at first, and then the foreign long positions slightly sold out due to the still clear trading, and the market atmosphere gradually loosened, with prices falling by 0.2 yuan in the near term and 0.15 yuan in the long term compared to the previous day's closing price. According to the current trend, the factory's inventory is still expensive with flat actual sales, and this month should have a small reduction.

Guangdong Guild Buys Large Amounts of Coarse and 客秈 Rice

Large amounts of 客秈 rice arrived yesterday, with 15,000 to 16,000 bags arriving daily. However, the going-out was also heavy. Yesterday, the Guangdong guild continued to import, buying 13,000 to 14,000 bags of brown rice, and 6,000 to 7,000 bags of machine rice. Shantou continued to compete for imports. In addition to machine rice and brown rice, there was also a transaction of 1,000 bags of Siamese rice. Local hoarders in this street also saw active hopping, because at a time when all grains are expensive, rice prices are still low, leading to the attention of passenger hoarders. However, the industry opinion is that with abundant production and a continuous supply, it is difficult to soar excessively. Yesterday, brown rice rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and other major ones rose by about 0.1 yuan. Total daily openings: 16,000+ bags of Jiangxi rice, 10,825 bags of Hunan rice, 5,000 bags of Hankou brown rice, 1,377 bags of Wenyong rice, 1,000 bags of foreign 客秈 Siamese rice.

River Rice Sales Turn Flat - High Prices for Several Days, Source Very Strong Afterwards - Over 400 Rice Boats Stopped North of Shanghai

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang turned rare compared to before, with a total of 30+ numbers arriving, with a total of 6,500 to 6,600 stones. Among them, there were 16-17 numbers of Bo Dao. Because it is the end of the small month, the sales market on this street is rarely visited, and the bag stomach has also turned clear, with only the Qingdao gang importing 500 to 600 bags of Bo Dao. Therefore, although there are few arrivals, most goods cannot be sold, and the market is difficult to cheer up, presenting a soft trend in the fixed. Considering the sluggishness of the zero several stomach, the market may be difficult to stand on its feet today. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan arrival sales are balanced, without ups and downs.

(North Shanghai) Since the National New Year's Day holiday to the 4th opening, rice prices have risen day after day. Each producing area heard of the high prices, so they transported them to Shanghai one after another to seek good prices. Unexpectedly, the going-out was sluggish on the day of transportation, with over 400 boats accumulated, and prices fell by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan in these days, and the going-out still felt smooth. From the previous day, each passenger was unwilling to sell due to excessive losses. Yesterday, 30+ ships arrived from each road. Although the going-out of each good on the market was normal, prices did not increase or decrease. The price of 粳 is heard to be flat and tired, the high-grade Bo Dao is settled, and the medium and second-grade are slightly soft, and the prices of other goods have not gone up or down.

Soybeans Rise Again 0.03-0.05 Yuan - 洋莊 Sesame Transactions 700 Tons

Yesterday's soybean market situation continued the remaining power of the previous day, rising again by 0.03-0.05 yuan. However, the transaction volume decreased compared to before, largely because Dalian first rose and then was flat, and the human heart could not avoid being frustrated. The Tong market opened 5 cars of Linhuaiguan beans, 4 cars of Bengbu beans, 1 car of Sipingjie beans, 4,000 bags of Hankou Zha beans, 1,000+ bags of Hankou Chi beans, 200 bags of Jiujiang Chi beans, 170+ bags of Jiujiang Duo beans, 400 bags of Wuhu soybeans, and 400 bags of Chongming Sha Huang. The going-out involved sales to oil factories, gardens, Tongzhou, Nanyang, and this street. 洋荘 sesame continued to open at 5 yuan, and 2 wells Dafu actually lowered the fan bank to handle 700 tons, and the market trend remained stable.

Bond Market in Stand-off Between Bulls and Bears

Yesterday, the government bond market was in a stand-off between bulls and bears and remained extremely dull. The chaotic political situation meant that sentiment was difficult to improve, and transactions were as sparse as ever. The surface remained silent, and there was no sign of a breakout. However, because there were approximately 27 million yuan in deposited accounts this month, many retail investors were switching positions and settling, and market prices showed signs of weakness. The momentum seemed to be brewing. At the morning opening, sentiment was quite weak, and there were many sellers of stakes, with retail investors selling enthusiastically. Market prices all fell by five cents to one dime. Class A and Class E showed good strength for this month's start. In the second session, market conditions became firmer again, with strong buying interest in issues 47 and 42. Class E and Class B all rebounded by about one dime, while Class A showed a slight decline of five cents. At the afternoon opening, trading became even scarcer and the market was stagnant. There was a considerable amount of selling in issue 10.4, while issue 42 continued to see buying interest. Market prices only differed by five cents. Closing trading was still sluggish, and issues 10.4 and 16 continued to see selling, while issue 43 continued to see strong buying. Class E was slightly better by five cents this month, while all other issues declined by five cents to two dimes. The total value of transactions was 3.105 million yuan. The table below compares the gains and losses, highs and lows. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)

Political News Favorable - European Bond Markets Prosper

London, November 11 (Reuters) - Businessmen view the interpretation of the political situation as better than before, and interest in the securities market has revived. Trading in speculative stocks of the party is particularly active, and prices have also risen considerably. Government bonds are firm, and the German leader Hitler's peaceful attitude has made European bonds prosper. South African gold mining stocks led today's rally, and most gold mining stocks all surged. Within industrial stocks, steel and coal stocks are in good demand. Within electrical appliance and automobile stocks, there was a slight increase in tobacco stocks. The Royal Tobacco Company, due to rumors of issuing bonus shares, was sought after by merchants. Copper stocks hovered, awaiting the outcome of discussions on lifting quotas. Oil stocks were weak, due to rumors of India reducing oil prices, but speculators continued to purchase Mexican Eagle Oil. Canadian oil stocks were quite firm, and rubber stocks rose well with very little trading. International diamond stocks and tin stocks all rose slightly.

Another dispatch reported that today was the first opening of British colonial wool auctions in London this year. Although there were many arrivals from various places, the public bought enthusiastically, resulting in a rise of seven and a half to fifteen cents.

### North-South Goods

Hainan Dried Longan Opens at a Slightly Lower Price

Hainan dried longan, previously with few sales, quotation prices were not willing to be too loose, and there had been no opening for a long time. Yesterday, it was heard that the quoting party had sold a small number of pieces, and the price was about a yuan lower than before. Transactions amounted to over 100 pieces. Whether the rest will continue to open will depend on the intentions of the owners.

### Silk and Tea

Overseas Silk Prices Soar - Japanese Silk Rises 63 Yuan Compared to the End of the Year - Yesterday, Chinese Silk Also Cleared Customs at 800 Yuan

Recently, foreign silk markets have seen repeated price increases, and the rising trend was even stronger yesterday. New York's 83-degree Japanese silk rose by five cents, the 75-degree rose by four cents, Shanghai silk 78-degree rose by five cents, Guangdong silk rose by four cents. The exchange's standard silk near-term rose by five cents, the forward rose by four cents, a rise of one dime to one dime and one cent compared to the market price at the end of last year, December 31st. Calculated in the Jia market, each dan rose by 48 yuan, 88 cents. Yokohama raw silk, yesterday the current forward rate rose by 18 yuan to 28 yuan, compared with the Yokohama spot price on the last day of last year (December 29th), yesterday's market price rose by 63 yuan. The Lyon silk market yesterday, except for Guangdong silk which remained at the original price, other Chinese and Japanese raw silks each rose by half a franc. Yesterday, foreign firms in this port sold a considerable amount of white factory 78-degree even-grade direct-reeled silk, selling at 800 yuan. Those returning from overseas opened at a rumored 830 yuan, a rise of about 20 yuan compared to the previous price. In addition, demand from users was also strong. The market price was about the same. The total sales in the city were 335 bales.

### Metals

Double-Linked Tinplate Sells for Over 40 Yuan

Yesterday's price of double-linked tinplate had opened at 40.05 yuan (German and Italian gambling goods), while American goods were quoted at 44 yuan, both showing a rise of two yuan compared to before. Transactions were with the Yantai, Qingdao, and Xuzhou gangs. In addition, 100-pound American goods were quoted at 49 yuan to 50 yuan, and German and Italian goods opened at 45 yuan, also one yuan better than before, but transactions were relatively sparse. According to the recent surge in overseas markets, there is fear that the market in this port will continue to improve in the future.

Old Iron Products Searched Clean by Japanese Merchants

Since last month, due to the small amount of incoming old iron products, prices have soared, so the market in this port has also risen sharply. Items such as sheared ends, foreign coin ends, rail skin ends, and square white lead wires have all surged. Therefore, recently, old iron merchants have made huge profits and are showing joy. Because overseas old iron ports need three to four months before there is spot supply to Shen, recently all goods have been purchased by the Japanese side, so the market situation is very brisk.

### Miscellaneous Items

Imports of Japanese Goods Can Be Called Extremely Prosperous

Recently, imports of Japanese goods can be called the most prosperous period. Yesterday, the two towns of Mikasayama and Asosan arrived in Shanghai, carrying a total of over 4,400 tons of cargo, including 1,750 packages of rayon, 3,980 packages of sugar, 6,600 pieces of iron sheet steel plate, and over 6,000 pieces of starch, slate, and alkali slate.

### Special Feature: The Reason for the Soaring Price of Paper

Due to Shared Raw Materials with Rayon - Newsprint Rolls Rise by 50 Percent - This Year Will Create a New Record for the Paper Industry

According to Mr. Shima Oldson, chairman of the Shanghai Paper Importers Association, the following report on the paper industry over the past year is briefly summarized: The consumption of paper in the past year has seen significant activity due to the progress of manufacturers. From January to September, the progress of paper prices was extremely significant. In September and October, there was a slight increase. At the end of October, due to the sudden increase in demand from various regions, paper prices soared. In three or four weeks, the price of newsprint rolls rose by about 50 percent, and some paper mills around the world had already pre-ordered the output for July and August 1937 by the end of last November. Due to the soaring prices of raw materials and other items used in papermaking, general paper mills have refused to pre-order products after July and August this year. Investigating paper, it is an important tool for promoting the prosperity of various industries, and it is also an indispensable thing for various industries. Therefore, due to the increase in the demand for paper, it is not difficult for us to foresee that in 1937, the economic climate in various parts of the world will gradually recover.

It is estimated that in 1937, the wood pulp used for manufacturing rayon in the United States will increase by an average of about 1,000 tons per day compared to last year. From this, we can glimpse the significant progress made by the paper and wood pulp industries in the past few years. Because in recent years, science has made increasing progress, and wood pulp has been widely used in rayon manufacturing. The fiber in wood pulp is used as a substitute for cotton and wool by textile manufacturers. Rayon manufacturers are using wood pulp in the Scandinavian Peninsula in Europe (i.e., Sweden, Norway, etc.) and in Britain and Germany. Therefore, in the coming decades, we will see that the position of cotton production in the United States and Egypt will be taken away by the forests in Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, and other places. And the raw materials used for papermaking are the same as the raw materials used for rayon manufacturing, so because of this mutual relationship, the long-depressed paper price can be expected to rise day by day. At present, the papermaking industry and the wood pulp manufacturing industry are each exerting their full efforts and striving hard, so in 1937, or even more so, a new record in the paper industry will be created. Chinese paper merchants do not seem to have a full understanding of the position of the world paper market, so generally speaking, they have not fully purchased the required paper products at low prices, and at present, there is a panic about the lack of application of certain types of paper.

### Li Kan's Wife

— Jie Ren

A Woman Courageous in Resisting the Enemy

During the Tang Dynasty, Li Kan served as the magistrate of Xiangcheng County in Henan Province. He encountered the rebellion of Li Xilie, who successively captured many cities and towns within Henan Province. His power grew day by day, and now he was about to divide his troops to attack Xiangcheng County. Li Kan heard this news and was very afraid. He wanted to take advantage of the fact that the enemy had not yet arrived to lead his entire family and flee the city.

Li Kan told his wife, Madam Yang, about his idea. Madam Yang did not think so and explained the greater righteousness to him, saying: "When the enemy soldiers come to attack, we should fight hard to resist, fulfilling the responsibility of defending the territory. If our strength is not enough to defeat the enemy soldiers, then we will die! How can you keep talking about running away? Moreover, the county magistrate is the head of a county. In reason, in addition to defending the territory, he also has the duty to protect the people. How can you only care about yourself?"

After hearing Madam Yang's words, Li Kan suddenly felt the baseness of his behavior, and a sense of loyalty and righteousness arose spontaneously. However, even though he said this, he was ultimately a timid and lazy man. As soon as he thought of the fierceness of the bandits, he could not help but look worried.

Li Kan thought for a long time before opening his mouth to Madam Yang and saying, "I never wanted to escape! However, we have too few soldiers in the city, and our military supplies are very limited. The bandits are so fierce, how can we resist them? Therefore, I thought: 'Rather than be defeated in battle and cause disaster to the people, it is better to abandon the city and escape to protect ourselves and protect the people.' Now, I have realized that this behavior is too base; but resisting the enemy is not something that can be done by talking about it, it must be prepared in advance, so how shall we prepare?"

Madam Yang, after hearing her husband's words, replied with confidence: "What difficulty is there in this! If a county is not defended, the territory of that county becomes the enemy's territory; the warehouses and treasuries in that territory all belong to the enemy. As for the people, of course, they will be forced to become the suicide squads for their future power struggles. As long as you can use this idea to enlighten the people and awaken them, so that they all know that disaster has befallen each of them; then, you can inspire them with righteousness and help them with strength, and then you can lead them to kill the enemy."

Li Kan felt that Madam Yang's plan was very good. He immediately summoned all the people in the city to the open space in front of the county government office. Kan warned them loudly, saying: "The enemy soldiers are coming soon. I thought: take advantage of the fact that they have not yet reached the city walls, and all of you have come here to discuss a method to resist the enemy together. All of you have grown up in Xiangcheng, with homes and fields here; relatives and friends here; and the tombs of your ancestors here. If Xiangcheng is unfortunately occupied by the enemy soldiers, it will directly affect your place very much. Although I am an official here, after my term is over, I will be relieved of my duties and go elsewhere, so the future of Xiangcheng being occupied by the enemy soldiers will cause me very little loss. However, the county magistrate is the head of a county, and in reason, he has the duty to protect the territory and protect the people. Now, I have decided to defend Xiangcheng to the death, but my strength alone is limited. I must unite with everyone, stand on the same battle line, and fight hard to resist. All of you are loyal men, and I think you will not disappoint me, right?"

The crowd was greatly moved when they heard this, and each one rubbed their fists and palms, willing to fight the enemy soldiers under Li Kan's leadership. Li Kan was secretly surprised to see this situation. Madam Yang was beside him, comforted in her heart that the hearts of the people in Xiangcheng had not died. So, the couple immediately selected hundreds of strong men, formed them into teams, and sent them to the city walls overnight to defend them.

At the fifth watch the next day, the bandits indeed arrived. Li Kan personally went to the city tower to supervise the battle; his wife, Madam Yang, also personally cooked meals to provide for the soldiers. The two sides fought from morning until noon without stopping. Many enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, but no one in the city was injured. That night, the bandit leader Li Xilie, unable to win,调来又调来大队贼兵.预备在晚上乘虚製击可是城内早有防备，结果依然失败。

Three days passed. The two sides were still in a stalemate. Once, Li Kan was wounded by a stray arrow and went down to his home to recuperate. Madam Yang, seeing this, questioned him sternly and solemnly, saying: "Which woman in the world does not love her husband? Because she loves her husband, she hopes that he can make a magnificent career in his lifetime and leave a name for himself in future generations. Now you can lead the militia of Xiangcheng County to resist the bandits. Although it cannot be said to be a great career, at least you can gain a reputation for being loyal and brave, which is very different from being a coward who is greedy for life and afraid of death, and who wants to escape at the first sign of trouble. However, anyone who can truly lead the resistance against bandits must always be the first to charge into the breach. Only in this way can the military appearance be revitalized, the morale of the soldiers be boosted, and the purpose of repelling the enemy soldiers can be achieved. Just now you only suffered a little injury, which is not a big deal, how can you leave the warriors who are working with you to kill the bandits and return to your own home? You should understand that an army without a leader is like a boat without a rudder. If you are not there, who will be willing to defend for you? General Ma Yuan of the Han Dynasty said: 'A man should die on the border, and his body should be wrapped in horsehide and buried.' If you can understand these two sentences, you can understand that dying outside is more meaningful and valuable than dying in bed."

Li Kan felt that what Madam Yang said was right, so he carried his wound and returned to the city to supervise the battle. The militiamen saw that Li Kan was so dedicated despite being wounded, and everyone was even more afraid of being negligent.

They continued to defend for two days and two nights. The food in the city gradually became scarce, and the arrows gradually ran out, almost falling into an extremely dangerous situation. But in the end, because the defending soldiers were hardworking and brave, they shot and killed a great general in the bandit camp. The bandits dared not love the battle and withdrew their troops, lifting the siege of Xiangcheng.

### Langey "S.P. Langey 1834-1906"

— Guo Xuan

Inventor of the Airplane

"Buzz!" An airplane with a red sun emblem flew overhead. Ah! This modern winged tiger! Can you truly conquer everything we have?

"To fly," this is a desire that everyone has had in their hearts, because those birds flying in the sky are indeed too free, too carefree. According to legend, Mo Di in ancient China used wood to make a flying kite. Long ago, many people in foreign countries also harbored this ambition. It is said that as early as 400 years BC, a Greek named Archytas, like Mozi, made a wooden dove that could fly in the air. But these are just legends, and it is hard to believe. Since the sixteenth century, many Western scientists have devoted themselves to researching flying tools. It wasn't until the end of the nineteenth century that someone fitted an engine to a light airship and completed the airship, which can be considered an amazing invention. However, airships still need huge gas bags, which are not very convenient. Therefore, later people worked hard to manufacture airplanes.

Since the mid-nineteenth century, airplanes had already been designed, but it was not until 1896 that the American Langey created his airplane model, which flew three-quarters of a mile in the air, that the airplane was officially invented. Now in our transportation and military, almost everything emphasizes airplanes. When we drink water, we should think of the source and remember Langey's merits.

Langey was a child from a poor family in Roxbury, Massachusetts. After graduating from Boston High School, he went to find a job. He went to Chicago to try his luck, wanting to become an engineer or architect. Coincidentally, Chicago had a big fire at that time, and many large buildings had to be rebuilt. So he smoothly obtained the job he expected. He worked for seven years and earned a lot of money. At this time, he was thirty years old. In order to gain further knowledge, he resolutely resigned and went to Europe to study astronomy. A year later, someone introduced him to work at the Harvard Observatory. He spent another six years here. He became tired of those books and many rigid theorems and formulas, so he left the observatory again and became an assistant teacher of astronomy and physics at the University of Pittsburgh. With his talent, he discovered infrared rays here and invented a calorimeter that could measure temperature changes of one ten-millionth of a degree.

He was not satisfied with this small invention. He still wanted to do an amazing career, so he chose the topic of airplanes. At that time, many scientists had failed in their research on airplanes, but he was confident that he would be a success. In his own laboratory, he built a very precise turntable to measure how much buoyancy the air had. As a result, he found that the numbers previously measured by scientists were all wrong. If a swallow wants to fly in the air without falling, it almost requires as much effort as a person. He was extremely happy, because he knew that with this precise number, his success would not be far away.

At this time, he had transferred to the Smithsonian Institution as an officer. But he still did not stop his interesting research. He planned to make a model to publicly test his results. This initial airplane model took him a lot of effort to build. But then another problem arose, which was the driving force. Should he use steam? Or air? Because there was no gasoline-burning internal combustion engine at that time, he finally chose to use steam power.

May 6, 1896, was a clear day. Langey took out his strange thing. The thing had big wings, about thirteen feet long, and was filled with a lot of fuel. Others were confused when they saw it. He took the thing to the Potomac River and turned on the engine. (Because he was afraid of falling and breaking his machine, he chose to test it on the water.) A sighing sound rang out, and this huge bird really took off into the air. The onlookers couldn't help but shout, and Langey was overjoyed. He did this test twice in a row. Each time, he flew in the air for one and a half minutes, and could travel more than half a mile, until the fuel ran out, and then slowly fell onto the water. However, no one was sitting on it. Because the whole machine only weighed thirty pounds.

This test naturally caused a sensation across the country. Langey was confident that if he made a larger airplane and carried people on it, it would certainly not be a problem. At the same time, scientists across the country also thought so. The Smithsonian Institution gave Langey 50,000 yuan to ask him to find a way to make an airplane that could carry people into the air.

Langey could now concentrate on making his airplane. How happy he must have been. It took him seven years of hard work, racking his brains, testing and testing, improving and improving. By 1903, the airplane in his ideal was actually made.

Still on the banks of the Potomac River, he was about to see a great iron bird carrying people into the sky. What a novel thing it would be! That day, scientists from all over the country came to stand along the Potomac River, and newspaper reporters even set up open-air tents along the river, ready to watch this unprecedented show. Although Langey felt confident, he really didn't want so many people to see him, but this news had already spread all over the country, and it was impossible for him to test it quietly and secretly.

The weather was a bit gloomy, but there was no wind. Langey boarded his self-made airplane in the applause. The applause grew louder and louder, and he couldn't help but get excited. But, unfortunately, when he had just taken off, somehow, the machine that helped him take off didn't work well, and it fell into the river all at once!

"It's clearly a joke! If people could fly, God would have given you two wings long ago!" These sarcastic words also spread from the crowd. Langey found it difficult to listen to. But he was not discouraged. He struggled to do a second test flight, but when he took off, he was too flustered, and a rope caught the tail of the airplane, and he and the machine were dragged into the water together. Langey was almost drowned. It was with great difficulty that he swam to the shore. When he looked at the airplane again, it had already been broken into pieces.

"Fool," "idiot," "daydreamer" This was the criticism he received after his disastrous test. His money was used up, and he wanted to ask Congress for a little subsidy to continue the test, but Congress did not agree. Langey was extremely frustrated, and he left this world in depression and curses in 1906.

Although Langey died, his invention was finally successfully tested by Wilbur Wright and Orville Wright in 1908. It's a pity that he died two years early and didn't get to see it!

Langey's airplane was displayed in the Washington Museum for ten years. Curtiss invented the internal combustion engine. He was moved by curiosity and wanted to test whether Langey's airplane could fly. So he installed a motor on the old thing and re-tested it in 1914. The result proved that there was nothing wrong with Langey's airplane. If there was a good engine and weather, it would not be difficult to fly for a long time. Since then, people have restored their faith in Langey, and his book on aviation mechanics is still a must-read for people who study aviation today.

### Cheng Ying and Gongsun Chujiu (Continued)

— Bi Yi

"A great man should die in the right place. What's the use of dying in vain?" Cheng Ying said.

Tu Anjia thought that the orphan of the Zhao family was really dead, and no longer sent people to the palace to check and monitor. Instead, he allowed Cheng Ying to calmly find a way to take the real orphan of the Zhao family out of the palace. Cheng Ying was afraid that Tu Anjia would find out, so he did not dare to openly raise Zhao Wu at home. He secretly took Zhao Wu and fled to Qianmeng Mountain. No one except Han Jue and Zhao's wife was allowed to know. Cheng Ying remembered the pain of his sister's death and took even more care of Zhao Wu. He lived in the mountains for fifteen years, and his life was as simple as that of primitive humans. There were no schools and no books. Cheng Ying served as both nanny and mentor, and painstakingly educated Zhao Wu into adulthood. Cheng Ying told him about the morality and achievements of Zhao Shuai and Zhao Dun, taught him how to follow in the footsteps of his ancestors and restore his family's business, and also told him that "the feud of killing one's father is irreconcilable." Zhao Wu and Tu Anjia were at odds with each other. Zhao Wu was a bloody child. Every time he was taught, he was moved to tears, gritted his teeth, and swore never to forget, especially when he heard Cheng Ying talk about the disaster in the Lower Palace and the death of Gongsun Chujiu.

When Zhao Wu was fifteen years old, one day, Duke Jing of Jin became seriously ill and suddenly had a guilty conscience, remembering that Zhao Shuo had died innocently. Just then, Han Jue entered the palace to ask about the illness. Duke Jing suddenly asked, "How were Zhao Shuai and Zhao Dun?" Han Jue knew that the opportunity had come, and hurriedly kowtowed and replied, "They were both first-class loyal ministers and first-class good ministers of the Jin state. It's a pity that loyal and good people like Zhao's father and son have no descendants in Jin!" Han Jue lost his voice and cried when he said this. Duke Jing couldn't help but shed tears either. After a while, Duke Jing asked, "Are there any descendants of the Zhao family left?" Han Jue immediately introduced Zhao Wu. So Duke Jing and Han Jue discussed establishing the orphan of the Zhao family. Duke Jing first hid Zhao Wu in the palace. When the officials came to ask about the illness, Duke Jing called Zhao Wu out to meet them. Duke Jing said to everyone, "This is the orphan of the Zhao family. His name is Wu. He is the grandson of Zhao Dun and the great-grandson of Zhao Shuai. The one who was killed by Tu Anjia in Shouyang fifteen years ago was a fake son, because Gongsun Chujiu wanted to preserve the real orphan, so he designed to replace him." The officials saw that Duke Jing solemnly introduced Zhao Wu and specially mentioned Zhao Shuai and Zhao Dun, knowing that he intended to establish a successor for the Zhao family. They were also happy to go with the flow and cater to Duke Jing's wishes, saying, "The disaster in the Lower Palace was entirely caused by Tu Anjia. He hid it from everyone and falsely claimed the king's order, so the officials could not do anything to him. We already know that the Zhao family was wronged. If it weren't for your illness, the officials would have already asked to establish Zhao's successor. Now that you have ordered it, it is all the officials' wish." Duke Jing was very happy and ordered Zhao Wu to thank the officials. With Duke Jing's consent, Zhao Wu immediately left the palace with Cheng Ying and led troops to attack Tu Anjia, killing Anjia and other family members of the Jia family who had participated in the conspiracy against the Zhao family. Duke Jing returned the Zhao family's original fields to Zhao Shi. Later, Zhao Wu was indeed able to inherit his ancestors' aspirations, become a general and a minister, and become a famous minister of the Jin state.

When Cheng Ying waited for Zhao Wu to reach adulthood and held the coming-of-age ceremony, he came out to bid farewell to the officials and said to Zhao Wu, "During the disaster in the Lower Palace, I originally wanted to die, but in order to establish a successor for the Zhao family, I did not die. Now that you have been established and have become an adult and restored your old position, my mission is complete. Gongsun Chujiu and I worked together. He helped me succeed with his death. If I alone greedily live, how can I be worthy of him?" Zhao Wu kowtowed and cried bitterly, begging, "Wu is willing to work hard all his life to repay you until death. How can you bear to abandon me?" Cheng Ying thought that he should die with Gongsun Chujiu and did not listen to Zhao Wu's words, committing suicide to be martyred. Zhao Wu mourned greatly and wore mourning clothes for him for two years. The Marquis of Jin thought that the righteousness of Cheng Ying and Gongsun Chujiu was rare, and buried them together in Yunzhong Mountain, calling their tomb the Tomb of Two Righteous Ones. The old people at that time who knew them both all said, "The appearance can be reliable, and it can be unreliable. Believing in the appearance will lose Cheng Ying; not believing in the appearance will lose Gongsun Chujiu: it is really difficult to know people!" (The End)

Publishing World

### "The Patriotic Movement of Students in the Song Dynasty"

— Tang Bin

The book "The Patriotic Movement of Students in the Song Dynasty" written by Huang Xianfan (published by the Commercial Press), is satisfying to readers in terms of materials, compilation methods, and social value. Most people think that the modern era is the beginning and flourishing period of the student patriotic movement; in fact, this is a very superficial misunderstanding. The source of China's student patriotic movement is quite long; as Huang Jun said in the introduction of the book: "China's student patriotic movement began in the Han Dynasty, flourished in the Song Dynasty, and recovered in the modern era. The historical records are obvious." His sentence is sufficient to correct the general misunderstanding of the origin of the student patriotic movement.

Why did China's Taixue student patriotic movement flourish in the Song Dynasty? Undoubtedly, this is because, in China's history, the Song Dynasty suffered more from internal and external troubles than any other dynasty. The powerful enemies of the Song Dynasty were the Liao, Jin, and Mongol states. They successively invaded China, occupied land, extorted money, bribed traitors, and framed loyal ministers; until the Mongols conquered China and destroyed the Song Dynasty. The Taixue in the Song Dynasty was in this environment of internal and external troubles. After deeply feeling the grief of national subjugation, they had no choice but to "submit memorials" and "throw pens to join the army" to carry out the patriotic movement. Huang Jun divided the reasons for the rise of the student patriotic movement in the Song Dynasty into four points: ㊀ The pressure of powerful enemies; ㊁ The weakness of court officials; ㊂ The arbitrariness of villains; ㊃ The assistance of public opinion. His insights on analyzing the causes of the student patriotic movement are very pertinent; and each point is accompanied by proof from classics to serve as the basis for his arguments. Therefore, after reading only the introduction of the book, we have a considerable concept of the student patriotic movement in the Song Dynasty.

Next, we can talk about the compiler's methods and content. The whole book includes four major parts: introduction, foreign affairs, domestic affairs, and conclusion; and the second and third parts contain several chapters, based on records of various historical books, to narrate the various facts of the student patriotic movement in the Zhu Dynasty. In addition, the appendix at the end of the book describes the Taixue system of the Song Dynasty and the life of Taixue students in detail. Therefore, in terms of the compilation method and the collection of materials, this book is just right.

As for the content, we think it is very exciting. The seven chapters of the Foreign Affairs and the eight chapters of the Domestic Affairs all describe the historical events of the student's patriotic movement, which can make people sympathize and excited. For example, the chapter "Chen Dong, a Taixue Student Who Submitted Memorials Eight Times," tells the story of Chen Dong running around for national affairs, submitting memorials, and finally being killed, which can most move readers. Chen Dong can indeed be called a model figure of Taixue students in the Song Dynasty. His adventurous memorials were entirely for the safety of the country, and his pure motives are admirable. For example, before his first memorial, he had planned this way: "If the memorial is successful and the court appoints me to an official position, no matter how noble and prominent, I will not accept it; if I am offended and die, I will not regret it. This is acceptable." His memorial behavior came from the national and genuine patriotism that citizens should have. The student patriotic movement in modern times, those who are in charge sometimes deviate from the right track, or are used by others, or are for their own benefit. If we compare such people with Chen Dong in the Song Dynasty, it is really a difference of thousands of miles.

The chapter "The Mongols Go South and the Strategies of Taixue Students" also describes the historical events of the Taixue student patriotic movement, which we also admire very much. For example, Ye Li and Xiao Gui submitted memorials to attack Jia Sidao; Dun Changzi submitted memorials to list "Six Strategies" and "Sixteen Strategies" to resist the Mongol army; three students in Changsha organized a student army and defended the city by force to resist the Mongol army, and eventually died after the city was broken, etc. These are all sufficient models for modern students. In short, the content of this book is very rich, exciting, and meaningful; this cannot but be attributed to the author's appropriate selection of materials.

Furthermore, the conclusion at the end of the book is very worthy of attention. In this chapter, the author explains the characteristics of the Taixue student patriotic movement in the Song Dynasty. He examines it from three aspects, namely: from the Taixue students themselves, there are the two characteristics of the bravery of the leaders and the consistency of opinions; from the method of implementation, there are the two characteristics of forming teams to petition and demanding classes; from the object of implementation, there are the two characteristics of persuading the monarch and attacking the prime minister. Finally, he also made a table of the achievements of the Taixue student patriotic movement in the Song Dynasty, which can be regarded as a very rare statistical material. In short, we have four feelings about this book:

㊀ Meeting the needs of the times
㊁ Well-compiled
㊂ Clearly explaining the true meaning of the student patriotic movement
㊃ Hoping for a book on the student patriotic movement in modern times

### "Discussion Collection on the Construction of Chinese Indigenous Culture" (Part 2)

— Ying Fu

In short, this article analyzes the content and methods of Chinese indigenous cultural construction very thoroughly; its arguments are based on the doctrines of the Mean and Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which are certainly very correct. Therefore, after reading this article, and then adding the concrete explanations of the Declaration of Chinese Indigenous Cultural Construction by Professor He, Fan, and ten other professors, we have a fundamental concept and a full understanding of the issue of Chinese indigenous cultural construction.

Secondly, we need to specifically introduce the Declaration of Chinese Indigenous Cultural Construction; because it is the object of discussion in the entire collection of articles, and it is also the starting point and the target of attack for articles of the anti-"Chinese Indigenous" faction. The advocacy of this declaration is as follows:

"Don't be conservative;

Don't blindly follow;

Based on Chinese indigenous, adopt a critical attitude, and use scientific methods to

Review the past,

Grasp the present,

Create the future."

From this slogan in the declaration, we can know that Professor He, Fan, and ten other professors produced the movement of Chinese indigenous cultural construction based on the lessons of our country's history and the current needs of our country. Moreover, their thoughts and advocacy are consistent with what Chen Lifu expressed in the article "Culture and the Construction of Chinese Culture"; in other words, they are based on the doctrines of the Mean and Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the training program of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the needs of our country's time and space, and are produced very correctly and naturally.

Finally, we can pay attention to the discussion articles of the anti-"Chinese Indigenous" faction. Naturally, the one that can represent the articles of this faction is Hu Shi's "Tentative Review of the So-called Chinese Indigenous Cultural Construction." Hu Shi holds a serious attack on the Chinese indigenous cultural construction advocated by Professor He, Fan, and ten other professors, and fundamentally opposes the eclecticism and conservative policies of the "Chinese Indigenous" faction. He divides the construction of Chinese culture into four items and repeatedly makes rebutting explanations, pointing out that they fundamentally lack understanding of the form of culture and are too poisoned by conservatism. At the end of his critical article, he made the following conclusion: "The inertia of China's old culture is really terribly large, and we don't need to worry about 'Chinese Indigenous.' Those of us who are willing to look forward should humbly accept this scientific and technological world culture and the spiritual civilization behind it, let that world culture fully contact our old culture, freely discuss and polish, and use its vigor and sharpness to eliminate some of the inertia and twilight of our old culture. The crystallization of the future cultural transformation movement will certainly be a Chinese indigenous culture."

However, although he opposes the "Chinese Indigenous" faction as much as possible and advocates the "complete Westernization" of Chinese cultural construction, unfortunately, his argument is too abstract and dogmatic, and it is expressed too weakly. This is indeed poisoned too deeply by blindly following Western civilization! In short, this collection of discussions has dealt with this major issue very deeply and thoroughly. Readers can easily find very satisfactory answers from those articles.

### How to Study Philosophy (4)

— Yan Yilin

Written by Wang Tefu, published by Sanjiang Bookstore

㊇ Summary of Philosophical Content: Philosophy is the science of studying the relationship between thinking and existence. Studying the relationship between thinking and existence means that this is studying how thinking and the outside world are related and how to achieve knowledge of the outside world, that is, the issue of epistemology. The so-called epistemology is the knowledge of how thinking knows the outside world. It has become the main object and material of philosophical research. It can be said that philosophical research is entirely built on epistemology, at least modern philosophy has taken the issue of knowledge as its entire content. Since epistemology is the entire content of philosophy, then when we have thoroughly studied all the problems it delves into, we have undoubtedly obtained knowledge of the outline of the entire universe and completed our worldview. When we say that we want to understand the world, we must at the same time ask how we should understand the world? This is the problem discussed by methodology. Its general content is the question of what means and how to understand existence. In this way, methodology should be a part of epistemology, that is, methodology should fundamentally be regarded as an aspect of epistemology to have significance. It cannot exist independently of epistemology. However, in philosophical research, in order to analyze philosophy concretely and to obtain specialized and exhaustive knowledge of each part of the problem, methodology can be regarded as a tool for knowledge and can be discussed separately, which is not improper. Another part of epistemology is ontology, which is regarded as the object of knowledge. The so-called ontology is the issue of existence in the proposition of the relationship between thinking and existence. "Existence" refers broadly to the entire material world. From the most basic elements that make up the universe to all the diversity of nature and society and even thinking, they are all external realities. They are the things themselves that we want to know. They are the objects of knowledge. In short, the outline of the general content of philosophy is like this: Epistemology is the main formation of the sum total of philosophy: under the main type of epistemology, it includes methodology that interacts with epistemology; at the other end of epistemology, it includes ontology or cosmology——because it is the existence factor at the other pole of the relationship between thinking and existence in the cognitive process, the cognitive process cannot talk about knowledge at all if it does not include the real entity and the real universe that exist, and there is nothing called knowledge.

As for the summary of philosophical schools, it can generally be summarized into two major opposing camps: idealistic philosophy and materialistic philosophy. The former believes that spirit produces matter, consciousness determines reality, and the objective belongs to the subjective; the latter is contrary to the former in every way, believing that matter produces spirit, existence determines thinking, and the subjective belongs to the objective. In addition, there is dualistic or pluralistic philosophy, which is mostly a fence-sitting eclectic philosophy, and in the end, it still cannot avoid falling into the realm of idealistic philosophy. This is actually a metamorphosis of idealism. In this way, philosophical schools are still just two major camps that discuss idealism and materialism.

### Giant Eurasia Airplane Flew Foreign Nationals out of Xi'an the Day Before Yesterday

Arrived in Zhengzhou the Night Before Last and Landed in Nanjing Yesterday Afternoon; Three Pilots Flew to Shanghai to Report

With the Xi'an Incident still brewing, the British, American, French, and German envoys stationed in China, to ensure the safety of their respective nationals residing in Shaanxi, chartered a giant Eurasia Aviation Corporation airplane on the 12th. The Eurasia company's chief pilot Walter, pilot Mencil, and co-pilot, flew the plane to Xi'an the morning before yesterday. Yang Hucheng's representative, Li Zhigang, also boarded the plane to return to Shaanxi. The plane arrived at the Xi'an airport at 4:31 PM on the 12th. Seeing the chaotic situation in the area, the pilots, to prevent unforeseen events, only stayed at the Shaanxi airport for three minutes to allow the foreign nationals residing in Shaanxi to board the plane. Then, at 4:34 PM, they left Xi'an, landing in Zhengzhou at 6:28 PM that afternoon to spend the night. They took off from Zhengzhou at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, arriving in Nanjing at 11:08 AM. All the foreign nationals who boarded the plane in Shaanxi disembarked in Nanjing. The three German pilots flew the plane to Shanghai at around 12:00 PM, returning to Longhua Airport at 2:10 PM in the afternoon. Aviation Director Walter went to the Eurasia company at around 3:00 PM to meet with General Manager Li Jingcong and report on everything.

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that an Eurasia Aviation Corporation Junkers airplane flew from Shanghai to Xi'an at dawn yesterday (the 12th), landing at the Xi'an airfield at 4:31 PM in the afternoon. It took off again at 4:34 PM and returned to Nanjing, staying only three minutes. The plane is stopping in Nanjing today and should fly back to Shanghai around noon, arriving around 5:30 PM in the afternoon. Therefore, no details have been ascertained. Li Zhigang, Yang Hucheng's representative who arrived in Nanjing last week, boarded the plane in Nanjing to return to Shaanxi. It is not known if he returned on the same plane. The other passengers were Eurasia's technical manager, Mr. Walter, the pilot, Mr. Mencil, and a co-pilot. After leaving Xi'an, the plane arrived in Zhengzhou at 6:28 PM in the afternoon, where they spent the night, and then flew to Nanjing at 7:00 AM this morning.

Today, Shanghai learned that seventy foreign nationals may leave Xi'an in the next few days and that the situation in Gansu province is slightly better than in Shaanxi province.

### Various Organizations Offer Sincere Advice to Yang and Yu

The Guangdong Native Place Association in Shanghai launched a donation campaign to aid Suiyuan when bandits and puppets invaded. All parties contributed enthusiastically. Currently, the association has exchanged 5,000 yuan at the Bank of China and delivered it to Chairman Fu of Suiyuan. Yesterday, the association received Chairman Fu's official receipt and a reply expressing gratitude. The original text of the letter is recorded below: "To the Guangdong Native Place Association in Shanghai: In response to your kind letter, the entire nation is concerned about the bandit invasion of Suiyuan. We have received letters and telegrams from all parties every day, offering material support or spiritual encouragement. We are deeply grateful for your exhortations. Considering that defending the border and resisting invaders is our duty, we are even more mindful of the heavy responsibility entrusted to us. We respectfully accept the 5,000 yuan donated by your association, which comes from your patriotic zeal and will be used to boost morale. We cannot decline your kindness. We can only follow your benevolent example and further encourage our troops to fight bravely on the battlefield. This sincere effort will also be a response to the generous gifts of our patriotic compatriots. In addition to informing all units at the front, we have specially prepared a receipt and sent it with this letter for your review. We will announce the detailed distribution plan in the newspaper once it is finalized to demonstrate our integrity. Thank you sincerely and wishing you all the best in your endeavors. Fu Zuoyi bows in respect." A receipt was attached, dated January 8th, 26th year of the Republic. The association also issued two important telegrams, one to the Central Government and one offering sincere advice to Yang and Yu. The original telegrams are as follows: "(1) To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: The Xi'an Incident has caused national outrage. Thanks to the prestige of our Central Government and the great personality of Chairman Chiang, it was quickly resolved, and the people are in awe. However, our Central Government's orders for the post-incident handling of Shaanxi and Gansu have been delayed by Yang and Yu for two weeks, and they have even telegraphed to assume the governorship of Shaanxi. Their intentions are clearly suspicious. We implore you to issue a clear order to suppress them to uphold the law and maintain the foundation of the country. The nation and the people rely on this. The Guangdong Native Place Association in Shanghai bows. (2) To Director Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou: The Shaanxi Incident has caused national outrage. The Central Government's handling of the matter is appropriate in both sentiment and reason. We hope that the national strength and local vitality will soon comply with the Central Government's orders. In times of national crisis, cutting off one's own path is not a wise choice. We specially telegraph this message to you. The Guangdong Native Place Association bows."

Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong's behavior of defying orders has become increasingly apparent. People from all walks of life across the country have sent telegrams to offer sincere advice. The Chinese Seamen's Party, the Chinese Seamen's Union, the Shanghai Seamen's Branch, and all the seamen's associations in the city, including those for midshipmen, cargo handlers, stokers, watermen, stewards, machinists, and helmsmen, also held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at the Seamen's Party Headquarters on Zhaojiabang Road, Ximen, to discuss expressing their views on the current situation. Under the leadership of Liu Huogong, Li Jianbai, Chen Yuanlong, and others, they resolved to: (1) Telegraph the Central Government to severely punish them; (2) Warn Yang and Yu to repent immediately and comply with orders. Also, the Shanghai Shipping Association of the Jianghai Steamship Company, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union, the Inland Affairs Office, and the Shanghai District Third Branch of the Seamen's Party and other seamen's organizations jointly telegraphed Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong yesterday, saying: "To Mr. Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Mr. Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou: We have learned that you are resisting orders with your troops. We pity you and worry about you. In this Xi'an Incident, the Central Government has shown great leniency in handling the aftermath. You should convert your sins into meritorious service, appreciate the Central Government's benevolence, and preserve your past achievements. Today, the people of the country hope for unification. Such actions will only isolate you from the people. We hope you will stop at the edge of the cliff and make a decisive decision to comply with the Central Government's orders as soon as possible to meet the expectations of the people. We offer this sincere advice and await your instructions. Signed, Wang Oumin, Standing Committee Member of the Jianghai Steamship Company of the Chinese Seamen's Association; Song Xiaoyun, Acting Director of the Inland Affairs Office of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union; Cheng Ying, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai District Third Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Special Party; and all workers and members." The Anhui Natives Mutual Aid Society in Shanghai telegraphed Yang and Yu yesterday, saying: "To Mr. Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Mr. Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou: We respectfully read the Central Government's orders for handling Shaanxi and Gansu. The various measures stipulated for military and political affairs consider both human sentiments and legal principles, and the painstaking efforts to plan for the country are exhaustive. You have served the Party and the country and are known for your achievements. If you can repent and convert your sins into meritorious service, and if the powerful neighbors see that the unification of our country is certain, they will retreat. Then, the great cause of restoring the country will be easy to achieve. If the Central Government sees that the lost children have returned, it will surely grant additional favors, and your reputation will be preserved. From now on, if we unite sincerely and work together for the benefit of the nation and the people, there will be epoch-making progress. Both the country and you will benefit. We hope that you will consider the lifeline of the country and the people, as well as your descendants, and not indulge in temporary emotions and disregard everything. The path is not far from the wrong one, so wake up quickly. We offer these weeping words and hope you will understand. The Anhui Natives Mutual Aid Society in Shanghai bows."

The group's activities in Shanghai yesterday were as follows:

Visiting Mayor Wu

Sixteen members of the group and their families went to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng at the Municipal Government at 9:30 AM yesterday. At the time, Mr. Wu was out on important business. The Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Yu Hongjun, received them. After about three quarters of an hour, they were accompanied by Section Chief Li Dachao and Councilor Zhou Yongneng to visit the library, public stadium, museum, and other places in the central area of the Municipal Government. The members of the group praised the new construction in the city.

Mr. Wu first expressed his gratitude for the warm reception given by all sectors of Guangxi Province to the Shanghai-Guangdong Industrial Inspection Group when they went to Guangxi. He then reported on the economic, financial, construction, and educational situation in the city, as well as the difficulties in the administration of the city. He also expressed his hope that he could visit Guangxi in the near future to inspect the progress made in Guangxi Province in recent years to satisfy his long-standing wish. He also inquired about the situation in Guangxi Province. They left the Municipal Government at 12:00 PM.

Visiting the Martyrs' Cemetery

They then went to Miaoxing Town to visit the Martyrs' Cemetery, paid their respects, and Zhang Renmin, representing the group, laid a wreath. They returned to Shanghai at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, had originally planned to host the group at the World Institute of Vocational Education at 4:00 PM yesterday, but the date was temporarily changed due to an unexpected matter. Since arriving in Shanghai, the group has been busy with social engagements and has not had time to visit the various factories and department stores. It is said that they will visit the major factories starting tomorrow. It is also learned that Garrison Commander Yang Hu of Shanghai has decided to host a banquet at 6:00 PM tonight to welcome the group.

### Drastic Drop in River Water Levels Raises Concerns About Disruption of Yangtze River Traffic

River Water Level Drops to Nine Feet One Inch; Jiangjing Runs Aground at Madang; Shanghai Shipping Companies Anxious

A telegram from Hankou yesterday stated that the river water level was even lower than the day before. On the afternoon of the 12th, the Jianghan Customs had already restricted all river steamers to loading to a depth of only nine feet two inches. Yesterday, the restriction was further reduced to below nine feet one inch. The draft of the empty ships of the six companies is between seven and eight feet. After loading fuel, water, and passengers, there is very little draft left. In fact, it is difficult to load any more cargo. The water level is slightly higher below Jiujiang, so navigation is barely possible. Therefore, large river steamers with deeper drafts, such as those of Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Nisshin Kisen, have been unable to sail the Hankou section. Even smaller ships have reduced their cargo shipments, resulting in huge losses for the shipping companies. Yesterday, the Sanbei Company received a telegram from the Xinpu, stating that the ship was unable to pass through the shallow waters due to the drastic drop in the river water level. The ship had completely refunded tickets to passengers and ordered them to take other ships. The ship can only return to Shanghai empty. In addition, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangjing ran aground at 7:00 AM yesterday in the Madang River area upstream of Anqing. Due to the sharp drop in water levels and the large number of passengers and cargo on board, the ship ran aground on a sandbar and was unable to break free. Captain Sun Fuge urgently sent out a distress signal, which was received by the company's Jianghua. The Jianghua immediately forwarded a telegram to the General Administration of Telecommunications, reporting the Jiangjing's grounding and requesting assistance from Shanghai. Upon receiving the report, the General Administration immediately sent a radio message at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, notifying all of the company's river steamers sailing upstream to pass through the Madang River area and quickly rescue the Jiangjing. If they could tow it out of the shallows, that would be best. Otherwise, they would have to first transfer the cargo and passengers from the ship before rescuing it. Furthermore, the company's Jianguo, which was sailing from Hankou to Shanghai the day before yesterday, ran aground in the river area below Jiaoshan in Zhenjiang. It took two hours to break free. Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs Patrol Service sent a letter to the company, requesting to interview the Jianguo's captain to inquire about the circumstances of the grounding, whether it was due to shallow water or the emergence of a new sandbar. According to the current situation, the water in the upper Yangtze River has dried up, making it extremely difficult for ships to navigate from Hankou to Yichang. The water levels in the lower reaches of the river are also dropping drastically, reaching the lowest recorded levels yesterday. If the weather turns colder, the water levels will drop further, which could completely disrupt traffic on the Yangtze River. The shipping companies in the city are extremely anxious.

### Chamber of Commerce Mediation Resolves Order Dispute

Longxingchang and Mei Zuishi Have Been in Litigation for Several Years; Three Agreed-Upon Solutions Reached

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Mei Zuishi Foreign Firm in this city had previously ordered 75 cases of "Three Circle" brand playing cards, 16 cases of "Double Five" brand playing cards, and 15 cases of felt hats from Longxingchang. Later, Longxingchang requested to terminate the contract because the "Three Circle" brand playing cards had a slightly yellowed edge and could not be sold. Mei Zuishi argued that Liu Yongkang, the owner of Longxingchang, had previously partnered to establish Zhengtailongchang, and the above-mentioned playing cards and felt hats were the goods ordered by Zhengtailongchang, which were unable to be cleared. Longxingchang then agreed to purchase them, without assuming responsibility for defects. However, the contract between the two parties did not include the words "purchasing the goods ordered by Zhengtailongchang," which led to the dispute. The case was brought to court. The first instance ruled that Longxingchang should clear the remaining stock at half price. The second instance ruled that the price of the felt hats should not be reduced, while the original ruling for the playing cards was upheld. The Supreme Court in the third instance ruled that the extent to which Longxingchang should reduce the price or whether the contract should be terminated should be determined by an appraisal and remanded the case to the High Court for a retrial. The High Court, considering the matter to be a commercial dispute, requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene a mediation. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce first sent staff member Yuan Hongjun to investigate the cause, and then convened Ni Xifang, the representative of Longxingchang, and the Taipan and Chinese manager Cai Binqing of Mei Zuishi Foreign Firm yesterday. Yang Guanbei and Sun Mingqi represented the Chamber of Commerce at the meeting. After repeated persuasion, three solutions were agreed upon: (1) Longxingchang is responsible for doing its best to promote and gradually clear the 74 cases of "Three Circle" brand playing cards. After they are sold, the Chamber of Commerce will convene both parties again to resolve the remaining amount. (2) Longxingchang is responsible for clearing the felt hats. Two cases should be cleared before February 10th of this year, and the remaining hats should be completely cleared by the end of March. (3) The Chamber of Commerce will record the above two solutions and send them to both parties to solicit their agreement. They must respond to the Chamber of Commerce by the 12th of this month. Both parties have now responded to the Chamber of Commerce, expressing their willingness to abide by the mediation solutions. Thus, the order dispute that had been in litigation for several years has been temporarily resolved.

### A Shallow Waterway Hinders the Dragon's Rise, Creating an Astonishing Record

Completing the Shanghai-Hankou Route in 56 Hours; Even Better Results Could Be Achieved if the Water Wasn't Shallow and Difficult to Navigate

The Three Northern Shipping Company's fast Yangtze River liner, the Dragon's Rise, sailed its maiden upriver voyage on the 9th of this month at 12:00 PM. Since it coincided with a major drop in the river's water level, its journey was closely watched by various circles in Shanghai and various shipping companies. However, upon reaching Jiujiang, the ship encountered draft restrictions. The Dragon's Rise had to transfer cargo, which caused an unexpected delay of up to twelve hours. Only yesterday morning did Shanghai receive a telegram from the ship, stating that despite the shallow water and difficult navigation, it had actually arrived in Hankou in 56 hours. The speed and the good results were considered satisfactory by all parties, and it broke the previous record for all Yangtze River vessels. If it hadn't been hindered by the shallow water, arriving in Hankou in 43 hours could have been realized. The details are as follows:

Discharging Cargo at Jiujiang

The Dragon's Rise arrived in Jiujiang at 8:00 PM on the 11th. Aside from stopping at Nanjing, Wuhu, and Anqing, the total Shanghai-to-Jiujiang journey took 40 hours, covering more than 450 nautical miles. If Jiujiang could have adhered to the scheduled cargo discharge time, Hankou could have been reached on the morning of the 12th. Unexpectedly, the water level above Jiujiang had dropped significantly. The Jiujiang Customs ordered that the ship had to comply with a restricted draft of 9 feet 6 inches before it could clear customs and sail upstream. The Dragon's Rise not only unloaded the Jiujiang cargo but also had to retrieve a large batch of steel bars bound for Hankou from the hold, starting at the Jiujiang pier. Furthermore, because the draft of the rear hold was one foot and six inches deeper than the front hold, making upstream navigation difficult, cargo from the rear hold was moved to the front hold to even out the load, resulting in a delay of up to twelve hours. Only at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 12th was it able to leave Jiujiang and sail upstream towards Hankou.

Obstruction by Jiujiang Customs

Both the Jiujiang and Hankou authorities telegraphed the company yesterday morning, stating briefly that the Dragon's Rise arrived at 8:00 PM on Sunday and that imported goods could have been unloaded within the prescribed time. However, after the Hankou iron bars were taken out, the ship's draft was still five inches short of the customs limit, and after leveling the draft, the Western Acting Assistant River Inspector at Jiujiang Customs deliberately obstructed the process, refusing to be flexible and allow early departure. Furthermore, Jiujiang Customs did not have any vessels to measure the water depth. After repeated negotiations, they finally agreed to allow the ship to sail upstream at 8:50 AM on Tuesday. According to Jiujiang merchants, flexibility is usually allowed for merchant ships, but this time it was truly unexpected. They should protest to the Inspector General of Customs to facilitate future voyages, etc. (The rest is omitted).

Safely Arriving in Hankou

The Dragon's Rise left Jiujiang upstream on the morning of the 12th, at a time when the river water in the upper reaches had dropped significantly. The initial draft limit was 9 feet 8 inches, followed by 9 feet 6 inches. Fortunately, the front and rear of the Dragon's Rise had already been leveled. In this most difficult section of the receding water, it was able to take advantage of its speed and arrive in Hankou from Jiujiang in a short time of 11 hours and ten minutes. Therefore, it arrived in Hankou at 8:00 PM on Tuesday. According to records, this upriver voyage, including the obstruction in Jiujiang, took a total of 68 hours. Excluding the time spent at the ports of Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang along the way, the total sailing time was 56 hours. With this result in this time of shallow water and difficult navigation, all parties were satisfied.

Meeting the Scheduled Service

The ship has been officially scheduled to depart from Hankou every Wednesday evening and sail upriver from Shanghai every Saturday evening. This arrangement allows for sixteen to eighteen more trips per year compared to the ordinary Yangtze River vessels of the Six Companies (ordinary Yangtze River vessels make thirty-four to thirty-six trips per year). Although the first trip encountered shallow water difficulties, it was still able to meet the scheduled service. Last night, the ship decided to sail downstream from Hankou and is expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow evening. It will depart from Shanghai as usual on Saturday. However, due to the shallow water, it may not be able to load as much cargo. On this first upriver voyage, first, second, third, and fourth class tickets sold for 1,820 yuan, and special class tickets sold for 680 yuan, not including freight charges. The downstream fare is yet to be determined. The ship's arrival in Hankou in 56 hours has created an astonishing record.

### Tenant Association Petitions for Clear Standards for Rent

Yesterday, the Shanghai Tenant Association submitted petitions to both the Ministry of Interior and the Municipal Government, stating that the petitions were to request the clear definition of standards for housing rents to maintain society and stabilize people's livelihoods. Since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai's commerce has been affected by the sluggish market, and the social economy has become even more depleted. Citizens living in this environment have no way to support themselves. The greatest oppression they face is the issue of rent. A few houses can easily cost several gold pieces, which not only hinders the revival of the market but also inflicts a fatal blow to the citizens. Various groups in Shanghai have been calling for rent reductions for several years, but there has been no concrete solution. The Shanghai Municipal Council convened a review meeting on December 30, 1935, on the establishment of rent standards. It was believed that according to economic principles, social development, and lower interest rates, the rent standard should be at the highest limit and should not exceed 10% of the land price and construction cost. This was passed and replied to the municipal government. Later, in February 1936, the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry held a joint meeting in Beijing to discuss methods for mediating rent disputes, and it was also decided that it should not exceed 12% of the annual interest on the total land price and construction cost. However, Shanghai's rents have remained the same since the January 28th Incident, even though the property market has plummeted. At this time, citizens are outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and finding a livelihood is difficult. If there is no concrete solution to the problem of "housing," it will have a significant impact on people's livelihoods. The association believes that establishing rent standards is an essential policy to revitalize the market and provide social relief fairly and impartially. Therefore, we specially submit this petition, requesting your department (government) to promptly handle property registration and clearly define rent standards. We are extremely grateful.

### A Tragic Story of Child Abuse after Believing a Stepmother's Slander

Eight Toes Rot Off

Yang Jinlou, living in the eighth household, third Jia, first Bao, Dongzhen, Tai Ri Town, Pudong, abused his seven-year-old son, Ah Rong, from his first marriage, after believing a stepmother's slander. He usually locked him up with iron chains, giving him only one box of rice a day, and at night he slept in a pile of straw without any cotton clothes, on the verge of death. The town's impartial people reported it to the town office, which sent a letter to the public security patrol station to rescue him. Yang Jinlou and his wife, Zhu, were arrested, and an iron chain and an iron lock were found. The child had not been washed for a long time, resulting in a dirty face and eight toes rotted off, a sight too gruesome to bear. He lay in bed all day, unable to sit or stand.

### Bandits Lurk on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway

Police and Bandits Exchange Fire Without Any Losses or Gains; Gatekeeper Lies About Daughter Being Robbed

At 6:40 PM last night, the Shanghai South Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway suddenly received an urgent alarm from Li Zegao, a gatekeeper from Haimen at the Luban Road weaving gate (according to railway regulations, this alarm is for major incidents such as damage to traffic, bandits hijacking trains, or train accidents). The night shift stationmaster immediately notified Guo Zhang, the section chief of the Shanghai-Hangzhou section of the railway police department stationed at the South Station, patrol officer Sun Duoliang, police chiefs Wang Deying and Zhang Zhenyi, Luo Bin, detective Xu Shibin, and a large number of armed railway police officers. They set off along the railway tracks, patrolling and splitting into two groups, heading from Kangqu Road to Luban Road, and from Xinqiao Road along the railway tracks. The officers and police patrolled and ambushed near the railway tracks on Xinqiao Road. They saw three suspicious figures in front, two wearing short clothes and one wearing a long robe. They ordered them to step forward, but the bandits opened fire and resisted. At that time, the officers and police were afraid of accidentally injuring pedestrians, so they fired shots into the sky as a warning, hoping to bring the bandits to justice. The two sides exchanged more than thirty shots. Fortunately, no one was injured. After a short time, the bandits knew they were no match and fled northwest towards Xinqiao Road. The officers and police found that the railway area had not been damaged, so they stopped the pursuit. At the same time, they detained two suspects near the railway line: Zhang Guozheng, 26, from Hefei, Anhui, residing at No. 69, Pingmin Village, Zhongshan Road, and Lu Bingshi, 23, a local, working at the Hengtaixing Glass Factory on Xinqiao Road. Both were taken to the South Station police section for temporary detention. Later, section chief Guo Zhang, together with the stationmaster, questioned the gatekeeper Li Zegao from the Luban Road weaving gate about the reason for the alarm. According to Li, he owed Yang Fu Chen Yu Kuan from Zhaofei Road membership fees. Chen gathered a group of people to demand the money, but Li was unable to pay. Chen then robbed Li's eighteen-year-old daughter, Fen Wan, as collateral. Later, Li also invited a group of people to rob his beloved daughter back. Fearing that Chen Yu Kuan would come back to rob her again, he was unable to resist, so he pressed the alarm bell and lied. Both gatekeepers, Li and Chen, were detained and a document detailing the situation was submitted to their superiors for review. The two suspects who were apprehended were released after it was determined that they were not involved. However, given the importance of railway traffic, it is difficult to fathom what bandits carrying weapons and lurking near the tracks at night might be planning. However, they are not related to pressing the alarm bell. The police department will pay close attention to this.

### 120 Representatives of Rickshaw Pullers from the Special District Petitioned at the Foreign Affairs Office Yesterday Morning

Due to the Large Number of People, Detectives Intervened, Fortunately Preventing an Accident; Six Demands Were Made, and Permission Was Granted to Forward Them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Handling

According to the New Sound News Agency, representatives of rickshaw pullers from the Shanghai Special District, including Lu Juede, Ka Changyuan, Wu Fuyuan, and others, a total of 120 people, petitioned at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at No. 6 Difeng Road at 10:30 yesterday morning. Due to the large number of people, detectives intervened, fortunately preventing an accident. As a result, five representatives were reassigned and allowed to enter, presenting six written requests. Deputy Director Zhao Tiezhang of the office received them and agreed to forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for handling. The representatives were satisfied and left. The original text of the written requests is as follows: ① Establish a Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Relief Association to provide relief to all poor rickshaw pullers in the Shanghai Special Districts One and Two, as well as the North and South Municipal Districts, the West Shanghai District, the Pudong District, the Wusong District, and other areas to achieve complete unification and be managed by the Chinese to prevent rickshaw pullers from being extorted and deceived. ② Establish compulsory schools for rickshaw pullers' children, designating four major areas in Shanghai and selecting locations where rickshaw pullers are concentrated in each area to establish school sites, at least four in each area, totaling sixteen, to alleviate the suffering of rickshaw pullers' children who are out of school throughout the city. ③ Establish charity hospitals for rickshaw pullers, at least three, so that rickshaw pullers can have access to medical treatment anytime, anywhere. ④ Establish rickshaw puller training centers to provide rickshaw pullers with good training, and establish sub-divisions for education, hygiene, recreation, relief, supplies, law, insurance, etc., to serve rickshaw pullers. ⑤ The source of funds is still to be raised from vehicle donations. In addition to paying the license fee, each vehicle will be charged an additional one yuan and fifteen cents to be used for relief to rickshaw pullers. All charitable donations will be allocated to the trade association for legitimate expenses on a monthly basis. ⑥ The above-mentioned funds of one yuan and fifteen cents are to be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau North and South Collection Offices for collection when vehicle owners receive their licenses, and a commission fee of one cent per vehicle will be deducted for collection.

### Heavy Fog in Shanghai Yesterday Morning

River and Sea Vessels Were Hindered

The weather in Shanghai has been quite clear recently. In the early morning, frost condenses on the tiles and corners, and everything is white. The ice in the ditches is quite thick, but the weather is clear (making winter particularly endearing). Yesterday morning, however, the fog was extremely dense, making it difficult to see clearly even at a short distance. Vehicles on the streets moved slowly. River and sea vessels experienced considerable delays in entering and exiting the port. The fog gradually dissipated after 9:00 AM, and water and land transportation resumed.

### Another Outbreak of Cattle Plague in Shanghai; Dairy Cattle Competition Postponed

Because the Participating Cattle Are All of Superior Quality, a Loss Would Be Enormous If an Accident Occurred

The Shanghai Dairy Cattle Competition, initiated and organized by the Shanghai Livestock Improvement Promotion Association, was originally scheduled to be held in the autumn of last year. However, due to various reasons, it was unable to be held as scheduled. It is now learned that the association has postponed the competition due to the recent outbreaks of cattle plague in Shanghai. All of the cattle participating in the competition are of superior quality, and a loss would be enormous if an accident occurred due to inadequate care. Therefore, it has been temporarily postponed and is not expected to be held in the near future.

### Blind Elderly Mother Lives in Misery; Children Neglect Her

She Went to Her Daughter's House to Beg for a Living, but Was Beaten and Driven Away; The Prosecutor Indicted Them for Insulting an Elder; The Case Has Been Concluded and Will Be Announced on Saturday

Shen Zhurong, the eldest son of the late temple merchant Shen Qin Yun (also known as Shen Wei Wan), residing at No. 24 Xicheng, Xicang Road, behind the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau in the city, married Shen Hu (small name Rui Zhu), the daughter of the blind old woman Hu Xu from Taicang. On the afternoon of December 19th of last year, during a heavy rain, his blind mother-in-law, knowing that her son Hu Zhonglin was at her son-in-law's house, went to ask for support. However, she was driven away and insulted by her daughter Shen Hu and Hu Zhonglin. Hu Xu then hired lawyer Liu Xiang to file a complaint at the local court prosecutor's office, accusing Shen Hu, Hu Zhonglin, Shen Zhurong, and others of assaulting a senior relative. Her wording was quite miserable, stating that she had been blind for twenty years after becoming a widow and that her children were all young. She had used her late husband's estate entirely to raise her children to adulthood. When her daughter got married, she spent as much as five to six thousand taels of silver on her dowry, and the cost of raising her son to adulthood was also enormous, leaving her with nothing. Her eldest daughter, Shen Hu, kept her son and second daughter, Ruiyun, from returning home to support her, leaving the blind old woman alone, stranded in Nanxiang, unable to make a living. Thinking that her own children would help her in her hunger and cold, she was helped by an old maid to Shanghai and temporarily stayed with her brother. On the morning of December 19th, she was helped by the old maid Hua Ji to her daughter Shen Hu's house to beg for a living. Unexpectedly, she instructed Hu Zhonglin and Shen Zhurong to beat her, drive her out, and call the police. The first defendant whispered a few words, and they ignored her. The prosecutor Li Fen ordered the defendants to post bail and attempt to reconcile with the mother, but after two court hearings, the children refused. The prosecutor then indicted Shen Hu and Hu Zhonglin for insulting a senior relative, while Shen Zhurong was not punished. Yesterday afternoon, presiding judge Lu Hongze held a hearing. Hu Xu requested that her daughter be ordered to pay twenty yuan per month, calculated for about twenty years, to repay the support fee of four thousand eight hundred yuan. If she does not repay the support fee, she should also repay the dowry of four thousand eight hundred yuan. Hu Zhonglin should also repay ten yuan per month for his birth expenses, so that the children do not live in luxury while the mother lives in poverty. The official then asked Hu Xu about the situation at the time, and she stated, "I asked my son for money, and my daughter cursed me as a lowly pig, said that what I said was nonsense, and that it would be better if I died sooner. She drove me out. She is rich and powerful and has forgotten her own mother." The prosecutor asked her to go outside to reconcile, but she said that she was cursed in this life. As for my son, he only cursed me once. I asked him why he didn't come to my birthday, and he said, "What's the point of celebrating such a miserable birthday?" So I can forgive my son, but I want my daughter to be severely punished." She then scolded the defendant's lawyer, Wu Qinyan, saying, "I call you my third sister-in-law, why are you helping my unfilial daughter to file a lawsuit?" The official, believing that the old woman was not maintaining order, ordered her to be helped out of the courtroom. Shen Hu, 28 years old, testified that she did not scold or drive away her mother, but that her mother was scolding and she stopped her from doing so. Hu Zhonglin, 24 years old, testified that he worked in a money shop on Doushi Street in Nanshi and earned only a little over ten yuan a month. He also did not scold his mother, nor did his sister drive her away. The official advised the mother and daughter to reconcile, but the daughter said, "They want money." The reconciliation did not match the facts. Hu Xu then said, "This daughter is as if she gave birth to my mother," so she could not reconcile. At this point, the defendant's witness, Han Dechun, testified that he did not hear Hu Xu being scolded, but that Hu Xu was arguing upstairs and downstairs, and then called a police officer and said that they had beaten her. Hua Ji testified that the insult was real. At this point, prosecutor Li delivered his opinion, and the defendant's lawyer Wu argued that Hu Xu's accusations had no evidence. The plaintiff's lawyer Liu said, "There are no bad parents in the world. The country governs with filial piety. If there is no clear conscience, how could parents falsely accuse their children?" The court declared the arguments closed and announced that the verdict would be given on Saturday.

### The Ministry of Industry Plans to Develop the Film Industry; Sends He Tingran to Europe and America to Negotiate Film Technology Cooperation

We Intend to Send Personnel to Hollywood to Practice Specialized Skills; He Is Scheduled to Sail Overseas to the United States on the 25th of Next Month, Then Transfer to Europe for Inspection; Last Year, the Revenue of Cinemas Nationwide Was Only Ten Million

In light of the sluggishness of China's film industry, the Ministry of Industry, in order to seek overall expansion, has specially sent He Tingran, a major figure in China's cinema industry, to Europe and America to inspect the film industry and negotiate technical cooperation with the United States. Mr. He is scheduled to take the Japanese Empress ship next month, the 25th, to start his journey. The reporter from the New China News Agency interviewed Mr. He yesterday to discuss the situation as follows:

Our Country Sends Personnel to the United States for Practical Training

The Ministry of Industry believes that the film industry has a great impact on enlightening the public, and also in light of the backwardness of China's film industry, it has specially sent Mr. He to Europe and America to inspect, so as to seek overall development and adjustment of the film industry after his return. According to Mr. He, he was ordered to inspect ① Hollywood in the United States to inspect its factory, photography field, technology, and other work, for a period of about three months; ② New York to investigate the American film management methods, etc., because the United States is the most developed country in the world, there must be many places to learn from. At the same time, we will negotiate with the United States to send personnel to Hollywood for practical training, so as to create highly skilled talents. This matter is extremely important for the future of China's film industry. After completing work in the United States, we will go to various European countries for inspection. First, we will go to the United States, because the United Kingdom also has a close relationship with our country. After the United Kingdom, we will decide on other itineraries. The estimated duration is six months, and it may be extended if necessary. If time permits, we also plan to participate in the Fifth World Film Conference to be held in Venice, Italy, in August this year.

Reasons for the Failure of Chinese Films

Mr. He also said that China's film industry is still in its infancy. Foreign films came to China around 1902, and domestic films began in 1923. The reasons for its failure are nothing more than ① The so-called actor's life is despised by the general public, so not many people invest and pay attention; ② It is still in its infancy, lacking specialized technical talents and capital. Since the Republic of China, the Chinese people's view of movies has indeed changed and it is regarded as a noble undertaking, but talents and capital are still a problem. At present, there are many reasons for the failure of China's film industry. This time, the Ministry of Industry pays attention to guidance, and there will be great results in the future. Recently, the pseudo-organization and South Manchuria Railway jointly invested 5 million yuan in the film industry, which has given us quite a stimulus.

Overview of Cinemas Nationwide Last Year

Mr. He has been engaged in the film industry for almost ten years and has founded cinemas in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou, so he knows the film industry very well. According to the report, last year's overview of the film industry nationwide stated that there were only about 200 cinemas in China, including entertainment cinemas. The annual turnover was less than 10 million yuan. Shanghai is the center of the national film industry. Recently, more cinemas have begun to use domestic films, but many still show foreign films. Among foreign films coming to China, American films account for the majority. Last year, there were about 300 films, accounting for about 90% of foreign film imports. The United Kingdom, Germany, and other countries also import, but in small numbers. Soviet films have a tendency to promote themselves to our country, but because the audience does not understand them very well, their sales have not been very successful. In general, foreign films have been operating in China for 30 years. Because the Chinese people are technologically backward, they have not competed with them, and there have been many loopholes.

Good Opportunities for the Development of Domestic Films

Foreign films have already made a lot of profits in China, but recently, with the rise of domestic films, and because foreign films have been changed to sound films, neglecting action and focusing on language, Chinese people who do not understand foreign languages feel that they are not as easy to understand as silent films, so many do not like to watch them, so the business of foreign films has also declined greatly, which is a good opportunity for our country to catch up. According to statistics, there are 10,000 cinemas in the United States and about 2,000 in Japan. China only has 200. In terms of population and land size, our film industry is still very small.

### Public Concession Health Department Warns Residents

Pay Attention to Influenza

The disease of influenza is now very rampant in Europe and the United States, and the number of deaths is quite large. This disease spreads extremely quickly, and it may soon spread to Shanghai. The Health Department of the Public Concession specially advises residents to take extra precautions. Residents who have a cold, especially when they have a fever, should rest in bed as soon as possible and take household medicines that are commonly considered effective. If bed rest is still ineffective, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible and avoid delaying treatment, so that an illness that could be cured in a few days does not become chronic. Residents should take precautions against colds, and the temperature in the room should not be too high to avoid dryness inside the respiratory organs, which makes it easy to get sick. When leaving a warm house, do not go outside suddenly without adding clothes. Also, add clothes after sweating and before bathing. Crowded and overheated places, such as cinemas, theaters, public vehicles, etc., are prone to injury to the nasal membranes, resulting in respiratory diseases. Residents should pay attention. Making a solution by mixing one teaspoon of salt into half a pint of warm water and using it to gargle or inject into the nasal cavity is a suitable preventive method. It is even better to use a mixture of olive oil or petroleum with a small amount of eucalyptus oil or other oily, peaceful antiseptic. When using it, tilt the head up and drip the medicine into the nasal cavity with a glass tube, so that it penetrates to the back of the throat. Wearing a gauze mask is beneficial to the nasal cavity, but residents may not want to use it unless the influenza is very rampant. It should also be noted that it is advisable to go to bed early at night during the prevalence of influenza to protect the body.

### Appeals Court Opens Investigation into Headless Trunk Murder Case

Lin Gendi Still Insists Mao Jiang Committed the Murder, But Witness Denies the Existence of Cai Ying

Following the sensational headless trunk murder case, the Hongkou Police Department's Chinese Detective Huang Linsen and others apprehended fireman number 650 Mao A'gen, number 231 Jiang Yuanli, and hostess Lin Gendi. The three suspects were sent to the First Special District Court. After several hearings, the court found that the defendants' statements were inconsistent and raised numerous doubts, insufficient to prove guilt. Consequently, Judge Zhong Qingyu acquitted them. The Municipal Council's Legal Department, dissatisfied with the verdict, filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court through lawyer Zhang Shizhu. The grounds for appeal stated that before her arrest, defendant Lin Gendi was overheard discussing the secret of Cai Ying's murder at the entrance of the Tongchangxiang cigarette paper shop on Carter Road. After her arrest, she also confessed that Mao and Jiang murdered Cai Ying. It is clearly stated in the law that confessions from accomplices that are detrimental to themselves should be admissible. Mao and Jiang claimed Lin was "thirteen points," a Shanghai colloquialism meaning someone who is not quick-witted, not someone with a mental illness. Throughout the interrogations, she was coherent. Forensic examination also found no evidence of any mental illness. The original trial court's sole reason to deem her testimony flawed was baseless. Furthermore, on September 25, the original trial judge, during an inspection of the crime scene, questioned the defendants freely at the Hongkou Police Station. They clearly confessed to the crime without coercion or deception. The original trial court's failure to adopt this evidence was improper. The appeal also cited ten points where the defendants' confessions matched the facts, such as Lin Gendi stating that the deceased Cai Ying's fingernails were stained red, which matched the red-stained fingernails of the discovered corpse, and the discovery of blood-stained bed boards and belts at 3 Cunfu Lane, as well as the time of the crime, all of which aligned. Based on these reasons, the original judgment was unfair and should be overturned, and the defendants should be punished accordingly. The Second Branch of the High Court initially scheduled a hearing for the afternoon of the 19th of this month. However, the High Court, needing to investigate evidence, sent Judge Xiao and Prosecutor Lin Wopeng to investigate the Criminal Division at 2 PM yesterday. Police lawyers and Mao A'gen's lawyer Fan Gang were present. Lin Gendi continued to insist that Mao and Jiang were responsible for Cai Ying's murder. However, Mao and Jiang continued to plead innocence. Ye Kuiyu, a resident of Cunfuxing Alley, and Yu Fengshi, a resident of number 2 in the same alley, were brought to court and asked if they knew anyone named Cai Ying who lived at number 3 Cunfu Lane. Both stated that no such person existed. Judge Xiao, reviewing the testimonies, adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 19th for further questioning.

### Pastor Throws Acid After Estrangement Following Wedding

Qin Gengtao and Pastor Wang Both Injured; Police Request Investigation to Determine the Truth Before Further Interrogation

Qin Gengtao, age 26, a native of Pudong residing at 26 Shoupin Lane, Ward Road, works as a salesman in a silk store at 58 Hong Kong Road. He is a devout Christian from a modest background. He was very close to Wang Baolü (age 58), a pastor from Yangzhou residing at 7 Sida Lane, Scott Road, who often provided financial assistance to Qin. After Qin Gengtao married a certain lady on the first of this month, he completely stopped visiting Pastor Wang. Pastor Wang visited Qin Gengtao's home several times, but was met with coldness and left ashamed. Wang has a peculiar condition and is prone to mood swings. Around 7 PM the day before yesterday, he took a bottle of nitric acid and went straight to Qin's house. Without asking any questions, he took out the acid and splashed it on Qin's face and head, causing severe injuries. Qin cried out for help. Wang also suffered injuries to his hands. Chinese Detective Shan Huitao arrived after hearing the commotion and took Pastor Wang and the injured Qin, along with an empty bottle, to the Yulin Road Police Station. Due to the serious injuries sustained by both parties, Qin Gengtao was sent to Sacred Heart Hospital, and Pastor Wang was admitted to the Police Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the Municipal Council sent the case file to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, charging Wang with intentional injury under Article 278, Section 3 of the Criminal Law. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the background and requested a seven-day postponement to investigate the truth of the incident, pending questioning after both parties recover. Judge Qing approved the request.

### Change of Contractor for the Bund Godown at China Merchants Bureau South Wharf

Regarding the change of contractor for the Bund godown at the China Merchants Bureau South Wharf, the Bureau originally ordered the previous contractor, Li Huanxin, to hand over the responsibilities by the 13th of this month. It is now learned that Li Huanxin has complied and transferred the contracting responsibilities for the godown to the new contractor, Qiu Dingzi, on the morning of the 13th.

### Lawyer Li Jichuan Accused of Seducing Neighbor's Wife

Li, a Lawyer, Violates Professional Ethics; Hearing Closed to the Public Yesterday

Lawyer Li Jichuan, courtesy name Huanyu, is originally from Zheng County, Zhejiang. He formerly resided at 80 Yongfeng Lane, North Sichuan Road, Hongkou. His neighbor at number 4, Jiu Geng Lane, was Feng Weichen, a Cantonese man nearly fifty years old. His wife had passed away early, and he remarried in the last month of 1933, taking a woman with the surname Qu, named Yin Song, as his second wife. Qu came from a modest family and had not received much education, but she was very beautiful. Because their residences faced each other, and Li's wife was also young and attractive, their families gradually started to interact. In their spare time, they would play games as a form of entertainment. Over time, even when Li and Qu met, they avoided any suspicion. Initially, they just chatted in private, but later, Qu started going out with Li, which Feng could not stop. Last autumn, Feng sent a letter to Qu's mother, asking her to discipline her daughter. Li then moved to 11 Lane 91, Zik Road, and Feng felt relieved, believing that their relationship could be ended. Unexpectedly, Qu continued to meet Li frequently, and Li's maid, named Ashu, often invited Qu out. Recently, Qu would often not return home all night. Feng became ashamed and sick. They became even more reckless, to the point where Feng could no longer tolerate it. He interrogated Qu severely. Qu then said that she was prevented from returning home by Li and that every time she went out, she would wait for Li at locations like the Jin Cheng, Da Guangming, and Hongkou Apartments, and then go together to a hotel for intimate encounters. Feng also found letters from Li to Qu. Li, as a lawyer, dared to seduce a married woman. The evidence was conclusive, not only violating national laws but also betraying the ethics of a lawyer, which could not be ignored. Feng hired lawyer Xie to file a criminal lawsuit for interfering with marriage against Li Jichuan in the First Special District Court, requesting punishment under Article 239 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan opened a hearing, summoning both parties and the witness Qu Yin Song. Because it was a scandalous case, many family members from both sides came to observe. However, Li Jichuan's defense lawyer, Chen Wenshuo, requested the judge to close the hearing to the public. Judge Pan granted the request, and all observers were asked to leave. After a long period of deliberation, the hearing was adjourned to the afternoon of the 20th of this month for further questioning.

### Wang Hanqing Still Absent in the Ye Fukan Case

He Submits a Letter to the Court Stating a Mistake; Arrest Warrant to be Issued if He Fails to Appear Again

The former judge of the Shanghai District Court, lawyer Ye Fukan, was accused by Wang Hanqing, a former detective in the Hankou Public Security Bureau, to the Ministry of Justice of embezzling a huge amount of property by taking advantage of his defense work. The District Court prosecutor released Ye Fukan on bail of 20,000 yuan and filed a public prosecution. During the trial, Wang Hanqing submitted a statement to withdraw the lawsuit, but he himself has been absent for a month, making it impossible to conclude the case. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Lu opened another hearing. Judge Lu said, "Wang Hanqing has sent a letter from the post office, again stating a mistake. What exactly does Wang Hanqing mean? This court has sent a postal notice to Hankou, ordering him to appear. If he does not appear, this court will ask the Hankou court to arrest Wang and bring him to Shanghai for questioning." The case was adjourned for another hearing.

### Summary of the Municipal Council's Administrative Situation in 1936

The Municipal Council's report summarizing the important administrative situation in 1936 has been prepared by the Secretary-General's Office and will be included in the Council's annual report. The key points are as follows:

(A) Housing Problem: The public concession housing problem is being studied by the 12 members of the Municipal Council Housing Problem Subcommittee. The entire committee holds meetings from time to time to discuss and integrate the research findings of each group.

(B) Factory Inspection: After years of negotiations between the Chinese authorities and the Municipal Council regarding the enforcement of the Chinese Factory Law in the Public Concession, an agreement was reached. The most important articles are as follows: Article 1 stipulates that "The Shanghai Municipal Council, entrusted by the Chinese authorities, agrees to implement the Factory Law and its implementing rules, as well as other related regulations, which have been implemented in the Chinese area and agreed upon by both parties through negotiations, within the Public Concession." Article 2 stipulates that "The Municipal Council shall establish a Factory Inspection Office, with inspectors appointed equally by the Chinese authorities and the Municipal Council." Article 6 stipulates that "The Inspection Office shall perform its duties in accordance with the Chinese Factory Inspection Law." Article 7 stipulates that "In case of violations requiring the enforcement of the Chinese Factory Law, lawsuits shall be filed with the court." Article 8 stipulates that "The Municipal Council agrees to submit reports to the Chinese government in a manner to be agreed upon separately." Article 9 stipulates that "This agreement shall be valid for three years, and either party may terminate it upon six months' notice to the other party." After the agreement was signed, the Municipal Council selected a delegation to review it. The consular corps expressed support for factory inspection but believed that the agreement should specify that it only applies to factories under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government, so that factory owners of countries with consular jurisdiction would not have their property rights infringed upon by factory inspections. The consular corps also indicated to the Municipal Council that if the agreement specified that the Municipal Council could, with the consent of the relevant authorities, implement similar inspections for other factories based on the powers granted by the Land Regulations, the consular corps would have no objection. The Chinese authorities expressed their willingness to continue negotiations and drafted a revised draft, but this issue has not yet progressed further.

(C) Amendment of the Land Regulations: The current Municipal Council Land Regulations were published ten years ago. During these ten years, the organization of the Municipal Council has undergone several changes, such as the addition of Chinese directors to the Board of Directors and Chinese committee members to the Land Committee. However, these changes have not been incorporated into the Land Regulations. Last year, the Municipal Council, in consultation with the consular corps, amended Articles 6, 10, and 18 of the Regulations to align with the current situation. The full text was republished in October.

(D) Consular Court: The appellate court for consular courts is the British Consul-General, with two judges, the Swiss Consul-General and the American Consul-General. Last year, a Chinese man named [missing name] died in a car accident, and his family sued the Municipal Council in the court, seeking compensation. The Municipal Council won the case.

(E) Cost-Saving Measures of the Municipal Council: In July last year, the Municipal Council established a Staff Economy Committee to consider how to save on staff expenses. The austerity plan proposed by the committee was approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors and implemented on July 1st of this year. This is expected to save approximately 1.06 million yuan annually. Prior to the committee's report, the Municipal Council had already implemented several cost-cutting measures, such as reducing fire equipment reserves, dismissing Chinese and foreign staff in the Fire Department, disbanding the artillery and light artillery teams of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and abolishing the Rickshaw Committee and the Intelligence Bureau.

(F) Parking Restrictions: Since October last year, the Municipal Council has implemented new parking restrictions, which have greatly improved traffic and parking conditions on the roads of the Public Concession.

(G) Other Matters: Other important matters for the Municipal Council last year included the resignation of Secretary-General J.R. Jones and Works Department Director W.T. Halberton, with F.M. Watson and G.G. Hempson succeeding them respectively; the enactment of boiler safety regulations; the implementation of new building regulations; the renaming of Tibet Road to Xizhaoqing Road in memory of Chinese Director Chu Zhaoching; the reorganization of the orchestra; the decision to reduce the number of public rickshaws; and the gradual implementation of new tram regulations.

### National Medicine Branch Raises Funds for Hospital Construction

Meeting Held Last Night to Discuss

After hosting a public banquet for the medical and pharmaceutical communities in the city to raise funds for the construction of the National Hospital of the Capital, the Director of the National Medicine Branch, Shen Zhongfang, Deputy Directors Ding Zhongying and Gu Weichuan, and Chairman Cai Jiping, convened a joint meeting of the medical and pharmaceutical communities in the city at the branch the night before last to discuss the matter. The following resolutions were passed: (1) On the matter of raising funds for the National Hospital of the Capital, it was resolved that each medical and pharmaceutical organization would be responsible for soliciting donations based on the "one-day donation" method, with the National Medicine Memorial Day on March 17 of this year as the day to collect the one-day donation. Donations would be made by medical colleagues, with those willing to donate more free to do so. However, the pharmaceutical representatives stated that their situation was different from that of the medical community and would be decided by the National Pharmaceutical Industry through public discussion. (2) On whether to approve the amended charter of the Chinese Medicine Rescue Team, it was resolved to approve it according to the amended charter. (3) [Omitted]

### Truth Behind Tang Zeyan's Suicide

Concubine Slanders Husband to Wife; Takes Poison After Pen Incident

Tang Zeyan, a native of Hunan residing at 1 Yiqing Lane, 631 Avenue Foch, committed suicide by poisoning on the 12th because his concubine, A Qing, slandered him to his wife, causing him resentment. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. Tang was 36 years old. He was originally a pattern maker with a good monthly income. He lived comfortably with his wife, Liu, at 14 Yongchen Lane, Xinza Road. Three years ago, Tang became involved with women and met the famous courtesan of Hanzhuang, Wen A Qing (26 years old, from Changshu), known as Xiao Qing Qing, one of the best of Hanzhuang's "four diamonds." Tang fell in love with Wen at first sight and wished to spend the rest of his life with her. Wen retired from her profession and followed Tang, living together at 2 Yiqing Lane, Avenue Foch. Tang gave her 100 yuan per month for expenses. However, soon after they lived together, Tang lost his job due to his obsession and could not make a living. Wen A Qing had no choice but to return to her previous profession, changing her name to Bai Niangniang, to support Tang. She also maintained close contact with Tang's wife, Liu, like sisters. However, the relationship between Tang and Wen was nearing its end, leading to disagreements and arguments. On the 11th of this month, Wen visited Tang's wife, Liu, and revealed Tang's shameful behavior of not seeking work. That night, Tang found out and blamed Wen for slandering him in front of his wife, leading to a conflict. Wen struck Tang, causing him resentment and leading him to take his own life the next morning at 9 AM by secretly swallowing four boxes of raw opium. At 10 AM, Wen discovered him and told his friend Chen Zuxi, who called a doctor to pump his stomach, but it was ineffective. He died at 2 PM that afternoon. Wen A Qing, fearing punishment, hid away. Chen Zuxi reported to the police, who took the body to the morgue. Yesterday, prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court and a forensic doctor went to the morgue to examine the body. Tang's wife, Tang Liu, signed to claim the body for burial. It is said that Tang's wife, Liu, suspects Wen A Qing of forcing her husband to his death and will file a lawsuit against Wen.

### Xu Xueseng Case Cannot Be Withdrawn

Defendant's Lawyer Says Xu Has Run Away; Due to Inability to Deal with Thugs

Xu Xueseng, former Director of the Gansu-Shaanxi Opium Prohibition Bureau and county magistrate, had nitric acid thrown on his face in March of last year by the gangster Gao Jinsheng on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession, disfiguring him. The French Concession police arrested Gao and handed him over to the First Special Court, which sentenced him to four years. Xu also filed a lawsuit in the District Court against his sworn brother Zhu Guanghan, a wealthy man from Songjiang, and Chen Axi, from Suzhou, accusing them of inciting the assault. Zhu also hired lawyers Gu Changyuan and He Xianzhang to argue that he was falsely accused due to a loan dispute. The case caused a stir, and after multiple hearings, Xu Xueseng unexpectedly submitted a statement to withdraw the lawsuit, and he himself did not appear in court. However, as the case was not subject to private prosecution, Judge Liu Bojun summoned the parties for questioning again yesterday afternoon. Wen Chao, the lawyer entrusted by Xu Weiseng from Dangshan, appeared in court and said that after the hearing on December 26, the plaintiff had not come. The lawyer received a notice to review the file and only learned from the newspaper the next day that the plaintiff had submitted a statement to withdraw the lawsuit. The reason was unknown. Therefore, the agent argued that if the plaintiff did not appear, he should be arrested in accordance with Article 219 of the Criminal Procedure Law, or, if necessary, the prosecutor should be asked to take over the lawsuit in accordance with Article 223 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The judge said, "This case cannot be withdrawn." The lawyer replied, "The lawyer had people go to the plaintiff's house, and they said he was not home." The judge said, "The statement says that the case was withdrawn voluntarily." The lawyer replied, "If the plaintiff did not withdraw it himself after the newspaper reported it, he should declare it to the court." At this point, the defendant's lawyer said, "The plaintiff ran away because he could not deal with the many thugs who demanded payment. His withdrawal was his own intention, and the agent cannot change his claim." The judge said that both parties need not argue and adjourned the hearing to summon the plaintiff for questioning again. If he did not appear again, the decision would be made according to law.

### Monk Mingrun Sues to Confirm Master-Disciple Relationship

Fearing Difficulty in Inheriting Property if Old Monk Passes Away; But Defendant Claims No Denial, Therefore No Confirmation Needed

Zhenkui, the abbot of the P陀山三聖堂, aged 67, has a branch temple in the Public Concession of Shanghai, named Taiping Temple. In 1920, Zhenkui accepted the monk Mingrun (from Zheng County, aged 63) as his disciple. Recently, Zhenkui has not allowed Mingrun to live in the Taiping Temple and has even indicated that he does not recognize Mingrun as his disciple. Mingrun has hired lawyer Gu Jirong to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment confirming that the plaintiff is a disciple of the defendant Zhenkui. The reasons for his lawsuit are that the plaintiff became the disciple of the defendant in 1920. The defendant is the abbot of the Putuo Mountain Temple and has a branch temple in Shanghai, named Taiping Temple. Because he has developed extensive connections with good people and is good at accumulating wealth, he is rich. The defendant is now old, and the plaintiff is his only disciple. If he passes away, many people will covet his assets. If his status is not clarified first, there will be endless troubles in the future. The defendant is prejudiced against the plaintiff and does not allow the plaintiff to live in the Taiping Temple, which violates the etiquette of ordination. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Xu Fuji opened Civil Court 12 and summoned Zhenkui, who hired lawyer Chen Ying to appear in court. According to his defense, the fact that the plaintiff is the defendant's disciple is undisputed. However, the plaintiff's behavior is improper, and he severed the relationship in 1929. The plaintiff's lawsuit is completely without merit. Since the defendant has not denied his identity, there is no need to confirm it again. Moreover, the defendant's purpose is solely to inherit property. Inheritance has its own inheritance laws, and since inheritance has not yet begun, it is even less relevant. He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Judge Xu reviewed the information and concluded the debate, scheduling a date for sentencing.

### Two Girls Rescued from Dalian and Returned to Shanghai; Kidnappers to be Interrogated Yesterday

Miss Zhang handed over to family, Miss Zhu sent to Ji Liang Institute; Court to schedule special hearing due to complex case

Zhang Fengying, a 14-year-old girl from Wuxi, came to Shanghai last winter to stay with her relative, Zhu Juzhen, her aunt, at 21 Maohai Road, seeking employment as a female worker. On November 7th, Miss Zhang suddenly disappeared. Zhu searched everywhere without success and reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station. Subsequently, Chinese detectives Feng Qishan and Xia Shutang arrested two suspects from Changzhou, Liu Fengsheng and Zhang Changbao. Upon interrogation, it was learned that Miss Zhang was taken to Qingdao for sale by accomplices from Yangzhou, Ling Dedang and a person named Xiao Yu. Detectives Feng and Xia, along with Western detective Airdis, went to Qingdao's Chaoyang Road, Sanyi Tai, Huaxing Public Inn on Yinxi Road, and a brothel opened by Le Baoshan at 12 Zhiergou, Sifangwei, Dalian, successively apprehending six accomplices from Yangzhou: Lü Jiadong, Yu Runzhi, a woman Zhang Chenshi, and from Anhui: Bao Zishan, from Shandong: Ma Gongchen, and Ling Defu. Miss Zhang Fengying was found in the brothel, along with Zhu Xiuying, a 21-year-old girl from Huzhou (who was also kidnapped from Shanghai to Qingdao). Miss Zhang was taken back by her aunt, Zhu Juzhen. As Miss Zhu had no family, she was temporarily sent to the Ji Liang Institute. Lü Jiadong and his gang were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. During the postponement of the case, Liu Zhao's mother, Liu Zhaoshi, was arrested at 210 Tangen Road. It was determined that she was employed as a servant at Zhu Juzhen's house at 21 Maohai Road, and Miss Zhang was abducted by her. Yesterday morning, the police sent the nine male and female suspects, including Liu Fengsheng, Lü Jiale, and Liu Zhaoshi, to the Criminal Section of the Public Works Department, represented by lawyer Zhang Tianyin. It was stated that upon investigation, Miss Zhang Fengying was lured out by the defendant Liu Zhaoshi, who then conspired with the defendants Zhang Fengsheng and Zhang Changbao. Afterwards, they found the defendant Ling Defu and the fugitive Xiao Yu, who accompanied the girl by ship to Qingdao. En route, they happened to meet the defendants Lü Jiale and Zhang Laowu. Zhang had already lured Miss Zhu Xiuying and was also on the ship. Zhang Laowu and Ling Defu were identified as leaders of two gangs specializing in the sale of women. After arriving in Qingdao, they resided in a hotel, where Lü Jiale and Ling Defu found the defendants Wang Runzhi and Bao Zishan for a meeting. The defendant Ma Gongchen, the assistant manager of the Sanyi Tai Hotel, contacted his friend Le Baoshan. Le's wife ran a brothel at 12 Zhiergou, Dalian. Miss Zhang was sent to the brothel in Dalian by the defendant Zhang Chenshi and handed over to Le's wife. The proceeds were distributed by Ma Gongchen. Miss Zhu Xiuying suddenly fell ill at the hotel in Qingdao and did not go to Dalian. According to Miss Zhang, in the Dalian brothel, due to her youth, she was unaware of the rules for receiving guests, so she remained in the brothel to learn and had not been deflowered. However, after being lured out by Liu Zhaoshi, (1) at the Baoan Hotel on Shanxi Road in Shanghai, (2) at the Huayu Public Hotel in Qingdao, the defendant Ling Defu twice attempted to rape her without success and injured her lower body with his fingers. Doctors at Renji Hospital examined Miss Zhang and found that her hymen was slightly torn. Miss Zhu had been a prostitute at a brothel on Jiujiang Road. She had no family and wished to stay at the Ji Liang Institute to study and no longer be a prostitute. After hearing the testimonies of Miss Zhang and Miss Zhu, Judge Zhong Qing determined that the case was complex and required considerable time for questioning. He ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and scheduled a special court hearing on the 19th at noon. Miss Zhu was allowed to stay at the Ji Liang Institute for care. Xiao Yu, who was still at large, turned himself in, standing near the gate of the Third Court, listening for news. Miss Zhang spotted him and notified Detective Feng, who arrested him. His real name was Yu Junqing, 25 years old, from Changzhou, working as a clerk at a hardware store at 7 Yuanheng Lane, North Zhejiang Road. He was dressed in a Western suit and leather shoes, and wore gold-rimmed glasses, resembling a student. His name was added as the tenth defendant, and after a brief interrogation, he was detained to await a combined hearing.

### Chen Zhongqun's Fiftieth Birthday

No Ceremony Held, Birthday Gifts Used for Charity

Today is the fiftieth birthday of Chen Zhongqun of Fenghua. Relatives and friends, recognizing Mr. Chen's enthusiasm for public welfare and service to society for nearly thirty years, originally intended to hold a celebration. However, Mr. Chen declined. Therefore, no ceremony was held. All birthday gifts were entirely transferred to charitable organizations such as the Ningbo Qichang Educational Institute, the Yinxian Relief Home for the Disabled, and the Yinxian Relief Home Educational Institute. These three organizations have achieved remarkable results in education and care, but they are struggling financially and unable to expand. This has been a concern for Mr. Chen. Relatives and friends fulfilled his wishes by initiating this action, which greatly benefits the local community. As a result, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, which served as the gift collection point, has been very busy these days.

### Weather Report

### Removing the Police Bells

— Shi Weizhi

The great fire at Xidan Arch in Beijing, because "various businesses suffered excessive losses, especially small businesses and vendors, who suddenly felt the pain of bankruptcy and unemployment, their livelihoods cut off, their situation extremely miserable," has clearly become a serious social problem again. How this serious social problem will be resolved and what relief will be offered, we are willing to see the facts later, and we do not want to interfere here. As for the cause of the fire, there are now "various rumors, with no consensus." "The night watchman was already drunk and asleep, and did not perform his duty of striking the watch," and the police in the area also "delayed reporting after discovering the fire." These are not worth mentioning. Let's just say that because the police bell tower failed to report the fire in a timely manner, the Beijing municipal authorities are preparing to demolish the "old and dilapidated" large police bell tower. The original text is copied below:

The city of Beijing originally had four or five large police bell towers to report fires, towering into the sky, with fire police stationed day and night to keep watch. Unexpectedly, in this Xidan Market fire, because it was in the middle of the night, the police bell tower failed to detect and report the fire in a timely manner, causing the fire brigade to arrive slightly late, resulting in an unmanageable disaster. Afterwards, the local authorities, considering that these police bell towers were mere shells, difficult to achieve practical results, and that each tower was old and dilapidated, posing many dangers, decided to demolish them all in the coming days.

The police bells in Beijing are "old and dilapidated" and pose many dangers, which is probably true. Because they "failed to detect and report the fire in a timely manner, resulting in an unmanageable disaster," they are said to be "mere shells," which is also natural! But who should bear this responsibility? The police bell tower? The police bell tower is a dead object. Without someone striking the bell, it will not ring by itself, which is very clear. Yet now it is said to be demolished because it is a "mere shell."

Demolishing them will naturally be clean and tidy, saving them from posing many dangers. However, even this equipment that can report fires will be gone, which is also quite obvious.

Perhaps it is said that after the demolition, a new one will be rebuilt. If so, that is naturally good. But judging from the tone of the communication, I am afraid that is not the case. Although the news is often incomplete or inaccurate, the fact that it says "demolish them all" instead of "demolish and rebuild" cannot help but make people suspect that there are facts beyond the news.

Taking temporary pleasure, the police bells are demolished because they are "mere shells." This might be justifiable, but why are they "mere shells"? That is too "meaningful." Not feeling that they are "mere shells" before the fire at Xidan Arch, but only feeling after the fire that they are not only "mere shells, difficult to achieve practical results," but also knowing that they are "old and dilapidated, posing many dangers," and after knowing that they are "mere shells" and "old and dilapidated," not wanting to repair them and make them live up to their name, but only wanting to demolish them, the degree of confusion can truly be said to be "amazing."

Even if it is said that after the old police bell towers are demolished, new police bell towers will be built, but if the person in charge is incompetent, the new police bell towers will also be "mere shells." For example, the night watchman at Xidan Market was not drunk and asleep, failing to perform his duties? And the police stationed nearby also "delayed reporting after discovering the fire." Even if the police bell tower is renovated and brand new, the bell will not ring on its own. It will probably be the same. In that case, demolishing it will be clean and tidy.

### Crossing the Border

— Ruizhi

The morning sun, without any warmth, floated up from below the horizon of the harbor, its weak red light shining on this island city just waking up from sweet dreams. Perhaps some wealthy people are still having warm, pleasant dreams, but the wharves by the sea are already crowded with people. At this time, I also carried a small bag, walked out of the hostel gate, and headed towards the ferry for crossing the sea.

The morning wind blew fiercely on the sea surface, sweeping across my face in gusts, the cold air stinging my face until it turned red. At this time, looking back at the island city under the morning sun from the ferry, I felt it was a different sight. Everyone praises the beautiful night view of this island city, but the winter morning scene, with the yellowed trees and grass painting a pale yellow color, and the pale red sunlight shining on it, makes it look like a golden pyramid made of gold, with the white and red houses like countless jewels adorning it, emitting colorful light. Isn't this an extremely beautiful scene? However, for this beautiful island city that has lost its territorial rights, I can only part with it temporarily.

The ferry docked, and I was squeezed out of the wharf by the crowd, and then squeezed into the train station.

The clock on the station wall pointed to 7:45. I took the third-class carriage of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway for the first time. The carriage was already crowded with people. Finally, I found my seat in a corner. At this time, the train was already moving with a rattling sound. In an instant, looking back at the Kowloon Station in Tsim Sha Tsui, it was vaguely like being immersed in green seawater.

The third-class carriage is the most chaotic, but also the most free, because the people sitting here are all freedom-loving people who do not understand hypocritical etiquette. Although the rude conversation can be annoying, in this environment, everything is free, which can reduce a lot of loneliness during the journey.

The train ran on the plains. At this time, what appeared in front of me was the desolate winter field. The white villages, like dots, silently flew past the window. In the fields, very far away, there were only one or two figures walking diligently, or a cow resting under a dead tree, or one or two pairs of wild dogs barking madly at the train. In short, the winter countryside is peaceful. The train has been running on the plains for more than an hour, but the flat asphalt road on both sides of the railway has been running side by side all the time. The trees on both sides of the road, withered, appear more straight and dense. Such suburban roads have not been found in our territory.

Seeing that the train is about to cross the border, the large circle made of stone on the distant mountain peak is telling us that crossing the mountain is our national border. The speed of the train slowed down. Looking out the window, the surrounding fields and hillsides are full of countless low, white spots made of stone. Those are the defensive pillboxes.

The train entered the platform of the last station on the border. At this time, a large group of patrolmen squeezed onto the station. They were quickly inspecting the passengers in the carriages with rude curses and fierce batons. The first and second classes seemed to have passed safely, while in the third-class carriage, some old villagers were hit by the batons. When the train started, someone said, "Foreign devils, are third-class passengers not human? Damn it..." After a commotion passed, the train had already crossed the border.

This was my first time taking the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, but what I saw was forever etched in my memory, especially when crossing the border.

### Old Shandong

— Hun

At the entrance of the hotel was a baked sweet potato stall. The stall was run by an old man, wearing a worn-out old sheepskin jacket, the bottom of which was longer than his knees, as if it were a short cheongsam that women used to wear. He wore a worn felt hat, high-top boots, and a foot-long dry tobacco pipe was slung diagonally on his belt. This attire made people know at a glance that he was an old Shandong. However, he could speak fluent local dialect, and he himself was very proud of his cleverness. He said: No matter where he lived, as long as he lived there for three months, he could speak the language of that place. However, since the current owner took over this hotel, no one had seen the old Shandong leave this place, and it had been seven or eight years.

There must be a reason for this. No one knows when the old Shandong came to this place. The reason why he refused to leave this place was for a woman. That woman was a famous shrew in this place. She was a single woman, quite capable, and could do anything, some of which even men were daunted by. Because she was fierce, stubborn, and skilled at fighting and arguing, no one ever dared to joke with her or take verbal advantage of her. No one knows what kind of fate brought her together with the old Shandong. This sweet potato stall was also her domain, conquered by her fists, and now she let the old Shandong do it, while she herself enjoyed happiness in a self-built thatched hut.

The old Shandong seemed to be a layman in doing this business. In the morning, he went to the fruit shop to weigh sweet potatoes, and often he paid the most expensive price and bought the worst goods. Washing the mud off the sweet potatoes in a wooden bucket also took a lot of time. Sometimes the oven for baking sweet potatoes would burn a large pile of rotten newspapers. But he also had a skill: his sweet potatoes were sold at the most expensive price. Because those who came to this hotel to drink yellow soup were all old drunks. They stepped into the hotel when the sun was high and drank until the shop was closing, as if they had never thought of eating except for drinking. Baked sweet potatoes often became their snacks with wine. However, the reason why the old Shandong raised the price of sweet potatoes was not this reason. The real reason was that this hotel had never sold dishes since it opened until now.

Baking sweet potatoes is only done in winter. On other days, the old Shandong's business was even bigger: peanuts, water chestnuts, arrowhead, the old Shandong knew very well what season to do what. Although each business was not very savvy, selling at the most expensive price was the same.

Those drunks were originally very shrewd. At first, they thought that the old Shandong's deliberate raising of prices was the shrew's idea. They often took the old Shandong's goods without paying, and only paid him when he reduced the price to the lowest amount. Because every day at closing time, the woman often argued with the old Shandong about how much business he had done, and did not allow her husband to use a penny more. In this way, those drunks had a good show to watch every day. When that woman found out that there was a shortage of money, she would grab the old Shandong's belt and roll around on the ground. But there were also times when things were calm, even though many people deliberately paid less that day.

One day, the old Shandong got drunk. When a drunk pretended to be that woman rolling around on the ground to mock him, he stuttered out a secret.

The old Shandong himself was also a drunk. He had to drink one or two hundred cash worth of wine from the shop every day, nesting the wine bottle in his chest pocket, drinking a mouthful every now and then, and the snacks were readily available. The money he spent on wine was the extra money he made from the higher prices. Because the woman only came to settle the accounts at closing time every day, she did not know that the old Shandong, who was not savvy in anything, made money from this aspect to drink. So the old Shandong finally seemed to beg those drunks:

"You guys also do a good deed! If you give me less money, I won't have enough to drink. That bitch is really fierce!"

This drunken remark was greeted with a burst of laughter. And after that, when the old Shandong went to buy wine, some people straightened their throats and demanded that the old Shandong sell them several dozen cash worth of peanuts or other things on credit to scare him. But no one really did this. They still gave him the original price. They were willing to spend a few pennies to help the old Shandong hide it from that woman.

The old Shandong still drank one or two hundred cash worth of wine every day. That woman, on the other hand, never rolled around anymore. She happily collected the money every day and escorted the old Shandong, her husband, home.

Central West (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM

Opening "Shen Fengxi"

Withered spring breeze, graying temples. Who recognizes the old, wandering beauty? Selling art on Tianqiao to barely make a living. How pitiful she is, suffering hardship in her declining years. Playing the strings sadly, recounting her life. A song of sorrow, breaking the heart. She unexpectedly met the young Master Fan, a connoisseur of music. Deep affection, yet unspoken. Who knows that good things are always envied? Endless sorrow, evil winds and waves. Don't blame the impoverished Three-String Uncle. Only blame the two words "vain glory" that bewitched him. Since ancient times, gold can buy smiles. But a beauty's heart is hardest to fathom. How laughable, singing of longing in Yangguan Melody. Ten rounds of sorrow, tears filling his eyes. Who knows, once entering the gate of a noble family, it is as deep as the sea. The general's power is indeed towering. But seeing the dazzling jewels, her heart is first intoxicated. Completely abandoning old affections, like tossing them into the blue sand. How could she care about vows and betrothal gifts? How pitiful she is, with a foolish heart beyond saving. How pitiful he is, with a mismatched fate, trapped in a cocoon. Only left with a desolate fan, broken in the autumn wind. Moaning in sickness, crying out in despair. Suddenly crying, suddenly laughing. New sorrows and old dreams, flickering shadows. Unable to forget the handsome young master from the turbid world of Qiantang. Unable to forget the white-haired mother's tears like a shuttle. With tattered willows and broken remnants, there is no other love. How can she compare Tianqiao's fallen beauty to filling the Milky Way with magpies? In the vast sea of sin, there is endless hatred. Throughout the ages, beautiful women have suffered ill-fate. The lingering sound echoes in the south village.

Opening "Xi Xiang Ji Playing the Qin"

Fragrant lotuses and clear waters, a cool breeze stirs. Water stirs, the breeze cools, a long summer day. Long day of summer, fragrant lotuses. Miss Yingying calls out Hongniang. Bored in her boudoir, feeling lonely. To dispel her melancholy, she enters the garden. Flower-lined corridors, winding paths. Gently lifting the gauze window, shielding the sun. A red railing curves over the nine-bend bridge. A green gauze window by the lakeside pavilion. The young lady leans against the railing, watching the water. Seeing two mandarin ducks playing in the pond. Hongniang pushes open the green gauze window. An incense table placed in the center. Incense burned in the censer. The qin taken out of its bag. Yingying sits down and tunes the strings. First she plays "Xiangfei's Lament." Then she plays "Phoenix Seeking Its Mate." The melody of "Thinking of Home" is particularly sad. Several tunes have been played. The red sun is gradually setting. Little Hongniang is busy and flustered. Hiding the qin in its bag. Extinguishing the incense in the censer. The incense table placed aside. Closing the green gauze window. Following the young lady back to her boudoir. Only to hear the cry, "The long summer day, the cool breeze stirs the water. The cool breeze stirs the water, fragrant lotuses." Indeed, the summer scene is extraordinary.

### The Majestic Light Presents "The Socialite's Record of Thievery"

Since the New Year, the Majestic Light Grand Theatre has been showing only the finest films, making it the most successful cinema in all of Shanghai. Starting today, they will present the romantic detective masterpiece "The Socialite's Record of Thievery" (IS Miaiden Lane). This film is the latest production from 20th Century Fox, starring克兰屈勒佛 and 西撒罗密洛. The story tells of a master diamond thief who, despite the strict security and numerous detectives in the jewelry store, is ultimately successful. Later, a socialite bravely sacrifices her reputation, infiltrating the gang. Although the thief is full of cunning schemes, he is no match for her, and all the secrets of the gang are exposed, leading to the thief's capture. The acting of both the male and female leads in this film is superb, and the plot unfolds with constant ups and downs, sure to move the audience deeply.

### The Three Stars of "Eternal Smile"

"Eternal Smile" is the Star Film Company's first major sound film starring Hu Die this year. Hu Die performs many songs in the film, starting with the theme song of "Beautiful Woman." Later, there are three excerpts from Peking opera: "The Red Thread Treasure Box" (sung during a pleasant outing on Zijin Mountain), "Yu Tang Chun," and "Hui Long Ge" (sung in a nightclub). Hu Die is well-versed in the art of Qingyi opera, so her singing is truly nuanced and extraordinary.

In "Eternal Smile," Shu Xiuwen plays a promiscuous woman who abandons her husband. The night before she elopes with her lover, she pretends that her mother has fallen seriously ill in the countryside, tearfully pleading with Hu Die to lend her one hundred dollars. Hu Die, always eager to help those in need, generously gives her all one hundred dollars. As she leaves Hu Die's room with the money, she lights up at the sight of the red and green banknotes, instantly turning her tears into a smile. Realizing that Hu Die might hear her laughter and uncover her secret, she pretends to sob again. However, the thought of escaping with her lover with the money makes her laugh out loud again. In this scene, Shu Xiuwen perfectly portrays the hypocrisy and ugliness of a certain type of woman.

Gong Qiuxia plays Hu Die's younger sister in "Eternal Smile," an immature singer. She is the adopted daughter of Wang Xianzhai and suffers greatly from his abuse, appearing extremely pitiful. During the scene where the piano teacher Xie Yunqing teaches her to sing "Yu Tang Chun," she is so afraid that she always pronounces the "san" (three) in Su San as "chang" (place), creating many humorous moments.

"Eternal Smile" will be shown at the Jin Cheng Grand Theatre starting tomorrow, with a public preview in the morning.

### Mother Wang Sells Her Blood

In these hard economic times, it is not easy for poor people to survive. As long as there is money, anything can be done!

Mother Wang, Sang Shuzhen, is a famous plump woman. She is as fat as a winter melon, making everyone who sees her laugh. Her plumpness comes from an abundance of blood, so when she is left with no choice, she sells her blood.

Selling blood is a tragic thing. Exposing one's arm to have blood drawn is not only tearful for the person selling the blood, but also heartbreaking for those who witness it!

The scene of Mother Wang selling her blood is depicted with great emotion in the Tianyi Film Company's new film "Mr. Wang's Way to Make a Fortune," which will soon bring tears of sympathy to moviegoers.
