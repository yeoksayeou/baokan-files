### Fierce Bloodshed as the Enemy Launches Several Counterattacks Near Wusong Town Yesterday and Today

Our Original Defensive Line Possesses Strong Military Strength, Launching a Large-Scale Encirclement and Attack on the Remaining Enemy

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After the enemy landed at Wusong and was met with a head-on blow by our army, the remaining enemy forces that had not been eliminated retreated and gathered in the area of Yunzaobang and Zhanghuabang, falling into a heavy encirclement by our army. Around 2:00 AM yesterday, a large number of enemy warships at the mouth of Wusong bombarded our coastal positions with heavy artillery. Under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft, a portion of the enemy troops secretly crossed the river in the Yunzaobang area of Wusong and landed, launching a counterattack against our frontline defending troops. From morning to noon, the two sides engaged in fierce combat. The remaining enemy forces trapped in Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang also attempted to break through to the north, with a portion entering Wusong Town. Our large army stationed at Paotaiwan then launched a full-scale head-on attack, confronting the enemy near Wusong Town. The two sides engaged in extremely fierce bloodshed. The fighting paused slightly around 11:00 PM last night, but the bloodshed resumed at 1:00 AM this morning. The sounds of artillery fire shook the sky, and the fighting involved intense charges and hand-to-hand combat. The intensity of the struggle was unprecedented. As of 3:00 AM this morning, the two sides were still locked in a stalemate. One group of the enemy forces trapped in Yunzaobang attempted to break through and attack Yinhang in an attempt to coordinate with the enemy in Yangshupu, but they were forced back to their original position by our army's heavy pressure. The remaining enemy forces in Zhanghuabang are currently building fortifications to defend against our attacks.

Our army is currently awaiting an opportunity to attack the Yunzaobang and Zhanghuabang areas, breaking through any one of the ports at the Shizilin and Liuhe area, with the intention of launching a large-scale attack. However, our large army stationed along the river is prepared for any eventuality.

Around 3:30 AM this morning, aircraft flew in from the west, vaguely visible in the eastern sky. They dropped four or five bombs, which exploded in rapid succession with loud bangs that could be heard far and wide. This reporter immediately drove out to investigate and was informed that the bombs had been dropped in the northeast.

### Our Army Repulses the Remaining Enemy in Luodian

The enemy forces are hastily building defensive fortifications in various locations north of Luodian. Due to a minor flood in recent days, warships cannot approach the shore. They have specially transported small speedboats from their home country, which are moored in the river, attempting to invade again.

Central News Agency reports that the enemy forces that landed in the Liuhe, Shidong, and Shizilin areas have launched fierce attacks on our army's positions since dawn yesterday, but all have been repelled by our army's head-on counterattacks. However, the enemy forces are still attempting to resist stubbornly. A temporary command headquarters was established near Luodian, which was discovered by our army. Our army then used intense artillery fire to accurately bombard it. It is reported that the command headquarters has now been destroyed by our army's artillery fire.

Central News Agency reports that the remaining enemy forces northwest of Luodian have suffered heavy casualties after being surrounded and attacked by us but are still trying to resist stubbornly. Our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy from three directions around midnight yesterday morning, using heavy artillery to bombard them. The enemy responded hastily and resisted for a long time, but ultimately they were unable to receive reinforcements and fled north in disarray. In this battle, many high-ranking enemy officers and over a hundred soldiers were killed. A certain regimental commander who was directing operations on the front line was also killed in action. The intensity of the battle is evident. However, the enemy is quite unwilling to accept defeat and will await reinforcements to launch a counterattack.

### Intense Gunfire and Artillery in Hongkou and Zhabei

After being dealt a heavy blow by our army, the enemy in the Hongkou area have been hiding in their defensive fortifications, not daring to cross the fortified positions. However, at 12:00 PM on the 30th, they suddenly stirred again and launched two counterattacks against us, but both were repelled by us. The enemy forces opposite Bazibridge also launched an attack on Bazibridge around 11:00 PM on the same day. For a time, the gunfire was intense, like a string of pearls. After we retaliated, the enemy gradually showed signs of being unable to withstand the pressure. By 1:00 AM yesterday morning, they had been completely repelled. In this battle, an estimated twenty enemy soldiers were killed. The enemy forces on North Sichuan Road also launched a fierce attack on our Zhabei area before dawn yesterday morning, concentrating artillery fire and troops in the North Station area. All were bravely repelled by our army. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. Currently, in addition to strengthening our existing positions, we are also seeking opportunities to gradually advance forward.

### Enemy Aircraft Rampage Everywhere

Massacring Defenseless Refugees, Bombing Non-Military Housing

Zhabei

Yesterday at 6:00 PM, four enemy aircraft were active in Zhabei, dropping seven or eight bombs. Central News Agency reports that around 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, enemy aircraft dropped bombs in the Zhabei area. Three bombs hit the McCay Road train station, but only a small section of the track was damaged, and the losses were minimal. Houses in the Datong Road and Xinmin Road area were hit by sulfur bombs, which exploded immediately, causing fires that were not extinguished by nightfall. However, no one was injured. One bomb also hit a water tank at the Hengfeng Road Water and Electricity Plant but did not detonate.

Nanshi

Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, enemy aircraft appeared over Nanshi again. There were a total of eighteen aircraft, flying in from the northeast and heading west along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, their purpose unclear. They passed through Nanshi without dropping bombs.

Pudong

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, three enemy aircraft circled over the Pudong area, dropping several bombs near Xinma Road, behind the Osaka warehouse in Yangjiadu, which landed in the fields.

Baoshan

Central News Agency reports that enemy aircraft continued to drop bombs indiscriminately yesterday. In the morning, several aircraft bombed Baoshan County and the towns of Yuepu and others within the county, destroying civilian houses.

Yanghang

Central News Agency reports that around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, approximately 200 refugees and wounded soldiers who had been evacuated from the war zone were resting at the long-distance bus station in Yanghang Town. At that time, a squadron of enemy aircraft suddenly arrived and circled in the air several times before dropping over a dozen bombs. These 200 or so displaced refugees and wounded soldiers, who had no way to escape, were all killed. The enemy aircraft's repeated bombing of refugees and wounded soldiers can be described as the height of inhumanity.

Dachang

Central News Agency reports that yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, four members of a burial team dispatched by the Red Cross to the Dachang area were working when enemy aircraft suddenly fired machine guns at the team, injuring two of them. The injured have now been sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

Jiading

Since the outbreak of fighting in Zhabei, Nanxiang Town was the first to be bombed, with over fifty bombs hitting the entire town, destroying dozens of civilian houses. Starting on the 22nd, four or five bombs were dropped on the west gate of the city, Qiubridge West, and the warehouse bridge outside the north gate, killing one farmer. One bomb hit the northern countryside of Loutang Town, killing six farmers. Within the city, the county government office, the prison, the police station, the Qinghe Bridge inside the north gate, the Gujia Ancestral Hall, the Yang family's civilian houses, the Qingjie Hall, the Lu Chang South Goods Store inside the east gate, the Shen Xiaodi Barber Shop, the Gong Shun Chang Workshop behind Yangshu Creek, the Da Long Rice Store inside the west gate, the Lu family's residence, the Li Religion Association, the Chengde School, the Yarn Factory Lane outside the south gate, the Yongyuan Salted Meat Shop outside the west gate, next to Hou Huang Bridge, Qiubridge West, and other places were bombed countless times. Within the city, the Wannianchun Pharmacy and over a dozen civilian houses on Guanjia Bridge, as well as dozens of sheds belonging to Hui Ji Hou Jiangbei outside the west gate, were hit by bombs and burned down.

### Deceptive Tactics of the Japanese Government

This newspaper's reporter recently interviewed a prominent merchant who had just returned from Japan. He spoke of the recent general situation in Japan. His report is recorded below:

(The following are all the merchant's words) Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Japan has fully implemented wartime organization. When the battle began in Tianjin and Beijing, the national war mania became even more urgent. Initially, they did not expect to encounter such an unprecedented blow in Shanghai. Commander Hasegawa of the Third Fleet repeatedly telegraphed the Tokyo military headquarters for assistance. At that time, the Japanese military sent a large number of naval, land, and air forces to Shanghai for reinforcements while strictly controlling public opinion to prevent news of the defeat from leaking out. Therefore, immediately all national newspapers, in addition to completely adopting the Domei News Agency's reports, were prohibited from disclosing anything else. At the same time, they fabricated various reports of victories, even claiming that the Japanese army had advanced to Suzhou and Changzhou. Their deceptive tactics reached their extreme. However, although the Japanese warlords' precautions were thorough, true information about the Japanese army being trapped in bitter fighting was constantly transmitted to the ears of steady elders and general financial groups. The most worried were the Japanese elders, especially Prince Saionji. Saionji planned to immediately send special personnel to Shanghai, ostensibly to comfort the troops, but in reality to investigate the actual battle situation. When Prime Minister Konoe heard this, he was panicked and rushed to Gotemba on the 25th to visit Saionji, requesting his understanding. From the Domei News Agency's statement in Gotemba on the 26th, "Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement" which said, "...reluctantly gradually expanding the front lines, Prince Saionji is quite concerned about this matter. His concerns are the same as anyone else's, but things have reached this point, and there is no good solution. I have fully explained this point and obtained his understanding..." it can be seen that Konoe's evasiveness and panic. In the same statement, Konoe also said, "...the financial problem is to submit a supplementary budget to the provisional parliament. It is a long story, so it was not discussed. It is not yet known whether the supplementary budget will exceed 2 billion yuan, but it seems to reach a considerable amount..." These few words fully demonstrate that the Japanese government's financial problems are already on the verge of being stretched to the limit and running out of resources.

### The Propaganda Committee of the Support Association Informs All Citizens of Four Matters

The Propaganda Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association yesterday issued a notice to all citizens regarding four matters, which are recorded below:

The Issue of Donating Money and Goods

Since the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai, the patriotic enthusiasm of our citizens can be said to have reached its peak. In terms of donating money and goods, everyone is eager to contribute, fearing to be left behind. This is a good phenomenon, but problems have also arisen here. Donations of money are handled by banks designated by the Fundraising Committee, and donations of goods are collected by the Supply Committee based on the needs of the front lines, with announcements published in newspapers at any time. The methods are very appropriate, but all kinds of street fundraisers have been found in the city, some carrying cloth bags and holding small booklets, causing chaos in the markets and lanes. We certainly cannot say that all these fundraisers are using false pretenses, but they do not report the donations they receive, and there is no way to audit or supervise them. Their purpose is unknown. Even if all the donations received can be used for public purposes, such unplanned, unsystematic, and disorganized situations not only waste public resources but also do not contribute to the actual situation. Therefore, we hope that all sectors can firmly refuse these unreliable street fundraisers and send donations directly to the banks designated by this association, obtaining receipts to exchange for public bonds, or directly purchase national salvation bonds for national use, which is the most appropriate. Because this anti-Japanese war is a comprehensive and protracted war, the scope of the war is definitely not limited to Shanghai alone. Only the government, which has an overall view of the situation, knows best how to allocate and use national salvation donations and can handle them most appropriately. As for the items currently most needed on the front lines, they are not food but rather items related to the anti-Japanese war, such as burlap sacks (or cloth bags that can hold sand), steel plates, iron wire, bicycles, and electrical wires and telephones. The Supply Committee of this Support Association not only has the task of supplying goods but also has a clear understanding of the needs of the front lines. Donations must be made according to the types indicated in the newspapers in order to achieve the greatest effectiveness. Do not blindly listen to others and donate whatever you want. You must know that wasting one penny is consuming one point of national strength.

The Issue of Youth Battlefield Service

The sound of artillery fire in the Songhu anti-Japanese war has ignited the long-dormant enthusiasm of the city's masses. Therefore, "going to the front lines" has become the earnest hope of the general youth. This is certainly a revelation of the dawn of the Chinese nation, but the victory of the anti-Japanese war cannot be grasped by pure emotional action. It must be understood that the national liberation struggle is a difficult and great task. Only by combining the tasks of rear support and front-line combat can there be effective results. Moreover, youth is the main artery of the nation. If all the youth go to the front lines to sacrifice themselves, not only will no one bear the responsibility for rear support work, but the national strength will also be weakened from now on. We believe that the responsibilities that youth should bear are many, such as organizing mass village propaganda, refugee education, reporting traitors, and maintaining order, all of which are extremely important. If these tasks are done well, they will be of great help to the soldiers on the front lines, which is much better than a crowd with no battlefield experience running to the front lines to fight. Even if the front lines need reinforcements, there are still militia and strong men available for deployment. Youth can do greater tasks than soldiers, and the nation's expectations for youth are very great. Therefore, we should replace the mistake of "going to the front lines" with "going to the rear to work." Fortunately, the government has issued a clear order to conscript national soldiers. When necessary, we are not afraid of not having the opportunity to "go to the front lines."

The Issue of Women and Children

The entire Shanghai has fallen into the firing line, and even the concessions are not safe areas. The bombs in front of the Great World and Sincere Company have fully proven this to us. Since Zhabei and Hongkou were occupied as war zones, the general public has rushed to move into the concessions. Nanshi, which has been repeatedly ravaged by enemy aircraft, has also seen a continuous stream of people arriving. The population of the concessions has therefore increased several times. If the war is prolonged or even unexpected changes occur, not only will food become a problem, but there will also be the danger of being bombed and sacrificed at any time. We feel that those who have the means should send their women and children to the inland. Women in families who have no means should also fulfill their wartime service responsibilities. Recently, the Technical Committee of the Support Association has been sewing gas masks, and many women are doing this work, which is a good example.

The Issue of Wartime Education

This anti-Japanese war is a war for the survival of the nation. We must not give in halfway without achieving final victory. Surrender means destruction. Therefore, in the long-term anti-Japanese war, in addition to engaging in battlefield service work, all basic undertakings, especially education, should be actively suspended. All universities and specialized schools should ideally relocate to relatively safe areas. Other primary and secondary schools should also try to open as much as possible so that the general youth and children will not waste their time due to the war. However, there are several prerequisites here. First, wartime education should differ from peacetime education. Second, in addition to ordinary courses, wartime knowledge (such as air raid defense, gas defense, and first aid) should be added. Third, teachers and staff should guide students to engage in a portion of wartime service work during their free time. Only in this way can the long-term anti-Japanese war be sustainable and practical.

### A Person from the Front Lines Talks About the Intelligence and Courage of Our Army

Annihilating the Enemy in Yunzaobang with Fewer Troops, Defending the Songhu Road, Advancing and Retreating Strategically

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that a certain typesetting worker of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury recently joined the battlefield engineering corps and has just returned from the front lines of Wusong. When he entered the office, his former colleagues cheered and comforted him. He replied, "Don't worry, don't worry, our army is calmly responding to the battle, and the enemy has no opportunity to take advantage of." He also recounted the scene of the bloody battle on the front lines, saying that on Friday night, 300 Chinese soldiers defeated 500 to 800 Japanese soldiers in Yunzaobang. If the enemy soldiers had not used aircraft to assist in the battle, the Chinese soldiers would not have lost a single person. The enemy soldiers, angered that their detachment was annihilated by the Chinese soldiers, dropped ten bombs from an aircraft in an attempt to save face, but only one of the bombs hit the Chinese soldiers, causing more than a hundred casualties. He is now installing telephones for the Chinese soldiers on the front lines and doing other miscellaneous tasks. He volunteered and risked danger without taking any compensation, saying, "Why should I worry? We must resist and save the country." He also said that on Friday night, the Chinese soldiers' front line was about one and one-third of a mile from the enemy soldiers' positions, separated by the Songhu Railway. Around 8:30 PM, the Chinese soldiers' outpost reported that the enemy soldiers were attacking. The Chinese soldiers' commander then ordered a rapid retreat. The 300 Chinese soldiers retreated about a mile and lay in ambush in sheltered trenches, waiting for the enemy to arrive. About 120 enemy soldiers advanced and stopped to wait for reinforcements when they were about 800 yards from the Chinese soldiers' positions. Soon, the reinforcements arrived, totaling about 500 to 800 soldiers. When the enemy soldiers advanced to a certain point, the Chinese soldiers detonated landmines, causing great chaos among the enemy soldiers. The Chinese soldiers then took advantage of the situation and opened fire, fiercely bombarding the enemy. In less than an hour, all the enemy soldiers were annihilated. The Chinese soldiers fought with Lee-Enfield rifles, machine guns, and Mauser rifles, and they were very calm. They were all veterans of many battles. About half an hour later, another team of enemy soldiers arrived, numbering about 100. The two sides bombarded each other for about two hours, and the enemy was unable to withstand the pressure and retreated, abandoning many dead and wounded. The Chinese soldiers then returned to their original positions on the west side of the railway. When he was recounting this, he was very proud. When asked why he joined the army, he replied, "I am a Chinese person and must do my duty for the country. My family tried to stop me, so I lied and said that I would not go to the front lines but only transport goods for the soldiers in the rear. My family has now returned to the countryside, and now everything is free. I originally wanted to join the regular army, but because I am familiar with installing telephones and other work, I was assigned to do this on the front lines. I used to be a telephone student at the Shanghai Telephone Company."

### The Two Chambers of Commerce and Industry Actively Promote Fundraising for National Salvation Bonds

### Female Aviator Yang Jin-xun Volunteers to Kill the Enemy

Visiting the Aviation Department in Beijing to Request Permission

The Shenzhou News Agency reports that Ms. Yang Jin-xun of Changsha graduated with honors from the Chinese Flying Society in this city. She is proficient in piloting and is an outstanding talent in China's aviation industry. During the fall of Tianjin and Beijing, Ms. Yang once volunteered to kill the enemy and was approved by our central aviation authorities. This time, the Japanese invaders provoked our Songhu, and our air force has repeatedly swept and severely attacked them, causing the enemy to be terrified. Ms. Yang, with the intention of killing the enemy one day, reportedly went to Beijing again with several classmates a few days ago to visit the aviation authorities and ask for instructions, determined to serve the country and fulfill her long-cherished wish.

### The Great Coalition of Korean Parties Seeks to Restore Their Homeland

The Huadong News Agency reports that the patriots of Korea, since the loss of their country, have fled overseas and lived in our country, the United States, and other places, constantly seeking the restoration of their homeland for over twenty years. Since the September 18th Incident, the party has been actively engaged in activities. According to those who know the details, the reason why the Korean party's cause has not progressed smoothly is that there are many internal factions, which is an important reason. According to a reliable source recently, the Korean party has deeply realized the mistakes of the past since the January 28th Incident. Initiated by the Korean Nationalist Party, it will unite the Korean People's National Association, the Union Association, the Comrades Association, the Korean Patriotic Association, the Korean Nationalist Party, the Korean Independence Party, and other nine major groups in order to concentrate the scattered forces and restore their homeland. It is reported that the Korean Nationalist Party is the only major party led by Kim Gu, the leader of the Korean revolution, and Kim was the mastermind of the Hongkou Park incident.

### The Chamber of Commerce Requests to Extend the Curfew Time

Writing to the Authorities of the Two Concessions to Change the Starting Time to 12:00 PM

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Concession Council, stating, "Greetings, The order within the boundaries is now gradually stabilizing. Various businesses, after being persuaded and guided by this chamber, have also resumed operations one after another. The curfew time set by your bureau, starting at 10:00 PM, is quite inconvenient. We propose that the starting time be extended to 12:00 PM in the evening to facilitate traffic. We eagerly await your response."

### The Anti-Japanese Association Formulates Measures to Unify National Salvation Organizations

They sent the measures to the presidium of the Support Association for decision and implementation. The measures have now been drafted and were approved by the presidium yesterday and will be announced and implemented immediately. The measures are recorded below: ① All anti-Japanese and national salvation organizations in the city shall take the "Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association" as the highest organization. ② Under the highest organization, all circles may organize national salvation associations or "wartime service corps" separately in accordance with legal procedures. However, all groups should make full use of existing organizations or add special committees to their organizations to concentrate anti-Japanese and national salvation work, without the need to organize separately. ③ In order to concentrate anti-Japanese forces and communicate opinions from all parties, the national salvation associations organized by all circles and the special committees attached to the various groups should all register with the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association. ④ The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association should convene a discussion meeting of the heads of the various groups that have been registered at least every two weeks to report on the work situation and exchange opinions on anti-Japanese support. ⑤ If the various groups that have been registered need to raise donations, they should submit the methods and donation books to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for approval and affix the seal of the Social Affairs Bureau before they can solicit donations. ⑥ The various groups that have been registered should have the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association consult with the Accountants Association to select members to serve as accountants for the various groups. ⑦ Those who do not complete the registration procedures with the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association or refuse to send personnel to manage the accounting affairs shall be dealt with appropriately by the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association based on their circumstances.

Current Commentary

### Less Appeal, More Suggestions

— Zhang Naiqi

It has been a month since I was released from prison. Many friends asked me why I have not published any political views, but only published a few articles on the design of mass organizations and current affairs analysis. My answer is.

First. When the national policy has not yet been determined. We must make more political appeals to enable the national policy to be determined sooner. Now that the national policy has been determined. We should make fewer political appeals. Make more active suggestions so that the national policy can be enriched sooner. When the country reaches the time of life and death. Since the government already has a clear national policy. Anyone with a conscience. Who would want to be unconventional to gain fame? Everyone should concentrate their efforts on cultivating strength. How can we still have factional views of each other? Consume every bit of national strength in open and secret struggles.

Second. The people must demand to know the outline of the national policy and the general direction of the major policies. The people should not demand to know the detailed content of the national policy. And the specific steps of the major policies. It's like taking a boat. The destination must be asked clearly. It is also possible to ask for a general idea of the route. But how exactly to pass through this route. Arrive at the destination. We can only trust the helmsman. We oppose the autocratic concept of "the people can be made to follow, but not to know". However, it is absolutely impossible to advocate that passengers can interfere with the duties of the helmsman. Even under the typical democratic system, the parliament. Only a few representatives participate. And representatives cannot interfere with the government's actions everywhere. During extraordinary periods, the parliament often has to give the government greater powers. So that it can make emergency arrangements. In semi-colonial China. Especially when this full-scale war of resistance has already broken out. We plan for the interests of the nation. We must trust the government more. So that it can exercise greater power. At the same time, keep more secrets. Therefore. We demand democracy. But we can never dream of a typical democracy right away. The times and the environment must be taken into account.

Based on the above two points. I will make some more specific explanations.

For example. The central government is stepping up the policy of mass organization. We already know. Regarding the party members' instruction to "eliminate all previous internal and external prejudices". We have also seen it. Then. Regarding the mass organization. We don't need to and shouldn't make political appeals for the principle of "opening up mass organizations". But only under this principle. From a practical point of view. Suggest more plans on how to strengthen mass organizations and how to thoroughly overcome prejudice. Therefore. I can only publish some unremarkable suggestions on neighborhood organizations and professional organizations. Negatively, so that the rear order can be stabilized. Positively, so that the people's assistance to the front can be organized and mobilized. At the same time. Many young people are depressed under the cry of "no work to do". It can also get a broad avenue for work.

For example again. In the military field. The situation of the full-scale war of resistance has already unfolded. The determination to resist to the end has also been clearly expressed by the supreme military leader. After that, we only need to be under the principle of full-scale war of resistance and resistance to the end. Make more suggestions on how to mobilize national resources and manpower and how to strengthen national defense construction. As for the attack and defense, advance and retreat of a temporary place. That is a question of military strategy. It is the authority of the military authorities. It is the country's highest secret. The people have no reason to interfere.

For example again. In the financial field. The wartime financial policy is already being implemented. We don't need to appeal with the slogan of "implementing the wartime financial policy". And there is no need to come up with a sensational wartime financial policy to disturb people's hearts. Now the inland discount method. It has already been promulgated. The 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds. It has also been decided to issue. This indicates that the current financial national policy is by no means limited to passive emergency response. But it actively contains the significance of strengthening national defense construction. Passive emergency response is just an indispensable measure in the transitional period. Naturally. This initiative is still very insufficient. That may be limited by national strength. It cannot be achieved overnight. At this time. We can only be under the current principle. On how to use financial power to promote production. Consolidate national defense. On the issue of mobilizing the whole country. Make more design suggestions. To increase the initiative of the current financial national policy and enrich its content. We should not hesitate at all to suggest. But we should be particularly cautious about those who have different opinions in principle. If we think that the past measures of the financial authorities are still appropriate. Then. Now, besides trusting them more, what better way is there?

The people should make more suggestions to the government under the principle of national policy to fully consider the people's suggestions. This is the only way for the top and bottom to work together to face the outside world. I repeat. We need to make fewer appeals and more suggestions right now. The method of competitive elections in constitutional countries during peacetime. It is absolutely impossible to use it right now.

[Guangzhou] Enemy planes attacked Guangzhou twice on the morning of the 31st. The first time was at 5:45 AM when six enemy planes were spotted flying from the west. In addition to issuing an alert, the city's air defense department dispatched all members of the civil defense corps to assist the police in guiding citizens to take shelter.

### Japanese Side Makes Specious Arguments to Cover Up the Bombing of the South Railway Station

Clear Investigation of the Number of Dead and Injured; How Can the Facts Be Denied?

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the North Railway Station has been in the line of fire, so the South Railway Station is the only exit for land transportation of refugees. In recent days, thousands of people have been rescued and sent away by various Chinese and foreign charitable organizations. On the afternoon of August 28, those waiting for trains at the station were quite crowded, but enemy planes dropped bombs there. At that time, more than 200 people were killed and more than 500 were injured. The reporter recently investigated from various sources. Excluding those whose bodies were intact and claimed by relatives for burial, the Pushan Villa collected 74 males and 2 females, and the Tongren Fuyuantang collected 39 males and 5 females, in addition to countless remains. The reporter also went to various hospitals to investigate the injured, and the person in charge of the hospital issued a certificate. Renji Hospital has about 100 people, including two women, two men, one boy, one girl, and one infant, who died of serious injuries. Twenty-two people were seriously injured and hospitalized, and 40 were sent to other hospitals for treatment. The remaining slightly injured were discharged after bandaging. Baolong Hospital had 28 people, one male and two females, who died upon arrival. Another four males and two females died one or two days after arrival. Another twelve people (including four children) had very minor injuries and were discharged immediately. The remaining seven are still hospitalized. Zongshan Hospital had Zuo Qingsheng, a resident near the station, who died of serious injuries on the 30th. The Red Swastika Society had 12 people, two of whom were slightly injured and discharged immediately, and the rest were sent to the Third Hospital, including five males, one female, and two children, who have died. The Red Cross had 13 people, including three males and one female who died immediately, three were hospitalized, and the rest were bandaged and discharged. There are still many people admitted to other hospitals and relief hospitals, totaling more than 500 people. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Allied Press released news saying that those who were bombed, except for twelve peddlers, were all soldiers, totaling 120 people, half dead and half injured. This kind of propaganda that reverses black and white and confuses right and wrong is nothing more than an attempt to cover up their atrocities. How can they know that the South Railway Station is not far from the concession, and people from various countries can witness it. And the injured refugees in various hospitals have also been visited by people from various countries. The evidence is conclusive. From this, it can be seen that Japanese planes fly all over our country, harming innocent civilians. The Japanese side makes specious arguments to cover up everything, which is absurd. I am truly afraid of confusing Chinese and foreign public opinion, so I have recorded it in detail.

The English-language "Great Beauty Evening News" reported that the Japanese naval attaché stationed in Shanghai denied last night that Japanese aircraft attacked the South Railway Station, killing hundreds of civilians. He said that after detailed investigation, it was confirmed that the people killed, except for twelve people, were all soldiers. These twelve people were vendors selling food and gathering at the military station. Sixty Chinese soldiers were killed in the bombing, and another sixty Chinese soldiers died shortly after being seriously injured. There were also two hundred lightly injured Chinese soldiers. Several foreign reporters from the "Great Beauty Evening News" inspected the scene half an hour after the bombing and reiterated today that although the Japanese naval attaché denied killing civilians, the dead and injured lying all over the ground at that time were indeed male and female civilians, many of whom were children. These people were clearly refugees carrying packages and other items. Dozens of other foreign news reporters also unanimously made this statement. Therefore, the Japanese authorities have nothing to deny.

### Brutal Japanese Expel Residents of the Eastern District

Fortunately Rescued and Out of Danger

Since the Japanese relied on the eastern district of the concession as a base to challenge us, resulting in the Second Battle of Shanghai, the retreat of the enemy forces has forced residents of various countries in the eastern district to abandon their homes and properties and flee elsewhere, which is very pitiful. In recent days, the situation in the district seems to have eased, but many of our poor people still live in the district. However, the enemy suddenly ordered them to evacuate immediately yesterday. Fortunately, the concession authorities, together with the World Red Swastika Society, the Southeast General Association of China, and the International Relief Association, used trucks to transport them safely out of danger at 1:00 PM, and they were taken in by various charitable organizations. It is heard that the enemy's move was because a large number of reinforcements were coming to station there and occupy the civilian houses. Therefore, the residents were driven out and the houses were converted into barracks. In view of the brutal Japanese burning houses in Tianjin and Shanghai, it may be repeated there. (Central News Agency)

Central News Agency reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the police personnel went to Yangshupu, Hongkou, and other concession areas in dozens of trucks yesterday afternoon to investigate and persuade the remaining civilians to escape from the war zone. It is estimated that more than 5,000 people were escorted out of danger and arrived at the Waibaidu Bridge, and they were handed over to the Red Swastika Society to be distributed to various charitable organizations. It is estimated that the Red Swastika Society had more than 1,000 people, the Shanghai Charity Organization Federation had about 2,000 people, the International Disaster Relief Association had 1,000 people, and the Yisheng Rubber Factory had hundreds of people. They will be sent back to their hometowns separately. The enthusiastic relief from the various organizations has moved the homeless refugees to no end.

### Defense of the Concession Completed, Bund Lifted Martial Law

After the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession completed the deployment of all defensive works, the Bund area was announced to be lifted from martial law starting at 8:00 AM this morning. Traffic from Waibaidu Bridge to the Bund and various roads has been completely restored, and all vehicles and pedestrians are allowed to enter and exit freely. At present, the atmosphere on the Bund is unusually peaceful, as if it has returned to a non-wartime state. Most of the British troops and the International Settlement Volunteer Corps originally stationed at various key intersections in the Public Concession have been withdrawn, and armored vehicles are patrolling back and forth. There are hundreds of refugees waiting for ships to return to their hometowns at the wharves near the Jianghai Customs.

### Statistics on the Number of Refugees in the Public Concession

As of the day before yesterday (the 30th), there were a total of 105 refugee shelters in the Public Concession that had been surveyed by the Health Department of the Municipal Council, accommodating 52,106 refugees. 2,126 refugees in the Western District have been vaccinated. Refugees in all districts have not been injected with preventive vaccines.

Although the Chinese government's note does not request that the Sino-Japanese dispute be included in the agenda of the next regular session of the League of Nations General Assembly (meeting on September 13), China, as a semi-permanent member of the Executive Yuan, may file a complaint during the meeting of the Executive Yuan or the League of Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 17 of the Covenant. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas)

Content of the Note

It first stated that the Chinese government has always maintained a conciliatory attitude. In addition to fulfilling various agreements, it has repeatedly proposed to Japan to cease hostilities. However, due to Japan's deliberate aggression and vigorous expansion, it has been fruitless. The conclusion is divided into four sections, mainly as follows:

① Japanese troops invaded Chinese territory and used naval, land, and air forces to attack Chinese cities in northern and central China. This is purely an act of aggression, which is undoubtedly the case.

② Although China has exhausted all means to prevent violent aggression, it has failed. It has no choice but to implement resistance, which is China's exercise of its inherent right to self-defense.

③ Japan's aggression against China was based on a predetermined plan, which began with the September 18 Incident in 1931 and is still being implemented today. Although Japan has repeatedly stated that it has no territorial ambitions for China, it has occupied the Tianjin area and decided to occupy the entire North China in order to control other parts of China. Japan has made every effort to destroy China's construction projects, which have been painstakingly managed for the past ten years. This can be seen.

④ Japan has violated all kinds of existing international treaties one by one. For example, the country's deliberate destruction of peace in the Far East violates the basic principles contained in the Covenant of the League of Nations. The country uses war to pursue national policies and disdains using peaceful means to resolve international disputes. This violates the 1927 Kellogg-Briand Pact. The country does not respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. This violates the 1922 Nine-Power Treaty.

The Chinese government finally requested that the above-mentioned facts be notified to the member states of the League of Nations and the member states of the Advisory Committee (including the United States) established on February 24, 1934, due to the Incident in the Three Northeastern Provinces of China.

Attitude of Britain and France

[London] Regarding the war between China and Japan, British and French authorities have consulted with each other to determine the attitude to be taken after Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi expressed that his country may file a complaint to the League of Nations. British political figures believe that even if China files a complaint to the League of Nations, the actions of the League of Nations will be limited to issuing empty statements condemning Japan's attitude. According to informed British sources, the British and French governments have now decided that the British, French, and American authorities in Shanghai will continue to cooperate to advise China and Japan not to fight in Shanghai.

### British Ambassador to the United States Returns Home to Report on His Duties

Related to Far Eastern Issues; Welles Passes Through France to Italy

[London] British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, arrived here tonight. He told reporters that this trip has no political mission and is only to fulfill a plan scheduled for several months. However, diplomatic circles insist on this view, that is, the return of the British ambassador is bound to have a considerable relationship with Britain's efforts to form a joint British-American front in the Far East. (Haitong Telegram, 30th)

[Paris] US Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here today from the United States and transferred to the port of Venice, Italy, for rest that evening, and returned to France within three weeks. American personnel here believe that Welles' visit to Europe is a private trip. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas)

### The Establishment of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact Contributes to World Peace

Fighting for Freedom and Independence Together; A New Tool for Maintaining Collective Security

[Moscow] It is believed here that after the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the Soviet Russia's position in confronting Japan has been greatly enhanced. (National Telegram, 30th)

[Moscow] The newspapers have recently commented on the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, all pointing out that the Soviet Union is unswervingly committed to the principle of the indivisibility of peace and has a close friendship with China. The Soviet government's official newspaper, "News," stated, "The Far Eastern incident is sufficient to threaten general peace, which the Soviet Union pays special attention to. The fact that the Soviet Union now has good relations with China can also be seen in the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact." The Communist Party's official newspaper, "Truth," stated, "The Chinese nation is now fighting for freedom and independence. The Soviet nation hereby expresses its friendship to the Chinese nation. The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is its clear proof. Peace is indivisible and needs to be defended in both the West and the Far East. All of this has been proven by the Non-Aggression Pact. The Soviet Union is deeply concerned about peace in the Far East and therefore pays special attention to the alarming incidents currently occurring in China that are sufficient to threaten general peace. Today, the danger of war is increasing everywhere, not only in Europe but also in the Far East. The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is a clear proof of the implementation of the principle of collective security along the Pacific coast and a new tool for maintaining general peace and collective security. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas)

### Varying Opinions in Europe and the United States

Britain Believes It Is Absolutely Harmless

[London] Regarding the establishment of the Sino-Russian Non-Aggression Pact, British officials have made very few comments, only saying that the treaty is "absolutely harmless." It is difficult to believe the Japanese rumors that there are secret clauses attached to the text of the treaty. (Central News Agency, 30th)

[London] According to the "Morning News" diplomatic weekly, both the British ambassador to Russia and the chargé d'affaires to China have received formal notifications from their respective countries. The correspondent believes that the Sino-Russian agreement has no direct relationship with Britain, and at the same time does not violate the obligations of China and Russia as members of the League of Nations. (Haitong Telegram, 31st)

### The United States Fears Germany Will Find an Excuse

[Washington] American semi-official figures have recently commented on the conclusion of the Sino-Russian Non-Aggression Pact, believing that German leader Hitler may use the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact as an excuse to implement so-called necessary defense measures. If so, the situation in the Far East will inevitably become more and more complicated. According to the latest news from Tokyo, the United States' attempt to mediate the Shanghai war has failed, and Japan's attitude towards China remains unchanged. People generally believe that the US government will make another effort this week to mediate in a more direct way. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas)

### German Personnel Have Unique Insights

[Berlin] German newspapers commented on the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, believing that it is very important to China's future, believing that the Soviet Union will never abide by it within the scope of this treaty. One newspaper said that the situation in the Far East may become more serious because of this treaty, because Japan will see it as a military treaty rather than a defensive treaty. The path to a final understanding in the Sino-Japanese conflict now seems to be blocked. Judging from the phenomena, the Far East will be the focus of world attention for a long time. (Central News Agency, 31st, Reuters)

### Italy Remains Silent

[Rome] Italian newspapers, besides carrying the news of the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, have not commented further, and responsible parties are maintaining strict silence. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 30th)

### Ships of Various Countries Repeatedly Threatened, France Proposes Mediterranean Pact

Relevant Countries to Meet and Discuss; Britain Decides After Thorough Study

[London] Due to repeated attacks on ships of various countries in the Mediterranean Sea by submarines or aircraft, the French government has proposed convening a meeting of Britain, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, and other countries in Geneva during the League of Nations conference to discuss joint solutions. This proposal is currently being considered by the British government. In addition, France has also proposed that the countries concerned jointly protest to Italy against interfering with ships of various countries in the Mediterranean Sea, and intends to formulate a plan advocating the conclusion of a Mediterranean Pact to ensure safety. This proposal and plan are also being thoroughly studied by the British government. It is reported that the French side has stated that the various efforts of Britain and France are solely to prevent incidents from occurring again in the Mediterranean Sea. If these efforts fail to achieve results and Italy continues to openly interfere with the ships of various countries navigating the Mediterranean Sea, France intends to consider restoring its freedom of action regarding the matter of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 31st)

[Paris] After the Spanish Nationalist Army occupied the northern port of Santander on the 23rd of this month, Commander-in-Chief General Franco sent a telegram to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini expressing his gratitude for the Italian troops' participation in the battle. The Italian Prime Minister immediately replied, stating that the Italian troops were honored to fight on Spanish soil. As a result, the intervention of Italy and Germany in the Spanish Civil War has been publicly acknowledged by the Italian Prime Minister. Regarding this matter, the British and French governments are currently consulting to adopt a common stance. Political figures say that if Italy does not change its attitude, the French government should reconsider the entire non-intervention policy. Although France is currently striving to maintain coordination with Britain, it may take necessary special measures in the near future. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 30th)

### Germany Bans Arms Shipments to Spain

[Berlin] Today's German government gazette published an order prohibiting German ships from carrying military supplies to Spanish ports. The prohibited items include rifles, bullets, armored vehicles, bombs, poison gas, artillery shells, explosives, aircraft, etc. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 30th)

### Misbombing of the "President Hoover" Incident; US Understands Considerably

Besides Demanding Compensation for Losses, No Other Action Planned

[Washington] US Secretary of State Hull today instructed US Ambassador to China Johnson to protest the bombing of the US ship "President Hoover" and to pay attention to all aspects of the matter. According to Hull, the US Navy is convinced that there are many ships near Shanghai, sufficient to transport the 2,000 American expatriates still residing in Shanghai out of the city if necessary. Therefore, the government may advise American merchant ships not to sail to Shanghai before the war ends. Judging from Hull's tone, the US government does not intend to take any action other than protest regarding the "President Hoover" incident. As for the losses suffered by the ship, a bill may be drawn up and China will be asked to pay compensation. Official circles do not believe that the ship was bombed deliberately, as there was prior information that Japanese warships were indeed nearby. (National News Agency, 30th)

[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting today expressed his sympathy to those injured in the bombing of the "President Hoover" in a personal capacity. (National News Agency, 30th)

[New York] After the US mail ship "President Hoover" was mistakenly bombed by Chinese aircraft, the New York Times commented that American public opinion would definitely increase pressure on the government to immediately implement the Neutrality Act. However, since the Chinese government has stated that it is willing to bear full responsibility and expressed its apology, its position towards the United States will not change due to this unfortunate incident, nor will it promote the implementation of the Neutrality Act. So far, the US government has not implemented the Neutrality Act for two reasons: (1) Implementing the Neutrality Act means acknowledging that a state of war already exists between China and Japan, and the hope of resolving the current dispute peacefully will be hindered as a result. (2) The implementation of the Neutrality Act may anger China or Japan, or even cause both countries to feel uncomfortable, and the position of American expatriates in China will become even more difficult. Moreover, the Chinese side's error is much less serious than the bombing of non-combatant Chinese civilians by Japanese aircraft and the attack on the British ambassador far from the front lines. In short, if Japan continues to go its own way in China, it will alienate itself from Britain and bring China and the Soviet Union closer together. Japan must be aware of this. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 31st)

### British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's Condition Improving

Flag from Car Roof Found; 30 Inches Long, 12 Inches Wide

British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's injury is of great concern to all parties. He has been in the hospital for six days and is making good progress, which is gratifying to the general public.

[London] It is now learned that the British flag that was on the roof of the car when British Ambassador to China Knatchbull-Hugessen was attacked by Japanese aircraft has been found. The British authorities in Shanghai measured the flag to be 30 inches long and 12 inches wide. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 30th)

[London] It was learned here today that Britain's protest to Tokyo regarding the injury of Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen in China will demand an early reply from Japan to avoid delays. (National News Agency, 30th)

### US Sailors Sailing to the Far East Demand Hazard Pay

[New York] After the Da Lai Company's "President Hoover" was mistakenly bombed by aircraft outside Wusongkou, China, the Seafarers International Union recently demanded that shipowners pay each sailor sailing to the war zones of China and Japan hazard pay of $250 per month. The union president has also asked shipowners to convene a joint labor-management meeting immediately to discuss the matter. If shipowners refuse this request, the Seafarers International Union will take action as appropriate. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 30th)

### More Than 500 Foreigners Leave Shanghai by Ship for Europe

Today (31st) at 10 a.m., another 500-plus foreigners took a small boat from the New Customs Wharf to Songkou, where they boarded the Java Shipping Company's Tjisaroea, which had arrived in Shanghai yesterday and was docked there, to go to Hong Kong and then transfer to Europe. Most of the foreigners leaving Shanghai this time were Dutch nationals. In addition, the first group of students studying in the United States this year, who were originally scheduled to leave the country on the President Hoover this morning, had to wait for another ship to depart because the ship was mistakenly damaged by aircraft and had already sailed directly to Japan last night. Therefore, this group of students studying in the United States and another group of about 500 foreigners preparing to leave Shanghai must wait for another ship to depart.

Handled by the Two Railway Bureaus; Implemented Starting Today

According to reliable information from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, although passenger trains between Beijing and Shanghai are still running as usual since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, parcel transportation has not been handled as usual due to a lack of vehicles. In order to facilitate merchants, an agreement has been reached with China Travel Service. Starting today, all parcels transported from Shanghai to various stations should first be sent to China Travel Service at No. 420 Sichuan Road, where transportation fees are paid and tickets are issued. Then, the agency will send the parcels to the West Station for loading and transportation. Parcels loaded at Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Wujin, Wuxian, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Songjiang, and other stations to Shanghai West Station will also be transported to the agency for merchants to pick up.

### Social Bureau Announces Borrowing Student Measures for War Zones

Schools in War Zones, Whether Registered or Not, Handled Similarly; Relocated Schools Accommodate Refugees to Facilitate School Opening

The Shanghai Social Bureau, considering that the war in the city has suddenly erupted, and many public and private secondary schools have fallen into war zones, with all students studying at those schools affected by the war and transportation obstructed, making it impossible for many to go to their original schools to continue their studies as usual, has formulated borrowing student measures for secondary schools in war zones in order to facilitate students' access to education and provide relief from loss of education. The measures were announced and implemented yesterday. The original text of the measures is recorded as follows: (1) All students studying in various grades of public and registered private secondary schools who are unable to continue their studies at their original schools due to the war may borrow to study at equivalent grades of equivalent public or registered private schools. (2) Public and registered private secondary schools should immediately fill out a borrowing certificate for students who request to borrow to study at other schools. The form is as follows: Borrowing Certificate (Affix student's photo) Student □□□, aged □ years, from □ Province □ County, studying in the □ department □ grade □ semester of the senior (middle) section of this school. The grade for this semester is passing (failing). Should promote (repeat) grade. This certificate is issued to certify the request to borrow to study. Public (Private) □ School Principal Date of the Republic of China. (3) Public and registered private secondary schools, when students from schools in war zones request to borrow to study, should review the submitted borrowing certificate, enroll them in the corresponding grade, and notify the original school of the borrowing student. After the borrowing period is over, the borrowing student's grades should be transferred to the original school. No documents should be given to the borrowing student. (4) The original school of the borrowing student, upon receiving the borrowing student's grades from the borrowing school after the borrowing student's borrowing period expires, should determine whether the student should be promoted or retained and graduate. (5) Public and private secondary schools in the city that intend to accept borrowing students should, in addition to handling matters in accordance with Item 3, submit a list of the names of the borrowing students, the names of the original schools, and the borrowing grades to the Bureau for verification within one month after the start of the school year. (6) Borrowing students who wish to transfer to the borrowing school should be strictly assessed by the borrowing school. If deemed qualified, the assessment results may be submitted to the competent education authority for verification and changed to regular students. (7) Students from unregistered private secondary schools in the war zone may also borrow to study at various public and registered private secondary schools, but the borrowing school, in addition to transferring the borrowing grades to the original school, shall not issue any documents or request to be changed to regular students. (8) These measures will cease on the date of the end of the war. (9) These measures will be implemented from the date of announcement. The refugee shelters run by the Shanghai Relief Committee accommodate and circulate refugees. There are still more than 70,000 people remaining. Most of the housing for the shelters run by the committee is borrowed from various secondary schools. Now that the number of refugees has increased rather than decreased, and the autumn semester is approaching for the schools, it will be a difficult problem. According to the reporter of Shenzhou News Agency, the relief authorities believe that this is a long-term and comprehensive war of resistance, and students' studies are of utmost importance. Therefore, all schools will open on schedule. A decision has been made on the placement of refugees. Refugees from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces will be completely repatriated in the near future. Repatriation has already begun. Those who cannot return will also be moved out of the schools and moved into various theaters, etc. As for refugees from Luodian, Wusong, Jiangwan, and other areas recently, because their homes are in that area, those who have nowhere to go will be temporarily placed in major temples.

### Schools to Open on Schedule

All War-Zone Teachers and Staff to Register at the Ant Library

Datong to Open on Schedule

Datong University and its affiliated middle school relocated their offices immediately after the outbreak of the war. The two departments have selected a school meeting and decided to follow the Ministry's order to open on September 20. New and old students have been notified through newspaper advertisements to register.

Chih Chih Reduces Tuition Fees

With the re-emergence of the Shanghai War, the Chih Chih College's Shuidao Road campus fell into the war zone. All teachers and staff are willing to fulfill their obligations to prevent students from losing their schooling and increase the strength of the war of resistance, and are working hard with the school authorities to plan for the opening of the school. For the time being, Zhensui Primary School at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Doumer is used as a temporary campus. In addition, due to the unusual nature of the social economy, all student fees, including tuition and miscellaneous fees, will be only 36 yuan for university students, 28 yuan for high school students, and 22 yuan for junior high school students. Borrowing students will be charged an additional registration fee of 1 yuan. The school is scheduled to open on September 20. Registration will begin on the 2nd, and the entrance examination for new students will be held on the 14th.

Zheng Shi to Hold Classes as Scheduled

Zheng Shi Middle School at No. 108 Rue Amiral Bayle in the French Concession of this port believes that the long-term war of resistance has just begun, and the education sector cannot be neglected. Therefore, classes will be held as scheduled today (the 1st). It is reported that although the school only accepts day students this year, there are already five or six hundred students enrolled, which is really not easy.

Register War-Zone Teachers

The Shanghai War-Zone Primary School Teachers and Staff Union will register teachers and staff who have suffered in the war zone at the Shanghai West Branch of the Ant Library in Jiapingfang, Route Cardinal Fesch (Avenue Edward VII), from today. The time is from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Registration will close on September 3.

Liang Cai Tutoring School

The Liang Cai Women's Tutoring School on Xiejiao Lane, Jing'an Temple Road in this city, has decided to open the semester on September 6 as originally scheduled. In order to reduce the burden on students, a payment plan has been established that allows students to pay only one-quarter of the total tuition fee at the beginning of the semester to enroll. In order to meet the needs of the extraordinary period, in addition to the original subjects, the school has also set up three special courses in anti-poison, nursing, and first aid for students to choose from. It is reported that in recent days, new and old students have been actively registering at the school. The fifth branch of the Liang Cai Vocational Tutoring School, which is attached to the school, will also enroll students at the same time and is scheduled to open on September 15.

### Kill One to Warn a Hundred

Traitors Arrested in Recent Days; All Executed on the Spot

Tao Maotou from Tongzhou (33 years old), under the instruction of Chen Fengsheng, sneaked into Nanshi on August 28 to gather military intelligence. He was seen loitering at the Dongyuanmen Alley entrance, acting suspiciously. He was apprehended by the police inspector of the 16th Bund Police Station of the Municipal Police Bureau. Three sheets of paper from the Chinese Communications Office were found on his person. He was sent to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. After strict interrogation by the military court, he confessed that he was instructed by Chen Fengsheng to serve as a spy for the Japanese enemy and to gather military intelligence. His criminal behavior was obvious and should be punished severely to serve as a warning. He was executed by firing squad in Nanshi yesterday afternoon. The instructing offender, Chen Fengsheng, has been ordered to be strictly apprehended.

Yesterday afternoon, two traitors, both about thirty years old, wearing blue cloth jackets, one in the Caoxiewan area of Nanshi, handing out ten cigarettes to passersby, claiming they were picked up from the ground. At that time, the passersby, thinking that there was no such thing as giving away what one has already eaten, handed the cigarettes to the members of the Citizen Training Corps. After breaking them, they found that they were actually filled with white medicinal powder and immediately arrested them. Another person went to the vegetable market in Sanjiao Street, bought beef, picked and chose at the stall, and took the opportunity to pour medicinal water on it. He was discovered and brought to the police station by the police. Both were presented to the General Bureau by the Dongjiadu Police Station for punishment.

In Sanlin, Yangsi, and other places in Pudong, traitors were discovered in recent days using strange lights and colored balls as signals. Fortunately, the local authorities discovered them early and arrested several people, who were executed on the spot. Yesterday, five more suspects were arrested. After interrogation, four were released on bail by local people, and the remaining one is currently under strict interrogation.

Minhang, Nanshi, was previously subjected to two large-scale bombings by enemy aircraft, resulting in the destruction of all buildings along the Pu ports and prosperous streets and lanes, and the deaths and injuries of many innocent civilians. Afterwards, various agencies such as the Shanghai County Government Public Security Bureau and local associations believed that there must have been traitors who had done something to cause such ruin of the town. After strict investigation, more than 20 traitors were discovered, who had evidence of communicating with the enemy. They were respectively detained and sent to the District Headquarters for punishment according to the law.

In Longhua and Xujiahui towns in the West, four important traitors were discovered by the group police, carrying poison powder and gathering military intelligence along the way, as well as more than ten men and women acting suspiciously. All have been sent to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation and disposal.

### Strictly Prevent Bandits from Causing Trouble

Cilianshe Yesterday Notified All Shelters

The Charity Organizations United Relief Association of this city notified all shelters yesterday: (1) Most of the refugees in the shelters are uneducated and cannot write. How can they not have relatives and friends in this city, making communication difficult. The shelters should designate staff to write letters for the refugees at appropriate times every day to find relatives and friends in this city and other places so that they can leave the shelters on their own. (2) Now, bandits are secretly plotting, using all kinds of schemes, and pretending to be refugees in an attempt to disturb the shelters. Strict prevention is necessary. There should be at least one general inspection every week, and when refugees ask for leave to return to the shelters, they should still be strictly searched at any time. (3) Beggars and tramps take the opportunity to pretend to be refugees and ask for shelter, often taking the opportunity to steal and commit crimes. The shelters should be aware of this at all times and expel them to prevent them from causing trouble. This is hereby notified. In addition, the Relief Committee of the Charity Organizations United Relief Association for War-Zone Refugees has accommodated a total of 23,740 refugees as of yesterday. In addition to continuing to accommodate them, from the 26th to the 30th, it has managed to send away a total of 971 people, including 898 on the Beijing-Shanghai line and 73 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Jiang Jianping, Yang Dexiu, Chen Zhengying, Wu Chengyu, and others were selected by the resettlement section of the association as escorts to ensure their safe transport.

### Relief and Resettlement News

Relief

The International Relief Committee yesterday morning dispatched priests and a large number of relief workers in four groups to various districts such as Hongkou, Yangshupu, Jiangwan, and Nanshi to provide relief. As of noon, it had rescued more than 1,000 refugees, who were temporarily provided with food and lodging in shelters on Route Massenet, Route Pichon, Route Luzon, etc. The committee is currently discussing with foreign shipping companies to send ships to transport them back to their hometowns.

The Jiangyin Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association has made extraordinary efforts in handling refugee accommodation and resettlement this time. It is estimated that the number of people sent back to their hometowns has reached 12,000. Recently, due to the expansion of the war and the wanton destruction of the rear by Japanese aircraft, many civilians have suffered. It is quite necessary to set up refugee hospitals for relief.

The schools in the special district of this city that have been used as refugee shelters have been ordered by the Social Bureau to restore their original functions in preparation for the start of the school year. However, it is heard that due to the intensifying war and the increase in refugees, the schools have been notified again by the Social Bureau to continue to be used as refugee shelters temporarily.

The members of the Shanghai Lawyers Association Relief Group have accommodated a total of more than 300 refugees since they decided to start accommodating refugees. The association has found that there are still many refugees who have nowhere to go in various places and intends to expand the accommodation of refugees on the third floor, but it is now difficult to accommodate any more. It has been decided to accommodate refugees on the third floor.

In addition to continuing to accommodate them, from the 26th to the 30th, it has managed to send away a total of 971 people, including 898 on the Beijing-Shanghai line and 73 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line.

The Red Swastika Society yesterday received three civilian ships allocated by the Shanghai Relief Committee, which were towed by small boats, and sent 612 refugees from the areas of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang on the boats, escorted by Xin Jisi, a member of the relief team, to Suzhou and Wuxi, where they disembarked. The Swastika Societies in various places in Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang will separately find ways to send them back to their homes.

The Wujiang Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association is now setting up a relief association at No. 31 Tongchunfang, Baker Road to register fellow villagers who are refugees. It is heard that the association yesterday sent the sixth batch of more than 140 people back to their hometowns. Those who wish to return to their hometowns should register at the association as soon as possible.

### More Than Two Thousand Luodian Refugees Are Stranded in Beixinjing

Urgently Awaiting Relief

After the enemy invaders landed and ravaged Luodian Town, although our various armies chased and annihilated the enemy cavalry, the local peace has been completely destroyed, and the villagers have fled in all directions. There are more than two thousand men, women, old and young. The Baoshan Association of Fellow Villagers in Shanghai has been sending special vehicles to their hometown for relief in recent days. However, due to the difficulty of entering the special zone, they are still stranded in Beixinjing. The association urgently hopes that if any fellow villagers associations in Shanghai have refugee shelters, they can release some space for the association to accommodate them. The association's fellow villagers are starving and wandering in the suburbs of Shanghai, urgently in need of rescue.

### Tong, Ru, Chong, and Hai Will Continue to Send Refugees

The Shanghai Association of Fellow Villagers from the five counties of Tong, Ru, Chong, and Hai is now renting a ship from a certain British company to continue sending refugees directly to Nantong. The sailing date is currently being negotiated with the shipping company. It is reported that definite news may be available before noon today. Refugees who wish to return to their hometown can inquire about the sailing time (boarding time will be from 3 pm to 5 pm) and assembly point at the association's temporary liaison office at 19 Chun Geng Lane, San Maoge Bridge, Avenue Edward VII.

### Wartime Donation Coordination Association to Be Established

Since the outbreak of the war, donations from all walks of life have been exceptionally enthusiastic. However, there is often an imbalance between supply and demand. Now, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Xu Xinliu, Ji Kunsheng, and others have jointly organized a Wartime Donation Coordination Association to connect various relief organizations to coordinate the supply and demand of various donations. The preparatory office is currently located at Huatong Co., Ltd., 280 Jiujiang Road, and will be formally established soon.

### Pawnshops in Hongkou District Relocated Away from War Zone Awaiting Redemption

Valuable Ornaments Safely Moved Out

Hongkou area, before the war, had a large population, so there were many pawnshops. Since the outbreak of the war, the area has become a front line, and most of the residents have moved to the concession area. The safety of the pawnshops is of great concern to the pawnshop customers. Yesterday, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Hongkou area pawnshops have mostly safely left the war zone. In addition to bulky items such as wooden furniture, packages, and cotton quilts, valuable ornaments have also been safely moved out and have been rented houses in safe locations in the British and French concessions, waiting for the pawnshop customers to redeem them. The pawnshops belonging to the above situation include An, Deyu, Yongde, Baofeng, Jufeng, Juchang, Chuangxing, Dongxing, Yongda, Yifeng, Chunxing, Tongchang, Baoyu, Renfeng, Yongfeng, Guangxing, Huaxing, Jiayu, Yongyu, Xixing, Luchang, Youchang, Baoyuan (Heji), Baoyuan (Jianji), etc., a total of 24.

### Wartime Weekly Urgently勸Japanese Soldiers

Chinese scholars who returned from studying in Japan recently, in view of the tyranny of the violent Japan, specially published a wartime weekly by the Far East Magazine, exposing its internal crisis and military and political situation, and published a letter to Japanese soldiers, pointing out from theory and fact that the lives of the people in their country are becoming more and more dangerous due to the September 18th and January 28th incidents, and that the current Songhu War has suffered heavy losses, with more than 10,000 casualties, all of which are the result of the brutality and selfishness of their few warlords, the soldiers are the victims, and their families are the ones who suffer. The language is extremely painful and important, and it has been printed in Japanese and sent to the front by planes for distribution.

### Beware of Fraudulent Fundraising

The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association and local associations have initiated donations for the current war of resistance, all of which are collected by designated banks and newspapers, and no one is sent to solicit donations on the streets. Recently, it has been learned that some people are soliciting donations in the name of the association. It is said that many people have been deceived. The association has previously published an announcement in the newspaper, requesting that anyone who encounters such impersonators be arrested and dealt with.

### Fierce Battles in Wusong and Luodian as the Enemy Stubbornly Advances

Our Troops in Wusong Charge and Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat, the Enemy's Forces Are Scattered and Defeated / The Main Force of the Enemy Troops in Luodian Is Still Surrounded by Us / Street Fighting Between the Two Sides in the Area of the Eight Character Bridge in North Station

According to reports from the front this morning: ㊀ In the Wusong and Zhang Huabang Yunzao Hong areas, the enemy again secretly landed in the Wusong Town area yesterday, with about five or six hundred people, concentrating their naval, land, and air forces to attack, with a particularly fierce momentum. At dusk, our fresh troops arrived and launched a counter-offensive in three routes, charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, which was extremely fierce. The enemy responded in a panic and suffered heavy losses. ㊁ In the Luodian area, there have been fierce battles from last night to this morning, but the main force of the enemy troops is still surrounded by us on three sides: east, south, and west. Although the enemy is stubborn, it cannot break through. ㊂ In the area of the Eight Character Bridge and North Station, our military defense lines are consolidated. Although the enemy has been constantly attacking, they have all been severely attacked and retreated by our troops.

### Bloody Battle Near Wusong

The Enemy Attacked with All Their Might and Great Momentum / We Launched a Major Offensive, Charging and Engaging in Hand-to-Hand Combat

According to confirmed information, the original enemy troops in the Zhang Huabang, Yunzaobang, and along the Hushang Road area, about one regiment, a total of about two thousand people, have been closely besieged by our army for many days. Although they have repeatedly tried to break through the encirclement, they have all failed. In the area along the river east of Wusong Town, there were about two or three hundred remaining enemies who were also surrounded by our army and cut off north of Yunzaobang. It is difficult to gain a foothold without returning to the ship. In order to rescue the remaining troops there, the enemy suddenly mobilized its naval, land, and air forces simultaneously from the afternoon of yesterday to launch a fierce attack on our military positions north and west of Yunzaobang. At the same time, about five or six hundred people landed on the river surface in Wusong Town, and immediately joined the original remaining troops to charge our front line of the town. Our army immediately rose up and pounced fiercely, fighting fiercely for several hours, engaging in more than ten hand-to-hand combats. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. After the evening (31st), our fresh troops arrived and launched a major offensive together from the south, north, and west. The enemy ships and our □□ land artillery exchanged fire, and the gunfire did not stop all night. The sound of machine guns and rifles was connected, making it impossible to distinguish. The intensity of the battle can be seen. It gradually stopped until this morning. In this battle, our army charged and engaged in hand-to-hand combat more than ten times. The enemy responded in a panic and suffered heavy casualties. The enemy troops in that area are still surrounded by our army on three sides. There were continued fierce battles near Wusong Town last night, with mutual casualties. The enemy is trying to build fortifications near the town. Our □□□ units are fiercely attacking the enemy.

### Fierce Fighting Outside Luodian Town

The Enemy Launched Another Fierce Counter-Offensive Last Night / Our Troops Also Drenched in Blood and Pounced Fiercely at the Enemy

This afternoon, a certain military agency received a report from the front that the enemy troops northwest of Luodian had been repelled by our army and occupied their camp. The enemy troops launched a fierce counter-offensive against our army's positions in Luodian Town last night, under the cover of their warships and artillery. Our army immediately rose up to counterattack, and the battle was extremely fierce. The sound of guns and artillery continued without interruption. After 6:00 am today, more than a dozen enemy aircraft came to assist in the battle. Our loyal and brave soldiers, although under the heavy pressure of enemy artillery fire, still drenched in blood and pounced fiercely at the enemy.

In addition, according to news, our army attacked the enemy in the Luodian area last night to this morning (1st), and made considerable progress. The enemy, because it was attacked from all sides, could not break through, and although it stubbornly resisted, its morale was panicked, its casualties were heavy, and its combat effectiveness was greatly reduced.

### Enemy Troops Still Occupy Caowang Temple

Hoping to Break Through the Heavy Encirclement / But It Is Difficult to Succeed Because of Our Firm Defense

According to confirmed information, the main force of the enemy troops in the Caowang Temple area between Luodian and Liuhe is still entrenched in the area, hoping to break through the heavy encirclement. Our side has strong fortifications and no fear, which only shows the enemy's desperate situation.

### Street Fighting Occurred Near North Station

The Municipal Council Proves That We Are Holding the Station / The Enemy's Constant Attacks Have Been Repelled by Us

According to the Municipal Council, the following is a report from 6:00 pm yesterday (31st) to 10:00 am today (September 1st): In the northern district, it was reported that street fighting had occurred near the North Railway Station. Five fires broke out near the station, three of which were burning fiercely at 7:00 pm yesterday. The station is still occupied by the Chinese.

It was reported that several Japanese planes flew over the concession last night and dropped several bombs west of the Zhabei North Railway Station, as well as several flares near the station and west of the Fanwangdu Bridge. There were no stray bullets or damage in the concession. The reports from various police stations north of the Suzhou River this morning all stated that "everything is calm and safe."

In addition, according to news, our military defense lines in the area of the Eight Character Bridge and North Station are solid. The enemy attempted to attack repeatedly last night, but was severely attacked and routed by our troops.

### Enemy Ships Often Cruise Near Chongming

According to a telegram from Chongming County, enemy ships have been cruising near the island in recent days, but the area is still quiet as of the time of the telegram.

### Enemy Reinforcements Arrive at Songkou

One Ship Sails to the Liuhe Area / The Rest Gather at the Mouth of Wusong

After being besieged by our army for several days, the enemy suffered heavy losses. Therefore, at around 11:00 pm last night (31st), enemy reinforcements arrived at the mouth of Wusong on eight merchant ships. One of them, protected by another warship, sailed to the Liuhe area, while the rest gathered fifty nautical miles outside the mouth of Wusong.

### Enemy Ships Continue to Transport Munitions to Shanghai

Since the enemy's three ships, Shuberu Maru, Tensho Maru, and Toba Maru, arrived in Shanghai one after another and unloaded a large batch of military supplies and ammunition, another enemy transport ship and a merchant ship arrived in Shanghai last night. The transport ship was docked at the North Wharf of China Merchants, and since last night, thirty to forty Japanese soldiers have been unloading ammunition and weapons. When the reporter passed by the area at 11:00 am today, he saw a steel cannon being transported from the ship to the wharf. Another merchant ship (name unknown) was docked at the Huishan Wharf, and sixty to seventy Japanese soldiers were also unloading ammunition and weapons. At the same time, more than a dozen war horses were unloaded from the ship. The enemy's urgent reinforcements show the unfavorable situation of the war after the invasion of Shanghai and the magnitude of the losses.

### Enemy Troops in Hongkou Rotate Day and Night

Reserves Defend During the Day / Regular Army Launches Counter-Offensives at Night

According to confirmed information, the enemy in Hongkou has been surrounded by our army for a long time. Now, in order to adjust, the enemy troops are defended by marines and reservists during the day, and regular army launches counter-offensives at night. However, because the positions cannot be deployed and our army's defenses are tight, it is difficult for the enemy to succeed.

### Enemy Troops in Nanhui Cannot Land

The Rafts Are Dozens of Miles from the Coast / It Is Not Clear Where They Will Be Used

According to confirmed information, according to reports from Nanhui, the news that enemy ships were preparing large rafts, seemingly intending to land, has now been verified that the rafts are still dozens of miles from the coast, and it is not clear where the enemy will use them.

### Enemy Planes Bomb Pudong at Night

Killing Innocent People Is a Shameful Act

Several Japanese planes suddenly launched a night attack on Pudong at about 3:00 am this morning. After circling for a short time, they dropped several bombs one after another. This kind of brutal behavior by Japanese planes is purely aimed at killing innocent civilians. Because there are many eyes and ears during the day, they changed to bombing at night, which is extremely shameless.

Enemy planes released many flares over Shanghai North last night.

### Enemy Artillery Bombardment Has No Target

Enemy Planes Drop Bombs Mostly in Remote Rural Areas / Only Allowing Helpless Refugees to Suffer Their Poison

Japanese artillerymen and Japanese planes are all incompetent bandits who only want to cause trouble and are of no help to the military. Their artillery bombardment and bombs are all in non-combat areas, far away from the front, at least more than ten miles away. Various situations are often seen in the newspaper. But yesterday, enemy artillery again fired aimlessly at Tangqiao Zhangjiazhai, at least twenty miles away from the war zone, destroying two houses of Zhang Tangsheng's family, and the people were slightly injured. Also, Japanese planes bombed the mud wall circle in Pudong, dropping three bombs in total, none of which detonated. Beicaizhen and Zhangjiangzha in Nanhui County are both remote rural areas, not only without soldiers, but also without police encirclement. A group of refugees from Shanghai, the poorer ones, have all fled to this place, so they are sitting on the ground, and the population is large. However, Japanese planes actually bombed them repeatedly, injuring the pitiful refugees, without any humanitarianism. Therefore, a group of refugees fled to Zhoujiadu, Yangsi Bridge, and other places in Pudong, and Japanese planes and artillery fire indiscriminately shot and bombed, causing more injuries. This is truly venomous.

Although there was no fierce bombardment by the Japanese warships anchored in the Hongkou area for several days, they fired three or four cannons every night. At 3:00 am this morning, they fired three cannons at the Puhui area, which was very loud. According to those familiar with the situation, there are more than ten Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River, and more than twenty outside Songkou. A large amount of coal is needed every day, but the Japanese coal piled up in the Japanese warehouse in Zhangjiabang area of Pudong, because the section of the Huangpu River from Sixteen Pupu has been blocked by us, is actually our war trophy and cannot be transported. Only the lower reaches of the Yangjing Laosanjing and its Changzhan Xin Sanjing Xin Mitsubishi lines still have a large amount of coal available, but going to transport it during the day is afraid of our army's shooting, so it is secretly transported at night. The method is to fire a few cannons in advance. Seeing that our army has no movement, they dare to land to take coal. Their actions are hateful and ridiculous.

### Enemy Troops Cut Off Huangpu River Pontoons

Central News Agency: In order to facilitate landing, the enemy troops have cut off the pontoons on both sides of the Huangpu River in many places and dragged them to the place where they are preparing to land with warships, so as to build temporary wharves. When the reporter crossed the Huangpu River today (1st), he saw that five or six pontoons on the Huangpu River side of the Tai Tong Coal Depot opposite Huishan Wharf had been cut off by the enemy troops for use.

### Traitors Are Everywhere, Impossible to Exterminate

Young Female Beggars Deliberately Pretending to Be Lame / Cheap Straw Hats Cause Many People to Be Implicated

The heartless and crazy traitors are really a great disaster recently. A guest from a town in Pudong said that the various ghostly tricks of the traitors are both hateful and annoying. Three days ago, near Zhoupu in Nanhui County, Pudong, two young female beggars suddenly appeared, one of whom deliberately pretended to be lame, but the situation of her limping was unnatural, so she was seen by the police. Upon inspection, it was found to be a forgery and was immediately arrested. Another female beggar actually bought Qianmen brand cigarettes from a cigarette paper store and smoked them, but how could a female beggar smoke such high-end cigarettes, so she was also captured and sent to the authorities for execution. Also, traitors in Pudong are emerging one after another. The male traitors all wear a hard straw hat, and in the brim of the hat, there is a paper round seal of the Japanese emblem. This secret was detected by our side, and the search is very strict. The traitors are afraid in the inland areas, so they sell the straw hats at a low price of four jiao each to the country, and a group of villagers, greedy for cheap, think that the refugees are selling them cheaply, and buy them one after another. As a result, as many as thirty or forty people were implicated and arrested. However, because the peaceful villagers all have guarantors such as the village head, the authorities understand their situation and acquit many of them. Therefore, during this time of tight situation, the public should not be greedy for small profits, causing great harm.

### Our Army Fights Bravely Against Japan, the British Are Extremely Admiring

Recognizing That the Japanese Aggression Will Be Difficult to Achieve What It Wants / The Final Result Depends on a Long-Term Struggle

[London] Photos of the Shanghai War, photos of the Japanese flagship Izumo being bombed by Chinese planes, and news of the Sino-Japanese War are now filling London newspapers, occupying the most important position. Generally speaking, British sympathy is entirely with China, and they have the utmost respect for the brave resistance of Chinese soldiers. General public opinion believes that Japan will not be able to achieve what it wants this time. Regarding the war outside the mouth of Wusong, although the Japanese army used the moment of ceasefire to make active preparations, Reuters reporters deeply felt after interviewing various parties that the final result would only be known after a long-term war. Furthermore, if China can continue to support its military supplies, Japan will be unsustainable. Regarding the Sino-Soviet treaty, its importance here is recognized in the spiritual aspect, and it is not impossible to supply China with military equipment. How the United States will act is very worthy of attention. According to a report from the Washington reporter of the Morning Post, the isolationists have not yet been able to achieve their goal of announcing neutrality, and the trend of the US authorities has been to actively cooperate with Britain and France. According to the reporter's opinion, even if neutrality is implemented at present, it cannot change the general impression of American policy. The United States will continue to cooperate with other countries to maintain peace in China and protect its interests in East Asia. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources in London, if the United States is willing to take more active action this time to put pressure on Japan, then Britain and France will immediately respond and cooperate, which goes without saying. However, there are no signs of this matter yet. The financial weakness of Japan and its reliance on important raw materials from abroad are highly valued here. The Manchester Guardian claims that general Japanese opinion has expressed concern about the future of Japanese export business even before the Shanghai incident occurred. (Reuters telegram from Central News Agency on the 31st)

### US Ambassador to Britain Returns Home to Meet with US Government Authorities

Related to the Far East Situation / British Cruiser Prepares to Sail to Shanghai

[Washington] US Ambassador to Britain Bingham returned home yesterday to report on his duties, and today he met with Secretary of State Hull and is scheduled to meet with President Roosevelt tomorrow to report. The authorities concerned announced that Ambassador Bingham will return to London to take office in half a month. According to well-informed sources in Britain, Bingham's return home is related to the Far East incident, and President Roosevelt will consult with Bingham on the Far East issue. (Havas telegram from Central News Agency on the 11th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull stated today that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the US fleet in Asia, ordered American merchant ships not to dock in Shanghai, which is only a temporary precaution. Observers interpreted this statement to mean that the State Department does not advocate withdrawing American businesses in China from the front. (Reuters telegram from Central News Agency on the 31st)

### Ambassador Wang Apologizes to the US for the Case of the President Hoover

Our Government Handles the Matter Quickly / The US Authorities Express Satisfaction

[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting visited US Secretary of State Hull today regarding the bombing of the President Hoover, expressing the Chinese government's deep regret and stating that the Chinese government is willing to bear the responsibility for the unfortunate incident and provide prompt compensation. Afterwards, reporters interviewed Hull and asked if the US government was satisfied with China's apology. Hull did not want to say much, but said that the United States was very grateful for China's quick expression of responsibility after the incident. Furthermore, the Chinese government attaches great importance to this matter and has decided to subject the pilot who caused the accident to military law and give him severe punishment, and has proposed various compensation methods. (Reuters telegram from Central News Agency on the 31st)

### Japan Rejects British Demand

[London] The Tokyo correspondent of the Standard Evening News claimed that Japan intends to reject the British government's request for Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British ambassador to China, to be injured by a Japanese plane. The correspondent learned that Japan is only willing to make a formal apology and refuses to provide guarantees that similar incidents will not occur in the war zone. Japan will probably ask Britain to notify the Japanese authorities in advance if British diplomats travel in the war zone in the future. (National Haitong telegram on the 31st)

### No Fighting in Tangguantun Yesterday

[Jinan] The fighting in the front line of Tangguantun was fierce, and stopped from last night to this morning. Heavy rain today, no fighting all day. The staff of Tangguantun Station are working in the horse breeding office. (Special telegram on the 31st)

### Japanese Residents in Qingdao to Be Evacuated Soon

[Qingdao] Today, another 1,200 Japanese residents returned to Moji. The remaining Japanese residents are waiting for ships and will be evacuated in two days. It has been found that the market has gradually become active since today. Chinese merchants have resumed business, and the Yizhong Tobacco Company of the British company is scheduled to resume work on the first day. Many male and female workers have also returned to Qingdao in recent days. (Special telegram on the 31st)

### Miscellaneous Comments

— Phase

The establishment of a non-aggression treaty between China and the Soviet Union. Because the timing was not good. It caused attention from all sides, so newspapers from various countries. Have something to say about this. The Soviet newspaper said, "That is, a new tool to maintain collective security." The German newspaper said, "The Far Eastern situation will therefore become more serious." The implication. Clearly self-evident. The American newspaper said, "I am afraid that Germany will have an excuse." Timid psychology. As seen in the lungs and liver. And the most mysterious thing. It is the British newspaper's argument. Said that this treaty is "absolutely harmless." The so-called non-aggression treaty. It is a peace treaty. Peace treaty. Originally harmless. And the British newspaper lightly added the four words "absolutely harmless" to comment on this matter. Irrelevant. And the weight is self-evident. It can be said that the words are wonderful in the world.

Travel Correspondence

### Glimpses of Rear Area Sentiment Amidst the War of Resistance (3)

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

Difficult Questions

During my flight from Kunming to Chengdu, I was discussing the scenery along the way with a certain Mr. from the Ministry of Health, such as how majestic the mountains and rivers of Kunming are, how extraordinary Mount Emei in Sichuan is, and how wonderful it is to look at the clouds from above. Another American fellow passenger suddenly interrupted. He first pointed down through the clouds at a large river, whose beginning and end were not visible, and asked us, "Is that the Jinsha River?" We fixed our eyes on the river and saw two small steamboats sailing, and on the banks, there was a large city shimmering. The last time we flew over, in broad daylight, we recognized it as Yibin City, so we affirmed, "Yes, it is the Jinsha River." Later, after consulting a map, we discussed the North China issue. The American then pointed to places like Shuangtai and Lugou Bridge and angrily asked, "Beijing is the head of North China. The 'Beining,' 'Jinpu,' 'Pinghan,' and 'Pinghuan' railways converge in Beijing, just like the limbs supporting the head. Japan first took Yingtai, disregarding that the left arm and left leg of Beijing had already been cut off. Now, they are coming to take Lugou Bridge, naturally to take the right arm and right leg. With the limbs gone, the head is certainly not secure. The Japanese are being pardoned despite their misdeeds, and China has already suffered a great loss. China originally has a massive army, so why hasn't it launched a large-scale war of resistance?" I couldn't recall a suitable response at the moment, so I just gave a bitter smile. Mr. waited for him to leave before softly laughing and saying, "It's best to answer him by saying that it concerns military secrets and cannot be disclosed." But in the end, I found it difficult to say.

Chengdu's Sentiment

As the plane landed with a flap on the muddy Chengdu station, the local military police authorities, as usual, sent people to inquire about the passengers' origins. We exchanged surnames and, in the process, I inquired about the disaster situation in Sichuan. An officer surnamed Yan from the Pacification Commissioner's Office simply replied with a casual tone, "The drought is over, but the floods are terrible," and then, with an extremely urgent attitude, he turned around and asked me, "What do you think will be the solution to the North China problem? Will there be war or not? Are the sentiments of the Yunnan authorities and the people very strong?" A moment later, a car from the airline took us into the city, and Mr. Yong Yan guided us to the Continental Hotel, where the manager also asked him about the news of the situation, "Will there be war or not?" The 'war' here naturally refers to a large-scale war of resistance. The people of Chengdu are known for their leisurely lifestyle, but at this moment, their inner spirit is also very tense.

It was already dusk, so it was inconvenient to visit the local authorities. I had to temporarily act as a "road inspector." I strolled through several streets, looking to see which stores were still promoting enemy goods. But to this day, we have not righteously severed economic ties with the enemy. Moreover, there is a large amount of enemy smuggling and dumping at low prices. Greedy merchants, muddle-headed, continue to sell enemy goods as usual, which is naturally intolerable.

Entering Zhongshan Park, I found several types of declarations and leaflets. Some were distributed by military groups, and some were issued by gentlemen and people like Tang Zongyao. The sight was colorful and numerous. Summarizing their intent, it was nothing more than to awaken the public, urge the government, and launch a national war of resistance. Another one, signed "Mole" from the city, also contained the meaning of criticizing the virtuous, reminiscent of the Spring and Autumn Annals. The writing was unfamiliar, and the paper was brightly colored, probably written by a small shop clerk or worker, but his consciousness was enough to represent the broad masses, so it particularly attracted people's attention.

The Stratagem of Buffer Zones

When I arrived in Chengdu, Pingjin was already in grave danger, but had not yet fallen. Qi Xieyuan, Zhang Yunrong, Zhang Muzhong, and their like were conducting so-called peace negotiations. People here mostly expressed suspicion and opposition. The director of the Sichuan-Kang Chengdu News Inspection Office, Mr. Shu, when I visited him at his home, unexpectedly and naturally talked about this issue. Mr. Shu believed that the so-called "buffer zones and buffer figures" were a clever plan by the enemy to control China. The following is his high-level discussion on the topic, which is indeed worth pondering:

Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, Japan's claims of peace are treacherous and unpredictable. However, based on the lessons we have learned in the past, we should have the firmest belief to show the whole country and act in unison. Only then will enemy spies not be able to harm us, and our territory will not be lost. What is the firmest belief? That is, we should unanimously oppose the enemy's scheme of using Chinese to control Chinese. To put it more clearly, it is to oppose the enemy's request to demarcate buffer zones and cultivate buffer figures. The Japanese once said, "North China is a buffer zone between China and Japan, and friction must be avoided. Therefore, we need to promote buffer figures to govern it," which is truly absurd. The "buffer" that the Japanese speak of is actually similar to "special." A buffer zone is equivalent to an "occupied area," and a buffer figure is a traitor. If we formally and clearly acknowledge that the enemy can come to a buffer zone within our territory and place buffer figures on our political stage, wouldn't we be foolishly committing suicide? Therefore, our government and people should all believe that there is a proper way to solve the Sino-Japanese problem, which is that Japan must first recognize China as an independent country. And all demarcation of buffer zones and cultivation of buffer figures are schemes by the enemy to win without fighting, which should be firmly opposed to the end. If there are any buffer figures who conduct activities in buffer zones to be cultivated and promoted by the Japanese, then they are definitely not Chinese and should be dealt with by the means used to deal with traitors. We originally admire justice and need peace, but we must still safeguard national independence. Anyone who violates this limit can only be fought with all our might!

### Enemy Planes Attempt to Harass Anhui Fail

Our Air Force Fights Back and Shoots Down Several Enemy Planes, The Captured Enemy Pilots Immediately Escorted to Nanjing

Wuhu Dispatch, Enemy planes have recently been dispatched to reconnaissance in the interior of Anhui Province. Over the past ten days or so, good news has been frequently reported. Our Air Force has fought bravely, and the enemy planes have repeatedly suffered disastrous defeats and have not succeeded. According to investigations, the enemy planes shot down in Anhui include two in Guangde, two in Jiangningzhen, and one in Tianchang. The one in Guangde was a heavy bomber. After crashing to the ground, the fuselage was completely destroyed. Inside, there was a machine gun, two parachutes, several Chinese and Japanese maps, and various scattered objects. Of the pilots, one died on the spot, and the other four all fled. It was later learned that the four men wandered to a village in the southern part of Guangde, lost their way, and were captured by farmers in a miserable state and sent to the county government, and will be escorted to Nanjing for disposition. The one in Tianchang was also a heavy bomber, shot down by our Air Force with machine guns. All four Japanese on board were killed. Recently, there have still been frequent attempts to disturb the area. On the 23rd at 1:40 AM, when several enemy planes attempted to attack the capital, two were chased by our Air Force to Daqiaozhen, 30 li away from Wuhu. Unable to advance, the enemy planes hastily turned back and fled east. On the same morning at 4:40 AM, several enemy planes were spotted in the sky over Anqing, dropping six bombs before fleeing.

### Visiting Second Lieutenant Ruan Puxun, Sky Warrior

(Special Report from This Newspaper) I was fortunate enough to meet our sky warrior, Second Lieutenant Ruan Puxun, at the military hospital on ×× Road.

On the morning of the 22nd, he was injured while dropping bombs on the enemy's position in Liuhe and was admitted to the hospital that evening. The next morning, the reporter learned of this news and immediately drove to visit, but was politely refused three times by the hospital staff. Mr. Ruan's injuries were minor, but he needed quiet rest, and he was forbidden from talking. Until today, on my fourth visit, I was finally able to meet our aerial combatant, Mr. Ruan, under the guidance of Mr. Liu from the hospital.

Mr. Ruan was lying on a cot in the corridor, looking very energetic. When the reporter greeted him, he seemed to have known in advance that a guest would be visiting him, as he nodded to me with a smile. After a few casual remarks, we had the following conversation:

Where is Mr. Ruan from? How old are you this year?

Fujian. Twenty-five this year.

Could you briefly tell me what happened that day you were injured?

That morning, our planes were ordered to drop bombs on the enemy's position in Liuhe. When I was flying in the sky, suddenly eight or nine enemy planes surrounded me from behind. Because I was outnumbered, I was hit by several machine gun bullets in my ankle and passed out at that time...

The country treats us too well, and the people treat us even more warmly. I am truly sorry. He firmly remembered the regret that two bombs had not hit the enemy's position.

Is there no problem with Ruan Guangsheng's leg?

He slightly moved his leg and said with a smile:

It's just inconvenient to move, but there's probably no problem.

I silently thought, "Where there is a green mountain, there is no fear of running out of firewood." Mr. Ruan was probably thinking the same thing as me, and we couldn't help but smile at each other.

When I said goodbye and came out, the sun was shining strongly in the sky, which was the symbol of "rising like the sun."
