The strength of the Red Army increases year by year, its tactics are innovative, and its training is excellent, long feared by the enemy. However, Fascist spies have not abandoned their attempts to sabotage us, so we must remain vigilant against their conspiracies." (National Telegram, 6th)

Tank formations and mechanized units all participated, making it an unprecedented spectacle. The intention of the Soviet authorities is to use this to instill fear in the Fascist countries.

[Moscow] In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the revolution, the Izvestia newspaper published an article describing the dangers of Fascism, stating that the people should firmly remember Stalin's warning that the enemy is only waiting for a suitable opportunity to attack the Soviet Union. The flames of war are already burning fiercely outside the borders of the Soviet Union. Abyssinia, Spain, and China have all been engulfed in the destructive flames of barbaric slaughter. Fascism endangers all nations. We have dealt with the deceitful schemes of warmongers before, and we will deal with them again. We do not desire war, but we are not afraid of war, and we are prepared for war. The article also praised the Soviet state. Stalin today attended a conference at the Moscow Soviet Grand Theatre, along with high-ranking officials and union leaders. Several foreign Soviet labor delegations also participated in the celebration. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegram, 7th)

### Third International Issues Declaration Calling for Unity Among Democratic Nations

[Moscow] The Third International of the Soviet Union, in celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the revolution, issued a declaration calling on democratic forces worldwide to unite in support of China and Spain, stating, "Whether or not the Fascist bandits can inflict a world war upon humanity can be seen in the outcome of the wars in China and Spain." The declaration also advocated for the establishment of an international workers' front to oppose Fascism. Regarding the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Third International declared that the workers within these three countries, in light of the achievements of twenty years of Soviet socialism, will seize the opportunity of a second war to incite revolution, just as the workers in Spain are already fighting for a new model of a democratic republic. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegram)

[Moscow] Today marks the twentieth anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution. The Executive Committee of the Communist International issued a letter to workers worldwide yesterday, stating, "Nearly twenty years have passed since the end of the First Imperialist World War. Now, the catastrophe of a Second Imperialist World War is imminent. This war will undoubtedly be more brutal than the last. The Fascist Party has plunged a quarter of humanity into the ravages of war, while the bourgeois democratic nations have indulged these crimes of the Fascist Party. The laboring masses in all capitalist countries have now begun to recognize the reasons for past failures. Today, the People's Front movement has made significant progress in both capitalist and Fascist dictatorships. The People's Front movement in France has expanded the democratic rights and economic interests of workers. The Chinese nation is now engaged in a heroic resistance, defending its homeland against the aggression of Japanese Fascist warlords. Workers in all countries around the world should strive to provide assistance to the heroic struggles of the Chinese and Spanish nations, for defending China and Spain is to safeguard world peace." The conclusion put forward the following slogans: "Long live the People's Front against Fascism and the anti-war movement!" "Down with capitalism! Long live the world proletarian revolution!"

### Fascist Bloc Formed; World Peace Threatened

Washington Government Authorities Feel Uneasy; Japan's Aggressive Ambitions Are No Small Matter; Unrestrained Ambitions Will Cause the Powers to Burn Themselves

[Washington] The anti-communist pact signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan has caused considerable unease within the U.S. government, as the policy of ideological blocs runs counter to the peace policy advocated by the U.S. government. Furthermore, the policy pursued by Germany, Italy, and Japan will inevitably lead to the launch of a holy war against communism. If so, it will inevitably have an impact on South America, which is why the U.S. government is deeply apprehensive. The New York Times stated, "If right-wing revolutions occur in South American countries, the revolutionaries may be aided by countries participating in the anti-communist bloc. This is a matter of great concern, and Portugal may also join the anti-communist pact in the future. That country is related to several South American countries. If so, it may inevitably lead to European countries interfering in American affairs, which is closely related to the vital interests of the United States." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 7th)

[Washington] While the State Department authorities have made no formal statement regarding the Rome Anti-Comintern Pact, in private they say that this pact will only increase the tension in the world. From this point on, the line between Fascist and quasi-Fascist countries opposing democracy will become more solidified. Even the prospects for the Brussels Conference will become more difficult due to Japan's increasingly tough stance. Some believe that Germany and Italy may use this pact to cultivate Fascism in Latin America. Officials have not criticized this point, but they are aware that European countries have long wanted to Fascistize Central and South America. (National Telegram, 6th)

[San Francisco] The famous traveler Gothe, speaking today at the Republican Club here, stated that according to his observations, the ambitions of Japan's ruling class are by no means satisfied with the conquest of China. After conquering China, they will follow it with the conquest of British India, and even the Dutch East Indies will be difficult to avoid. The third step will be the conquest of Latin America. According to Gothe, there are currently thousands of Japanese people traveling from Peru to Brazil. (National Telegram, 6th)

[Rome] In addition to unanimously endorsing Italy's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact, Fascist newspapers today also praised Japan's naval superiority in the Pacific, saying that although the number of Japanese warships is comparable to that of the United States, Japan has the advantage in the Pacific because it takes the U.S. fleet twenty days to reach the Philippine Islands, while Japan only needs three days. These remarks are clearly aimed at the anti-Fascist and anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States, and can also serve as a warning to the united front of Britain, the United States, and France at the Brussels Conference. At the same time, the newspapers also said that President Roosevelt's Chicago speech has deeply convinced Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that the United States intends to abandon its isolationist policy.

### U.S. Navy's Next Year Building Program

[Washington] Secretary of the Navy Swanson presented his annual report to President Roosevelt, indicating that next year the United States will implement a shipbuilding program that breaks records in peacetime. The report described naval affairs within the fiscal year ending in late June 1937, advocating for appropriations to build two new battleships, which had been previously mentioned, and also advocating for the construction of two cruisers costing 16 million yuan each, and four auxiliary ships.

### Two Paths the United States Can Follow

Believes that Force Is Necessary to Make Japan Yield

—Mr. Beverley's Sound Argument—

[Washington] American Far East expert Mr. Beverley published an article in the "American Magazine" today, stating that the United States only has two paths to take in the current Sino-Japanese War: one is to participate in the war, and the other is to stand idly by. Mr. Beverley also said that since his return to the United States, he has been shocked by the divisions in public opinion regarding the Far East issue, as these divisions pose a great danger to the United States. In his opinion, force is necessary to make Japan yield; otherwise, there is no so-called exerting pressure on Japan. (National Telegram, 6th)

### Japanese Ships Invade Alaskan Waters to Fish

Local Fisheries Union Demands Government Intervention

San Francisco The Alaska Fisheries Union announced today that Japanese fishing boats are wantonly destroying Alaskan fishing grounds. If the U.S. government does not take measures to stop them, the union will, starting November 14, patrol all Japanese ships arriving at ports along the Pacific coast. (National Telegram, 6th)

### Japanese-Italian-German Pact Has Secret Clauses

Military and Economic Cooperation; Anti-Communism Is Just a Smokescreen

[Paris] It is rumored that the Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan has a secret protocol stipulating mutual assistance measures among the three countries. A Paris Evening News reporter in Rome asked a certain Japanese diplomat in Rome about this claim. The response was, "If a secret protocol truly exists, it is called secret. How can I tell you the content? Moreover, if Italy, Germany, and Japan have not been attacked by other countries, what is the use of such a protocol? In short, Italy, Germany, and Japan only regard the Communist International as a common enemy. They have not shown hostility towards the Moscow government. There are no restrictions on the scope of cooperation among the three countries in anti-communism, as military agreements would restrict the meaning of the pact. Wouldn't that be better?" The Paris Evening News reporter also asked a certain German diplomat about Ribbentrop's future position. The response was, "The German government will grant him an important position." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 6th)

[Paris] The Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan has recently been commented on by various newspapers, which all said that it must have secret military clauses and are deeply concerned about the interference of these countries in the internal affairs of other countries. The Radical Socialist Party's "Business Report" stated that the standing joint committee to be established by Italy, Germany, and Japan should include personnel from the general staffs of each country. "The first item on the agenda will be the issue of mutual cooperation among the fleets of each country in the event of serious international incidents. This cooperation plan should be drafted within two months. Its content will stipulate the actions that the Japanese Navy can take against the territories of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the Far East. In the future, the mutual cooperation measures of the Italian, German, and Japanese navies in the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea will also be submitted for discussion." Portugal will join the Anti-Comintern Pact imminently, and Poland also plans to legislate its participation. In addition, Japan has agreed to allow Germany and Italy to participate in imperial development matters. "All kinds of raw materials produced in the Japanese Empire that Germany needs will be exchanged for German industrial products. Japan and Germany will also organize joint ventures as soon as possible, just as Italy and Germany have done in Abyssinia. Italy will grant Japan significant commercial interests within Abyssinia as a reward." As for China, German Head of State Hitler recently told Chinese military expert General Jiang Baili that China should participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact. His intention is to isolate China and the Soviet Union. The Central Party's "Ekesi News" reported, "A certain country may be suspected of being inclined towards communism and may be interfered in its internal affairs by Italy, Germany, and Japan, even in its diplomacy, just like Spain's experience." The right-wing "Paris Echo" reported that the new organization of Italy, Germany, and Japan is aimed at the British Empire, not the Soviet Union. "Italy, Germany, and Japan have no possibility of attacking the Soviet Union, but they are superior to Britain and its territories. For example, the German Air Force can attack London, Italy's power is enough to threaten Egypt, and Japan can threaten Hong Kong and Singapore. The same is true for France." The right-wing "Figaro" reported that Japan will recognize the Spanish National Army government in the short term and support Germany's demand for the restoration of old colonies. "As for the exchange conditions, if Japan is subject to economic sanctions by various countries due to its invasion of China, Germany and Italy will speak out for it and mediate when necessary."

### Newspaper Comments

London

After the establishment of the Italian-German-Japanese Pact, the newspapers here either published it with large headlines, but did not fully comment on it. The Sunday Times reported, "Outside of the Anti-Comintern Pact, Italy, Germany, and Japan have established other understandings, especially involving the Far East War, and have promised special interests to Italy and Germany within China, or even promised special interests in Europe, to be enjoyed separately after the war ends." But in reality, after Japan's war against China, its national strength will be weakened, and its strength to jointly attack the Soviet Union with Italy and Germany will also be reduced. As for Britain, if the Italian-German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact harms its interests in the Mediterranean, Britain will definitely not ignore it. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 7th)

Paris

The right-wing "Strong" newspaper recently commented on the Italian-German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, stating that Italy's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact is based on Article 2 of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact (which stipulates that countries threatened by the Communist International should be contacted by the signatory countries so that those countries can take defensive measures or join this pact in accordance with the spirit of this pact). "In the future, Germany, Italy, and Japan can use this as an example to invite the Czech Republic to take defensive measures or join the Anti-Comintern Pact. This invitation may be issued in the form of an aide-mémoire, but it is not certain. The German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact was originally established to deal with the situation in the East. Now that Italy has joined, the original nature has been lost. It is not impossible for Germany, Italy, and Japan to interfere in the administration of European countries." The newspaper also stated that Italy will grant Japan important commercial interests in Abyssinia. The Radical Socialist Party's "Evening News" reported that the Italian-German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact has the meaning of "authoritarian policy invading the Far East." "Unexpectedly, the first week of this month ended with a situation in which peace was threatened." The Times reported that Italy's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact is the natural result of the current policies of the two major dictatorships of Germany and Italy and Japan. It also said that although the claim that Germany is mediating the dispute between China and Japan has been officially denied, the relevant parties still attach considerable importance to it. "Japanese newspapers claim that German mediation is possible, which shows that the Tokyo government may not be opposed to the mediation proposal." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 6th)

Soviet Union

The Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan has recently been commented on by Soviet political figures, who said that the aggressor countries have already reached an understanding. What they have done is only to confirm the fait accompli. From now on, the threat to Western European countries is even greater than that felt by Soviet Russia. Fortunately, the anti-Fascist forces worldwide have made progress and are more than sufficient to prevent the threat of Fascism. As for the Soviet Red Army, its strength is sufficient to cope with all events and does not need to worry. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 7th)

Berlin

After the signing of the Italian-German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, newspaper commentaries all stated that the struggle against communism has now entered a new stage. The Berlin Daily News reported, "The danger of communism in Europe has now increased compared to before, but at the same time the strength of the anti-communist front has also increased. This front is defensive in nature and has no intention of aggression. The participating countries are only bound by deciding on appropriate methods of a defensive nature to stop the harassment of the Third International and to exchange information on the activities of the Third International. That's all." The German General Review reported that among the countries in the world threatened by the disintegrating movement of Bolshevism, only the British Empire remains. "Generally speaking, since the Third International has no foothold elsewhere, it will intensify its work of destroying the British Empire." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 6th)

### German and Italian Diplomatic Talks Underway

Four Issues Are the Main Topic

There Is Talk of Replacing the German Ambassador to Britain

[Rome] Prime Minister Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, and German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop held talks this afternoon. The discussions focused on the following issues: ㊀ the operational status of the political axis between Germany and Italy, ㊁ the implementation of common policies by the two countries in Central and Eastern Europe, ㊂ the Spanish Civil War, and ㊃ Germany's request for the return of old colonies, and the reaction of the British side to this request. Observers generally believe that Germany's urging Italy to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact is mainly motivated by its request to recover old colonies. It is learned that although Ribbentrop is scheduled to return to his country tomorrow, it may not be necessary to postpone his departure. Although the German side has denied the claim that he and German Ambassador to Italy Hassel will be exchanged, it has already been decided that Hassel will be transferred to London. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 6th)

[London] According to reliable sources today, German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop may be recalled due to a dispute with British Foreign Secretary Eden. It is said that the British Foreign Office is quite opposed to Ribbentrop's various missions in Europe, such as his frequent trips to Rome for weeks at a time. Although the German side here has denied the above news, foreign diplomats generally believe it to be true. (National Telegram, 7th)

### Key to the Success or Failure of the Brussels Conference Lies with Japan

Contents of the Application to Japan Announced

[Washington] American political figures generally express doubts about what the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can achieve. They all say that since sanctions and boycott movements have been put aside, the only key to whether this conference will not be a complete failure depends on Japan's attitude. In short, if all the goals of that country can be considered to have been achieved, it may accept mediation. Otherwise, it should insist on not yielding, and other related countries will not be able to make things difficult for it. As for Germany's mediation, since Germany has signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan, it has also lost its qualifications to mediate. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 6th)

Beijing It was learned today that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference almost faced the danger of indefinite postponement yesterday. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of U.S. Chief Representative Davis alone, it was possible to pass a resolution to reopen next Tuesday and temporarily prevent the implementation of the proposal to dispatch mediation committees. It is said that Italy is very willing to participate in this committee. Davis was originally lukewarm, which caused Italian representative Macordi to leave the meeting. Davis was willing to propose that the meeting be reopened on Monday. At that time, France opposed it. Davis resolutely replied, saying that there is much work to be done in the future and it should not be a waste of time. Most of the representatives of small countries agreed with Davis's proposal, so it was finally decided to reopen on Tuesday. (National Telegram, 7th)

Beijing Our country's chief representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Dr. Gu Weijun, met with a Central News Agency reporter in the afternoon of the 6th and issued a statement saying that the draft letter from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to Japan was passed at the meeting on the morning of the 6th. The letter invited Japan to participate in the meeting in order to exchange views with several important representatives, and to discuss the possibility of improving mutual misunderstandings and stopping the war between the two sides to achieve a peaceful resolution. He stated at the meeting that he did not oppose the policies adopted by the meeting or the goodwill of the representatives to improve the situation, but he retained the position that China expressed on the opening day of the Nine-Power Conference, that is, if mediation is to be adopted, it must be based on the obligation to implement the Nine-Power Treaty. He also requested that the draft letter inviting Japan to participate in the meeting must be fair and impartial, and that the content should include not only Japan's complaints, but also China's accusations against Japan. The representatives considered his suggestions to be fair and expressed their agreement. The draft letter was announced on the evening of the 6th. (Central News Agency, 7th)

### Full Text of the Reply from Belgium to Japan

The request from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing, sent to Japan, has recently been voted on and passed by the plenary session and has been sent out. The full text is typed on four pages, divided into six paragraphs. It states that in its reply on the 27th of last month to Belgium's note, the Japanese government stated: ㊀ it has no territorial ambitions in China; ㊁ its actions in China do not violate the Nine-Power Treaty; ㊂ it has many grievances with China, all of which the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has noted. At the same time, the Chinese government also submitted a note stating that Japan had violated the Nine-Power Treaty, refuted Japan's accusations, and listed its grievances against Japan. "The Nine-Power Treaty contains provisions applicable to this situation. The discussions currently underway in Beijing are based primarily on these provisions, namely the method of full and frank communication among the contracting parties as stipulated in Article VII of the treaty. The purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to peacefully resolve disputes between the contracting parties. One party to the dispute, China, has already sent representatives to attend and is prepared to fully participate in the work of the conference. It is hoped that the other party will also come and cooperate. It is regrettable that Japan has not been able to attend." Japan's note also stated that holding a conference by a majority of countries to find a solution would only complicate the current situation further. Regarding this, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference believes that all contracting parties are qualified to exercise the rights contained in the treaty. All countries with interests in the Far East have been affected by the Sino-Japanese war, and the potential consequences of this war for international peace have been noted by countries around the world. Therefore, convening a conference to discuss the matter is appropriate. "Although the representatives of the participating countries believe that there is room for redress regarding the concerns expressed by the Japanese government, it remains to be seen whether the Japanese government is prepared to send one or more representatives to exchange views within the framework of the treaty with representatives of certain countries designated by the conference. The objective of this exchange of views is to clarify certain points declared by both parties to the dispute and thereby find a solution. Please provide a prompt response as to whether the Japanese government can accept the above arrangements." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 6th)

### Britain Willing to Help with Post-War Reconstruction in China

International Nature as Principle, British Under-Secretary Answers Questions from Members of Parliament

[London] During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Mr. Smith raised the issue of assisting China in recovering after the end of the current Sino-Japanese war. Mr. Smith asked whether, if China needed financial assistance to recover after the end of the war, British influence would be used to ensure that such assistance was of an international nature and not to the benefit of any one country. Under-Secretary Lord Cranborne replied that the British government would continue to focus its efforts on ensuring that such assistance to China was not an issue of international competition, but a matter to be discussed, with China of course included.

### Enemy Troops Landing at Jinshanwei Have Been Defeated and Retreating by Our Ambush

Our Forces' Positions in Pudong Remain Solid, Bitter Battle at Baziqiao Yesterday, Lost and Regained

This newspaper received a front-line war report at 2:00 AM this morning stating: ㊀ After continuous reinforcements, the enemy landing at Jinshanwei reached nearly a brigade in strength. Yesterday morning, they attempted to advance from Zhalin, Songyin, Mishidu, and other locations to attack Fengxian, Minhang, Songjiang, and other strongholds in an attempt to cut off the rear of our Songhu forces. After our side dispatched elite troops to rigorously block them, the enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated south. Fierce battles are currently underway in the Songyin, Zhangyan, Tinglin area of Punan. ㊁ From 10:00 AM yesterday, enemy artillery units north of the Suzhou River heavily bombarded our positions in Chengeng and Beigongjiazhai, firing over 3,000 rounds. At around 5:00 PM, the enemy at Liujiazhai, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on the Beigongjiazhai position. Our side also used artillery to cover infantry charges, fighting a bloody battle until 10:00 PM, killing over 300 enemy soldiers. The enemy then retreated without support. ㊂ Yesterday afternoon, at 1:30 PM, enemy troops north of the river crossed the river from Houjiadai as reinforcements, but were repelled by our forces, killing over 80 enemy soldiers. However, the enemy at Wujia Ku launched a fierce flanking attack, and our troops at Zhangjiangdu and Qujiaqiao made a slight rearward adjustment. ㊃ Yesterday afternoon, at around 1:00 PM, the enemy at Gejiaxiang launched a fierce attack on our Chichuan position, but were bravely repelled by our forces. ㊄ Last night, at around 8:00 PM, our □□ regiment in the Jiangqiao town area, acting on orders, launched a successful attack towards the Xibang area and are currently in stalemate outside the Zhaiqiao Zhai.

### Enemy Landing in Hangzhou Bay Blocked by Our Forces

Enemy Also Blocked Outside Xincang

According to military news, the enemy forces landed between Zhalin and Zhapu along the coast of Zhejiang Province and advanced north, but have been blocked by our forces. Fierce battles have occurred approximately four to five kilometers north of the Hangzhou-Shanghai Highway, and the situation there is stabilizing. According to reliable reports, the enemy landed in three locations successively on the 4th and 5th: approximately 300 troops at Caojing Town, and approximately 1,000 troops each at Jinshanwei and Quan Gongting. At that time, 500 troops advanced beyond the highway from Quan Gongting, but were blocked by our forces outside Xincang Town, approximately four kilometers to the north. A small number of enemy outposts advanced further north from Caojing, but were all repelled by our forces.

### Enemy Retreating South from Mishidu

A military correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 12:45 PM on the 7th that the enemy forces landed in the Jinshanzui area, hoping to cut off the rear of our troops in the Pudong area. Therefore, after landing, they scurried northward. It is learned that a small number of enemy troops advanced to Mishidu on the south bank of the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, but after being attacked by our forces, they were forced to retreat south.

Further report, the enemy who landed at Jinshanwei in Punan are now advancing on two routes with the Yangtze River as their target. One route, from Caojing Town and Jinshanzui southeast of Jinshanwei, captured the towns of Tinglin and Yexie and went straight to Songjiang. The other route goes from Jin Siniang Bridge, Quan Gongting, along Songfeng Road, and Songyin Zhangyan straight to Mishidu, but all were blocked by the natural barrier of the Huangpu River. Our army is currently dividing its forces to encircle and suppress the enemy, strictly guarding Zhalin and Zhapu, cutting off the enemy's retreat, and launching a pincer attack from Pudong and Zhujing. Yesterday morning, the enemy's advance troops once attempted to attack Mishidu, but were severely attacked by our army in the vicinity and defeated to the south. Our army took advantage of the victory and advanced straight forward, and fierce fighting is still in progress.

### Pudong Positions Increasingly Consolidated

After the enemy forces landed in the Jinshanzui area, Pudong appeared to be threatened due to the terrain, so there was a brief disturbance yesterday morning, and residents fled to Puxi. In fact, our military authorities have built strong fortifications at all important points along the Pudong coast, and it is impossible for enemy soldiers to land even a step. The enemy forces advancing to the upper reaches of the Huangpu River have also been blocked by our main force and cannot flee north, so there is nothing to worry about. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, we dispatched a large number of elite troops to reinforce the Pudong border, so the Pudong positions are now more consolidated than before.

### Enemy Troops Encircled at Liujiazhai Attempt to Attack Chenggen Without Success

Attack Beigongjiazhai Again in the Evening, Over 300 Enemy Killed

The enemy at Liujiazhai launched a continuous attack on our Chenggen position from morning to night yesterday. At the same time, the enemy troops north of the Suzhou River bombarded fiercely with artillery to cover the infantry's sneak attack, firing a total of over 3,000 shells. Our army vowed to resist and persisted with the enemy. Although the fortifications were slightly damaged, morale was not diminished. As a result, the enemy made no progress and retreated to the Liujiazhai position. At 5:30 PM, the enemy launched another fierce attack on Beigongjiazhai, and a bloody battle broke out with our army. Our army, under heavy artillery fire, disregarded life and death and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. By 10:00 PM, the enemy had been killed over 300 men, were wounded and retreated.

### Our Troops Shoot Down Enemy Balloon, Setting It on Fire

Boasting of a Million Japanese Soldiers, One Shot Brings It Down in a Cloud of Smoke

The Zi Lin Daily reported that at 3:00 PM on Saturday afternoon, the Japanese army launched a balloon over the Suzhou River in the Xujiahui area, with a long banner attached that read "Million Japanese Soldiers Have Landed North of Hangzhou Bay" in large Chinese characters. So, the Chinese soldiers used it as a target, and in less than half an hour, the balloon was hit and set on fire, falling to the ground. On Saturday afternoon, a thick smoke shrouded the western battlefield, which was obviously not smoke screens launched from the sky by aircraft, but was caused by burning a substance on the ground. It could not be accurately determined whether it was caused by the Chinese or Japanese side, east of the railway.

### Fierce Fighting at Zhu Jia Bang Continues

Enemy Breaks Through Zhangjiang Du Qujia Qiao, Repelled by Our Brave Counterattack at Baziqiao

A Central News Agency correspondent reported from the field at 12:00 AM on the 7th that the enemy's fierce attacks on the Zhu Jia Bang line were unsuccessful. Today (the 7th) morning, they used heavy artillery to bombard our positions, especially concentrating on Baziqiao and Qujiaqiao, as the enemy's goal was to develop along the riverbank and attempt to join forces with the enemy forces in the Liujiazhai area and advance south. Our troops originally defended the Zhu Jia Bang line, but this morning the point of Zhangjiang Du was broken through by the enemy, and by 5:00 PM Qujia Qiao had also fallen, making the point of Baziqiao too prominent and under considerable threat. Therefore, the situation was very urgent for a time, but at around 9:00 PM in the evening, our reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack, repelling the enemy, and the battle became more intense. It was also learned that the battle situation on that line yesterday was also very fierce. Our Battalion Commander Chen Yulian led his soldiers in bravely killing the enemy when he was unfortunately shot and killed, sacrificing himself for the country, but the entire army was even more inspired by this and repelled the enemy.

A Central News Agency correspondent reported from the field at 12:45 PM on the 7th that our elite troops were fighting back on the Yaojiazhai Wujia Ku line in the western section of the Suzhou River, and the situation had turned around. Although the enemy had continuously attacked our Zhu Jia Bang, Xupu, and other key points on the entire line in the past twelve hours, they had all been repelled by our forces. Baziqiao is our main stronghold, and the enemy is making every effort to attack it. Although our position wavered once last afternoon and night, we reinforced the counterattack and finally drove the enemy back. In addition, Zhangjiang Du, which controls the intersection of Zhujiabang and the Suzhou River, is also very important. We originally guarded the north of the bank, but we were threatened by the enemy, so we retreated to the south of the bank and confronted the enemy across Zhujiabang. The enemy used twenty-year-old field guns to bombard our entire line this morning because they had repeatedly failed to attack. The sound of the artillery was deafening, and it had not stopped at the time of reporting, with nearly a thousand shells fired.

### Enemy at Tao Bang Completely Annihilated

A Central News Agency correspondent reported from the field at 12:45 PM on the 7th that before dawn today, the enemy, under the cover of a smokescreen, landed at the east and west Tao Bang at the intersection of the Suzhou River on the south bank and Pias Road. However, the number of people was not large. After being discovered by our army, they were surrounded and suppressed, and all were annihilated.

### Our Army Recaptured Original Position on Chichuan Line

A Central News Agency correspondent reported from the field at 12:45 PM on the 7th that the enemy troops in the Liujiazhai area on the south bank of the Suzhou River launched a fierce attack on our Xuejia Ku Chichuan line.

At around 4:00 PM, a small enemy military boat carrying a dozen soldiers, with machine guns mounted and shielded by steel plates, sailed to the Yulong Wharf in Lujiazui and outside the Rihua Yarn Factory to reconnoiter. They then lingered at the stern of a British ship and used binoculars to look at the shore, but never dared to approach Pudong. After half an hour, they sailed downstream. Da Gong News reported that, according to people from Puxidong, the number of enemy ships in the Huangpu River suddenly increased this morning.

### Pudong Residents Cross the River in the Rain Yesterday

Currently Being Resettled by Clansmen Associations

Central News Agency reported that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the enemy has repeatedly attempted to land in Pudong, but has been repelled by our forces. Yesterday, because enemy forces landed on the north bank of Hangzhou Bay, rumors spread in the city, and Pudong residents flocked to cross to Puxi in small boats in the rain. From 10:00 PM the night before last to 6:00 PM last night, the wharves south of Chunjiang Wharf were jammed with refugees. In total, more than 20,000 refugees crossed to Puxi, accounting for a portion of the Pudong population. They have all been taken in by the Pudong Clansmen Association and various refugee shelters. Yesterday happened to be a day of continuous autumn rain, and the refugees were all wet and in a miserable state. Moreover, because there were many people and few boats, many people lost their footing and fell into the water in order to be the first to board the boats. At around 12:00 PM yesterday, a ferry carrying more than 30 refugees capsized when it sailed to the Huangpu River near the Taikoo Wharf due to overcrowding. Although foreign ships nearby sent lifeboats to rescue them, some were not rescued in time and drowned, which was truly unbearable to witness.

At around 1:00 PM yesterday, just as Pudong residents were moving to Puxi, a rowing boat, due to overcrowding, suddenly capsized and sank in the waters south of an Italian warship, throwing more than a dozen male and female passengers into the water at the same time. Two small motorboats were quickly dispatched from the nearby American and French warships to rescue eleven or twelve people, but two or three people tragically drowned and disappeared.

Another report, since the Pudong area has been ravaged and bombed by enemy aircraft, in addition to residents with slightly better living conditions who have moved to safe areas, there are still many poor residents who are trapped by their wealth or inconvenient to move. For some reason, they suddenly became flustered before dawn yesterday and fled westward in the pouring rain. By the morning, thousands of refugees had crossed the river in the rain and sought refuge in the concessions. The Pudong Clansmen Association had no less than a thousand people entering their doors in one day, and they all contacted the association and the relief association, and used several trucks to transport them to the shelters separately. Those who could not be sent were temporarily staying at the association, so that they could continue to be resettled today.

### Stray Bullets Fly in Western Shanghai

Residents of Various Villages Fleeing Everywhere, Caojing Town Trying to Rescue Women and Children

Since our side retreated to the new position, the enemy army has repeatedly crossed the river and attacked, but all have been repelled by our army, and they have been unable to succeed in the end. Therefore, from the evening of the previous day (6th) and yesterday (7th), they concentrated artillery fire in the Beixin Canal and Zhoujiaqiao area, hoping to cover their troops to cross the river. Therefore, the sound of guns and cannons was as dense as a string of pearls, causing stray bullets to fly everywhere. A field artillery shell fell on Wangjia Xuan in Xinlonghua, setting fire to and destroying the ship and five houses near the market, injuring one farmer and killing one woman and one boy. A shell fell near Caohe Temple, a small steel cannon shell fell on Fantou west of the Meilong East section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, killing a 13-year-old boy and collapsing two houses. Stray bullets flew into the vicinity of the Caohejing West Town Jiangjia Tomb Mountain North and the south bank of the Yangjia Bridge, causing panic among the residents of various villages, who fled to safe places in cars, with old and young, carrying burdens on their shoulders, crowded on the way, the scene was miserable and unbearable to witness.

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, Yang Xinzheng, a municipal committee member of the Caojing District in western Shanghai, and Luo Yinong, head of the defense regiment, have supervised the police and regiment to protect the area, sparing no effort. Due to strategic considerations, our army moved the position westward, no more than about 10 li from the town, causing it to be affected by stray bullets from time to time. In order to stabilize local order, they began on the 6th to first have Yang Jishi, Chen Xueyu and directors of the relief group escort the women, children, elderly and weak throughout the town to the Huimeng Primary School outside the Xinbei Gate of Shanghai for shelter, while urging all shops to operate as usual in order to maintain the market.

### British Consul-General to Xiamen, Marting, Completes Term and Returns Home

Various Circles in Xiamen Hold Farewell Ceremony

Xiamen Dispatch: British Consul-General to Xiamen, Mr. Marting, completed his term at the end of last month and returned home. Various circles in Xiamen, appreciating Mr. Marting's harmonious relationship during his four years in office, held a grand farewell ceremony and specially made a large red satin canopy in the ancient Chinese style, embroidered with the four characters "Promoting Friendship", to present to Mr. Marting as a memento. Before leaving, Mr. Marting expressed his feelings and impressions of his four years in Xiamen, saying, "As the Consul-General to Xiamen, I have spent four years in a flash. Recalling these four years, I am very happy to have been treated with sincerity by the Chinese people. The progress of Xiamen's undertakings in recent years has been remarkable. When I first arrived in Xiamen, gambling was rampant and caused the most harm. There were almost shootings every week. To eliminate this bad habit, cooperation between Chinese and foreign authorities was necessary. Most of those who opened gambling dens were overseas Chinese holding foreign nationality. After the sharp crackdown by the first mayor, Wang Gu Pan, the scourge of gambling was eradicated in less than a year. In terms of construction, there has been considerable achievement. The seawall reclamation project was completed four years ago, and most of the roads have been completed. The Xiamen-Gulangyu ferry has also been opened. Xiamen is the only port in southern Fujian, and ships of 10,000 tons can enter. The planned construction of the new wharf will make it a modern commercial port. In addition, with the realization of the Gaoqi-Jimei Bridge, its future as a major commercial center in China is immeasurable. Recently, due to the serious situation, commerce has stagnated and people's hearts are uneasy. Fortunately, the new mayor, Mr. Gao Han'ao, has shouldered the difficulties and gained the trust of the Chinese and foreign people of Xiamen and the reliance of the military authorities. This has gradually restored the sluggish market, and residents who had fled are returning to Xiamen in droves. I believe that under the leadership of Mayor Gao, with unity from top to bottom, the prosperity of Xiamen can be predicted."

### British Authorities Consider Shipping Safety

North Waterway of Great Keelung Safe; Changes to Be Notified Immediately

The North-China Daily News reports that British shipping companies were notified yesterday by the British authorities that the issue of transport safety had been further considered by Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China. The Admiral's view is that since British ships and cargo ships sailing from above Great Keelung to the Public Concession or the French Concession's Pudong have never been hit by shells or bombs, navigation on this route is not significantly more dangerous than berthing near Great Keelung or in neutral waters. The authorities' views on navigation safety may need to be changed in the future, but if there are any changes, all shipping companies will be notified immediately.

### Diary of a War Correspondent (10)

— By Chen Wanli, Special War Correspondent for the Central News Agency

In the last ten days of October, I experienced a few days of fresh and stimulating life. This has left a valuable page in my life history. Now, after completing my mission, I have completely escaped from danger, and recalling the past scenes feels very enjoyable. Here I will write down everything from the past as a supplement to my "Diary of a War Correspondent." Because in the past few days, I was initially completely under the control of enemy aircraft, and even the purpose of writing a diary was deprived. Later, I was busy with various fragmented matters after the transfer, coupled with a restless mood. The "Diary of a War Correspondent" was therefore interrupted. I am very sorry for this.

㊀ Before the Retreat

In this war of resistance, our sky was almost completely controlled by enemy aircraft. This is an undeniable fact. We had to wait until "the sun set in the west" before we could start our activities, whether it was building fortifications or mobilizing troops. Even artillery fire was no exception. Therefore, the enemy had twenty-four hours of activity time every day, while we only had twelve hours. As for the enemy's firepower being more powerful than ours and the enemy's mechanized troops being several times larger than ours, these are all facts that everyone knows. Under these circumstances, with the united strength of the whole country, under the leadership of the supreme leader, and with loyal and courageous soldiers fighting the enemy with their flesh and blood, we retreated from the first line of defense to the second line of defense only after two months and eighteen days. This is glorious for us. This is a victory for us. Because in our original plan, we planned to fight a bloody battle with the enemy for two months and then retreat to the second line of defense. Now, we have exceeded the scheduled time limit by eighteen days and inflicted significant damage on the enemy before retreating in an orderly manner to the first line of defense. Is this not the supreme glory? Is this not a great victory? But the regret is that we could have defended the first line for quite a long time if there had been no accidents, although this is truly asking too much of us.

The enemy's attack on the south bank of the Wenzaobang began after the retreat from the Liuhang area. Recently, the enemy on the south bank of the Wenzaobang (west of the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway) launched a fierce attack on our Zoumatang line on October 23. On the morning of the 24th, the old Ren Bridge in the center of Zoumatang was broken through by the enemy. A certain commander stationed in Zoumatang reported to Commander-in-Chief × by telephone. The Commander-in-Chief ordered him to defend the position to the death and not to retreat without orders. However, after a short period of fierce fighting, they finally retreated. The speed of this retreat was truly an accident. On the evening of the 24th, our troops stationed on the south bank of the Wenzaobang (east of the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway) were ordered to move to the west of the highway to block the enemy, holding the line parallel to Datang. At the same time, on the east of the highway, the main position was the Changzhong Road, with a warning line slightly south of Miaohang. The troops along the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway also retreated to the Yaocuntang area to protect Datang. On this line of defense, we had quite strong fortifications, and we were prepared to inflict even greater blows on the enemy on this position. However, this was also unexpected. On the morning of the 20th, the Yaocuntang area was resolutely broken through by the enemy, causing them to infiltrate the left flank of the Datang position and shaking the entire line.

Although the Datang line was breached, our loyal and courageous soldiers continued to fight a bloody battle with the enemy for more than twenty-four hours. The intensity of the battle was truly "unprecedented." On the evening of the 26th, we used a small number of troops to hold the three points of Zhabei Pengpu and Zhenru, blocking the enemy's advance. At the same time, the remaining troops calmly retreated to the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, preserving their original strength. On the 27th and 28th, the troops stationed in Zhenru and Pengpu also retreated one after another. The brave soldiers who defended Zhabei to the death only withdrew from Zhabei at midnight on the 30th, shedding tears and obeying the orders of the Supreme Commander. From the start of the August 13th Shanghai Battle until now, we have fought bitterly with the enemy for two months and eighteen days, using fresh red blood to dye the most glorious page in national history.

㊁ Life Under Enemy Aircraft Control

From the 23rd onwards, there were always more than a hundred enemy aircraft over the Datang Zhenru and Beixinjing areas, bombing and strafing everywhere, without a moment's respite all day long. Even at night, the enemy troops continued to be active, with flares fired in the air, lighting up the night as if it were daytime. The purpose of the enemy aircraft's activities was, on the one hand, to try to eliminate our forces and, on the other hand, to try to stop our reinforcements.

A small village near Zhenru was the location of the headquarters of the ××th Army, which was also where I was staying. Thirty-four hours a day, it was almost completely under the control of enemy aircraft. Our two meals a day were at five o'clock in the morning and six o'clock in the evening, because this was the only time we had to be liberated. However, sometimes it was impossible to get even these two meals. We ate only one meal a day. The extent to which we were controlled by enemy aircraft can be clearly seen here.

I was completely under the control of enemy aircraft, and I lost my freedom of personal action, whether it was day or night. Bombs exploded around me, and machine guns strafed overhead. I spent almost the entire day hiding in the bomb shelter, feeling the threat of the iron birds at every moment. There was nothing I could do but "fold my arms and rise up," which was truly painful to the extreme. But seeing that everyone from the Commander-in-Chief down was still busy commanding operations and handling military affairs as usual, this moved me to the point of almost shedding tears. What I personally feared most was the strafing from aerial machine guns, because the machine gun bullets were dense, and the range was long. In addition, the firing line was diagonal, making it impossible to defend against. Besides this, I had a special reason for fearing aerial machine gun strafing, which was that on the morning of the 24th, right in front of my residence, a peasant woman was strafed by enemy aircraft. I witnessed the fresh red blood flowing from the honeycomb-like wounds. Thinking of this tragic scene now still makes me shudder. Secondly, what I disliked was the seemingly clumsy bombing aircraft. It could drop bombs in a grand manner, without even bending down. This was the so-called horizontal bombing. It was silent and casual, and it also made people feel a sense of being caught off guard. As for light bombers, I didn't care about them at all later.

Completely under the control of enemy aircraft, I spent four whole days. The eight characters "uneasy in sleep and food" and "days like years" can be said to have fully described life under enemy aircraft control. During the day, even eating was not free, and at night, even sleep was not peaceful. I spent almost the entire day living in the basement. Sometimes, I ran out of the basement, only wanting to get a chance to stretch my back and rest, but I would immediately hear the buzzing of heavy bombers flying overhead. Either there were dense machine guns strafing in the air, or heavy bombs were exploding nearby, immediately driving you back into the basement. It was truly "uneasy in sleep and food," and it was truly "days like years." But now, looking back, this kind of life was quite fresh and stimulating. (To be continued)

### A Record of a Week of Fierce Fighting on the Suzhou Creek

— Shan

Since our forces, due to strategic considerations, voluntarily shifted the right flank and central route to the Suzhou Creek, this once-quiet river has instantly become a military stronghold, the very first line of defense in our Shanghai-Songhu resistance. Because of its importance and the convenient transportation around its basin, it has become even more of a military center.

There, we have built very solid fortifications and equipped them with a strong military force. If the enemy dares to try, we are sure to give them a severe blow and a crushing defeat, perhaps even annihilation. This has been proven by many past events. Although we have also made considerable sacrifices in the past, sacrificing ourselves for the country, in order to fight for the survival of the nation and to eliminate the only enemy of the Chinese nation – Japan, no matter how many warriors we sacrifice, how much innocent people's blood is shed, how much of our construction and everything else is destroyed, it is worth it, we are willing, it is great and magnificent!

On the morning of October 31st, thirty or forty enemy soldiers, while the morning mist had not yet dissipated, began to move on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, carrying out their first attempt to cross the river stealthily, and as usual, under a barrage of artillery fire, they released smoke screens and attacked our Zhoujia Bridge. At that time, our defending soldiers of the ×th Division, who were hiding on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, were waiting in strict formation. Watching this group of enemies set up canvas bridges and crawl on their knees, they could not help but smile silently at each other. But when the enemy approached, there would be no forgiveness. They immediately used the pre-arranged fire network to densely strafe the approaching enemy. Therefore, in less than an hour, this group of enemies had been completely annihilated by us and buried at the bottom of the river, and the canvas bridge became our trophy. On this day, the enemy never dared to invade again.

At midnight on the 31st, which was the morning of November 1st, at two or three o'clock, presumably the enemy soldiers had deeply felt that our Zhoujia Bridge fortress was heavily guarded and its tiger-like power was difficult to overcome. Therefore, they changed their plan and sent six or seven hundred soldiers, under the cover of smoke screens, from Chenjiadu, Majiazai, Panjiagang, Houjiadai, and Huajia Bridge to make a second stealthy crossing and attack our positions in Liujiazai, Beixinjing, Qiaojia Bridge, Wujiaku, and Tingtou. At that time, our soldiers immediately divided their forces to intercept them. Our mortars, flat-trajectory guns, light and heavy weapons, and hand grenades fell on the enemy like dense raindrops. Although the enemy tried their best to resist and massively reinforce, after several hours of our fierce bombardment, the enemy finally could not hold out and was completely repelled by us from Chenjiadu, Majiazai, Huangjiazhai, and Panjiagang. At the same time, because several of the enemy's only river-crossing tools, the canvas bridges, had been destroyed by our shells, a significant number of enemy soldiers fell into the river and drowned. Their corpses along the riverbank were not even dragged back; later, our brave soldiers buried them. In this battle, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and losses, and also sent our soldiers many gifts. Therefore, they soon used much-needed artillery fire to bombard us directly, as if to vent their anger. But our position was still solid and intact. At four o'clock that evening, which was the morning of the 2nd, the enemy forces once again stirred in the above-mentioned places, but in the end, they were still driven back by our loyal and brave soldiers. Afterwards, there were some contacts, but these were skirmishes. Our artillery fire never stopped for a day, and many shells hit the enemy's important strongholds. But unfortunately, our regimental commander died heroically from serious injuries while personally directing the front line that day. This is our loss! But the regimental commander was honorable and heroic. At the same time, it is said that two other regimental commanders were also seriously injured and are now being treated. I am very sincerely praying for them here, hoping that they will recover soon and continue to kill the enemy!

On the evening of the 2nd and at dawn on the 3rd, the enemy soldiers abandoned their previous plan and suddenly shifted their troops westward, making another stealthy crossing at the intersection of Houjiadai, Huajia Bridge, and the east bank of Shenjijiabang on the Suzhou Creek, attacking our Yaojiazhai, Tingtou, and Wujiaku. It is estimated that their force was about 2,000. At the same time, on the Liujiazai side, across the river from Chenjiadu, 300 to 400 men also forcibly landed. At that time, our defending forces in the above-mentioned places, seeing the rampant enemy forces, immediately dispatched troops from Wujiaku, Tingtou, and Yaojiazhai on three sides to surround the enemy and gradually suppress them. Our troops in Liujiazai also rose up to engage the enemy soldiers from Chenjiadu. At that time, the artillery fire in both places shook the entire Shanghai, with shells falling like rain and flesh and blood flying everywhere. Enemy planes even assisted in the battle in the sky. Under that arduous struggle, our army still managed to annihilate many enemies. After eight or nine hours of fierce fighting, the enemy forces on the Liujiazai side were first resolved by the Northern Army. More than a hundred enemy soldiers, because their retreat was blocked, fled into nearby Western-style houses and factories, where they were of course still surrounded by us. However, some of the enemy soldiers were very clever and immediately knelt down and surrendered, but there were also thirty or forty who stubbornly resisted, and they were gradually eliminated. The enemy forces in Wujiaku and Tingtou, because of the unremitting siege by our troops in Yaojiazhai, Zhangzhai, and Caizhai, had lost almost all of their advance troops and began to flee in panic. However, the enemy's rear route had not been cut off, so they were reinforced by more than 700 men that afternoon and attacked again, building fortifications there and densely covering them with barbed wire, as if they intended to use it as a base. Our army preemptively took action. Immediately, they used fierce and concentrated artillery fire to bombard the enemy's position. The enemy stubbornly resisted with their backs to the river, and a fierce battle broke out at eight o'clock that evening. However, our army was determined to die, advancing wave after wave, and persevering. By about ten o'clock in the afternoon, our troops on the right flank had recaptured the eastern half of Wujiaku, and soon the western part of Tingtou was also recovered by our troops on the left flank. However, there was still a portion of the enemy that had not been eliminated.

On the morning of the 4th, just as our army was advancing north to search for the remaining enemies, unexpectedly, a large number of enemy reinforcements were also crossing the river at that time, estimated to be about 3,000. At that time, the soldiers of our two battalions, although they had encountered difficulties, still bravely charged into the enemy's position, killing and wiping out the enemy as if they were in an uninhabited area. The enemy's formation was completely broken through by our army, so both sides entered a retreat. All artillery fire completely lost its effectiveness, and it was all a battle of bayonets and flesh and blood, the intensity of the fighting was unprecedented. Soon, our rear reinforcements joined the battle and surrounded all the enemy forces on three sides, attacking and suppressing them fiercely. Seeing the precarious situation, the enemy forces also urgently requested reinforcements, rushing back and forth between Yaojiazhai and Caizhai, trying to break through. Our artillery fire closely bombarded the places where the enemy soldiers were entrenched, fighting until the evening of the 4th. A small part of the enemy forces broke through the encirclement and fled to Tianduzhai and Yujidun, but after being ambushed by our army, they still scurried back to Wujiaku and Tingtou. At midnight on the 4th and early morning on the 5th, our army and reinforcements launched a counter-offensive, relying on our superior street fighting tactics to gradually drive the enemy away. By six o'clock in the morning on the 5th, the enemies in Yaojiazhai, Zhangzhai, and Caizhai had been completely eliminated by us. However, Wujiaku and Tingtou were still in the hands of the enemy, and they were still adding fortifications and stubbornly resisting. In this battle, both sides suffered heavy losses. Our army captured one enemy anti-aircraft machine gun, three light machine guns, more than twenty Type 38 rifles, more than a dozen gas masks, and countless bullets and hand grenades. These many trophies have been transported to the rear and stored. I think that when we celebrate National Day next year, we can use these many enemy gifts to build several commemorative arches to commemorate our soldiers who fought in the resistance.

At four o'clock on the morning of the 5th, the enemies in Wujiaku and Tingtou again sent heavy troops to attack our positions in Yaojiazhai, Zhangzhai, and Caizhai. Their artillery fire never stopped for even a second, so our fortifications suffered some damage and were broken through by them. At that time, our soldiers guarding Baziqiao, Tianduzhai, and Jiangjiazhai immediately advanced forward, cutting off the enemy soldiers in Caizhai, Yaojiazhai, Zhangzhai, and Nuedunqiu into several sections, surrounding and killing them individually, thus forming a mixed battle situation again. The battle continued until that afternoon, and our position had not changed. Moreover, on the south bank of Zhujia Creek, a strong military force was reinforced to prevent the spread of enemy forces. This time, the enemy's losses and deaths were probably two or three times higher than ours, but their heavy weapons still could not be transported across the Suzhou Creek.

At the same time, the enemy forces in Chenjiadu, at eight or nine o'clock that morning, took advantage of the natural smoke screen, rain, and fog to stealthily cross the river to reinforce Liujiazai, and while building fortifications, they scurried towards Chi Circle and Xuejiaku. Our reinforcements arrived on time, and both sides launched a bloody battle in this area. Our communication was once disrupted, but it was soon restored. By dusk, it was raining heavily, and our loyal and brave soldiers risked the rain to fight desperately, getting their clothes completely soaked. In the end, they drove the enemy out and maintained the original front line. At two o'clock on the morning of the 6th, the enemy reinforced and attacked again. Their purpose, of course, was still to seize our positions in Beigongzhai and Chi Circle, but they had already encountered our sharp resistance. I am afraid that they would still be working in vain, simply increasing a few units on their list of deaths.

### Refugee Camp in Nanshi Expected to be Established Today

The Public Security of Nanshi is Still Maintained by Our Police Security Corps. The People of Nanshi are Reassured and the Shops are Open as Usual.

The specific measures for the refugee camp in Nanshi, which is being carried out by people from various countries, have been finalized, and it is expected that it will be signed and established today. People from all walks of life are paying close attention to this. From now on, the public security there will still be maintained by our country's police and security corps. As for the armed forces, there are no garrisons in Nanshi, so there is no so-called withdrawal. After hearing the news that the refugee camp will be established, some residents have moved back from the concession. Although the enemy authorities once threatened to bomb Nanshi on a large scale, due to the opposition of people from various countries and the establishment of the refugee camp, although enemy planes occasionally go to reconnaissance, there have been no bombing raids. Therefore, the people of Nanshi are very reassured, and order is gradually being restored. Most of the shops in the Fangbang Road area have resumed business as usual.

The *North China Daily News* reports that the non-combatant safety zone in Nanshi, which was established by the International Red Cross Refugee Relief Committee, has been approved by both the Chinese and Japanese authorities, and is now being arranged in a state that satisfies all parties concerned. The committee is chaired by Father Jacquinot. After a meeting yesterday, it announced that it hoped to arrange everything properly within two days. The Nanshi Police Department is still responsible for maintaining public security in the area, and the committee will send personnel to monitor the implementation of the plan approved by both China and Japan and report to the committee every day. This plan is the responsibility of four foreign committee members, all of whom are expatriates from the International Settlement and the French Concession.

### The First Batch of Overseas Chinese War Service Corps Returns to China

Mechanical Automobile Experts and Technicians. The Second and Third Batches will Return to China in Two Weeks.

Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, the government has been in great need of various specialized talents, and overseas Chinese have returned to their motherland to participate in front-line service. The Philippine Chinese have been very concerned about their motherland. Since hearing that the government had recruited specialized personnel from various places to return to China and participate in the war of resistance, they immediately formed the "Overseas Chinese Returning to the Country Service Corps." Among the overseas Chinese living in the Philippines, more than forty specialized personnel and technicians have signed up to participate, and they have all reported to the consulate to complete all the procedures for returning to the country. They are scheduled to depart in three batches. The first batch is mechanical automobile experts and technicians, including Lu Tiesheng, Wang Ruoding, Deng Qingting, Li Zuze, Zhang Changjian, Cai Pei, Shi Xingxiu, Ding Jindin, Weng Wenhua, Zhang Yiguo, and 15 others, have returned to China on the Dutch ship Zisaga Nuo. Today, they can transfer to the capital, report to the central government, and wait for the military authorities to assign them to serve on various front lines. According to the overseas Chinese who have arrived, the second and third batches will be equipped with various experts and can return to China in two weeks. It is also said that since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance in our country, overseas Chinese everywhere have heard of it and are united against the enemy. Overseas Chinese merchants have long been saving money and raising funds for the long-term war of resistance. If the government orders overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in the war, then overseas Chinese will be happy to serve their motherland.

### Rescuing Under the Rain

The Red Swastika Society rescue team, in the drizzling rain last night, teams one and two and the entire stretcher team set out, rushing to the front line in various directions, rescuing under the rain in ×× and other places, rescuing a total of eighty-four wounded soldiers, and one injured civilian woman, and sending them to various hospitals of the society for treatment.

The Shanghai City Defense Corps Rescue Team's rescue work has mostly focused on the rear in the past. Recently, it has changed its plan and decided to go to the front line for rescue every day. Yesterday, the entire team of more than 3,000 people, led by team leader Xu Fenghan, set out to the Chenjia Bridge Zhoujia Bridge area of the front line, venturing deep into the position to work under the rain. The team members are all in the spirit of service. Although the enemy's shells continue to fall nearby, they remain unmoved and are still busy with rescue work. From 6:00 p.m. that afternoon to 4:00 a.m. the next morning, a total of more than eighty wounded soldiers were rescued and sent to Zhongshan Hospital by the team's ambulance.

The Sichuan Fellow Association Anti-Enemy Support Association, since resuming the rescue of wounded soldiers on the front line, its efforts to serve are commendable, and the achievements of its work are also clear to everyone. In order to promote the work, three trucks are specially dispatched every day, rain or shine, to the front. However, all the team members are now suffering from illness due to overwork, but they are still in good spirits and continue to work as usual to fulfill their duties.

### Lin Kanghou Raises Funds to Relieve Refugees

A Total of 10,500 Yuan

Lin Kanghou, chairman of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, deeply felt the lack of winter clothing for the tens of thousands of refugees in Shanghai as the weather became colder and the number of sick people increased. Therefore, he raised 4,000 yuan from the Continental Bank, 4,000 yuan from the Siming Bank, 2,000 yuan from the Farmer-Worker Bank, and 500 yuan from the Tonghe Bank, totaling 10,500 yuan, and delivered all of them to the Charity Relief Association yesterday to be used for the needs of relieving refugees.

### The Child Welfare Association is Doing its Best to Take in Refugee Children

Since the China Child Welfare Association established a refugee children's shelter in the war zone and started taking in children, the number of people has reached more than 150. In addition to providing them with daily rations, they also provide them with appropriate education. According to Mr. Chen Tiesheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Association, the war is now expanding, and the violent enemy is indiscriminately bombing all day long. Many children are displaced and have no one to take care of them because their parents were brutally killed. The number is large, and they are currently looking for a suitable address, a shelter that can accommodate thousands of refugee children. All children without parents aged from six to fourteen will be given shelter and rations as much as possible.

### The Situation in Shanxi

The situation in Shanxi is now indeed very serious. Since tens of thousands of enemy troops launched a general offensive on our entire line from the Northeast South Road on the 28th of last month, although they have encountered fierce resistance from our army at every turn, they have finally penetrated into the near suburbs of Taiyuan recently. Taiyuan is the only remaining political and economic center of importance north of our Yellow River. Now it may not be able to avoid being baptized by artillery fire. How this city will fare depends on the results of the bloody battle that our hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians are currently fighting against the violent enemy.

Judging from the overall situation, Taiyuan may fall into enemy hands sooner or later. However, we do not need to sigh for this reason. The glorious battles of the various Shanxi armies in the past have given us considerable satisfaction. Those heroic troops are still scattered throughout the mountainous areas of the province, ready to inflict heavy blows on the enemy at any time. Even if Taiyuan is unfortunately lost, the troops and civilians throughout Shanxi must clench their teeth and continue to fight the enemy to the death in the dangerous mountains. Moreover, the enemy has already suffered unexpected sacrifices and losses in the battle to attack Taiyuan, and it is not certain how successful they will be in the street fighting in Taiyuan City afterwards.

### On "Economic Reciprocity"

— Sun Huairen

Recently, Undersecretary of State Welles of the United States said: "The United States firmly believes that its principles for improving the international economy, if emulated in the Far East and adopted everywhere in the world, will certainly help solve the current problems." Then he said: "Recently, US Special Envoy Davis said that the Far East issue contains economic components, and at the same time, he declared that the United States advocates using these economic components as a prerequisite for resolving the war, which is based on the above-mentioned belief. Apart from this, the United States has no other practical suggestions." From this conversation, it can be seen that the United States currently seems to want to put up a sign of "economic reciprocity" to mediate the Sino-Japanese war in the Far East, which is very obvious. This kind of argument in the United States may be without malice, but we cannot deny that the United States has been poisoned by Japanese propaganda.

The idea of so-called international economic reciprocity, although it has had a rather long history since it was advocated by many liberal scholars, we cannot but admit that in this era when fascism is rampant, that classical idea of international economic reciprocity has indeed been declared dead. In other words, in this murderous world today, to talk about international economic reciprocity again can be said to be out of touch with reality. Regarding this point, the United States should really have a factual lesson. The failure of the 1933 World Economic Conference to succeed as the United States had hoped is not exactly saying that there is no real reciprocity in this world?

Originally, the term "economic reciprocity," just like the term "freedom," is a good term when used properly, and it becomes a sin when used improperly. In this world, true international economic reciprocity has become a wreck, but invaders can still use "economic reciprocity" as a guise for aggression. This time, the Sino-Japanese war is indeed our fault in Japan's view, saying that we cannot cooperate with it in politics and economics, but is this really the case? Putting aside the political aspect for the time being, let's just talk about the economic aspect. After the fall of the Northeast, we also talked about economic cooperation, tolerated humiliation, shamefacedly established trade associations, and politely came to the match-making joint venture. There are countless things like this. Can we still say that we do not have economic reciprocity with Japan? Now, Japan has deployed 500,000 troops on Chinese territory and started a military invasion, and we have started a sacred national war of resistance that we can no longer tolerate. Under these factual circumstances, if "the Far East issue contains economic components" and "these economic components are used as a prerequisite for resolving the war," and if Japan's economic reciprocity is used to end the war, is this not obviously a wrong observation?

To be honest, in Japan's mind, the economic reciprocity that it can be satisfied with is to call China an economic slave of Japan. Therefore, the economic components that the United States calls the prerequisites for resolving the war and that Japan can agree to, unless it is to call us to give in to being slaves, but I dare say that every Chinese with blood is intolerable. Therefore, we can very sincerely tell our friendly country, the United States, that in this Sino-Japanese war, there is no question of "economic reciprocity." When Japan's aggression does not stop, the so-called "reciprocity" is nothing more than Japan's "sole benefit." We do not deny that our economy is indeed very backward, and we are also very sincere in having genuine economic reciprocity with any country in the world, but in order for us to get genuine "reciprocity," all friendly countries should first support us and let us overthrow "pseudo-reciprocity." If the United States is going to suggest "economic reciprocity" in this Sino-Japanese war, it is really nothing less than destroying its own beliefs in the international economic principles, so that genuine international economic reciprocity will never be revived.

### Loan of 40,000 Yuan for Difficult People's Reclamation

Once the Loan is Successful, the Plan can be Realized

The Preparatory Committee of the War Zone Refugee Relocation Association, since the Jiangsu Provincial Government allocated vacant land in Gaochun and Liyang counties as refugee reclamation areas, the association has been actively preparing to cooperate with the Shanghai Branch of the Refugee Relief Association during the Extraordinary Period and the Joint Disaster Relief Association of various charitable organizations. It is currently organizing refugee registration, so that a batch of refugees can be sent to the reclamation area in the shortest possible time. It is also known that the association has appointed Qu Wenliu, Pan Gongzhan, and Wang Zhixin as representatives to negotiate a loan with the Farmers Bank for the refugee reclamation expenses. The amount is planned to be 40,000 yuan as the initial expenses. After the loan negotiation is successful, the refugee reclamation plan can be implemented step by step.

### Continued Subscription to National Salvation Bonds from All Sectors

Shaoxing's Seven Counties: The Shaoxing Seven Counties Sojourners Association in Shanghai convened all executive and supervisory committee members and sojourners from the seven counties of Shaoxing at the China United Trust Company on Beijing Road at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss actively promoting the subscription of public bonds. After the team leader, Wang Xiaolai, reported the significance of soliciting national salvation bonds, it was immediately decided that the attendees and executive and supervisory committee members would start soliciting donations today, reporting the results once a week, and designated the China United Trust Company and Tongyu Qianzhuang as collecting agencies.

Shangyu Gentry and Merchants: Wang Yansong and Pei Yunqing, natives of Shangyu residing in Shanghai, received a letter from the Shangyu County Government urging them to solicit national salvation bonds from Shangyu people in Shanghai. The two invited Shangyu gentry and merchants in Shanghai to a meeting at Yijia Chun restaurant yesterday to promote subscriptions.

### The Hu Wenhu Brothers' Enthusiastic Donation

National Salvation Bonds Subscription of 500,000 Yuan

And a Large Donation of Rescue Medical Supplies

The prominent overseas Chinese figures, the Hu Wenhu and Wenbao brothers, are extremely enthusiastic about supporting the country's all-out war of resistance. They have subscribed to national salvation bonds for a total of 500,000 yuan. As a standing committee member of the National Salvation Bond Fundraising Association, Hu personally departed to various ports in Malaya to discuss methods of subscribing public bonds with wealthy Chinese merchants. According to Hu, after the principal of the public bonds is repaid in the future, the funds will be used to run charitable and cultural undertakings and will not be recovered. This can also be advocated by overseas compatriots. Furthermore, Wanjin Oil and other medicines produced by the hall are urgently needed by the soldiers at the front and the refugees in the rear. The Nanjing Health Department, the city's慰勞 Committee, and the Women's慰勞 Sub-committee have sent letters and telegrams requesting donations. Hu Guigeng, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the hall, relayed them one by one. Hu immediately donated a total of forty cases of Wanjin Oil and Bagua Dan, two cases of Wanjin Oil Essence, catgut sutures, quinine cream, and other items, which have all been delivered and handed over to the Health Department for distribution to the North China and East China war zones. In addition, Hu purchased a large quantity of medicine, cotton, gauze, and other first-aid supplies from London and shipped them to Hong Kong for transfer to the front.

### Dutch Ship Chinese Seamen Resign to Resist Japan

Refuse to Transport Munitions to Japan

158 People Return Home

The Ziliwang, a wheel of a Dutch shipping company, travels to various ports in Java, Shanghai, and Japan. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, it has been loaded with large quantities of military materials from various parts of the Dutch East Indies to Japan. Seventy-five Chinese seamen on the ship refused to fuel the enemy's ferocity and aggression against their motherland and collectively resigned in Surabaya. The company reported the detention of all seamen to the local police and used various methods to force them to resume work. Among them, fifteen people would rather be shot than yield. This matter was reported in this newspaper. Later, my Deputy Consul Chen in Surabaya came forward to negotiate, but there was no satisfactory result. Subsequently, my Consul-General in Batavia reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and formally protested to the Dutch government. The company apologized to our consul, and the fifteen Chinese seamen who had been detained were also released. They have now returned home on the Zilikala. Since this incident, it has aroused the public anger of all the Chinese seamen employed by other ships of the company. To express their firm refusal to transport military materials to the enemy country and their unwillingness to indirectly fuel the enemy's aggression against their motherland, 158 Chinese seamen serving on the company's Zishun Dali, Zhimoluo, Zhijindi, and Zhibade have all resigned at the same time and returned home on the Zilikala. Although they sacrificed their jobs, they did not hesitate.

### After the Recovery of Songyin and Zhangyan, the Enemy Counterattacked Fiercely Last Night

Our Armies' Encirclement and Suppression of the Stubborn Enemy is No Longer a Concern

The Enemy's Several Attempts to Cross the South Bank of the Suzhou Creek Were Repelled

We are Holding Our Original Positions from North of Jiangqiao Town to Zhuyuan

The enemy who landed in Jinshanwei has indeed reached more than one brigade. Their forward outposts passed through Zhangyan and Songyin and reached Mishidu, attempting to cross the Huangpu River, attack Songjiang, and cut off the rear of our Shanghai garrison. We urgently dispatched reinforcements to encircle and flank from the left and right, while holding the natural barrier of the Huangpu River in the front. After three days and nights of bloody battles, the enemy's advance has been frustrated. According to the front-line battle report obtained by this newspaper this afternoon, after we cleared the stubborn resistance in Mishidu, we took advantage of the victory to pursue them. The two important strongholds of Songyin and Zhangyan were successively recovered yesterday afternoon. Last night, the enemy launched a large-scale counterattack. For a time, artillery fire roared, and the battle was fierce. They are still engaged in fierce battles in the vicinity of Zhangyan. As for our army that crossed the river from ××, its fierce attack on the enemy's right flank was extremely successful. Our ×× army encircled the left flank in separate routes. The overall situation is very encouraging. On the south bank of the Suzhou River, although there was a heavy rain yesterday, hand-to-hand combat between the two sides continued day and night. This morning, the weather cleared, and enemy planes were active again. The artillery fire was extremely fierce along the line from the Fanhua渡 Station to Zhoujiaqiao. Our heavy artillery also bombarded the enemy's positions. The enemy has been repeatedly repelled in their attempts to cross the river since dawn. As for the area south of Chenjiadu and near Beigongjiazhai, the enemy continues to reinforce. The enemy and we are still confronting each other across Xiaobin. The fierce fighting on the Zhujia浜 side has not stopped to this day. Our fresh troops are arriving in a steady stream. This line can be firmly defended. As for the line from north of Jiangqiao Town to Zhuyuan and Guangfuzhen, we are holding our original positions, and the enemy has not dared to invade easily.

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 7th: The enemy entrenched in Quan Gongting and Jin Si Niang Bridge launched an offensive toward Jinshanwei, Caojing, Zhangyan, Huangdai, Songyin, and Xincang after reinforcements arrived on the 6th, advancing northwest. After our army blocked them head-on and attacked from both sides along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway from Tuolin and Zhapu, the enemy's retreat route was cut off on the morning of the 7th, and they were surrounded on all sides. We are annihilating them separately and it will not be difficult to completely resolve them in a short time.

### Our Army Launches a Three-Pronged Encirclement of Enemy Troops in Southern Pudong

Songyin and Zhangyan Recovered in Succession

Simultaneous Flanking Attacks from the Left and Right Wings

The enemy that landed in Jinshanwei advanced north in an attempt to threaten Songjiang. Its reconnaissance troops, with isolated forces, went deep into the area and reached Mishidu on the shore of the Huangpu River via Zhangyan. The enemy divided its forces and advanced toward Tinglin and Yexie. Over the past three days, enemy forces have continued to reinforce, and the number of landings is estimated to be six to seven thousand. Yesterday, our army advanced rapidly in the heavy rain and suppressed the enemy forces in separate routes. The enemy forces that reached Mishidu were only a small number of forward infantry. After our army met them head-on with a heavy blow, the enemy at Mishidu retreated south. Our position along the Huangpu River is extremely solid, and it is difficult for the enemy to cross. Yesterday morning, our elite troops launched a fierce attack on the right flank of the enemy forces from □□. At the same time, fresh troops from □□ and other places also rushed to flank the left wing of the enemy forces, repelling the enemy near Xincang. The fierce battle of encirclement on three sides was very intense. According to a report from the front, our army made rapid progress last night and forced the enemy forces to retreat. After Songyin was recovered last night, Zhangyan was also recovered in succession. However, the enemy's forces were stubborn and still planned to resist. At the moment, Songyin and Zhangyan are all in fierce battles. It is difficult for the enemy to gain a foothold in this narrow and protruding position. After our army's vigorous attacks on all routes, annihilation is not far away.

### Full-Scale Artillery War on the South Bank of the Suzhou Creek This Morning

Significant Increase in Enemy Troops in the Liujiazhai Area

The Enemy Attempted to Cross the River Again on Zhongshan Road

Although the south bank of the Suzhou Creek was fiercely contested yesterday in the heavy rain, our army in the western section is still firmly holding the Zhujiazhai. The position is extremely solid. Although the enemy forces repeatedly attacked the Baziqiao, they were bravely repelled by our army. In the eastern section of Liujiazhai, the enemy continued to cross the river in the heavy rain yesterday, and the number greatly increased. They launched a fierce attack on Beigongjiazhai. Our army defended firmly along Xiaobin. In order to connect the east and west lines, the enemy forces attacked Zhangjiadu and Qujiaqiao. After our army's counterattack, only a small number of enemy forces were able to sneak in. This morning, the two armies were still engaged in fierce fighting north of Lincoln Road and Piers Road. Because the weather cleared up, both sides' artillery teams were extremely active. On Zhongshan Road, the enemy forces seemed to have intentions of crossing the river. Our artillery fire is concentrating on that point and bombarding them fiercely. Therefore, in addition to the infantry battle on the entire line, the artillery battle is also unfolding simultaneously.

Our Artillery War Against the Enemy in Caojiazhai

Central News Agency, accompanying army reporter reported at 12:50 PM on the 8th: After the enemy successively crossed the river and reinforced in Liujiazhai, they launched a fierce attack south. Chen Geng, our important stronghold north of Lincoln Road, was destroyed by enemy artillery fire. Today, the battle shifted to Caojiazhai, south of Lincoln Road. The enemy first bombarded us with artillery fire at 4:00 AM this morning, and we also returned fire and bombarded each other. At dawn, the enemy immediately launched an infantry attack, and enemy tanks also prepared to cross the river. Our artillery team destroyed their pontoon bridge. The fierce battle lasted until about 9:00 AM, and the enemy had suffered about 300 casualties. The battle is still in progress.

We Killed 400 Enemies in Zhangjiangdu

Central News Agency, accompanying army reporter reported at 12:50 PM on the 8th: At around 2:00 AM this morning, the enemy again crossed the river in the darkness in the area of Zhangjiangdu and Qujiaqiao. Our army had already detected it and immediately counterattacked in two routes. The enemy was caught off guard and annihilated by us, reaching 400 people. The remnants retreated to Caijiazhai and other places. It is expected that there will be more intense battles this afternoon.

### The Situation in Pudong Remains Stable

The Rumor That the Enemy Army Will Launch a Large-Scale Offensive is Not True

However, the Migration of Refugees is More Numerous, and Ferries are Forcefully Raising Fares

The situation in Pudong remains stable and there is absolutely no change. The rumor that the enemy army will launch a large-scale offensive is not true. According to the current situation, Pudong is no longer a must-contested place militarily. Moreover, the enemy army is currently focusing all its efforts on western Shanghai and the north bank of Hangzhou Bay. All the troops in Shanghai are distributed in the currently occupied positions and still feel stretched. Even if they divided their forces to attack Pudong, there were only intermittent machine gun sounds on the Huangpu River last night. Other than that, it was unusually quiet. This morning, three enemy planes flew low over various places to reconnaissance, but did not drop bombs. The reporter inspected the streets in the morning, and the order was unusually quiet. However, the number of migrants is more numerous than yesterday. Large and small ferries on the Huangpu River are forcefully raising fares, increasing the fare for each passenger from ten copper coins to one dime. Refugees are complaining endlessly, hoping that the police authorities will promptly take strict measures to maintain the restricted fare of ten copper coins to provide relief.

### The Enemy Attempts to Invade Jiangqiao Town

Central News Agency, accompanying army reporter reported at 12:50 PM on the 8th: The enemy army has a pattern of launching a full-scale offensive against our Jiangqiao Town. This morning, at around 4:00 AM, large groups of enemy troops were active from Zhuyuan, Guojiazhai, Lujiaxiang, Lijiaxiang to Jishan Temple. According to our reconnaissance, we have taken strict precautions.

### Enemy Aircraft Active This Morning

Nanshi: Two enemy bombers flew over the Gaochang Temple riverside docks in Nanshi around 8:00 AM this morning. They first strafed with machine guns, then dropped two bombs, one of which exploded, the other did not, but there was no damage. Enemy aircraft also dropped two bombs on Zhoujiadu, across the river from Gaochang Temple. Around 9:00 AM, two enemy aircraft continued to fly back and forth over the area, and at 9:15 AM, another bomb was dropped, creating a loud explosion. At the same time, two more enemy aircraft circled over the southern Huangpu River from Damatou to Gaochang Temple from early morning until noon, occasionally strafing with machine guns, causing civilian boats to avoid ferrying passengers. Therefore, the Gaochang Temple ferry boats did not carry passengers this morning, with only small boats risking crossings. At 9:20 AM, enemy aircraft flew over the Shanghai military camp and strafed with machine guns, injuring a woman on Guohuo Road, who was rescued by a fire brigade ambulance and sent to the hospital for treatment. This morning, the area from Bansongyuan to Gaochang Temple was bombed with five or six bombs in total. Road traffic was temporarily stopped by the militia to avoid danger.

West Shanghai: From 6:30 AM this morning, enemy aircraft were very active, especially towards West Shanghai, with an estimated twenty to thirty aircraft, all bombers. However, apart from a small number wreaking havoc along the Suzhou Creek, the rest went towards the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. Around 7:00 AM this morning, several enemy aircraft flew over the British garrison in West Shanghai, where they were repelled by British anti-aircraft fire and warnings, but they flew over several times later.

Pudong: This morning, the weather cleared up, and enemy aircraft flying out of Yangshupu and Wusong unleashed their power again. At 6:01 AM, enemy aircraft first took off from Yangshupu, with a team of three giant heavy bombers, followed by five teams in succession. At the same time, enemy aircraft from Wusong also took off one after another, all flying south along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway via West Shanghai. Around 7:00 AM, three reconnaissance aircraft were very active, flying over Pudong, Lan Ni Du, Zhoupu, Nanshi, and the Bund, circling for about fifteen minutes. Around 8:00 AM, one enemy aircraft returned to the skies over Nanshi for a second reconnaissance. At 8:30 AM, two more enemy aircraft flew out of Yangshupu, followed by three teams of heavy bombers, flying over Zhabei, the Public Concession, and Nanshi to the west end of Xinjing in northwest Shanghai. By 9:00 AM, the first batch of enemy aircraft had completely departed. In three hours, an estimated forty enemy aircraft had flown out. Afterwards, two or three aircraft at a time continued to fly back and forth.

### Enemy Warships Transporting More Artillery

Around 4:00 AM this morning (8th), two enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, No. 270 Guangyou Maru and Ganli Maru, sailed into Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu Wharf and the China Merchants Bureau's central pier, unloading fifty to sixty large and small cannons, as well as a large number of bullets. The Jiagutuo Maru, which sailed into Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's central pier, began transferring the large quantities of military supplies it was carrying into the transport ship Ganli Maru after 9:00 AM this morning.

### Nanshi Refugee Zone to Be Implemented Starting Tomorrow

Expanded Area Occupies One-Third of the Old City, All Measures Detailed This Morning

The refugee zone in Nanshi, initiated by the Shanghai International Committee and the Chinese Red Cross, has been thoroughly discussed for several days and finalized this morning, with all measures agreed upon and decided to be implemented from tomorrow (9th). According to those involved, the initial boundary of the refugee zone was set to end west of Anren Street, but after consultations with various sectors, it was deemed too small. Therefore, it has now been decided to expand it to the west of Xiaobeimen. The detailed area is south of Minguo Road, north of Fangbang Road, east of Fangbang Bridge, and west of Xiaodongmen, bordering the northern, eastern, and western parts of the French Concession, and the southern part of Fangbang Road, which runs east-west through the old city, occupying about one-third of the old city area. It has been decided to implement it from Tuesday (i.e., tomorrow), regardless of whether there is a signing or not. Security will still be maintained by the existing Nanshi police. Nanshi has never had troops stationed there, so there is no question of "withdrawal." The Shanghai International Relief Committee has obtained a membership permit from the municipal government and can go to the refugee zone for observation. The flags displayed in the refugee zone are the flags of the Chinese Red Cross and the Shanghai International Relief Committee.

### Japan Fears "Boycott" (Continued)

— Translated by Wutlai from Utley, USA

Anglo-American Economic Weapons Can End the War

Most till the land for landlords owning fifty or more mu of land, handing over more than half of the rice harvested each year to the landlords as rent. The landlords do not provide seeds, fertilizer, or capital. There are also farmers who own their own land, but although they can cultivate and harvest themselves, they have to pay extremely high interest rates on borrowed capital, so they are equally distressed. In short, almost every Japanese farmer is heavily in debt.

This feudal social and economic relationship still exists today, resulting in a very narrow domestic market. The rural people are extremely poor, and even when agricultural product prices are high, they are unable to accumulate capital to purchase machinery and innovate farming methods. This has led to a disproportionate industrial development, solely at the order of the state, operating export industries on a large scale using modern technology, such as textiles, as well as the manufacture of munitions. As for most domestic industries, they consist of just one owner and a few apprentices, sometimes with a few "runners," relying on manual manufacturing or using very little mechanical power.

The lower middle class, such as small landlords who exploit high interest rates, small industrialists, merchants, and artisans, are extremely numerous. They are all desperately poor and hate the industrial and commercial monopolists who control raw materials, loans, and foreign trade to the bone. High interest rates and a narrow domestic market make it impossible for small businesses to become prosperous, no matter how hard they work. Japan does not have middle class people who invest large sums of money. The capital in the country is controlled by a few zaibatsu families such as Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Yasuda. Although those with an annual income of over 1,200 yuan have to pay income tax, in 1931 only 569,046 people paid income tax. Only 20,524 people had an annual income of 5,000 yuan or more. The average income per person is about 800 yuan. However, there are twenty people with an annual income of between 300,000 and 1.5 million yuan. Only 730,000 people paid business profit tax, and all businesses with an annual net profit of 200 yuan or more had to pay this tax.

Although this concentration of capital makes it easier to pool the nation's income during wartime than in a country with a large middle class, it also makes Japan's social system extremely unstable in times of crisis. Farmers hate landlords and those who exploit high interest rates (who are actually agents of banks), and small industrialists and merchants hate the zaibatsu, creating a real volcano. The Japanese ruling class often uses propagandistic campaigns to prevent it from erupting. Since 1931, the authorities have turned social resentment into support for aggression against China, seizing Manchuria at one stroke and using the empty hope that Manchuria's future prosperity would bring the people supreme happiness to win over the people and prevent their rebellion. However, they have discovered that conquering China is not an easy task, and the people, whose belts are getting tighter every day, cannot tolerate the pain of a long war. It is conceivable what will happen then. Japan has gained nothing from occupying Manchuria, but has only increased the burden on its people. Japan now hopes to annex North China without a real war, but this will not provide any relief to the farmers and lower middle class. You cannot cure a poisoned person by stuffing their stomach with food. Japan's social structure has too many illnesses that cannot be cured by new colonies. There is a lot of wasteland in Manchuria, which is perfect for immigrants to cultivate, but only a few hundred Japanese farmers have gone to Manchuria. The Japanese government has not provided capital for immigrants to enter Manchuria, and this huge sum of capital will never be obtained as long as the Japanese zaibatsu and warlords hold power.

The danger today is that Britain only seeks to protect its investments in China before Japan tramples on China, and is afraid of the long-term effects of the war on Japan. Therefore, it will pressure the Chinese government to submit, even though the Chinese army has not been defeated. However, the vast majority of the Chinese people are determined to resist to the end, which is a real thing. The Chinese army has shown extraordinary courage and determination in Shanghai. Now, if Britain and the United States work together to boycott Japanese goods, China will almost certainly be able to defeat Japan. The current British government will never initiate economic pressure on Japan, because the British government wants to see the Japanese ruling class remain in power, and hopes to negotiate a bargain with Japan while pressuring China to cede the five provinces of North China to Japan in order to protect its investments.

However, if the United States decides to boycott Japanese goods and invokes the Neutrality Act to prevent selling goods to Japan on credit, the British government will have to take the same action as the United States. This move will be supported not only by the Liberal and Labour parties in Britain, but even by some parts of the Conservative Party. If the United States does not righteously help China for moral or electoral reasons, it may be motivated by the fact that one of Japan's main ambitions in North China is to turn North China into a large cotton-growing area, so that it will no longer have to rely on American cotton. Indeed, for the sake of the long-term interests of American cotton planters, it is worth boycotting Japanese silk for a few weeks. The interests of the United States in China, in terms of investment scope, cannot be compared with Britain, but in terms of commercial scope, it cannot be ignored.

Japan's finances were much stronger in 1922 than they are now, but at that time, Britain and the United States worked together and easily forced Japan to spit out the occupied territories in China. Therefore, if Britain and the United States exert political or economic pressure on Japan today, there is no reason to fear that the United States or Britain will be drawn into a war. Britain and the United States can end the war simply by hinting at cooperation to implement economic pressure on Japan. The United States was able to make Britain's policy consistent with its own in 1922, so why can't it do so in 1937? (Translated from the New York Nation)

### Li Rensheng Accused of Embezzling Refugee Food

Rented House to Store Rice and Sell It Continuously, Prosecuted for Embezzlement After Secret Report

Recently, there have been widespread rumors in the city about a director of a shelter embezzling refugee food and privately enriching himself. After investigation by reporters, the perpetrator of this incident is Li Rensheng (age 27) from Ningbo, who used to work in a bookstore at No. 154 Yuyuan Road. After the Shanghai war, he was introduced by Shen Binhan, director of the relief group of a charity organization, and sent to serve as the director of the Xinshi Shelter on the south side of the Shenyuan Ball Field. Unexpectedly, Li rented a back room in a living room from a Shi family at No. 3, Lane 196, Xiejiao Lane, on October 8, with a monthly rent of seven yuan. After renting the house, Li stored 50 bags of rice, worth about 669 yuan, in the room and sold it continuously. Recently, someone secretly reported to the General Patrol House, saying that the stored rice was obtained by Li by embezzling refugee food. Hua Detective Zhang Mingde and detectives Huang Fusen and Zhou Kaiwen investigated and arrested Li, and handed him over to the First Special Court last Saturday. The Patrol House lawyers Zhang Shizhu and Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for embezzlement. Because the Patrol House is currently investigating where Li sold the rice, the case has been postponed for another hearing.

### Stalin Inspects Red Army at 20th Anniversary of Soviet Revolution

Two Million People, Hundreds of Tanks and Airplanes. The Main Objective of the Celebration is Still Domestic Affairs.

[Moscow] The most important event in today's celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution was Stalin's grand review in Red Square. Two million people participated, including demonstrators and soldiers, as well as hundreds of tanks and airplanes. Defense Minister Voroshilov gave a speech, which was met with thunderous applause, stating that the Red Army exists for national defense and that the soldiers of the Red Army are protectors of civilization, but if attacked by the enemy in the future, they will respond with unprecedented offensive warfare. After Voroshilov finished his speech, 30,000 people sang the Internationale in unison, including many representatives from various countries and Outer Mongolia. During the parade, the masses displayed satirical images of Japanese, Italian, and fascist rulers on banners. However, the main themes of this celebration are still important domestic events such as the elections under the new constitution. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 7th)

### Far Eastern Situation

German Mediation Hopeless, U.S. and France in Agreement

[Berlin] The initial negotiations for Germany to mediate the Sino-Japanese War have no prospect of progress for the time being. Although political circles in France are very optimistic about this matter, it is heard that the Japanese conditions are extremely harsh. After the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is even more necessary to doubt whether Germany is absolutely fair and impartial. The Chinese side has also pointed out that Germany and China have not signed a similar agreement, and that General Chiang Kai-shek has achieved considerable success in the many years of anti-communist warfare. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 7th)

Brussels: The representatives of the countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference are now quietly awaiting Japan's reply, or taking a temporary break, or continuing to meet with each other. U.S. chief delegate Davis and French delegate Tedeschi had a long talk today. It is now believed that the two have mostly the same views on the problems of resolving the Far East dispute by peaceful means. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 7th)

### Random Comments

— Xiang

The Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy was signed the day before yesterday, and it is said that it contains secret clauses. Yesterday, the Soviet Union celebrated the 20th anniversary of its revolution. Lu Changxu encouraged the soldiers, saying that we have repeatedly replied to the belligerent elements, telling them that although we do not want war, we are not afraid of war. According to this situation, no matter what, a second world war can hardly be avoided. However, the line of the Second World War is naturally the opposition between the camp of peace and the camp of aggression. Therefore, whichever camp is large will be victorious, and whichever camp is united and consolidated will be dominant. Now the camp of aggression is shouting, jumping, blatant, and united, while the camp of peace is mostly fearful, shirking responsibility and perfunctorily. This situation can already be seen in the Nine-Power Treaty meeting. But the more you want to shirk responsibility, the more you may not be able to shirk it, and the more you want to perfunctorily, the more you may not be able to perfunctorily. Because now it has reached the final juncture, it is not the time to shirk responsibility and perfunctorily.

### On the Way to the Front (Continued)

— Special Correspondent's Communication from the Central News Agency, Shiheng

Coming out of the wounded soldiers' hospital, it was just past noon. According to the fixed plan, we went to visit an old missionary who had been preaching in this local area for more than 30 years at a nearby American Gospel Church. Readers may wonder why we still have the free time to watch this kind of person that is generally called a "religious parasite" at this time. Well, I would like to take this opportunity to explain some of my thoughts.

In recent times, the cultural workers of our country's intellectual class, from the standpoint of anti-imperialist cultural aggression, have given the most painful attacks to these missionary pastors who are the vanguards of aggression. Of course, no one can defend their preaching itself. Perhaps they are unconscious, but their enslaving education and religious superstition have indeed become tools of imperialist cultural aggression. However, we cannot forget their long history in the Chinese mainland and the close feelings they have with the average Chinese villagers after many years of living together. Although they are in the position of pastors, they are also unconsciously assimilated by the Chinese people. Their love for the average villagers is not entirely due to their hypocritical religion.

In the current period of national resistance against Japan, these pastors have their uses. Their external statements will be the best international propaganda. Moreover, among the pastors of various countries in the mainland, in addition to their religious mission, many still serve as correspondents for foreign newspapers in various places. Let’s talk about the pastor Peng that Mr. Chen introduced me to. In order to gain the trust of the Chinese people, the pastors in the mainland have all changed to Chinese names. He is the correspondent for a certain local mainland newspaper. A few years ago, when a group of American journalists came to Xuzhou, he introduced them to the local news media. Moreover, after the start of our country's resistance against Japan, he also sent a letter to the American ambassador stationed in Beijing, pointing out the inappropriateness of the initial attitude taken by the United States towards the Sino-Japanese war. There must be many such experienced pastors scattered throughout China. I think that if we give them assistance and encouragement from the side, it will achieve more results than letting them always do it automatically.

Unfortunately, Pastor Peng and two or three of his colleagues went to the countryside. We unfortunately did not meet.

Along the way, we also visited General ×××, the commander of the ××th Army Group who had newly stationed here. I will not describe his heroic posture here, nor will I praise the talents of the place. I am sure we will have opportunities to praise him in the future. He described that the Chinese soldiers have already developed extremely strong self-confidence in the resistance war. The certainty of final victory is deeply hidden in his heart and revealed in his eyes. This is the most profound impression that this visit left me.

That night, we waited for the train at Xuzhou Station from 7 o'clock until 4 o'clock in the morning, when the sky was about to dawn, the northbound train finally arrived.

When the train traveled to the Linyi area of Shandong, it was already the morning of the next day.

At 8:30, before arriving at the Jiehe Station not far from Yanzhou, the train stopped advancing due to an air raid alarm. The passengers got off the train to avoid it, and the train left the platform and hid in other places.

Following the crowd, I ran to a small village about half a mile east of the station and sat in a dry haystack room. First, I heard two bomb explosions in the distance. Then the plane circled in the sky above my head and dropped an egg. The sound was very loud, and my heart was shaking violently. Everyone guessed that this time, it must be somewhere not far from the train stop.

After lurking for a long time, people gradually gathered and sat under a big tree outside the village, chatting and waiting for the air raid alarm to be lifted.

I don't know where or when a peanut vendor appeared. He made an unexpected business. The travelers gathered under the tree all bought some to eat from him. He was a peasant of about forty years old, with an honest and loyal look on his face. He can be said to be a typical northern farmer. He weighed the peanuts and muttered,

"I won't give you less, elders. We just fled, so we don't dare to deceive people anymore."

"Where did you flee from?"

"Cangzhou."

"Do you still remember the situation in Cangzhou in the past?"

"How can I not remember? The ×× army opened the canal, and now it's all water, in order to block the Japanese soldiers. How can that block them? But the Daoci battle was fought very well, it was really 'officials and soldiers as one'."

"How did you escape?"

"Following the steel armored vehicles of the soldiers."

"Did the soldiers want you to sit?"

"If not, how can it be called 'officials and people as one'? The common people are doing their best to accommodate them, and they are very polite. But the common people are also worthy of them. When I was there, I sent them food every day. This time the war is very different from the previous Zhifeng and Zhizhi wars. At that time, no matter where the soldiers went, they couldn't find a ghost. This time, the common people themselves are willing to work for them, and they can get whatever they want. If you want to live in my house, just live in my house. If there is no white flour to eat, just make do with whatever you have." (To be continued)

### Commander Yang Upholds the Inspection of Commercial Goods, Officers and Soldiers Are Not Allowed to Obstruct

If Anyone Dares to Violate, They Can Be Named and Told

Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, after following the telegram order of the Commander-in-Chief to set up a passport registration and inspection office, requires that the transport of goods from organs must be released with a passport, while ordinary commercial goods are released with a certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to facilitate them. Now it is heard that some staff members are still not fully aware of this, and there are also cases of obstructing commercial goods with a certificate from the Chamber of Commerce. For example, at 2:30 PM on November 5, Liu Xiaozhang intercepted commercial goods at the entrance of the Maochang Optical Shop in Laobeimen. On the 6th, he detained the tools of Ban Zhengxing Iron Material Works at the same place. Also on the 5th, the personnel of the Nanshi Rice Market Wharf and the office in Chang Rice Company detained 100 jars of local yellow wine with tax bills and certificates from the Shanghai Liquor and Tobacco Tax Office, and even detained Zhu Suihua, the manager of Wansen Gong Liquor Workshop. Also on the 6th, Xin Cheng Coal Company was obstructed when transporting one ton of coal with a certificate. All of these are inappropriate. They were sternly ordered to follow the telegram order of the Commander-in-Chief in the future and not to obstruct the transportation of commercial goods in order to maintain rear production. If anyone dares to deliberately obstruct, it is hoped that the affected businesses will provide the address, date, and soldier number to tell the truth so that they can be punished according to the law.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Works Hard

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, according to a letter from the All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, requested to strictly supervise the staff to work actively. The reply stated, "In reply, we received your letter instructing us to strictly supervise the staff to actively step up their work, etc. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the work of this association has been several times that of peacetime. We have ordered the staff to actively work hard and have never made any mistakes. Before receiving your letter, we will naturally forward the instructions to encourage them to work harder to comfort our thoughts. We hereby reply for your reference."

The fish Japan Association has officially established in Shanghai. After deliberation, it was decided to send a circular telegram to the laboring class throughout the country to unite, mobilize, sacrifice everything, and resist to the end. I hope you will see it. The Chinese Laboring Class Salvation Association respectfully.

### Social Affairs Bureau Orders Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to Regulate Shanghai Grain Supply

Supervise Various Rice Industry Groups in Handling

The Shanghai Municipal Food Regulation Committee believes that with the new rice harvest entering the market, Shanghai rice merchants are rushing to purchase from the interior, ensuring no shortage of food for the city. After the eighth committee meeting of the committee resolved to conclude operations by the 7th of this month, in addition to announcing the conclusion with Announcement No. 10, the decision was reported to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau immediately instructed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, (omission above) stating that since the Chamber is the highest leader of commercial organizations and the Food Regulation Committee has concluded its work, the Chamber should be responsible for supervising the various rice industry groups in the city to properly handle matters related to food supply in the future. The chamber should comply with this order.

### Shanghai Rice Merchants Rush to Purchase from the Interior

Grain Reserves Increase, Ensuring Food Supply

Shanghai has a large population, and the monthly food supply requires approximately 100,000 dan. Therefore, Shanghai grain merchants always strive to purchase and store as much grain as possible. In this extraordinary period, the ability to ensure the food supply is due to sufficient reserves. According to reliable investigations, current reserves total 600,000 dan, enough to meet needs for half a year. Recently, although the war's westward shift has caused occasional transportation difficulties, the authorities of the Chinese Concession have made every effort to dredge the transport channels, allowing normal transport to continue. According to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter, this year's agricultural production in China has been bountiful, and the new grain harvest is now entering the market. Shanghai rice merchants have been rushing to purchase from the interior in order to acquire and store large quantities. Therefore, the supply of rice to Shanghai will steadily increase, reserves will certainly increase further, and there is absolutely no need to worry about food shortages.

### Municipal Federation Establishes Solicitations Committee for Comfort Activities

Since its establishment, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation Comfort Committee for Soldiers Fighting Against the Enemy has been very active in organizing comfort activities. The committee believes that as soldiers fight more fiercely, the public's comfort movement should also continue to advance. Therefore, the committee has resolved to invite enthusiastic people from all sectors of society, as well as all attending representatives from the committee's district branches, to form a solicitations committee responsible for handling all matters related to solicitations. Appointment letters were distributed yesterday, announcing the establishment of the committee.

### Youth Production Cooperative Strives to Relieve Refugees

To provide relief to refugees, the Youth Boy Scout Corps used their funds to establish a Youth Production Cooperative, enabling refugees to sell domestic goods and daily necessities (known externally as the August 13th Refugee Sales Group). The profits earned are used to support their livelihoods. Since the trial operation, it has been very effective. Therefore, the cooperative has decided to expand its scope of service, adding shoe-shining and craft groups, aiming to make further contributions.

### Record of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Charity Federation

Next, the following resolutions were passed: ㊀ The Design Committee of this association submitted the proposed measures for transplanting refugees to reclaim wasteland, which was referred by the fourth plenary committee meeting. The question was whether to approve the measures. "Attached measures" were approved. ㊁ With the westward shift of the war front, refugees are becoming increasingly crowded. As of the end of October, the association has only 117,456.99 yuan remaining in relief funds. Given the current situation, this is only sufficient for ten days. The question was how to proceed. The resolution was to make every effort to solicit donations. ㊂ Committee member Zhao Jinqing proposed that the spread of lung disease in the concessions has been exceptionally rampant recently. He has joined various charity groups to establish lung disease hospitals to provide relief. He proposed that this association also take on part of the work. The resolution was to share equal responsibility with the municipal relief effort and work together to advance the effort. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.

### Victory is in Our Grasp

— Liu Yucai

This invasion of China by Japanese imperialism can be said to be terribly out of touch with the times and to overreach its capabilities. It only knows how to rely on the rigid continental policy of Prime Minister Tanaka to forcefully seize Chinese territory. In reality, it is creating its own ultra-fast self-dug grave of utter defeat. We can prove this from the following points:

One, the military preparedness of various countries on the Pacific Ocean is becoming increasingly consolidated: the dramatic increase in the Soviet fleet. From these two aspects alone, Japanese imperialism is already in a precarious state and deeply fears the total destruction of its economic market that has been entrenched in North China for many years. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, it launched a preemptive strike, stirring up war clouds, hoping to sweep across North China in one breath and then peer into Central China, using this to consolidate its military base in North China and indirectly defend against the covetousness of other countries.

Two, Japanese imperialism also feels that the number of young soldiers in the country is increasing year by year. Under circumstances where there is absolutely no way out, these hotheaded young military figures are jumping around restlessly. Of course, their goal is for the young soldiers to occupy positions in military and political affairs. However, in order to implement this goal, they have no choice but to externally invade, making the current military figures impotent, old, and senile, and unable to handle the task. The faction of young soldiers takes this opportunity to rise up, shoulders the mission of invading China, and at the same time attempts to gain an important position in the military.

Three, because of the above two factors, and not daring to openly advocate for launching troops to invade China, the Japanese military authorities used the policy of deceiving the people with phrases like "China is Japan's lifeline" and "China is our source of gold" to confuse the minds of the Japanese people, while actively preparing for war and massively invading with military force. However, this kind of policy of deceiving the people by Japanese warlords has actually failed fundamentally. The people in Japan are filled with complaints, especially Japanese merchants who bitterly abhor the measures of their military authorities, causing foreign trade to plummet. Secondly, there is the unanimous opposition from regular soldiers within Japan. According to the Japanese military orders in peacetime, if three military orders are not issued, they can be immediately executed on the spot. This time, the military issued as many as eight military orders, summoning regular soldiers to go to China as tools of aggression. Under a united front of unanimous disregard, the regular soldiers resolutely defied these eight orders. The military authorities' policy of deceiving the people, which had been working hard, was completely destroyed at this point. At the same time, fearing that it would arouse resentment from the domestic people, and even cause riots! They dared not impose even the slightest punishment, only holding it in their hearts, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out.

Four, since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao incident and the subsequent start of the Shanghai Battle on August 13th, the international community has been in pain, and public opinion in China and abroad has criticized it based on reason. Under this situation of unanimous condemnation, the Japanese military authorities, feeling scorched and battered as they stumbled everywhere, realized that if they did not seek external assistance, they would become increasingly desperate and exhausted. Therefore, the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan was concluded in this situation. While using anti-communism as an outward pretext, it is actually a collection of aggressive fronts. This point we must recognize clearly. This is the Japanese bandits' remedial measure for self-recognized failure, but in fact, it conversely promotes powerful international sanctions.

In summary of the above points, we clearly confirm that the inevitable defeat of Japanese imperialism is a foregone conclusion. In addition, the economic foundation of Japan, due to its continuous invasion of China and the expansion of military expenditures, has been fundamentally collapsing. The situation of the people being poor and the wealth being exhausted means that it cannot but be defeated. On the other hand, from the standpoint of China's resistance, we can further prove from the following points that we have the certainty of victory:

One, China is a peace-loving country that has never wanted to easily provoke war. Our leader, Chairman Chiang, has long said: "We will never abandon peace until there is no hope for peace, and we will never lightly speak of sacrifice until the moment of ultimate sacrifice." Japanese imperialism provoked incidents in the Northeast on September 18th, occupied our three northeastern provinces, and again started war in Shanghai on January 28th, devastating our prosperous Zhabei district. We endured it, enduring such tragic injuries with patience and determination. How could we have known that the Japanese bandits would be insatiably greedy and then provoke a sudden invasion at Lugouqiao? This is when we have reached the point where we can no longer tolerate it. Peace has been despaired of, and the moment of sacrifice has also arrived. Our entire country unanimously exerted the self-defense force of resistance to fight the enemy to the death. This is the unanimous demand of the people across the country, and its power is extremely strong. History tells us that in a war, victory belongs to the side that is supported and assisted by the people. Now, 450 million people across China are united in the consistent spirit of all-out resistance, under the guidance of the government and the supreme leader. With this power, it can be believed that there is full confidence in victory.

Two, at the same time, most peace-loving countries around the world, seeing such a brutal robber who, after invading China, will further attempt to conquer other countries, also righteously condemn the Japanese, giving direct and indirect heavy blows to the Japanese bandits in spirit and in material. Ask yourself: on our side is the conscious and vigorous resistance of the people across the country, while on the enemy's side is the unreliability of the policy of deceiving the people, which will lead to internal strife. On our side is the sympathy and support of most countries in the world, while on the enemy's side is the temporary collusion of robbers engaging in looting. Comparing these situations, anyone can clearly see that our steps are day by day moving onto the bright road to victory.

Three, on the other hand, we can see that the economic bankruptcy within Japan and the resentment of the people against the military's reckless war flames are sufficient to make the enemy deal with thorny issues, directly and indirectly affecting the unsustainability of the invasion of China. We are cooperating with it with a long-term resistance strategy, which is precisely giving it a precursor to an accelerated failure. We see that Prime Minister Konoe's policy of advocating for a quick victory is even more revealing of their internal panic.

Four, the Japanese bandits' ambition for aggression is not only to conquer China, but also to conquer the world, with the intention of controlling all countries, which is the purpose of the so-called continental policy. But in fact, what is being created is a suicide policy. Aside from temporary collusion with those who share the same ambition for aggression, no other country will be coerced by you. Even Korea, which has been conquered by the Japanese bandits for a long time, has seen latent revolutionary forces now rising up. Their groups, such as the Comrade Society and the National Association, have unanimously united to resist Japanese imperialism, destroy the chains of oppression, and take the same steps as us to overthrow Japanese imperialism and restore Korea's independence and freedom. At the same time, they are also annihilating the robbers of world peace. This is precisely erecting a new force of the world's small and weak nations to resist Japanese imperialism. The world's peace-loving nations will continue to rise up and jointly punish this aggressive robber. The result of this blow. The defeat of Japanese imperialism is purely a foregone conclusion.

People across the country, arm yourselves unanimously to launch the power of all-out resistance, and overthrow the world's robber, Japanese imperialism! The final victory belongs to us.
