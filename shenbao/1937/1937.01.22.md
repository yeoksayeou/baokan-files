Current Commentary

### US President Roosevelt's Inauguration

— Star

Like the British King's coronation ceremony in May of this year, US President Roosevelt's inauguration ceremony adds much excitement to 1937. This excitement utilizes the latest scientific inventions, allowing people all over the world to participate simultaneously. Roosevelt's inaugural address, along with the cheers of 300,000 people, was broadcast by the Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications. We, on this side of the globe, could also hear it. The inauguration of the US President has been held on March 4th since Washington's time. It was only when the US amended its constitution two years ago that the inauguration date was moved forward. This new beginning seems to symbolize that from the date of Roosevelt's second inauguration, US history may open a new era.

However, the most noteworthy aspect of this inauguration ceremony is not the innovative inaugural address, but the reviewing stand with its retro nature. President Roosevelt deliberately built a reviewing stand in the style of President Jackson's residence in 1829, which is deeply meaningful. According to the media mogul Hearst, no president in US history has won such enthusiastic support from the masses as Roosevelt, except for Jackson. And Roosevelt also implicitly imitated Jackson. On the day of last year's election, he wore Jackson's watch chain. At the previous Jackson commemorative banquet, he used everything during Jackson's term to compare his own achievements. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to speculate on Roosevelt's future using everything of this great politician of the Democratic Party a hundred years ago.

Many of Jackson's experiences are similar to Roosevelt's. At the beginning of Jackson's tenure, he started large-scale construction projects, opening waterways and building roads. Roosevelt's work relief policy also resulted in the construction of many great projects, such as large dams and bridges. Jackson appointed private individuals and recruited partisans, starting the US spoils system. Within two years of Roosevelt's first inauguration, he gave over 100,000 new positions to Democrats. Jackson broke the conventions of the cabinet and created the so-called "Kitchen Cabinet," deciding policies without consulting with various ministers, but only having secret talks with a few confidants. Roosevelt also has the so-called "Brain Trust" organization. All innovative plans are planned by a few professors. Jackson implemented currency devaluation. Roosevelt devalued the price of the US dollar to 59% in January 1934. Jackson had great contempt for the Supreme Court, not allowing the Supreme Court to interfere with administrative and legislative powers. Roosevelt hates even more the Supreme Court's declaration that the new law is unconstitutional. He may reorganize the Supreme Court within the next four years.

Jackson was elected twice and won great support from the people. In the last two years of his second term, as a result of the monetary expansion policy, real estate prices soared, and the United States reached an unprecedented state of prosperity. However, artificial prosperity is, after all, a castle in the air. When his second term expired, the United States entered a great economic panic. Roosevelt's policies and ambitions are quite similar to Jackson's, although one is a clever politician and the other is a bold soldier. But the desire for greatness and the will to move forward are quite the same. In the next four years, Roosevelt may be doomed to repeat Jackson's fate.

### Chaos in Japanese Parliament, Hirota Leaves Without Finishing Speech

Every Word Provokes Questions; Emperor Orders Parliament to Adjourn for Two Days

[Tokyo] The Japanese Parliament opened today for the first time in the magnificent new hall. The whole nation is paying close attention. (21st Reuters dispatch)

[Tokyo] This afternoon, when Prime Minister Hirota was giving a speech in the House of Representatives, every word he uttered was met with questions, causing a noisy uproar. The speech could no longer be heard. The Prime Minister was very angry, packed up his documents, stepped down from the podium, and walked quickly out of the hall. Other cabinet members' speeches were also disrupted in the same way. Amidst jeers, there were shouts of "No, no." In particular, the most questions were raised during the speech by Finance Minister Baba. However, Baba ignored them and completed his speech. This morning, when the House of Peers met, the speeches of the cabinet members were very quiet, but no one expressed welcome. All the members of the House remained silent and listened quietly, without any cheers. (February 10th Reuters dispatch)

[Tokyo] The imperial rescript to adjourn Parliament is as follows: I, in accordance with Article 7 of the Constitution of the Empire of Japan, order the Imperial Parliament to suspend its session for two days, from January 22nd to 23rd. Under the Imperial Seal, January 22nd, Showa 12th year, co-signed by various Ministers of State. (22nd Allied News dispatch)

### Hamada Attacks Military Interference in Politics, Causing a Great Disturbance

Minister of the Army Considers it Insulting; Hamada Willing to Commit Seppuku as Apology; Military and Political Parties Hold Meetings

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives convened at 1:12 PM with the sound of the bell. The assembly hall and the public gallery were filled to capacity. Speaker Tomita, after various reports, announced the opening of the session at 2:10 PM. The Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister each delivered speeches. When the Finance Minister reached the budget proposal, a Diet member shouted, "Know shame!" causing a commotion in the hall. The atmosphere became tense. At 2:40 PM, the financial speech concluded, and the first round of questioning began. Yukio Sakurauchi of the Rikken Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party) took the stage and stated to Prime Minister Hirota that the current cabinet's greatest mission lies in military discipline and the implementation of fresh governance, but its actual achievements are negligible, which is regrettable. Next, Kunimatsu Hamada of the Rikken Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party) took the stage to clarify the current cabinet's constitutional operation and the position of Japanese political parties in the constitution. He stated that the new system of military-civilian unity is unsuitable for the spirit of the constitution and fundamentally flawed in concept, explaining the harm of military interference in politics. He also said that Japan's industrial production has doubled since the Manchurian Incident, while the military budget has tripled, leading to high prices and threatening the lives of the people. Budget inefficiency is a natural consequence. The House of Representatives, which holds the power to deliberate the budget, should not be intimidated by any pressure in cultivating national economic strength, the so-called broad national defense, and should deliberate carefully. Under the political conscience, the budget and tax increase proposals should be dealt with appropriately to meet the demands of the people. As for the current deadlocked diplomatic issues, they are roughly as follows:

㊀ Diplomatic relations with China are on the verge of complete collapse.

㊁ The Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty is in danger of not being ratified.

㊂ The Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany has caused many misunderstandings at home and abroad.

Regarding the truth of the stalemate in diplomatic relations with China, the government should first explain everything in detail to the people to maintain national diplomacy. The reason why the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty cannot be ratified is due to friction caused by the aftermath of the Japan-Germany Agreement, which is a publicly recognized fact. The conclusion of international treaties is the exercise of great power and should be approved by the Privy Council before ratification; otherwise, it is an insult to the country and a loss of national prestige. In accordance with Japan's unique national polity and the established path of constitutional responsibility, the current cabinet should take full responsibility for the failure to obtain ratification. This matter has a significant impact on the important task of assisting the Emperor and on national thought. The government should give a clear response with a solemn attitude, said Mr. Hamada, who concluded with a passionate shout, "Please abandon the military's sense of superiority," and then stepped down from the stage.

Prime Minister Hirota replied that at the present time, there is considerable criticism of the military's driving force, strongly believing it is a fascist method, but now we respect political parties and hope for their assistance.

Minister of the Army Terauchi replied that it would be an illusion to say that there is a special tendency in Japan's political movements. It is regrettable that Mr. Hamada's arguments seem to criticize a part of the military, which violates the spirit of military-civilian unity.

Foreign Minister Arita replied that Sino-Japanese negotiations have not reached a stalemate, and Sino-Japanese friendship has been a long-standing goal that has not yet been fully realized. To take a very small part of a long history and call it a failure is probably not a fair argument. There are various objections to the Japan-Germany Agreement, but it was unavoidable. The relationship between Japan and the United Kingdom is the same as in the era of the alliance, and there is no change. The Fisheries Treaty has not yet been signed and should not be used as an excuse. It is illegal for the Soviet Union to use it as an excuse, and I should not bear any responsibility.

Hamada took the stage again, stating that the Minister of the Army had said that his words insulted the Imperial Army, and asked again, demanding an immediate answer. The Minister of the Army said he was merely urging him to pay attention. Hamada then asked for the record to be checked quickly, saying that if it was found that he had made such remarks insulting the military, he would commit seppuku on the spot as an apology; if there were no such words, the Minister of the Army should take responsibility. After saying this, his face turned pale, and the assembly hall was filled with a somber atmosphere. The Minister of the Army replied that he would check later. The session adjourned at 6:20 PM. (Kyodo News, 21st)

[Tokyo] The government believes that the atmosphere in both houses, especially the questions raised by Kunimatsu Hamada in the House of Representatives, is not only completely opposed to the government but also makes it difficult for the military, which is striving for military discipline, to tolerate, leading to strong opinions. Therefore, as a result of holding an emergency cabinet meeting after the Diet session adjourned, the Prime Minister proceeded to visit the Emperor, and the situation is rapidly becoming serious. (Kyodo News, 21st)

[Tokyo] Regarding Mr. Kunimatsu Hamada's speech, the Army held a meeting of its leadership after the Diet session adjourned to discuss countermeasures. They will make a statement in the House of Representatives on the 22nd, believing that Hamada's speech clearly insulted the Imperial Army, which is difficult to condone, and for the sake of the Imperial Army's honor, it cannot be tolerated. The impact within the department is very large, so they will take a very strong attitude and plan to have the Minister of the Army ask Hamada to retract his remarks in the Diet on the 22nd. (Kyodo News, 21st)

[Tokyo] The Navy held a meeting of its leadership in the government committee room in the Diet at 7:50 PM on the 21st. Attendees included Navy Minister Nagano, Vice Minister Yamamoto, and Director of Military Affairs Bureau Toyoda. They decided on the Navy's attitude toward Hamada's speech and held an important meeting. (Kyodo News, 21st)

[Tokyo] Regarding Minister of the Army Terauchi's remarks about advising Hamada, etc., the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party) considered it regrettable and held a meeting of its executives after the Diet session adjourned on the 21st. The results are as follows: Freedom of speech in the Diet should not be restricted as it would set a bad precedent, so it is inconvenient to remain silent. The Speaker should be informed and asked to request Minister of the Army Terauchi to retract his remarks. Their opinions on this matter have become unified and a meeting of executives will be held on the morning of the 22nd to make a final decision.

Also, Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party) President Machida invited both lower and upper house Diet members Sakurauchi and Koizumi and Secretary-General Nagai to his residence at 10:00 PM on the 21st to hold an important meeting of the leadership regarding the major changes in the political situation. (Kyodo News, 21st)

### Japanese Military Again Issues Pamphlet

[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of the Army today published a pamphlet explaining the justification for the huge military budget and the need for a powerful army, and made many criticisms of the major powers, especially Britain and Soviet Russia. It is said that Britain is interfering with Japan's "continental policy" everywhere and is clearly trying to undermine the establishment of peace in East Asia and the realization of Sino-Japanese friendship. The pamphlet continued that Japan must prepare because Soviet Russia's attitude of provocation is no longer concealable. As for the desires in the heart of the United States, it is actually trying to seize control of the Pacific Ocean and increase its position in the Chinese market, so the United States has recently been intensifying its efforts to increase its naval and defense forces in the Pacific. According to the Hochi Shimbun, the Japanese military is quite dissatisfied with the attitude of the two major political parties, the Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party) and the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party), believing that the two major political parties are not at all concerned about the urgency of the current situation. (Reuters, 21st)

### Foreign Minister Arita Explains Diplomatic Policy

Continuing to Adjust Relations with China and Russia; Becoming Friendly with Germany and Italy and then Compromising with Britain and the United States

[Tokyo] The 70th Diet officially opened today, and the government and political parties began discussing national policy in the new Diet building at a time of extraordinary domestic and foreign affairs. The House of Peers convened at 10:00 AM, and Prime Minister Hirota first took the stage to deliver a speech explaining the government's policy direction, followed by the Foreign Minister's speech on diplomatic policy. After the two ministers' speeches, Watanabe Chika, representative of the research group, issued the first question to the government. The House of Representatives convened at 1:00 PM. After Prime Minister Hirota and Foreign Minister Arita spoke, Finance Minister Baba spoke on financial policy. Then Sakurauchi Yukio, representative of the Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party), was the vanguard in questioning and made a scathing criticism of the government's general problems in domestic and foreign affairs. (Kyodo News, 21st)

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Arita said in the Diet today, summarized as follows: Today I have the opportunity to state the outline of the Empire's diplomatic policy and its current situation in this House, which I consider an honor. The Empire's national policy, as stated in the special Diet in May of last year, is still to ensure stability in East Asia, to contribute to world peace, and at the same time to establish international justice to promote the welfare of mankind. Since then, we have been working diligently to achieve this goal and have never slackened.

Sino-Japanese Negotiations

The Empire's government, recognizing the importance of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, advocated the Three Principles for China, hoping to achieve the adjustment of the Chengdu Incident under this policy. Thereafter, the Bei Hai Incident and other unfortunate events continued to occur. We have always carefully considered these events. The resolution of these events themselves is necessary, but unless the fundamental cause is removed at the same time, it will be impossible to prevent their recurrence. It will be impossible to protect the safety of Japanese residents' lives and property and the Empire's rights and interests. From the beginning of September for more than three months, representatives of both sides negotiated repeatedly in Nanjing. As a result, both the Chengdu and Bei Hai incidents were resolved on December 30th. Although negotiations have not achieved the desired results, they are currently at a standstill, but I firmly believe that the negotiations to date have a significant meaning for the stage of future development. Japan's fundamental policy toward China is in Sino-Japanese cooperation and in coexistence and co-prosperity, which goes without saying. Therefore, I firmly believe that making new efforts and engaging in adjustment again is the duty of both governments and the hope of both nations. At the time of the Xi'an Incident, the government of the country observed the development of the situation quietly with a fair and upright attitude and great concern. Fortunately, it did not develop into a major incident and was brought under control, which is especially worthy of congratulation for the neighboring country. This matter, at the beginning, had the background of Zhang Xueliang advocating for accommodating communism and resisting Japan. Therefore, the beginning and end of this incident have a significant impact from the perspective of the overall situation in East Asia. Therefore, the Empire's government has been paying close attention to the trend of the incident.

Friendship with Italy

Previously, the Empire's government notified the Italian government of the intention to abolish the Empire's Legation in Afghanistan and establish a consulate. At the same time, the Italian government also stated that it would give friendly consideration to the protection of the Empire's commercial and other interests in Afghanistan. Currently, based on this intention, we are proceeding with discussions to conclude an agreement. This is nothing more than the Empire's government taking appropriate measures in consideration of the actual situation and the friendly relations with Italy.

Policy Toward Russia

The Empire's policy toward the Soviet Union is to establish and maintain normal relations, which goes without saying. The Empire's government believes that resolving various outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union is the way to improve good neighborly relations between the two countries. Therefore, from this perspective, last year we negotiated on the revision of the Fisheries Treaty, the determination of the "Manchukuo"-Soviet border, and the handling of disputes. At the same time, regarding the extension of the test drilling in Northern Sakhalin, we assisted the negotiations between the representatives of Japanese businesses and the Soviet government authorities.

Regarding the oil issue, last October, a contract was established between the representatives of Japanese businesses and the Soviet government authorities to extend the test drilling period for five years. Also, after a year and a half of negotiations, the new Fisheries Agreement had been finalized by mid-November of last year and was about to be signed. However, the Soviet government suddenly claimed that domestic procedures had not been completed and requested a postponement of the signing. Since then, it has not agreed to sign. Japan believes that the nature of the North Pacific fishing rights and the Fisheries Treaty that stipulates their exercise should not be interrupted and has repeatedly drawn the attention of the Soviet Union. As a result of negotiations, a temporary agreement was concluded on December 28th of last year to allow fishing this year to proceed smoothly. As for the negotiations on the signing of the agreement, they will naturally continue and we hope for a resolution. Also, the establishment of the "Manchukuo"-Soviet border demarcation and dispute resolution committee is considered to contribute greatly to preventing disputes between Japan, "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union. It is also of great benefit to adjusting the national relations between the three countries. Therefore, from this point of view, it was promoted by Japan. On the issue of the principles of this matter, opinions have already been agreed on except for one or two points. The Empire's government strongly hopes that this issue can be resolved quickly.

The Empire's government is so committed to establishing peaceful relations with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union not only maintains unbalanced military preparations on the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border, but even calls Japan's actions aggressive, which I deeply regret. I firmly believe that the Soviet Union must understand the Empire's peaceful intentions, reflect on its past attitude, and resolve the various issues between the two countries in order to normalize Japan-Soviet relations.

Japan-Manchukuo Relations

As I said in the previous Diet, the Empire's government will further promote the integration of the Japanese and "Manchukuo" people to further strengthen the inseparable good neighborly relationship between the two countries. For this reason, under the policy of abolishing extraterritoriality in "Manchukuo" and adjusting and even transferring the administrative rights of the South Manchuria Railway affiliated areas, the first stage was completed on June 10th of last year with the conclusion of the treaty with "Manchukuo" on abolishing part of extraterritoriality and adjusting the administrative rights of the South Manchuria Railway affiliated areas. Also, the economic relationship between Japan and "Manchukuo" is becoming increasingly close, which is especially worthy of celebration.

Toward Britain and the United States

Regarding Britain, the Empire's government's policy of strengthening the traditional relationship between Japan and Britain has not changed in the slightest. From the perspective of the overall situation of the two countries, Britain's position toward Japan, Japan's position toward Britain, and giving full sympathy to consideration, the conflict of interests of the two countries will naturally have a way to adjust, without any doubt. The Empire's government will make continuous efforts for this purpose.

The relationship with the United States has recently become increasingly good. This is partly due to the Empire's established policy of ensuring peace in the Pacific between Japan and the United States, and partly because the United States is gradually understanding the situation in East Asia. This friendly relationship should be further enhanced today.

International Trade

The Empire's government hopes to maintain close economic relations with the South Pacific region, but there are various slanders or misunderstandings about this hope. However, the Empire's government does not harbor any aggressive intentions, but only hopes to promote trade development and resource development by enhancing peaceful and friendly relations.

Although various restrictions are adopted by foreign countries on Japan's trade, the total amount reached an unprecedented high last year, which is enough to indicate the extraordinary vitality of Japan's economy and industry. However, this trend should not be relied upon for long. At this time of complex international economic situation, maintaining the stability of the original price depends a lot on the use of foreign exchange. At the end of last year, the government implemented revised ministerial ordinances based on the Foreign Exchange Control Law and, in view of the recent trends such as increased imports, sought temporary emergency measures. The government will pay attention to the international movement of ordinary capital in the future and will seek comprehensive measures to prevent capital flight and exchange rate fluctuations according to the situation. At the same time, in the actual management of exchange operations, it is intended to pay close attention to not giving obstacles to industry and trade.

Opening Up Markets

In addition to these diplomatic negotiations, the Empire's government is devoting all its efforts to maintaining and developing old markets and opening up new markets around the world in order to promote Japan's trade. In the special Diet last spring, it was said that the scope of measures that hinder international trade tends to expand. This is very important for countries like Japan, which have no choice but to secure the supply of raw materials and the sales of products overseas to maintain the national economy. Since then, there seems to have been a slight evidence of the easing of these restrictive measures, but the various restrictions to carry out this matter still exist. I firmly believe that what is most necessary at this time is for all countries to apply the spirit of fair treaties, such as the Congo Basin Treaty, in their colonial markets for the sake of realizing freedom of trade to a minimum. I believe that this, together with the recent study and realization of the problem of raw material resource allocation, is an effective and appropriate method for easing the world's anxiety and contributing to peace. Cultural Projects

Finally, I have one thing to say about cultural projects. The culture of a country is the expression of its national character. Understanding it is to fundamentally recognize the country, and then can establish international justice and realize true international cooperation. Especially for countries like Japan with the oldest special culture, it is a necessary act to promote it to the world in a big way so that the world can fully understand Japan's active spirit. Therefore, the government is making more efforts in this business from this point of view.

The above is the government's diplomatic policy and the outline of recent diplomatic progress. Under the current complex and subtle domestic and foreign situation, we must carefully deal with the many difficulties encountered by the Empire without a gap between the government and the public in order to avoid mistakes. This goes without saying. For the implementation of national policy, I firmly believe that we must unite the country and pay full attention to it. This is what I sincerely hope for your continuous cooperation. (Kyodo News, 21st)

### Prime Minister Hirota's Policy Speech

[Tokyo] The first day of the House of Peers convened at 10:16 AM. Prime Minister Hirota began by giving a policy speech, the main points of which are as follows: Looking at the domestic and foreign situation of the Empire, there are many problems at home, such as thought, national defense, industry, economy, finance, education, and others, lying before us. Abroad, the world situation is chaotic and unclear. The international political situation surrounding the Empire is becoming increasingly subtle, and various foreign problems are becoming more complex. Therefore, we must be aware that the Empire's future has many difficulties lying before us. In order to eliminate these difficulties and promote the expansion of national fortune, we must declare the Empire's lofty mission to the world so that it has a correct understanding. Domestically, we must thoroughly plan various facilities and operations, and achieve the reality of reforming all kinds of governance in order to strengthen national power. The foundation lies in the bright and glorious concept of the national polity, so that various domestic and foreign policies are integrated with it seamlessly, and we revitalize the national spirit. With the Japanese Imperial Family as the center, the determination of national unity, unity, and indomitability is the sincerity of its tempering. This is the basic tone of the government's support for the justice of revitalizing the country. The Empire's diplomatic policy is consistent with the above-mentioned mission of the Empire and has never changed. Based on the above-mentioned fundamental policy, the government will further strengthen the special inseparable relationship with "Manchukuo," and from the perspective of ensuring the status as a force for stability in East Asia and maintaining permanent peace in East Asia, it firmly believes that it is necessary to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. Therefore, we strive to achieve the reality of good neighborliness and cooperation. Next, I would like to state the important policies that the current cabinet intends to realize in connection with the Showa 12 fiscal year budget. Based on the policies stated at the 69th Imperial Diet last spring, we have been diligently working to concretize the policies. As a result, the government has decided to enrich national defense and other seven specific policies. For the sake of implementation, the necessary budget bill and law bill will be submitted to this Diet. It was also said in the previous Diet that there are many things that should be improved in general governance, but in view of the current domestic and foreign situation and the current state of finance, we will concentrate on the most urgent matters that must be realized in any case. Let me describe them separately:

㊀ Enriching national defense,

㊁ Refreshing and improving education,

㊂ Reorganizing the central and local tax systems,

㊃ Stabilizing national life,

㊄ Promoting industry and expanding trade,

㊅ Establishing important national policies for Manchuria,

㊆ Reorganizing and improving the administrative structure. (Domei News Agency, 21st)

### Finance Minister Baba's Speech on Finance

[Tokyo] The gist of Finance Minister Baba's speech is as follows:

The budget for Showa 12 is a considerable increase compared to the previous year, and temporary expenses related to national policies will still need to be added in the future, so the expansion of bonds will inevitably continue for the time being. This time, for the above situation, there are plans to increase taxes and other revenue increases, and there are also regular annual revenue increases. Therefore, the total amount of public bonds issued in the next few years will be roughly the same as the total amount in the 12th fiscal year. After that, the number of public bonds is expected to gradually decrease. Taking this opportunity, I will briefly explain the government's financial and economic policies. In order to expect sound development of industry and trade and to reduce the financial burden on the entire nation, the government has been observing the actual situation of the financial world and implementing a low-interest policy since the cabinet was formed, and the government continues to hope that low interest will gradually proceed. Also, from May 1st to September 15th of last year, it borrowed five-percent national treasury bonds totaling more than 2.1 billion yen and used three-and-a-half-percent national treasury bonds. However, the government intends to temporarily maintain the current interest rate level for national debt, and it is also planned to implement borrowing and lowering interest rates on the remaining five-percent and four-and-a-half-percent public bonds of more than 2.9 billion yen at an appropriate time. The total amount of foreign trade last year, including domestic and foreign imports and exports, reached more than 5.725 billion yen, indicating a new record for Japan's trade market, which can be considered smooth. However, this trend should not be relied upon for long. At this time of complex international economic situation, maintaining the stability of the original price requires the use of foreign exchange. At the end of last year, the government implemented revised ministerial ordinances based on the Foreign Exchange Control Law, and in view of recent trends such as increased imports, sought temporary emergency measures. The government will pay attention to the international movement of ordinary capital in the future and will seek comprehensive measures to prevent capital flight and exchange rate fluctuations according to the situation. At the same time, in the actual management of exchange operations, it is intended to pay close attention to not giving obstacles to industry and trade. (Domei News Agency, 21st)

### England and France Agree on Negotiation Policy Towards Germany

Economic Aid Must Not Expand Armaments; German Newspapers Also Say They Are Willing to Cooperate with All Countries

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden went to Geneva yesterday, then to Paris, and had talks with French Prime Minister Léon Blum. Political figures here have received a telegram from Paris, learning that the two sides have agreed that any future economic and financial assistance to Germany must be subject to two conditions: ① Other countries in need of assistance should enjoy the same treatment as Germany; ② This assistance, under no circumstances, should be used to expand armaments. Political figures have expressed satisfaction with this news. Moreover, since French Minister of National Defense Daladier was also present at yesterday's talks, it is believed that the gradual reduction of armaments by all countries and the publication of military budgets were also discussed together. However, it is doubtful whether this can lead to a concrete compromise with Germany. According to news from Berlin, Germany is unwilling to consider any plan that requires Germany to change its current policies, methods, and objectives to solve general European problems. (Havas, 21st)

[Berlin] German newspapers have commented on Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons. They expressed agreement with Eden's statement that the only way to solve the Spanish problem is through "Spaniards for Spain." However, they expressed regret that the Foreign Secretary failed to clarify whether Britain is willing to use its influence to rebuild Spanish sovereignty. Regarding Eden's advice to Germany, the newspapers believe that Germany has always expressed its willingness to cooperate with all countries, as evidenced by numerous proposals. However, cooperation must be limited to countries that strive for public well-being. The newspapers also agree that Eden sees trust as a prerequisite for cooperation, and they say that the German people must be given the opportunity to develop trust, so that they can trust their former enemies who now harbor good intentions. Regarding Eden's proposal to realize international cooperation within the framework of the League of Nations, the newspapers expressed distrust. They believe that the collectivism of Geneva cannot eliminate the world's disputes, and that the agreements made behind the scenes of the League of Nations not only cannot eliminate the unease in Europe, but can actually increase it. It is better for Germany to build a system of direct friendly relations, which can achieve practical results and improve the European situation. (National Telegram, 20th)

[Rome] It was learned today that the attitudes of Italy and Germany towards the European situation have become increasingly clear since General Göring's meeting with Mussolini. It is said that Italy is willing to cooperate with the European powers, but this cooperation must not include Soviet Russia. The conditions must be different from those of the past two years, as the Four-Power Pact is now a thing of the past, and the so-called Stresa Front has been shattered and can never be used again. (Reuters, 20th)

### President Roosevelt Continues to Seek Welfare for the Poor During His Second Term

He Braved Rain and Snow with the People at His Inaugural Speech; The Presidential Palace Only Served Tea and Snacks to Guests

[Washington] President Roosevelt solemnly declared today that the government will continue to seek improved living conditions for the more than 40 million underprivileged Americans, and then began his second term as president. When President Roosevelt delivered his speech, he stood bareheaded in the rain and snow. There was originally bulletproof glass protecting the platform, but Roosevelt ordered it to be removed, saying, "If everyone can brave this rain and snow, why can't I?" He was sworn in by Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court, and other judges were also present, but Stone was ill and Brandeis was too weak to attend. Before the president arrived, Mrs. Roosevelt, seeing that the judges were all elderly, ordered the White House attendants to bring in robes to keep them warm. The oath was taken at 12:29 p.m. According to the Constitution, the president must take office at noon, so today the United States had 29 minutes without a president in legal terms. When the president arrived, he originally rode in a sedan, but seeing the crowds standing in the rain, he returned to the White House and changed to an open car, so that his wife's new hat was also ruined by the rain and snow. Later, when the president reviewed the parade, he had already changed out of his wet clothes. (National Telegram, 20th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt was sworn in, delivered a speech, and attended two tea parties at the White House, and went to bed early tonight. Today, before the president held the inauguration ceremony, he invited more than 700 dignitaries from all walks of life to the White House for tea and snacks, which included cold meat sandwiches, ice cream, and coffee. After the army marched in the heavy rain through the streets and past the presidential platform, another 3,000 people went to the White House for tea and snacks. The president attended both tea parties for a short time, but Mrs. Roosevelt was very gracious in her hospitality. Although it rained heavily today, the president still held the oath ceremony in the open-air speech platform outside the Capitol, refusing to hold it inside the Capitol. The president pointed to the 50,000 people watching the ceremony outside the Capitol, soaked to the skin, and said, "They can endure the heavy rain, so can I." The president's mother and his sons and grandsons all attended the inauguration ceremony today. Four generations participating in the grand ceremony is the first time in American history. (Reuters, 20th)

[Washington] The political, financial, and commercial circles of the country all expect today that the natural result of President Roosevelt's inaugural speech is that the government will exert pressure to achieve administrative goals. Although the president did not vigorously attack speculation, the reflection on Wall Street was that all prices rose. However, there is no doubt that the president is determined to lead the government and promote the social and economic plan of the New Deal philosophy. (National Telegram, 20th)

Tianjin Power News: The conference of Japanese military attaches stationed in the provinces of North China is scheduled to be held in Tianjin on the 18th and 19th of this month.

On the 14th of this month, the Japanese General Staff Headquarters dispatched subordinate Watanabe Zokyo to Tianjin to convey the diplomatic intentions and the working principles that the heads of various special service agencies should abide by this year. The headquarters of the Japanese garrison in North China has not yet conveyed this to the heads of special service agencies in various places. At the same time, the Japanese military headquarters also believes that the drastic changes in the Shaanxi Incident necessitate new decisions and various diplomatic plans for the current situation. Therefore, the conference of military attaches was expanded and convened. In the past, military attaches from Peiping, Tongzhou, and Suiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Qingdao, and Jinan all rushed to Tianjin. The headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army also dispatched the third section chief Takeshita Yoshiharu and subordinate Fukuei Shinji to Tianjin on the evening of the 17th to attend the meeting. However, Takeshita went to Peiping via Tongzhou on the morning of the 18th to inspect the expansion of the puppet organization in eastern Hebei and was scheduled to return to Tianjin on the morning of the 19th to participate in the meeting again.

### Tragic Incident of a Passenger Train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Being Burned Midway

Seventy-six Passengers Burned to Death; Four Died from Falls and Twenty-seven Were Injured; All Three Third-Class Passenger Cars Were Completely Destroyed

Guangzhou Communication: The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway train runs several times a day, and the places it passes through are all prosperous towns in Dongjiang. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 16th of this month, an unprecedented tragic train burning incident occurred, burning 76 passengers to death and injuring more than 20 people, destroying three passenger cars and causing a loss of more than 200,000 yuan. The details are recorded as follows:

Horrific Fire Scene

On the 16th of this month, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway midday express train departed from Kowloon, Hong Kong, at 12:30 p.m. Because it was Saturday, many people from Hong Kong took the train to Guangzhou for sightseeing, and as the Lunar New Year was approaching, travel between Hong Kong and Guangdong was frequent, so the number of passengers on that day was more crowded than usual. The train consisted of ten cars, including first-class, second-class, and third-class cars. The five third-class passenger cars were closest to the engine, followed by two second-class passenger cars, and the two first-class passenger cars were at the rear. There were no fewer than four or five hundred passengers in each car, and the third-class cars had the most passengers. After the train departed from Kowloon, it stopped briefly at the Shilong station in the Huaxian section at 3 p.m. and then departed again. Less than ten minutes after the train started, a ball of white smoke was suddenly found near the toilet in the third third-class passenger car in the front, and it scattered with the wind. Before long, flames shot out from the thick smoke, and the car was already on fire. According to eyewitnesses, the fire started in a basket of chemical plastic toys weighing about 40 kilograms. At that time, the smell of smoke was pungent and unapproachable. Another theory is that smugglers were secretly transporting explosive items (such as silver powder and white medicine), which caught fire due to impact from the movement of the car. (Note: The two theories have not yet been determined, and the authorities are still investigating. This is because most of the victims in the car at that time were killed, and the injured may not have been eyewitnesses.) After the third car in the front caught fire, the engine was moving forward and it was not easy to detect, so the fire took advantage of the wind and spread to the second and fourth passenger cars adjacent to the third car. The male and female passengers in the three cars had no way to escape, regardless of the chain of burning ships, and the engine at the front was still running with the wind. The passengers in the three cars were at a loss, and when they were exhausted, the fire was already imminent, so they died together. Some jumped out of the car windows to escape, but the engine still did not stop, and they broke their heads and limbs as soon as they jumped down. It was better to die by jumping out of the car, and there was no hope of survival if they did not escape. The cruelty was beyond description. In the blink of an eye, the engine passed the bend, and the driver looked back at the passenger cars and saw thick smoke coming out. At the same time, the road staff also warned with flags, and then the car stopped abruptly, but the three passenger cars had been reduced to ashes. The passengers in the neighboring car could only hear the miserable cries, but the train stopped in the wilderness below Shilihua station, with no one around, and there was no way to find rescue personnel. The stationmaster of Shilihua station, a man named Mai, urgently telegraphed the Shilong station and the Guangzhou Dashatou Railway Bureau, asking them to quickly send a rescue team to rescue the dead and injured.

Collecting Corpses and Rescuing the Injured

After hearing the news, the Railway Bureau immediately sent the head of the Transportation Section, the head of the Medical Department, and other staff members, along with more than ten members of the Guangfang Bianyi Hospital rescue team, to the scene of the accident by special train to rescue. First, they rescued and treated more than 20 passengers who were burned, and transported the burned vehicles back to Shilong to facilitate the resumption of traffic on the railway tracks. It was not until about 9 p.m. on the evening of the 16th that the injured were transported back to Guangzhou and sent to Bianyi Hospital, the Municipal Hospital, and Liangguang Hospital for treatment. A total of 27 men and women were admitted to the hospital. In addition, Zhang Mingjun, Guan Ba, Kong Youqiu, Kong Youxian, Chen Yuan, Guan Ba, Huang Li, and seven others were treated and discharged home because their injuries were not serious. Among the remaining 27 people, Zhang Yao died in the hospital the next day due to serious injuries. The Bianyi Hospital corpse collection team went to the scene of the accident again by special list on the morning of the 17th to collect corpses from the burned cars. Most of the corpses were cremated, leaving only skull heads or incomplete limbs, or only a bundle of withered bones. In fact, the corpses were no longer identifiable. The parties collected them, photographed the skeletal bones, and attached the deceased's belongings. A total of 72 remains were collected, and a pile of other mixed bones, amounting to several people. In addition, two male corpses and two female corpses were found by the roadside, who died from jumping out of the car. Only these four corpses were complete, and they were immediately wrapped in mats and transported to the province by car, unloaded near the stadium above Taishatou Station, and then transported by freight car to the Gao Gang beside Bianyi Hospital on Changgeng Road, where the hospital officially announced that there were 76 male and female corpses, inviting relatives to identify them.

Investigation of the Injured

Those sent to Guangzhou and hospitalized in Guanghua Hospital include Xie Baohua from Longchuan County, Li Youqing from Nanhai, Yang Chuang from Zhongshan, Zhang Yao from Zhongshan (died on the 17th), Cen Lianhao (female) from Baoan County, Yang Qihong from Xinhui, Zhou Mingyou from Gaoyao, Yuan Mankai from Zhongshan, an unnamed person (male) who has died of serious injuries, Chen Ye from Sanshui, Guo Zhong from Zengcheng, Chen Yuan from Nanhai, Guan Ba from Nanhai, Kong Boqiu from Nanhai, Kong Zhaoguang from Nanhai, Zhang Mingjun from Nanhai, and Huang Li from Panyu. Those hospitalized in the Municipal Hospital include Feng Yixiong from Zhongshan. Those hospitalized in Boji Hospital include Zhang Cai from Huizhou, Tan Guoguang from Dongguan, and Lin Jun from Xinhui. Those hospitalized in Liangguang Baptist Hospital include Zheng Shuying (female) from Zhongshan and Zuo Ju from Shunde. Those hospitalized in Bianyi Hospital include Li Yan from Heshan (a partner in the express train's fruit department), Yan Guanting from Shunde, and Liu Sen from Nanhai.

Aftermath News

① The above corpses were burned to charcoal, with incomplete limbs and unrecognizable faces. Even if there are relatives of the corpses to claim them, it is impossible to identify them. Only seven were claimed on the 18th, and the rest could not be claimed. Therefore, the parties plan to build a public cemetery for mass burial, recording the cause of the incident, so that the relatives of the missing can pay their respects. ② The Railway Bureau, because the cause of the fire is uncertain, initiated the organization of an inquiry committee, and designated the Chinese and British directors of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau, the heads of the Transportation Department, the heads of the Road Maintenance Department, the heads of the Mechanical Department, and the general section chiefs to study the cause of the accident. ③ After the tragic incident occurred, the Railway Bureau has purchased dozens of coffins and entrusted Bianyi Hospital to bury the corpses that have not been claimed first, to avoid prolonged exposure. ④ For the sake of the aftermath, the Railway Bureau ordered that fire extinguishers and fire-fighting equipment be added to the cars in the future, and that passenger quotas be restricted and smuggling be strictly cracked down on.

Summary of Losses

The property lost by the victims this time is estimated at more than 10,000 yuan. One debt collector was said to have had more than 20,000 yuan in Hong Kong currency in his pocket, which was also burned. There was also a family of eight who came to the province in the same car. Only one child survived, and the other seven were buried in the fire pit. Three third-class passenger cars were destroyed, each worth about 30,000 yuan, and the Railway Bureau lost a total of 100,000 yuan. In addition, the railway tracks were destroyed by the fire, causing a loss of about 1,000 yuan. Fortunately, the railway tracks were not seriously damaged. After slight repairs, the trains on the 18th operated normally without obstruction. The income of the Railway Bureau was not greatly affected. (January 19th)

### Total Value of Seasonal Fruit Production in Fujian Province Last Year

Olives and Fortune Oranges Account for the Majority; Export Value Totals More Than One Million

Fuzhou Communication: Fuzhou's seasonal fruit production is dominated by olives and fortune oranges. Olive species are further divided into two types: one is Sandalwood, which is small in size and fragrant, and has a higher value; the other is Changying, which is round and large, and can be used for pickling and soaking in honey. It is transported from Fujian to various ports in Shanghai and Tianjin, and the sales are very large. The annual sales amount is about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Since the Guangdong Army returned to Guangzhou from Fujian in the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), they brought olive seeds from Fujian to Guangdong to plant, and now there is production. Taiwan also has Fujian species, and exports have been made in recent years, but the quality is not as good as that produced in Fujian Province. Last year, the olives in Fujian Province fell due to the wind, and production decreased. Exports were only more than 30,000 parts, worth more than 300,000 yuan, a decrease of half compared to the past. Fortune oranges are well-known in Shanghai, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other ports, and are important goods for winter sales. The annual production is more than one million yuan. Last year's production was very strong, and the weather in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places was also very sunny, and sales were very good. However, the selling price could not improve, and it was difficult for operators to profit. More than 5,000 pieces have been exported last year, and they are still being exported one after another. By the end of the season, the combined amount can reach more than 10,000 pieces. After this, the Guang oranges produced in Chaozhou and Shantou have already fallen out of season, and the selling price of fortune oranges is expected to increase slightly.

### Corpses and Coffins Robbed by Bandits in Songjiang

In Taipingfang, Fengjing Town, at the Shen Si Yi Hall, there was a deceased Sun woman who had passed away for more than ten years. At the time of her elaborate funeral, gold, silver, and jewelry were all hidden inside the coffin, which was widely talked about among the townspeople. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 7th, during heavy snowfall, bandits learned that the Sun family's coffin was stored in the North Gate mortuary. They broke into the mortuary, which housed four coffins in total. The bandits only broke open the Sun family's coffin and stole one gold scepter, one silver teapot, one silver cup, and jewelry ornaments. The corpses were left in a messy state. The bandits fled with the stolen goods. The mortuary manager immediately reported the incident to the Second Sub-bureau for investigation and prosecution.

### Qian Dajun of Kunshan Returns Home to Recuperate

### A Post and Telegraph Office Established at Twelve Forts in Changshu

Twelve Forts Port in Shazhou City, in this county, borders the Yangtze River and is adjacent to Nantong. It is also one of the most remote major towns in the county's jurisdiction. However, due to transportation issues, travel to and from there is particularly inconvenient. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation specially added a post and telegraph office and a long-distance telephone bureau there. Because there are ferries passing through the area every day and there are many passengers, the installation of telephone poles at the bureau is nearly complete. It is scheduled to officially open on February 1st, making transportation in that area more convenient from now on.

### Accusation Against the Director of the Land Administration Bureau in Suzhou

Qiu Zixian and others, members of the Wu County party, stated that Chen Shufeng, a resident of Yinma Town in the urban area, submitted several real estate deeds to the Wu County Land Administration Bureau for registration in September of last year. On the 8th of this month, Chen presented the receipt to the Land Administration Bureau to retrieve the deeds. The bureau claimed that they had been fraudulently claimed by someone on the 5th, and the fraudulent receipt was stamped with the bureau's seal and the registration office's small seal. Chen immediately hired lawyer Cai Chenglu to send a letter to the Land Administration Bureau, requesting a reply within three days, but it was ignored. Subsequently, a warning letter was also ignored. Now, legal solutions are being prepared. Such a situation is inevitably detrimental to the property rights of the people. Therefore, on the 21st, they jointly submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau, requesting the removal and punishment of the bureau director, Dong Zhongsheng, the urban area registration director, Sun Qi, and the document custodian, Wei, in order to maintain official integrity.

Managing the Temple Property of Lianchi Nunnery

Lianchi Nunnery on Wufeng Mountain in Mu'du Township is one of the ancient temples in Wu County. The temple is quite popular with pilgrims. Because the abbot of the nunnery, Kuanlu, did not abide by the monastic rules, the county government ordered his expulsion. Afterwards, many people recommended successors to the government. County Magistrate Deng found it difficult to handle, so he requested local figures, such as Li Yinquan, to organize a management committee for the temple property and have the committee select the abbot. The committee has already decided to rotate the management among five people: Pukai from Tianchi Mountain Jiji Nunnery, Miaozhen from Lingyan Mountain Chongbao Nunnery, and others, with each rotation lasting one year. Previously, Yang Zengxiang and others had submitted a petition to the county government to recommend Yinhuai as the abbot of the nunnery, but the county government disapproved it on the 21st.

### Telegraph to the Province from Wuxi Regarding the Handling of Major Bandits

Duan Qishan, the captain of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau of this county, led detectives on the 14th of this month and arrested six major bandits from the Su gang, including Cai Youxiang, Fei Jingen, Zhou Jinsheng, Zhou Fuchu, Zhou Tangshi, and Zhou Lushi, at No. 30 Ying'anli, Yinglong Town, outside the West Gate. After bringing them back to the bureau, they were strictly interrogated. Cai confessed to robbing the Zhang Miao's house, Huang Xincai's house, and a certain family in Lingyan Mountain, Suzhou, without denial. Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau considered that these criminals had repeatedly committed armed robberies in the villages of Suzhou and Wuxi, showing utter disregard for the law. It was decided on the 22nd to transfer them to the county government for review and handling. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the provincial authorities, requesting that they be dealt with according to the law and requesting the authorities to cooperate in arresting the fugitives, bringing them to justice for interrogation.

Completing the Tax Collection Door-to-Door

The county government of this county began collecting the second installment of the 25th year's land tax as early as December 1st. Initially, very few businesses came to the counter to pay. With only nine days left until the initial deadline, County Magistrate Long issued a handwritten order to all tax collectors and Tu Zheng (local officials) to diligently complete the collection. On the 20th and 21st, the collection amount increased slightly, with more than 10,000 yuan collected each day. The tax quota for this year is 60%, approximately 600,000 yuan. More than 100,000 yuan has already been collected. How can the full amount be collected within this initial deadline? It is because the Yitu (community map) of this county has already been completed, with a total of more than 140 Yitu established. Each Yitu is responsible for door-to-door collection by the Jia Zhu (heads of the villages), sweeping away the amount in one go.

### Three Cars Fall into the River in Haizhou

At 11 AM on the 18th, a chartered bus from United Motors was returning from Yangji to Guanyun County. When it passed the Shanhou River, the car had just driven onto the ferry when, due to the slippery gangplank after the snow, it plunged into the center of the river, sinking into the mud. Only a foot or so of the car's hood was visible above the water. For the price of 20 yuan, four cows were hired to pull the car up. At 3 PM that afternoon, a chartered bus from Lianyungang Motor Company was coming from Xiangshui Port and also had to cross the river. The car had already boarded the ferry, and when it was ferrying to the north bank, the car drove towards the dock and also slid into the river due to the slippery mud. The company used a large truck, tied with ropes, and invited more than 40 villagers to help push and pull, finally dragging the car up. At 5 PM in the evening, another chartered bus from Public Welfare Motors came from Yangji and passed the ferry crossing of the river. Again, due to the slippery mud on the dock, it plunged into the river. It cost ten yuan to hire six cows from farmers to drag the car ashore. One of the car wheels was damaged.

### Yangzhou Boat Association Requests to Establish an Office

The Huo Jia Bridge Ferry in the Second District of Jiangdu often has disputes over the loading and unloading of goods and dock workers. The Datong and Dada companies do not have anyone stationed at the port to be responsible for the delivery. The Sucheng County Civilian Boat Industry Workers' Union, recognizing that these companies have no one responsible and that there are disputes over the handling of goods, has established an office in Huoqiao to specifically handle the delivery of goods. On the 19th, they submitted a petition to the Jiangdu County Government, stating the reasons and requesting to be put on file.

### Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce Organizes Training Classes

### All Blacks Lost to Xin Team Yesterday

60 to 43; First Half 34 to 8

There were a total of three basketball matches at Shen Garden yesterday. The first was between Mailing B of Group A Section B against Liangxi. Mailing was initially very aggressive, leading by as many as 20 points in the first half with a score of 27 to 17. In the second half, Liangxi chased hard, while Mailing seemed discouraged, missing all free throws. As a result, Liangxi scored one point more than Mailing at the end, with a score of 10 to 9. However, due to the large deficit in the first half, Liangxi ultimately lost to Mailing by 36 to 17. The second match was between Jingwu and Fuzhong of Group B Section II. Fuzhong was in poor condition after taking the court and was no match for Jingwu's skillful play, falling behind 9 to 15 in the first half. During the break, Fuzhong's coach, Mr. Han Kuiyong, came to the court despite being ill to provide guidance. Indeed, his advice worked wonders, and after the restart, Fuzhong looked completely renewed. The score also rose rapidly, increasing by eight points in one breath, surpassing Jingwu by 17 to 15. Jingwu repeatedly attempted to catch up, making the situation even more tense. However, after a distant shot, Fuzhong ultimately prevailed with wisdom, reversing the loss by 33 to 24. The last match was between the Xin team and the All Blacks of Group A Section A. Both sides belonged to the same group, showing great politeness during the match. After the exchange, the Xin team first scored. Lu Zhongen missed his shot, but Feng Nianhua made both free throws, scoring four points. Chen Xianglong made two layups, and Lu Zhongen also made one, increasing the score to 10 to 0. The All Blacks missed many shots and appeared flustered. It was not until Xu Jusheng made a layup under the basket that they opened the score. However, the Xin team's Feng Nianhua and Qian Jingyong added three more baskets, and Yuan Shangrang broke the basket, making it 4 to 16. But Qian Jingyong retaliated in the same way. Zhang Shaoqing made a free throw, and Lu Zhongyu and Chen Xianglong also scored continuously, making it 22 to 5, further widening the gap. Before long, the All Blacks' Xu Jusheng and Zhang Shaoqing made one free throw and one field goal, adding three points. But the Xin team's shots were like a string of beads, reaching 34 to 8 in an instant. The first half ended there. After the break, the Xin team replaced Qian Jingyong with Sun Huimin, but soon Qian returned to the court, replacing Lu Zhongyu. The momentum of the All Blacks increased, and Xu Jusheng scored two baskets. Gu Shangrang also made two free throws, adding six points in one breath, reducing the score to 14 to 34. The difference was now only half. After Chen Xianglong made a basket, Jia Youliang and Xu Xilin made two more major contributions, making it 18 to 36, with the difference now only four points. Compared to 34 to 8 in the first half, the situation was completely different. Later, the Xin team's momentum became active again. After Xianglong and Shaoqing each made a basket, Chen added two more, and Jia Youliang scored, making it 57 to 37. The Xin team suddenly took the lead by 20 points again. Later, the All Blacks' Xu and Zhang rallied, and the Xin team also scored slightly. Until Qian Jingyong made a free throw, it ended with a score of 60 to 43. The Xin team ultimately won due to their lead in the first half. Therefore, although the second half ended with a score of 26 to 35, with the All Blacks surpassing them, they still won the victory. The results of each match are as follows:

Mailing B defeated Liangxi (A B) 36 to 17
Fuzhong defeated Jingwu (B II) 33 to 24
Xin Team defeated All Blacks (A A) 60 to 43

At the end of the first half, the referee team was behind with a score of 21 to 18. In the third quarter, the referee team once surpassed the lead with a score of 36 to 32. Not long after the start of the fourth quarter, Li Feiyun withdrew due to an eye injury. However, each member had duties last night, so only five people arrived, leaving them with no substitutes to fight with four people.

### Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Improves Overseas Chinese School Subjects

(Nanjing, 21st) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believes that the curricula of overseas Chinese schools are inconsistent. For example, in overseas Chinese schools in the Philippines, Chinese is taught in the morning and English in the afternoon. The same course is taught in both Chinese and English, which is very inappropriate. In the Dutch East Indies, Dutch laws and regulations are used, and the Malay language is used for trade and communication between various ethnic groups. However, while overseas Chinese schools have a foreign language subject, they only teach English and completely ignore Dutch and Malay. This is impractical and incomprehensible. The Commission has instructed all consulates to instruct their affiliated overseas Chinese schools to make practical improvements and formulate teaching subjects for overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools, taking into account the revised primary and secondary school curriculum tables of the Ministry of Education and the actual needs of various overseas Chinese communities.

### Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Investigates and Compiles Statistics on Private Schools Throughout the City

There are a total of 452 private schools in the urban area, and teachers will be trained after registration.

(Note) The Pusan District has not yet been surveyed. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to rectify and improve the private schools in this city, launched a general survey of private schools throughout the city starting on the 23rd of last month and began a general registration of private school teachers throughout the city starting on the 20th of this month. The results of the survey and the rectification plan are recorded as follows:

General Situation: The survey only covered the urban area, and the result was a total of 452 private schools. Each school has only one teacher, so the number is also 452. Men account for the vast majority, with only six female teachers. Among the male teachers, those from Jiangbei account for the majority. Most of them are over 40 years old. There are more than 10,000 students in total, with the Zhabei District having the most. The schools are mostly located in straw sheds, with no equipment other than tables and chairs. The school year is different from ordinary schools. It is divided into three terms based on the lunar calendar: New Year to Dragon Boat Festival is the first term, Dragon Boat Festival to Mid-Autumn Festival is the second term, and Mid-Autumn Festival to the end of the year is the third term. The tuition fee is at most seven yuan per student per term and at least one yuan. The average is two or three yuan. The highest income is 600 yuan per school per year (excluding tutors). The curriculum focuses on Chinese language, calligraphy, and abacus calculation. The Analects of Confucius, Mencius, and the Four Books and Five Classics are everywhere. Classes are quite casual. Students can freely enter and leave during class time. Clothes do not need to be neat, and tuition fees can be paid in installments, so most parents are willing to send their children to private schools. Most of the teachers are from private school backgrounds, and few have graduated from schools.

Registration Begins: The Social Affairs Bureau believes that private schools are so corrupt as a result of the survey, so it immediately organized a general registration of private school teachers in order to gradually improve the situation. Registration started on the 20th. Registrants must bring two two-and-a-half-inch half-length photos, go to the bureau in person to fill out the registration form, and take an oral test. The registration has been very enthusiastic in the past two days and will end on February 10th. After the registration is completed, a training center for private school teachers will be established to seek thorough rectification.

### Liu Haisu Requests Allocation of Boxer Indemnity Funds to Promote Art

In the past, the use of the interest from the British-returned Boxer Indemnity funds has mostly focused on the encouragement of science, and little attention has been paid to art. When Mr. Liu Haisu exhibited his paintings in the UK, he discussed the issue of Sino-British cultural exchange with prominent figures in the British art world such as Laurence Binyon, Roth, and Yeats. Both sides believed that it was necessary to seek progress urgently. Therefore, after Liu returned to China, he repeatedly consulted with the persons in charge of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee, advocating that the use of the interest in the future should also focus on the encouragement of art and learning. Now that the meeting of the committee is approaching, he has sent another letter suggesting this.

### Yarn and Cotton

The bulls are making a comeback to maintain the recent rise in cotton yarn prices.

The forward prices have also been pulled up a lot. However, the current selling prices of yarn are falling one after another.

The yarn market was sluggish in the morning but rose in the afternoon, and the momentum turned strong. This is because the delivery period for this month is approaching, and it is rumored that there are 3,000 to 5,000 bales for delivery. However, the buyers are also strong and are prepared to collect as much as possible. At the same time, the absorption of the February contract has not been abandoned. The near-term prices are rising, and the far-term prices are soaring. However, the current yarn trading is very depressed. The total transaction volume for the whole day is less than 300 bales, and the selling prices are falling one after another.

Large February yarn buyers continue to drag. In the opening market for standard yarn, the rise in Osaka Sampin yarn continued, and the popularity was average. The prices for all months rose by 1.2 cents. However, the buying momentum in the market was weak. Only large February buyers continued to drag in. After the second session, it was heard that the spot yarn market was sluggish and the market price was falling frequently, which affected people's hearts. The prices for all months tended to go downstream again. As a result, the February contract rose by 0.2 cents compared to the previous day's closing price, while the others all fell by 2, 7, and 9 cents. After the afternoon opening, the price for the current month suddenly rose by 1.4 yuan. It was rumored that the buyers were collecting a large amount of goods and were determined not to let go of the December contract, so people's hearts were turbulent. The far-term prices were slow, and the prices on the table became tighter and tighter. However, the current yarn trading was very weak. The rising momentum was even stronger at the closing time. As a result, the prices for all months rose by 1.8, 9 cents to 2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that the sales were 1,150 bales of Deda, 1,250 bales of Dafu, 1,300 bales of Yuda, 800 bales of Dafeng, 2,650 bales of Mingde, 1,550 bales of Fengtai, 2,000 bales of Renfeng, 2,050 bales of Fukang, 800 bales of Xincheng, 1,250 bales of Yichang, and 800 bales of Shengyuan. The purchases were 5,000 bales of Gengfeng, 1,300 bales of Hengyi, 1,000 bales of Zhenda, 1,850 bales of Taichang, 2,000 bales of Changfeng, 950 bales of Xiecheng, 1,200 bales of Dachangcheng, 750 bales of Yongda, 600 bales of Changyu, 500 bales of Juxing, 500 bales of Yukang, and 500 bales of Jifeng. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

Yarn sales are less than 300 bales. The current yarn sales are very sluggish. It was found that the total amount bought by various gangs for the whole day was only 297 bales, and the selling price fell by 2-3 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below: Wuhu 5, Henan 25, Peers 10, Inland 33, Anqing 10, Guangdong 5, Xuzhou 20, Total 297.

Production prices are not relaxed, and cotton hedge sales are gradually lacking.

The cotton market started to fall and then rose, and the market situation turned for the better. However, overseas American and Indian cotton are still in a sluggish state, and factory demand is not smooth. Most of them are bearish. In fact, the standard yarn is rebounding, and the selling price in the area is tightened and not relaxed, so hedge sellers feel a lack.

Standard cotton rebounded by 0.2-0.3 yuan. In the opening market for standard cotton, the selling momentum was strong due to the decline in the overseas Indian and American cotton markets and the sluggish yarn market. The prices for all months fell by 0.05-0.1 yuan. There was still a lack of upward momentum in the second session. By the time of closing, the market conditions were slightly higher as Sampin cotton's telegram showed that the far-term prices continued to rise by 1 yuan. As a result, the prices for all months still fell by 0.05-0.12 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, except for the April contract, which rose by 0.05 yuan. After the afternoon opening, the prices rose along with the yarn market, and the momentum was tight. There were not many sellers in the market. The prices continued to rise after the second session. As a result, the prices for all months rose by 0.15-0.45 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that the sales were 3,500 dans of Yuda, 1,000 dans of Jifeng, 1,000 dans of Mingde, 2,400 dans of Gengfeng, 3,600 dans of Dachangcheng, 1,200 dans of Yichang, 3,600 dans of Tonghe, 3,400 dans of Xinhua, 1,100 dans of Minghua, 1,600 dans of Taichang, 1,900 dans of Changfeng, 1 dan of Jinghua, 2,900 dans of Xincheng, and 1,400 dans of Yikang. The purchases were 6,000 dans of Hengyi, 1,000 dans of Dafeng, 3,000 dans of RunKang, 1,100 dans of Shengyuan, 1,600 dans of Xinchang, 2,800 dans of Taixing, 2,100 dans of Yuanyi, and 2,800 dans of Fukang. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

The current cotton sales are still mediocre. The current cotton factory operations are not smooth. The source is 1,260 bales of Yaohua, 1,118 bales of Tonghua, and 6,600 of Lingbaohua. Shenxin Factory imported 332 pieces of spot goods. Hankouhua 50.00. Yongan Factory imported 200 pieces. Also, Wutong Factory imported 105 pieces at 50.21. Also, 217 pieces.

American cotton closing market atmosphere revived

Yesterday's opening of American cotton trading was still active. However, due to poor Liverpool telegrams, continued heavy auto industry labor strikes, and unfavorable Japanese financial conditions, the prices for all months fell by 1-9 points. Then, due to buying by peers, part of it reacted, and finally ended with a bull market revival. The cooperative and Western gang sold, and the market conditions were tired again. Before the closing, the stock market was strong, and President Roosevelt's inaugural speech, coupled with peer buying in the near month, improved the market price again. The closing was firm, with the spot price falling by 6 points and the futures price rising by 1 point to falling by 3 points. British cotton spot fell by 6 points, and futures fell by 2-4 points. Indian cotton was initially tired due to the settlement of old bulls, but then improved due to purchases by European exporters and the lack of hedge sales. The prices recovered. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 0.5-1 rupee, Aomula fell by 0.25-1.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (20th telegram).

According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 21st was: Bailuoxi was 227.5 rupees, Aomula was 205 rupees, up 1.25 rupees, and Pingguoer was 179.5 rupees, up 1.5 rupees.

Attached American cotton private estimate

New York, 20th. The Chicago Shields Company predicts that the number of ginned bales for this season will be 11,927,000.

Tianjin Cotton Merchants' Business Has Repeated Setbacks

In the Tianjin cotton market last year (1936), fine lint cotton surpassed coarse lint cotton. The number of Shanghai and Japanese merchants stationed in Tianjin to collect goods increased by five. However, due to the sharp market conditions and the high base price, cotton merchants were often in danger. During the first half of the year, the maximum price of fine lint was 62 yuan, and the maximum price in the second half of the year was only 60 yuan. Coarse lint increased to 48 yuan in the first half of the year and rose to 49 yuan during the late July and early August period when there was a shortage, so cotton merchants made a maximum profit of 5-6 yuan per bale. When new cotton was listed, the opening price of 45.5 yuan gradually fluctuated, and the price only returned to 47.5-48 yuan at the end of the year. Cotton merchants suffered repeated setbacks in the middle and had little hope of making a profit. Most of them maintained a draw. Cotton warehouses earned a fixed income and made a profit of 45,000-120,000 yuan due to the increase in trade this year.

Dyed Blank Cloth Sales Particularly High

Discounted Sale of "Luo Ling" Twill Velvet

Yesterday, the listed yarn price rose by two yuan, but the actual yarn price continued its sharp decline. The cloth market was affected and remained sluggish. Japanese and other foreign firms' white goods orders were few. Businesses from Tianjin and some local firms tended to sell, further pressuring the market. Among Eastern-produced white goods, fine twill was the weakest, continuing to drop by (per bolt) five cents. Fine cloth remained firm, rebounding slightly by two and a half cents. Gray cloth and coarse cloth were both firm. Transactions were mainly with dyeing factories and wholesale departments on this street, with dyed cloth and blank cloth accounting for the majority. This is because, according to usual practice, dyeing workshops stop work after the 20th day of the twelfth lunar month. Therefore, they must rush to dye cloth at this time to prepare for the spring market. Therefore, the daily transactions of fine cloth in the market are still considerable. The white goods from this factory are also weakest in fine cloth and fine twill, with sluggish customer sales. The dyeing factories on this street have limited capacity, and prices fell by five cents to ten cents. Coarse cloth and coarse twill, due to shallow inventory, saw a stable market. "Luo Ling" twill velvet continued to be sold at discounted prices yesterday. "Qing Feng" 16-pound double fish "Ji Qing" fell below eleven yuan, matching the opening price at the end of September, a drop of more than four yuan compared to the peak of fifteen yuan in November. Customer orders from Qingdao, Jinan, Luoyang, Xuzhou, for printed goods, floral cloth, satin, and "Zhi Gong" were still good. Sichuanese businesses continued to handle blue cloth, gray cloth, twill, and other items.

"Yuan Fang" Silk Fabrics: More Declines than Rises

Yesterday, Thursday, was the day of the 3024th auction by "Yuan Fang" Foreign Firm in this port. Due to the Lunar New Year, the usual practice of postponing was followed, granting a six-week grace period for cash payment. On display were five types of goods: Western Satin, "Yuan" Velvet, "Zhi Gong" Wool Fabric, Silk Fabrics, and Foreign Red Cloth, totaling 46 brands and 66 boxes. The opening bid for Western Satin (5 brands) was lower per yard than the previous period, down by five and twenty-five hundredths of a cent. "Yuan" Velvet (2 brands) fell by four to seven cents. Wool fabrics remained largely unchanged. Silk fabrics (57 brands) also saw a drop in piece prices. "Bo Zi Tu," "Yan Guo Gong," and "Cai Ba Shi" (3 brands) fell by eighty or ninety cents. "Er Mei Luan Feng," "Wu Xing," "Hai Niu," and "Die Xian" fell by about half a yuan. Most of the others fell by twenty or thirty cents. "Hua Zhu," "Zhu Lin," and "Ren Qiu" (3 brands) rose by about ten cents. The called price for light-weight Foreign Red Cloth was weak.

Reduced Sales of Heavy Woolen Fabrics

Yesterday, sales of woolen fabrics gradually decreased due to weather and environmental factors. Except for various local businesses that are constantly restocking heavy winter goods, there were no other transactions. Most of the price increases had subsided. However, direct orders from foreign firms remained brisk, and quoted prices were mostly higher. The prices at the public market were largely firm on the surface but subtly flat. Sellers of heavy woolen fabrics were willing to reduce prices to sell.

Flour Prices Rebound

Wheat Prices Lead the Way

After the market opened yesterday morning, flour prices for all months rebounded quickly. As for imported wheat prices, the Chicago wheat market opened very strong, but foreign markets weakened due to profit-taking, resulting in mixed market performance. Closing prices ranged from a decrease of 6.25 to an increase of 3.75, equivalent to a decrease of nearly four cents and an increase of eight cents to two dimes in national currency for near and far months respectively. Canadian wheat fell by eight cents to twelve cents. Although imported wheat saw only a small rise, the sharp decline since the previous week was unexpected. Therefore, the views of bulls and bears gradually approached each other. Bulls have not smoothly reduced their positions, while bears are considering covering, resulting in the opening price rising step by step, up about three cents. By the time the afternoon session opened, the price for the current month stabilized due to slight buying by customers. Due to limited output from factories, shorts gradually covered positions for further months. Therefore, asking prices increased step by step. This situation was partly a rebound from the sharp decline and partly due to renewed confidence among outsiders, so the rebound was three, five, or six cents. If actual sales move forward, the market can temporarily stabilize.

The wheat market opened quietly in the morning but rebounded later. Imported wheat prices remained slightly lower, so trading in various months remained sluggish. However, due to relatively scarce output, prices for February, March, and April were slightly better by two or three cents. There was no opening price for the current month, and no change for June. By the time the afternoon session opened, the sharp rebound in flour prices caused uniform optimism among industry insiders, rebounding by eight cents to twelve cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. However, the future situation still depends on flour sales, which will determine market stability. In the current wheat market, prices fluctuate unpredictably, and factories and merchants have failed to reach an agreement, so there were no formal transactions.

Guangdong Merchants Take Advantage of Low Prices to Purchase Customer "Xian" Rice

Yesterday, the market situation for customer "xian" rice was lively, as Guangdong merchants continued to actively purchase. Although Guangdong Province has temporarily approved a foreign rice tax, current Shanghai market prices are low, making it a good opportunity to actively purchase. Yesterday, more than 10,000 bags of Hankou brown rice and 4,000 to 5,000 bags of machine-milled rice were purchased. Sales of brown rice to Guangdong were the strongest, but stocks did not appear large, so the market was raised by five or six cents. Due to abundant stocks and the year-end closing, millers and merchants were eager to sell machine-milled rice, so trading was active, but machine-milled rice was weak, down by three to five cents. Throughout the day, more than 11,300 bags of Jiangxi rice, 807 bags of Hunan rice, 10,000 bags of Hankou brown rice, 4,150 bags of Wen Yong rice, and 100 bags of Xiaojiao rice were sold, mostly purchased by Guangdong merchants, followed by a small amount for local oil shops, etc., for minimal needs.

Difficult to Develop the "He Xia" Rice Market

("Sa Bei") Yesterday, shipments from more than 30 sources in "He Xia" saw weak sales in the market. The price of high-quality white "geng" rice was flat and weak. Early in the morning, merchants wanted to raise prices for medium-quality rice, but due to weak sales, prices softened again. Early "Bo Dao" rice was firm, and white "Yuan" rice was popular, and prices turned weak, and the price of hidden "Yin Yuan" was still strong. The prices of other goods were stable.

("Hu Nan") Yesterday, shipments from more than 60 sources totaled 12,500 to 12,600 "shi," including shipments of "Bo Dao" from more than 30 sources. The market situation remained weak. Qingdao merchants purchased over 1,000 bags of "Bo Dao." The price of high-quality goods remained flat due to limited supply, while medium-quality goods fell by nearly one cent. After consecutive days of price declines, "Hou Geng" rice saw slight demand from shops, and the market situation stabilized. However, considering the overall situation, it seems difficult for the market to improve as the Lunar New Year approaches. "Du Yang Jian" and hidden "Yin Bian Yuan" rice saw similar performance to "Geng" rice, but "Nan Gang" early rice was slightly lower due to its higher price.

Soybeans and Sesame Support a Stable Situation

Yesterday, the price of foreign sesame seeds remained at 15.15 yuan and 15.10 yuan, with 500 tons transacted. Although current sentiment is weak, there is still demand, so the overall situation can be supported. The same is true for soybeans. As bean cake sales continue steadily, only the transaction volume fluctuates slightly, and prices remain stable. Soybean owners are unwilling to sell easily. Only a few businesses preparing to close down are slightly accommodating. Yesterday, oil mills purchased three truckloads of Bengbu soybeans. Local and Guangdong merchants transacted 400-500 bags of Northeast soybeans and 400 bags of "Du Dou Sha Huang." Merchants from Fuzhou, Tongzhou, the mainland, and local merchants purchased a total of more than 2,000 bags of Hankou "Chi Zha" soybeans.

New York Futures Silk Rebounds, But White Filature Merchants' Acceptable Prices Still Not Met

Yesterday, overseas silk prices rebounded. New York futures rose by two points for the near term and three points for the far term. Yokohama spot prices rose by 20 yuan, and far-term prices rose by 20 yuan. Therefore, American merchants telegraphed, offering 825 yuan for White Filature B-grade 7/8 evenness RR, an increase of ten yuan from the previous day. However, this price is still about ten yuan lower than the price held by Chinese merchants, resulting in few transactions. Yesterday, only "Da Chang Lian" purchased dozens of bales of high-grade White Filature. Only Indian merchants made sporadic purchases. Yesterday, a total of 70 bales were transacted.

British Tea Slow Sales, Price Decreases

England is a major distribution center for black tea, and its performance has a significant impact. According to recent news, sales of tea in London remain sluggish. British and Indian tea merchants, who rely on large re-export business after the New Year, have seen a sharp decline in sales due to the unfavorable European environment and the economic exhaustion of various countries. Even China's Qimen black tea, due to the market downturn, is not selling well at prices above 150 yuan, and prices are gradually falling. The most sluggish sales are for flower-scented tea and broken leaves. Merchants are reducing prices to sell, resulting in the greatest losses. According to observations by tea merchants, the future pricing of Qimen tea will inevitably be lower than in previous years.

India has also made some purchases, but buying interest is limited. The need to bring forward silver shipments has now been met, and the market is trending towards dullness, but resistance will occur after further price declines.

Factory Produced Round Nails, "Bei Si," Rise Another Yuan

Factory produced round nails rose another yuan yesterday. The price of each barrel of "Bei Si" was 12 yuan. However, factory production was extremely low due to a shortage of raw materials. The price of round nail raw materials was set at 5 pounds per ton. It has recently soared to around 10 pounds, but there has not yet been a shipment to Shanghai. In terms of sales, there have been no new shipments for a long time, and there are many buyers, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand and a strong market. Only 300-400 barrels were produced.

Hui Si Iron Opens at 40 Yuan Per Plate

Due to the shortage of Hui Si iron at 200 pounds and the soaring price, the price has also risen in this port. The price is 40 yuan per box. It is reported that businesses from Tianjin and Qingdao purchased 400-500 boxes yesterday. Local can factories, cigarette factories, and paint companies also transacted over 400 boxes.

### “The Great Conscience”

— Li Ni

Since its formation, the amateur dramatic group has been committed to staging classical plays. However, an invisible boundary seems to have been set, namely that it must belong to realism. This was the case with the previously performed "A Doll's House" and "The Government Inspector," and it is also the case with the current staging of "The Power of Darkness" (Desire Demon) and "Thunderstorm." I agree with this choice very much, and I privately feel that it is very beneficial to the new movement in the current theater. Therefore, I am always happy to say a few words each time. Here, it is about Tolstoy and some matters concerning "The Power of Darkness."

I remember many years ago, there was a Chinese film called "Resurrection of Conscience," which was adapted from Tolstoy's novel "Resurrection." This time, I saw the description of "The Power of Darkness," which also contained the words of repentance made by the character Nikita in the play because of "the discovery of conscience." Tolstoy was once called "The Great Conscience," and linking "conscience" with Tolstoy has deep roots. However, I am afraid that after linking Tolstoy with conscience, it will cause this great writer to only fall into the shadow of passivity, and will obscure his positive side. In his half-century of activity, Tolstoy raised countless concrete questions about socialism. We must pay more attention to these questions than to his own moral completion, and then we can have a clearer understanding of the full picture of this great artist.

Tolstoy's main activities were after 1861, in the old Russia of the pre-revolutionary period, surviving under the semi-serfdom system—the rural Russia, the Russia of landlords and peasants. "The Power of Darkness" posed absolutely real and powerful questions to old Russia, but the contradictions and confusions that appeared when he tried to solve these problems are precisely what we should think about. Tolstoy and we are on the same front in attacking the private property system and other things; however, Tolstoy is a long way from us when he leads the solution of the problem to the moral completion of the individual.

"The Power of Darkness" was completed in 1886, but under the censorship system at that time, it was not immediately allowed to be staged. Here, talking about the persecution of this great genius by old Russia, preventing us from getting more plays besides his few scripts, I think, is meaningful to us. Below are Tolstoy's own words:

"I am very happy to write more scripts, and I feel that I have a special need to express myself in that area: but I know very well that the censor will not pass my plays. You may not believe it, but since I started my activities in this area, the terrible question of censorship has troubled me so much! I want to write according to what I feel, but at the same time, I know that what I write will not be passed; therefore, I have to give up this work. Giving up, giving up, and year after year has passed."

### A scene from "The Power of Darkness"

### Ostrovsky and "Thunderstorm"

— Lü Gang

Regarding the playwright Ostrovsky of the old Russian era, he does not seem to have attracted much attention in China. However, in the 19th century Russia, whether in literature or on stage, his works were the most tempting; therefore, Brucrner said: "If anyone wants to know Russia, he should read some of Ostrovsky's works." In fact, Ostrovsky not only had such a great influence in the 19th century, but also in the 20th century, his works are still loved by the vast majority of people. For example, in the 1933-34 Soviet theater season, his twenty-three works were staged in Moscow by twenty-six theaters in thirty-seven different ways; and among them, seventeen performances were the first attempts.

### The Female Lead Katrin in "Thunderstorm"

Naturally, there is no reason why Ostrovsky has such a great influence. Kropotkin believes: Ostrovsky "is the best manifestation of the mutual influence between the theater and playwright." And Nozaki Shao Fu said: "Ostrovsky is the most "theatrical" writer."

Next, Nozaki Shao Fu narrated the second reason "why Ostrovsky would attract Soviet audiences, actors, and directors so much": "because the leading trend of Soviet drama is realism."…

Indeed, among the realists of the old Russian era, Ostrovsky's great achievements cannot be ignored. Sheng Shumeng said in his book "Russian Modern Thought and Literature": "...Gogol's realism was later developed to a more mature stage by Goncharov, Ostrovsky, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, etc...." From here, one can think of Ostrovsky's indelible contribution to the road of realism in Russia. Generally speaking, Pushkin was the first person to lay the foundation for national literature in Russian literature, while Ostrovsky was the first and only creator of national drama in the Russian theater world.

Ostrovsky's "Thunderstorm," like Pushkin's "Dubrovsky," has already been filmed in the Soviet Union. Kropotkin believes that this is one of Ostrovsky's best plays: in his book "Ideals and Realities in Russian Literature," he said: ""Thunderstorm" is one of the most outstanding plays in modern Russian stage performance." In fact, the greatness of "Thunderstorm" is not an abstract statement like Kropotkin's: it is only "amazing." The main thing is that he completely and truthfully exposed the ugliness of the Russian petty bourgeoisie, without any mysticism, nor infatuation with romanticism, or abstractness like symbolism. "Thunderstorm" is full of the depression, injustice, and shouts of the old Russian era. The dark environment and gloomy atmosphere forced Katrin to take a dead end: jumping into the Volga River. ... This is a very cruel exposure of reality. Ostrovsky grew up in this era, he had the same depressed breathing, and experienced this situation, this climate. At that time, a critic Dobrolyubov wrote two long essays with the meaningful title "The Kingdom of Darkness" to analyze Ostrovsky's plays. This title just explained the characteristics of his plays: exposing this terrible "darkness." (End)

### A Scene of Tension in "Thunderstorm"

### Children's Night Talk

— By M. Koltsov

"Bersa, are you asleep?"

"Yes, I'm about to fall asleep."

"Bersa, I'm very hot."

"Then, kick off the blanket."

"Bersa, is the North Pole very cold?"

"It depends on where. Around the North Pole, the temperature gradually, gradually decreases until it completely disappears."

"That's fun. Where did it go? Who lives there?"

"Everything can live there. Bears, wolves, and parrots. The weather there is very bad. The weather only starts to change in June."

"Is tomorrow May 1st?"

"Yes. Now go to sleep. Tomorrow we have to run around all day in a truck."

"Bersa, why aren't you a Soviet hero?"

"I don't have time! We have a lot of homework, and there's no time left to learn to fly."

"But why do pilots wear goggles?"

"That's because the air in the sky is very thin. If you don't wear goggles, you can't see anything."

"Why is it called Franz Josef Land?"

"Because they always live there. I hope they are twins."

"Are you a twin?"

"Of course not. I don't even have time to breathe, how could I be a twin? Now the homework is so heavy! They have increased the teachers' salaries, and they are preparing to squeeze our oil. But what we get in return is also worth being thankful for. Arithmetic alone is worth the price. So is natural history. Do you know how far a kangaroo can jump? It can jump thirty-two feet."

"You're lying to me."

"It's true. The teacher said so. And it only uses two hind legs, otherwise it could jump even further."

"Bersa, I want to be a kangaroo too, okay?"

"You can't. It's an animal, but you are a child. It's absolutely impossible."

"Bersa, how do you know so much?"

"Think about it, I'm already in third grade!"

"Bersa, have you seen the Tsar?"

"I saw him once."

"Is he scary?"

"Not very scary. When you first see him, everyone feels scared, and to be honest, I was a bit excited myself. He has a big beard. But then he started running around in circles, the weavers, cooks, and old Grandma Babariga all followed him, bees stung them, people sang songs, beat drums, and he stroked his beard. It was very interesting at that time." (Note 1)

"Grandma said there are a lot of Tsars in Leningrad, but is that true?"

"Humph, if you believe Grandma's nonsense, your ears will fall off. What Tsar can live there? It's different from before the revolution. Now we don't need them except to guard the door in theaters or department stores."

"Were there children before the revolution?"

"Not many... yes. The Young Pioneers didn't have scarves then."

"You're lying to me."

"It's true. Generally speaking, everything that happened before the revolution can make us laugh to death. No demonstrations, no tangerines, no airplanes, the workers had to hide, Uncle Bobonov was imprisoned, Uncle Simite didn't even have a beard. Only Pushkin wrote poetry, but he was killed by a fascist."

"Ah, you're just lying to me."

"It's definitely true. Why would I make up stories? Many people say that."

"How long ago was that?"

"Four hundred years ago. I don't think I was born then. I was born on August 6th, and cannons were fired on my birthday."

"Can the pre-revolutionary era start again?"

"Of course not. Do you think a born tangerine can fall back into the soil? Uncle Bobonov won't go to jail again. Even if the barber shaves Simite's beard, it will grow back as it was."

"Where is Uncle Bobonov?"

"He is our Nankopolis." (Note 2)

"Have you seen him?"

"I haven't. I don't pretend to have seen him."

"Bersa, are you asleep?"

"Yes. Why can't you sleep? It's almost ten o'clock, because half an hour has passed since a quarter past nine."

"Bersa, will they buy you a bicycle?"

"I don't know. I'm afraid not. Nothing goes right for me, and I can't do anything good. Arithmetic is difficult. It doesn't matter to me, but if I get a bad grade, Mom will be very annoyed... that's why I haven't been to the theater for two weeks. You children are lucky, you don't have anything to think about, and you don't have to do any work."

"When I grow up, I don't want to work. Five days out of the week, I want to go to the theater. Three days to the Young Pioneer Palace, three days to play in the yard, and the rest of the days are May 1st."

"Why is Grandma so upset with you?"

"Because of the post office. I told her how we play postman: we ran through all the floors, and everyone was given letters. She smiled and kissed me and asked, 'Where did you children get so many letters?' I replied, 'From your desk, Grandma! There's a big package tied with a red ribbon.' When she heard that, she cried and cursed. But we only took the letters, not the ribbon."

"She's an interesting old thing... there aren't many old folks left now. Even if there are, they are just those remnants of the pre-revolution."

"Bersa, are fairy tales true stories?"

"It depends on the situation. Some are true, some are made up by the priests. They are false."

"Is the story of the flying carpet true?"

"Yes, that's Fudopi Nov."

"Then what about Sleeping Beauty?"

"It was imagined by the priests."

"Then what about Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece and Medusa?"

"Yes. I think that's a true story. Just look at our arithmetic teacher. She is a Medusa. I haven't done anything bad to her. When the children dragged a dead mouse into the classroom, I wasn't even there. But she still wants to punish me. Even when the calculation is correct, she still looks at me like a cheapskate and mocks me, saying, 'It would be interesting to find out who you copied it from, right?' She keeps mocking me, mocking me... Heh, are you falling asleep?"

"No, I'm thinking: what if tomorrow isn't May 1st!"

"It definitely is, definitely. I remember so many times May 1st. When I was very young, only three years old, it was May 1st on that day too. It is impossible for tomorrow not to be May 1st. This is not like the fascist way."

"But, in reality, don't the fascists have demonstrations?"

"Yes, they have demonstrations. But it's not very easy for them. Every minute they have to rush back to the prison to see if any workers have escaped."

"Aren't they fattening themselves up with this method?"

"Yes, they are probably very fat. They still want to come here."

"Why?"

"They want us to send people for them to eat."

"Why do you know so many things?"

"This is nothing strange. Anyway, I'm already a third grader." (Translated by He Jiahua) (Note 1) The source is a fairy tale by Pushkin. Bersa undoubtedly saw it performed in a children's theater. (Note 2) The Soviet People's Commissar of Education.

### What to Imagine?

— Ke

Love,

That's just the beautiful dream of past life.

Today's Cupid has broken off the arrow,

Picked up a gun,

For begging,

For freedom,

Blood and tears replace smiles,

Battle forgets love.

Young man, what do you imagine!

Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Shanghai Income Tax Office, in order to make the details of income tax collection clear to all sectors and facilitate payment, yesterday specially re-released a draft of the "Income Tax Collection Guide for the Second Category: Salaries and Remuneration." The Shen Shi News Agency reporter has recorded it as follows: ㊀ The scope of public officials is as follows: 1. Personnel of party departments at all levels and their affiliated agencies; 2. Personnel of central and local governments and their affiliated agencies; 3. Staff and teachers of national, provincial, municipal, and county schools; 4. Personnel of state-run enterprises; 5. Personnel of local Japanese governance groups; 6. Other personnel engaged in public service in accordance with laws and regulations. ㊁ Laborers and workers of the aforementioned agencies and organizations are not public officials and should belong to the scope of other industries. ㊂ Personnel engaged in public service, regardless of nationality or position, shall have their income from salaries and remuneration withheld income tax in accordance with Article 27, Paragraph 3 of the Implementing Rules. ㊃ Expenses incurred by public officials for official purposes are not within the scope of salaries and remuneration and are not subject to taxation. ㊄ The salaries and remuneration of public officials shall be calculated and taxed based on the original amount paid, without deducting any expenses. ㊅ Self-employed individuals and others engaged in various industries, in addition to the salaries and remuneration earned through labor in their main business, if they also operate a profit-making business related to their main business, their income from salaries and remuneration and profit-making income shall be calculated and taxed separately. ㊆ If the income from salaries and remuneration for business purposes is in the form of goods or securities, it shall be calculated in legal currency based on the market price at the time of giving. ㊇ As stipulated in Article 17 of the Implementing Rules, the deductible expenses are limited to those with business premises. ㊈ The following items belong to the expenses stipulated in Paragraph 4 of the same article: 1. Repair fees for business equipment; 2. Advertising fees; 3. Association membership fees; 4. Stationery, postage, telecommunications, and other miscellaneous expenses. ㊉ Labor insurance expenses for workers may be deducted from salaries and remuneration. ㊉㊀ Self-employed individuals and others engaged in various industries who have joint business premises shall calculate their income and expenses separately based on their agreed share. ㊉㊁ For income from salaries and remuneration calculated on a monthly basis, if the income is less than one month, the actual amount of income shall be used to calculate and tax based on the original amount paid. (For example, if Mr. A's fixed monthly salary is 400 yuan and he leaves his job after half a month, with an actual payment of 200 yuan, the tax shall be calculated at the original tax rate for 400 yuan, with a tax of 4.8 yuan.) ㊉㊂ If a public agency or employer fails to pay the full salary on a monthly basis, the tax shall be calculated in accordance with the following regulations: 1. For those who pay salaries at a discount, the tax shall first be calculated based on the actual amount paid. When the unpaid portion is paid, it shall be combined with the paid portion to calculate and pay the tax difference. For example, if Mr. A's monthly salary is 300 yuan and he is first paid 60%, which is 180 yuan, a tax of 2.2 yuan shall be temporarily calculated based on the tax rate of the first paid portion. When the remaining 40%, which is 120 yuan, is paid, it shall be combined with the paid portion, i.e., a tax of 5.6 yuan shall be levied monthly based on the tax rate of 300 yuan. In addition to the 2.2 yuan already paid, 3.4 yuan shall be paid monthly. 2. For those who use advances instead of paying salaries, the tax difference shall be calculated and paid in accordance with the calculation method of the previous clause based on the actual amount borrowed in each month. ㊉㊃ For income from salaries and remuneration calculated on an annual basis, the total amount of income for one year shall be divided by the number of months in one year, and the resulting number shall be the monthly average. For example, if Mr. A's annual salary is 1,200 yuan, it shall be divided by twelve, and the monthly average is 100 yuan, with a tax of 0.6 yuan. A total of 7.2 yuan shall be taxed for twelve months, and it shall be withheld and paid together at the time of payment. ㊉㊄ Income with a fixed term, such as salaries and remuneration calculated on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, or fixed-term allowances, shall be calculated in the same way as the previous paragraph, with the number of months in the period and the amount of income averaged. ㊉㊅ If there is income from salaries and remuneration calculated on a monthly basis and calculated on an annual basis at the same time, or if there is income with a fixed term, when there are two or more types, they shall be calculated and averaged together. For example, if Mr. A's monthly salary is 300 yuan and he pays income tax of 5.6 yuan monthly, and he receives an annual bonus of 1,200 yuan at the end of the year, the amount of the annual bonus shall be divided by the number of months in one year, and the resulting monthly average is 100 yuan. Adding this to the monthly salary of 300 yuan, Mr. A's monthly average income is 400 yuan, and the monthly tax should be 9.6 yuan. In addition to the 5.6 yuan already withheld monthly, an additional tax of 4 yuan is required monthly, with a total of 48 yuan in additional tax for the entire year, which shall be paid together when the annual bonus is paid. If the monthly salary increases or decreases during that year, it shall be calculated in accordance with the above-mentioned method when paying the additional tax. ㊉㊆ The amount of income tax payable for income from salaries and remuneration shall be calculated in accordance with the attached table. ㊉㊇ When paying salaries and remuneration each month, heads of agencies or employers shall deduct the income tax payable by their directly affiliated public officials or their employees separately and send it directly to the local Central Bank or other tax collection agencies entrusted by it, obtain a receipt, and fill out the Category II, Type A or Type C Income Statement, along with the withholding list, and report it to the local competent collection agency. If there are circumstances mentioned in Items 13 to 16 of this Guide, the withholding agency shall indicate them separately when reporting. ㊉㊈ Self-employed individuals and others engaged in various industries, if there is no fixed paying agency or employer, shall settle their accounts once every six months starting from January 1, 1937, fill out the Category II, Type B Income Statement based on the average monthly income, and if expenses need to be deducted, they shall also submit an income and expenditure statement on the settlement date to the local competent collection agency to verify the income amount and the tax payable, and pay the tax payable to the local Central Bank or its entrusted tax collection agencies within twenty days from the date of reporting, and obtain a receipt. ㊁㊉ If self-employed individuals and others engaged in various industries fail to provide supporting documents and records during investigations or reviews by the competent collection agency, the competent collection agency may directly determine their income amount based on their business situation.

### Chen Guangfu and Guo Bingwen Gave a Banquet for Patrick Last Night

Over Eighty People Attended, Including Brennan and Chen Xing. Mr. Patrick Expressed Surprise at the Development of Our Industries

Mr. Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, upon returning to Shanghai from Beijing, was given a banquet last night at the International Hotel by Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Bank, and Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, in view of his significant relationship with the future of our country's construction. The banquet was a grand occasion.

The guests were seated. Those invited to accompany included British Consul General in Shanghai Brennan, Commercial Counselor Peter, Financial Counselor Hopper, Chamber of Commerce President Marshall, Swire Group General Manager Mickle, Brunner Mond General Manager Canleli, Financial Advisor to our Ministry of Finance Rogers, and banking figures Chen Xing, Xi Demao, Ye Zhuotang, Song Hanzhang, Bei Songsun, Xu Xinliu, Wu YunChu, Li Fusun, Zhou Zuomin, Huang Jiangquan, Qin Runqing, Liu Hongsheng, Cai Shengbai, Sun Zhongli, Guo Le, Guo Shun, Tang Shoumin, Yu Qiaqing, Lu Bohong, Yang Jiemei, Zhu Rutang, Xia Xiaofang, and others, totaling over eighty people.

Mr. Guo's Speech. During the banquet, Guo Bingwen delivered a welcome speech, stating that Mr. Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, had recently arrived in Shanghai. Today, Mr. Chen Guangfu and I have prepared a simple feast to welcome him. Everyone present is a leading figure in the banking and industrial sectors and is well aware of Mr. Patrick's past history and experience, so I won't waste words. The purpose of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department appointing Mr. Patrick to this position is probably to allow the representative of the department to make suggestions to the department after on-site inspections. In other words, to examine the creditworthiness of buyers of British goods and recommend them to the headquarters. The British Export Credits Guarantee Department's appointment of this capable representative to take on this huge task is sufficient to show that the United Kingdom has a very strong trust in the future of China. At present, the unity and stability of China's politics, the rapid progress of construction, and the gradual development of industry and commerce have been recognized by the world. Therefore, the British government is assisting its manufacturers and providing long-term credit assistance and encouragement to those who purchase British goods, so that they can participate more in China's construction projects. Therefore, Mr. Patrick's assumption of this position can not only increase Sino-British trade but also promote a deeper understanding of the friendship between the two countries. I am convinced that everyone present wishes Mr. Patrick success and is willing to cooperate as much as possible, etc.

Mr. Patrick's Reply. After Mr. Guo finished his speech, Mr. Patrick stood up to thank him, saying that he was honored to be invited by the two hosts today and to meet with the leaders of Shanghai's financial and industrial sectors. He hoped that he would have a deeper understanding of everyone in the future and increase opportunities for discussion. China's politics have been unified, and the progress of construction will be rapid in the future. In the past, when he was in India, India had cotton yarn shipped to China. Yesterday, he received the China Trade Report from Director Guo, which showed that China's cotton yarn exports were being shipped to India, which shows the amazing development of industry in recent years. Although his duties here are related to material aspects, he deeply believes that it can also be used to enhance the understanding and friendship between the two countries, etc. During the banquet, drinks were exchanged, and the hosts and guests dispersed with joy until around 11:00 PM.

### Swire's New Beijing Wheel Ran Aground Yesterday Morning

The Bottom of the Ship Has Been Broken, But the Passengers Have Been Safely Rescued.

Central News Agency reports that Swire Shipping Company's New Beijing Wheel, which runs on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, ran aground on the Miri Siis Reef at 5:00 AM yesterday morning, 24 nautical miles from Ningbo (5 miles from Zhenhai). After the ship ran aground, it telegraphed the Shanghai-Ningbo general and branch companies to find a way to rescue it. Upon receiving the telegram, the Shanghai General Company immediately dispatched a special ship to the scene of the accident for rescue. The ship departed from Shanghai for Ningbo at 5:00 PM on the 20th, carrying more than 500 passengers and a large amount of cargo. It is reported that Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and took the ship to Ningbo. After the ship ran aground, Mr. Shen immediately telegraphed his family in Shanghai. His wife, upon learning of this, took the early express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou and then to Ningbo at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. However, according to Swire Shipping Company's ticket office, Mr. Shen had come to book a cabin yesterday morning, but he canceled his ticket before departure and took the New NingShao to Ningbo instead.

It is reported that the bottom of the ship has been broken and needs to be repaired in a shipyard.

### 44 Foreigners From Shaanxi and Gansu Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday

Tan's Bandit Army Actively Deploys Military Affairs, But the National Army's Decisive Suppression Will Be Difficult to Sustain

A Central News Agency report states that after the tense situation in Shaanxi and Gansu, foreign nationals residing in the two provinces felt extremely uneasy. Through the best efforts of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a group of 75 foreigners left Xi'an on the 19th to go south. Among them, 44 arrived in Shanghai by train at 7:00 yesterday morning, while the remaining 31 disembarked in Luoyang, Jinan, Nanjing, and other places. Among the 44 foreigners who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning were citizens of Britain, the United States, and France. According to their statements upon arrival in Shanghai, Yang Hucheng is still surrounded by the Communist bandits and seems to have no way to break out of the situation. Near Xi'an, the actions of the bandit army are very intense. In an area about 150 miles east of Xi'an, large-scale military projects have been built, such as trenches eight feet deep, air raid shelters, and electric fences. About eight or nine miles northwest of Xi'an, there are now about 15,000 bandit troops. Some of the Communist bandit leaders, such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, are in Xi'an city. These people are now starting to prepare to form a Red Army air force. It is also stated that although the Communist bandits are actively equipping and deploying, they firmly believe that if the Central Army implements a suppression, it will not be able to last long and can be quickly eliminated. Due to traffic obstruction in the Xi'an area, external news is unclear. No external letters or newspapers have been received since December 12 of last year.

According to the English-language "China Press," 44 foreign missionaries who left Xi'an on Monday arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 21st) on the Beijing-Shanghai express train. It is said that Xi'an is now garrisoned by Yang Hucheng's troops, while Zhang Xueliang's troops are stationed outside the city. Military movements are very busy around Xi'an. Yang is actually driven by the Communist bandit leaders. Yang's troops have not yet entered the city, but the paper money they use has appeared in the market. As for anti-Japanese sentiments, it is just a disguise. Commercial activity in Xi'an has completely stopped, and prices have skyrocketed, but the current situation is still peaceful. According to the missionaries, Zhang Xueliang cannot escape blame for this rebellion. A total of 77 foreign missionaries left Xi'an, traveling in three long-distance buses and three freight trucks. On the way to Tongguan, they passed through three trench lines, all of which were covered with thick planks to allow passage. There are currently three foreigners remaining in the rebel army: an American female author, Smedley; a British journalist, Bertram; and a German woman of Chinese descent. The three broadcast propaganda on the Xi'an radio station every night. The missionaries who arrived in Shanghai plan to stay in Shanghai to wait for the unrest to subside before returning to Xi'an. Several Catholic priests are staying in Luoyang, and several others are staying in Zhengzhou. The rest are going north to Jinan and Beiping. Among those who arrived in Shanghai this morning are 25 missionaries from Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, 7 British missionaries, 3 children, 8 Russian missionaries, and the Swedish explorer, Sirén. There are still 5 British missionaries and 2 Russians associated with the agricultural experiment station residing in Xi'an, but they will also leave the country within days. Two American missionaries in Pingliang have telegraphed the American authorities in Hankou, saying they will go to Hanzhong and do not want to leave Shaanxi.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministries of Finance and Industry to Oppose Tax Exemption for Foreign Rice

Measures to Facilitate Transportation Should Be Planned

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent telegrams to the Ministries of Finance and Industry in Nanjing, stating: "To Their Excellencies of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: According to a letter from the Grain Trade Association dated the 20th of this month, since the unification of import taxes on foreign rice, rice from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui has been shipped to Guangdong in large quantities. Our merchants have also purchased and transported rice from the above provinces in large quantities to regulate the market. This helps to offset the outflow of funds and benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, now Guangdong Province has petitioned the central government to exempt foreign rice from import tax. If this is implemented, not only will a huge amount of scarce capital flow out, but the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will further decline, and the impact on the prosperity of various industries will be profound. Currently, top-grade Jiangxi machine-milled rice in the Shanghai market weighs 180 catties per bag. Shipping it from Shanghai to Guangdong costs an additional yuan, so each yuan can buy 15 catties. Compared to Shanghai Changxi white rice, which currently sells for 14 catties per yuan, the Shanghai-Guangdong comparison seems quite balanced. Moreover, compared to wheat, which only buys 14 or 15 catties per yuan, and soybeans, which buy 15 or 16 catties per yuan, the price of rice is clearly not as high as beans and wheat. Furthermore, the crux of the rice shortage in Guangdong Province lies in the large disparity in exchange rates between Shanghai and Guangdong. 1,500 Guangdong yuan is only worth 1,000 Shanghai yuan. If the Guangdong currency can be raised to the same level as the Shanghai currency, Guangdong rice will naturally become cheaper. According to detailed reports from merchants in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, rice waiting to be transported is abundant in warehouses and even stored in rural areas. If water and land transportation are smooth, supply and demand can naturally correspond, and there will be no shortage. Therefore, the request from Guangdong Province to exempt foreign rice from tax is a short-sighted view. This Chamber of Commerce, engaged in this industry, has more accurate observations and dares not remain silent. We earnestly request that you forward this to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, take into account the overall situation, and do not approve it. We would be extremely grateful." The Chamber also stated, "The reason Guangdong Province is requesting an exemption from foreign rice import tax is simply because of a rice shortage. However, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have always exported surplus rice to other provinces, and last year was a bumper year. Using the surplus grain from these four provinces to supply the food for the people of Guangdong Province, according to reason, there should be no shortage. Rice from Hunan and Hubei can enter Guangdong via the Yuehan Railway, and rice from Jiangxi and Anhui can enter Shantou via the Yangtze River and then by sea. Compared to Siamese and Vietnamese rice imported from abroad, the speed should not be significantly different. When rice arrives in abundance, prices will naturally stabilize. Currently, the only concern is that the inspection of Hunan rice is too strict and there are not enough vehicles for road transport, which may lead to less rice arriving and high prices. However, this is a temporary issue. If officials and merchants in Guangdong Province can cooperate with officials and merchants in the four provinces to properly plan measures to facilitate transportation, there is no way to remedy the situation. As for hastily requesting tax exemption for foreign rice, it will increase leakage and damage public funds, which is not a win-win solution for the country and the people. We hereby submit this to your ministry for review and request your leadership, which would be in the public interest. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits."

### Three Rice Industry Groups Jointly Announce to Fellow Traders to Strive to Solicit Donations for Aircraft Purchase

A joint meeting was held on the 8th of this month at the Bean and Rice Industry Beishi Office, attended by Gu Xin-yi of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, Jiang Shi-zhi of the Hubbei Rice Carriers Joint Benefit Association, Lu Mu-qin of the Changshu Guild, Zhang Song-tao and Cha Bao-san of the Rice Grain Trade Association, and Fu Qian-geng and Wu Ji-yun of the Bean and Rice Industry North Office, as well as Zhang Yu-liang, a staff member of our association, who attended the discussion and resolved: ㊀ That the rice merchants are responsible for deducting a total of 11,000 yuan in national currency, and the trading companies are responsible for deducting 5,000 yuan ('including those previously deducted'); ㊁ That, based on the opinions of all parties, and with the voluntary request of the Miscellaneous Grain Industry itself, the 'Miscellaneous Grain Company' aircraft be renamed 'People's Food' aircraft; ㊂ That the Soliciting Donations for Aircraft and Birthday Celebration Committee be requested to reward them with reference to the Miscellaneous Grain Industry example; ㊃ That the above resolutions be forwarded by the Soliciting Donations for Aircraft and Birthday Celebration Committee to the Municipal Party Department for transmission to all groups in Beishi for compliance and implementation, etc., are recorded on file. In addition to separate handling, a corresponding letter is hereby sent to the above for reference and notification, and to strive to carry out the solicitation, complete the mission as soon as possible, etc.' Approved. In addition to separate orders, the association is hereby ordered to comply with the resolutions and strive to promote them. This is of utmost importance. This order, etc., is hereby recorded and announced, hoping that you will refer to it and advise the rice merchants to resume donating the full amount immediately to complete the entire project. This is what we hope for. This announcement is made on January 21, 26th year."

### The American Association's Grand Gathering Yesterday Morning

Listening to President Roosevelt's Inaugural Address, Cheering Resonated From Both Locations

The Shanghai Times reported that last night (the 20th), about 500 American residents and guests in the city gathered in a room at the American Association to listen to the inaugural address of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt from thousands of miles away. At 1:30 AM, a wireless report announced that President Roosevelt, accompanied by his son, had ascended the platform to take the solemn oath of office. Then, President Roosevelt's loud voice was heard, saying, "I, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help me God." This oath was first read by Chief Justice Hughes, and then repeated by President Roosevelt. At that time, the listeners in the Association all cheered, echoing the cheers in Washington. President Roosevelt then delivered his inaugural address. Last night, the American residents in the city were overjoyed, first holding banquets in various places, and after 11:30 PM, they flocked to the Association. A late-night snack was prepared in the Association, hosted by the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, the Chamber of Commerce, and the presidents of various associations such as the American Association. At around 1:15 AM, the wireless broadcast began to report that the leader of the diplomatic corps, the British Ambassador, had entered the hall with the diplomatic corps, and Chinese Ambassador Dr. Shi Zhaoji was also among them. It was also reported that tens of thousands of people had gathered in the square outside the Capitol. The place where President Roosevelt delivered his speech was built in the style of the home of the seventh U.S. President, Jackson. President Roosevelt sat at President Lincoln's old desk. Since President Lincoln, every president has sat there during the last few hours of Congress's adjournment, which has become a tradition. At this time, it was 12:15 PM (Washington time). A transition between the old and the new, during these fifteen minutes, the United States can be said to have no president. Then, the U.S. Marine Corps band played celebratory music, mixed with the cheers of the crowd. Thus, the president's speech could not be heard clearly. Then, the White House Bishop recited a prayer. President Roosevelt's and Vice President Garner's oath-taking took place at 1:30 AM Shanghai time, and President Roosevelt's speech ended at 1:50 AM.

The original text reads: "To His Excellency Chairman Chiang in Fenghua: You are the only supreme leader of our country. You are loyal to the country and work tirelessly day and night. This time, after escaping danger in Xi'an and returning to Nanjing, you have repeatedly submitted requests to resign. The central government has retained you and decided to grant you a month's leave. Now, the rebels are rampant and the country is in difficulty. We earnestly request Your Excellency to return to Nanjing to take charge of the central government in order to reassure the people and benefit the country. This telegram is hereby delivered. Please note." Another telegram was sent to public organizations, institutions, and newspapers throughout the country (omitted above). The telegram to Chairman Chiang read: (Same as the above telegram). "Please unanimously advocate and urge for the benefit of the country. This is reported in the telegram. Joint Meeting of Representatives of Various Groups in Shanghai."

Listing Zhang's Crimes: Zhang Xueliang's eleven major crimes of harming the country and the people: 1. Kidnapping the Commander-in-Chief and rebelling against his superior: Zhang Xueliang held the position of Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression and Acting Commander-in-Chief. Therefore, Chairman Chiang was his direct superior, but he dared to kidnap him in Xi'an for nearly two weeks, arbitrarily coercing him and subjecting him to various harsh treatments and surveillance. Even when members of the Central Committee, such as Shao Lizi, came to visit, they were monitored. His battalion commander, under Zhang's instructions, even carried weapons and demanded to move him, although he was reprimanded and left. However, his lawlessness and unreasonableness can be seen from this. Zhang's crime of rebelling against his superior is obvious. This is his first crime. 2. Lightly initiating civil war and harming the country and the people: Since the founding of the Republic of China, all civil wars, such as the Fengzhi, Zhiwan, Luqi, and wars against the National Army, have exhausted the country's strength. Which of these was not initiated directly or indirectly by Zhang Xueliang? In these several wars, people were displaced and suffered losses of no less than millions. If the people of the country have not forgotten, the tragic situation should be unbearable to recall. Zhang's crime of harming the country and the people is his second crime. 3. Losing four provinces and humiliating the country: During the September 18th Incident, Zhang Xueliang was the highest official in the Northeast. When the incident was urgent, he was still lingering in Beiping, reveling all day long, dancing like a butterfly, and indulging in wine and pleasure. The newspapers reported it, and both Chinese and foreigners ridiculed him. He did not think about defending the territory and repaying the country, fulfilling his duties, but instead lost four provinces and humiliated the country with non-resistance. This is his third crime. 4. Delaying the defense of the Great Wall and missing opportunities: During the defense of the Great Wall, Zhang Xueliang sat idly by and perfunctorily responded without fighting hard. He was also reluctant to leave Tianjin and Beiping, acting as a military obstacle everywhere, missing opportunities. The whole country was indignant and everyone wanted to kill him. Our Chairman Chiang graciously tolerated him and allowed him to go abroad safely. Now, he has returned to the country and is engaged in this illegal activity again. It is heartbreaking to talk about. This is his fourth crime. 5. Seizing territory and taking advantage of opportunities: During the war in the 19th year of the Republic of China, Zhang Xueliang stirred up trouble on both sides. He also monitored the representatives sent by the central government to Shenyang and ordered them to lead their troops to Tianjin and Beiping. At first, he hesitated and observed the situation. When the victory or defeat was decided, he reorganized his troops and entered the pass, seizing the territory of Tianjin and Hebei, taking advantage of opportunities. He also claimed to support the central government and Chairman Chiang, shameless to this extent. This is his fifth crime. 6. Deducting military pay and misappropriating funds: Zhang Xueliang, in possession of troops, neither fulfilled his duty to defend the territory nor made efforts to suppress bandits. He only knew how to deduct military pay and enrich his own pockets. He also harbored sinister intentions and misappropriated funds for Northeast University, etc., recruiting undesirable elements and creating forces to oppose the central government, causing officers and soldiers to lack pay. He also falsely accused the central government of unfair treatment and deceived his subordinates. This is his sixth crime. 7. Surrendering to the Red bandits and boasting shamelessly: Zhang Xueliang did not move forward according to the established national policy of the central government, but dared to make his own claims and boast shamelessly, as if saving the country and the people could only be done this way. He did not know that the Red bandits had their own Soviet government and Red Army organization. How could two governments and armies be tolerated in one country? It was not only tolerating the Communists, but actually surrendering to the bandits. He was mad and acted arbitrarily, only seeking his own interests, disregarding the party and the country. This is his seventh crime. 8. Obstructing bandit suppression and shaking the foundation of the country: Zhang Xueliang knew that the bandit suppression work could be completed in the last two weeks and the country could achieve unification, and all forces could be used to deal with foreign aggression. However, at this time, he suddenly launched an unprecedented coup, causing eight years of hard work to fall short and all the lives of soldiers and civilians and social forces sacrificed in the past to be wasted, and the foundation of the country was greatly affected. This is his eighth crime. 9. Destroying national defense and deepening the enemy's woes: In recent years, the country has been doing everything in its power to build up the Northwest and develop transportation and economy to make it a national defense base. However, Zhang's rebellion in Xi'an completely destroyed it. If it is to be restored to its former state, it will take more time and effort to succeed. The Suiyuan front line is engaged in fierce combat, and the soldiers are wholeheartedly defending the country against foreign aggression. However, the Xi'an Incident has greatly affected them. Zhang boasts about resisting the enemy, but he actually destroys the foundation of national defense to help deepen the enemy's woes. This is his ninth crime. 10. Detaining vehicles and using them to aid the enemy: Before the September 18th Incident, Zhang Xueliang handed over the best vehicles from the Beining, Pinghan, and Jinpu lines, totaling about 2,000, pulled them out of the pass and did not return them. After the September 18th Incident, due to the loss of land due to non-resistance, the vehicles were completely used to aid the enemy. What is the extent of this loss in national transportation resources? This is his tenth crime. 11. Plundering the people's wealth to fill his own pockets: Zhang Xueliang now has deposits in banks at home and abroad totaling tens of millions of yuan. Which of these are not the people's hard-earned wealth from the people of the Northeast? Plundering the people's wealth to fill his own pockets. This is his eleventh crime. The above eleven crimes are the most obvious and major crimes of Zhang Xueliang in harming the country and the people. As for Zhang Xueliang's personal life, his extravagance and licentiousness are known throughout the world. Roads are advertised, and both Chinese and foreigners are shocked. In short, his crimes are too numerous to count. As for his private deposits, which originally belonged to the people's fat and blood, the country's blood, we should demand a public investigation and return them to the state. If the traitor is not eliminated, the disaster will not end. All our compatriots should promptly settle accounts, file lawsuits in court, and be sure to bring him to justice before stopping. This is hereby announced above for your public knowledge.

### Yesterday the Situation Became Increasingly Serious, Almost All Pharmacies Had Their Electricity Cut Off

Police Were Dispatched to Seal Off Store Doors and Arrest Store Employees; The Entire City's Industry Was Highly Indignant Upon Hearing the News

The Strike Wave of Pharmacies in the French Concession

Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The pharmacy strike wave in the French Concession intensified yesterday as the French Municipal Council completely cut off electricity to all pharmacies, dispatched police to seal off pharmacies such as Xiuxin Tang, and arrested Feng Meiying, wife of the owner of Gaodesheng Tang, and store employee Ma Yan Kang, etc. The situation became even more serious, and the entire city's industry was highly indignant. The executive and supervisory committee members of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association went to the municipal government yesterday afternoon to petition, urging them to quickly negotiate to avoid expansion. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, asking them to consider the difficulties of businesses and not to force harsh levies, but the Municipal Council refused to accept it. The details are as follows:

The Situation Became Increasingly Serious Yesterday: The strike wave of pharmacies in the French Concession has entered a more serious stage. According to reporter investigations, the French Municipal Council dispatched personnel again yesterday morning to warn each pharmacy that if they continued to resist paying the levy, all electricity would be cut off. Each pharmacy ignored this and adhered to the association's resolution. Yesterday morning, Xiuxin Tang on Kangti Road, Lirunde, and Mitianyi Tang on Jin Shenfu Road were the first to have their electricity cut off, and the store entrances were sealed off with barbed wire and other obstacles. Police were dispatched to guard the front and rear doors. After 2 PM, the Municipal Council dispatched police cars to cut off electricity to the striking pharmacies. By about 5 PM, according to reports received by the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, almost all had their electricity cut off. Moreover, Feng Meiying, wife of Gao Yu Feng, manager of Gaodetang Pharmacy on Malang Road, and store employee Ma Yan Kang, etc., were also arrested and handcuffed. Observing the situation, it will be difficult to resolve for a while. The entire city's industry was extremely saddened and indignant upon receiving the news. The Pharmaceutical Industry Association has scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for 2 PM this afternoon to discuss the first step in response.

The Pharmaceutical Industry Association Requests Prompt Negotiations: Cen Zhiliang, etc., executive and supervisory committee members of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, prepared a petition yesterday afternoon at 1 PM and went to the municipal government to petition. Yu Mingqian, a section member of the Second Section, received them. After stating the petition's intention, Yu section member said that the municipal government was very concerned about the pharmacy strike wave. After receiving the report from the Social Affairs Bureau, Secretary Geng Jiaji was dispatched to negotiate with the French Consul General today (yesterday). He has not returned yet. They will notify your association of the result later and advise all colleagues to wait quietly for a resolution. The committee members returned satisfied.

A Six-Point Explanation Regarding the French Side: The Pharmaceutical Industry Association refuted the reasons announced by the French Municipal Council in its notice, stating that: ⑴ The strike by the entire industry in the French Concession was incited by the French Municipal Council cutting off electricity. The French Municipal Council should bear the responsibility for instigating the strike. ⑵ The detailed regulations for the additional levy were not notified in advance, and the levy rate was completely unfounded. ⑶ The pharmaceutical industry already has a categorized business tax. Adding a pharmaceutical sales regulation tax is an unnecessary layering of taxes. The taxes paid by Chinese pharmacists do not need to be equal to those of foreign pharmacists. ⑷ The water and electricity companies are profit-making organizations. Users have an obligation to pay fees and the right to use them, which has no relationship to the Municipal Council's so-called "taxes levied on residents are commensurate with the benefits of the public facilities they receive." ⑸ Although the Municipal Council has expressed that it may reduce the levy by half, even half still requires the ability to pay and must be an acceptable amount. ⑹ The council's claim that it is instigated by a few people attempting to cause harm is laughable to knowledgeable people.

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Letter to the Municipal Council: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the French Municipal Council, stating: "Respectfully, regarding the collection of the Chinese medicinal material and drug sales tax in your concession, we wrote to your council on the 14th of this month requesting that you stop the excessively oppressive collection. We also sent a letter to the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, instructing them to inform us of the details of the aforementioned levy and advising them to make reasonable requests and not to go to extremes. These matters are on file. Now, according to the association's follow-up letter (omitted), please grant assistance, etc. We are enclosing a copy of the Chinese medicinal material and drug sales regulations and a translation of your council's reply. Based on this, we have found that the Chinese pharmacies operating in your concession pay taxes such as police and categorized business taxes. Now, imposing a business tax on top of that is layering taxes, and the industry truly cannot bear the squeeze. Moreover, according to Article 6 of the Chinese medicinal material and drug retail sales regulations, if they are unable to pay the tax, they only need to be prosecuted in the jurisdictional court. Now, abruptly cutting off water and electricity has incited the industry to strike. At this time of severe winter and the end of the year, it not only hinders the commercial security within the concession but also delays treatment for sick residents, which is no small matter. Correspondingly, we continue to inform you of the situation, hoping that your council will investigate and take a fair and lenient view, not just thinking of the levy collectors' side and considering the ability of Chinese pharmacists to bear the burden, and forcefully restrain the forced levy procedure of cutting off water and electricity. We are deeply grateful and hope to receive a reply." Addressed to the French Municipal Council.

The French Municipal Council's Reply to the Chamber of Commerce: The French Municipal Council replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Respectfully replying, we have received your letter regarding the suspension of water and electricity for the collection of the 1936 drug tax from Chinese pharmacies and request that you stop it. We have reviewed it thoroughly. This case was decided by a meeting of the French Consulate General in Shanghai on December 8, 1935, and there is no reason to cancel it. Moreover, in February of last year, because of the pharmaceutical industry's downturn and fearing that the pharmacies would not be able to include the drug tax in their annual budget, we specially approved a reduction of the tax amount from two-thirds of the original amount to one-half. All those who have paid the tax will be calculated and refunded according to one-half. Currently, our council has notified all pharmacies within the concession that they must pay this one-half drug tax, otherwise, in addition to suspending water and electricity, we will still pursue the full year's tax amount. Our council cannot change the established regulations. We hereby reply to your letter for your information." Addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

The Second Special District Jointly Requests the Recall of the Order: The Citizen's United Association of the Second Special District wrote to the French Municipal Council, stating: "Respectfully, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Pharmaceutical Industry Association stating that the French Municipal Council is forcibly collecting drug and medicinal material sales taxes and is adopting barbaric methods, ordering the water and electricity company to dispatch personnel to cut off the water and electricity of Chinese pharmacies such as Daren Tang, Guangsheng Tang on Baxianqiao, and Taishan Tang on Damalu, as a coercion for collecting taxes. Please grant assistance, etc. Upon review, your council should carefully consider the current commercial situation when collecting new taxes. In this autumn of economic depression and the decline of all industries, maintaining the status quo is already difficult for each industry. If heavy taxes are suddenly increased, how can merchants and residents bear them? Now, your council is recklessly collecting these layered taxes, and merchants and residents naturally want to refuse. Unexpectedly, your council is using the means of cutting off electricity to force tax collection because tax collection is unsuccessful. This kind of erroneous action is not appropriate for the municipal authorities. Taxes and water and electricity are clearly two different things. Proper taxes are the obligations that citizens should fulfill. Water and electricity are commercial in nature and are paid directly by citizens to the water and electricity company for use. If there are no outstanding water and electricity fees, water and electricity should not be cut off. Now, your council is using cutting off electricity as coercion for tax collection, which is inappropriate in terms of both human relations and legal principles. Therefore, the citizens of this district are deeply angered by the oppression of Chinese pharmacies. We should request that your council deeply understand the people's sentiments and consider the merchants' difficulties, quickly recall the order, and cancel the new tax. For water and electricity, those that have been cut off should be restored immediately, and we hope that you will not adopt defensive measures in the future to avoid accidents. Correspondingly, we hereby send this letter, hoping that you will investigate and handle it and reply accordingly." Addressed to the French Municipal Council.

Planning the Construction of a National Hospital; Progress is Quite Smooth

Jiao Yitang, member of the Central Committee and Director of the Central National Medicine Museum, is enthusiastic about promoting the cause of traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacy, working diligently and sparing no effort. Recently, in view of the fact that foreign countries are studying traditional Chinese medicine, and that the Chinese people should preserve and promote this inherent national essence, he intends to plan the establishment of a National Capital Hospital, gather experts, and focus on research. He has already received the support of famous people at home and abroad. Jiao came to Shanghai on the 13th of this month with his secretary Zhang Xijun, spared no effort, and actively carried out this initiative. Upon hearing the news, the Shanghai medical and pharmaceutical groups were excited by Jiao's enthusiasm for promoting traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacy. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Shanghai Municipal National Medicine Association, Shenzhou National Medicine Society, Chinese Medical Association, Chinese Medicine Association, and Shanghai Municipal National Pharmacy Association, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association, Traditional Chinese Medicine College, Chinese Medical College, and New China Medical College jointly initiated a welcome meeting at the Ningbo Association, attended by more than 500 people. Details have been published in previous newspapers. Now, in order to thank the medical and pharmaceutical groups for their feelings, Jiao specially hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road the night before last, entertaining more than 200 famous people in Shanghai. During the banquet, Director Jiao delivered a speech, saying that traditional Chinese medicine is developing overseas recently, and the research of Chinese people should not lag behind. In the future, he hopes that comrades in the traditional Chinese medicine community will use scientific methods to organize traditional Chinese medicine so that this inherent national essence of our country for thousands of years will not be lost. The capital is where Chinese and foreign people watch, and the center for promoting academics, so it is necessary to create a national hospital to promote the achievements of ㊅ medicine and popularize the belief of the masses. Being ambitious and far-reaching depends on this. However, the National Hospital is still a pioneering initiative in our country. The scale is complete and it takes a lot of planning. I sincerely hope that famous people at home and abroad, and the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacy community, will support it so that it can be realized as soon as possible, and that Hong Chinese medicine and pharmacy will be more effective. Yitang knows that this matter is huge and cannot be done by one person alone. Now, with Wu Xun's hard work in running schools, I seek sympathy and unity to seek welfare for the masses. I am determined to do this and will not slacken." Then, guests Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Yu Xianglin, Gong Xingzhai, etc. gave speeches successively. Afterwards, Rong Zongjing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Qu Wenliu, Zhu Ziqiao, Chen Guangfu, Wang Boqi, Zhuang Dezhi, Lin Kanghou, Qian Xinzhi, Chu Huiseng, Fang Jiaobo, Chen Chuxiang, Shen Zhongfang, Zhu Ziyun, Ding Zhongying, Ding Jiwan, Wang Zhongqi, Zhu Hegao, Xia Libin, Gu Weichuan, Zhu Binglu, Tong Baoqing, and Ling Xinjia were publicly elected by the attendees to be responsible for soliciting donations separately.

### The Public Concession's Water Rate Changed from 75% Discount to 80% Discount

The Company Wanted to Change to 85% Discount; The Board of Directors Rejected It

The water rate set by the Public Concession Waterworks has been paid at a 75% discount since April 1935. At the end of 1935, the Municipal Council agreed with the company that changes to the discount would only be considered after one year. At the end of last year, the company petitioned the Municipal Council to allow them to charge at an 85% discount, the reason being that the expenses were huge and they wanted to ensure that the water supply could continue without danger. These expenses could not be saved. The Municipal Council's Public Works Committee put it forward for discussion at a meeting on the 11th of this month. The director of the council's Finance Office suggested that it could only be changed to an 80% discount. If the company's expenses were still insufficient after changing to an 80% discount, it should be made up from the company's reserve fund. Mr. Pearson, the company's manager and chief engineer, attended and explained the reasons for the price increase, saying that the exchange rate has fallen recently, resulting in increased expenses, and that several machines must be added this year. In addition, the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association instructed the company to install individual water meters in each building. In the future, the amount of water consumed by tenants will inevitably decrease day by day, and the company's losses will be more difficult to make up for. If the water price is changed to an 85% discount this time, it may not be necessary to increase the price in the future. After discussion, four recommendations were passed as follows: ⑴ The committee, because the Shanghai Waterworks Company has made every effort to save expenses within the feasible range, allows the company to charge users at an 80% discount instead of a 75% discount based on the amount of water recorded on each user's water meter according to the company's original price list from February 1, 1937. ⑵ According to the agreement between the Municipal Council and the company, if the situation changes in the future, the amount of the discount may be discussed at any time. ⑶ When the board of directors rejects the company's request to change to an 85% discount, pay attention to the company's expenses, which have increased significantly from 1933 to 1937. ⑷ In the future, the water meter issue will be studied in detail by the departments in charge of the Municipal Council and the company's personnel. The above four recommendations were approved by the Municipal Council's board of directors at a meeting on the 20th of this month, and the Waterworks Company has also agreed.

### Reasons for the Verdict in the Bao Gang Case

Extrapolating Yang Yuehua's Bazi; Her Age Was Already Over Twenty Years Old

The case of lawyer Bao Gang and his servant Zhang Xinkui, who were previously sued by Cui Changgui, the bodyguard of the detective team leader of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, at the Local Court for seducing his fiancée Yang Yuehua, has been ruled by the Criminal Court of the court that Bao Gang and Zhang Xinkui are innocent, and the plaintiff's incidental civil suit is dismissed. The case once caused a sensation in society, so we looked up the full text of the verdict as follows: "Omitted above" Reasons According to Article 1 of the Criminal Law, the act of punishing is limited to the provisions of the law at the time of the act. Furthermore, Article 293 of the Criminal Procedure Law also stipulates that if the act is not punishable, a verdict of innocence shall be rendered. In this case, the defendants, etc., were prosecuted by the prosecutor for the crime of disrupting the family based on Article 140, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Criminal Law. Although the seduced person, Yang Yuehua, stated that "I am 21 years old this year, I was born in the year of the dragon, on the fifth day of the sixth month of the Republic of China's 5th year. Cui Changgui is my cohabiting fiancé. On May 11, Bao Gang seduced me to the Dafang Hotel, and Zhang Xinkui took me to the countryside, then to Zhang Qinghong's house in Chuansha District for more than a month. I still came to Shanghai once in between." However, the crimes of seduction and abduction in the Criminal Law both require the inducement of men and women under the age of 20 to leave their families as a key element of the crime. Upon reviewing Yang Yuehua's Bazi, which was jointly filed by her father Yang Nanqin and her fiancé Cui Changgui on November 14, it stated that "Bingchen, Xinmao, Jiachen, Guiyou". According to the almanac, it was indeed born on the fifth day of the second month of the Republic of China's 5th year at You hour (5-7PM). Moreover, Yang Buqin stated at the case that "I don't remember whether it was January or June." This kind of Bazi was clearly recognized by Cui Changgui in court during the debate, so Yang Yuehua's age should be based on this Bazi. It should be in February, and the claim of June is difficult to adopt. Her age counted to February 5 of this year (25th year) is already over 20 years old. The alleged inducement on May 11 of this year, the seduced person Yang Yuehua is already over 20 years old, so there is no crime of disrupting the family. In addition, there is no other evidence to prove that the defendants committed a crime. The crime is not established, so a verdict of innocence should be rendered. As for the part of the incidental civil suit, since a verdict of innocence has been rendered, it cannot be relied on and the plaintiff's suit should be dismissed. According to the above, the judgment should be made in accordance with Article 292, Paragraph 1 and Article 507, Paragraph 1, the first paragraph of the Criminal Procedure Law as the main text (omitted below).

### The Overseas Chinese Silk Industry Association in Osaka Remitted Money to Relieve the Suiyuan Disaster

The United Relief Association of Charity Organizations in Shanghai received a telegram from Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong, the standing committee members of the association, yesterday, stating: "United Relief Association of Charity Organizations on Yunnan Road, Shanghai. According to reports, the survey personnel in Wuchuan arrived on the 11th and started working on the same day. In order to help the disaster victims urgently, we have also hired five cadres in Peiping to join the various survey teams in order to expedite the process. Wang Lifu and Meng Xianhai joined Taolin, Jia Guangya and Sun Wenxiao joined Xinghe. The members left Ping on the 12th and arrived in Sui on the 14th and were dispatched separately that night. Secretary Zhang Zibin will work in the office for the time being and will be dispatched to the disaster area when necessary. We hereby report this to you for your information. Feng Xuefen, Yang Mingsheng, bowing." The association also received a letter from the General Consulate in Kobe yesterday, stating: "Recently, the Overseas Chinese Silk Industry Association in Osaka has submitted a donation of 100 yen to relieve the victims of the Suiyuan disaster. Please remit it. Correspondingly, we have purchased a Mitsui Bank draft and sent it with the letter. Please check it and send back the receipt for our reference." Addressed to the Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association. Yesterday, the association continued to receive 1,000 yuan from the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association, and 13 large boxes of medicines were donated by the Red Cross Society. Because the association saw that the victims of the Suiyuan disaster were in urgent need of assistance, in addition to sending a follow-up letter urging those who had pledged donations but not yet paid and those who had not yet pledged to pay, it also dispatched accountants to visit members of various organizations and individual members who had pledged donations in order to raise 80,000 yuan as soon as possible to remit to Sui to provide relief to the victims.

### Xian Shi's Female Tea Waitress Sues Zhu Rongkai

Abandoned After Cohabitation and Giving Birth to a Child; But Medically Difficult to Prove

Zhu Rongkai, a Jiangxi native residing at 38 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road, was sued civilly by Lu Lanfeng, a 24-year-old Jinhua woman from Zhejiang who used to work as a female tea waitress at Xian Shi Amusement Park, through a lawyer at the First Special District Court. The complaint stated that the virgin came to Shanghai last July to find relatives, and she met Zhu. After they slept together at the Xizang Hotel on Yiqiaxiang Road, they rented a house at 10 Yongyeli, Weihaiwei Road to live together and then chose an auspicious day to get married. Later, she gave birth to a child, named Wenying, but Zhu then hesitated to move forward and abandoned her. She is suing him for abandonment under Article 54, Item 1 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Huang Risheng summoned him once, Zhu Rongkai admitted that he shared a room with the plaintiff at the Xizang Hotel, which was voluntary. He said that Lu Lanfeng (also known as Zhou Suzhen, Bailanhua) was a worthless romantic woman working as a tea waitress at the Amusement Park, and there was no renting a house to live together. The child was not his. The trial was postponed, and both parties were asked to have their blood types tested to see if Wenying was Zhu's bloodline. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang opened Criminal Court No. 8 for trial. Defendant's attorney Lin Yingqing and Zhu came to court. Zhu resolutely denied that Wenying was his. However, the Zhenru Forensic Institute examined Zhu Rongkai's blood type as O, and Lanfeng's blood type as AB. There is a possibility of having a child with blood type B like Wenying, but current science cannot determine for sure that he is the father. Furthermore, according to Zang Boyong, president of Boyong Hospital, who testified that Lu Lanfeng had consulted him for illness before and was not pregnant. Where did the child come from? The court hearing ordered the suspension of the trial and asked the plaintiff to file a lawsuit to confirm paternity.

### An Iron Wheel Flew Off the Roof and Split Open a Small Worker's Skull

Died on the Spot; The Scene Was Too Horrific to Bear

The Fufeng Flour Mill on Moganshan Road recently hired artisans to repair the exterior of the factory, which had been corroded for many years and was unsightly. Unexpectedly, at about 9 PM last night, while the artisans were working on a bamboo scaffold several feet high, an iron wheel from the mill's wheat grinding machine suddenly flew off the roof and hit a small worker's head. His skull was split open, and blood and brains gushed out, killing him instantly. His body also fell to the ground, the scene was too horrific to bear. The other workers immediately reported to the factory and called an ambulance. Because he had already died, they sent the body to the coroner's office and reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate the cause of the machine wheel falling off in detail in order to investigate.

### The Municipal Council Revised the Traffic Regulations

The Municipal Council has revised some of its traffic regulations. One of the additions requires drivers to reduce their speed when approaching pedestrian crossings and, if necessary, stop their vehicles to allow pedestrians crossing the street to pass without obstruction. Another regulation stating that "vehicles used by the Fire Department or the Police Department have the right to pass through the streets first when heading to the scene of a fire, riot, or other emergency" has been amended. A paragraph has also been added regarding vehicles following behind, stating that "no vehicle shall overtake another vehicle that has stopped or is moving at an intersection in order to compete to go forward." The regulations regarding parking have also been revised. One of them states that "if a driver stops on the roadway for passengers to get on or off, or for any other reason, he must keep the left side of the vehicle as close as possible to the curb on the left side of the street, except when complying with signals given by a police officer." The locations where long-term parking is allowed have been increased and decreased in several places. All the revised articles have been published in the council's English Gazette issued today.

### The Yangtze River Water Level Drops Daily, Sichuan River Navigation Interrupted

Minsheng Company Invites Experts to Chongqing to Discuss Relief Measures; Downstream Fully Loaded Vessels Can Only Reach Wuhu; Six Companies to Increase Shallow Water Fees by 10% Next Month

As the Yangtze River water level drops daily, the Sichuan River becomes increasingly depleted. After the Zhi Guang Shipping Company's Lao Shu Tong vessel ran aground and sank at Qingtan, the Yichang-Chongqing route was blocked. Minsheng Industrial Company divides the Yichang-Chongqing route into three sections. To maintain shipping, it has invited shipping experts to Chongqing to discuss relief measures. Although navigation between Shanghai and Yichang continues as usual, fully loaded vessels can only reach Wuhu. China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin, among other six companies, convened a joint meeting. It was decided to increase shallow water fees by 10% starting from the first of next month. The announcement stated: "The Yangtze River water level is rapidly receding. Our company's fully loaded cargo vessels can only sail as far as Wuhu. Vessels sailing downstream must also travel empty to Wuhu. All passengers and cargo rely on extensive lighterage and transshipment, incurring significant losses for our company. It has been decided that starting from February 1, 1937, all cargo destined for ports above Wuhu will be subject to an additional 10% shallow water fee, bringing the total to 50%. This is hereby announced."

### Dismissed Policeman Chen Anong Steals Handgun from the Public Security Bureau

Daring to Openly Sell It to Others; Fortunately Arrested by the Police After Investigation

Chen Anong, a 27-year-old from Hangzhou, previously served as a police officer, No. 2225, at the Fourth District First Precinct Mongolian Road Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. Due to poor character, he was dismissed by his superiors in May of last year, and Chen became unemployed and impoverished. At 3:00 AM on the 8th of this month, Chen went to the Mongolian Road Police Station to borrow money from former colleagues. At the time, the station had

Three Handguns and Eleven Bullets. Chen seized the opportunity, stole them, and fled over the wall. By the time the police station discovered the theft, Chen had already escaped. Afterward, Director Cai reprimanded the officer in charge of the station, and the patrol leader, Liu Sun (a Cantonese), was detained. After stealing the three guns, Chen hid at No. 8, Lane 1292, Qiujiang Road. Recently, Lu Maomao planned to purchase one gun from Chen for 40 yuan, and they agreed to meet at

No. 20 Avenue Edward VII Hongxiang Hotel, Room 19, to complete the transaction. Chen invited Yongren Wang Afa and Zhenjiang native Cai Arong, who brought one gun and three bullets. However, the plan was discovered by Chief Detective You A'gen, Detective Feng Xiushan, and Detective Wu Shoushan of the Old Zha Police Station. They rushed to the scene at 1:00 PM the previous afternoon and arrested Chen, Wang, and Cai. One handgun was found on Wang Afa,

Three Bullets. Subsequently, two handguns and eight bullets were found at No. 8, Lane 1292, Qiujiang Road. All three guns were marked with the words "Shanghai Public Security Bureau," confirming that they were the stolen goods from the Mongolian Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. Police attorney Ru Baoyi explained the situation and charged Wang Afa and Cai Arong with public endangerment under Article 187 of the Criminal Law. Chen Anong, because the

Gun Theft Location was within the Chinese area, was requested to be transferred to the Municipal Police Bureau for interrogation and handling. Subsequently, Liu Bingyuan, the detective squad leader of the Municipal Police Bureau, surrendered to the court, requesting that the suspect Chen be transferred. Wang and Cai were also requested to be transferred together for questioning, and that the guns and bullets be transferred as well. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confession and delivered a court sentence, sentencing Wang Afa and Cai Arong to one year of imprisonment each. Chen Anong and the two other suspects, along with the guns and bullets, were handed over to the officers of the Municipal Police Bureau for further investigation and interrogation.

### Lawsuit Over the Estate of the "Manure King"

Ma Lushan to Receive One-Fifth of the Estate

After the deaths of "Manure King" Ma Fuqi and Ma A'gui's sister, the entire estate was managed by the eldest son, Ma Hongkui. The second son, Hongsheng, and the third son, Honggen, did not intervene. After Hongkui's death, his wife, Chen, filed a complaint in the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division, accusing her husband's brother, Honggen, and her husband's concubine, Wang A'da, of seizing the entire estate, claiming it was worth four million. After an accountant's investigation, it was found to be only 800,000.

Through mediation, the estate, plus one public account, was divided into four equal shares, and the case was settled. However, Ma Hongkui had a mistress, Qin, who had a son named Lushan, who is now eleven years old. After Hongkui's death, his wife denied that Lushan was her husband's biological son. Therefore, Qin, as the legal guardian, filed a

Suit for Confirmation of Identity with the Second Special District Court's Civil Division on behalf of her son, Lushan, against Ma Hongkui's wife, Ma Chen, son Ma Lushen, daughters Lu Ying, Lu Zhen, etc. After three trials, it was confirmed that Ma Lushan was Ma Hongkui's heir. Ma Qin, along with her son Ma Lushan, filed another suit in the Second Special District Court's Civil Division on August 10 of last year against Ma Chen, Ma Lushen, Lu Ying, Lu Zhen, etc., seeking the partition of the estate. The subject of the lawsuit was the

One-Fifth of the One-Quarter Share That Ma Hongkui Should Have Received from the 800,000 of Ma Fuqi and Ma A'gui's estate. They also applied for litigation assistance, which was approved. After paying 800 yuan for the surety from a woolen shop to cover litigation costs and accountant fees, Judge Ma Yishu repeatedly held hearings and announced the conclusion of the arguments. Yesterday morning, Judge Ma Yishu presided over the

Civil Division Ruling, that Ma Lushan should receive one-fifth of the estate in Ma Hongkui's name. The litigation costs were to be borne by the defendant. It is said that after learning of the loss, the defendant will file an appeal after receiving the judgment. Whether this is certain remains to be seen.

### Detectives, Posing as Rickshaw Pullers, Capture Extortionists

The Two Criminals Took a Large Envelope, Beaming with Joy; Unexpectedly, Detectives Surprised Them and They Were Arrested

Li Ming, from Wuxing, Zhejiang, lives in the French Concession and recently served as the head of the patrolmen in the Water Patrol, with a monthly salary of 50 yuan. He is addicted to gambling, especially dog racing. Recently, he lost a significant amount and could not make ends meet, so he had a sudden idea. Knowing that Zhou Renci, the principal of Huang Zhou Elementary School at No. 250 Ruijin Road, had some savings, he colluded with Zhang Daming, from Yunnan, residing in Dongxi Huade Road, to

Write a Threatening Letter at home on the 17th of this month. The letter was mailed, demanding 1,000 yuan from Zhou, otherwise they would resort to extreme measures. The next day, they thought that the letter was not effective enough and wrote another letter, enclosing a bullet. They instructed Zhou to seal 1,000 yuan in legal tender in a large envelope around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. He was to bring it to the corner of Dongxi Huade Road and Zhaofeng Road, No. 227, next to a foreign goods store. There was a telephone pole

With a Red Paper Strip attached as a marker. The letter and the money were to be inserted into a gap, and someone would come to retrieve them. If he did not comply, they would give him a "steel hygienic pill" to drink. This letter was not sent by mail; it was personally delivered by Zhou Renci's old servant, Zhang Shi. Zhou received two threatening letters and was very frightened, so he took the letters to the Jiaxing Road Police Station to report them. Detective Jin Yangwu and Cao Jinbiao were dispatched, disguised as clerks at the foreign goods store, to

Observe the Situation at the door. Zhou Renci, carrying a large envelope that looked like 1,000 yuan in legal tender, took a rickshaw, pulled by detective Liu Zhongcheng disguised as a rickshaw puller, to the telephone pole with the red paper marker. He got off the rickshaw, inserted the money into the gap, and pretended to return to school in the same rickshaw. After waiting for a while, Zhang and Li arrived one after another. They looked around and saw no police officers. Zhang stepped forward and took the large envelope from the gap in the pole,

Beaming with Joy. Just as they were about to escape, detectives Jin and Cao rushed forward and arrested Zhang Daming and Li Ming. They were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division Three. Concession attorney Zhang Tianyin detailed the case and presented the two threatening letters for inspection, requesting a strict investigation. Subsequently, both Chinese and foreign detectives and the victim Zhou Renci, and the maid Zhang Shen, explained what had happened. When questioned, the two defendants stammered and claimed that they were temporarily confused and resorted to this bad plan, requesting leniency. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to be remanded in custody to await sentencing.

### Junpu Bureau Orders a Giant Dredger from Germany

Reuters, Shanghai, 21st dispatch. The Junpu Bureau recently signed a contract with the Schihew Company of Ilbin, Germany, to build a giant dredger at a price of 231,700 pounds. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai within two years. It is said that after the ship is built, it will be the largest dredger in the world, weighing about 10,000 tons and equipped with a main engine with 7,000 horsepower. It can dredge about 30,000 tons of mud per day and carry 4,000 tons of mud. According to the plan of Dr. Charter, Lai, the chief engineer of the Junpu Bureau, the ship is prepared to be used to dredge the sandbar at the entrance of the Yangtze River to facilitate the passage of large ships sailing in the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated that 40 million tons of silt will be dredged from the entrance, which can increase the water depth by 9 feet. Thus, ships with a draft of 33 feet can pass through without hindrance at more than half tide. The Junpu Bureau's existing dredger, Jingxi (which arrived in Shanghai from Germany in 1935), was also built by the same company.

### The Robbery at Shenxin No. 9 Factory Was Committed by Insiders

The Gatekeeper, the Warden, and the Cargo Manager Were All Detained

Zhu Hanbo, the Chinese detective chief of the Gordon Road Police Station, previously arrested seven robbers from Jiangbei: Ma Da, Gu Naifu, Ji Zhenhua, Chen Huisheng, Wang Mengshi, Song Delong (also known as Xiao Sizi), and a 13-year-old girl, Wang Xiaolaohan, etc. Two handguns and ten bullets were seized and sent to the Special Court for investigation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. At around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, Detective Zhu continued to arrest two accomplices, Li Yunzhang from Tianjin, Yang Yaozhong from Chongming, and Zhang Ronghua from Wan, at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory at No. 140 Macau Road. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division Eight. Police attorney Li Zhishan stated the case and requested detention until the 25th, to be tried together with Ma Da and others. Upon investigation, it was found that the defendants Li Yunzhang and others were related to the case of the robbery of 1,800 yuan in wages at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory on December 4 of last year. Because Li was the gatekeeper of the Shenxin Factory, and Yang Yaozhong was the cargo manager of the factory warehouse, and Zhang was a handyman, all of them were suspected of collusion in the robbery. It was requested that they be detained. Judge Fu reviewed the report, briefly questioned Li and the other three, and ordered a change. The case will be retried on the 25th.

### The Ministry of Communications Rectifies the Broadcasting Industry in This City, Suspending the Broadcasting Rights of Eight Radio Stations

Due to Poor Equipment and Failure to Obtain Licenses

The Broadcasting Association Has Appealed to the Ministry of Communications for Relief

In order to rectify the wireless broadcasting industry in this city, the Ministry of Communications recently issued a special order to cancel the broadcasting rights of eight radio stations, including Dunben, by the end of this month, due to poor equipment. After receiving the order, the Private Broadcasting Radio Stations Association of this city held a special meeting and submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications for relief. The details are as follows:

Suspension of Broadcasting Rights of Eight Radio Stations

The Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications stated that the wireless radio station business in this city is very developed, but there are many aspects that need to be corrected and rectified. After review, it was specially instructed that the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of this city forward the order to the Broadcasting Industry Association, ordering the Dunben, Huaguang, Huiling, Zhou Xieji, Xinsheng, Tongle, Shiyin, and Anding radio stations in this city to stop broadcasting by the end of this month. As for the reasons for the Ministry of Communications' suspension of the eight radio stations this time, it is heard that on the one hand, the number of radio stations in this city is too large, affecting radio waves, so it is necessary to reduce the number of radio stations in this city. Secondly, because two of the eight radio stations have special circumstances that require them to be banned, the remaining six radio stations are ordered to stop broadcasting because their equipment is simple and there are too many deficiencies.

Broadcasting Industry Association Expresses

Yesterday, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications stated that the ban on Dunben and other radio stations was indeed a fact. According to the person in charge of the Broadcasting Association, the association has received reports from various stations requesting to forward the request for relief. The reasons for the removal this time are mostly that they have had a license for many years but have not obtained a new one, the equipment is simple, and the broadcasting interferes with other stations. According to the term of the permit, it is indeed only six months, but there are still many private radio stations that have not obtained a license. Previously, in the 24th year of the Republic, the association collected documents and guarantees from various member radio stations for collective application, but at that time, the Telecommunications Bureau stated that there was no appropriate method and only ordered the documents to be stored, which cannot be regarded as the negligence of the radio stations. As for the issue of equipment, there are no explicit regulations in the regulations on the ban of private radio stations, and the equipment drawings of each radio station must be submitted for review in advance. After approval, they can be built, and then they must be submitted for inspection and verification. Only after passing the inspection can they be allowed to broadcast. If there are instructions to add equipment, they will also be followed. However, private radio stations cannot be compared with state-owned equipment due to capital relations. Regarding the issue of interference, the power of the eight radio stations is not strong, and one of them has not yet found a suitable location since last year due to the demolition of the building and has not yet broadcast. It seems that there is no possibility of interference. Considering the above situation, there is no intention to violate the regulations. The authorities may have misunderstandings. Moreover, private radio stations rely on business for maintenance, and manufacturing equipment cannot be done without thousands of gold. Once they are ordered to stop broadcasting, their equipment cannot be transferred like other businesses. How can they properly manage it? The association has submitted the above situation to the Ministry of Communications and the Central Broadcasting Industry Guidance Committee, requesting that they be considerate of the difficulties of the business and first issue equipment standards so that private radio stations can know what to follow and reduce losses.

Investigation of Broadcasting Personnel Completed

In view of the fact that the level of all broadcasting personnel in the radio stations in this city varies greatly, and the choice of topics has a great impact on the thoughts and lives of the masses, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau recently prepared a form, distributed for investigation, and paid the most attention to the education level. The results showed that among the 457 people, 159 came from private schools, accounting for one-third of all personnel in the broadcasting industry; 99 came from elementary schools, accounting for one-fifth of all personnel, of which 74 graduated from elementary school; 120 came from middle schools, accounting for one-quarter of all personnel; 18 received university education, accounting for one-twenty-fifth of the total; and 61 were illiterate and uneducated. Therefore, the education level of the broadcasting personnel in this city is not uniform, and the authorities believe that it is necessary to find a way to provide relief.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau Increases Ham Freight

Freight Rate Increased by 40 Cents per Piece

The Association Requests to Charge at the Old Rate

The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau has changed ham, which was originally listed as fourth-class cargo, to third-class cargo for transportation fees since the 26th year of the Republic, resulting in an increase of 40 cents per piece. The Ham Industry Association of this city received reports from its members yesterday and sent a letter to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, requesting that the fees be charged at the original rate. The letter stated, "Dear Sirs, we have recently learned from our member, Bei Wan You Quan Ham Store, that they received a notice from the Hangzhou Transportation Company that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau raised the freight rate for ham by one level on January 1 of this year, changing it to third class (originally fourth class), increasing the freight rate by 40 cents per piece compared to the previous time. Our association was shocked to receive the report. Ham is originally a rural sideline product. At a time when the rural economy is collapsing, the government should support and promote agricultural products. Now, if the transportation price is arbitrarily increased, it is tantamount to directly increasing the cost of the item and indirectly affecting sales. This facility is deeply inconsistent with the original intention of the authorities to develop agricultural products on a daily basis. We dare to submit the facts and hope that your bureau will still charge the freight for ham according to the original price of fourth-class cargo. We will be very grateful and hope for a reply to avoid misfortune."

### Two Money Shops and Huafeng Company Announce Closure

The Two Shops Are Liquidating Separately

Huafeng Will Discuss the Aftermath

Xinsheng News Agency reports that Yuanzi Money Shop Xiehe Qinji, Hengzi Money Shop Fengrun, and Huafeng Business Company announced their closure the day before yesterday and separately entrusted lawyers to liquidate. The details are as follows:

Xiehe Qinji

Xiehe Qinji Money Shop is a Yuanzi-numbered shop in Shanghai, located at No. 13 Ruyi Li, Henan Road and Beijing Road. The manager is Luo Guixiang, and the associate is Liu Yusheng. After the reorganization two years ago, the capital was 140,000 yuan. Now, affected by the economic downturn, deposits have gradually decreased, and loans that have been issued are difficult to recover. Due to the closure of Huafeng Business Company, it had no choice but to announce its closure the night before yesterday and entrusted lawyer Dai Menghan to liquidate. The announcement stated, "According to Xiehe Qinji Shop, the shop is temporarily unable to circulate due to the impact of the market, and is forced to stop business for liquidation, entrusting a representative to handle it. Therefore, the representative is announcing that all holders of the shop's promissory notes should return the notes for the original basis. All depositors and debtors should register at the office within 14 days for verification and liquidation. Please do not delay. This is hereby announced."

Runfeng Money Shop

Runfeng Money Shop is a Hengzi-numbered shop in Shanghai, located at No. 23 Ruyi Li, Henan Road and Beijing Road, with a capital of 30,000 yuan. The manager is Wang Yuncheng, and the associate is Chang Baichun. Its main business is to receive secret-marked coupons, etc. Now, affected by the closure of Huafeng Business Company, it could not be maintained the night before yesterday and had no choice but to announce its closure. It entrusted lawyer Shan Yuhua to liquidate. The announcement stated, "According to the manager of Runfeng Money Shop, the shop has been affected by the economic downturn and will stop business from today. The liquidator owes debts to various people. Please trouble your lawyer to represent and notify all creditor and debtor accounts to register within 14 days, bring the proof to the office for registration. Debtors are also limited to 14 days to come and repay, and take a receipt. Please do not delay and be sued. Therefore, a special representative notice is given as right."

Huafeng Company

Huafeng Business Company is located at No. 15 Ruyi Li, Henan Road and Beijing Road, with a capital of 100,000 yuan. The manager is Wang Yuncheng. Its business is the same as a silver company, and it also absorbs deposits. Now, due to business failure, it announced its closure on the 20th and entrusted lawyer Shan Yuhua to announce at the door, "According to the representative of the above-mentioned party, the company is currently affected by the changes of debtors and has to temporarily stop business. Once the shareholders' meeting decides whether to resume business, a formal announcement will be made. We ask your lawyer to represent the announcement. The lawyer has checked and verified the facts and hereby publishes the announcement on January 20, 1937."

Reasons for Closure

The Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from the Qian industry yesterday that Luo Guixiang, the manager of Xiehe Shop, and Wang Yuncheng, the manager of Runfeng Shop, jointly opened Huafeng Business Company. Its business is to receive bank secret-marked coupons and operate securities trading, agency insurance, etc. Now, due to business failure, it has a large debt and cannot be maintained. Xiehe and Runfeng shops were implicated and closed at the same time, but it has nothing to do with the entire finance.

### The First Day of the Exhibition to Support Sui and He Was a Great Success

The Collection Exhibition of Greeting Cards by Mr. Yu Dani, the Director of Education of the Louis Elementary School on Tianzhutang Street outside the New North Gate of this city, opened yesterday. The content was rich, and the layout was elegant. More than 10,000 kinds of artistic greeting cards were divided into 16 categories and displayed in 10 classrooms, which was a feast for the eyes. Although the weather was gloomy and cold, the visitors kept coming. The cartoonist Mr. Lu Shaofei lingered and appreciated in the venue for three hours and still sighed that it was like riding a horse and looking at flowers and could not fully appreciate it. A Japanese scholar, Mr. Jian Saburo, also bought a ticket to enter the exhibition. He was very moved to see the tragic situation of the wounded soldiers in Suiyuan. He expressed his extreme dissatisfaction with the brutal and cruel behavior of his country's warlords, believing that China has a long culture, vast land, abundant resources, and a large population. China and Japan can only achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity if they are friendly and work together. If they use military aggression, carry out bombing, and kill the same kind, it will not only cause Chinese resentment but also be intolerable to heaven. After appreciating it, Mr. Jian expressed his admiration for Mr. Yu's artistic cultivation. After learning that Mr. Yu was a Catholic monk, he wrote the words "The Realm of Happiness and Joy" and left it as a souvenir. In addition, many people from Henan Zhumadian Bishop Wang Bolu and the news and art circles came to visit. Dr. Yu Bin, the Bishop of Nanjing, sent a special telegram from Guangzhou to congratulate the success. Fei Huaiyong, the Dean of Guisui Public Hospital, also sent a letter of congratulation and thanked on behalf of the wounded soldiers in the hospital.

### The Shanghai Pisi Tobacco Industry Association Submits to the Guangdong Provincial Government

Please Order the Repeal

of the Tobacco Floss Transit Tax

The Shanghai Pisi Tobacco Industry Association believes that since the unification has been completed, the national government stipulates one tax for one item, which should be implemented to comply with the decree and reduce the burden. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Guangdong Provincial Government yesterday, requesting that it order the repeal of the tobacco floss transit tax in Guangdong Province. The original submission is as follows, "For the matter of earnestly requesting an order to repeal the tobacco floss transit tax in Guangdong Province, in order to alleviate business difficulties and comply with the decree, it is reported that the association has repeatedly received letters from various members stating that merchants are engaged in Fujian tobacco floss, which is collected from Yongding, Fujian, and transferred through Dabu, Chaozhou, etc., due to geographical advantages. It has already paid the special tax in Yongding, the place of origin. In the past, Chen Jitang, the governor of Guangdong, was extremely greedy and levied heavily on everything. When tobacco floss was transported through Guangdong, he extorted exorbitant taxes, called transit tax. At that time, due to the special circumstances in Guangdong and Guangxi, there was nothing that could be done. Now that the unification has been completed, the Guangdong provincial tax administration will follow the decrees of the central national government and stipulate one tax for one item. Since the tobacco floss has been taxed in the place of origin, the above transit tax should no longer be levied. However, the actual collection is still the same and has not been repealed. Since the establishment of this industry in recent years, it has been ravaged by the communist bandits internally and attacked by the prevalence of cigarettes externally. With internal and external difficulties, even if the government abolishes the harsh taxes and increases the donations and taxes, it is still feared that it will not be able to maintain it. If it is burdened again and again, it will inevitably be on the verge of extinction. Moreover, the sales of tobacco floss are extremely small, and what is the benefit to the provincial treasury from the dribs and drabs of transit tax revenue? It only makes the transport of goods obstructed and the business is more difficult. The association requests that it be forwarded to the Guangdong Provincial Government, which will order the immediate repeal of the transit tax to alleviate business difficulties and comply with the decree. It is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted."

### Renji Hospital December Report

Renji Hospital recently released its report for December of last year, stating that there were 12,985 outpatient visits, 337 new inpatients, 6,871 inpatient days, an average of 440 patients fed daily, 48 male suicides, 41 female suicides, 242 emergency surgical cases, 61 emergency surgical cases due to factory accidents, 271 patients sent by the Public Concession Police, 40 patients sent by the French Concession Police, 16 patients sent by the Chinese Public Security Bureau, 33 deliveries, 13,322 prescriptions filled, and 443 X-ray examinations.  These statistics show that the hospital's work is progressing according to the usual seasonal patterns. Specifically, the number of inpatients increased from 323 in the previous month to 337 in December, and the number of inpatient days increased from 6,434 in November to 6,871 in December. Emergency surgical cases due to factory accidents increased by 20 percent, which may be attributed to the increased industrial activity in Shanghai. Another lamentable phenomenon in December's work was the increase in female suicides, from 33 in November to 41 in December.  One encouraging aspect of the work is the increase in deliveries, with 33 recorded in the past month.  The obstetrics department is developing so rapidly that, if this growth continues, a pre-registration system for inpatient deliveries will be necessary in the future. Looking back on the past month, the hospital particularly feels the need for charitable organizations to accommodate impoverished patients after their discharge. It is distressing to see patients who have been cured discharged from the hospital only to have no home or job, especially during these cold winter months. This social issue is a serious problem for the hospital's work, although it is not entirely related to the hospital's core mission. Strictly speaking, the hospital's work is done once the patient is cured. However, if the patient is unable to obtain adequate means of living after leaving the hospital, the hospital's achievements in curing them will be rendered useless. The hospital sincerely hopes that charitable organizations can provide assistance in this regard. December, being a month with a strong Christmas atmosphere, saw the hospital receive special donations and assistance, enabling it to provide excellent care for patients throughout the past year. The hospital is deeply grateful. The children in the pediatric ward were able to enjoy gifts and candy. The hospital hopes that the harmonious atmosphere that filled the hospital during Christmas was able to provide real comfort to patients and staff, and to create a happy and lasting memory for them.

### Robbers Posing as Telephone Inspectors Commit Robbery

At approximately 9:45 AM yesterday, five robbers suddenly arrived at the home of Mr. Zhang, the owner of the Daye Printing Company located at No. 305 Pingliang Road.  They falsely claimed to be telephone company inspectors to gain entry to the house, and then proceeded to rob it. Two of the robbers were armed with Brownings, and one carried a Mauser pistol. They first confined Mr. Zhang's family members, and then forced them to hand over the keys to important boxes.  They began searching and looting, and left with their loot after about half an hour, escaping in a chartered car that had been waiting by the roadside. By the time the victim chased after them, the car was long gone, and the car's license plate number and other details could not be determined. Upon checking the losses, they amounted to over three thousand yuan. He then filed a detailed report with the Yulin Road Police Station, requesting an investigation and pursuit. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched detectives to investigate the scene and inquire about the appearance of the robbers and the color of the car, in order to track them down.

### Shui Mu Workers Brawl at Xi Jinji Construction Plant

Wang Wenkui Makes Every Effort to Provide Medical Attention

At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, a brawl broke out between the plasterers and carpenters employed by the Xi Jinji Construction Plant at the intersection of Zhizaoju Road and Hui Ning Road in the Nanshi area. The fight was triggered by a minor dispute over wood planks. As a result, Shi Folang (a 40-year-old man from Chongming, also known as Monk) and Wang Wenkui (a 39-year-old man from Pudong) both suffered severe head injuries from axe wounds. Upon learning of the incident, the local police station dispatched officers to the scene and detained 18 workers involved in the incident, including Yan Shukui and Li Liu'er, for interrogation. The injured were taken to the Shanghai South Bethel Hospital for treatment. However, Shi Folang, the carpenter, eventually succumbed to his head injuries and excessive blood loss.

### Fire on Tiantong Road

Old Clerk Burned

At approximately 8:30 PM last night, a fire broke out at Wanheng Sauce Garden, located at No. 856 to 858, at the intersection of Tiantong Road and North Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession. The flames quickly spread through the roof, becoming uncontrollable. During the fire, an old clerk from the sauce garden, a Ningbo native, 44 years old, escaped from the inferno but suffered burns to both legs, which were quite severe. He was subsequently transported to Baolong Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The fire department dispatched a fire engine to the scene and extinguished the blaze after some time. As a result, two buildings were destroyed by the fire.

Both Sides Suffer Injuries

Luo Zhongxiu, a dockworker for the Sanbei Company at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, accidentally bumped into patrolman Yang Wanlin while carrying goods from a ship to the wharf at 1:00 PM yesterday, leading to a verbal altercation. The patrolman then reprimanded the dockworker, and the dockworkers gathered a crowd to make trouble for the patrolmen. The patrolmen did not back down either, and a fierce fight ensued. As a result, Luo Zhongxiu was seriously injured on the workers' side, while Yang Wanlin suffered a head injury on the patrolmen's side. Wang Dekun also suffered injuries to his right hand and face. The incident was reported to the Pudong Branch Bureau, which dispatched detectives Li Xinheng and police chief Zhang Zifang to investigate the scene.

### Wu Qigen and Others Convicted of Illegally Detaining Female Guide

Zhang Ying, a female employee of the Tiansheng Guide Agency located in the Gongqing Building on Hankou Road, was summoned by Wu Qigen, Chen Yonglin, Zhang Asheng, and others to Room 110 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road at 6:00 PM on the 13th of this month. They made all sorts of jokes and attempted to assault her, causing Zhang to cry out in distress. Wu and the others, considering this to be inauspicious, invited the manager of the guide agency, Li Lili, to come and threatened her with dangerous words, attempting to extort twenty yuan. Li managed to report the matter to the Lao Zha Police Station, which ordered detective Song Wenqing to arrest Wu and the other three. The details of their delivery to the First Special District Court for interrogation have been previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court declared the judgment in the First Criminal Court.

He consulted numerous Chinese and foreign doctors, but with little success. Upon hearing of Dr. Zhao's expertise in treating various ailments, he sought treatment from him and was cured within a month. His health has improved daily, and his spirits are high. Dr. Zhao truly deserves to be called a renowned physician of our time.

### Italian Consulate Requested Ban on Abyssinia Film

Shanghai Grand Theatre Ignores Request Based on Central Inspection Approval

Authorities Sent Police to Suppress Concerns of Disputes

The Shanghai Grand Theatre, located at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road, began showing the "Abyssinia Film" at 3:00 PM yesterday. The film had already been approved and licensed by the Central Film Censorship Committee, so there were naturally no major issues. However, the Italian Consulate in Shanghai learned of this and requested that the authorities ban the showing. The authorities reasoned that since the film had already been approved by the Central Film Censorship Committee, there was no reason to prohibit it. However, given the previous incident where a certain film shown at the Paris Theatre on Avenue Joffre (now Huaihai Road) had angered Italian expatriates, who then seized and burned the film, causing a major dispute, they were concerned about a similar incident occurring. Therefore, Liang Fuchu, the chief of the North Station Branch Bureau, led eight police officers to suppress any potential unrest inside and outside the theatre. A reporter from Xin Sheng She, who attended the 3:00 PM showing yesterday, learned that the film was produced by the Soviet Film News Factory. One part depicted the customs and geography of Abyssinia, including its various resources such as gold mines, silver mines, coal mines, and oil fields, as well as important military locations and the harsh conditions of Abyssinian farmers. The other part depicted the Italo-Abyssinian War that began on December 5, 1934, with the Italian army launching attacks from Eritreli and Samali, and the Abyssinians resisting with swords, spears, sticks, and clubs against airplanes and artillery, including the Italian bombing. The film was entirely a newsreel.

### Woman Abuses Child to Death

Police Prosecute Based on Neighbor's Testimony

Hearing Adjourned for Rescheduling

Ji Longcai, a 42-year-old man from Zhenjiang, married a woman surnamed Wang (39 years old this year) from Yangzhou. Ji works as a cabin officer on a Taikoo Company ship in Hubei. Wang lives in the east wing of A-10 Tongan Lane, Lao Yong'an Street, in the French Concession. Because she only gave birth to daughters and not sons, she adopted a one-year-old boy as her son five years ago, naming him Fuxiang. He is now five years old. However, Wang has a violent temper and does not treat the child well, often abusing him. Starting on the 8th of this month, the child suddenly developed a fever and rash. Instead of seeking medical treatment, Wang beat the child when he cried, and even used a red-hot iron to burn his right leg. As a result, the child's illness and injuries gradually worsened, and he died at 2:30 PM on the 15th of this month. Wang then planned to buy a coffin and hastily bury him. Neighbors, feeling that this was unjust, reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. They arrested Wang and sent the body to the coroner's office. Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court conducted an autopsy and determined that Ji Fuxiang died from the burn injuries. The details have been previously reported in this newspaper. The police have now sent Wang to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Sun Pengham presided over the First Criminal Court to hear the case. Lawyer Yuan Jiahong of the police department prosecuted her for the crime of causing death by injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Law. Witnesses, including the landlord Zhu Run'an and the neighbor Sun Yuming, testified about the defendant's abuse of the child. When questioned, Ji Wang denied abusing the child, claiming that he had measles for seven days and that she was unable to afford medical treatment, seeking ineffective folk remedies until he died. She also retained a lawyer to defend her. After reviewing the evidence, the court adjourned the hearing to 2:00 PM on January 28th. The defendant was returned to custody.

### "A Rare Phenomenon in Twenty Years"

— Jianping

The international edition of this newspaper on the 19th published alarming news about the naval arms race among various maritime powers, stating that the current surge in warship construction is unprecedented in the last twenty years. Even the "naval hegemon" Great Britain has a staggering budget to build ninety-nine ships. It is no wonder that the general public is taken aback by this news. Although 1936 did not truly become the year of a second world war as predicted by some, the world is shrouded in war clouds, and the increasing antagonism between the democratic and fascist camps, as well as the feverish expansion of armaments by various countries, have made people worry about the coming year of 1937. Although at the beginning of the new year, Eden echoed Baldwin's statement that "this year is a year of peace," saying "we would rather have butter than guns," the expiration of naval reduction agreements, coupled with the thickening atmosphere of gunpowder stirred up by the "three giants," has forced even Great Britain, the old empire that repeatedly declares peace, to build more warships in order to consolidate its naval empire. Therefore, although the phrase "a rare phenomenon in twenty years" sounds a bit alarming, it has become something expected. Let us take a look at a piece of gossip news in the important news section of this newspaper on the 14th, which will make you feel that these "rare phenomena" are "not so rare." The news is as follows:

"Krupp Steel Company shareholders can receive a dividend of 4%, which is an unprecedented phenomenon for the company in the last twenty years. The company's total capital is 160 million marks. In the fiscal year 1934-1935, the profit was 9.7 million marks. In the fiscal year 1935-1936, the profit was 14.4 million marks, accounting for 9% of the capital. In addition to the 4% dividend distributed to shareholders, the remaining 5%, or 8 million marks, is used as a reserve fund. However, the increase in the company's reserve fund this year is actually 20 million marks, indicating that the actual profit is more than 14.4 million marks..."

What kind of guy is Krupp Armaments Factory? It is believed that everyone knows. It is German, no, it is the world's largest arms dealer. During World War I, it fattened its big belly by sucking the blood of kind people of various races on the battlefield. Today, in the new year of 1937, this bloodsucker has announced its total profit. The profit amount of 14.4 million marks is believed to be no small amount, not to mention that the "actual amount" is even more than this number. From this profit amount, we can probably smell a gunpowder smell that is stronger than that of 1936. The tragic scene of skulls piled up like a mountain is vaguely in front of people again. Who is the manufacturer of war? Here, his hideous face is fully revealed. The little dove of peace disappeared and sank in the fog of poison gas, never to raise its head again!

Let us think about it carefully. The so-called "twenty years" does it not mean that the world has now reached the time of 1914, when the great powers divided up the colonies? There has been no such good business in the past twenty years. That is because the European war was exhausting. Now it is 1937! Yes! Twenty years! The call for the redistribution of world colonies has been shouted out and partially implemented by the "three giants." How can we blame the Krupp Company for making a lot of money and daring to say that it is a "rare phenomenon in twenty years"? Is this not the sinister laugh of people who profit from war?

War, it seems, is very difficult to avoid. Not only are the major powers, who shout "peace" in their mouths, preparing for war so frantically, but the "three giants" have already reached the point of "death if they do not fight." Therefore, if we, the weak and small nations, want to long for peace, the first thing we must do is use the war of resistance to eliminate the ambitious war of aggression. "A rare phenomenon in twenty years," that's right, perhaps the weak and small nations' war of resistance against the god of war will be a rare phenomenon in history!

### Breaking the Ice for Fish

— Li Xuan

Snow was falling, and the sky was dawning dimly.

The village was quiet. The snow silently turned the fields into a silvery, shimmering expanse. The wind gradually died down. People were going to the market, the sky still gloomy.

The vegetable vendor carried two large baskets of cabbage, the snow crunching under his feet. Under the white felt hat with large earflaps, a square, purplish-black face was revealed. He walked for a while, blew his nose with his large hand, took a breath, blankly looked at the distant snowy path, changed the carrying position of his load, and then walked step by step.

In the sorghum stalk fence at the head of the bridge was a small, two-room restaurant built of reeds. Thick gray smoke billowed from the chimney on the roof. The wooden door was half open, and a waiter who had just woken up came out to hang the white wooden sign, which read "Meat and Vegetable Noodles, Sesame Seed Cakes". After hanging it up, the waiter looked into the distance. From across the bridge, the intermittent sound of a bell drifted over, crisp and clear, cutting through the freezing morning wind. A merchant from the city, out collecting debts, jumped down from the back of his donkey, huddled in a ball.

"Hey, excuse me, could you tell me which street Zhang Junqing lives on in the village?"

"East Street, black gate, across from the pharmacy. Won't you eat something?"

"No, I'll eat when I come back after settling the accounts."

"Going to the countryside to collect debts in this weather."

The waiter said to himself, watching the merchant enter the village on his little black donkey. He also idly

## Page 18

went back inside.

People were fetching water by the river, and the sky was brighter. The charcoal factory with the iron gates was also opened. The cook carried a pair of buckets down the slope, humming, "Tenth and twelfth lunar months, so cold, a widow's heart, half empty..." A black dog followed behind him, sniffing at the wet spots on the snow, suddenly, a series of sounds, like the breaking of glass, came from the center of the river, and the dog howled, and the cook looked over there, muttering to himself:

"Breaking the ice for fish in this cold weather, good lad!"

An old man and a young man lit a fire on the riverbank. The large firewood burned in two-foot-high flames. In the center of the river on the thick ice, there was a fellow with an ice drill, drilling holes in the ice. He had drawn a three-foot square circle on the ice, and the dazzling one-foot-high drill bit was moving back and forth on the ice surface. After a while, a large piece of ice was suddenly knocked far away, tinkling like rain, but it was blocked by the fluffy snow. The ice was slowly broken, and a square of emerald water flowed under the thick ice layer. The old man guarding the fire saw the ice-drilling man standing there wiping sweat, and knew that he had broken through, so he said:

"Second brother, is it through?"

"It's through!" he said, picking up the ice drill and walking towards the fire.

The young man in his twenties standing opposite the old man was now stark naked, with a long-haired old sheepskin coat draped over his shoulders. He had tied a leather pocket, as large as a pair of shorts, around his legs. The old man took a pig bladder soaked in pig's blood and wrapped it around his hair. He himself put on small iron rings on the thumb, middle finger, and ring finger of his right hand, each extending an inch-high, very sharp curved knife from his nails. He squatted by the fire, picked up the big-bellied black porcelain wine bottle, swallowed a few mouthfuls of liquor as if drinking cold water, wiped his lips, and said to the ice-drilling man with the sheepskin coat:

"Second brother, shall we go down?"

With a flash, he threw the sheepskin coat on the snow, took a big step to the ice hole, and put his hands on the ice layer that had been cut without any sharp edges, and jumped down. The second brother quickly ran over and looked down, leaning over the ice hole with both hands holding the ice drill, watching his brother move in the freezing ice water with his generations of experience. The old man guarding the fire also came over at this time. He loved his son who was suffering from the cold ice. He had experienced the skin-splitting pain of that kind of life in the ice water, and he trembled as he exhorted the older son:

"Second, be careful, be careful, how is it?"

The son waved his hand and walked to the side of the hole. A hand suddenly stretched out of the water, and a large fish weighing six or seven pounds was thrown onto the snow. The fish jumped around anxiously, panting, and soon became quiet. The old man happily grabbed the fish, walked back to the fire, and put it in the large leather bag filled with water.

At this time, the young man who was as strong as a leopard had climbed out of the ice cave, and the older brother put the sheepskin coat on him. Everyone forgot that snow powder was still floating in the sky. They ran, and when they got close to the fire, the older brother stuck the ice drill in the ground and helped his younger brother to untie the cumbersome fish pocket. The father used a dry cloth to wipe his body, wiped him dry, and applied the liquor. He squatted by the fire, rubbing the skin of his body with his hands as he roasted.

When the father stood behind him and untied the pig blood bladder on his head, the thin ice that had condensed on it fell down like broken glass. The three men looked at the fish pocket, full of fish, and smiled silently. The older brother was taking off his cotton coat, preparing to jump into the ice cave for the second time to fill the other two fish pockets. The father said:

"Enough to buy a bushel of millet."

The two sons said at the same time:

"It's the end of the year, and many small debts have not been repaid yet."

### The Magic of Photoelectric Cells (Electric Eyes) (Part 2)

— Special

The earliest photoelectric cells had only a metal plate that served as one electrode when exposed to light. Part of it was housed in a metal container, forming another electrode, with the space in between filled with air at atmospheric pressure. Today's photoelectric cells use a photosensitive metal plate, or a layer of gold foil inside a glass bulb, as the first electrode, and another metal plate as the second electrode. Both electrodes are sealed in a glass tube, with the air density inside being less than one millionth of the initial photoelectric cell. The electricity generated by that photoelectric cell is extremely minute. If not for the later invention of the triode vacuum tube, which gradually reached perfection and amplified the minute electrical power enough to operate relays or indicators, the cell could never be applied as it is today.

In factories that mass-produce goods, the cell can be used to count items. Counting red-hot steel ingots passing through a certain temperature with the human eye would surely cause dizziness. If a mechanical counter were used, the heat would destroy it. At this point, only an "electric eye" can count the number, distinguish colors, and separate sizes and types. The "electric eye" can compensate for all the shortcomings of machinery. The "electric eye" can temper steel bars at a certain temperature, heat them to a certain red color, take them out of the furnace, and perform other industrial uses.

Both the transmitting and receiving ends of a telephoto machine rely on the power of photoelectric cells. The first telephoto machine, invented by an obscure German experimentalist named Nipkow in 1884, was merely a very crude mechanical spinning disc. It then stagnated for forty years before the combined application of the "electric eye" was known. Initially, it could only produce a very faint image in the laboratory, but after rapid progress, it became an almost continuous picture in the human eye. The latest and most complete telephoto machine was invented by Zworykin, and it is a photoelectric cell like the human eye. That battery, like the human eye, can emit a complete image, but this is the effect of electron scattering. At the receiving end, it converts the electron impulses into light and shadows, and simultaneously presents the entire image.

Sound movies use a precisely measured beam of light emitted from an exciter lamp. That light passes through the sound track on the film according to optical laws and shines on the photosensitive surface of the cell. Because the amount of light contacting the sound track is consistent and unchanging, the parts of the sound track that cannot be transmitted vary with the amount of light shining on the cell surface. The appropriately measured stream, after being amplified, is sent to the sound reproducer, which emits various sounds.

The tunnel under the Hudson River in the Netherlands uses photoelectric relays to count the number of cars passing through the tunnel. The Ambassador Bridge in Detroit, USA, also uses this method to count vehicles crossing the bridge. Large department stores in New York City use photoelectric cells for advertising. When pedestrians approach the glass window displaying goods, they interrupt the light beam, and the relay immediately activates, and an advertisement appears inside the window for a few minutes. When there is no one around, the advertisement does not light up, which is also an economical method. Another use is as a smoke indicator and recorder in a factory, thus preventing fuel waste. Dangerous machines, using photoelectric cell methods, can protect workers from accidental danger. If a worker is too close to the machine, interrupting the light beam, the machine will immediately stop moving or emit a warning sound. Skyscrapers can use photoelectric cells to make elevators go up and down automatically, without the need for a operator. Rooms storing flammable materials are equipped with "electric eyes," and they can detect even a wisp of smoke, immediately sound an alarm, or spray fire extinguishing liquid. Schools and libraries, with photoelectric cells, will automatically turn on the lights when the room gets dark. Paper mills with photoelectric cells can limit the thickness of the paper, and if the thickness is excessive or insufficient, or the paper surface is broken, it will issue a warning. It can operate traffic lights at road intersections. It can check the quality of eggs and sort eggs of different sizes one by one. There is no telling how many more uses there are for this kind of delicate work. (The End)

It's hard to meet and even harder to part. I never imagined I'd be seeing you off today. The willows along the ten-mile long embankment follow the wind. All blowing towards the departing traveler's face. Thinking of you, a handsome young man untainted by the world. Song Yu is amorous and delights in recovering himself. Heroines in women's attire and beauties in boudoirs. Who wouldn't admire your talent. Who knew you, wouldn't dislike this humble and poor woman. Entering a humble dwelling, you bestow an appreciative eye. Affection is heavy as a mountain, kindness like the sea. Helping with studies like severing metal, joyfully cultivating. Unexpectedly, there is illness in the high hall requiring decoctions. No one to serve day and night. Therefore, I, urged by telegrams, hasten the journey. Lingering farewell words at the long pavilion. Only hearing that, the Yangguan three stacks sing a sorrowful tune. Shaking hands reluctantly, tears filling the face. I wish you, silently pray that the gods will protect and assist. That the northern hall daylily returns early in spring. I wish you, to cherish yourself when the weather is cold or warm. That the traveler's hardships will feel especially cold. I wish you, a good match destined by the old man under the moon. Plan early and seek out a matchmaker. I wish you, not to break off correspondence. Don't let this slave girl sleep restlessly. Know that I, sit in a sorrowful city, my heart unsettled. Looking towards you over ten thousand miles of cloud-covered mountains. Although it is, the scenery of home is endlessly good. It can't compare to, the North Sea Tian Tan where you can fully express yourself. But I, do not dislike my meticulous admonishments. Each word contains hardship and soreness. Words reaching deep emotion, the intestines are about to break. Words that are unsaid, difficult to say. Today, tears of longing do not dry.

The Yacheng Harmonica Society of this port is an amateur harmonica music group. Since its establishment, it has been more than a year. The society has broadcasted on major radio stations before, and has received enthusiastic welcome from all walks of life. Later, due to the increasing busyness of the association, it was unable to take care of broadcasting. Now it is heard that the association has received letters from all walks of life requesting it, and has decided to broadcast harmonica music on the Zhongyan (ie China) radio station every Sunday afternoon from 1:15 PM to 2:30 PM, which is a gospel for harmonica lovers.

To whom it may concern, I was deeply shocked to read in your newspaper on the 19th of this month that the "Beilei Troupe" broadcasted singing at the Yadong Radio Station. I have checked that the Bi Xuan Arrow has broadcasted on major radio stations before, but recently I stopped broadcasting for more than a month because of my health. The programs published in your newspaper were not sent by our troupe. If there are any programs to be offered in the future, they will be based on the rules of the troupe, so as to avoid causing misunderstanding. This matter concerns the reputation of our troupe, so I am sending this letter urgently, hoping that your newspaper will correct it. Respectfully, Zhang Mingzong, Beilei Opera Troupe.

### Paramount Celebrates 25th Anniversary with Special Contribution "Perfect Match"

Screening at the Great Light Theater starting today

Mr. Zuke, chairman of Paramount Pictures, has served the company for 25 years and has produced a large number of beautiful films for release to commemorate the occasion. His film "Champagne Waltz" is scheduled to be screened simultaneously in major theaters around the world on the 22nd of this month. The Great Light Theater in this port will also start screening this film today. The film stars three major stars, Klandaish Huasha, Flint McCumolai, and Biggo Okay, and is a musical song and dance romance film comparable to "The Merry Widow." The content includes a mixed performance of jazz music and waltz music, a grand performance of ancient dance art and the new era dance art, and the greatness and novelty of the song and dance scene are indeed worthy of praise, and the acting skills of the two major stars are also quite rare. The picture above is a small portrait of Mr. Zhu.

### Ouyang Feili as a Guide

Miss Ouyang Feili, who used to broadcast on the radio and has now officially joined the film company as an actress, once acted as a guide in Tianyi.

The fact is that "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money," directed by Zuo Ming, is an exposing comedy that tries to collect various phenomena of the current society, and the female guide is a kind of plaything popular in Shanghai nowadays. Their footprints can be found everywhere, whether it is tea houses, restaurants, dance halls or hostels. Therefore, Zuo Ming also included the subject of female guides in "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money". Miss Ouyang Feili and Miss Ning Xuan played the role of the guide, and their acting skills were really good.

### "New Year's Money" - A True Reflection of the Lives of Dance Hall Girls in Small Dance Halls

Under the economic depression and commercial competition in the market, the methods of attracting dance customers in dance halls are becoming more and more strange, especially in small dance halls. In addition to reducing the number of tickets to more than a dozen for one yuan, without additional gifts, it is really miserable for ordinary dance girls to make a living under such circumstances.

In the blockbuster "New Year's Money", recently completed by Star Company, directed by Zhang Shichuan, assisted by Zheng Xiaoqiu and Hu Xinling, and starring more than 20 major stars such as Hu Rongrong, Li Minghui, and Xi Qiuxia, the dance girls in small dance halls are often subjected to the humiliation of dance customers, and there is a very profound description of it!

After a playboy takes a "New Year's money" with the word "happiness" from the hands of a worker, he walks into a small dance hall with a happy mood. The word "happiness" is written on the fighting mouth. 15 dances, nude performances, and mysterious gift advertisements are inside. Smoky, noisy, a playboy dances with an extremely ugly dance girl, constantly watching other dance girls, he finds that a beautiful dance girl is dancing with a dance customer, he drags the ugly dance girl to the front of the beautiful dance girl, pushes the ugly dance girl to the beautiful dance girl's opponent, pulls over the beautiful dance girl, the opponent takes a look at the playboy's appearance, has to endure, and then looks back at the ugly dance girl, then gives up dancing and leaves.

The playboy embraces the beautiful dance girl and dances wildly, with frivolous gestures. The beautiful dance girl is extremely painful. After dancing for a long time, the beautiful dance girl is exhausted and takes the opportunity to wipe her sweat. The playboy steps on her foot painfully. The beautiful dance girl asks the playboy to be careful, which provokes the playboy's anger. He slaps the dance girl, and knocks over the table. The dance hall manager hurriedly comes out to apologize and promises the playboy to immediately stop the beautiful dance girl's business. The beautiful dance girl sees that her business has been stopped and asks the playboy to calculate the dance tickets she just danced. The playboy takes out the "New Year's money" he took from the worker's hand from his pocket and throws it on the ground. The beautiful dance girl endures her anger and picks it up. The playboy grabs her again: "One yuan for fifteen dances, you only danced fourteen dances just now!" He embraces her again and dances frivolously.
