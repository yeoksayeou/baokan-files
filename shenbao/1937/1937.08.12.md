### Our Country Has No Choice But to Resist Japanese Aggression with Sacrificial Blood

Being Bullied by Japan Has Reached the Point of Intolerability; Wang Zhengting Delivers a Speech in New York

He continued, saying that we respect the opinions of experienced people from all countries. It is only natural for a just person to resist those who infringe upon their clothing, houses. If a country is invaded, it should also resist in the same way. In the time of the weak and declining Qing Dynasty, China was almost divided. The Xinhai Revolution changed the situation. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said in his will that he devoted himself to the national revolution for forty years, and his goal was to seek freedom and equality for China. 400 million Chinese people are sacrificing blood, time and property to achieve this goal. The Chinese people are enduring sacrifices and working hard, but we only want countries to understand the righteousness held by China and do not want to ask for direct assistance from other countries, because launching a war of self-defense is our duty. Only as the founding fathers of the United States said, we will answer everything with our lives, property, and honor. (10th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)

### Yu Fu River Breached Yesterday Morning at Songjia Yao Village, West of Jinan

Residents of the Entire Area Fled to Sleep on the Grand Embankment - Flood Waters Flow Eastward, Pouring Directly into Low-Lying Areas - Jinan City May Not Be Affected

[Jinan] The Yu Fu River, located 35 miles northwest of this city, is a major channel for flood discharge from the northern side of Mount Tai. It flows north to Beidianzi, 40 miles northwest of this city, and empties into the Yellow River. Recently, due to heavy floods from Mount Tai, the river water has risen sharply, and the Yellow River's water level is also unprecedentedly high. This has caused the estuary to be blocked and unable to discharge properly. Furthermore, the people's embankment on the east bank is too low. As a result, a breach occurred at Songjia Yao Village, 35 miles west of this city, at 3 a.m. this morning. This reporter personally went to investigate. The sound of water, like ten thousand horses galloping, could be heard several miles away. The breach is about 20 meters wide, with a very rapid flow and waves over 10 feet high. Residents of the entire Songjia Yao area barely escaped with their lives and are sleeping on the grand embankment. The floodwaters are flowing eastward, pouring directly into the low-lying areas north of the commercial district of this city. The city itself may not be affected. According to villagers, this river has never breached before. The water level of the Yellow River from this city to Qihe is also very high, with the water level reaching within one meter of the top of the embankments at low points. The water level at Luokou has reached 32.57 meters. A drop in water level may be seen this afternoon. (Special dispatch from the 11th)

### Nanjing Municipal Government Well Prepared for Extraordinary Times

Mayor Ma's Talk on Various Ongoing Preparations - Anti-Enemy Support Association Publicly Soliciting Donations of Gold and Silver

Nanjing dispatch. With the current situation reaching a critical juncture, the municipal government is actively carrying out all preparations. Mayor Ma Chaojun gave a speech yesterday, describing the various preparations being made in this city in detail. He earnestly hopes that citizens will maintain their livelihoods, uphold a calm determination to fight under the central government's national policy, cooperate to resist the enemy, and avoid being misled by rumors, which could lead to self-inflicted disruption. The key points of the speech are recorded below:

Comprehensive Preparation

Mayor Ma first expressed his boundless indignation at the violent Japanese invasion of Peiping and Tianjin, and the brutal killing of our compatriots. He then declared that various necessary measures have been successively implemented and actively expedited for completion in this city during these extraordinary times. In terms of air defense, both passive and active measures have been fully prepared. There is no cause for concern. Underground shelters are also being quickly equipped. However, given the large number of citizens, to ensure thorough preparation, we also hope that citizens will pay more attention to this matter. It would be best if there were privately operated underground shelters to supplement any shortcomings in the government's capabilities, and jointly promote safety. The organization of defense groups is composed of trained civil servants and strong men, under the command of the competent authorities. The number of personnel is very large, and the organization is extremely strict and well-connected. Should an alarm be raised, it is believed that the defense groups will be able to quickly respond to their assigned duties, sufficiently reducing the occurrence of disasters.

No Concern for Food Supply

Regarding the food supply, the municipal government has carefully planned and consulted with various relevant agencies to develop sound methods and make sufficient preparations. The Farmers' Bank is also assisting in handling all related matters. Jiangsu is a rice-producing region. Jurong and Lishui are located close to Nanjing and transportation is convenient. With sound planning and proper preparation already in place, and the source of supply secure, there should be no problem with the people's food supply in the future. According to yesterday's report, 3,000 dan of rice arrived, of which 1,000 dan were consumed, leaving a stockpile of 2,000 dan. More will be stockpiled to meet emergency needs. Regarding the stabilization of commodity prices, the municipal government has also established a Supply Committee to comprehensively prepare, ensuring that all major necessities can be adequately supplied. Therefore, we are striving to facilitate the transportation of goods purchased from the business community. In terms of the economy, we have also consulted with the banking community. The government will be responsible for providing guarantees to facilitate mortgage loans, thereby assisting with cash flow.

Do Not Believe Rumors

Recently, unscrupulous individuals have taken the opportunity to spread rumors. Carelessness can easily lead to deception. Citizens are urged to pay close attention, avoid being misled by rumors, remain calm, and respond with composure. As the capital is strategically important, the government will bear full responsibility for promoting all aspects of safety. We hope that everyone will maintain their livelihoods and cooperate to resist the enemy. Finally, Mr. Ma issued many warnings regarding the unreasonable aggression of the violent Japanese. He stated that the militaristic and war-mongering Japanese, disregarding international principles, are seizing North China, acting unilaterally. However, upon closer examination, their domestic economic collapse is imminent, and public grievances are mounting. We have a good grasp of our final victory. Furthermore, the violent Japanese acts of aggression are not being tolerated by international observers. “Those who commit many injustices will destroy themselves.” Their actions will be condemned by thousands and will surely be subject to severe sanctions by countries around the world.

Anti-Enemy Association Fundraising Regulations

The Fundraising Department of the Capital's Anti-Enemy Support Association has formulated a guideline to implement fundraising activities, which will begin immediately. Fundraising will be divided into: ㊀ Long-term donations: Patriotic donation boxes will be set up at the entrances of various entertainment venues and major streets, allowing people to make long-term voluntary donations. ㊁ Temporary donations: Each person donates one day's income, which is temporarily collected and submitted to the state. ㊂ Fixed donations: All salaried employees of various agencies, schools, hotels, etc., will donate according to the income tax regulations promulgated by the central government, with the heads of each unit responsible for collection. ㊃ Activity donations: To save time and avoid abuses, the association will formulate supplementary donation methods for restaurants, theaters, and amusement venues. Students and Boy Scouts will no longer engage in sporadic fundraising. ㊄ Newspapers collect donations on behalf of the association: Following past practices, they will publish advertisements soliciting donations from citizens, and the donations will be submitted to the designated bank for transfer to the association's management committee for safekeeping. ㊅ Solicitation of gold and silver donations: The department publicly solicits gold and silver donations from all sectors of society. Regarding the organization of fundraising teams, agencies and organizations will serve as units. Each agency or organization will form a large team, with the head or responsible person serving as the team leader. Each team will be divided into several sub-teams. The association will print donation booklets, symbols, and flags for distribution for identification purposes. The collected donations will be submitted to the team leader daily, who will transfer them to the designated bank the next day for submission to the association's management committee for safekeeping. Fundraising teams must maintain close contact with the military police, and the military police will provide assistance or convenience at any time and strictly prohibit impersonation.

### Shandong Province's Yellow River Flooding Presents a Dangerous Situation

Breaches in the People's Embankments on the Northern Bank Upstream - Luokou Water Level Exceeds Historical Records

Jinan dispatch. The water level of the Yellow River has been rising continuously for several days. Throughout Shandong Province, the upper, middle, and lower reaches are overflowing their banks. Alarming waves are pounding the shores and filling the embankments. Numerous hazardous conditions and leaks have appeared everywhere. Flood control personnel have been tirelessly working day and night to plug them. However, breaches have suddenly occurred in the people's embankments within the main dikes on the northern bank upstream in Shouzhang, Yanggu, and Fanxian counties due to the overwhelming force of the water. The people's embankments on the northern bank of the Yellow River, from Huangying in Fanxian to Liuqiao in Shouzhang, have a smaller people's embankment in front of them. A breach suddenly occurred in the Baitang small embankment yesterday. The breach is approximately one kilometer wide. Water entered the area between the large and small embankments, flowing underground. The lower end of the small embankment is blocked, preventing drainage. Five outlets were dug upstream of Wulizhuang to try to discharge the water. However, due to the surging water, it is still difficult to discharge, so the water level continues to rise, severely eroding the large embankment with wind and waves. The embankment body is sinking, making rescue difficult. As a result, more breaches have occurred, totaling three breaches. One is located at Wangji on the border between Shouzhang and Yanggu, with a breach approximately 200 meters wide. One is located at Liuqiao in Shouzhang, with a breach 80 meters wide. One is located at Dawangzhuang in Fanxian, with a breach approximately 120 meters wide. The water depth at each breach is approximately five or six meters. The three breaches total over 400 meters in length, with over 20% of the water flowing through them. However, the water flow at the breaches is very rapid, and the expansion is also very fast. The roots of the large dike on the northern bank are showing signs of subsidence, extending to the south gate of Fanxian. According to subsequent reports, the water overflowing from Wangji and other places has converged with the Jin Di Jia River and flowed to Nantai in Shouzhang, where it has split into two streams. The westward stream has reached the area above the Daokou flood control unit, while the eastward stream continues to flow into the main river. Wherever it passes, it submerges the dike roots, creating a vast expanse of water. Countless ponds have been lost. The Guagutai dike in Shouzhang has cracked and split, with a length of over three zhang. The dike is still intact as a result of rescue efforts. The Director of the Repair and Prevention Office, Wang Kairu, has not only telegraphed the chief of the division to direct soldiers and laborers to strictly guard the northern and main dikes to ensure safety, but also telegraphed a report to the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Han Fuju, and the Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Kong Xiangrong, on the 8th regarding the various hazardous conditions and rescue efforts.

The water level of the Yellow River in Shandong Province, in the upper, middle, and lower reaches, has been rising sharply for several days. The water level at Luokou on the 8th was 31.77 meters, exceeding the highest historical record. Therefore, the situation is extremely critical. Chairman of the Provincial Government, Han Fuju, personally inspected the water situation in the Luokou area at around 6 p.m. that afternoon, directing the defense. The heads of all counties along the river have gone to the dikes to supervise workers in the defense. It is hoped that no accidents will occur.

Furthermore, the Yellow River is experiencing significant floods, with all reaches in Shandong exceeding historical records, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Fortunately, through the efforts of river workers and the heads of counties along the river who led workers in rescue efforts, safety has been maintained. Although the water level at Lishengcun in the upper reaches showed a drop on the 10th, the middle and lower reaches are still experiencing significant floods. The water level at Luokou is high, reaching 32.02 meters. All the weirs and dams are submerged, but due to strict precautions, there should be no accidents. In the middle reaches, many weirs and dams in Jiyang and Qihe have been submerged and lost. Furthermore, the Luojia Zhuang dike in Jiyang is waterlogged, and the back-river dike and inner harbor are being protected. The Yellow River in Shaanxi Province continues to rise, with the flow rate exceeding 10,000 cubic meters per second. After receiving a telegram from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the Shandong Repair and Prevention Office has issued orders to all areas along the river for strict precautions. (10th)

The Pinghan express train heading north from Hankou via Zhengzhou should, according to the schedule, depart from Zhengzhou at 3 a.m. The hotel servant who bought my ticket returned and told me that this train would be delayed today, probably not arriving in Zhengzhou until 6 a.m., telling me to sleep in a little longer, saving myself from getting up too early. At the same time, he said that express tickets to Baoding had been suspended, and starting today, the Pinghan express train would terminate at Shijiazhuang. Originally, the delay was not a big deal to me, because the travel experiences of the past few days had already given me this impression: "Delay is a matter of course!" But the express train not going to Baoding was a bolt from the blue to me.

At 6 a.m., I went to the station to inquire whether the section between Shijiazhuang and Baoding was still open to traffic. The deputy stationmaster told the reporter: "There are still passenger trains available, but the departure time cannot be determined and needs to be checked in Shijiazhuang."

The train, which was said to arrive at 6 a.m., did not pull into Zhengzhou Station until 8:15 a.m. The reporter stood on that gray old platform, watching rows of covered freight cars and coal cars constantly departing. On those coal cars, many poor men, women, old people, and children, not knowing where they were going, were crowded in the open air. Their rain-soaked clothes and bedding were spread all over the iron sheets. Their withered yellow faces and ragged clothes were truly a tragic picture of refugees. The hardship of the people in the Central Plains is truly heartbreaking.

The station was particularly chaotic. On the platform for the Longhai westbound train, piles of bedding boxes and trunks were stacked up like mountains. On the platform for the Pinghan northbound train, there were also piles of various electrical wires and iron grabs. This is a sign of the coming of a great era. Passing over the Yellow River, looking up at the ever-changing sea of clouds, and looking down at the rolling turbid currents under the Yellow River Bridge, these are all symbols of the coming of a stormy era!

The Yellow River Railway Bridge is nine li long and is considered a major project among railway bridges in various countries. This is the great artery connecting north and south China. Enemy planes have been constantly flying over for reconnaissance in recent days. In order to protect the safety of trains crossing the bridge and avoid enemy sabotage, the authorities are paying close attention to the guarding of the bridge. As the train crossed the bridge, I looked out the window, and at each bridge pier, there were soldiers with guns guarding it. Several light machine guns squatted coldly on the bridge.

After crossing the Yellow River Bridge, a row of beautiful and magnificent distant mountains greeted our train, as if they were advancing in the same direction as us! This is the Taihang Mountains! It is the natural barrier on the eastern side of Shanxi Province. The southwestern side of Shanxi Province has the Yellow River, like a brocade belt, as its natural boundary, and the eastern side has the towering Taihang Mountains. The ancients praised Shanxi as "mountains and rivers inside and out." However, aren't enemy planes frequently flying freely over this beautiful and rich mountain and river in Jin recently?

As the train sped north, I stood alone at the door of the carriage, looking at the light blue Taihang Mountains, and I thought of many things about Shanxi, thought of the crisis in Shanxi after the enemy invaded Suiyuan and Hebei, thought of the importance of Shanxi's position in the future national liberation war, and even more thought of the efforts of the people of Shanxi under the leadership of Director Yan to save the country. The more I thought about it, the more I felt a longing for Shanxi. At this moment, my mind seemed to have already flown to the peaks of the Taihang Mountains, having an intimate and passionate conversation with the compatriots of Jin.

The train passed through small stations along the way, each with one or two rows of covered freight cars and coal cars mixed together, all of which were vehicles that had completed their mission and were waiting for orders. At each station, green-clad brothers were always seen in large numbers. At Anyang (Zhangde), there were many soldiers heading north at the station. Enemy planes had flown to Zhangde and strafed the train with machine guns. Many people at the station were moving branches, which was a kind of camouflage for train traffic. Zhangde is the hometown of Yuan Shikai, and Yuan's tomb is not far from the station, but unfortunately I didn't have time to visit it. Recalling Xiangcheng's power and influence in his time, but now isn't it still the same mound of yellow earth? If Yuan had been more open-minded back then, he probably wouldn't have been absurd enough to prepare for the throne, leaving behind an eternal stain that could never be erased! The Pinghan North Line was the site of many battles during the era of the Northern Warlords and occupied a very important position in the political history of China at that time. Unfortunately, I usually didn't pay attention to modern history during my school days, so many of the changes in the area were confusing, which is a great regret!

Traveling north from Zhangde, there are many coal mines along the way. After passing Shuangmiao, we entered the border of Hebei, and the fields were full of green sorghum, wheat, and cotton, all of which are coveted by the enemy! This made me subconsciously feel more cherished towards this endless wilderness!

As the train approached Guanglu Station, I was standing by the door of the carriage chatting with a certain gentleman from the Railway Bureau who was being transferred to Shijiazhuang. I glimpsed a fairly large-scale coal mine by the roadside. I casually pointed at the coal mine and asked him: What is this mine! Unexpectedly, my question led to a very disappointing story. The fact is this: Mr. Someone told me: "This mine is called the Zhonghe Coal Mine. It has a small railway connecting to the mine. It is quite large. Recently, the two brothers who own the factory were fighting over property. The elder brother hired a Japanese ronin, wanting to use the power of the Japanese to suppress his younger brother, but the younger brother's methods were even 'more clever.' He hired an officer from the Kwantung Army. As a result of the two sides fighting, the ronin was no match for the Japanese Kwantung Army officer with an official position, so the elder brother failed, but the Japanese benefited. Chinese people, alas! They really have no backbone!"

Mr. Someone's words were painful, but there are too many of these hateful phenomena in China today. However, after we sighed with each other, we came to a comforting conclusion that money and status can make people lose their sense of shame and shamelessly serve the enemy, but the majority of Chinese compatriots still have backbone! They won't do that!

It was 10 p.m. when we arrived in Shijiazhuang. I asked the staff in the station and learned that the train to Baoding departs at 6 p.m. every day. The reason why the train schedule was changed like this was to avoid enemy bombing and protect the safety of passengers.

Although arriving in Baoding a day late, being able to sightsee in Shijiazhuang is of course a bit of a gain after disappointment.

August 5th in Shijiazhuang

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Unfortunate Incident at Hongqiao Airport

— Chui

The Sino-Japanese situation is at an extremely tense and serious stage. And this kind of unfortunate incident occurred at Hongqiao Airport, which is a pity. Currently, China and Japan are sending personnel to conduct investigations. As for the truth of the matter, it will have sufficient and fair arguments after a thorough investigation. There is no need to speculate in advance. What is said here is to take the outline of the case and add abstract arguments.

1. Hongqiao Airport is an important military area in western Shanghai, China. Currently, Japanese warships are gathering in Shanghai, and a large number of marines are being assembled. This important area should have the necessary strict precautions. And this time, Japanese military officers ignored everything and entered the important place regardless of their purpose. For the time being, we will not discuss what they intend to do. However, Oyama Isao drove his car straight to the airport, not only refusing to be stopped, but also opening fire. Naturally, there is the possibility of an unfortunate incident.

2. In this unfortunate incident at Hongqiao Airport, two Japanese died and two Chinese also died. One was a soldier and the other was a passerby. According to an investigation by a reporter from a certain newspaper, the Chinese soldier, Shi Jingzhe, was shot twice, both from the back ribs, penetrating the right chest. He was lying 100 meters away from the gate of Hongqiao Airport. The location where Oyama Isao was killed was hundreds of meters away. Therefore, the truth of the incident is very easy to understand. But despite the fact that it is so obvious, in this time when right and wrong are equal to rubbish, the so-called desire to add crime, there is no fear of no excuses, and there is also much to be said with strong words.

3. Since recent years, the disappearance of Japanese personnel for no reason and the false awakening of names have been common occurrences. Even the Lugouqiao Incident last month was initiated by the loss of a soldier. And this time, the death of a lieutenant, regardless of the cause of death or right and wrong, can be used as an excuse. If the Japanese side really had no intention of finding an excuse, then the unfortunate incident at the airport would be very easy to resolve. If there are other plans, then the evolution of this matter is still difficult to predict.

4. In recent years, the political relations between China and Japan have unfortunately experienced major frictions. And the feelings between the people of the two countries are very strong. There is a great sense of hospitality, and there is no discrimination of national boundaries. However, the Japanese government has recently ordered Japanese overseas Chinese to return to their country uniformly, which is clearly a threatening attitude of belligerence towards us. However, under this kind of state, why did Japanese military officers still risk entering our country's restricted area? Then the occurrence of this kind of unfortunate incident was expected.

5. Since the September 18th Incident, the launch of the Japanese aggressive policy has been mostly due to the Japanese army. Therefore, the so-called Kwantung Army garrison has an arrogant attitude. And the navy has nothing to do with it. Therefore, this time the Hongqiao Airport incident was caused by the military officers of the naval landing force. Then how can we know there is no intention of seeking merit and causing trouble? And causing this unfortunate incident. The result of this case is still hard to predict.

According to yesterday's report, the Japanese army concentrated its forces to attack Chahar, and the Ping-Sui Line is tight. A major war is about to break out. Japan has dispatched eight divisions to launch a large-scale attack. The Japanese mainland policy is disregarding fairness and going hard. It can be known that this time the Japanese aggression against our country is a concrete plan. It is definitely not accidental. In that case, our country can only, as Chairman Chiang said, "Fight with the life of the whole nation in order to seek the survival of the country." What else is there to say?

### Britain and Italy Strengthen Diplomatic Relations

Rome Rumored to Establish New Coordination, Mediterranean Agreement Expanded, Britain and France Maintain Cooperation on International Issues

[Rome] According to the well-informed Stampa newspaper, Britain and Italy will soon establish a new coordination to consolidate the relationship between the two countries. The report said that the recognition of Abyssinia's belonging to the Italian Empire in Geneva may become a reality in the first half of September. The negotiations for the new coordination will begin in early autumn, and it is said that the coordination will expand and make more certain the gentleman's agreement on Mediterranean issues, because the points of contact between Britain and Italy are now not limited to the Mediterranean, but will extend to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. (Reuters, 11th from Central News Agency)

[Paris] It is rumored that Britain and France have reached an agreement to recognize Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia and to negotiate with Italy to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean. This news was recently denied by responsible French officials, who said that it is true that the British and French governments are working closely together on various international issues. However, no negotiations have been conducted between Britain and France on the two issues of recognizing Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia and maintaining the status quo in the Mediterranean.

### German Government's Response to Hull's Declaration

Preparing to Submit a Reply, Containing Positive Qualities

[Berlin] Regarding the written statement previously issued by US Secretary of State Hull, (ie, the one issued on July 16th, used to explain the US policy on the situation in the Far East and Europe), semi-official sources here recently declared that the German government will submit a reply with a positive nature in the coming days, and said that they believe that the proposal to amend the current treaty in Hull's statement has concrete value and is very gratified. The German Foreign Ministry, however, expressed doubts, saying that although a certain country theoretically recognizes Hull's proposals of not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and not using force to resolve political issues, in fact, it has no intention of implementing them.

### Germany Strictly Prevents Foreign Spies

Arousing Public Attention, Those Who Willingly Sell Their Country Shall Die

[Berlin] Today, all German newspapers published in large headlines a warning issued by German officials against foreign detectives, in which the names and addresses of several people have been specified. The reason why the German police authorities have made this news known to all is obviously because foreign espionage activities have intensified recently. The authorities warned all German people not to accept any suspicious foreign loans, because exchanging news for money is a common trick of secret intelligence agencies. If anyone does not follow the warning and is misled, they will be charged with treason. The spies whose names and addresses have been announced include the following two people: ㊀ Dubeinle, currently living in Czech Tetz, ㊁ Lamberlet, currently living in Belgium. Both are under the direction of a certain Western European country, specializing in buying informants in Germany to engage in espionage activities. Recently, the so-called "World Intelligence Agency" has published advertisements in German newspapers to recruit interviewers. According to the police authorities, the background of this advertisement is the secret intelligence agency of a certain Eastern European country. The replies to the applications all come from Poland. All German people who know the activities of the above-mentioned detectives should immediately report to the police, otherwise they will be severely punished. (Haitong, 11th)

### German Foreign Minister Leaves Austria and Returns to His Country

[Vienna] German Foreign Minister Neurath, who was resting in the countryside of Vorarlberg, Austria, began his journey back to Germany today, saying that the previous rumor that Neurath's trip was to hold talks with the foreign ministers of Austria and Hungary.

### Duke of Kent of England Visits the Regent of Southern Country

⊙Capital of Yugoslavia The Duke and Duchess of Kent, the fourth younger brother of the King of England, have arrived in Kragujevac, northwestern Yugoslavia, and will be entertained by the Prince and Princess Paul of the Regency. (Havas, 10th from Central News Agency)

### Britain Stops Political Activities of German Overseas Chinese in England

German Secret Organization Discovered, Expulsion of German Journalists Related to This

[London] The reasons for the British authorities' expulsion of three German journalists are still kept secret, but newspapers and diplomatic reporters have been talking freely. The Daily Mail said that Hitler has a secret organization in England, with more than 500 people working in it, and there is an "inner organization" in Bayswater, and the expelled journalists are the leaders of this inner organization, whose job is to scout, follow, and report on the whereabouts of Germans in England. (Reuters, 11th from Central News Agency)

[London] Well-informed sources recently declared that after the German government requested Times of London correspondent in Berlin, Albert, to leave the country by a deadline, the British government had no intention of changing the measures taken to expel the correspondents of the German local newspaper, the Grafner, because in recent months, the propaganda work carried out by Germans in Britain has intensified. The British authorities have no choice but to stop it. In addition, people in the press said that the Times will never send another person to replace Albert. The post of Berlin correspondent will be temporarily represented by Albert's assistant. Before Ribbentrop, a confidant of German Führer Hitler, took office as the British ambassador, he once asked the Times to replace Albert, and the newspaper had refused at that time. (Havas, 10th from Central News Agency)

[Berlin] According to a message published by the Börsen Zeitung, which is usually closely related to the government, the German authorities will take further measures against British journalists stationed in Germany. The newspaper said that the reason why the German government has been delaying until now is that it values the friendship and peace between the two countries, but since Britain has taken the lead in expelling German journalists, the German authorities have no need to worry too much. Therefore, the punishment suffered by Albert, a reporter for the Times of London, will be applied to other British journalists in the future, whose work is not limited to news gathering, but also involves interference in German internal affairs. The Foreign Press Association has convened an emergency meeting to discuss the current situation, and the Times has published an editorial stating that the expulsion of German journalists has nothing to do with their performance of their duties. News reporters are concerned about their own interests and have different opinions, so they can praise or criticize the behavior of other governments and people, or exaggerate or ignore it according to their personal vision. But the actions of German journalists completely exceeded the scope of journalists' duties. Now the German government expels the British journalist Albert because of his harsh views on German politics, which cannot be compared on the same day. (Reuters, 11th from Central News Agency)

### Zionist Congress Passes Resolution Opposing the Partition of Palestine

Authorizes Executive Committee to Negotiate with Britain

⊙Zurich The Zionist Congress passed a resolution today rejecting the Royal Commission's plan to partition Palestine and authorizing the Executive Committee to negotiate with the British government to obtain precise terms for the British government's establishment of a Jewish state. The resolution instructs the Executive Committee not to allow itself or the Zionist movement to be bound in any way during the negotiations. If a concrete plan is obtained during the negotiations, an elected Congress should be convened to make a final decision. The resolution rejects the Royal Commission's claim that the mandate system has proven unworkable and demands its implementation. It also directs the Executive Committee to resist any infringement upon the rights of the Jewish people guaranteed by the Balfour Declaration and the international cooperation of the Mandate Committee. The Congress passed the above resolution by a vote of 300 to 158 and rejected a resolution unconditionally rejecting the partition plan. The debate was intense during the voting, and the vote was postponed twice. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th from the Central News Agency)

### U.S. Considers Banning Scrap Iron Exports

Senator Suggests

[Washington] Senator Nye, Chairman of the Senate Munitions Investigating Committee, stated in the Senate today that several American scrap iron exporters have been shipping large quantities of scrap iron to foreign countries in recent years, especially Japan, making enormous profits. According to reliable reports he received, a certain company in Philadelphia dealing in scrap iron made a profit of as much as $3.5 million last year, equivalent to 150% of its capital. This matter should be investigated, and the export of scrap iron should be banned to prevent other countries from using American scrap iron to make shrapnel shells to attack American soldiers and sailors. (Reuters dispatch of the 10th from the Central News Agency)

### U.S. Warships Leased to Brazil

Argentina Attacks; Hull Explains

[Washington] Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, introduced a bill in Congress last week to allow the U.S. government to lease six U.S. destroyers that exceed the prescribed age to Brazil. Argentine newspapers have recently voiced strong opposition to this bill. Secretary of State Hull addressed reporters today regarding this matter, saying that this proposal does not conflict with international treaties such as the 1936 Naval Treaty, because this proposal contains the following two conditions: ⑴ treatment equal to that of other American nations, ⑵ the United States may take back the leased ships when necessary. Furthermore, these six destroyers will be used for commerce, not for war. (Reuters dispatch of the 10th from the Central News Agency)

⊙Argentine Capital The Argentine newspapers have unanimously condemned the U.S. government's current plan to lend six warships to Brazil. La Nación stated, "The Brazilian government's borrowing of American warships to expand its fleet will immediately alter the current naval balance among South American countries. We do not understand the reason for this. Although both the U.S. and Brazilian governments have stated that the borrowed warships are purely for training naval personnel, this argument can only be valid if the United States possesses a large number of warships, so that when other South American countries make similar requests, the U.S. government can satisfy them one by one. This is not in line with the current situation." La Prensa stated, "This action is a major mistake and clearly contradicts the peace aspirations repeatedly expressed by American authorities. It is hoped that the U.S. Congress and public opinion in both the U.S. and Brazil can urge their respective governments to carefully consider or correct this."

[Moscow] A dispatch from Irkutsk in Pravda today stated that seventy-two East Siberian Railway employees, accused of being Trotskyites, engaged in sabotage, espionage, and disruptive activities, and under Japanese instructions, destroyed a train on March 19, killing 14 and injuring 30, have now been executed after trial. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th from the Central News Agency)

### British Navy Enhances Air Combat Strength

[London] According to a naval correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph," after the British government placed the aircraft equipped on British warships under the direct command of the Admiralty, it will further increase the Royal Navy's air combat strength. The Navy currently has 220 aircraft, which will increase to 685 by 1940, more than tripling. If necessary, the increase will exceed this number. The current five aircraft carriers, which can carry 170 aircraft, will be modernized, and five 22,000-ton aircraft carriers will be built, which can carry 350 aircraft, and can also be completed by 1940. Battleships and cruisers will also each be equipped with two to four aircraft, so that various warships can closely cooperate with the naval air combat strength in accordance with the latest offensive and defensive tactics. (Haitong dispatch of the 11th)

### British Newspaper Comments on Sino-Japanese Situation

[London] The "Liverpool Post," an important daily newspaper in northern England, is one of the closest observers of events in the Far East. Today, it commented that Chinese military leaders unanimously support Chiang Kai-shek's minimum peace terms, and that the second step in this situation should be taken by Japan. It is hoped that China's rejection of threats will awaken Japanese leaders. It is generally believed that Japan does not want a major war, even if victory comes at a great price and destroys its commerce. Tokyo may not have anticipated China's resistance. Judging from what it has already done, it will strengthen the Chinese military, who have now all raised their hands. The danger of war is drawing closer, and Japan may feel that it is time to take a more moderate approach. The newspaper concludes that direct negotiations between Tokyo and Nanjing based on Chiang Kai-shek's minimum conditions seem to be the only hope for averting war.

### Plans for Preventing and Rescuing from Air Raid Fires

— Special

Air defense plans are being prepared by all countries to take precautions. The Shanghai YMCA, seeing the tense situation in the country, has specially printed a booklet of air defense knowledge, priced at four cents per copy, and sold at the YMCA locations on Eight Immortals Bridge and Sichuan Road. It is truly a must-read for everyone. The Yulin Daily recently reprinted a news item from the London Daily Telegraph about plans to prevent and rescue from air raids. We will translate it here for reference. Even in peaceful times, Britain is actively preparing in this way. How much more so should our country today, with the danger of war breaking out at any moment. Every household should quickly send someone to assist the authorities in organizing air defense plans and practice every day while enemy aircraft have not yet arrived, to avoid being caught off guard. It must be known that today's war is not like the past. In the past, one could hide behind closed doors and hope to preserve one's life. Today, who knows which house a bomb will fall on. Therefore, for the sake of both public and private, one cannot shirk responsibility. Protecting one's area is protecting oneself and protecting one's family, just like being in the same boat. If the boat survives, everyone survives; if the boat sinks, everyone sinks. If everyone ignores each other, it is like waiting for death, equivalent to suicide. If we can care for each other, there is still hope of surviving death. This point requires the attention of all compatriots across the country.

According to the Daily Telegraph, the precautions taken by the British government to defend against aerial gas attacks, at least in the initial stages, are extremely expensive, but this problem is less difficult than the other problems that will be encountered. Building large-scale shelters to avoid damage from the most powerful bombs is difficult to implement, because such strong buildings require a lot of money to be effective. According to experts, such a structure must use cement and steel that have the equivalent effect of about fifty feet of soil to make large bombs ineffective, so that people hiding inside can be safe and sound. But this problem is currently being constantly studied, with special attention being paid to the protection of people trapped in the streets during air raids in bustling cities, and considering the best way to strengthen buildings that are currently under construction or are being prepared for construction. It also constantly pays attention to all developments in Europe regarding these issues.

Plans for defending against explosive bombs and bomb fragments can be effective with relatively less expense. Residents who want to know about these methods can inquire with the authorities.

The third type of aerial attack is incendiary bombs, which are perhaps the most difficult to defend against. These bombs are very light, each weighing only about two and a half pounds, so an aircraft can carry many of them. In addition, the chemical reaction after they explode can generate a lot of heat, and they cannot be extinguished with water. However, these bombs do not penetrate deep into houses, and often stop at the solid first floor after piercing the light roof. If the floor has sufficient strength, it can be foolproof (translator's note: this refers to concrete buildings). If yellow sand or soil is spread, the bomb will reduce its burning power when it lands on the sand or soil. Most importantly, the top floor should be cleaned up. All scattered debris and anything that could accelerate the spread of fire should be removed. Ordinary men and women, as long as they have defensive knowledge, can prevent the spread of fire. Furthermore, the fire departments in various places will now be expanded, and they will be constantly trained to prevent this danger and equipped with special equipment for this purpose.

In addition to dealing with the three major dangers of air raids, the "Air Defense Preparations Office" must also organize a team, which can be named "Humanitarian Affairs." They are responsible for ⑴ medical equipment, ⑵ rescuing victims from collapsed houses, and ⑶ treating the injured or those who have been gassed. Local officials should fully cooperate with the organization of this matter. Organizations such as the Red Cross should make all their equipment available to the government and should train members to be proficient in all defense plans. Towns with 100,000 or more people should train about 3% of their residents to take on the necessary tasks of air defense in order to cope. The above number includes the air defense supervisor, which is a very important organization. There are historical precedents for this. It recruits local responsible men or women to form a team. They should all receive air defense training to help local citizens when needed and to serve as liaison between various air defense groups and the general public. Although their training may last for several weeks, the total training time is no more than ten hours, which is not too much. The training includes ⑴ basic methods of protecting property, ⑵ simple first aid, ⑶ assembling gas masks, and an important task, which is to help co-manage the distribution of gas masks from storage and handle any necessary replenishment. In an emergency, the supervisor must fulfill the responsibility of a neighbor, helping others and dealing with things that happen at any time, especially summoning rescuers when needed. Upon completion of training, supervisors and other air defense volunteers will be issued silver badges or pins by the government.

Another plan is to establish a necessary organization to assist in promoting the treatment of specially injured people, which is the recently opened medical training class. Doctors, nurses, and medical students across the country are now rapidly receiving training in defensive gas plans with the help of specially trained medical instructors. The effect of this plan is gradually becoming apparent in London alone. Various places are now inviting medical instructors to give lectures, and they are overwhelmed with requests. They are scheduling lectures far into the future, and it is not known how many more there are. All those who invite them hope that they will come soon to satisfy the enthusiasm of the masses, like waiting for rain after a long drought. Therefore, they often encounter difficulties when scheduling dates with those who invite them.

The "Air Defense Preparations Office" must also deal with many other issues, such as enforcing the prohibition of lighting in towns at night and warning the public about the arrival of enemy aircraft. According to experience, the ban on lighting should be doubled in severity compared to the last war. These two things have been tested several times and will continue to be tested frequently. Other plans that are currently being discussed are methods to protect public utilities such as tap water, gas, and electricity, and to protect transportation facilities such as docks, ports, and railways. The needs of commerce and industry have also been given great attention by the authorities. Notices have been issued to major chambers of commerce across the country, as well as to builders, engineers, and other similar professionals. The capital and many large factories and shops in various places have been inspected by specially qualified personnel. Various information on this issue has been compiled into a special booklet entitled "Air Defense Preparations for Factories and Commercial Establishments," which related industrial and commercial businesses can request from the authorities.

### Japanese Consul-General Yesterday Visited Mayor Yu; Negotiations on the Hongqiao Incident Begin

Japanese Consul-General Raises Two Points, Immediately Refuted by Our Side; Sixteen Japanese Warships Arrived Suddenly Yesterday, We Raise Questions; Consular Corps Submits Memorandum to Both China and Japan

The unfortunate Hongqiao incident has now gradually entered the path of diplomatic negotiations. The Shanghai Consular Corps is also extremely concerned about the security of Shanghai and yesterday submitted a memorandum to both China and Japan. Sixteen warships of the Japanese Second Fleet have also arrived in Shanghai from Sasebo, and more than 2,000 naval landing troops have disembarked. Details as follows:

Hidak yesterday visited Chen Jie

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th - Japanese Embassy Counselor Hidak visited Deputy Foreign Minister Chen yesterday at 7:00 PM to discuss the Hongqiao case. It is reported that Hidak expressed to the Vice Minister the hope that the central government would instruct the local authorities to settle the case fairly on the spot as soon as possible.

Consular Corps Submits Memorandum

In view of the tense situation in North China and the serious situation in Shanghai, the Shanghai Consular Corps yesterday submitted the same memorandum to both China and Japan. At 3:00 PM, Norwegian Consul Ole (current leader of the Consular Corps) first visited Mayor Yu at the Municipal Government to deliver the memorandum, which stated in essence that the situation in North China is tense and the situation in Shanghai is also becoming serious. If an accident occurs, the lives, property, and businesses of foreign nationals in Shanghai will inevitably be affected. It is hoped that the Shanghai Municipal Government can pay attention to this and that all actions by any army that could disrupt peace and affect security should be completely avoided in the Shanghai area. Mayor Yu immediately replied that the Chinese government has always strived to maintain peace and has never taken any actions to disrupt security. The Municipal Government has always followed the instructions of the central government and has made unremitting efforts to maintain peace and security, and will continue to do so in the future. However, it is hoped that the Japanese side must also make similar efforts in order to achieve the goal of peace. It is hoped that the Consular Corps will pay attention to this. Consul Ole then left and visited Consul General Okamoto at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai to deliver the same memorandum.

Okamoto Visits Mayor Yu

Japanese Consul General Okamoto visited Mayor Yu at the Municipal Government at 4:15 PM to negotiate on the current situation in Shanghai in various ways. The talks lasted about three hours. Okamoto first stated that the incident in which Japanese naval officers and soldiers were killed at Hongqiao Airport had shocked the entire country of Japan. Regarding the resolution of this case through diplomatic channels, he had asked Tokyo for instructions. The Tokyo government agreed on the one hand and believed that it was necessary to question China's attitude towards the case. Secondly, in order to avoid similar incidents from happening before the case is resolved, there are two demands: ⑴ Withdraw the Peace Preservation Corps; ⑵ Completely remove the defensive works built by the Peace Preservation Corps. Mayor Yu replied that the Chinese government also attaches great importance to the occurrence of this unfortunate incident. As for China's attitude, it believes that both sides should thoroughly investigate the truth with a sincere and fair attitude, and then conduct negotiations through diplomatic channels, which can achieve a satisfactory resolution. It is hoped that the Japanese side will not be overly emotional or speculative, and will not infer facts based solely on ideals and assumptions. Furthermore, the facts of the case are currently being investigated by both sides, and the truth has not yet been determined. It is not permissible to speculate on who should bear the responsibility in the future. If China should be held responsible, China will never shirk responsibility. If the Japanese side should be held responsible, it is hoped that Japan should also bear it with the same open attitude. As for avoiding the occurrence of similar incidents, the Municipal Government has already paid attention to it. On the evening of the incident, it automatically retreated the sentries of the Peace Preservation Corps, which were closer to the Japanese residential area, to avoid conflict. As for the sandbags and barbed wire, they have also been removed to avoid alarming the citizens. What your side has requested, our side has already automatically done. Consul General Okamoto then inquired about the distance the Peace Preservation Corps had retreated and suggested that both sides send personnel to jointly determine it. Mayor Yu replied that the Peace Preservation Corps' departure from the Japanese residential area was an automatic act by our side to avoid conflict. There is no such thing as distance, and that area is our country's land, so there is no such thing as withdrawal. It is difficult to agree to sending personnel, as this is an unreasonable request. Okamoto also stated that the current location of the Peace Preservation Corps has formed a situation of surrounding the Japanese marines. Withdrawal is necessary to avoid conflict. Furthermore, works such as digging trenches and piling sandbags should also be removed. Mayor Yu replied that all measures taken by the Peace Preservation Corps were nothing more than for preventive purposes. In short, the Japanese side should be able to understand our side's determination to maintain peace. If they believe that the works of the Peace Preservation Corps are dangerous, then they are inevitably being overly sensitive. If the Japanese side can also abide by the boundaries, conflict can be avoided. Okamoto expressed satisfaction with this and said that he would report to the government immediately. Then they talked about the Hongqiao incident. Okamoto said that according to the Japanese investigation, Japanese naval officers and soldiers did not fire a shot. Mayor Yu said that Okamoto did not come today to negotiate on this case, so he was unwilling to discuss it in detail and would discuss it further when formal negotiations take place. Finally, Mayor Yu asked Okamoto if he knew that sixteen Japanese warships had come to Shanghai today, some anchored outside Wusongkou and some sailed into the Huangpu River, and that troops had landed. He also said that while diplomatic negotiations are underway on the one hand, increasing warships on the other hand is a threat, but our side has a fixed policy that cannot be changed by threats. Okamoto initially claimed not to know about the increase in warships, then said that if both sides can negotiate in good faith, it doesn't matter if more warships come. At around 7:00 PM, Okamoto left. Also yesterday, the Japanese side also sent Naval Attaché Okino to visit Commander Yang to make the same representations. Commander Yang was occupied, so he was received by Deputy Adjutant Zhao Weixian. It is also heard that the Japanese Embassy in Beijing has also sent Counselor Hidak to visit our foreign ministry to negotiate.

Autopsy of Deceased Soldier

The remains of Shi Jingzhe, the soldier of our side's airfield cover team who died in the incident, were examined and autopsied at the Zhenru Forensic Examination Office yesterday. Participants from our side were Municipal Government Secretary Zhang Tingrong, Police Bureau Inspectorate Chief Wang Dasui, and Garrison Command forensic pathologist Dai Shiyao. Japanese participants included Staff Officer Yamauchi and Army Medical Officer Arima. A Western Inspector Dong En from the Shanghai Municipal Council also participated. A detailed examination and autopsy of the gunshot wounds was conducted, and wound reports were filled out and kept on file.

News from Tokyo

A Tokyo dispatch states that the attitude of various newspapers towards the Hongqiao incident on the morning of the 11th was inconsistent. Some were slightly moderate, while others still considered it serious. The editorials of newspapers such as the Nichinichi Shimbun and Chugai Commercial News were very strong. Also, at noon on the 11th, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with foreign reporters and read out a prepared statement on the Hongqiao incident, which was generally the same as that published in the Nichibei Shimbun. After various questions, he replied that Japan hopes to resolve the Hongqiao incident peacefully.

### Chief of Staff of the Japanese Third Fleet Talks About Non-Expansion

Adding Troops to Protect Nationals; Asks Japanese Nationals to Trust

According to the Domei News Agency, Rear Admiral Rokuzo Sugiyama, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Third Fleet, issued the following statement at 5:00 PM today regarding the increase in troops of the fleet: "In light of the current situation, our Third Fleet has maintained a cautious and calm attitude in order to fully protect Japanese nationals. Today, for the sake of the current security, we have increased the necessary number of troops, but the security policy of the Third Fleet has not changed in any way because of this. We must still adhere to the spirit of non-expansion of the situation advocated by the Imperial Government. We hope that the Japanese nationals will trust our fully equipped Third Fleet, not be misled by rumors, and observe the situation calmly under this orderly control."

### Real Evidence Found of Selling Coal to the Enemy

How to Punish Zhang Zhangkui: Waiting for a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Handling

The Municipal Coal Industry Association previously received a secret report stating that a certain coal merchant was selling bituminous coal to the Japanese for use. After receiving the report, the association not only reported the situation to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, requesting their attention and assistance, but also appointed committee members Chen Erchang and Xu Chengfa to secretly investigate. It is now learned that the two committee members have reported their findings to the association. The details are recorded below:

Investigation Report

Regarding the presentation of the case, the 76th Extraordinary Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees on the 2nd of this month decided to appoint Erchang and Chengfa to investigate the 200 tons of Datong coal unloaded from the Zhonghua Pier by a certain foreigner on the 1st of this month, to determine who sold it and to report back. Erchang and others then went to various related parties to investigate and found that the coal was sold by the Jin Coal Sales Office to Zhang Zhangji on June 9th, with a total amount of 326 tons. The 200 tons unloaded by the foreigner were from within this amount, and 126 tons are still remaining. However, the Jin Coal Sales Office still had several piles of similar coal sold before July 5th that have not yet been cleared. A list is specially attached for your review. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Coal Industry Association, Chen Erchang and Xu Chengfa, respectfully.

Detailed Process

㊀ Qinyuan Foreign Firm, Hanye Pier, Chunli Wheel, 240 (piles), imported on May 17th. ㊁ Qinyuan Foreign Firm, Zhonghua Pier, Nanning Wheel, 216 tons, imported on May 23rd. ㊂ Zhang Zhangji, Zhonghua Pier, Nanning Wheel, 326 tons, imported on May 23rd. ㊃ Zhang Zhangji, Zhonghua Pier, Nanning Wheel, 364 tons, imported on May 23rd. ㊄ Xinyi Public, Zhonghua Pier, Shenhua Wheel, 253 tons, imported on June 26th. ㊅ Tong Fengtai, Hanye Pier, Chunli Wheel, 127.5 tons, imported on May 17th. ㊆ Yikang, Zhonghua Pier, Nanning Wheel, 333 tons, imported on May 23rd.

Attendees included Yang Runsheng, Chen Erchang, Chen Weibin, and over ten others. Chairman Bao Zhexing discussed the case of Zhang Zhangkui selling coal to the Japanese and how it should be handled. It was decided to publish the facts of the investigation in the market, and the punishment would be determined after the Municipal Chamber of Commerce responds.

### Utterly Unconscionable: Selling Rice to Support the Enemy

Traitorous Merchants Abound, Infuriating

Since the current situation began to affect the city, cases of traitorous merchants supporting the enemy have been discovered. Although various groups have strongly appealed and strived to prevent and expose such acts, some unscrupulous individuals have completely ignored these efforts, even intensifying their support for the enemy as before. They can truly be described as utterly heartless. It is reported that a certain rice shop on Haining Road specializes in doing business with the enemy. Since the July 7th Incident, it has transported over 3,000 dan of rice to the enemy, mostly transported in the deep of night or at 4:00 or 5:00 AM in the morning. The most frequent transport occurred between July 10th, 11th, and 12th. The day before yesterday (the 10th), at about 1:50 PM, another 20 dan were transported out. The license plate of the transporting truck was 16746, and the rice bags were printed with words such as "XX Corps Grain." At the same time, similar incidents were discovered on North Jiangxi Road. From this, it can be seen that the enemy is collecting supplies through every possible channel, and the utterly unconscionable merchants are as numerous as hairs, which is truly infuriating.

Furthermore, the Industrial Society stated that amidst the national unity, some shameless merchants took advantage of the recent typhoon in Shanghai to seek exorbitant profits by providing 4,000 dan of rice to the enemy. Upon hearing this news, people from all walks of life were extremely indignant. According to reporters, two rice shops, XX, etc., on Wuchang Road in Hongkou suddenly closed down yesterday without any reason, only posting a red paper with the words "Temporarily Closed." According to people in the industry, the business of these two shops was usually quite prosperous, and their sudden closure is rumored to be related to the case of supporting the enemy. Since this incident was revealed, it has attracted much attention from the public, and the closure of these shops is deeply meaningful.

### Philippine President Quezon Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday Morning

Chairman Wang's Representative and Others Went to Welcome Him; American Delegation and Philippine Investigation Team Accompany Him

Philippine President Quezon, who had traveled to the United States, returned to the Philippines on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover. He arrived here yesterday morning at approximately 7:30 AM and docked at the Qichang Pier in Pudong. Those who went to welcome him included Tang Liangli, representative of Chairman Wang of the Central Political Committee, Yu Hongjun, Mayor of Shanghai, Yu Ming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and several senior officials from the American Consulate General in Shanghai. Mr. Quezon shook hands with each of the welcomers on the ship to express his gratitude and said that he originally did not intend to go ashore during this stop in Shanghai, but because he had many friends in Shanghai, he decided to go ashore in a private capacity. However, he politely declined all receptions from the Chinese side. Mr. Quezon then took the Customs launch Jinghui alone at about 10:00 AM to cross the river and go ashore to visit friends. Mr. Arnold, the American Commercial Counselor, held a tea party yesterday evening at 7:00 PM to host Mr. Quezon and invited Mayor Yu and Mr. Yu Ming to accompany him. Mr. Quezon, along with six Philippine congressmen, including Mr. Benigno, who came to Shanghai to welcome him, will return to the Philippines on the original ship at about 11:00 PM tonight. Those who traveled with Mr. Quezon from the United States to the Philippines also included a delegation organized by various departments of the American diplomatic, military, political, and industrial sectors, including Mr. McCreary (former Minister to China) and Mr. Jack (former Consul General in Shanghai), and others. This group is going to investigate the current situation in the Philippines and is scheduled to return to the United States in mid-November.

Also, according to the Huadong News Agency, the Philippine Affairs Committee, organized by American people and Filipinos living in the United States, organized an investigation team to go to the Philippines to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the situation and business conditions. The team consisted of seven Americans and seven Filipinos. The chairman of the committee is Mr. Mark McCreary, the former (1922) American Minister to China. Mr. McCreary and his party arrived at the port this morning at 7:00 AM on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover. Mr. Gauss, the American Consul General in Shanghai, and American officials and gentry in Shanghai went to the pier to welcome them. After Mr. McCreary and his wife landed, they were accompanied by Mr. Gauss to the Consul General's residence on Anhe Temple Road to rest. At noon at 12:00 PM, Mr. Gauss hosted a banquet at the Citibank Club on Fuzhou Road. They were scheduled to tour the city in the afternoon and return to the Philippines on the original ship that night.

### The South Seas Progressive Society Plans to Organize Overseas Chinese Battlefield Service

Decides on Full Mobilization to Participate in Battlefield Service

The Shanghai Nanyang Progressive Society's purpose is to revitalize the nation and unite overseas Chinese from various regions to seek their own well-being as its main work. Since its establishment last year, many overseas Chinese from various regions have voluntarily joined the society. In particular, it has spared no effort in advocating for national salvation and has actively worked hard. It is reported that due to the Lugou Bridge Incident, the society immediately telegraphed its support for the soldiers at the front and convened a general meeting to launch the national salvation work. Because it was during the summer vacation, it was not easy to gather people. Now, feeling that the national situation is becoming increasingly critical and has reached the final stage of the entire nation's resistance, it is impossible to effectively resist the enemy without collective strength and unified action. Therefore, it is calling on all overseas Chinese compatriots to initiate the organization of an Overseas Chinese Battlefield Service Corps to discuss all aspects of the war of resistance and prepare to contact various overseas Chinese organizations to expand the organization of resistance against Japan and unify the national salvation route. The charter of the corps has been roughly drafted. The organizational outline is that the corps leader and deputy corps leader are responsible for leadership. In addition, there are six departments: General Affairs Department, Propaganda Department, Organization Department, Transportation Department, Protection Department, and Rescue Department, etc., to effectively participate in the war of resistance. It is heard that the members of the corps are purely overseas Chinese students who have returned to the country, and their patriotic enthusiasm is extremely high. They all have a determination to die and will strive for the glory and survival of the Chinese nation in the spirit of unyielding and adhering to the government's consistent policy and the leader's will, and fight to the end.

### The Atmosphere Suddenly Becomes Tense: Large Numbers of Japanese Warships Gather in Shanghai

Four Cruisers, Two Squadrons of Eight Destroyers; Two Torpedo Boats to Follow; British, American, and French Warships Coming and Going, Extremely Busy

The large number of Japanese warships transferred from Sasebo and Yokosuka to Shanghai arrived outside the Wusong Estuary yesterday. It is reported that there were two squadrons of destroyers, four cruisers, and two torpedo boats. From 1:25 PM to 1:50 PM, three cruisers, Yamashiro, Kinugasa, and Natori, entered the Huangpu River one after another via Wusong. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the cruiser Sendai also entered the port and was temporarily anchored at the Osaka and Huangpu wharves in Yangshupu. The ships were loaded with ammunition, and a large number of troops were being unloaded. Also, from 5:10 PM to 5:40 PM in the afternoon, four destroyers of the 9th Squadron and four destroyers of the 21st Squadron, as well as two torpedo boats, entered in a continuous stream and were all anchored in the waters of Yangshupu. The destroyers were also loaded with a large amount of military supplies and marine corps soldiers. They were all being unloaded and landed in Yangshupu that night. Two more squadrons of destroyers will follow to the outside of the Wusong Estuary and have not yet entered Shanghai.

The Japanese Special Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai originally had more than 6,000 people. Most of them were stationed at the headquarters at No. 10 Dongjiangwan Road, the Toyoda Inner and Outer Cotton Mills in West Shanghai, and the Gongda Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. However, the location of the buildings in these places is limited and can only accommodate the original Japanese troops. Therefore, the 2,000 Japanese troops who arrived in Shanghai from the Hankou area on the 9th had nowhere to settle down for a while. Therefore, in addition to closing the Japanese Elementary School at No. 192 Ouyang Road as a Japanese military station, the Japanese also closed the North Sichuan Road No. 596 Japanese North District Elementary School yesterday as a military camp, which is dedicated to the Japanese troops coming from Hankou. Therefore, the school has been fully occupied by Japanese troops since yesterday. At the same time, a large number of military supplies have also been transported in to prepare for a long-term stay. It is also learned that the Japanese will order all Japanese factories and schools to stop work completely and use the buildings as Japanese military stations when necessary.

In addition, one American warship and two French warships also sailed to Shanghai yesterday. The French ship "Basha" entered the port at 11:50 AM, the American transport ship "Lyman B." entered the port at 2:15 PM, and the French gunboat "Biquet" entered the port at 2:25 PM. In addition, the British destroyer "Defender" entered the port at 12:10 yesterday and was heading to North China.

### Shaw Steamtowel of the Shaw Industry Donates Five Thousand Yuan

Hong Zuyao Donates Five Thousand Yuan

Shanghai yarn magnate Shao Shengtuo, who founded the Chongxin Yarn Factory, has always had great enthusiasm for national affairs. Recently, in light of the deep and urgent nature of the crisis, he specially donated 50,000 yuan to the national salvation cause. The funds have been forwarded to Chairman Chiang by the Central Business Bureau (remittance receipt number 185). The telegram is recorded below: To Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission of the National Government of Nanjing, I respectfully read your instruction on national salvation, and the great plan for national salvation is inspiring the whole people. In the face of this deep and urgent crisis, all people should sacrifice everything to repay the country. Now, I, Shao Shengtuo, a Shanghai merchant, personally donate 50,000 yuan of national currency to the national salvation cause. I respectfully submit it to the Central Bank for remittance. A small contribution, but a sincere effort to fulfill my duty. I humbly request your acceptance. Shao Shengtuo, a Shanghai merchant, respectfully.

Also, Mr. Hong Zuyao of the yarn industry, deeply saddened by the seriousness of the national crisis, in the spirit of national self-sacrifice, specially donated 5,000 yuan of national currency. Yesterday, he specially sent it to the Xinwen Daily to forward it to the All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association for military needs. After receiving the donation, the association, in accordance with Article 5 of the fundraising measures, will send a letter of thanks and request the National Government to issue a commendation to encourage him.

### American Donates Valuable Warhorses to Support Our Resistance

A Total of Thirty-One Horses Worth Over Ten Thousand Gold Coins; The Support Association Often Requests Commendation

Yesterday, the All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association of this city received twelve warhorses donated by an American businessman from the Fuxiang Foreign Firm on Jiangxi Road.

### Over Two Hundred Returned Students and Overseas Chinese From Japan Returned to the Country Yesterday

Many Students Studying in the United States Also Returned on the Same Ship; They Shouted "Long Live the Republic of China" After Landing

Over two hundred students studying in Japan, overseas Chinese in Japan, and over one hundred students studying in the United States arrived in Shanghai on the President Hoover at 5:30 AM yesterday and crossed the Huangpu River at 8:30 AM, arriving at the New Customs Pier. The Shanghai Japanese Student Anti-Enemy National Salvation Association specially sent over thirty people, carrying national flags, to welcome them at the pier. Tan Zhonglu of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau also went to take care of them. After the returned students landed, they gathered on both sides of the baggage inspection area and sang the March of the Volunteers and shouted "Long Live the Republic of China" with the welcomers. They also immediately elected a representative, Mr. Xi, to report on the Japanese police's oppression of the returned students and overseas Chinese, saying that the students and overseas Chinese in Japan were not free, as if they were prisoners. Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the surveillance of students studying in Japan has been even stricter, and they are often arbitrarily arrested and imprisoned on false charges, with abuse of illegal punishment. There are still many students who are being detained by the Japanese police and have not been released. In addition, there are many students studying in Japan who want to return but cannot. We have returned to eliminate the enemy and request the government to find ways to protect the safety of the students and overseas Chinese in Japan who have not returned. Then, they elected Ye Wenjin and others as representatives to go to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting the government to resist the enemy and resettle students studying in Japan in Peiping and Tianjin. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency visited Sun Liyuan, a student returning from Japan, yesterday and learned that the returned students and overseas Chinese originally planned to hold a large-scale national salvation meeting on the President Hoover, but because there were still enemies on the same ship, the shipowner did not allow it for fear of causing disputes. Instead, they held the "President Hoover Returning Students From Japan Temporary Talk Meeting," which resolved: ㊀ To petition the government to immediately launch a nationwide war of resistance and resist to the end. ㊁ To request the government to provide opportunities for students to work for national salvation and resistance against the enemy. ㊂ To appoint Sun Liyuan as general affairs, Yin Shouzheng and Long E'xun as public relations, and Yao Nai as secretary. After arriving in Shanghai, they will join the Anti-Enemy National Salvation Association of Students Studying in Japan. Also, according to Mr. Sun, the current situation in Japan is that the conscription and fundraising for national salvation are extremely busy and cannot be overstated. The general public is also honoring the spirit of Bushido, so they are preparing very busily, blindly following the military's invasion of China in one go. It is heard that the cost of the North China Incident has increased to 700 million yuan, so the Japanese economy is gradually showing distress, and prices have soared to more than double. Even the most common bathing for the Japanese people has been increased in price despite public opposition. It will be impossible to balance the Japanese budget next year, so various political parties have criticized the military a lot. Mr. Sun finally told the reporter that the students and overseas Chinese in Japan have no security guarantees. This time, Yan Yansheng of Hosei University, Wang Yiqin of Meiji University, and Mr. Shi of Hōsei University were arrested before boarding the ship. This is what we know. There may be others who have been arrested. We hope that all circles will pay attention to and assist in this matter.

### French Authorities Spend Big to Construct Permanent Protective Barriers

Starting from Xiejia Bridge on Xujiahui Road, up to the riverbank of Rihui Port, the Engineering Department has already begun construction.

Since the Jiang-Zhe wars in the 13th year of the Republic of China, and the recovery of Shanghai by the National Revolutionary Army in the 16th year, the French Concession authorities, recognizing the importance of defense along the border between the Chinese and French areas, and for the sake of protecting the residents, businesses, and overseas Chinese within the concession, have specially spent a large sum of money to build cement and steel-reinforced iron gate barriers at the intersections of the Republic of China Road from Xiaodongmen to Fangban Bridge, as well as from the end of Nanyang Bridge Mintini Road, and Lanweiai Road southward to Xiejia Bridge, for closure in case of emergency, in order to maintain security within the concession. From Xiejia Bridge westward along Xujiahui Road to Xujiahui in western Shanghai, there used to be a riverbank as a natural barrier, and iron wire fences were only installed on the riverbank in case of emergency for protection. However, in the past four or five years, the Chinese authorities have built a road by filling in the Xuejia River in the Nanshi area, from the Bund westward to Rihui Port. Since then, residents on both sides of the Chinese and French border in this section can freely travel north and south. Now it is heard that the French Concession authorities, in view of the recent tense situation, and to protect the safety of residents and shops along the southern border of the concession, will have the Public Works Department spend a large sum of money to build a wall along Xujiahui Road, from Xiejia Bridge westward to the Rihui Port riverbank, and open iron gate barriers at key intersections, as a permanent protective barrier. The Public Works Department has already hired workers to first plant wooden stakes and erect two or three rows of barbed wire on them, and is also purchasing bricks and hiring masons to start laying the foundation of the wall from Xiejia Bridge.

### Spanish Nationals Subject to Our Jurisdiction

The right of consular jurisdiction is revoked; one offender is detained.

Since the outbreak of the civil war in Spain, its envoys and consuls stationed in China have been recalled to their country, and the protection of Spanish nationals in China has become a problem. Therefore, our government has issued an order that all matters concerning the protection and judicial issues of these nationals should be managed by our country. At 5:30 PM yesterday, Spanish national Emilio Kloss, along with Chinese nationals Lu Jinzhang and Zhou Zhiqin, were found lying on the ground smoking drugs in the Jiugeng Lane on Miller Road, Hongkou, and were immediately arrested by the police officers of the Hongkou Police Station. At that time, Emilio falsely claimed to be a Filipino. After investigation with the US Consulate, it was learned that Emilio was not Filipino. Emilio then admitted to being Spanish. Therefore, this morning, the police station transferred the three individuals to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Zhong Qing interrogated them. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted them under Article 8 of the anti-drug regulations. The confessions of the three offenders were extremely vague. The court ruled to postpone the hearing for further investigation. This is the first case of Spanish nationals being tried by our country's criminal court.

### Elementary School Teacher Seduces and Rapes Domestic Helper

First advertises for a position and then takes the opportunity to commit violence; later makes excuses for dismissal, leading to the lawsuit.

Xie Xiangsheng, a native of Wujin, 36 years old, is currently a class teacher at the Ragna Elementary School established by the French Concession Public Works Department. He previously resided with his wife at 14 Jiyi Lane, Bubbling Well Road. Last year, his wife saw that Xie was greedy for pleasure and the feelings between them deteriorated, eventually leading to divorce. On April 7th of this year, Xie suddenly placed an advertisement to hire a female domestic helper. Wang Jie, a 20-year-old woman from Pinghu, residing at 9 Yongyu Lane, Lafayette Road, brought her graduation certificates from Mingde Elementary School and Chenxi Middle School and applied for the position. She was selected and it was agreed that Xie would pay her a monthly salary of 15 yuan. On April 26th, she began serving, assisting Xie with his daily household chores and grading elementary school papers. Soon they became acquainted. Xie even showed Wang the divorce certificate with his ex-wife and took the opportunity to express his desire for marriage. Wang, feeling that the matter was too sudden, dismissed it and left. Unexpectedly, at 4 PM on May 16th, while Wang was writing in Xie's house, Xie used a blanket to cover her face and mouth and forcibly raped her. Wang was helpless under the violence. She was then raped four more times, and he promised to marry her. However, soon after, Wang developed a disease in her lower body and was sent to the Chunzai Hospital on Ningbo Road for treatment.

At 10 AM yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian summoned the defendant Wu Zhihao to the Second Criminal Court. Wu was not summoned because he was not at the Daxinshenzhuang in Taozhuli on Ermalu. Instead, a lawyer appeared on his behalf, saying that Wu was not in Shanghai and had only made a telephone call to entrust the lawyer, but the power of attorney was not signed, so the entrustment was not valid. The plaintiff Shen Yindai claimed that she had a husband surnamed Yao, but was seduced by the defendant in every way and divorced her husband nine years ago, then lived with Wu and had a son named Wu Xianhua, now nine years old. Previously, he paid 100 yuan per month for living expenses, but later reduced it to 30 yuan. Unexpectedly, since the 24th year, the defendant's feelings changed.

Spot Yarn Sales Only 794 Bales, Futures Only 2,350 Bales

The yarn market's quiet state saw continuous, enthusiastic buying from customers for several days. The purchased quantity was quite large, and it seemed that their appetite was sated. A temporary stagnation might be possible. Therefore, yesterday's transaction was within 1,000 bales. As for the tagged yarn situation, due to the daily reduction in warehouse inventory, the sellers had no way to replenish it. There was slight patching up, and the market price rebounded upward, making the market situation feel more consolidated. However, the price fluctuation of Japanese Grade 3 yarn was significant, with ups and downs ranging between 5 and 10 yuan, indicating the market chaos there.

Tagged Yarn Rebounds Due to Covering Shorts

In the second round of trading, it was difficult to see price increases in various months, but the magnitude of the increases was very slight. The market transaction was quiet. In the third round, except for September, the prices for all other months were blank, truly because of the increasing foreign aggression and the difficulty for speculative merchants to develop due to tight financing. Therefore, the market injury became increasingly sluggish, with a transaction of only 2,350 bales.

New Cotton Price Falls Below 40 Yuan Mark

In the early trading of cotton, the market showed signs of great weakness, because American cotton was weak, and Indian cotton's price drop was surprisingly strong, around 10 rupees. People's confidence remained low, and new buyers had little enthusiasm. Therefore, the market situation became softer, and except for January, prices for all months fell below the 40 yuan mark.

Spot cotton fell by 24 points, and futures fell by 2 to 3 points.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market became weaker, because the national crisis was serious, and the credit was tight. All routes had little demand, and the selling prices continued to fall. White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao per piece. Colored cloth, printed flannel, line tweed, serge, and bleached cloth all tended to fall in price, and generally fell by about 1 jiao. The number of transactions was small. Some of the dyeing factories in the Huajie Hongkou district of this port are no longer working as usual. The factories that have started work also hold the idea of not storing up gray fabrics. Therefore, the movement of gray fabrics is becoming increasingly clear. Due to tight credit, Nanchang, Hankou, and Fuzhou are slowly loading goods. Financial markets in Wan and Xiang are slightly looser, and they continue to load more than 100 pieces. The Shu Gang still has orders to rush to load. The white goods from the Wuzhou Gang have better demand for new transactions. Yesterday, 150 to 160 pieces of coarse cloth such as the 16-pound Baoxing and 13-pound Jiutian brands were delivered, and more than 200 pieces of lower-grade Changzhou fine twill were delivered.

### Commercial News Briefs

▲ Flour and Wheat Can Be Cleared Within the Week The flour and wheat markets have been settling prices these days, and it is said that they can be settled by the end of this week. As for the issue of opening the market, the situation is still serious. Even if there is an opportunity to open the auction this month, the business of each route is invisibly suspended, and the eleven measures promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are too restrictive, and the future will be more obstructed. Therefore, there will be no opening auction recently. Because the factory has no demand and no delivery, the flour has been stopped for a long time in the north, and only the Nanyang area has a slight route. The market is similar to the beginning of the week, and there is no change.

▲ The Price of Thin Rice in the North Market Is the Only One That Is Standing Firm (South Shanghai) The source is more than 30 shops, with a total of 5,700 to 5,800 shi of goods. The market in this street cannot be transported to the concession, and only a very small number of Nanshi Xingxiang Zhuang shops have demand, resulting in a quiet market. A total of 700 to 800 shi of new glutinous rice were delivered to the unified market, and the price was the same as the original. (North Shanghai) The source is 17 or 18 shops. The opening price of Nongjian Bai Gengdian's sales is slightly moving, and the market is strong. The high-quality goods are closely priced by several points, and the thin rice is actively sold, and the high-quality goods are improved. The medium-quality goods are standing firm. The price of the customer's rice is half correct, and the price of Dujian is closely priced. The price of Baiyuan goods is scarce and actively sold, and the price is closely priced near the corner. Dongxin's glutinous rice has arrived and sales are smooth, and the price is stable.

▲ Each Party's Route for Customer's Rice Is Not Weak Yesterday, the arrival of Customer's Rice turned strong, and the inland of Mianminchi turned sluggish, and the market once turned soft by several points to near corners. Because of the issue of rice shipments from Hexia, this street went to the rice to customers' rice. The sales to the Yonggang have not declined so far, and there are also some embellishments in the inland. Currently, the transportation and sales bureau and the Agricultural Bank of China are still actively delivering to the unified market. The machine and Jijing Rice have all picked up the high price and continued to handle it. Therefore, the market has returned to a flat and firm level. The city has opened 7,725 bags of Gan Rice, 4,535 bags of Xiang Rice, and 2,332 bags of Shashi Rice.

▲ Factory Silk Falls Below 700 Yuan Yesterday, the closing price saw a new low. General foreign firms and powerful silk factories took the opportunity to absorb it. For example, the white factory's B-character silk cocooning silk fell below the 700 yuan mark, which is an unprecedented record this year. Other prices, such as 81 points for 725 yuan, 78 points for 720 yuan, and ordinary Yangfan silk for 715 yuan, are all new low prices. Yesterday, foreign firms delivered 70 dans, and users delivered 50 dans, which is more active than the previous market. In the foreign silk market, Lyon Huasi has not moved, and Japanese silk has fallen by 1 franc. New York's near- and far-term prices have risen by 1 cent to half a cent, while Yokohama has risen slightly. It is said that although there have been labor strikes in New York and other places, manufacturers are still interested in futures silk, so the price of silk has not fallen sharply.

▲ The Price of Transshipment Dutch White Sugar Rises by Another 1 Jiao Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market turned strong. The guild's marking board called the spot price for 24 coarse sand white sugar the original price, and the price of transshipment goods rose by another 1 jiao, with more than 1,000 bags being traded at 9.1 yuan. Benmian Zhendi Jinxin and Dahua have not changed. Some Shuntou Gang opened more than 100 bags of Zhengmian Chi at 17.6 yuan. Guang Gang opened several hundred bags of Qizi Huizhou white sugar at 20.05 yuan and a half. Xingji Gang opened several hundred bags of Dagong white sugar at 20.03 to 0.02 yuan. The cooperative company sold 670 bags of Shi Xin Wuyang coarse white sugar at 24.1 yuan, and Shunde sold another 100 bags at 24.15 yuan, and collected 870 bags of transshipment Dutch coarse white sugar at 9.2 yuan. It is said that the next period of Yue coarse white sugar will increase by 5 fen, and the transshipment coarse sand white sugar will increase by 1 jiao.

▲ Golden Needles and Black Melon Seeds All Show Upward Trend (Golden Needles) Recently, the source has been blocked, and the vehicle transport is very slow, so the Shen City's inventory has gradually felt the shortage, and the trend has turned tight. In addition, the Shantou, Guangdong, Fujian, Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Wenzhou Taiwan gangs have all purchased, and the market has become more prosperous. Yesterday's quotations, such as Shangzhong Zhuangcai, opened at more than 23.3 yuan, up nearly yuan. At the same time, the market also rose accordingly, such as Ding Zhuangcai sold for 26 yuan, Daxingcai for 24 yuan, Suqiancai for 23 yuan, and Xuzhoucai for 25.5 yuan. (Black melon seeds) Since the new product was released, the trend has been upward due to the lack of both arrival and inventory. Currently, Xukui seeds are sold for 25.5 to 26 yuan, and Taixing seeds are sold for 23.5 to 24 yuan.

▲ The Selling Price of Tianjin Red Dates Is Chaotic Recently, Tianjin red dates have disappeared, and there is not much inventory in this city. Watching the continuous customer sales is quite good, and the number of each company is becoming more scarce. It is said that although there are several Zhuang left in the warehouse, they are holding back and refuse to open them. The secret plate of dates has been sold for 22 yuan for the head household, 15 yuan for the second household, and 12.5 yuan for the second household. At present, the selling price of the market is chaotic, and the market is still looking firm.

▲ Qiflu Red Tea Sales to the UK Turn Smooth Yesterday, the tea market continued to trade smoothly. The British Zhuang Yihé and Baochang firms purchased a lot of Qimen and Fuliang red tea, and the city's turnover was more than 1,000 boxes, and the price remained unchanged. Tunxi Chouxin Zhenmei green tea, Yongxing Meixing Yulong and other firms, have all handled the high Zhuang goods of each family. The top plate opened at 115 yuan, and items such as Zhenmei and Xiumei continued to be lively. Xiehe Fushi and other firms are still searching for it, but the market disk is slightly smaller.

Publishing World

### After Reading "New Huzhou Inaugural Issue"

— □

The inaugural issue of New Huzhou, published by the Shanghai Hu Society, is a satisfying local publication. From the inaugural statement, we can see that its purpose is to "build a new China by supporting the leader and the government to implement the Three Principles of the People" and "promote local autonomy." Such a publishing purpose is well-suited to the mission of a local publication.

The content of this issue is quite substantial. In addition to the inaugural statement, it contains fifteen articles, with two attached letters regarding the "Xi'an Incident." In terms of editing, there are no problems of uneven material or disorganized arrangement. Now, let's select a few of the more important articles as representatives to discuss it in general.

In the "Youth Lecture" section, Chen Guofu's article on the meaning of life is a very valuable youth motto. First, he explains the position of man in the universe and demonstrates it with the history of human evolution. Secondly, he points out the principle of being a person: "That is, to obey group discipline and serve the public;" and cites Dr. Sun Yat-sen's saying "Life is for service" and President Chiang Kai-shek's "Life is for enhancing the life of all mankind." Next, he clearly indicates the responsibilities that people should fulfill to the nation and the people: (1) We must create industries for the nation; (2) Scholars should serve the public even more; (3) We must have the ambition and confidence to revive the country; (4) Recognize the value of people. Such an article can serve as a good lesson for the youth of our country.

Zhu Jiahao's congratulatory speech for New Huzhou is also well-written. Most congratulatory articles focus on empty boasting, with no practical theory. However, Mr. Zhu's congratulatory speech is very special, with not a single word of praise for New Huzhou. Furthermore, he contributes several opinions on the reform and construction of Huzhou, such as improving silk, revitalizing industry, and promoting public sports. These all provide good guidance for the local innovation cause.

Furthermore, Pan Gongzhan's letter in reply to Japanese Yamasaki Yasuzumi, although set as a personal letter, contains the great value of explaining national foreign policy. Mr. Pan, in accordance with the sequence of Mr. Yamasaki's letter, gave very accurate answers regarding the "Xi'an Incident," China's good neighborly policy, and the efforts of our government for unification. This reply can not only answer Mr. Yamasaki's personal questions, but also eliminate all misunderstandings of China by the Japanese.

Also, Ah Zhenhua's article, A Record of the Inundation of the Lu Family's Book Collection into Japan, is truly a rare historical account. The outflow of antiques, calligraphy, and paintings from our country to foreign countries has been common throughout the dynasties, which is a great loss to our culture! This article, using this issue as its subject matter, can be said to have fulfilled its responsibility to alert the people of the country to preserve cultural heritage.

In short, the publication of the inaugural issue of New Huzhou is a joyous event. Because it is the pioneer of local publications in our country, it has made great contributions to "promoting local autonomy." We hope that every city, county, and district in our country should publish one in order to promote local autonomy and innovation and construction undertakings.

### Recitation Method

— Written by Cao Kuibai and Huang Zhongsu, Published by Kaiming

Speaking of "Recitation Method," it seems like an outdated reading method, not worth further study. In fact, "recitation method" still has research value: First, where did the "recitation method" fail in the past? Is it because of not paying attention to syllables, posture, form, explanation, but just blindly reading and dead reading? Second, there should be new ways to develop recitation method: to explore the true advantages of recitation method from a new perspective. With these two meanings in mind, those with ambition to study will get the result that is this book "Recitation Method."

The reading method of recitation is abandoned by educators, Chinese teachers, and young readers, all because of the common malady of "reading books to death, reading books in a dead way, reading books to die" in the past, not because of the disadvantages of recitation itself. Moreover, Chinese literary books are very complicated, some are suitable for reading, some are suitable for browsing, and some are suitable for careful reading. Only reading and browsing, thinking that you have exhausted the abilities of reading, without careful reading, then, the effect received, to be honest, is doing half the work and getting twice the result. Therefore, Xia Mianzun of the Ministry of Education of secondary schools, focusing on broadcasting speeches and learning Chinese, said in the last two paragraphs:

I advise you to use some effort in reading. In the past, the only way for scholars to learn writing was to read. Since the advent of school education, people often only use their eyes to look at the text, and there are not many people who use their mouths to read. In fact, reading is a very effective method. Most of the matters mentioned just now, such as words, sentences, and expression methods, can be discovered and understood during reading.

From this paragraph, you can understand the importance of recitation method. Knowing the importance of recitation method, but not understanding the method of recitation, you will inevitably "sigh at the ocean" or fall back into the old methods of recitation. This book "Recitation Method" may have been produced in response to this urgent need to solve difficult problems" to avoid the difficulties and pain of those who study or recite without a method.

In my opinion, the characteristics of this book "Recitation Method" can be divided into three points:

The first point is to open up new ways for recitation method: to examine and study the four parts of the human physiological vocal organs, respiratory organs, larynx, and nasal cavity, and their effects on speech sounds, so that people who learn recitation method can understand the key to pronunciation, writing, and language at a glance. This can be said to be something that past recitation did not have, and is only seen by those who are now studying recitation.

The second point is to correct the disadvantages of past recitation methods: such as the past recitation was "shaking the head and wagging the tail", "bending the back", which is enough to cause the reader's fatigue, unable to read to the end of an article, all are explained in detail, and corrected with "straighten the waist and sit upright". It can be said to do everything possible to correct it.

The third point is to carefully review the various knowledge related to and helpful to recitation method. Such as grammar, punctuation, phonetics, style, and the influence of pronunciation on region and time. It is said very broadly and very succinctly, which can help researchers of recitation a lot.

These three points can be said to open up a new face for recitation method and advocate a new record for recitation method.

The author, Mr. Huang, has indeed used a lot of thinking, research, and collection, and many years of experience to write it: it should not be ashamed of Qian Jibo's compliment in the preface called "the unique knowledge of the contemporary era."

The method of recitation is not only a good reading method in terms of reading books! It is also a good helper in writing. If you have three creations, whether they are in colloquial or classical Chinese, if you can recite them once when they are finished, you will at least find many errors and unsatisfactory places. Correct these errors and unsatisfactory places one by one, and stop only when there are no more errors when you recite them again, then this manuscript will not be unreadable, or be rejected when submitted.

Readers who are interested in studying recitation method, but are suffering from not having good reading materials for recitation method research, the content of this book "Recitation Method", I think readers have understood enough after reading the above three points, so I will not have any more explanations and introductions. (The End)

### Resisting the Enemy

When sleeping, to prevent the cool breeze from directly penetrating the chest and abdomen, and mosquitoes from disturbing sweet dreams, how can there not be a curtain on the bed?

To avoid the fragile imported curtain materials and protect our interests, we should all rise up and adopt cool silk curtains.

Triangle brand cool silk curtains, produced by the Sanyou Industrial Society on Nanjing Road, are very durable and especially long-lasting.

### Impressions of "The Wilderness"

— Zhier

When reading the script of "The Wilderness," I was tempted by Mr. Cao Yu's exquisite dialogue. Under his pen, the characters he created are so flesh and blood that he makes you see living people. However, I strongly disagree with the ghostly monsters produced by Chou Hu's hallucinations in the third act of the play being brought to the stage, although the author once stated: "In order to show that this is Chou Hu's hallucination, I used a second person. Hua is by his side. Except for his fear in the forest, she is not at all aware of the existence of those hallucinations." However, once the hallucinations are brought to the stage, these hallucinations do not belong to Chou Hu alone, but to the entire audience. Although the author used a second person by his side to show it, the result is still the same. Backward audiences will still use "believe it or not" as the reason for the existence of ghosts. And in the second act, the crying of the little black child, and in the first act, Jiao's dream talk, do they not also give the audience the premonition of "a fierce tiger is coming to the door, and there is an evil god in the house"? Perhaps the playwright intended to increase the atmosphere with these things, but in terms of objective effect, it would have a bad effect. In other words, if backward audiences watch "The Wilderness," they will be even more likely to believe in the existence of ghosts and monsters.

Regarding the theme of the play, we can understand that the author wants to explain that the revenge of individual heroism is bound to fail. Although the revenge is avenged, he himself cannot escape, and cannot escape to the place paved with gold to live a new life. However, excuse my boldness, such a theme is not obvious in "The Wilderness." Although there are a few sentences like "Tell them that Chou Hu doesn't believe in heaven or earth now, he only believes that if the brothers fight with them together, they will be able to live, and one person will die. Tell them not to be afraid of power and not to be afraid of difficulties, tell them that we have to fight out now, and one day our children and grandchildren will rise up," but what the concrete plot tells us is that Chou Hu has avenged two generations of grievances, and the object of revenge is the son of the enemy, his good friend, his sworn brother. In our country, which is too ignorant of revenge, although revenge should be promoted, it seems that there is still room for discussion about the object of revenge being a "good brother" who has a lot of friendship? We should oppose the warlords colluding with local bullies to oppress the people, but what should be overthrown is this existing society and the people who dominate such a society. What is the fault of his children and grandchildren? What is the fault of his children and grandchildren who do not do evil?

Based on this point, after watching this revenge, I immediately thought of "Admonishing the World" and "Don't use up all your heroism, leave three points for your children and grandchildren," but is the theme of "The Wilderness" here? Of course not. If it were, it would be encouraging gangsters to play water and land Taoist temples.

Yes, the characters here must have primitiveness, and primitive characters are also very cute. For example, Chou Hu, he is a man. Eight years of hatred are buried in his heart. He doesn't even hum when his leg is broken. When he has the opportunity, he finally avenges himself. When he is surrounded and has nowhere to escape, he is unwilling to die in the hands of the enemy, and would rather stab himself to death. How much pain should such a man cause people, and how much should he be worth touting, especially in this time of "slapping and smiling face," how should those things without spine be ashamed to death! But since the author understands this point, since he understands the inevitable failure of individual heroism, then why not use this effort to write something more positive? To put it even more bluntly, the author's effort in writing "The Wilderness" was wasted. Even if there is a good plan, the effect received is the opposite.

I heard that the author's fourth script is planned to write about the student movement in the north, which makes people very happy. With the author's cultivation and past achievements, I believe that this time he will definitely give us a satisfactory work. Here, I would like to sincerely offer the author a memorandum: When creating scripts, please pay more attention to the conditions of performances on the Chinese stage, it is best not to have too many characters, and it is hoped that the scenes can be saved. It is better not to use those scene changes. You must know that the performance of a script is not as effective as allowing all small troupes to perform it, rather than letting a well-equipped troupe have a commendable achievement. And in today's China, small troupes are many times more than the so-called big troupes.

The performance of "The Wilderness" by "Yeshi", if only in terms of art, can naturally be said to be successful. The acting skills of the actors alone gave people a thumbs up and said "satisfied"! The stage setting is more advanced than before, and the scene changes are also quite fast. As for the deletions in the script, they can also be said to be just right. However, if you want to talk about social significance, I'm sorry, that is really too far from technology.

We naturally also understand the difficulties of professional troupes, but in this critical moment, when the survival of the nation is under the greatest threat, when you have to stand up and fight if you don't want to perish, it is always not right to take too much care of the profession and compromise the mission of the drama. And in this critical period, we feel that watching the performance of "The Wilderness" is too slow to help.

We also know that the friends of "Yeshi" have taken on the performance of the second group of "Defending Lugou Bridge." We hope to perform it quickly, and at the same time, we hope that future performances will be as suitable as possible to the pulse of the times.

The times are racing forward, and if we are not careful, we will fall behind.

### Each Subject Training of Elementary Schools in Extraordinary Times

— Jin Juansheng

Our country is now in an extraordinary period, and the training of each subject in elementary schools is extremely important. I hope that all elementary schools in this city will always inspire children's patriotic enthusiasm. The following is a list of the teachings of each subject for my colleagues in elementary education to refer to. If there are any mistakes or incompleteness, please point them out.

Civics: Tell stories of national heroes in our country, and teaching materials on virtues such as mutual assistance and chivalry.

Chinese Language: Collect patriotic scripts for singing and performing, and teaching materials for lectures and writing on national defense and self-defense (this subject can be linked to music).

Social Studies: To enable children to understand the general situation of national fortresses, seaports, and transportation, and teaching materials on the military strength, public morale, and policies of various countries.

Natural Science: Recognition of the types and functions of military weapons, what materials are used and how they are manufactured, and teaching materials on common sense of air defense, anti-virus, and first aid (this subject can be linked to labor).

Arithmetic: Teaching materials on the military preparations and import and export goods of various countries in the world.

Physical Education: Impart military common sense and how to maintain order in the event of war.

The above teaching materials for each subject are similar, and can be systematically connected to form a whole, and the spirit of education in extraordinary times can be instilled into children's minds from an early age, so that their national consciousness can be rooted.

### Defending Lugou Bridge (4)

— Written by Chen He

At this time, Zhang Xiaoliu, the young son of the boss Zhang, ran into the teahouse, his head covered in sweat, and reported:

"The Japanese soldiers are coming! There are those on horseback, those pulling cannons, and iron cars and Wangbache cars. (Tanks) Now they are grabbing people everywhere, asking them to dig ditches, feed horses, and carry things. Those who refuse are whipped with horse whips. An old man was whipped dozens of times, his whole body was covered in blood, his head was broken, and now he is only left with a gasp for air!"

"The crops are all ruined. A lot of soybeans have been fed to the horses. When the Wangbache cars drove over, they pressed the ground into some big pits, as if it had been turned over!"

Ding Datou has two mu of soybeans, which he was going to use to marry a wife after the autumn harvest. Isn't it over now? He rushed up to see it regardless of everything...
