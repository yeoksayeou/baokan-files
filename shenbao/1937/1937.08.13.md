### Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Talks About Resisting Violence and Exercising Self-Defense

Japanese Rhetoric Contradicts Actions in Fact; All Future Responsibility Should Be Borne by the Japanese Side

[Nanjing] A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry stated that since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese side has repeatedly claimed verbally that it does not want to escalate the situation, but its actions in fact contradict this. Taking North China as an example, the Japanese side initially claimed to resolve the issue peacefully on the spot, then sent large reinforcements to attack Beiping and Tianjin, committing massacres and arson without restraint. Now, it has further advanced, on one hand, fiercely attacking Nankou, and on the other hand, coveting the southern part of Hebei Province, without end. In Shanghai, the Japanese side verbally agreed to our proposal to resolve the Hongqiao Airport incident peacefully through diplomatic channels, but the Japanese government dispatched a large number of aircraft, warships, marines, and other armed forces to Shanghai, threatening us at will, and at the same time, made various demands, attempting to remove or weaken our self-defense forces. Japanese aircraft have also been illegally flying over Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places for days, preparing for military action. All these actions are violations of our country's territorial sovereignty and violations of various international treaties. In this situation, our country cannot tolerate it. In addition to resisting violence and exercising self-defense, there is no other way. All responsibility for the future development of the situation should be borne entirely by the Japanese side.

### Chen Lifu Gives a Broadcast Speech

Titled "War and Peace"

[Nanjing] Chen Lifu, a member of the Central Standing Committee, gave a broadcast speech on the Central Radio Station at 8 p.m. on the 11th entitled "War and Peace." A summary of its essentials is recorded below. Peace has reached a critical juncture, and war is becoming an unavoidable fact. The fate of East Asia is unpredictable, and world peace cannot be guaranteed. At this critical moment of survival, we deeply feel that the hope of reversing the situation is almost gone, but we still want to discuss the true meaning of the word "peace" on the eve of the war, because we want the people of the country to understand that the purpose of war is still for peace, and the path to achieve peace is unavoidable with war. Once the understanding is clear, the desire for peace and the determination to fight can reinforce each other, the psychological contradictions can be resolved, the contribution of capabilities can be strengthened, and there will be ample time to respond to changes. Now, let's try to speak of the true meaning of the word "peace" in Eastern culture, and say that those who are similar supplement each other with abundance to make up for deficiencies, so that there is no difference between each other in the horizontal aspect (no infighting). The so-called "peace" is to supplement each other with abundance to make up for deficiencies, so that there is no difference in height in the vertical aspect (no class). When vertical and horizontal differences are reduced, the two become more similar, grow together without harming each other, and move forward together towards the progress of evolution without stopping. This is the true meaning of peace. Therefore, in terms of the universe, peace is actually the accumulation and arrangement of matter and force, harmony in motion, and equilibrium in stillness, so that each unit's movement and stillness conform to nature, and each obtains its proper place. Therefore, it is said that "the attainment of harmony brings forth the nourishment of heaven and earth." For example, when high-voltage electricity is connected to low-voltage electricity, the high and low harmonize, the flow stops on a plane. When two liquids with different temperatures are mixed, the higher temperature gradually decreases and the lower temperature gradually increases until the two are mixed to the same temperature. As for the kinetic energy of other universes, they all harmonize and equalize each other, and even matter is constantly combined and enters the final state of harmony and stability. Therefore, peace is the law of nature. In terms of humanity, peace is full of the spirit of service and mutual assistance, so that the strong support the weak, the wise benefit the foolish, the many help the few, and self-improvement continues without interruption, all moving forward together on the path of progress, to reach a state where people are basically the same in vertical and horizontal aspects, which is what we call the world of great harmony. Therefore, only when countries can base themselves on the active spirit of "harmony" and "peace" can they advance the world towards great harmony, and only when Chinese people can base themselves on the active spirit of "harmony" and "peace" and "struggle" can they "save China" from peril. Therefore, it is said that "the unity of harmony nourishes all things," and "peace is the way of heaven, and those who harmonize with it are the way of man. The unity of the way of heaven and the way of man is the way of the king. The explanation says "The interconnection of Heaven, Earth, and Man is called Kingship." Peace is full of positive spirit, and it should be so in ordinary times, and even more so in extraordinary times. Since the Wanbaoshan Incident until now, the Japanese people's brutal behavior in our country has only increased the disharmony in the spirits of the two countries and made the inequality in facts more evident. When there is disharmony, there is resistance; when there is inequality, there is outcry; this is the law of nature. Today, if one does not address the issues of harmony and equality and wants to forcibly stop people's resistance and outcry, it is to abandon the root and pursue the branches. If one wants to talk about improving Sino-Japanese relations in this way, it is no different from climbing a tree to catch a fish. The true meaning of peace has been lost, the ties of coexistence have been lost, the signs of disharmony and inequality are increasing day by day, and the idea of selfishness and self-interest cannot be contained, leading to actions that benefit oneself at the expense of others, and contempt for justice, only strength is valued. As a result, how can one not lack propriety, righteousness, and be shameless? Within the country, the discipline is utterly destroyed, and in the international arena, trust and integrity are completely lost. Patriotic people dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and young soldiers act recklessly without restraint. When the four cardinal principles are not upheld, the foundation of the country is lost. The inherent spiritual civilization of the East, with its loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, honesty, righteousness, peace, and the true meaning of the way of the king, vanishes without a trace, willingly becoming "hounds of the hegemonic way, and not city walls of the kingly way." Still, it is pretentious to talk about inheriting Eastern culture and practicing the way of the king. I will weep for Eastern culture and the way of the king. It is no wonder that Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Prime Minister, often sighed deeply when he mentioned the Asian issue to Japan. Considering that under this kind of situation, those with the power to make harmony and peace a reality are precisely those who fear day and night that the emotion of disharmony will decrease and that the degree of inequality will not increase, and that aggression and oppression are increasing, then can peace still be achieved by chance? In order to prevent the degree of disharmony and inequality from increasing further, we cannot but quickly and effectively sanction the facts of aggression and oppression. Responding to the war is an unavoidable request, and there is no other way to seek peace. Since they have abandoned the responsibility of serving as a bastion of the kingly way, we cannot shirk our duty. For the sake of acting on behalf of Heaven (the kingly way), for the sake of world peace, for the sake of the fate of Asia, for the sake of the continuation of Eastern culture, and for the sake of national survival, what other paths can we follow besides sacrificing ourselves for righteousness? We deeply hope that the people of the country will be of one mind and one heart, and under the leadership of the leaders, march forward in an orderly manner, work together to overcome difficulties, and strive for justice and peace. Why should we care about success or failure? The light of Asia's future can only be found in the midst of artillery fire. Today, we can only find it in this. It is fate. It is revolution. Why hesitate? (12th Central News Agency Telegram)

### Armed Police Guard the British Concession Post Office in Tianjin

British Government Studies Response to Japanese Memorandum's Procedural Errors

[Tianjin] The Japanese authorities sent a memorandum to the Consular Corps, stating their intention to take over the British Concession Post Office, the wireless telegraph office, and the French Concession's Chinese telegraph office. The Consular Corps has remained silent regarding discussions with the Japanese authorities on this matter. However, it is rumored that both sides view procedural errors in the memorandum as the cause of the misunderstanding, which has now been clarified. Meanwhile, the consuls, including the British Consul, are awaiting instructions from their respective governments, so the matter is currently stalled. The Japanese authorities have repeatedly attempted to enter the telegraph and telephone offices without success. The British Concession Post Office is now guarded by armed police. According to non-official sources, demanding that a Chinese organization hand over the post office to the Japanese is unprecedented. Public opinion holds that the political situation in North China is still undecided, so this matter cannot be discussed. (Central News Agency, 12th)

[London] The Japanese Consulate in Tianjin informed the Consular Corps yesterday that Japan would soon take over the Chinese Post Office and wireless telegraph office in the British Concession, as well as the Chinese telegraph office in the French Concession. After this news reached here, the British government is now studying how to respond. Officials believe that the Chinese Post Office in the British Concession of Tianjin is subordinate to the Tianjin Chinese Postal Administration, which is now in the hands of the Japanese authorities. Establishing an inspection agency is very easy and there is no need to set up another mail inspection agency in the British Concession. (Havas, Central News Agency, 12th)

[London] Reuters reports that since the Japanese expressed their intention to take over the Chinese Post Office in the British and French Concessions of Tianjin, the British government has been actively considering the new situation in Tianjin. This is because the Japanese action would put British mail in Tianjin at risk of being inspected by the Japanese. However, what kind of attitude the UK will adopt is still unknown.

### Japan's Deployment of Large Numbers of Warships to Shanghai Causes Considerable Unease in London

Japanese Troops Occupy Tianjin Post Office; Britain, America, and France to Protest

[London] This morning, all British newspapers prominently featured the sudden tension in Shanghai, accompanied by photos from the 1932 Shanghai Incident. However, due to the short time frame, there was no time for commentary after receiving the news. The danger in Shanghai, compared to the conflict in North China, naturally attracts more attention from the British public regarding the true nature of Japan's harm. Although the government has not yet seen detailed reports, it does not want to ignore the severity of the situation. It is expected that the government will make every effort to persuade China and Japan in the hope of easing the situation and avoiding the danger of a prairie fire. However, Britain will not take coercive action. It is believed that many influential Japanese are also alarmed and uneasy about the current trend of affairs in China. According to observers, the Japanese Navy's demonstration in Shanghai may not be aimed at provocation, but rather to make the Shanghai public, the nerve center of China, aware of the strength of the Japanese military and understand Japan's determination to achieve its ambitions in North China. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 12th)

[London] People here are currently pessimistic about the Sino-Japanese situation. Recent developments in Shanghai have caused increasing anxiety. However, a mutually acceptable peaceful resolution is not absolutely hopeless. According to stock market brokers, today, both Chinese and Japanese bonds fell compared to last night, China by 2% and Japan by 1%. Market conditions are normal with very little trading. In fact, the price decline is due to a lack of buyers, not pressure from sellers. Sellers are not selling en masse, otherwise market prices would be even lower. (Central News Agency, 12th)

[London] After the incident at Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport, Japan suddenly dispatched many warships to the Huangpu River. After this news reached London, the general public has been deeply impressed, believing that these warships, including cruisers, have a shallow draft and can sail up the river, heading for Nanjing. If so, the conflict between China and Japan will become generalized. Military figures in Britain believe that if China lays mines on the Yangtze River, Japanese warships will not be able to sail upstream. (Havas, Central News Agency, 11th)

[London] As the situation in the Far East becomes increasingly tense, there is considerable unease here. It is said that the British government is maintaining close contact with the US and French governments. It is also said that after Japanese troops occupied the Tianjin Post Office, the British and French governments are expected to issue a joint protest. (National Maritime Telegraph, 12th)

### Japanese Militarism Promotes US-Russian Cooperation

If Japanese Troops Invade Outer Mongolia, the Soviet Union Will Take Action

[Moscow] Japan has now begun to invade northern China again, and its actions may expand Japan's sphere of influence to the border of Outer Mongolia. In light of this, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs is taking advantage of every opportunity to express its shared emphasis on the amity between Russia and the United States to the American people. After US Secretary of State Hull issued a declaration on the 16th of last month explaining his peace policy, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov was the first foreign official to respond. Litvinov also took the opportunity to reiterate the proposals previously put forward by his country at the disarmament conference, advocating the establishment of a permanent peace conference to respond to Hull. Regarding the relations between Japan and Russia, sources say that if necessary, the Soviet Union is prepared to retreat to the Ural Mountains to avoid war with Japan. Recent events such as the Heilongjiang incident and the robbery of the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin show that the Soviet Union does not intend to be easily drawn into the vortex of Far Eastern disputes. However, if Japan attacks Outer Mongolia, the Siberian Railway will be seriously threatened, and the Soviet Union will naturally abide by its mutual assistance obligations to Outer Mongolia and take action. As for the rumored secret agreement between China and Russia, Japanese sources here have no knowledge of it and say that there is also no evidence to date regarding the Soviet Union's supply of arms to China. (Havas, Central News Agency, 11th)

[Moscow] Observers recently stated that the attitude of Britain and France toward the Spanish issue, and especially the Far Eastern issue, has disappointed the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now making every effort to approach the United States and trying to encourage American public opinion to pay attention to the Sino-Japanese disputes in the Far East, believing that the only country that can make Japan back down is the United States. In addition, the rapid fall of Beijing also disappointed the Soviet newspapers, believing that the loss of Beijing was due to the activities of traitors and Japanese spies, similar to how the city of Bilbao in Spain was misled by the spies of a certain faction in Toros. It is reported that those conspirators at the time gave the Nationalist army a map of the "Iron Belt Line" outside Bilbao, which resulted in its being captured in one fell swoop.

### Typhoon Moves Toward Fujian and Zhejiang Coasts

[Nanjing] According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, the typhoon had moved to the sea about 400 kilometers northeast of Taiwan on the afternoon of the 12th, with its center located between 126 degrees east longitude and 25.5 degrees north latitude. It is moving northwest-west, and the speed has decreased, but the wind force is very strong. Strong winds and rain have occurred in the East China Sea. If the wind direction does not change, the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang will be attacked. (Central News Agency, 12th)

### Yu Fu River Breaches Its Banks, Flooding Jinan's Northern Commercial Port

50,000 Citizens Defend and Block the Flood All Night; Water Level in the Middle Reaches a Turning Point

[Jinan] The Yu Fu River breached its banks tonight, and the water has flooded the northern commercial port and factory area. Many factories are surrounded by water. The River Bureau has formulated a plan to divert the flow on one side and block the source on the other. Because the breach is a vast expanse of water, with no soil to be found, it was decided to transport materials by boat to block it, and 200 large boats of the Yellow River Commission were prepared to transport stone. Yesterday, the flow at the breach was 500 cubic meters per second, the water level was one meter away, and today the flow has decreased to 400 cubic meters per second, the water is one meter lower, gradually reaching a turning point. Residents of the northern commercial port are relocating to the southern commercial port to avoid the flood. 50,000 citizens are building embankments and blocking the flood all night, illuminating the area like daytime. (Special Dispatch, 12th)

[Jinan] The water level in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is slightly decreasing today, while both upstream and downstream are rising. (Special Dispatch, 12th)

[Jinan] This morning, the water from the breach of the Yu Fu River flowed eastward along the Xiaoqing River, passing through the northern commercial port. The water is flowing in low-lying areas, and the houses have not been flooded. However, the road from the city to Luokou has been blocked by water. 50,000 citizens set out to build an embankment along the south bank of the Xiaoqing River to prevent the water from flowing south. This morning, the water level of the Yellow River at Luokou has fallen by 1.8 inches, and there has been a turning point. (Special Dispatch, 12th)

[Jinan] The water from the breach of the Yu Fu River on the morning of the 11th first divided into two streams, flowing eastward and then into the Xiaoqing River, flowing southeast. At 6:00 PM, it had reached the Yanmazhuang Kuangshan area, 18 miles from Jinan, and the flow rate was slow. The provincial government summoned technical personnel from various agencies and the Flood Prevention Committee, and the military and civilians worked together to prevent the flood from affecting the provincial capital. The water level is four to five feet deep. The Jinpu Railway intersects the city, and the embankment on the north side is more than ten meters high. At the time of the breach, they were blocking the culvert to prevent water from coming south. (Special Dispatch, 11th)

[Nanjing] The Yellow River's surge is of great concern to all sectors. According to relevant sources, the flood season of the Yellow River will end around August 10th at the latest, after which there will be no danger. Recently, the water in the Shandong section of the Yellow River has risen sharply due to the passage of a hurricane and continuous heavy rains, and the river channel is narrow and cannot flow smoothly. Although the civil embankment of the Meng River has collapsed, it is still far from the main dike, and the water level upstream is not high, causing damage in the Liangshui area. There is also flooding in the Central Canal, and the reasons are similar to those of the Yellow River, but the damage is not very heavy. The water level in the Xiang River was quite dangerous a few days ago, but it has gradually decreased after the 10th. (Central News Agency, 12th)

### Xiang River Continues to Rise

[Hankou] According to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, the middle reaches of the Xiang River have experienced repeated heavy rains, and the water level has been rising since the 11th. At 6:00 AM on the 12th, the water level at Yun County was 5.30 meters, an increase of 0.41 meters compared to 6:00 AM on the 11th. At Laokou, it was 86.85 meters, an increase of 0.49 meters. However, at Guicheng Nanhekou, it was 90.25 meters, a sudden increase of 3.13 meters, which is particularly serious. The bureau has telegraphed the various engineering offices and requested the provincial government to instruct the counties along the Xiang River to continue to take strict precautions together. It also noted that the water level at Shayang reached 43.9 meters at 3:00 AM on the 10th, which is one inch higher than the flood level of 1935. At present, dangerous projects have emerged one after another between Shayang and Xiantao, and the engineering office is working with the county magistrates to collect laborers to protect them day and night. However, the frequent heavy rains have affected the rescue work. (Central News Agency, 12th)

### Huai River Breaches Embankment in Huaiyuan

[Bengbu] The Qian River in Huaiyuan surged, and the Xinkou Dui was breached by the Huai River flow. The coast was immediately transformed into a vast expanse of water, flooding more than 4,000 mu of fields. The disaster is very serious. County Magistrate Wen Yi personally led the officers to supervise the blocking. (Central News Agency, 12th)

### Ferry Overturns at Fenglingdu

More Than Seventy Passengers Drown

[Taiyuan] The water level of the Yellow River has been rising in recent days. On the 9th, a merchant ship in Fenglingdu, Yongji County, carrying more than 80 passengers and a large amount of goods, was traveling from Tongguan to Shaanxi. When the ship reached the middle of the river, it overturned due to being overloaded and the ship's state of disrepair. River water flooded the interior, causing the drowning of more than 70 passengers. Only four or five people were spared. (Central News Agency, 12th)

[Xiamen] Many Chinese staff on Japanese ships traveling from Xiamen to Kaohsiung in southern China on the 13th voluntarily resigned. The "Lushan Maru" arrived in Xiamen yesterday and was immediately replaced with all Japanese crew. (Special Dispatch, 12th)

### Japanese Troops Attack Jinghai Unsuccessfully

Our Troops Fight Valiantly

Jinan Correspondence: Recently, Japanese troops at the northern end of the Jinpu Line suddenly attacked south, breaking the temporary truce. On the night of the 8th, Japanese troops attacked Jinghai. After our troops fought bravely in response, a fierce battle lasting two hours ensued. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated north, withdrawing to the vicinity of Duliu Town. Our troops advanced to Jinghai Station and the surrounding area north of it. After our troops retreated north, they rushed to build fortifications in Duliu for days, and actively transferred reinforcements from Tianjin. On the morning of the 9th, many newly arrived Japanese troops arrived in Duliu, and the Japanese artillery from Liangwang was also moved to Duliu. At the same time, our troops were deployed in Jinghai, preparing for a fierce battle. Also, at about 8:00 AM on the same day, two Japanese aircraft arrived in Jinghai to scout and strafed the station at low altitude, fortunately without causing casualties. At about 11:00 AM, four more Japanese aircraft flew to the bird factory to scout and dropped three bombs, all of which landed outside the station. Two bombs exploded, but did not cause any casualties. At 2:00 PM, Japanese troops suddenly came south from Duliu again, attacking Jinghai. Our troops bravely fought back, with one soldier worth a hundred. For a time, the fierce fighting was extremely intense. The Japanese troops were unable to cross the line and returned to Duliu, and the sound of battle ceased. (9th)

### Fujianese Prepare for Wartime

— Led by the Anti-Enemy Relief Association —

Fuzhou Correspondence: Various sectors of the population in Fujian Province believe that the overall situation is becoming increasingly serious and have begun to prepare for wartime.

### Ancient Temple Ruins from the Ming Dynasty Discovered in Anhui; Secluded Cave Used to Hide Beauties

Bricks and Stones in the Cave Are Exquisitely Beautiful

Huizhou Correspondence: There is a mountain named Wulishi, located 15 miles from Changxi, She County, which is majestic and precipitous, as high as the clouds. The mountain carbon is the peak of Wulijian, and the terrain at the top of the peak is flat. Over the years, it has been reclaimed and cultivated by mountain farmers, turning barren land into fertile land. Recently, a farmer was working on the mountain and struck something with his hoe, hearing a sound. Upon careful examination, he uncovered a large stone slab, engraved with delicate and beautiful patterns. Flipping the stone over, he discovered a large cave, about ten feet deep. The bricks and stones inside the square cave were all carved with flowers, exquisitely beautiful. The farmer went down the mountain and told the story, which deeply moved the curiosity of the general public, who flocked to see it. According to elderly farmers in nearby villages, in the Ming Dynasty, there was a Tiehu Cave Monk Temple on the mountain, similar to the former Honglian Temple. Because the abbot used a kind of evil art to lure young women into the cave as a place to hide beauties, the people at the time could not interfere. Later, it was destroyed by lightning, and the temple disappeared. Now, the mountain farmers have removed all the carved floral bricks and stones in the cave to avoid the abandonment and damage of antiquities in the field and are carefully preserving them.

### Random Notes from Rural Hubei

— Cheng Jun

"Night Boats" of Konglong

Traveling ninety miles east from Wuxue to Xiaochikou, one enters the territory of Huangmei. This place originally belonged to Jiujiang County, Jiangxi, and was managed across the river. The Executive Yuan, in order to facilitate administration and manage the construction and defense of river dikes, specifically assigned it to Huangmei. It has only been a few months since the transfer. At that time, someone suggested merging the area south of Konglong, which belonged to Mei, with Xiaochi to establish a new riverside county. However, it was considered unnecessary and was abandoned. Xiaochikou is located on the north bank of the Yangtze River and faces Jiujiang across the river. There are commercially operated ferries connecting the two places. Hundreds of shops sell cotton and grain, which are mostly exported from here, so there are many cotton and grain shops. The farmland in the nearby Fengyi and Feng'er Townships is very productive, but the terrain is low-lying and prone to flooding. All rely on the river dikes for protection. From here to Konglong, all belong to the lower townships of Huangmei, also known as water townships, which are divided into eight major enclosure areas. The safety of the people's lives and property depends entirely on the dikes and enclosures, so repairs and defenses are carried out with great effort.

Between Xiaochi and Konglong, a journey of forty miles, there is a small port named Jiagang, which can be navigated by sailboats. It is the main means of transportation, mostly traveling at night, called night boats. Amidst the rippling green waves, they weave back and forth like shuttles, with fishing songs answering each other, leaving a leisurely aftertaste that captivates the soul. This is during the summer, and the joy of night sailing outweighs the hardship. If it is in the cold winter, with wind and snow mixed together, and hard ice touching the face, then the skin will crack with every touch, and there is only hardship without joy. There are a total of more than 300 of these small boats. Whether carrying people or goods, it only costs five or six jiao per trip. Half of the boatmen are farmers, and half are professionals. In the past, local ruffians and bullies organized so-called "wharves" and forcefully collected "wharf fees," taking up to 60% of the earnings. For example, if the boat fare was five jiao, the boatman would only get two jiao after working hard all night, while the ruffians and bullies would sit and collect their share. Nothing in the world is more unfair than this. This had been going on for many years, but the county government could not effectively crack down on it, and it even produced various reactive effects.

Konglong is an important market town in Huangmei. Most of the streets are on the dike. Because it is located at a transportation hub, commerce is still prosperous. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wu Shangda, is courageous and willing to take responsibility. The construction of electric lights and other facilities were accomplished through his efforts. The county's first primary school is located here and is well managed. From Konglong to the county seat is fifty miles, and it can be reached by wheelbarrow (earth cart). In the past, it was a post road, paved with stone slabs, making it very convenient for travelers. In 1928, a county magistrate surnamed Li built another motor road, forcibly occupying farmland as a base, and dug up the stone slabs from the old road. When it rained, the muddy ground would engulf the wheels. Not only did the motor road never connect to the warehouse, but the old road also became impassable. To this day, the farmers whose land was occupied and the rickshaw pullers who are inconvenienced by the road all criticize him. This shows that every time something is done, if it is not first considered for the benefit of the people, the result will inevitably be failure. However, this road is still important, and it should be repaired as soon as possible to facilitate transportation.

On the road to the county, one passes through the Baihu Ferry, which is said to be the ancient Zhaokai, but this cannot be verified. However, the county is actually located at the border of Wu and Chu, and the former course of the Yangtze River was indeed between Xiaochi and Konglong. It seems credible that Zhaokai was located here. Thirty miles further is Shilipu. During the Taiping Rebellion, it was a military stronghold. Qing officials such as Zeng Guofan, Bao Chao, and Duolong'a, as well as Taiping Heavenly Kingdom King Chen Yucheng, fought hundreds of large and small battles here. Desolate tombs stand everywhere, the burial places of these brave soldiers. To this day, the name "Four-Eyed Dog" still resonates among the people. Now the county is the thoroughfare connecting Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. If there is a military incident, it will still be a hotly contested place.

The city walls of the county seat are high and majestic, and rivers surround it. When bandits were rampant, they attacked the city with several divisions. Because the squad leader Ma Yao Kui fought bravely and the people worked together, the surrounding villages were red-colored. However, the small isolated city was preserved and never fell. The whole territory is still considered peaceful. The county middle school is located outside the south gate, the central primary school is located in the city, and there is also an education center with very complete equipment.

The entire county is divided into four districts, half of which are mountainous, known as the upper townships, and half of which are waterlogged, known as the lower townships. The upper townships often suffer from drought, and the lower townships often suffer from floods. The main agricultural product of the upper townships is rice, and the main agricultural product of the lower townships is cotton. In years of good harvest, in addition to self-sufficiency, some can also be shipped out for sale. The people are kind and hardworking, know etiquette and abide by the law, and are known for being easy to get along with. However, since 1926, they have been disturbed by red bandits, and in addition, there was a major flood in 1931 and a major drought in 1934. The rural economy has been completely bankrupt. The farmers in the surrounding villages are scantily clad and cannot get enough to eat. The people living in the mountains do not even know what flavors are like. In the past, when faced with disasters, they could still travel together to other places to escape famine, but now this is also prohibited. In the midst of poverty, they do not even have time to save the dying, and officials urging the collection of taxes are still constantly knocking on the door, even using the status of disaster victims who "cannot live without relief" to receive relief money on one hand and use it to pay taxes on the other. This kind of contradictory thing makes people laugh and cry.

### Jiangyin

A Traitor Arrested in Xiagang Town

On the afternoon of the 10th, a man from north of the Yangtze River, Yan Zhongxian, was found loitering on the streets of Xiagang Town in the Seventh District, copying down house numbers and spying on the Tiecheng Road. He was spotted by Fu Bingtai, an investigator from the First Squad of the Security Team, who stepped forward to arrest him. He was taken to the headquarters of the Eleventh Battalion, where copper coins and a dark mark of "Red Line 60" on his collar were found. On suspicion of being a traitor, he was taken to the county for questioning and detention.

### Wuxi

Protecting Highway Bridges

With the situation in Hebei critical and national distress severe, Magistrate Long Tiyao of this county is deeply concerned that unscrupulous traitors might take the opportunity to disrupt public order and damage transportation. Having been ordered to pay close attention to highway bridges within the jurisdiction, he issued orders to all districts on the 10th, instructing the heads of townships, villages, and baojia along the three highway lines of Xicheng, X湾 (Xiwan), and Xiyi to rotate strong laborers to guard the bridges day and night.

### Yangzhou

County Chamber of Commerce Stabilizes Finances

Due to the serious situation and the lack of a standard exchange rate between legal tender and copper coins, the exchange rate has recently plummeted to over 3,800 文 (cash) per yuan. The Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting at 10 a.m. on the 10th, gathering representatives from Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks, as well as Shixing, Dexing, Shengyu, and other money shops and tobacco and exchange businesses, to discuss measures to stabilize the situation. They resolved to adhere to the Ministry of Finance's order that each yuan should not be exchanged for less than 3,000 文 (cash), with violators to be punished as disrupting financial order. A notice was submitted to the county government to announce the exchange rates on the signs of tobacco and exchange businesses, prohibiting the hoarding of copper coins for speculation. Exchange businesses were allowed to collect handling fees for incoming and outgoing transactions. The public was encouraged to report any instances of non-compliance, and the county government was requested to order police and security agencies along the river to strictly prohibit the export of copper coins to maintain the market. The banks were also requested to transport auxiliary currency to Yangzhou as much as possible for circulation.

### Ningbo

Traitors Attempt to Destroy Railway Tracks

At 5:30 p.m. on the 9th, the railway tracks of the Yongcao Railway, 46 kilometers east of Yuyao Station, were found to have been set on fire with kerosene poured on the sleepers. Fortunately, a patrol team from the Yao City Public Security Bureau was passing by and extinguished the fire with water. Only half a track was burned, and station staff were dispatched to repair it. Police Chief Wang Kaiye questioned farmers in the fields, who said that two people had been seen loitering there, but they had not paid attention and did not know if they had committed arson. It is suspected that traitors attempted to destroy the railway tracks and disrupt transportation. The incident was reported to the government authorities, who telegraphed nearby military and police to strictly apprehend the culprits. The railway authorities also telegraphed all stations to be vigilant.

### Hangzhou

More Traitors Apprehended

As various counties in Zhejiang Province have discovered traitors, the military administration has been paying close attention to their arrest. Over 40 people have been successively apprehended and handed over to the Security Command for interrogation. Recently, another seven or eight people were apprehended, including several who were seriously involved. One was found stockpiling rosin near the aviation school with the intention of arson. Another was apprehended at Minghu Bathing Pool, carrying 700 yuan in cash and over 5,000 yuan in bank deposits. He claimed to have worked as an engineer on the PingSui Railway and had intended to sabotage the railway. Another was arrested at the Huaxing Hotel, and two appointment letters from the puppet state of Manchukuo were found, along with hidden markings on his shirt. They are currently under strict interrogation, and the search continues to ensure no one escapes. Xia Dehou, a traitor apprehended in Yuyao, has been executed by firing squad.

Building a Dam at Guanyintang

Guanyintang on the north bank of the Qiantang River is subject to severe erosion from tidal surges. To maintain the safety of the embankment, the Water Conservancy Bureau has been approved by the provincial government to allocate funds to build two spur dikes to divert the flow of the river. Construction began last month and has been progressing rapidly. The stone block work for the length of the dam has been completed, and the width work is 50% complete. If the supply of stone materials is sufficient, it is expected to be completed on schedule by the end of September.

### Taizhou

Unscrupulous Merchants Buying Wheat

Unscrupulous merchants in Taizhou, Haidou, and other places have been buying wheat from Jianhai, Wenling, Huangyan, and other counties since the new wheat crop came on the market in early summer. Some farmers, greedy for temporary small profits, have been selling wheat, causing the price of wheat to soar. According to investigations, since the new wheat came on the market until recently, about 100,000 bags have been loaded onto ships and exported to Shanghai, Ningbo, and other ports. Recently, these unscrupulous merchants have been buying and hoarding wheat due to the tense situation, hoping to make huge profits in the future. However, as the wheat in Jianhai, Wenling, and Huangyan has been bought up, they have sent people to TianTai, XianJu, and other townships to continue buying. It is reported that the authorities have already issued a ban, but these unscrupulous merchants still hold export permits obtained in the past, so they are still buying in the countryside. Whether they can still export is still a question.

### Shijiazhuang on the National Defense Line

— Xi Min

Before the Pinghan Railway was opened to traffic, Shijiazhuang was just a small village where dozens of farmers lived. Later, with the opening of the Pinghan Railway and the Zhengtai Railway terminating here, the population increased greatly and commerce prospered. Various factories, such as spinning, glass, match, and tobacco industries, were established one after another. After one or two decades of operation, it has now become a large town with a population of 60,000.

After the opening of the Zhengtai Railway, coal, cotton, and other miscellaneous grains produced in Shanxi Province were exported from here, transferred to Pinghan trains, and shipped to Tianjin for sale at home and abroad. Therefore, although Shijiazhuang is within the jurisdiction of the Huolu County District of Hebei Province, it is in fact the only economic, political, and military throat of Shanxi. The day after the reporter arrived in Shijiazhuang, he visited Manager Wu of the Shijiazhuang Central Bank. According to him, the value of coal from Shanxi coal mines and Jingxing coal mines that is transported through Shijiazhuang each year exceeds 10 million yuan, and the total amount of cotton and agricultural products from Shanxi that are exported through Shijiazhuang each year after autumn is about 40 to 50 million yuan. This further proves the importance of Shijiazhuang's position.

In the process of intensifying its aggression against Hebei and peeping into Shanxi, the enemy had long paid attention to Shijiazhuang. In the past, the Japanese loudly advocated the Cangshi Railway or the Jinshi Railway, both of which terminated in Shijiazhuang. If the Jinshi line, which the Japanese had been dreaming of, were one day built, the enemy's railway could quickly reach Shijiazhuang from the Beining Road from Tanggu via Tianjin, and further penetrate into Shanxi! At that time, the towering Taihang Mountains would probably not be able to stop the enemy's rampant advance!

However, the enemy's conspiracy ultimately did not succeed. The bloody battle at Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) has awakened the masses of the whole of China! China has stood up and will no longer retreat step by step! The enemy has probably fully realized that threats and deceptions can no longer smoothly complete their "cleverly seize" aggression policy! Really! Unless North China is turned into scorched earth, China is determined to use flesh and blood to limit the enemy's aggressive tentacles—the completion of the Jinshi Line. The Jinshi Railway is probably going to become a historical term!

After the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, the atmosphere in Shijiazhuang naturally became tense. The trains going up the line were busy all day, and the locomotive whistles kept making wild howls! The people of Shijiazhuang, who are full of wartime life experience (there were civil wars on the Pinghan Line during the Beiyang government era), know this very well. On the 27th of last month, the situation in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin) suddenly changed, and Baoding became the only military and political center in Hebei. Japanese planes flew to Baoding one after another to bomb. Shijiazhuang is the most important place south of Baoding, so Japanese planes often patronized it to spy, and often swept down with machine guns. On the 4th of this month, a certain unit stationed here on orders fired at the enemy with anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, but did not hit.

Most of the people doing business in Shijiazhuang are clients from Shanxi. In the past few days, many wealthy merchants who have money and nothing to do have reportedly left here for Shanxi. However, this is only a small minority. After the reporter arrived in Shijiazhuang and strolled through the streets, the shops were still operating as usual, and the residents were very calm and not panicked at all. According to Manager Wu of the Central Bank here, in the financial aspect, only the banknotes of the Hebei Provincial Bank have been affected by the fall of Pingjin, but as a result of the three banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks, making every effort to maintain the situation, the market circulation is not inferior to other banknotes, so the finance is also very stable.

Before the Lugouqiao Incident, the local garrison was transferred to the front line. Although there were many troops coming and going here, they were all in transit, so there was a short period of time when there were no troops specifically responsible for maintaining the security of Shijiazhuang. After the 20th of last month, a certain unit was moved here to specifically take charge of the security of Shijiazhuang. As soon as the reporter arrived in Shijiazhuang, the impression he got of the garrison was that they were full of energy and strictly disciplined, and he felt very happy in his heart. The garrison commander is very serious about the air defense of Shijiazhuang. In addition to holding air defense exercises from time to time, he also sends brothers to inform residents along the streets about air defense methods. Since Shijiazhuang was bombed by Feng army planes when Shi Yousan, who was stationed here, rebelled in 1931, the residents have a more real understanding of air raids than the average inland residents! Almost every household has dug a cave to prevent airplanes from dropping bombs. Therefore, the air defense of Shijiazhuang is somewhat better than that of the inland areas.

In recent times, the traitors in the Shijiazhuang area have been quite rampant. The 4th of this month happened to be the first day the reporter arrived here, and eight more traitors were captured near the Pinghan and Zhengtai railway stations. Many destructive items such as hand grenades were found on them. According to the reporter's inquiries with the local military and police agencies, the total number of traitors captured in recent times has been no less than several hundred, but the detailed inside story cannot be known because the military law agencies are extremely secretive. However, it is said that a large-scale judgment will be made within days.

The issue of traitors in Shijiazhuang reminded me of a passage from someone on the train yesterday. The person told the reporter that the bombing of three ammunition cars in Baoding on the 30th of last month was suspicious. The military cars were parked in the station without any obvious targets or special reasons. The Japanese planes dropped bombs and hit the military cars accurately. Most people were surprised by the accuracy of the Japanese planes' bombing, so some people asserted that it was due to the traitors' tip-off. Whether this guess is true or false still needs to be thoroughly investigated, but today the traitor activity throughout the country is indeed a very serious problem. The reporter took photos along the way from Zhengzhou to Shijiazhuang, and was questioned by the military and police. It can be seen that the authorities are very serious about maintaining security and paying attention to and guarding against various suspicious people. This can make the traitors slightly restrained, but I always feel that the most effective way to punish traitors for disrupting the rear is to have civilian organizations carry it out. Therefore, the government in the future should pay more attention to opening up the people's national salvation movement and guiding the people's national salvation movement.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Responding to the Enemy's Conspiracy with Resistance

— Hua

After the Hongqiao Airport incident, the atmosphere in Shanghai suddenly became tense. We recognized from the beginning that this incident was a conspiracy by the enemy to provoke incidents as a pretext for a large-scale invasion of our Yangtze River basin. Therefore, when our municipal government authorities expressed a willingness to seek a solution through diplomatic channels with a fair and reasonable attitude, the Japanese side, on the one hand, engaged in frantic agitation, and on the other hand, made unreasonable demands on our municipal government. By the past two days, a large number of Japanese marines and troops had arrived, posing a clear military threat to us. We have completely understood the ambition of Japanese imperialism. Now we have no other choice but to respond to the enemy's conspiracy with resolute resistance.

Regarding the Japanese provocation in Shanghai this time, we must point out that its conspiracy has several motives. First, it believes that it can achieve the same effect in Shanghai by copying the old trick of invading Pingjin. Therefore, after the Hongqiao Airport incident, it agreed to mediation on the one hand, and on the other hand, it spread rumors and agitation and secretly mobilized naval fleets to come. As of yesterday, 28 Japanese warships were deployed in the Huangpu River, and the number of marines also suddenly increased from 3,000 to 7,000 to 8,000. Now it believes that the military deployment has been completed, so it does not hesitate to reveal its ferocious face and make open military threats. Second, after the fall of Pingjin, the strategy decided by the Japanese side was to temporarily suspend its advance on the Jinpu and Pinghan lines and first focus on developing the PingSui line. It attempted to seize Nankou while we were relatively negligent in Chahar and Suiyuan, occupy Chahar Province, and then enter Suiyuan, and then use its military superiority to turn around and plot to capture southern Hebei and Shandong provinces. However, the enemy artillery has been fiercely bombing Nankou recently, and we have been firmly defending it, and the attention of the whole country has been focused on that area, not allowing the invaders to carry out their ambitions again. Because of this, the Japanese warlords decided to use a strategy of attacking in the east and attacking in the west, harassing everywhere, and provoking conflicts in Shanghai to contain our military forces from going north. However, this strategy certainly does not mean that the Japanese side has "no territorial ambitions in Shanghai and the Yangtze River basin" (this is a common phrase used by Japanese imperialism). If Japanese imperialism feels that it can take advantage of the situation in this area, it will still brazenly disregard everything and occupy this place with a large number of troops, and then make overall military and diplomatic threats.

However, in today's situation, all the enemy's conspiracies have long been seen through by us. What the enemy calls "no territorial ambitions in North China" proves that it has ambitions to invade territory. What the enemy calls "not hoping to expand the Shanghai incident" proves that it hopes to expand the situation. Bombing Nankou with artillery and sending fleets to force Shanghai are ironclad evidence and need not be argued. However, in today's world, our country, whether above or below, has also learned a painful lesson from the enemy's conspiracy of aggression. We recognize that wherever the enemy goes, north or south, it is our front line. We know that any evasion, any concession, any illusion of compromise with the enemy is no longer possible. We can only respond to the enemy's conspiracy with resistance, and we can only repay the lesson the enemy has given us with a serious lesson.

The situation in Shanghai is on the brink of a major collision. We will not have the slightest retreat, nor can we have the slightest retreat. We must respond to the enemy's provocation conspiracy with all our strength.

### The Soviet Government Orders the Conscription of New Soldiers

All Have Received Strict Military Education; Ready to Strike Back at Those Who Strike

[Moscow] Today, the Soviet Defense Committee issued an order that all young people born in 1915 who were not conscripted last year must enlist in September of this year, and the 1916 class must also be fully conscripted. At the same time, junior officers and their assistants who have completed a certain period of military service in the Red Army and border or internal defense will be released on long leave. (Reuters, Moscow, 11th)

[Moscow] The News reports on the Red Army's conscription of new soldiers, saying, "The new soldiers conscripted by the Red Army this year are of unprecedentedly good qualifications. Most of them have graduated from middle school, and many of them are Voroshilov sharpshooters, cavalrymen, and parachutists, that is, talents who have received preliminary specialized training. In most cities and towns, one-quarter of those conscripted are Voroshilov sharpshooters, and there are many formally trained aircraft pilots. We will use this power to protect peace. Progressive people all over the world know that socialist countries volunteer for peace, but peace must be strengthened by the state to be guaranteed."

The Pravda said that the Red Army has a very high cultural level and is the best tactical and political school. "In 1912, 33% of Russian conscripts were illiterate, while only 3/10,000 of Soviet conscripts last year were illiterate. The enemy abroad is preparing to attack our country, but we are not disturbed at all. We are deeply convinced of our own power and are sufficient to win the final victory. The Red Army will strike back at those who strike, and crush the enemy at the place where they come from."

The Red Star said, "While the Red Army conscripts young workers and peasants into the army, it also dismisses tens of thousands of officers and soldiers who have received political and military training in the army to society. Factories, collectives, and state-owned farms will obtain a large number of fighters, workers, party, and Soviet organization talents who are loyal to socialism, leaders of collective farms, cultural workers, and active national defense guards. They have made great progress in military, political, and cultural aspects during their two years in the Red Army. They have a thorough understanding of combat techniques, and officers and political workers are especially full of revolutionary courage, full of Bolshevik awareness and military responsibility, and full of revolutionary vigilance and determination to eliminate the people's enemies." (Tass, 11th)

[Moscow] The Ashkhabad newspaper today carried a brief communiqué stating that the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic has been thoroughly purged, and many major government leaders have been dismissed, including the chairman of the Central Executive Committee, nine members of the Executive Committee, and the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, all of whom were called enemies of the people. Turkmenistan is the last of the Central Asian republics to be purged. In addition, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union has appointed Shaburova as the Commissioner of Social Welfare, the first woman to hold this position. (Reuters, 12th)

### Litvinov Goes Abroad for Vacation

The Vacant Post of Foreign Commissioner is Temporarily Held by Potemkin

[Moscow] Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov has taken a vacation, and the vacant post is temporarily held by Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin. (Tass, 11th)

[Vienna] Litvinov arrived here this morning and stayed at the Soviet Embassy, rejecting all social engagements and living in seclusion. It is reported that Litvinov came here purely to consult a famous doctor, Aibannre, and will soon transfer to Karlsbad, Czech Republic, for vacation. (Havas, 11th)

[Moscow] The Moscow Soviet Plenary Session decided that the former Moscow Soviet Chairman Bulganin has now been promoted to Chairman of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) People's Committee, and should be relieved of his original post. Sidolov was re-elected as Chairman of the Moscow Soviet. In addition, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Russian Federation decided to appoint Ms. Shaburova as the Russian Federation People's Commissioner of Social Insurance, and Batayev as the Food and Vegetable Commissioner. The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union removed Batayev from his original post as Deputy Commissioner of the Soviet Food Industry. (Tass, 12th)

### Italian Army Holds Grand Exercise

In Sicily

[Rome] The Italian Army is scheduled to hold exercises in Sicily from the 12th to the 18th of this month. Prime Minister Mussolini will go to observe the exercises and has arrived on the island. He issued a statement, stating that the eyes of the world are now focused on Sicily, and that a new stage in world history has now begun. This stage is mainly composed of the establishment of the Italian Empire, which is of great significance. The Prime Minister is now scheduled to deliver an important political speech at the Port of Palermo in Sicily after the end of the grand exercises. Most observers believe that this speech will be mostly directed at foreign countries. The Prime Minister delivered a speech in Milan on November 1 last year, explaining the outline of Italian foreign policy and first mentioned the "political axis" of Italy and Germany. The speech to be delivered at the Port of Palermo this time will roughly explain the situation in Europe, which has been improved, and that there is a real possibility of approaching between Britain and Italy, and that Italy and France can also approach each other, which is the best condition for maintaining a lasting balance in Europe. (Havas, 11th)

### Two Iraqi Military Officers Assassinated Together

⊙ Mosul: Iraqi Chief of Staff Siduoyi and Air Force Commander Jiawate were shot dead by a soldier while boarding a plane to Turkey to participate in army exercises. Many believe that the assassination of the two military officers together must be a political conspiracy. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)

⊙ Iraqi Capital: Iraqi Air Force Commander Jiewate was assassinated by soldiers in Mosul City last night. The murderer has been arrested. (Havas, 12th)

⊙ Iraqi Capital: Iraqi Army Chief of Staff Sitki went to Turkey today to observe the country's army exercises. (Havas, 12th)

### Brazil Borrows Warships from the United States

Argentina Strongly Opposes; the United States Claims Not to Discriminate Against Other Countries

⊙Argentine Capital: Argentine public opinion is still criticizing Brazil's plan to borrow six cruisers from the United States. Foreign Minister Lamas is still unwilling to express his opinion, but it is generally known that the Argentine Navy Department believes that this matter violates common practice and is enough to cause concern. A former customs officer recently told a reporter from Havas that Argentina recently sent a fleet of warships to travel to various ports in the Pacific Ocean and crossed the Atlantic Ocean to visit European countries. Brazil probably saw the strength of the Argentine fleet and expanded its navy. (Havas, 11th)

⊙Argentine Capital: The Argentine government strongly opposes the United States' plan to lend six destroyers to Brazil. The Navy Generals Conference held a meeting this month and immediately decided in principle to order one cruiser and seven destroyers from British shipyards. It is reported that these warships will not be delivered until next year. (Havas, 12th)

[Washington] Due to the desire to ease the emotions of various Latin American countries regarding the US government's plan to lend six destroyers to Brazil, Undersecretary of State Welles has reported to President Roosevelt, approving his invitation to the ambassadors of Argentina and Chile to hold talks and explain everything to them. He then issued a statement saying that the US government's move was to express friendship to Brazil and did not discriminate against other Latin American countries, and did not conflict with the London Naval Treaty. At this point, Welles presented telegrams from embassies stationed in various Latin American countries, and said that the negative impressions felt by these countries were not correct and would be dispelled within days. (Havas, 11th)

[Washington] Democratic Senator Walsh recently proposed a bill that would allow the United States to lend its warships to various South American countries for the purpose of training the naval personnel of those countries. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hold a temporary meeting tomorrow to discuss it. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, recently told the press that he believes that this proposal poses no danger to either the United States or the countries of South America. (Havas, 11th)

### Romania and Poland Establish Aviation Agreement

Planning Regular Routes

⊙Warsaw: According to official announcements here, the aviation agreement between Romania and Poland has been signed. According to the new agreement, the Polish "LOT" company will train pilots for Romania and jointly open a daily route between Warsaw and the Romanian capital with the Romanian ASTA company. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)

### Palestinian Christian Rights

Roman Curia Asks Britain for Protection; Arabs Oppose Partition

[London] British Catholic sources recently revealed that the Roman Curia submitted a document to the British government some days ago, outlining the rights of Christians in Palestine. It stated that unless these rights are guaranteed first, the implementation of the Palestinian partition plan would inevitably encounter serious obstacles. Furthermore, Palestine is the birthplace of Christianity, and it would be unthinkable to resolve the Palestinian issue without prior consultation with the Curia. Likewise, it would be inconceivable for the monasteries and religious organizations belonging to Christian churches within Palestine to be placed under the administration of either the Jewish or Arab communities. In addition, Orthodox Christian figures have stated that the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem also intends to raise the issue of the future status of Orthodox monasteries. In summary, British political circles now believe that the Palestinian issue is extremely complex. Therefore, whereas it was previously handled solely by the Colonial Office, henceforth, all diplomatic aspects of the matter will be handled by the Foreign Office. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)

[London] The Zionist Congress passed a resolution yesterday, endorsing the Executive Committee's engagement with the British government regarding the Palestinian issue. This action is tantamount to accepting in principle the partition plan proposed by the Royal Commission, but with the condition that it be more favorable to the Jews. It is reported that the Jews unanimously support this resolution by the Zionist Congress. However, the Arabs continue to express opposition to the partition plan in principle, arguing that according to this plan, the Jews would receive the richest coastal fruit-producing region and the Galilee region, which has the most olive groves. They also state that most of the railways and highways would be in Jewish hands, while the Arabs would receive barren mountains and other unproductive lands. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)

⊙ Jerusalem The Zionist Congress, which recently convened in Zurich, Switzerland, passed a resolution advocating for the acceptance in principle of the partition plan proposed by the British Commission. However, it stipulated that the Executive Committee should engage in negotiations with the British government regarding the establishment of a Jewish state. Jewish figures here have expressed considerable support for this resolution, but Arab figures are expressing extreme dissatisfaction, as they believe that the Jewish people have formally endorsed the partition of Palestine. It is generally speculated that this resolution will likely increase the anger of Arabs and Muslims towards the Palestinian partition plan. The Arab Higher Committee has reportedly received a letter from the leader of the Free Party in Tunis, French North Africa, protesting against this resolution passed by the Zionist Congress. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 12th)

[Geneva] A new Zionist movement was formed here today, led by the Russian anti-socialist Jabotinsky. It has already begun to criticize the resolution passed by the World Zionist Congress in Zurich, which advocates authorizing the Executive Committee to negotiate the partition of Palestine with the British authorities. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)

### Britain and Germany Continuously Expel Each Other's Journalists

France Also Expels a German Reporter

[Berlin] In retaliation for Britain's expulsion of three Berlin-based correspondents for German newspapers from London, the German government has also expelled Times correspondent Mr. Ebbutt. The Berlin Foreign Correspondents Association held a special meeting today, passing a resolution stating that the journalists express regret over the expulsion of the Times correspondent from Germany. The Association opposes in principle any government expulsion of foreign journalists due to their reporting activities. (National News Agency, via Haitian Telegraph, 11th)

[Berlin] Regarding the German government's order for the Berlin-based correspondent of the London Times, Mr. Ebbutt, to leave the country within two weeks, German political figures have commented after the Foreign Correspondents Association passed a resolution protesting the decision. They say that the activities of many foreign journalists in Berlin exceed the scope of their profession and conflict with German interests. The German government naturally reserves the right to take appropriate measures to stop such activities. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)

[Berlin] It has been confirmed here that Mr. Göss, a correspondent for the German News Agency stationed in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France, has received an expulsion order from the French Ministry of the Interior. Authoritative figures here have stated that this move is difficult to understand and seems unnecessary, as Mr. Göss is an intelligence officer for the German Embassy in Salamanca, and all of his diplomatic credentials state that he is to travel to Salamanca. Therefore, his presence in Saint-Jean-de-Luz is only temporary. In any case, he is expected to depart France to take up his post. (National News Agency, via Haitian Telegraph, 11th)

### Abyssinian Emperor Appeals for Restoration of Lost Territory

[London] Emperor Selassie of Abyssinia today issued another appeal to the Christian churches, requesting that the League of Nations restore the territorial integrity of Abyssinia in accordance with the Covenant, and hoping to awaken the world's sympathy and gain the support of the churches. He concluded by vehemently protesting against Italy's rule in East Africa. (Haitian Telegraph, 12th)

### German Giant Aircraft Tests Transatlantic Flight

[Berlin] The German aircraft "Nordmeer," the world's largest seaplane, departed from Travemünde this morning and arrived in Lisbon in the afternoon. It will fly to New York, marking the first step in Germany's plan to establish a transatlantic airmail service to compete with the aviation businesses jointly operated by Britain and the United States. The "Nordmeer" is a four-engine aircraft with a speed of 162 miles per hour. It carries a crew of four. The pilot is Mr. Blangenburg, who has crossed the South Atlantic a total of 43 times. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 11th)

### Egypt Imports Military Supplies

⊙ Cairo The British ship "Prince of Sicily" has arrived in Alexandria, carrying 75 cannons and a large amount of military supplies. Recently, a large batch of military supplies has also been transported to the country. (Haitian Telegraph, 11th)

### Germany Utilizes Garbage

[Berlin] General Göring, the dictator of the Four-Year Plan, issued an order yesterday, instructing all municipal authorities in cities with populations of less than 35,000 to pay close attention to household and factory waste. All waste that can be used for remanufacturing or has practical applications should be utilized as much as possible, with particular attention to household waste, as factory waste has often already undergone a utilization process. It is believed that this measure will result in a large amount of metal, fiber, rubber, and other raw materials that can be remanufactured, thereby alleviating the shortage to some extent. (Haitian Telegraph, 12th)

### Drought in Southern United States

[Washington] The Department of Agriculture announced today that a severe drought has occurred in the United States. Rainfall is scarce in the Great Plains region north of Texas, and the entire region is experiencing drought conditions, with the most severe conditions in western Oklahoma and northwestern New Mexico. The water level in the Mississippi River basin fluctuates frequently, and there are many areas with insufficient rainfall. Although wheat has already been harvested there, corn may be damaged. (National News Agency, 11th)

### British Ambassador Visits Xu Mo

[Nanjing] The British Ambassador, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, accompanied by Secretary Puckerford, visited Xu Mo at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at approximately 4:00 PM on the 12th for discussions, departing after about several tens of minutes. (Central News Agency, 12th)

### The Urgent Transportation Problem Today

— Rui Ling

The moment is pressing! We are intensifying our preparations for this time of crisis. This is a critical juncture for our nation to gamble on survival and resolve to live or die. We must exert every last bit of strength, shed every last drop of sweat and blood, and sacrifice everything we have to secure the dignity and survival of our nation.

Let's start with the most pressing points regarding transportation. The government officials in charge have probably already taken note of these or are already preparing for them. However, based on what I have thought of personally, I will bring them up again. Perhaps the wisdom of the many can provide points for reference. These are just some principles that do not seem to involve any confidentiality, so I am publishing them publicly, hoping to elicit more thorough opinions.

We are a weak country, and our first resolution when fighting foreign aggressors is to make sacrifices. In explaining the final moment in his speech, Mr. Wang Jingwei put forward the "scorched earth (resistance policy)" and gave the most thorough and clear explanation. Although this is a harsh sacrifice, it is an effective means of dealing with the enemy. In enemy-occupied areas, only piles of rubble remain. The enemy loses the target for economic exploitation. I ask you, even if some domains are captured, what is the significance to the enemy? The enemy wants to take over Tianjin and Pingjin in perfect condition, just to keep Tianjin and Pingjin as their supply base in the rear!

We must resolve to implement a scorched earth policy when dealing with the enemy. We must implement a strategy of fortified walls and clearing the fields! We must use a war of attrition, a war of consumption! Guerrilla warfare!

Therefore, in the areas we can protect, we must desperately protect everything. In the areas we cannot protect, we should relocate important items to safer areas in the rear as much as possible. When the final moment arrives, we should resolutely destroy everything so that the enemy cannot benefit. This is especially true for transportation equipment:

The past facts cause us too much pain! The September 18th Incident in Shenyang, not to mention the major losses of territory, sovereignty, and people, and the decline of the nation's and state's position, even in terms of transportation, the loss of vehicles is unknown! Vehicles can be moved at any time. After September 18th, railway transportation between Guanwai and Guannei was not completely cut off. As long as the person in charge of transportation (at that time, transportation in the Northeast was completely controlled by Gao Jiyi) paid a little attention, many vehicles in Guanwai could have been transferred to Guannei. However, as a result, even the vehicles of the Beining Railway itself were intercepted by the pseudo-Fengshan Railway! During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Jinghu Railway also suffered extremely heavy losses. Although the matter was rushed and there was no time to prevent it, if the Jinghu Railway authorities had been prepared early, they could have at least reduced the losses!

It has long been known that North China will inevitably be the target of Japanese aggression! However, the Tangshan Locomotive Factory of the Beining Railway and the Changxindian Locomotive Factory of the Pinghan Railway are both located where Chinese railways have large-scale engine factories, and I have never heard of any preparations for relocation. Now they have all fallen into enemy hands! Enemy troops are stationed in the Tianjin, Tanggu, and Shanhaiguan areas, but the Beining Railway is now actively seeking to restore traffic! Who is the traffic being restored for? Who are the troops being transported for?

We will not talk about past events now. If we pay attention in time, we can still salvage a part.

① Among the Chinese railway locomotive factories, the Qingdao Locomotive Factory of the Jiaoji Railway is relatively large in scale. It is said that its scale is comparable to the Tangshan Factory of the Beining Railway. Important parts should be relocated as soon as possible to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy again. The Pukou Locomotive Factory of the Jinpu Railway and the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory of the Jinghu Railway are also under considerable threat from Japanese gunboats on the Yangtze River and aircraft in the air. The Railway Department originally had a plan to establish a general engine factory in Zhuzhou. Now that the situation is tense, it may be difficult to deliver ordered parts on time. It is better to relocate important parts from each railway factory to Zhuzhou or within Jiangxi Province first. In the future, major vehicle repairs will be the responsibility of the general engine factory, while minor repairs will still be handled by local factories on each railway.

② Railway workers, especially those with technical skills in engine, engineering, and vehicle services, should be closely organized to advance and retreat with the military, to avoid being forced or used by the enemy. Those who are still driving vehicles on occupied railways, such as the various railways outside the Guanwai in the past, the pseudo-Fengshan Railway, and the current Beining Railway, are mostly former employees who continue to serve, giving the enemy great convenience. The majority of this responsibility should be borne by the past road administration authorities, because a group of middle and lower-level employees cannot retreat to the rear, and after staying in the local area, they are either threatened by force or oppressed by life, so they have to endure the pain and continue to serve on the original line. Is this their wish? A small number of those who escaped from the enemy's forces to the rear were not provided with accommodation by the road administration authorities, causing them to be displaced. This is tantamount to indirectly promoting employees to remain on the original line to serve the enemy. Therefore, in the future, employees on each railway line in the military zone should be militarized and closely organized to increase the effectiveness of military transportation when advancing and to make an orderly retreat when retreating. Even if the enemy occupies our railway line, it will not be easy to restore traffic for a while. At a minimum, this should be done for technical employees.

③ A railway demolition and repair worker team should be organized immediately, adopting military training, so that they can engage in railway demolition and repair. Before retreating, if it is estimated that a counterattack is impossible, the rails and bridges should be thoroughly destroyed in the quickest way possible. When advancing, they should also be able to repair the rails and bridges in the shortest possible time to facilitate military transport. The destruction of the enemy's rear transportation should be the responsibility of the guerrillas in the army, but railway personnel should be taught demolition techniques and provided with the necessary tools. In this incident, we did not do serious demolition work on the rails and bridges of the Beining Railway, we were not able to withdraw the vehicles of the Beining Railway to the south, and we did not make a planned retreat for the employees of the Beining Railway, so in a few days, it immediately became the enemy's main route for transporting troops, grain, and weapons. This kind of mistake should never be repeated in the future.

### Japanese Warships and Soldiers Gather in This Port; The Situation is Serious

Japanese Spies Infiltrate to Probe Our Preparations; Residents in Wusong, Jiangwan, and Other Places Flee in Droves; Frontline Sentries and Plainclothes Units Open Fire to Provoke

According to reliable news this morning, there were no changes in the Japanese military lines last night. However, after 2:00 AM this morning, a small number of frontline infantry units and plainclothes units began to move around east of the Yokohama River and the Qingyun Bridge. They opened fire three or four times around 3:00 AM this morning to provoke, but our side remained calm and did not respond.

After 2:00 AM this morning, our reporter drove to various places bordering the Public Concession and Zhabei for a final inspection. All the iron gates connecting to the Chinese areas were tightly closed, with armed members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps guarding each location. The streetlights in Zhabei, though still as bright as before, illuminated roads completely devoid of people, presenting a desolate scene. It was as if a state of war had already silently descended.

The situation in Shanghai was very tense yesterday. As a result, residents from areas such as Wusong, Zhabei, and Jiangwan packed up their belongings and rushed to move into the concession areas. Cars, rickshaws, and moving trucks were all hired, especially rickshaws. Rickshaw pullers took the opportunity to raise their prices and profit from the situation. Even for a short distance, some were charging more than half a yuan. The frenzy of moving did not subside until late in the evening. At the same time, to maintain order, the concession authorities dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives to guard the borders between the Chinese areas and the concessions, so no disturbances occurred.

Around 10:00 PM, because Japanese troops were mobilized in large numbers and many Japanese spies infiltrated our transportation routes and public places to gather information, our side made considerable preparations for self-defense. At the same time, the areas bordering the Public Concession and the Chinese areas were concerned about unexpected incidents or petty criminals causing trouble, so it was announced that all iron gates at the border between the Chinese areas and the concessions would be closed at 8:00 PM that evening. The reporter went to check the area north of Suzhou Creek at 9:50 PM and saw that the iron gates at Kaifeng Road, Qipu Road, Gansu Road, Haining Road, North Zhejiang Road, Avenue Road, Kannan Road, North Shanxi Road, North Henan Road, Bazih Road, and North Sichuan Road were indeed closed. At the same time, the Western troops of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were also ordered to deploy. The Hongkou Police Station also dispatched additional Chinese and Western armed detectives to assist in maintaining order in various places. Trolley cars on Routes 5, 6, and 7 of the Public Concession were all returned to the depot after 9:45 PM. Only Routes 1 and 2, which ran between North Sichuan Road, Bazih Road, Jing'an Temple, and Waiyangjing Bridge Jing'an Temple, continued to operate. In addition, only Route 18 of the trolleybuses, which ran between Yuezhou Road and Xieqiao, did not stop, but the number of vehicles had been reduced, so passengers were very crowded. The shops in the central areas of the British and French concessions remained open, but the shops near the borders between the Chinese areas and the concessions closed early, and some did not open at all.

Yesterday, the Xinsheng News Agency reported that Britain, the United States, and France were all preparing to increase their troops in Shanghai. The French army was being transferred from Annam, and 400 soldiers arrived in Shanghai by ship last night. Another 400 were scheduled to arrive next week. The British army and the US Marines were about to depart from Hong Kong and the Philippines, respectively. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the Public Concession and the White Russian Regiment in the French Concession had already been deployed last night, guarding the main intersections on the borders of the two concessions. Detectives from the police stations of the two concessions were all dispatched to jointly maintain public security.

### Ten Japanese Warships Sailed Out of Shanghai Yesterday

Their Movements are Mysterious and Unpredictable; Five More Ships Arrived in the Afternoon; Foremen Resign from Work

The Japanese warships that had sailed to Shanghai from Sasebo unloaded a large amount of military supplies and marines in Shanghai the night before. Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, some Japanese warships sailed out, and more continued to enter. Five Japanese warships entered the port: the destroyer "Ren" at 5:50 AM, two destroyers of the 16th squadron at 10:00 AM, another destroyer of the 16th squadron at 10:10 AM, and the destroyer "Shiretoko" at 1:25 PM. It was reported that there were still nine ships lurking outside the Wusongkou, including an aircraft carrier. However, some also sailed out, and their movements are unknown: the destroyer "Mu" at 6:20 AM, the gunboat "Yae-yama" at 6:25 AM, the destroyer "Hozumi" at 8:50 AM, the destroyer "Hatsuharu" at 1:25 PM, the destroyer "Natori" at 1:45 PM, the destroyer "Hatsukumo," the destroyer "Hatsukumo" at 1:50 PM, the destroyer "Kinu" at 2:10 PM, the cruiser "Yura" at 2:30 PM, and the destroyer "Wakaba" at 2:40 PM, for a total of ten ships that sailed out. According to the Xinsheng News Agency's investigation with the Customs, as of last night, there were a total of eighteen Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River, excluding those that sailed out. Also, the destroyer that arrived yesterday was led by the Ren ship, which had sailed out the day before. Finally, a very large transport ship, fully loaded with military supplies and marines, arrived in Shanghai, with the ship name Shiretoko. After these five Japanese warships entered the port, they docked at the NYK and Mitsui wharves. Both wharves are in Pudong, so a large number of armaments and marines were unloaded at the warehouses on the Pudong side.

Japanese warships are constantly arriving in Shanghai and unloading large quantities of military supplies. The aforementioned warships loaded with military supplies are all docked at the Huishan, Osaka, and Huangpu wharves in Hongkou. The unloading of military supplies is all done at night and stored in the warehouses at the three wharves, with Chinese laborers doing the unloading work. A small foreman, Li Yongji (Chinese), has been the general foreman for the small laborers at the Osaka wharf for many years. This time, because he was disturbed by the large amount of military supplies being transported to Shanghai by Japanese warships, poisoning his compatriots, he resigned from his job with the Japanese boss at 9:00 AM on the 11th and led his small laborers away from the wharf. Now, Li Heting, the Chinese compradore of Osaka, has been appointed as the acting general foreman, and he has appointed He Shicai from Dongtai and Wang Changbin from Taizhou as foremen to recruit a general group of Jiangbei laborers to take over the work yesterday morning. At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, a warship docked at the Osaka wharf, and the newly hired workers transported the military supplies from the ship to Warehouse No. 11. According to small laborers at the Huishan wharf, on the 27th of last month, a Japanese warship docked at the wharf, and the small foreman Wu Longji supervised the small laborers in transporting 600 boxes of poison gas bombs from the ship at night, with each box containing six bombs (rectangular, about three or four feet long), which were all stored in Warehouse No. 4 of the Huishan wharf, preparing to release them during the war.

### The Jinghu Passenger Train Stopped Running Yesterday

After the situation in Shanghai suddenly became tense yesterday, the North Railway Station was also designated as a guarded area. The night express train that departed from Beijing on the Jinghu Railway at 11:00 PM the night before was delayed until yesterday afternoon due to crowded passengers, and it only arrived in Zhenru. All passenger trains, except for the express train, which departed as usual at 8:00 AM, were delayed. The express train at 8:35 AM was delayed until 10:30 AM. After 10:00 AM, all trains were not dispatched. The two railway bureaus also posted notices at the Jielu gate stating, "Passenger tickets for all trains at this station are temporarily suspended." The passenger trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway continued to operate as usual, but passengers had to get on and off at the South Station, and there were occasional delays. The vehicles on the Sihhu Highway and the Hutai Highway were all suspended yesterday. Waterway transportation, such as the Sanbei, Ningshao, China Merchants, and other inland river steamship companies, continued to operate as usual. All passengers traveling to the Yangtze River and Ningbo, Zhenhai, Huzhou, Pinghu, and other inland areas were unusually crowded. A Nanjing dispatch on the 10th reported that four Jinghu trains were dispatched on the 12th, at 7:50 AM, 8:20 AM, 6:00 PM, and 12:40 AM, all to Suzhou. The fast express, special express, and night express were all suspended. The night train from Shanghai to Beijing arrived at 2:00 PM, and the fast express arrived at 8:00 PM.

### Chinese Ships Will Completely Suspend Service Starting Today

All Ships Sailed Out of Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; Passenger and Freight Shipments Have Also Been Stopped

The situation in Shanghai was very tense yesterday. The Japanese residents who had evacuated from various places along the Yangtze River had all boarded the ships. Because there was a hurricane at sea, they changed their departure to today and will be sent back to Japan. Yesterday noon, Chinese merchant ships unanimously decided that the Mingxing, Xinming, Xinjiangtian, Ningxing, and other ships that were carrying passengers fleeing to the Yangtze River and Ningbo would all sail out early. The Xinjiangtian and Ningxing ships sailed out at 12:00 PM, and the Mingxing and Xinming ships sailed out of Shanghai at 4:00 PM. The China Merchants Bureau's Haiyuan ship also urgently left Shanghai for Hong Kong at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. All Chinese Jianghai ships in Shanghai had left Shanghai completely yesterday, leaving no ships in Shanghai. Therefore, starting today, the Shanghai Chinese merchant ship companies, whether state-run or civil aviation, will have no ships operating on their original Yangtze River, Nanyang, and other routes, and will be almost completely suspended. Even if one or two ships are operating, they will be temporarily scheduled based on the situation. Also, starting at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, passenger services and customs declaration services on various routes in the Yangtze River and the North and South Seas have stopped accepting passenger and freight shipments. The goods stored in the warehouses that could be moved were moved to safer areas for storage. The inland river ships on the Suzhou River were fully loaded with passengers heading to various places inland. Starting today, all Chinese ships in Shanghai's sea transport will stop sailing. Only the Taikoo and Jardine ships of foreign merchants are still operating, but they are not transporting any freight. They are only providing transportation for passengers fleeing.

### Daily Necessities Must Not Be Manipulated or Price Gouged

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a public notice to all stores regarding daily necessities, stating that they must not be manipulated or price gouged: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order relaying a telegram from the Ministry of Industry stating, "Considering the current serious situation, regarding the prices of daily necessities in various regions, we are sincerely concerned that unscrupulous people will engage in speculative manipulation, causing abnormal fluctuations in prices. We must take measures to prevent this and ensure the people's livelihood. The bureau is hereby ordered to pay close attention to this, consider the local situation and implement appropriate measures, and report for review." Considering the current serious situation, we have reached an extraordinary period. All daily necessities must not be arbitrarily manipulated or price gouged in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. In addition to the previous report, the Chamber of Commerce is ordered to comply and immediately implement the necessary measures and report back for verification. This is a strict order. At this critical moment, if one engages in hoarding and cornering the market, taking advantage of the danger to profit, it is no different from exploiting the blood and sweat of fellow compatriots to enrich oneself. All merchants in the city should thoroughly and vigorously caution themselves against this. Otherwise, once reported and verified, the Chamber of Commerce will have no choice but to petition the responsible government authorities to punish the violators according to law. This is a public notice.

### Important Speech by Mayor Yu

Expressing Deep Regret over Japan's Dispatch of Large Numbers of Warships to Shanghai; Sincerely Hope That Citizens Will Remain Calm and Fulfill Their Responsibilities as Citizens

Regarding the recent developments in the situation in Shanghai, Mayor Yu issued the following statement yesterday afternoon: Since the unfortunate incident at Hongqiao Airport occurred, our side decided to investigate with a sincere and impartial attitude in order to seek a resolution through diplomatic channels. However, while the Japanese side stated that they would await the investigation and agreed to a diplomatic solution, they also dispatched large numbers of warships to Shanghai and landed many troops, which is close to a threat, and is deeply regrettable. The residents of the city are unsettled, and seeing this situation, they naturally feel uneasy. Moreover, with rumors flying and widespread speculation, people are becoming increasingly panicked. As the mayor, I sincerely hope that all citizens will do their best to remain calm, fulfill their responsibilities as citizens, and exhibit their inherent conscience. Do not panic or cause disturbances. Be united and trust the government, calmly await the development of the situation, and jointly seek a way to resolve the national crisis. Those who spread rumors and disrupt public order will be dealt with according to the law and will not be tolerated.

### Ceasefire Agreement Joint Committee Held Meeting Yesterday

Responding to a Request from the Japanese Side, They Demanded That Our Side Withdraw Troops; Mayor Yu Sternly Refuted This; The Meeting Was Fruitless

The Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement Joint Committee convened a meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting hall at 3 PM yesterday, responding to a request from the Japanese side. Participants included Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun, the representative from our side, and Consul General Okamoto, the representative from the Japanese side, as well as representatives from the four countries of England, France, America, and Italy.

Okamoto First Addressed the Meeting; First, the Japanese representative Okamoto addressed the meeting, saying that the Chinese representative had informed him yesterday that the security forces near the Japanese residential area had retreated, but this morning, the security forces and regular troops had set up defensive fortifications in the suburbs. This action violated the ceasefire agreement and the Joint Committee should pay attention to it and take effective measures to stop it.

Mayor Yu Sternly Refuted This; After Okamoto finished speaking, Mayor Yu refuted his speech with a stern attitude and words, saying, "After hearing the words of the Japanese representative, I deeply feel that the Japanese representative believes that the Joint Committee was established solely to satisfy the demands of the Japanese side. This kind of thinking is completely wrong. The purpose of establishing the Joint Committee is to maintain peace and order in Shanghai, not to assist the Japanese government in implementing its policy of aggression. The Japanese representative is using the representatives of neutral countries as his tools, utilizing them when needed and discarding them when not needed. Is this not extremely wrong? I say this with reason. Last year, the Japanese troops invaded the Baziqiao area. According to the provisions of the ceasefire agreement, the Japanese troops should have withdrawn from that area. Therefore, the ceasefire agreement has long been destroyed by the Japanese troops' act of bad faith. It should be known that the ceasefire agreement is only effective if both parties abide by it. If only one party abides by it, it will not help in practice. Now that the ceasefire agreement has already been torn apart by the Japanese side's violation, the Chinese representative believes that the Japanese side has no basis to make any further proposals based on the agreement. This is the first point that should be noted. Secondly, after the unfortunate incident at Hongqiao, the Japanese side repeatedly stated that it would await the investigation of the facts and resolve the matter through diplomatic channels. However, on one hand, warships were gathering, troops were greatly increased, and military supplies were also replenished in large quantities. In addition, a large number of warships are on their way, continuously arriving. These measures not only endanger the safety of foreign nationals in Shanghai, but also pose a threat to China, and are sufficient to cause harmful actions. China, in its own territory, naturally has the right to take self-defense actions. I did indeed inform the Japanese representative yesterday that our security forces had retreated slightly from the area near the Japanese residential area. This was an announcement made in my capacity as mayor. At that time, I also protested to the Japanese representative about the gathering of Japanese warships and troops in Shanghai. The Japanese representative at that time replied that he did not know about the increase in Japanese troops. However, not long after, I verified that Japanese warships and troops had indeed increased significantly. Therefore, for the sake of defense, the security forces naturally cannot withdraw. In short, our side adheres to the consistent policy of 'We will not offend others unless they offend us,' which has been established by the central government. We will continue to protect foreign nationals residing in Shanghai and respect the interests of foreign nationals as usual. Please convey this to the foreign nationals."

The Meeting Ended Fruitlessly; At this point, the representatives of various countries suggested whether the security forces could be slightly withdrawn to avoid conflict. Mayor Yu immediately replied that the ceasefire agreement had already been destroyed by the Japanese side, so there was no need to convene the Joint Committee today. However, the representatives of various countries are acting as mediators in their capacity as consuls, and I am also very willing to discuss the matter. However, our troops have absolute freedom of action on our own land, and this does not allow others to interfere. For the sake of maintaining peace and security in Shanghai, if Japan withdraws the increased warships and troops, then our side is willing to consider withdrawing the security forces. The Japanese representative did not give a concrete answer on this point. Therefore, the meeting was fruitless. However, both representatives stated that they would make every effort to avoid the outbreak of hostilities. The meeting adjourned at 5:15 PM.

### Municipal Party and Government Agencies Unite to Organize National Salvation Work Groups

Over 140 National Salvation Groups; Disorganized Organization Should Be Merged and Eliminated

Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the tragic fall of Beiping and Tianjin, anti-enemy groups in the city have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. In addition to the general organization of the Municipal All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, and groups such as the labor, peasant, and cultural groups establishing separate National Salvation Associations to assist the work of the Anti-Enemy Support Association, according to investigations, there are already over 140 other scattered national salvation groups. After consultations between the municipal party and government agencies, all agree that the national salvation work of various groups demonstrates the people's patriotic enthusiasm, which is commendable. However, they are concerned that there are too many groups and the organization is disorganized. They are sincerely concerned that unscrupulous people, or traitors, may use the name of resisting the enemy to secretly provide aid to the enemy. In order to eliminate abuses, concentrate strength, and improve anti-enemy efficiency, they have sent personnel to conduct detailed investigations and have drafted plans to unify national salvation work, merge groups with similar characteristics, and resolutely eliminate bad groups.

### Wang Xiaolai Broadcasts a Speech: All Citizens Should Defend Shanghai

Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech on the China-West Radio last night, calling on all citizens of Shanghai to defend Shanghai with all their strength. He said, "Fellow citizens, we have truly reached the final moment. Everyone should just bury their heads in work. Those with strength should contribute their strength, and those with money should contribute their money. I feel that for the sake of the country, shedding blood, sweating, donating money, and donating goods are all the most glorious and valuable actions. We all do not want to be slaves and do not want to be traitors. Everyone feels the same way, so what else is there to say? I believe that the central government's attitude of resisting the enemy has now been clearly demonstrated, and they are preparing to take on the responsibility of defending our territory. Then, we Shanghai people, who live here, eat here, and raise our children here, should of course all rise up to defend this place to the best of our ability for the sake of the country and for the sake of ourselves. Now, all the banks, money houses, and newspapers are collecting national salvation donations. I predict that tomorrow morning, many patriotic compatriots will definitely be waiting at the doors of banks, money houses, and newspapers to enthusiastically contribute donations to save the country's life, to save the nation's life, and also to save their own lives and save the lives of their children and grandchildren. If everyone does this, every family does this, then not only can Shanghai be defended, but the Chinese nation will definitely be revived. Based on the principle that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, I believe that my patriotism will not lag behind others, and others' patriotism will also definitely not lag behind me. I hope that everyone will not slack off in the responsibilities that they should fulfill in their positions, and will not retreat. With utmost sincerity and single-mindedness, the country can be saved. I also hope that patriotic compatriots will not easily believe the rumors deliberately created by traitors, who are trying to confuse public opinion and discredit the reputation of organizations. I have lived in Shanghai for over thirty years, and my actions have been clear to everyone. Whenever rumors abound, I just laugh them off, believing that they are not worth debating. I urge all Shanghai compatriots to use their full strength to defend Shanghai at this time of life and death, and do not relax or delay and ruin yourselves. Shanghai will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate!"

However, some unpatriotic citizens are willing to act as traitors, either spying on military intelligence for the enemy or providing them with grain, provisions, and military supplies. The harm they inflict on the nation and the danger they pose to the lives of our people are even greater than the enemy's aggression. If they are not punished according to the law, how can we uphold law and order? This city, being a commercial port and the financial center of the nation, is also at the forefront of national defense. Allowing traitors to lurk here would have a tremendous impact. Therefore, our associations, in a joint meeting, have resolved that traitors harm the nation. In addition to our associations instructing our respective district branches to strictly investigate and prevent such activities, we request that the police authorities severely punish them according to the law for the crime of endangering the nation, in order to serve as a warning. We respectfully submit this petition based on our resolution, and we earnestly request that your esteemed government (department) consider and implement it to maintain order." Presented by the Citizens' Association of the First Special District, the Citizens' Association of the First Special District, the Citizens' Association of the Hu Nan District, and the Citizens' Association of the Hu Bei District.

### Municipal Government Issues Instructions Regarding Filing Procedures for Merchant Associations

The Municipal Government received a communication from the Ministry of Industry yesterday regarding the matter of merchant associations submitting filings for registration. It stated that due to incomplete procedures or non-compliant regulations, the process of investigation, verification, and correction often takes a considerable amount of time. In order to streamline the filing process, the Ministry has formulated instructions regarding the filing procedures for merchant associations and requests that they be circulated for compliance. The Municipal Government has already instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to circulate these instructions for compliance. The original text of the aforementioned instructions is transcribed as follows:

㊀ All charters and lists submitted by merchant associations for registration should comply with the amended guidelines for the articles of association of chambers of commerce and industrial associations issued by the Executive Yuan, as well as the format of their lists. Unless there are special circumstances, no additions or deletions should be made lightly. ㊀ The organization, establishment, reorganization, restructuring, and re-election of merchant associations should all be noted with the date in the submitted documents. ㊀ After the election or replacement of committee members, it must be reported within fifteen days. ㊀ For organizations that are being established, the permit number from the Party Headquarters should be noted. For organizations that are being reorganized or restructured, it should be stated that the reorganization has been approved by the Party Headquarters and the competent government agency. ㊀ If a merchant association has been reorganized or restructured in the past, the registration should start from the date of the reorganization or restructuring. Previous lists do not need to be resubmitted. ㊀ When reporting a re-election, if any committee members from the previous term have resigned or been replaced, but the report was not submitted due to special circumstances, it should be explained in detail in the submission to avoid discrepancies. ㊀ When reporting a re-election, if there are no changes from the previous term, it is not necessary to resubmit the charter. ㊀ The original list of committee members at the time of organization was called the "First Term." To avoid confusion with the "First Re-election" and "Second Re-election" during re-elections, the term "Term" should be omitted, and it should be directly called "List of Committee Members Elected at the Time of Establishment." Subsequently, it should be called "List of Committee Members Elected at the Time of the First Re-election," "List of Committee Members Elected at the Time of the Second Re-election," and so on. If it has been reorganized with the permission of the Party Headquarters, it should be called "List of Committee Members Elected After Reorganization." If it has been restructured with the approval of the local competent government agency and the local Party Headquarters, it should be called "List of Committee Members Elected After Restructuring." The date of election should be noted on each list. ㊁ For the current term of elected member representatives, all names should be listed sequentially before the membership list. If it is not possible to list them before the membership list of the chamber of commerce, the words "Elected Committee Member of the Current Term" should be noted under the name of the representative for easy verification. ㊀ When re-electing, the words "Retained" or "Newly Elected" should be added to the lower right of each committee member's name on the list of committee members. ㊀ In the format of the list of committee members of the trade association, the "Type of Business" column should be filled in with the industry specified in the name of the association. ㊁ The representatives appointed by the members of the trade association are limited to "managers" or "principals." If the number of employees in a store is between eleven and twenty, one additional employee representative should be appointed. For those with twenty-one to thirty employees, two should be appointed, and for those with more than thirty-one, three should be appointed. The number of employee representatives is limited to three. The "Position in Store" column should only note "Manager," "Principal," or "Employee," and no other names should be used (such as director, assistant, accountant, partner, etc.) to avoid ambiguity.

### Sufficient Supply of Rice and Wheat in the City

According to the "Shen Shi" News Agency, the Coarse Grains and Rice Industry Association has established a Sales Committee. In light of the tense war situation and the impending outbreak of full-scale resistance, the supply of rice and grain in the city is crucial to the people's livelihood. To avoid a last-minute scramble, the Association has been conducting a thorough survey of the city's rice reserves. It has been learned that the Association has already registered the amount of rice stored in various merchants' stores, which amounts to 400,000 shi as of recently. The supply is sufficient, and the people of the city need not worry about their food.

According to the "Da Gong" News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance issued an order prohibiting the export of wheat and the transshipment of flour out of the province, most of the flour mills in the city have reduced production or ceased operations. The sales of wheat have also been affected. Currently, the total amount of wheat stored in various warehouses in the city is approximately 440,000 dan. The number of foreign wheat stored in various flour mills is also considerable. As for the wheat reserves in the wheat-producing areas in various inland provinces, they are quite substantial. Although international transactions are still possible, they are subject to various procedural restrictions, which greatly delay transportation. In addition, the hot weather makes it easy for red spots to appear on the wheat during transportation by boat and vehicle, which reduces the gluten content of the flour.

### National Goods Factories Association Requests Banks and Money Shops to Continue Lending

The Shanghai National Goods Factories Association, in view of the fact that commercial banks and money shops in Shanghai are mostly tightening their lending, refusing to pay out to manufacturers with existing overdrafts, and even only accepting deposits but not making payments, and after receiving remittances from other places, deducting them from overdrafts and completely stopping mortgage loans, believes that if this continues, various factories will inevitably stop production due to lack of capital turnover, resulting in the unemployment of hundreds of thousands of workers, which will have a huge impact. Therefore, yesterday, it submitted a petition to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, ordering the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, as well as the Shanghai Banking and Money Shops Association, to organize a wartime economic committee, establish fundamental measures for the wartime economy, lead the industry and banks, and order them to continue lending to maintain the original overdraft amounts of various accounts, so that factories can operate and avoid bankruptcy.

### Public Utilities Bureau Provides Relief to Unemployed Chauffeurs

Automobile Repair Mechanics Can Also Go to Designated Locations to Register

The Public Utilities Bureau of this city, in view of the fact that there are a large number of unemployed chauffeurs and automobile repair mechanics recently, in order to meet the needs of the extraordinary period and to relieve these unemployed workers, has specially organized the registration of automobile drivers and automobile repair mechanics. The regulations stipulate that all unemployed chauffeurs and automobile repair mechanics who have obtained licenses in this city can register in order to find employment. Unemployed automobile drivers can register at the Driver Examination Office of the Public Utilities Bureau at Fenglin Bridge. Unemployed automobile repair mechanics can register at the Apprentice Examination Office of the Public Bus Management Office at 252 Xie Xu Road.

### Municipal Associations Continue to Collect Scrap Copper and Iron

### Relief Work Suddenly Becomes Tense Amidst Serious Situation

Relief Society Has Already Transported Thousands of Refugees Lake Society and Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Begin to Take in Refugees

Yesterday, the situation in this city suddenly became serious. Refugees fled from the Wusong River, Jiangwan, Dachang, and Zhabei areas. Various relief agencies, various sectors, and various groups in this city rose up to engage in relief work and were responsible for working all night. The situation is recorded as follows:

Relief Committee

Yesterday, refugees fled from the Wusong River, Jiangwan, Dachang, and Zhabei areas. The Relief Committee of this city, from 9:00 a.m. to the evening, dispatched five large trucks from the reception team to transport more than 2,000 refugees to Renji Hall on Yunnan Road for centralized registration in batches. Then, they were sent to various shelters for temporary accommodation. More than 20 shelters have been designated throughout the city. Each shelter accommodates between 60-70 and over 100 people. The committee has assigned administrators to assist the supply team in handling food and other supplies. The work is extremely tense. All members of each team worked all night. Because there are still a large number of refugees who have not been transported out, they are scheduled to continue to depart at 4:00 a.m. this morning to continue the transport. After being sent to various shelters for temporary accommodation, they will be sent back to their hometowns in batches by the repatriation team at any time. The committee has also found the Great World, Guang'en Temple, Buddhist Pure Land Society, Qingliang Temple, Jiangning Guild Hall and other places for accommodation. As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, more than 500 refugees had registered. It has been decided that each shelter will provide two meals a day. At the same time, it is contacting automobile and shipping industries and other transportation agencies to supply vehicles and ships for the repatriation of refugees back to their hometowns when necessary.

Taijiabao Three Counties

Baoshan, Jiading, and Taicang counties are adjacent to Shanghai. Since Japanese ships have come to Shanghai one after another, residents have moved to Shanghai to take refuge. The fellow villagers associations of the three counties in Shanghai held a joint meeting at 304 Pudong Building on Pudong Avenue at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss relief matters. More than 50 people, including Jin Jushan, attended the meeting and decided to establish a Refugee Relief Association of Taijiabao Three Counties, and elected Zhang Gongquan as the chairman. Fellow villagers of the three counties who have any liaison matters can go to 304 Pudong Building on Aidaoya Road.

Charity Associations Federation

The Charity Associations Federation of this city held an emergency meeting at the meeting place at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. Representatives of charity organizations, including Wang Yiting, and other fifty people attended. Qu Wenliu chaired the meeting. After the meeting, the chairman first reported on the situation of refugees flocking into the concession to avoid the war. Then, they discussed how to provide relief and accommodation, and decided as follows: (1) Each charity organization should allocate a considerable number of houses to accommodate as many refugees as possible. (2) Allocate funds separately to prepare various supplies for accommodating refugees. (3) Negotiate with various hometown associations to assist in sending them back to their hometowns.

World Red Swastika Society

After the World Red Swastika Society established the Southeast Joint Relief General Management Department of the World Red Swastika Society in Shanghai, it is actively preparing to set up temporary hospitals and shelters for emergency needs. The department sent a letter to the Shanghai Charity Associations Federation for Disaster Relief yesterday, requesting assistance. The letter stated that if the disaster of war unfortunately breaks out, our relief team can set out to provide relief.

International Relief Society

The International Relief Society, jointly organized by various charitable organizations such as the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Righteous Relief Society, the World Red Swastika Society, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Chinese Catholic Action Society, the Chinese Jisheng Society, and the Charity Associations Disaster Relief Society, plans to invite consuls from various countries and Western business leaders to participate. The association is now ready and is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting at the Banking Association at 5:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month.

Local Muslim Association

The Muslim Association of this city, in order to prepare for the relief of Muslim victims in the disaster area during the extraordinary period, organized the Shanghai Muslim Association Disaster Relief Association and held a meeting yesterday.

Lake Society Reception Team

The Reception Team of the Lake Society Temporary Relief Fellow Villagers Committee on Guizhou Road, in view of the tense situation in Shanghai and the panic among the people, and the fellow villagers residing in Zhabei and Hongkou districts fleeing in droves, and some even having nowhere to live, began to take in refugees from today. The location is in the hall of the society, and they will be sent back to their hometowns at any time. In addition, the Repatriation Team of the association has scheduled a special ship to join the Shenhu Line starting tomorrow to escort fellow villagers back to their hometowns.

Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association

The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai held a standing committee meeting yesterday to discuss the formation of a special committee to prepare for handling the relief of fellow villagers.

### Garrison Headquarters Executes Six Traitors Yesterday Morning

All Confessed to Being Directed by the Enemy to Spy on Military Intelligence and Sabotage the Rear

Since the North China Incident occurred, the enemy has been buying Chinese people to serve as traitors, mixing in various places to spy on military intelligence and take on the work of disrupting the rear, or supplying the enemy with various military supplies. These traitors willingly accept the enemy's instructions and are scattered in various districts of Shanghai. The police authorities of this city have arrested many traitors in recent days and sent them to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation. Among them, Ji Bohua, Zhou Miaogen, Huang Xunnian, Zhao A'er, Liu Baorong, Liu Zhenxue and other six people, after several interrogations by the military law office, all confessed to being hired by the Japanese side, with a monthly subsidy of 16 to 20 yuan. They were specifically responsible for spying on military intelligence and sabotaging the rear. It has been confirmed that the facts are true. They were executed by the headquarters yesterday morning.

### A Tour of Zhabei Under Wartime Conditions

Since the Japanese bandits occupied Tianjin and Beijing, their navy stationed in Shanghai has also been eager to try. They land and parade every day to demonstrate their power. The merchants and residents of North Shanghai were originally startled birds and feared that the tragedy of the January 28th Incident would be staged again. Therefore, those who were slightly wealthy moved in advance to avoid the fierce flames. When the situation seemed to ease slightly the week before, and the authorities indicated that there was no need to worry about public order, the trend of relocation was slightly curbed. Unexpectedly, the Hongqiao Airport Incident suddenly occurred a few days ago. The Japanese side actually assembled 28 warships in Shanghai waters and made unreasonable demands on our municipal government, hoping to achieve their goal of threatening our side to submit, which caused the situation to suddenly become serious. The entire Zhabei has completely entered a wartime state. The residents in the area and the neighboring areas of Kun all moved to avoid the war. From morning to night, they never stopped. The number of stores that temporarily closed down was countless. The Hongkou, Huishi, and Diswei Road police stations all increased the police force at the junction with the Chinese territory to maintain the security of the Public Concession. The various situations are described as follows:

Relocation

Starting yesterday morning, all those who lived in the Zhabei area and in the Kun neighboring Zhabei moved to the south of Suzhou River. The roads from north to south were almost occupied by handcarts, cars, collapsed carts, rickshaws, and pedicabs. The most crowded places were North Zhejiang Road, Fujian Road, North Henan Road, and North Xizang Road. Among them, poor families who could not afford to hire a car carried things on their shoulders, carried them on poles, or carried them in their hands. There were also those who were carrying babies and running away in a hurry. The tragic situation of being displaced was even worse than the January 28th Incident. The most crowded times were 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. In these two times, all kinds of small vehicles were connected from the old garbage bridge to the boundary road, and there was no room for insertion. By 7:00 p.m., it was still not sparse. Therefore, after yesterday's thorough movement in the North District, the remaining population was indeed very small.

Closing of Markets

Yesterday morning, there was only relocation in the North District, and there was no other action. By noon, the stores near the station automatically closed down one after another, and soon spread to North Zhejiang Road, Aierjin Road, Haining Road, North Shanxi Road, North Henan Road, Laobazi Road, North Sichuan Road, and other places. By the afternoon, the number of stores closing down on the various roads increased with time. After dusk, there were even completely closed and no one was open.

Police Force

Yesterday noon, the Hongkou, Huishi, and Diswei Road police stations increased the number of Chinese, Western, Indian, and Japanese detectives to guard each section of the junction between the North District of the Public Concession and the Chinese territory. The minimum number of guards was two per post, and the maximum was four, six, and eight. In addition to patrol detectives, they shuttled back and forth. If there were idle people gathering, they were immediately persuaded to disperse. The police force at the boundary road opposite the North Station and the intersection of Baoshan Road on North Henan Road was the strictest. All the iron gates installed at the boundary had been repaired and perfected. Each iron gate was specially assigned a main detective to manage the opening and closing in case of emergency. It was said that the several iron gates at the intersection of Baoshan Road on North Henan Road, the intersection of North Shanxi Road and the boundary road, and the intersection of the target road connecting the Chinese territory were going to be closed first at 7:00 p.m. As for the bunkers built by the Public Works Department in the past at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road on Haining Road and the target road, etc., they have now been arranged in them. However, so far, there have been no troops stationed in the bunkers. The barbed wire that is indispensable in every accident has not yet been arranged at the junction of the Chinese and Concession territories during the day, but by the evening, workers have already loaded this protective material with collapsed carts and transported it to the northwest area. If the situation is critical, it should be used to block traffic at any time.

Traffic

The north of Shanghai was disturbed all day yesterday. Pedestrians on the roads were like shuttles, but the order was not chaotic. It was indeed the detectives who did their best to maintain it, and fortunately the trams were not obstructed. However, after 7:00 p.m., the No. 6 and Yuan Road trams going north only went to the First Special Court on North Zhejiang Road, and then had to turn around. All the sections of North Station and Shenjiahong were temporarily suspended. The No. 5 and 7 trams also changed to turning around in front of the court on North Zhejiang Road after 7:00 p.m. Therefore, the traffic between various places and the North Station at night was completely cut off, which was very inconvenient for those who wanted to go to the North Station area.

### French Concession Strictly Maintains Law and Order

The French Concession authorities, in order to maintain the peace of mind of the expatriates and Chinese residents, merchants, etc. in the concession, have installed iron gates at the junction of the Chinese and French sides on the south side. Recently, a solid wall is being built along Xujiahui Road from Xieqiao to the banks of the Rihui Port, hiring workers to build a solid wall for protection. In addition, due to the recent extreme tension in the situation, residents from the Chinese territories in the north and south cities have moved to the concession one after another, fearing that there may be deficiencies in the defense in the event of an accident. Therefore, the French Public Works Bureau has spent money to purchase a large number of wood and barbed wire materials, hired workers to make barbed wire frames, and piled them up in the open space in front of and behind various police stations, in order to be placed at the various important passes along the border of the concession in case of emergency to protect the peace of mind in the concession.

### The "Do Not Buy and Sell Smuggled Goods" Association Actively Promotes Association Affairs

Sends Letters to Various Organizations to Raise Funds

The "Do Not Buy and Sell Smuggled Goods" Movement Committee, in order to arouse all sectors of society not to buy or sell smuggled goods in times of emergency, prevent the invasion of violent enemies, and harm the national economy, has been actively promoting association affairs and sparing no effort. It has been learned that the administrative expenses of the association are now being informed by the letters to various trade associations, and various organizations and institutions are separately responsible. The official letter said, "Respectfully, all sectors of the city are heartbroken by the rampant smuggling, which endangers the national economy. Therefore, on May 24, a joint meeting was held to announce the establishment of this association and to elect Wang Xiaolai and others to be responsible for carrying out association affairs. In the past two months, the handling of propaganda and swearing-in work has aroused the deep attention of the Chinese people. Now, the violent enemy is invading, and the more intense. The affairs of this association should continue to be promoted, but the administrative expenses are urgently needed to be raised. Therefore, it was decided by the entire committee of this association to send a letter to various organizations in this city, each responsible for 10 to 50 yuan, in order to contribute to it. The records are kept in the volume, and we have always admired your association for your enthusiasm for patriotism, and you have a long-standing sympathy for stopping smuggled goods. Therefore, we have specially recorded the case and sent it to you. We respectfully ask you to take on the responsibility, so as to facilitate the progress of association affairs."

### Problem of Attorney's Application Fees

The Shanghai Bar Association, because the Shanghai Two Special Zone Courts have been charging attorneys for application fees, while the Shanghai District Court is still charging them, feels very ambiguous. In addition to requesting that the fee be waived, it has now received the instruction from the court, saying, "The case was previously reported by the association, requesting that the application fee for engaging attorneys be waived. At that time, the court forwarded it to the Jiangsu High Court for verification and instructions. Now, it is opened in the instruction No. 1049 of the Jiangsu High Court: 'Reported, checked the instruction No. 455 of the Judicial Yuan, and sent the ministry order to the court. It has already stated the current handling situation, and please check and instruct to follow. Before the Ministry's reply, all litigation costs charged shall still be handled as before. You should know this order.' etc., so you should know this order."

### Another Typhoon Will Hit Jiangsu and Zhejiang

Another typhoon that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, its wind force is no less than the one that hit Shanghai a few days ago. The typhoon has blown over Taiwan. According to the report of the Municipal Observatory at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the typhoon has blown over 25 degrees north latitude and 116 degrees east longitude. The wind direction is northwest and the wind force is 60 knots. If the wind direction does not change, the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are at risk of suffering this typhoon disaster.

### Robbery at Zhu Guanghan's Home

Zhu Guanghan, a wealthy gentry from Songjiang living in Shanghai at No. 4 Fenyangfang, at the intersection of Shengmuyuan and Aidaoya Road in the French Concession, was suddenly visited by five robbers at 1:10 p.m. yesterday. Two robbers held guns and guarded the front and back doors, while three robbers rushed in with weapons, locked Zhu's family servant in a room, and threatened them to make no noise. They went upstairs to search and rob. When the robbers entered the door, Zhu's maid found out and sneaked out to report to the French police station. The police station sent Chinese and Western detectives in a police car to pursue and arrest them. The robbers had noticed it and had already fled far away. The loss of Zhu's family at that time is still to be checked and reported. It is said that Zhu was involved in a case a few years ago for a long time, and he hired lawyer Xu Wufang to appeal to the Supreme Court, which was overturned this spring. But misfortunes never come singly. One wave has just subsided, and another wave rises. He was robbed today, which is really unfortunate.

### Suspect in Kidnapping Case Attempts Suicide But Fails

Head Injured Sent to Hospital for Treatment

Shang Wu, the chief detective of the Huishi Police Station, and Wang Youshan, the detective, arrested a suspect named Lu Zude from Nanjing on Tiantong Road the day before yesterday afternoon. Then, he went to No. 109 Fengle Lane, Baolean Road, with the detectives of the police station, and continued to arrest two accomplices, Zhuang A'er from Suzhou and a woman named Sun Xiaomei. Ten pawn tickets were seized and brought back to the police station. It was found that the suspects were suspected of being involved in kidnapping and robbery cases in the concession, and they were ordered to be detained separately. Unexpectedly, this morning, the suspect Chen Zude suddenly bumped his head on the iron bar in the police station detention center, intending to commit suicide. The patrol police in the detention center found out and tried their best to stop him, but his head was already bleeding. Then, at about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yuetang, the lawyer of the police station, stated that the three suspects were related to the kidnapping case and requested that they be detained to continue the investigation. And Chen Zude, because he tried to commit suicide and was injured in the head, should be sent to the hospital. After Judge Fu Lin briefly interrogated Chen and other three people, he ordered that they be detained for seven days for further investigation.

### Two Gun Cases, Robbers Sentenced Separately

One Robber Sentenced to Six Years, Two Robbers Sentenced to Five Years Each

The homes of Wang Yunhai at 30 East Broadway Road and Fan Chenshi at 357 Zhaofeng Road were invaded by a large group of robbers between 1:40 AM on July 26th and 3:30 AM on August 1st. The robbers brandished pistols to silence any protests, seizing clothing, jewelry, and cash worth 610 yuan before fleeing. Detectives Xu Decheng and Shen Binkui of the Huishan Police Station apprehended the suspects, Ningbo natives Wu Shijin, Jin Binghua, and Jin Muyan, at 310 Tangshan Road and handed them over to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the ringleader, A Mao, and other accomplices could not be apprehended and were released. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie Fen presided over the Third Criminal Court, examined the three defendants, and sentenced Wu Shijin to six years in prison, and Jin Binghua and Jin Muyan to five years each.

### Xietu Road Bloodshed

Quarrel Led to Three Stabbed

Qi Lao Er, a native of Gaoyou residing on Xietu Road in the southern triangle of Xujiahui in western Shanghai, worked as a small carpenter. His younger brother, Lao San, was a gangster type. The two brothers were known for their ferocity. This incident stemmed from Zhang Hongyuan, a tailor from Changshu residing at 3161 Xietu Road, who had borrowed one yuan from Qi's mother, agreeing to pay four jiao in monthly interest. He had paid one month's interest, but due to the current situation and slow business, Qi's mother feared Zhang would move, so she repeatedly demanded repayment, even trying to take his clothes. This led to a dispute, during which Qi Lao San grabbed Zhang and beat him severely, causing injuries. Afterwards, the neighbor, Gu Longqing, owner of the Changle Tea Garden, mediated and paid off Zhang's debt on his behalf, urging Qi to apologize to Zhang to resolve the matter. However, Qi refused, and the matter was left unresolved. Last night at 8 PM, the Qi brothers, armed with sharp blades, went to Gu's residence to cause trouble. After a brief argument, they brandished their blades and stabbed wildly, wounding Gu's right arm and ribs in six places. Gu Jin Gen was stabbed three times in the buttocks, and Gu Bingfu was stabbed four times in the abdomen, injuring his internal organs and endangering his life. Upon hearing the commotion, Police Chief Chen Guangrun of the local police station immediately led officers to the scene, where they saw the two murderers covered in blood, running towards them and shouting for help. They were immediately arrested and taken to the station, while the injured were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Gu Bingfu's condition was so severe that he was transferred to Zhongshan Hospital for further treatment, while the other two were treated and released. The two murderers were handed over to the court today for interrogation.

Commentary

### Why Not Stand Firm!

— Shan

The atmosphere in Shanghai suddenly became tense due to the arrival of a large number of Japanese warships. Refugees, young and old, who had been fleeing their homes, had begun to settle down somewhat in recent days. Although there was some disturbance on the night of the Hongqiao Airport incident, the decision to resolve the matter through diplomatic channels the next day turned it into a false alarm. Now, however, with the arrival of a large number of Japanese warships, the Japanese attitude has suddenly become stubborn. Consequently, Shanghai residents who had suffered in the January 28th Incident are once again fleeing their homes in a hurried and chaotic manner.

I am not opposed to moving, especially for residents in the Hongkou area, which is currently within the range of Japanese military force. Their relocation is even more understandable because even if they want to do some work to save the nation, they must "keep the green hills" to "not fear running out of firewood." Based on the "January 28th Incident" and the experience of Tianjin, we can imagine the treatment our compatriots will face if Shanghai unfortunately falls into war under Japanese military power!

However, after moving, what will we do? Cry in despair at home? And is moving from Zhabei and Hongkou to the concessions a move to a "safe zone"?

Let's tentatively acknowledge that the central area of the Public Concession and the French Concession are "safe zones." But how should this "safety" be interpreted? If Shanghai's second January 28th Incident does not occur, then naturally, Zhabei will be as "safe" as the concessions. If it does occur, Zhabei may once again become a battlefield. However, on the battlefield, not everyone will necessarily die. If we win, that area will be safer than the concessions. If we are unlucky, then the concessions may not necessarily be a paradise. Not to mention the humiliation and slaughter that the Japanese will inflict on our compatriots, even if we retreat to the "safe zones," I ask: how many months of food and lodging have you prepared? Without food or clothing, can you stay in the so-called "safe zone"?

There is only one path ahead of us: to survive, we must fight to live! Even a dog will jump over a wall when cornered. We are being driven from east to west, are we to be forced to die obediently before the enemy? With the great river in front and pursuing soldiers behind, we have truly reached such a point. If we don't turn around and fight the enemy, we will have to jump into the great river. And you, are you truly so useless that you are willing to jump into the great river?

We have no way to retreat! If we want to live, we must turn around, stand firm, and fight our enemy. Otherwise, you will not survive.

Everyone has already moved out of Zhabei, yes, that is to avoid unnecessary sacrifice. But what are you preparing to do after moving out?

The situation has reached this point, why not stand firm, why not turn around and prepare to fight the enemy? Where do you want to escape to?

We have nowhere to escape, why not stand firm! Reportage Literature Workshop, Zhi Fu

### Factory Street

— Zhi Fu

We have been running around for three or four days, spreading the word in seven or eight areas, from the beginning until now. To make up for all the shortcomings of the past few days, four enthusiastic young people, still holding onto their iron-willed determination, held a simple discussion again early in the morning of the fifth day as they were about to depart.

We needed to immediately decide where to go today within half an hour: eastward or westward.

But at the meeting, everyone was furrowing their brows and hesitating, silent. After about five minutes of delay, our stubborn and headstrong companion, Shi Min, suddenly stood up and said loudly:

"We should go to the workers' area now! We must do our best to connect every worker's heart and turn them into a strong iron chain!"

That's right. Workers are the most important part of the broad masses in the rear, and we certainly can't forget them! Therefore, his proposal was immediately approved by us. Especially me, to support his proposal, I couldn't help but raise my right arm:

"—Let's adopt this method!"

—However, which area should we go to?… This unresolved question mark hovered anxiously in my heart. Fortunately, another of our companions was quite familiar with the situation in the western district. So, the final destination for today was decided: a factory street on ×× Road (Note). Thus, all eight of our legs began to excitedly alternate, moving forward.

Along the way, the rising sun, like a giant mirror, peeked out from the clouds with golden rays, illuminating us with the same enthusiasm as the sun, accelerating our pace as we walked the road ahead.

However, our faces were serious!…

When we arrived at Factory Street, it was already about 10:15 AM. We chose a spacious corridor nearby. Then, someone in the team skillfully put a roll of newspaper in his hand, marked with the red headline "Baoding Bombed by Japanese Planes", to his mouth as a megaphone. Our loud voice immediately spread in all directions:—

"Brothers! Fellow workers, sisters!..."

—Ah! Ah…

Just as we shouted the first word, a sound of "Ah, ah..." came from every workshop nearby! This sound was simply an excited call, a slave's cry. Immediately, groups of young male and female workers surged like a tide, surrounding us. —They may have been awakened from their dreams; I saw some of them with their hair disheveled or still fastening incomplete buttons…

The noise subsided, and many heads seemed more orderly than before. However, a pale-faced fellow rushed in from the crowd. He raised his bloodless lips and trembled for a while, finally saying tremblingly to us:

"This...this is not allowed to be spoken about here, sir!... Our ×× supervisor just went out... I'm afraid... afraid he'll be back soon. If...if he sees it, things will...will not be a joke!... "

As he spoke, he kept looking around nervously with his sharp eyes. But as he was panicking, some of the male and female workers immediately responded with ferocious smiles:—

"Who's afraid of this ××? You're a traitor, get out of here!"

"Pig! Go away, go lick ××'s ass!"

"Go—get out—"

After everyone drove away the loyal slave, a young woman in her twenties stepped forward and seemed to plead with us:

"Sir! Please speak!—About North China... What are the ×× people doing now...?"

Her sincere expression was like a child who had just learned to walk asking an adult for candy. So, someone eagerly went on to say:

"... Everyone! North China is our Chinese paradise, but now it is being bombarded by the enemy's guns. The two places of Beiping and Tianjin have already fallen. They are mistreating our people everywhere, forcing our Chinese workers to help the ×× army build military defenses... They hit and kill at will. I don't know how many lives have been hurt by them!... Everyone! People's hearts are the same. The enemy is so fierce, can we endure it?—We are going to retaliate now, we are going to..."

### Kick Them Out

— Jiang Mi

"We must drive the enemy back to where they came from!"

"Not afraid of their planes and cannons..."

"…………………"

Suddenly, a chaotic and powerful roar arose diagonally, completely breaking the dull air of the entire factory street! All that was left was the arms and fists of the workers of the ×× factory, waving in the flying dust. …………

We spoke for more than an hour, thoroughly explaining the obligations that the workers should bear now, and the spirit of unity that is needed. Finally, we moved again to another factory street to continue our unfinished work.

However, the pale-faced guy had not even seen a shadow at this time: He probably understood:—He is also a Chinese after all!

(Note) The large dormitories where factory workers live are collectively referred to as "Factory Street".

### What is Hoped for from National Salvation Leaders

—A Voice

Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the national salvation movement in Shanghai has reached an unprecedented climax. Every day we read the news in Shanghai, and no newspaper fails to devote the largest space to news about the national salvation movement. This is naturally worthy of joy and excitement. But I still have some opinions on the current methods and work of the national salvation movement, and I would like to offer them to the reference of the national salvation activists in Shanghai.

First, today's national salvation movement is clearly too top-heavy. We don't say anything else, just look at the list of directors of various organizations. These are the same people in this organization, and they are still the same people in that organization. It seems that the so-called national salvation work is just a trick played by these few people, which is a very bad phenomenon. It is a completely wrong estimate to say that this phenomenon is a trick played by a few people. Our estimate is: yes, the masses do have very high and very real demands for national salvation, but among the people who have been organized, they cannot produce people who can stand alone for a while, so they have to ask the people who are well-known in the society and have more strength to take on the leadership work. But on the other hand, if these same people are directors in every organization, then the work of every organization cannot be done. It makes every organization a hollow organization. This is extremely dangerous, because if this continues, the organization will disappear without being eliminated.

Second, the members or units in today's various national salvation associations or anti-enemy support associations are too rich in the nature of "guilds." Participation in national salvation work is limited to the principals or responsible persons of various public associations and legal entities, and the members and members of various legal entities do not have the opportunity to directly participate in activities. This method makes it impossible for the real public opinion to reach the top. Various public associations and legal entities only increase the burden on members when executing orders from higher authorities, so that members do not feel an active interest in national salvation work and automatically do the work they are willing to do. Objectively, it may instead depress the morale of the people.

Third, contrary to the above two situations, not enough attention is paid to the organization of the lower-level masses. Some people advocate influencing the lower levels through the upper levels, which is also correct: so I don't say that the work of the upper levels is not desirable, but the work of the upper levels without the foundation of the lower levels will not only not be lasting and stable, but also easily make mistakes. For example, as far as Shanghai is concerned, in this national salvation movement, what arrangements and plans have we made for the workers who work in the enemy's factories? Chinese history is really full of valuable lessons. During the May 30th Movement, several of our patriotic compatriots were killed on Nanjing Road, and several national general strikes came immediately, especially the Guangzhou-Hong Kong strike. The strict organization and the persistence of the struggle made Hong Kong suddenly become a declining commercial port. Now the enemy has killed tens of thousands of our compatriots, taken away our land in several provinces, and even Tianjin and Beijing have been lost. Why don't we accept this valuable lesson of history and expand our economic war? The workers of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong strike were all formed into inspection teams. Why don't we need these workers to arm themselves to defend our motherland now?

Naturally, the above points are only thought of for a while, and I hope that those who are concerned about national salvation work will pay attention to them. If you think it is right, you may wish to use it as a reference! If you think it is wrong, then it is also a point of view of one person among the 400 million people. In a word, we must thoroughly democratize the national salvation movement.

### Defending the Lugou Bridge (5)

— By Chen He

Then Mr. Wang explained the importance of the Lugou Bridge to them, "I'm telling you, if our Lugou Bridge is taken by the Japanese devils, then Beiping will be finished immediately. The Lugou Bridge is just like Beiping's throat. If a person's throat is strangled, can he still live? If the Lugou Bridge falls into the hands of the Japanese devils, they can connect with Fengtai at any time and surround Beiping at any time. They can cut off the Pinghan Railway and also advance troops to Niangziguan. In that case, our entire China will be ruined."

(At this moment, the sounds of gunfire and artillery never ceased.)

Li Wu couldn't help but sigh, "With such heavy artillery, whoever gets hit is finished! We were really too polite in the past."

The one-legged hero still bravely said, "It's different now. Our 29th Army won't let them be so rampant. Wherever they go, our troops will follow. No matter how rampant the Japanese devils are, we'll give them a taste of our broadswords."

Nearby farmers all gathered around. One asked worriedly, "Doesn't that mean there will be another war?"

"There's no other way. It's not that we want to fight, it's that the Japanese devils are forcing us to." These were Mr. Wang's words.

Liu Debiao also patted his broken thigh and said, "Let's do it! What's there to be afraid of? Let's first beat the Japanese devils into a complete mess!"
