### Japanese Side Expresses Views on Wang Chonghui's Speech

Acknowledges that the Aim of Foreign Minister Wang's Statement Aligns with Sato's Clarification, but the North China Problem Seems Difficult to Resolve Immediately

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui of China has made a statement on foreign policy that is extremely abstract, its content merely expressing fundamental principles of diplomacy such as mutual benefit, equality, and friendship. There has been no indication of specific policies for the future. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also criticizing Minister Wang's statement with extreme caution. The gist of Minister Wang's statement completely coincides with Foreign Minister Sato's clarification in the House of Peers: "Re-examining the policy toward China from an equal standpoint." Japan has no opposition to this principle and is willing to show sympathy, as an East Asian ally, for China's efforts to move toward national construction. However, the problem lies in how China will concretize this abstract principle. When China implements this principle, if the actual situation is not fully recognized from a political standpoint and a solution is studied based on current facts, then the efforts of both countries' authorities to establish Sino-Japanese peace will inevitably lead to opposition and could worsen Sino-Japanese relations more than the current state. In particular, regarding China's expectations of equality and mutual benefit, if they are aimed at gradually abolishing unequal treaties as China's national system becomes more complete, then the Japanese authorities should naturally respond to the negotiations and be prepared to present Japan's demands. However, if China's demands, as some people advocate, are to abolish the North China policy and other unrealistic and uninformed hard-line demands, then Foreign Minister Sato's efforts to bring the relations between the two countries back to normalcy will inevitably vanish and lose their effectiveness. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes that China will fully understand Foreign Minister Sato's true intentions, implement its foreign policy from a broad perspective, and not misjudge its progress or retreat.

[Tokyo] When Foreign Minister Sato gave a speech on foreign policy in the House of Peers, the newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui also issued a statement on foreign policy in Nanjing. However, Minister Wang's statement was more abstract and simpler than Foreign Minister Sato's detailed reply, which gave the Japanese people an unexpected feeling. Minister Wang's statement was indeed aimed at Japan and can be interpreted as a response to Foreign Minister Hayashi Senjuro's diplomatic speech and Foreign Minister Sato's statement after assuming office. Combining the opinions of various aspects in Japan, Minister Wang first advocated the integration of national sentiments between the two countries, and secondly, he emphasized resolving diplomatic issues based on respect for sovereignty, equality, and mutual benefit. These are, of course, diplomatic remarks, and their spirit is also in line with Foreign Minister Sato's diplomatic speech on the 8th. The key lies in how honestly and realistically the two parties will implement their policies when handling specific issues in the future. In short, the new foreign ministers of China and Japan simultaneously issued statements with the same spirit, advocating mutual cooperation and efforts to stabilize East Asia. Therefore, it is naturally the responsibility of the authorities of both countries to discover methods of economic and political cooperation within this atmosphere. However, concerning the preservation of territorial integrity, if the Chinese side immediately demands the dissolution of the Eastern Hebei and Chahar governments according to their ideals, or adopts an attitude of denying the special nature of the "Manchukuo"-China-Japan contiguous region, then no matter how skillfully the foreign ministers of the two countries speak, it will ultimately amount to nothing more than words. Therefore, it is anticipated that Minister Wang will not adhere to this kind of abstract idealism in the future but will be able to see the big picture clearly and strive to implement practical policies.

[Tokyo] This morning, all newspapers here published the talk given by our new Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui to foreign journalists in the most important position. The Asahi Shimbun commented in its news column that Wang Chonghui's talk was directed at the speech given by Hayashi Senjuro in the Diet and Sato Naotake's remarks after taking office as Foreign Minister, considering this an important stance towards Japan. The Chinese Foreign Minister is preparing to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, which indeed contains important significance. Sato announced the same attitude in the House of Peers, and Wang made his statement only a few hours later. Although Wang's wording is abstract, a new path and agreement have already been discovered in the diplomatic stance of the two countries. Now that the two gentlemen have assumed the positions of foreign ministers in both countries and mutually acknowledge each other's positions, a new situation is developing and the stabilization of East Asia can be jointly achieved. The newspaper reveals the attitude of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, believing that under the current atmosphere, it is natural to seek various concrete plans for economic and political cooperation. However, regarding the point of maintaining territorial sovereignty, if China insists on abolishing the puppet organization of Eastern Hebei, Japan will still have to take decisive measures. Therefore, if China fully understands Japan's true intentions, it must deal with the situation skillfully, it is said. (Ninth Day, Central News Agency Telegraph)

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato Naotake's speech in the House of Peers yesterday, although there was no original manuscript, seems to have obtained the consent of Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro, Army Minister Sugiyama Gen, and Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa. Ohkouchi's questions also seem to have been agreed upon in advance, providing Sato with the opportunity to give the speech. According to what is known here, the reactions from various countries have been excellent. The Soviet Union believes that it is a new measure by Japan towards China. However, judging from the psychology of authoritative figures here, although there is no objection to Sato's abstract talk on clarifying principles, regarding specific issues, such as abolishing the puppet organization of Eastern Hebei and returning the six counties of northern Chahar, not only have opinions against this been discovered, but some have even expressed strong opinions. Therefore, many existing difficulties cannot be resolved by merely discussing principles. Sato's plan for resolving specific problems is currently unknown, but if China's position is not given appropriate respect and Sato cannot find a way to resolve it reasonably, then the discussion of principles may ultimately become empty talk. However, the atmosphere here has greatly changed, and all those concerned about Sino-Japanese issues are eagerly awaiting Sato to put his words into action and restore Sino-Japanese relations to a normal path.

### 230,000 English Tons of Lu Salt to be Exported to Japan

Contract Agreement to be Signed on the 11th; Japanese Occupation of Tanggu Salt Flats Withdrawn

[Tianjin] The eastern and western Tanggu salt flats, previously occupied by the Japanese military as salt production land, have had their barbed wire fences removed and been restored to their original condition through ongoing negotiations between the Standing Bureau [of the Tianjin Municipal Government] and the Japanese. (9th Special Dispatch)

[Tianjin] An agreement on the export of Lu salt to Japan has been reached, and the signing is scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 11th at the Lu Salt Transport Office. The Hebei-Chahar Economic Council will send Commissioner Li Lulu to participate. The Chinese representatives for the signing will be Lu Salt Transport Commissioner Li Hanhua, Lu Feng Store Manager Shao Jingyin, and Salt Farm Representative Shao Ziqin. The Japanese representative will be Seino Tsunetaro, the Minister of Xingzhong Salt Industry. The total export volume is 230,000 English tons, with a price of 2.4 yuan per ton. The prices and procedures are the same as last year, except that Xingzhong will additionally provide a subsidy of 20,000 yuan to 90 salt farm households to avoid severe losses. Xingzhong plans to establish the Tanggu Transportation Company next month, after which transportation will begin, loading onto giant ships outside Dagu Port for shipment to Hokkaido to supply the Tokugawa Soda Company and Asahi Glass Company for the production of chemical salt. Xingzhong is still planning other methods regarding occupying Lu salt permanent benefits. (9th Special Dispatch)

[Tianjin] The Japanese side has designated ten giant ships from the Dai Nippon Steamship Company and International Transportation Company for the Lu salt export transportation, divided into one or two batches of 100,000 tons each, and a third batch of 30,000 tons, to be transported to China in about four months. Li Hanhua returned to Tianjin from Peiping on the 9th to preside over the contract signing on the 11th. According to a salt farm owner in Changlu, the price of Lu salt is 2.4 yuan per ton, resulting in unbearable losses for the salt farm households. Only because Xingzhong took over the overseas export matters and did not want the mountain price to be higher than last year, did Li Sihao negotiate a subsidy of 20,000 yuan, which is not included in the contract. Salt farm households are requesting that the price be allowed to increase during the next salt purchase, but the Japanese side is unwilling. Of the more than 200 salt farm households in northern Changlu, over 100 have gone bankrupt due to losses over the years. There are currently 90 cases. The Japanese purchase of so much salt has created a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Various defunct salt farm households are applying to the Hebei Provincial Government for loans of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to prepare for resumption of work, and are currently in consultation. Shao Jingyin, manager of the Lu Feng Store, stated that Lu salt has always used metric tons, each ton being 32 jin less than an English ton. The Japanese side insisted on using English tons for the salt they purchased, resulting in an invisible loss of approximately 32 jin per ton for the salt farm households. This point was negotiated several times without success, and the salt farm households had no choice but to sell at a loss. (9th Special Dispatch)

Current Commentary

### An Analysis of Sato's Diplomacy

— Fu

Since the peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident, Japan's perception of China has undergone considerable change. For example, Suma, the former Japanese Consul-General in Nanking, recently returned to Japan and praised our country's strength, saying that it was like the rising sun. Kodama, the leader of the Japanese observation group soon to visit China, also emphasized the need to look at China with new eyes. The diplomatic speech made by Sato, the new Japanese Foreign Minister, in the Diet on the 7th, was even rarer than anything since the September 18th Incident. In his speech, Sato stated that the diplomacy of a country should have continuity, but that anything unsuitable for the current situation should be changed. In Sato's view, Japan's previous diplomacy towards China did have aspects that could not adapt to the new developments, so he said, "The Sino-Japanese problem can only be solved if we change our methods and start anew." What is the new starting point that Sato mentioned? The main thing is to treat China as an equal and conduct negotiations. Sato said, "Negotiations between fully independent countries should be based on equal status." He also said, "We should let everything in the past flow away and conduct negotiations anew on an equal footing." The speech by Foreign Minister Sato is indeed one that has not been heard since [the September 18th Incident] and is worth paying close attention to.

However, after listening to the speech by the new Japanese Foreign Minister, we must point out that what Sato is asking to be changed is the method of Japan's negotiations with China, not the fundamental policy of Japan's diplomacy towards China. The fundamental policy of Japan's diplomacy towards China is the vigorous implementation of the continental policy. This continental policy will not be changed or abandoned unless it faces extreme obstacles. What Sato said about "a country's diplomacy should have continuity" refers to this point. Therefore, what the new Foreign Minister Sato advocates changing is the method of negotiating with China. This change in negotiating methods may solve some problems between the two countries, but the goals they seek to achieve are no different. This is what we should understand.

Why does Foreign Minister Sato advocate changing the attitude towards China? There are two important reasons. The first is that China's unification is becoming increasingly consolidated. All parties and factions are united under the grand goal of resisting foreign aggression by the central government, forming a huge force that makes it impossible for Japan to take whatever it wants as before. In particular, the peaceful resolution of the Two Guangxi Incident and the Xi'an Incident last year made it impossible for Japan to treat our country as a "non-modern country." Furthermore, the victory of the Suiyuan Resistance and the stalemate in the Sino-Japanese negotiations in Nanking made it impossible for Japan not to consider changing its past policies. The second is that the result of Japan's vigorous implementation of the continental policy in recent years has provoked serious international repercussions and has led to a position of international isolation. The conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany last year was intended to break this isolation, but the result was the opposite. Not only are all countries around the world paying attention to this agreement, but the people of Japan are also extremely dissatisfied, rising up to attack the government. In such a situation of international isolation, the Japanese government has no choice but to change its past attitude towards China. Because, as the new Foreign Minister said, "The fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese problem is the key to Japan's future diplomacy. The success or failure of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations will not only have a serious impact on Japan's relations with the Soviet Union but is also related to Britain and the United States. As for the so-called Pacific problem and disarmament problem, they are inseparable from the China problem. If the Sino-Japanese problem can be adjusted, then the friction between Japan and other powers can be greatly reduced. At the same time, Japan's credibility can also be improved." (See Sato's interview with reporters on the 7th)

Of the two reasons mentioned above, the former is more important than the latter. Because the consolidation of our country's unification enables us to adopt a strong policy of maintaining sovereignty and integrity against Japan, Japan will not make excessive demands, and the continental policy will not be successfully implemented. Therefore, the conflict between Japan and various countries over interests in the Far East will not be so serious. So, if we want to hope that Japan can change its past attitude towards China, then we must first support the central government, consolidate the unification, and adopt a strong policy that an independent country should have towards the outside world. If we do not do this and harbor extravagant hopes for Sato's diplomacy, we will be deceived. Because if they really have the determination to change their diplomacy towards China and treat us as an equal country, then they should respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, first abolish the illegal organizations in North China, and return the four northeastern provinces. Then come and negotiate the adjustment of diplomatic relations, economic cooperation, and a method of "coexistence and co-prosperity."

### Guo Taiqi Expresses Satisfaction with Sato's Diplomatic Declaration

Says the Stalemate in Sino-Japanese Negotiations Must be Broken; Anglo-Japanese Compromise Should Respect Chinese Interests

[London]

Reuters' representative today visited the Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. Ambassador Guo expressed satisfaction with the speech given by the new Japanese Foreign Minister Sato in the House of Peers, in which he sympathized with China's desire for equality with other countries. He also stated that the stalemate in Sino-Japanese negotiations must be broken, but negotiations should be restarted based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. He said, "I feel that Sato's friendly gesture will surely elicit a normal response from Nanking. The appointment of Dr. Wang Chonghui as China's Foreign Minister and Sato's appointment as Japan's Foreign Minister were announced on the same day, which may be a good omen, as this may allow both sides to make a new start on new ideas regarding their mutual relationship. The result of Sato's speech may be beneficial to all countries that are concerned with peace and commerce in the Far East. China's efforts to be friendly with the powers are tireless, and it pays particular attention to its neighbors. It is proceeding with this on the basis of equality and reciprocity, so it will welcome any proposal for a friendly solution." Ambassador Guo continued to mention that the Japanese Foreign Minister is willing to rebuild friendship with Britain and eliminate the source of conflict in the Chinese market, saying that he is confident that China can only express satisfaction with this development. As for any compromise between Britain and Japan, it goes without saying that it will respect China's economic and political interests. Ambassador Guo finally stated that everything he said was his personal opinion. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 8th)

### British Goodwill

[London] The speech given yesterday by the new Japanese Foreign Minister Sato in the House of Peers has elicited a good impression here and in various circles related to the Far East, as well as in other circles. Generally, people believe that the Japanese government is now fully aware of the failure of its current policy towards China and will inevitably change its strategy sooner or later. Japan now seems willing to respect China's proposal to take the principle of equality as the basis for new negotiations to resolve the outstanding issues between China and Japan. It is also said that previous Japanese foreign ministers have often given similarly exciting speeches when taking office, but based on current phenomena, it is believed that this speech by Sato must have the full support of Prime Minister Hayashi and Army Minister Sugiyama. The political atmosphere in Tokyo seems to be firmly of the same opinion regarding Sato's ability to fulfill what he said. Furthermore, the new Foreign Minister seems to have the sympathy of the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe. Ambassador Kawagoe once spoke out in favor of reorganizing Japan's policy towards China, and representatives of non-official influential circles related to Sino-Japanese economic relations have also expressed the same opinion. The British are deeply impressed by the friendly diplomacy used by the British to establish harmonious cooperation between China and Britain in South China in recent months. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 9th)

### American Reservation

[Washington] After the new Japanese Foreign Minister Sato issued a declaration on foreign policy, American political figures have adopted a reserved attitude towards it. They said that the American government supports Foreign Minister Sato's proposal to improve relations between China and Japan, but it is feared that the true intention of Japan's change of attitude is to consolidate the understanding between Japan and Germany. Its main purpose seems to be to eliminate the danger of war between Japan and China, and to keep China neutral in any future war between Japan and Russia. This is what American diplomatic circles have said, that the Chinese government is currently planning to create national unity in order to resist Japan's threat, so Japan is taking the opportunity to propose the conclusion of a new treaty of friendship with China, so that China will not be influenced by Moscow. (Central News Agency, Havas, 8th)

### Dongbao Commentary

[Tokyo] After Foreign Minister Sato gave a speech on foreign policy in the House of Peers yesterday, only three newspapers, the Asahi Shimbun, the Yomiuri Shimbun, and the Miyako Shimbun, commented on it this morning. Regarding the point about diplomacy towards China, the Jiji Shimbun stated that, in principle, Foreign Minister Sato's view on diplomacy towards China should not be opposed. Sato has asserted that Japan's diplomacy towards China in the past few years has been a complete failure. Such a definite statement from the mouth of a diplomatic authority can be said to be a rare and frank confession. Unfortunately, this assertion should not only not be denied, but from our point of view, there is also a question: That is, has Japan ever had thorough diplomacy towards China in the past few years? The main reason for the current stalemate is that Japan has insisted on its own narrow point of view in its diplomacy towards China from beginning to end, and has neglected the need to observe the overall situation from the perspective of international relations. We have repeatedly stated that the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is the cornerstone of Japan's entire foreign policy, and therefore it cannot be expected to succeed without cooperation with various countries concerned about China. Sato is a person who is most suitable for the work of re-examining the Sino-Japanese issue from a new starting point, as he has valuable experience in international diplomacy. The Yomiuri Shimbun commented that Foreign Minister Sato's remarks about starting anew, changing the way of thinking, and letting everything in the past flow away in preparation for resuming negotiations on an equal footing, should be regarded as a further step forward compared to what Prime Minister Hayashi said in the Diet before, that the people of the two countries should have contact with each other from time to time in order to substantially increase the approach and mutual assistance between China and Japan. It is unexpected that the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui also declared to reporters on the same day that international relations should be based on equality and mutual benefit, and that efforts should be made to increase friendship through peaceful means. These words are truly a good contrast. The simultaneous re-pointing out and re-declaration of the assertion of increasing friendship under the principle of equality and mutual benefit by the two foreign ministers of China and Japan made people feel refreshed, as if breathing fresh air. However, this alone should not be regarded as a sufficient guarantee to judge that the Sino-Japanese negotiations, which have encountered countless setbacks, can proceed smoothly. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the authorities of both countries will not ignore the true situation of the current situation, otherwise, the good air will unfortunately dissipate like mist.

The Miyako Shimbun reported that Foreign Minister Sato has been stationed abroad for a long time, and for this reason, he feels the need for a continuous sense of diplomacy. Although domestic sentiment is very important in determining the path of diplomacy, the situation of the other party should also be carefully considered. This is especially necessary in relation to China because the situation in China is complex and delicate. As for the opinion of changing the way of thinking from a new starting point, it is what we have always supported. (Central News Agency, 9th)

### The Japanese Parliament Focuses on the House of Peers

Budget Bill Begins Deliberation

[Tokyo] The House of Peers began deliberating on the government budget bill today, shifting the parliamentary focus to the House of Peers. The government is optimistic, as the budget bill passed smoothly through the House of Representatives, and believes that although there may be discussions in the House of Peers, the budget will ultimately be passed. However, with only seventeen days remaining in the parliamentary session, they intend to do their utmost to expedite the House of Peers' deliberation on the budget and, if necessary, implement a minimal extension of the session to ensure the budget bill is successfully enacted. (9th Associated Press Telegram)

[Tokyo] Today's House of Peers meeting commenced at 10:25 AM. With the budget bill transferred from the House of Representatives, the focus temporarily shifted to the House of Peers, creating a tense atmosphere in the chamber. The gallery was also filled to capacity. At the outset, Finance Minister Yuki requested and took the floor to explain the outline of the 12th fiscal year's general budget. His speech was similar to the financial address he gave in the House of Representatives. He stated that this revised budget had been approved by the House of Representatives as originally proposed, but as the budget bill was being submitted later than usual this year, he hoped that it would be reviewed and approved, given the shortened session. His speech lasted for thirty-five minutes. (9th Associated Press Telegram)

[Tokyo] Today, someone in the Japanese House of Peers raised an extremely absurd question that caused amusement. It is incomprehensible that such residual thinking still exists in today's world. An aged Doctor of Literature, Sanzji Mikami, currently a member of the House of Peers, suddenly questioned Foreign Minister Naotake Sato during today's meeting, asking why the Japanese government acknowledges the customary name "Republic of China." Mikami attempted to explain that the habitual use of the two characters "Zhonghua" (中華) implies contempt for countries other than China. Sato replied that the Cabinet meeting of 1930 decided that China should be referred to as "Republic of China" in official documents. Sato also said that each country's name is freely chosen by the country, and other countries cannot but recognize it. Furthermore, the term "Shina" (支那) does not necessarily imply contempt. Mikami then rose again to object to Sato's speech yesterday, saying that the Chinese people are too self-respecting to be treated as equals. (Central News Agency, 9th Telegram)

### Japanese Minister of Commerce Explains Economic Relations with Manchukuo

[Tokyo] Today, in the House of Representatives' Export Guarantee Committee, Minister of Commerce Godo, in response to a question from Ichiro Miyamoto of the Seiyukai, clarified the government's policy on industrial and trade relations between Japan and Manchukuo as follows:

㊀ From Japan's perspective alone, the best approach would be to clearly define the division of industries between Japan and Manchukuo, with Manchukuo producing raw materials and Japan processing them. However, since Manchukuo is a firmly "independent state," it is inevitable that it will gradually develop processing industries, which is the root of Japan's headache. Therefore, for the future, Japan must prevent unfavorable competition and seek to adjust based on the consumption economies of both Japan and Manchukuo. Trade policies must also focus on this. ㊁ From the viewpoint of Japan-Manchukuo trade, the ideal situation would be to integrate the Japan-Manchukuo economic bloc and abolish tariffs. However, a special preferential tariff treaty between Japan and Manchukuo should not be easily implemented and should be carefully considered. ㊂ In the future, the Manchukuo market cannot be considered immune to competition between Japan and China. However, considering the special circumstances between Japan and Manchukuo, there is no reason for anything particularly unfavorable to Japan, as Manchukuo's new industries are all established with Japanese capital. ㊃ To prevent economic competition between Japan and China in Manchukuo, it would be inappropriate to establish a special agreement between Japan and Manchukuo. In reality, Manchukuo's industrial plans and funds are all created by Japan. If such Manchukuo were threatened by China, it would be a great disgrace to our national industry. Furthermore, I believe it is unacceptable to attempt to expel Chinese economic power from Manchukuo. (9th Kokumin Telegram)

### League of Nations Raw Materials Conference: British Representative States Opinions

Opposes Open Door Policy in Colonies, Prepares to Encourage Raw Material Production, Japanese Representative Advocates Freedom of Immigration

[Geneva] The League of Nations recently convened a conference to study the issue of equal commercial opportunities for all countries regarding certain raw materials. Sixteen countries participated, including Japan, although it is not a member of the League of Nations, while Germany and Italy had no representatives present. The conference opened today with an opening address by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, who stated that the participants do not fully represent their national governments and can freely express their opinions. The meeting will be held in private, and only summaries of the proceedings will be published. (Central News Agency, 8th Reuters Telegram)

Subsequently, the representatives of Great Britain and Japan delivered speeches. The British representative, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross (the government's economic advisor who previously came to China to investigate financial and economic conditions), claimed that he was expressing his personal views, but well-informed sources believe that what he presented was, in fact, the British government's perspective. Leith-Ross stated, "If we want to transfer the colonies belonging to various countries in order to solve the difficulty of raw materials, even if all the colonies on the continent are transferred, it may not be effective, and some countries may not be able to be self-sufficient in raw materials. In order to solve the problem of raw materials, the British government is prepared to encourage the production of various raw materials in its colonies. Even if a certain raw material is only needed by foreign countries and is useless to Britain, we should try to increase its output, but apart from this, Britain does not want to do anything more. Furthermore, adopting an open-door policy in the colonies of various countries often hinders the development of colonial enterprises and is detrimental to the welfare of the indigenous people. Many countries, on the one hand, advocate an open-door policy, while on the other hand, adopt completely opposite policies, such as hindering the development of international trade and maintaining currency exchange rates by artificial means. How self-contradictory is this? The reason why many countries lack raw materials is because these countries have implemented inappropriate fiscal and economic policies at home. Among them, the system of limiting import quotas is the most inappropriate. The burden of manufacturing artificial raw materials to replace natural raw materials on the national economy is actually greater than purchasing raw materials from foreign countries. The result of the implementation of such policies only serves to lower the living standards of the people." Leith-Ross also believed that the note drafted by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on the issue of raw materials did not mention the issue of food, which is regrettable, because the problem of food supply is even more important than the problem of industrial production. Leith-Ross further advocated compiling statistics on the production, consumption, and prices of raw materials and establishing a small committee for each raw material, with representatives from the major importing and exporting countries of that raw material serving as members.

The Japanese representative, Shuto, the commercial counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Germany, then delivered a speech, generally advocating the abolition of various restrictions on the export of raw materials. In all undeveloped colonies, freedom of immigration should be universally permitted, and no restrictions should be imposed regardless of the nationality or race of the immigrants. The current system in the Congo of Africa should be followed in all undeveloped colonies. Shuto also said that the two issues of free trade and raw material distribution cannot be separated. As far as Japan is concerned, the supply of raw materials for industrial use is related to Japan's survival and is extremely important, but merely using various methods to facilitate the import of raw materials into Japan is not enough to solve the current difficulties. It is also necessary to take various measures to facilitate international trade in industrial manufactured goods. (Central News Agency, 8th Havas Telegram)

### German Ambassador to Britain Scheduled to Return to Post Today

[Berlin] German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop, who recently returned to Germany to attend the Leipzig City Fair, is now scheduled to return to London this Wednesday.

### Important Speech by British Foreign Secretary Eden

Does Not Believe a Major War is Unavoidable, Praises American Peace Efforts

[London] In a speech delivered at Albetinge last night, Foreign Secretary Eden stated that the large-scale arms buildup by various countries should not lead to the conclusion that a world war is inevitable. The British government will not endorse such a fatalistic doctrine, and those who work for peace are truly numerous and diverse in their methods. Many are aware that once a war breaks out, both the victors and the vanquished will suffer immeasurable disasters that cannot be avoided. This alone is enough to make ambitious individuals cautious and prevent them from acting rashly. Eden continued by saying that the United States is a great protagonist in stabilizing peace. Looking at the current state of turmoil in the world, one thing is comforting: that in the large area where the American flag is displayed, there are those who love peace and strive for progress, engaged in great work.

The Foreign Secretary continued, saying that foreign affairs will be one of the main issues discussed at the upcoming Imperial Conference. The value of a free exchange of views on this issue by the various departments of the British government at this time cannot be overestimated. The British government intends to present all the facts openly and fully at the meeting and will strive to reach a compromise in a direction that contributes to the prosperity of the various departments of the British Empire and world peace. The British government firmly believes that a rearmament program is beneficial to peace and is indisputable. If necessary, it intends to implement it thoroughly, but the British government will seize the first opportunity to curb the evil forces of increased armaments, and will never miss the opportunity to establish international agreements to promote trade and international relations.

### Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War Passes Oversight Plan

Includes Declaration and Attachments, Maritime Surveillance to Begin Saturday

[London] The Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session this afternoon. After a lengthy discussion, the committee finally passed a plan for the surveillance of Spanish land and sea borders. Representatives of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy immediately announced that their respective governments were prepared to implement the maritime surveillance plan starting on the 13th of this month. In addition, the Non-Intervention Committee also passed a proposal by the French representative to include representatives from three other signatory countries to the non-intervention agreement, in addition to the representatives from Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia, in the London headquarters responsible for implementing the surveillance plan. The Non-Intervention Committee then passed a resolution on future work, arguing that: ㊀ the issue of expanding the scope of the Non-Intervention Agreement should be studied. "Expanding" refers to prohibiting not only the direct intervention acts of shipping arms to Spain and sending volunteers to Spain, but also various indirect intervention acts, such as providing financial support to both sides of the civil war and sending individuals of Spanish nationality to Spain to engage in activities that prolong the civil war or increase the conflict. ㊁ various methods should be drafted as soon as possible to ensure that all foreign individuals who directly or indirectly participate in the civil war within Spain are forced to withdraw. Finally, the Non-Intervention Committee resolved the difficulties that arose in Germany regarding surveillance expenses. According to the surveillance budget of £1 million, Germany is responsible for over £140,000, but due to the country's lack of foreign currency, the Non-Intervention Committee agreed to have the country pay £10,000 first, with the remaining amount to be paid in foreign currency, and the payment method will be determined later. (Central News Agency, 8th Havas Telegram)

[London] Regarding the plan for land border surveillance in Spain, the implementation process, as generally understood, will be divided into three steps: ㊀ appointing main supervisors to begin performing their duties; ㊁ appointing lower-level personnel; ㊂ each of these personnel performing their duties. As for the distribution of supervisors, in addition to the 130 British inspectors dispatched along the border between Portugal and Spain, 130 international inspectors will be stationed in the Pyrenees Mountains, i.e., the border between France and Spain, and five will be stationed at the border between the British territory of Gibraltar and Spain. There will also be a total of 550 naval supervisors. Regarding the issue of the Spanish Canary Islands, i.e., the ships of the countries participating in the non-intervention agreement traveling from the Americas to Spain should dock in the ports of the Canary Islands to be inspected, there are currently differences of opinion among the countries concerned, and it will be resolved at a later date. (Central News Agency, 8th Havas Telegram)

[London] The land and sea border surveillance plan passed by the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War yesterday includes a declaration and one attachment each. The declaration states that: ㊀ after the Non-Intervention Committee passed a resolution on the 16th of last month to prohibit volunteers from participating countries from going to Spain, the governments of the member countries have recently decided to expand the scope to include non-Spanish nationals who are recruited or transit in these countries, or who depart from these countries to Spain to aid the civil war, and prohibit them as well. ㊁ The member countries believe that establishing a border inspection system on the Spanish land border to examine the implementation of the Non-Intervention Agreement is beneficial. ㊂ The Portuguese government invited the British government to dispatch inspectors to the border area between Portugal and Spain to inspect the implementation of the agreement, and the British government has accepted this invitation and will treat these inspectors as personnel attached to the British Embassy in Portugal. ㊃ The British government notified the committee that after the above measures were established, the country's inspectors could carry out their duties. ㊄ The member countries firmly believe that the British government, in cooperation with Portugal, will be able to complete its mission, and therefore decided to implement surveillance measures in accordance with the annex in the border area between Spain and France, the border area between Spain and the British territory of Gibraltar, and the Spanish coast and territories, until an amendment or other resolution is passed at a later date. The declaration also stated that the four countries, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, have stated to the committee that they will begin zonal surveillance of Spanish waters on the 13th of this month.

The attachment is divided into seven sections: ㊀ The surveillance measures and the organization of the London headquarters; ㊁ Special surveillance measures for the Spanish land border; ㊂ Surveillance measures for ships belonging to countries participating in the Non-Intervention Agreement traveling to Spain, but surveillance measures for ships belonging to these countries coming from the Americas and required to anchor in the ports of the Canary Islands will be discussed separately; ㊃ The zonal surveillance measures by warships of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy along the coast and territories of mainland Spain. This coastline is approximately 10,000 nautical miles long, and the warships of each country should fly their national flag; ㊄ Inspectors from various countries should implement surveillance measures in a gradual process; ㊅ The total surveillance cost is £834,000, to be amortized over twelve months. Participating countries should allocate funds to the headquarters according to the ratio set by the headquarters. This ratio may be revised to be fair. Of these, the expenses required for the surveillance measures at the border between Portugal and Spain should be borne 80% by the United Kingdom and 20% by Portugal. The expenses required in Spanish waters should be borne by the countries responsible for surveillance, i.e., Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy; ㊆ The date of establishment of the headquarters (i.e., March 8th).

### Portugal Still Has Objections

Obstacles to Surveillance Measures Not Yet Removed

Lisbon: Rumors that the Portuguese government has reached an agreement with the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War, allowing Soviet ships to anchor in Portuguese ports (Portugal originally did not allow Soviet merchant ships to anchor in Lisbon and the Portuguese island of Madeira to implement surveillance measures), were denied in a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Militia Fights Valiantly, Positions Remain Unmoved

Madrid: Our correspondent Rowling reports that the Nationalist forces launched an offensive today in the area of Guadalajara city northeast of the capital, advancing along the highway from Madrid to Aragon province, using tanks and other modern weapons.

### Spanish Government Cargo Ship Sunk

Transferred Cargo Mid-Voyage, Arms Not Lost

[London] The Spanish ship "Mar Cantabrico" (2,518 tons) was bombarded and sunk today by the Nationalist cruiser "Canarias" in the Bay of Biscay. The British Admiralty issued a statement tonight claiming that four British destroyers responded to the ship's SOS signal and sailed to rescue it. The HMS Echo received a telegram from the Canarias stating that the ship's crew had been rescued and boarded the ship, which proves that the ship has indeed sunk. The Nationalist forces were overjoyed at the sinking of the ship, as it was carrying $3.5 million worth of arms for the Spanish government. It quietly sailed out of New York Harbor a few hours before the U.S. Congress passed a law prohibiting the shipment of war materiel to Spain. The U.S. Coast Guard tried to chase it but failed. Since January 1st of this year, the Nationalist forces had vowed to capture it. On January 21st, it was reported that the ship had arrived in Veracruz, but then no trace of it was found. Nationalist warships had been patrolling the coast closely to prevent the unloading of its cargo. It is now believed that the ship had not had time to unload its cargo before it was attacked. (Central News Agency, 8th Reuters Telegram)

[Washington] Sources within the Spanish government said here today that "the arms carried by the cargo ship 'Mar Cantabrico' were not lost. Before the ship set sail from the United States, it was anticipated that the rebel forces would intercept it, so it was planned to transfer the arms to another ship mid-voyage and sail directly to a port under the control of the Spanish government forces. The 'Mar Cantabrico' then continued on its original route to deceive the enemy." (9th Kokumin Telegram)

[London] It is learned that the Spanish ship "Mar Cantabrico," which was sunk yesterday in the Bay of Biscay by a Spanish Nationalist cruiser, was a 6,000-ton vessel that sailed from New York Harbor on January 6th. The ship was carrying a large quantity of war materiel, including eight aircraft and thirty-two field guns, all for the Spanish government. (Central News Agency, 9th Reuters Telegram)

Saint John of Luz: The Spanish government forces learned today of the sinking of the cargo ship "Mar Cantabrico" and were greatly alarmed, as the arms it carried were urgently needed. Madrid originally planned to launch a counter-offensive against the rebel forces as soon as it received these arms, in order to clear the enemy traces in the suburbs of the capital. Now that it has all vanished, this plan will naturally suffer a major setback. It is not known whether Madrid will be able to hold out. (9th Kokumin Telegram)

[New York]

According to Reuters' New York correspondent, although the Spanish merchant ship "Mar Cantabrico" failed to pass through the blockade of the Spanish Nationalist coast, the government forces' embassy in Mexico City still plans to continue shipping arms and food to Spain. The Mexican government is currently cooperating, and the Spanish merchant ship "Motormar" is now loading military supplies, preparing to set sail. (Central News Agency, 9th Reuters Telegram)

### Atrocious Behavior of Italian Troops Stationed in Abyssinia

Part of the Information Verified. Undersecretary of State Answers Member's Question

[London] During today's session of the House of Commons, several members inquired about the events of February 19 in Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, when an assassination attempt was made on Italian Governor-General Graziani. In his response, Undersecretary Cranborne implicitly acknowledged the massacre perpetrated by the Italian authorities after the incident. He stated, "While it is difficult to obtain accurate details, it is generally known that after the incident, Addis Ababa experienced great turmoil. Italian soldiers took the opportunity to engage in severe acts of retaliation, resulting in many Abyssinian deaths and significant property damage. I am pleased to inform you that British citizens and those under British protection who were arrested after the incident have been released after the acting British Consul-General's negotiations with the Italian authorities. No British citizens died in this case." Labor MP Fletcher asked the Undersecretary to note that eyewitnesses claimed the Italian soldiers' retaliatory actions were indescribably barbaric and the most brutal act seen in Africa since the Congo massacre.

### A Certain Military Officer Flies to North Chahar to Inspect Puppet Troops

And Inspects an Armament Factory Established by a Certain Party. Li Shouxin's Force's Equipment Transported Back Outside the Great Wall

Zhangbei Correspondence: After the puppet troops in North Chahar and Jehol, following the orders of a certain military headquarters, withdrew to their original defense positions in Jehol Province before March 1, military actions have temporarily come to an end. It is said that the important task of the puppet troops' withdrawal is to expand training. Recently, in order to understand the actual training situation after the reorganization of the Mongolian puppet troops, a certain military headquarters sent three officers who flew from Changchun to Gongbei on a military plane at 4 PM on the 5th of this month. Kuwahara, the head of the Zhangbei Special Affairs Agency, and Li Shouxin, the puppet deputy commander, who had originally gone to the Xiqide Wang Mansion to offer condolences on the 4th of this month, rushed to Zhangbei by car at noon on the 5th after receiving the news and went to the airport outside the East Gate to welcome them. After the officers got off the plane, they went to the Special Affairs Agency in the city to rest. Then, accompanied by Kuwahara and Li Shouxin, they inspected the armament factory established by a certain party inside the East Gate. It is said that the officers will inspect each of the puppet troops separately starting from the 6th and will stay for several days before returning.

The mother of De Wang was buried on the 5th. Many people from all sides went to the West Sunite Banner to offer condolences. De Wang usually served his mother with filial piety and was known for it. He was overwhelmed with grief and became ill. According to De Wang's original intention, he planned to stay in the West Banner to guard his mother's tomb and recuperate, but because a certain party urged him so urgently that it could not be delayed, De Wang sent a telegram to the Jia Bu Temple puppet government on the evening of the 5th, saying that he had decided to return to the temple in the next few days.

Six tanks and ten airplanes, which a certain party had previously issued to Li Shouxin's force, were originally parked in Zhangbei and were all transported back outside the Great Wall on the 5th. The types of aircraft included four fighter planes, four bomber planes, and two reconnaissance planes. One of the bomber planes had been shot down by our army and was severely damaged.

In addition, Wu Heling, a confidant of De Wang, went to Changchun on the orders of De Wang to discuss the Zhangbei puppet organization with a certain military headquarters. Currently, the chief of staff of a certain military headquarters, Itagaki, has been transferred, and the new person has not yet arrived, so Wu is still staying in Changchun. (6th)

### Japanese Establish Asia Association Xiamen Branch

Noteworthy Internal Organization: Has a Special Committee and an Inland Department

Xiamen Correspondence: When Japanese General Matsui traveled to Fujian and Guangdong two years ago and passed through Xiamen, he advocated the establishment of the "Greater Asia Association Xiamen Branch" in Xiamen. At that time, Japanese and Taiwanese residents in Xiamen had an organizing committee, but it was never formally announced. According to recent news, the "Greater Asia Association Xiamen Branch" has been established at the Kashiwabara Hotel opened by the Japanese in Gulangyu. Most of the members are Japanese and Taiwanese in Xiamen, and Yan Jinniu and others from the Tenth Army in the inland of Fujian Province have also participated. The association's internal organization has a "Special Committee" in addition to the board of directors, which is divided into five departments: General Affairs, Organization, Publicity, Public Relations, and Inland, each with selected personnel responsible for handling affairs. The association's stated purpose is to promote the unity of Asian ethnic groups to seek co-existence and co-prosperity and to maintain goodwill and peace forever. Since its establishment, it has held several board meetings. The fact that its organization includes a Special Committee and an Inland Department seems to require close attention. (March 7)

### A Glimpse of the Shantou Quarantine Station's Maltreatment of Compatriots Going Abroad

Overseas Chinese Organizations' Appeals for Relief Are Ineffective. The Quarantine Station Has Recently Become Even More Aggravated

Shantou Correspondence: Every month, tens of thousands of compatriots from Chaozhou and Meizhou counties go to Shantou to go abroad for a living. Wang Gongchen, the director of the Shantou Quarantine Station, previously stipulated that each person going abroad would be charged a quarantine fee of one silver dollar. Overseas Chinese organizations and associations in various ports believed that this practice was an egregious example and sent telegrams to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing, requesting its cancellation, but to no avail. Therefore, those who go abroad cannot board the ship without a quarantine certificate. However, even those with quarantine certificates are still subject to examination by doctors from the local immigration office after arriving in Siam, proving that the Shantou quarantine is of absolutely no benefit to compatriots in the Shan State. It was found that last month, 51 people were refused disembarkation by the Siamese side, who called it measles and ordered them to return home. Therefore, the compatriots going abroad are extremely dissatisfied with the quarantine station. The Shantou Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society has telegraphed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission again, requesting an improvement, but the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has not yet provided a satisfactory response. Unexpectedly, the quarantine station has issued a new rule that in addition to paying a fee of one dollar, two personal photos must be attached to the quarantine certificate, and the photos must be taken at a designated photo studio of the quarantine station in order to be valid. The cost of photography is particularly expensive and cannot be done in a short time. Those going abroad and organizations such as the travel industry association strongly opposed it, but it was still ineffective. The quarantine station began implementing the new rule on March 1. On the 2nd, two British ships, Guiyang and Harris, sailed to Siam, carrying more than 2,500 passengers going abroad. Because they did not have time to take photos, each person asked the quarantine station for leniency, but the quarantine station ignored them, causing great anger among the passengers, who roared loudly and shouted "Long live the Republic of China!" Unexpectedly, the quarantine station staff suddenly pulled out guns to intimidate them. As the ship was about to depart, the passengers boarded the ship one after another. The staff member, on the order of the director of the quarantine station, boarded the ship to negotiate with the captains of the two ships, ordered more than 2,000 people going abroad to be hoisted ashore, all luggage was unloaded, and ordered the two ships to postpone their departure, causing the passengers going abroad to be in a terrible situation. The shipping company immediately reported the situation to the British Consul in Shantou. The British Consul only shook his head and sighed and interceded with the quarantine station, but it was still ineffective. The Shantou Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, the Travel Industry Association, and other organizations turned to the Shantou Municipal Government to petition and negotiated with the quarantine station, but it was ultimately ineffective. On the morning of the 3rd, the shipping company again pleaded with the British Consul to negotiate with the municipal government, and it was finally allowed to re-board the ship, but more than 200 people were unable to take photos and returned to their hotels. On the 4th, various organizations in Shantou telegraphed the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, reporting the details of the case and requesting that the resolutions on protecting overseas Chinese be earnestly implemented, and that the loving care for overseas Chinese repeatedly emphasized be taken seriously. The organizations also presented petitions to the Administrative Office, the Municipal Government, and other agencies, requesting that they earnestly assist overseas Chinese going abroad. The words of the petitions were sincere, but it is not known what the effect will be.

### Fujian Province's Unified Control of Black Tea Production and Sales Has Been Realized

Joint Sales Office Has Been Established. The Sales of Fujian Fir Wood Are Also Gradually Improving

Fuzhou Correspondence: Last year, the black tea produced in eastern and northern Fujian Province sold well in the north and Southeast Asia, and tea merchants made a slight profit. This year, in order to promote foreign trade, the Construction Department decided to implement unified control of production and sales. The Fuzhou Export Black Tea Joint Sales Office was established by the department, with a capital of 800,000 yuan, of which 200,000 yuan was subscribed by tea firms as fixed capital, and 600,000 yuan was borrowed from banks by the Construction Department as working capital. From now on, the province's black tea export trade will be handled by the office. Tea firms are only responsible for purchasing tea leaves in the inland, baking, and decorating them, and then handing them over to the joint office for export. Tea firms that do not join the joint office are not allowed to engage in the export tea business. After this method was promulgated, the tea firms believed that it would hinder business development and unanimously opposed it and refused to join. Subsequently, Guan Zhongle, a counselor of the provincial government dispatched by the Construction Department, and Luo Mianhou, the chairman of the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce, convened representatives of various tea firms for several consultations, exchanged views with each other, and approved five supplementary methods from the business side. The tea firms were satisfied and agreed to join. The Fuzhou Export Black Tea Joint Sales Office has been organized and established. The office is located in the former Southeast Bank on Nan Tai Da Ling Ding. Guan Zhongle has been appointed by the Construction Department as the manager, and Luo Mianhou and Wu Shaohua have been elected by the tea firms as co-managers. A review committee has also been established, with representatives of the tea firms serving as review members. It is said that the joint sales office has established standards for the quality and decoration of exported black tea. Those that do not meet the standards are not allowed to be exported, in order to increase the value of Fujian tea and restore its reputation.

In addition, the fir wood produced in western and northern Fujian Province sold well last year because American pine wood was not exported and Taiwan timber harvesting was stopped. Therefore, timber merchants from Tianjin and Taiwan purchased from Fuzhou. The prices of all wooden sticks and wood chips have increased. This year, sales in North China are still not bad, but sales in Zhejiang and the Yangtze River area are extremely sluggish. Therefore, there are not many wooden rafts transported from northern Fujian to Fuzhou since the new year. However, recently, it has been rumored that a certain country has contacted this province to order a large number of fir wood for construction purposes. However, according to the timber industry, nothing has been heard of it. (March 6)

### Jiading: Unified Sale of Grass Products

A special handicraft industry in the eastern rural areas of this county uses yellow grass to weave slippers, sandals, cup sleeves, handbags, schoolbags, wallets, document holders, etc., which are sold in the country, Southeast Asia, the United States, and other places, with annual sales reaching more than 600,000 yuan. The Economic Construction Movement Branch of this county believes that merchants are mutually squeezing each other, indiscriminately collecting inferior goods, and manufacturers are therefore producing crudely and abusing materials, resulting in poor exports, affecting sales, and the failure is worrying. After collecting opinions from all parties, it is proposed that a sales cooperative be jointly established by the sales and manufacturing parties, and the Jiading Grass Products Unified Control Committee be organized by the branch to seek rectification and improvement. Before the cooperative is organized, the Zhongfan Grass Weaving Factory Co., Ltd. will be organized by the merchants, with a fixed capital of 100,000 yuan, which has been fully paid. The opening ceremony was held in Xuhang Town in October. The county government approved the exclusive operation for five years

It is scheduled to review them in three phases on the 13th, 17th, and 23rd of this month. On the one hand, the county government ordered the various districts to quickly send the list of township and town Baos and Chiefs who have been re-elected to the county for review. After passing the review, it will be formally announced, so that they can be sent to the provincial district for training in batches in April, and all can be completed this month.

### Summary of Bandit News in the Four Townships

The Zhang San family in Xujiang Township was visited by more than ten bandits the night before last, who wantonly robbed and burned the legs of the homeowner, causing a loss of about 100 yuan.

He immediately sent police to capture the bandit leader, who confessed. He was sent to the headquarters for interrogation on the 9th.

### Wuxi: Rice Prices Rebound and Change Direction

The local rice market, after the resumption of trading after the Lunar New Year, had few arrivals, and several newly opened rice mills wanted to purchase, so the market price increased daily. In the past half month, the sales were not good, and the market price has continued to decline, falling by nearly one yuan compared to the end of last year, and the Maan rice has also fallen by about five corners. Yesterday, there was a slight turnaround, and there is no fear of further decline.

### Zhenjiang: Armed Clashes Erupt During Anti-Smuggling Operations

Sun Xu, the captain of the tax anti-smuggling team stationed in Jinshanhe, received a tip yesterday that Bian Jinfay's family, residents of Yongdong Township in the county, hid several packages of smuggled salt from the Shouzhou gang in Anhui Province, secretly planning to transport and sell them. After receiving the tip, Captain Sun sent several armed police officers to search around midnight the night before last. However, Bian had received the news in advance and moved the smuggled goods elsewhere. When the anti-smuggling police officers arrived, they searched for half an hour without finding anything. Bian's attitude became tough because the team did not find any smuggled goods, and a conflict broke out with the team's investigating personnel. Before long, many traffickers from the Shouzhou gang heard the news and rushed to the scene. At first, there was a verbal conflict between the team members and the police officers, then they took action, wielding sticks and throwing stones. More and more participants gathered. Seeing the situation was not good, the team feared they would be outnumbered and opened fire, causing a major disturbance. About a dozen people were injured on both sides. The Zhenjiang County Government was informed afterward and immediately sent police to suppress the situation and sent the perpetrators to the county for interrogation yesterday morning. It is unknown how they will be dealt with.

### Lectures for Overseas Chinese School Teachers and Staff

To be Held in Beijing on the 15th of this Month

Penang Members to Arrive in Shanghai on the 14th

Mr. Chen Chunpu, Director of the Overseas Chinese Education Department of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, was ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the late month of the 24th year of the Republic to go to Nanyang to investigate commercial and overseas Chinese affairs and to investigate local consulates. When he passed through Penang in mid-April, Principal Chen Guang'en of Chung Ling High School, the highest Chinese school in British Malaya, organized all the Chinese school teachers and staff in Penang to host a banquet for Director Chen at the Shanghai Hotel. During the banquet, Principal Chen instructed Mr. Qian Jingcheng, a teacher at the school, to appeal to Director Chen to suggest to the central government to allocate funds to assist administrative personnel of overseas Chinese schools to return to the country to study education, so as to reform overseas Chinese education. Director Chen deeply appreciated this suggestion. After Chen completed his official duties and returned to Beijing, he drafted an implementation outline and submitted it to the central government for adoption. After a considerable period of time, the case was approved by the Executive Yuan. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission originally planned to implement it in November of last year, but due to the winter season, overseas Chinese school teachers and staff, who had lived in Nanyang for a long time, were not suitable for this climate. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission immediately announced that it would be postponed to March 15th of this year (the lecture and investigation time were each set for one month). All overseas Chinese schools in British, Dutch, Siamese, Burmese, and Philippine Islands were allowed to send students to participate in the lectures (a fixed number of 50). They would also visit Nanjing, Qingdao, Beijing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places to investigate education. All travel expenses would be borne by the overseas Chinese schools themselves, and all expenses for transportation, food, and lodging during the lectures and investigations would be provided by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. According to reliable sources, the Penang side has already nominated Principal Chen Guang'en of Chung Ling High School, Principal Zhu Yuehua of Fujian Women's School, and Principal Xu Mingzhi of Jixiao Overseas Chinese School to join the association through Consul Huang Yankai, the consul stationed in Penang. In addition, those who joined the lecture at their own expense and accompanied the investigation included Mr. Liu Weimin and Mr. Wen Jicheng, representatives of the board of directors of Chung Ling High School, Fujian Women's School, and Lizexue School, and Principal Su Bingzhang of Lizexue School. Each of these members is scheduled to leave Penang for Singapore on the 5th of this month, and take the German post ship Soharnorst via the Philippines back to China on the 7th. They are scheduled to arrive here on the 14th and take the Beijing-Shanghai train to Beijing to report.

(4) Course Guide - Appointed by the principal, responsible for guiding the course.

6. Experimentation and Research

Experimentation is an important task of the school. The experimental work carried out by the school can be briefly described in two aspects as follows:

(1) Comparative Experimentation of Teaching Problems: Conducted in four steps:

(1) Preparation Period: The first step is theoretical preparation, such as reading education experimental methods; the second step is methodological preparation, such as selecting experimental problems and determining experimental methods; the third step is tool preparation, such as editing experimental materials and tests.

(2) Experimentation Period: Such as testing, grouping, preliminary testing, experimentation, retesting, etc.

(3) Calculation Period: Such as calculating progress and regression numbers, winning points, experimental coefficients, etc.

(4) Reporting Period: Such as compiling reports, printing, etc.

Experiments that have already yielded results include:

(1) A comparative experiment on the use of the circular method and the direct method in arranging fraction teaching materials. The results indicate that the circular method is more suitable.

(2) A comparative experiment on explaining stroke order and not explaining stroke order in writing instruction. The results indicate that explaining stroke order is more suitable.

(3) A comparative experiment on the problem of composition correction. The results indicate that correction is more suitable.

(4) A comparative experiment on the teaching methods of principles and theories in arithmetic. The results indicate that the inductive method is more suitable.

(5) A comparative experiment on the problem of memorizing short modern vernacular texts. The results indicate that memorization is more suitable.

Detailed reports are available in special volumes for the above five experiments. The results of other small-problem experiments have been compiled into the first report of small-problem experiments, the second report, and a preliminary compilation of the school's small-problem results, with summaries.

From the 23rd year of the Republic, the five Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Primary Schools, in order to improve the efficiency of experimental education and concentrate the experimental efforts of each school, jointly organized an Experimental Research Committee to coordinate experimental research matters, to notify each other of the determination of experimental problems, and to compile and report to the Department of Education by the Committee, so as to avoid duplication of experimental problems and waste of experimental efforts. This method has been tried for two years and has been quite effective.

In the first Experimental Research Committee of the 24th year of the Republic, in order to further concentrate experimental efforts and enhance the accuracy of experiments, a principle was established to jointly experiment on a number of problems, so that each problem would have experimental results from five schools, which could be mutually verified and further improve the reliability of accuracy. Among the common experimental problems, two were experimented on in the first semester of the 25th year of the Republic, namely:

Tianjin Traders Actively Buying Spot Yarn

Short Covering Begins

Far-Term Sentiment Becomes More Positive

The yarn market was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon, and the situation did not deviate from the overall fluctuation trend. However, most targets were bearish, anticipating that yarn mill output would gradually increase, and there were still many people who sold off on rallies, so the pressure was heavy. Most of the former supporters of Indian merchants have already turned from long to short. There are rumors of deliveries, with a quota of 12,000 bales scheduled for the 22nd. However, the global cotton industry is still in good condition, and buyers are also holding on tightly. Spot yarn traders from the Tianjin region are actively buying on the North Road. After noon, sentiment improved and market prices returned to a favorable level. Yarn in warehouses is making every effort to sell, and it is said that more than 1,100 bales were sold yesterday.

Standard Yarn Falls in the Morning and Rises in the Afternoon

At the opening of the standard yarn market in the morning, slight declines were seen in each month due to the consecutive days of gains in the prices of Grade 3 American cotton and yarn. However, the degree of decline was very slight. When auctioned to the far term, it was seen to rise instead. After the second session, the near term was weak and the far term was strong. By the time of closing, it was reported that the closing price of Grade 3 yarn had rebounded, and sentiment rose slightly. Spot yarn traders from the northern region still had an appetite. Each month rebounded by a few dimes. As a result, the closing price of standard yarn for each month fell by three or four dimes compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the far term rose by one dime. At the opening of the afternoon session, the market situation was tight, because Grade 3 yarn had risen again, and yarn sales to Tianjin continued to be strong. Moreover, more than 1,000 bales were sold from warehouses, and short covering caused another rise. The third session rebounded slightly. By the time of closing, it was reported that spot yarn was traded for more than 2,000 bales, and far-term sentiment remained positive.

The Decline in American and Indian Cotton is Slight

Few Are Bearish on Cotton

Cotton Market Rebounds in the Afternoon Following Yarn Market

The cotton market was weak in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the market trend slightly shifted towards firmness, because American cotton rose sharply and had a small pullback, and the decline in Indian cotton was also slight. Therefore, there was no enthusiastic selling, and the market sentiment was still stable. The demand from spot cotton mills has become quiet again.

Standard Cotton Results Rebound Slightly

At the opening of the standard cotton market in the morning, American cotton, which had risen for a long time, retreated by 13 to 17 points, and Indian cotton fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees. Sentiment was still peaceful because the decline in foreign cotton was not intense, and there were no enthusiastic sellers. The auction was unchanged until the end of the month. There was a slight change after the second session. As a result, the closing price of standard cotton for each month fell by one to two dimes compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was good at the opening of the afternoon session, and it was even more popular when auctioned to the far term. Because the yarn market rebounded, the upward force of Grade 3 cotton was particularly strong, and short covering caused it to be firm. As a result, the closing price for each month rose by 1.5 to 3 dimes compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that Dafu sold 3,900 dan, Jifeng 2,500 dan, Juxing 1,700 dan, Daji 1,800 dan, Yuanyi 6,700 dan, Dachangcheng 6,800 dan, Yichang 1,600 dan, Yikang 5,000 dan, Xinchang 7,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 9,100 dan, Shenchang 3,300 dan, Taichang 6,300 dan, and Tonghe 2,100 dan.

The Spot Price of American Cotton Remains Firm

There Was a Short Covering Rally Before Closing

The Decline in Yesterday's Telegraph Results Was Still Slight

Yesterday's American cotton market opened extremely actively. Prices fell sharply by 23 to 38 points in each month due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and large-scale profit-taking by bulls. Subsequently, spot cotton was strong, spot traders and industry peers absorbed as much as possible. At the same time, short covering also occurred, and market prices rebounded. Before closing, industry peers bought, and the market trend rose again, especially in the far month. The closing was firm. Spot prices fell by 13 points, futures prices fell by 13 to 18 points, British cotton spot prices fell by 4 points, and futures prices fell by 4 to 5 points.

The Selling Price is 2.5 Dimes Cheaper Than East Goods

Yesterday, spot sales in the cloth market progressed, and sales prices were consistently stable. The rising trend of East goods 84 cloth Jumping Dance brand has slightly stabilized. The Huahua Shenxin factory Fisherman brand has been discontinued for a long time, but has recently reappeared. The price is cheaper than East goods (per piece) by about 2.5 dimes, which is quite popular in the market. Dozens of bales have been purchased by this street and Guang traders.

### Grain

Flour Sales Are Silent

Yesterday, the flour market showed a trend of weakness followed by a rise in each month. The prices of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada rebounded by 8 to 12 dimes. Liverpool fell by one pence and zero. When prices opened, market sentiment was once depressed due to the ups and downs of foreign wheat, so this month's opening price was as low as 4.01 yuan. With this low price, short covering was hurried, and the market rebounded as a result. Below the second session, there was only short covering, and long positions did not come out smoothly. This month once rose as high as 4.0525 yuan. The other months were all up by about 2 points. When the afternoon session opened, the recent sentiment became weak again and fell by one point compared to the morning, because spot sales were still not active. The months of July and August were little changed. At present, the market situation is ultimately difficult to stabilize due to the lack of spot sales.

River Rice Prices Are Being Revised Daily

(North Shanghai) 34 Niansan boats arrived at the dam. Transactions in each cargo were unusually quiet. High-quality white japonica rice prices were weak by several points, while medium-quality rice was down by about one dime. Bo rice was down by 6 or 7 points. Top-quality Yangxian rice was weak, while medium-quality goods and Bu rice prices were down by 3 or 5 points. Yinbian yuan rice prices were down by 7 or 8 points. Prices of other goods have also been revised.

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources from various traders, with a total of 8,400 to 8,500 stones of goods, mostly thick japonica rice. Thick japonica rice sales were sluggish, and market conditions continued to fall by about one dime. Tianjin traders still bought more than 1,000 packages of thin rice, but local sales were very weak, resulting in mixed market colors. Retail sales were down by one dime. In short, the output of thin rice, bulk purchases, and retail sales are completely different. Foreign traders only look at whether there is transportation, while they only rely on changes in the weather and the amount of source arrivals, so there is a disparate phenomenon. Dujian is soft, and Yangjian has been out of stock for a long time, so it is quite fresh. Yin yuan is mediocre.

New Wheat Market Needs to Watch the Weather

Yesterday's wheat market was generally stable at the opening in the morning. This month, because the two sides were mutually exclusive, there was little fluctuation. In April, because the number of households was very scarce, and it was close to this month, it was therefore called higher by 3 or 5 points. Below June, because there were few customer exits, it was also called better by 1 or 2 points. At the opening of the afternoon session, this month was raised by 5 points because the arrival was not smooth and the production area price was also not cheap. In April, the bulls came out and fell by 2 or 3 points. Below June, it was generally fluctuating. Only the August sentiment was slightly better. At present, if the arrival source of Chen wheat is strong, it should not be too strong. If the new wheat has mild weather, sentiment will be easier to gradually level off. In the spot wheat market, the asking price was slightly reduced by 2 or 3 points due to the factory's lack of greed. Kaikai Tiantai wheat was 6.63 yuan and Chongming wheat was 6.53 yuan, with an estimated 1,000 packages.

Flour is Shipped North to Tianjin

Xian Rice is Shipped South to Guangdong Province

Among the goods shipped from this city to the Beiyang region, miscellaneous grains and flour are the main items. Two weeks ago, due to the New Year holidays and price relations, there was a period of stagnation, but it has recently become active again. It is reported that the total amount of flour shipped to Tianjin last week was approximately 500,000 bags. Today and tomorrow, there are more than 100,000 bags. It is reported that there is a large amount of flour waiting to be shipped. Since Yue Province experienced a rice panic, Da Shang has purchased from the Yangtze River and shipped it directly from Xunwu and other places. Even the transshipment in this city is not small. Today, the Haili, Taiyuan, Risheng, and Mingsheng wheels went to Guangdong, carrying more than 40,000 bags of rice.

Soybean Market Remains Firm

Standard oil beans continue to rise in the market. Oil rose by about three dimes, beans rose by four or five points, and the cake market was unchanged. However, at the opening in Shanghai in the morning, the bulls came out quite a bit, and new purchases were also light, so the market could not continue to climb. However, the spot soybeans have been actively depleted by Japanese customers, and the factory appetite is particularly greedy, so the incoming goods from various industries are clearing, so standard beans are being covered strongly, and the market has been pulled up by the connected market, and the market has gradually improved, and the closing price has risen by 4 to 6 points. Standard oil shops do not come out, and the price is also good by one dime and a half. Standard cake sales are more prevalent, but the price is still down by about one point.

Yesterday, the soybean market was restrained by the Dalian telegram report, but the sales area continued, and the market was able to stand, and the market was elevated by one or two points compared to the previous market. A total of four cars of Yingzhou beans, three cars of Bengbu beans, 800 packages of Tancheng beans, more than 150 packages of Suqian beans, more than 200 packages of Shashi beans, more than 1,300 packages of Dudu Shayang, more than 1,500 packages of Hankou beans, and 350 packages of late beans, more than 300 packages of Jiujiang winter beans were transacted.

B-grade white factories largely sold off at prices ranging from 745 yuan to 755 yuan. Foreign firms' ash gray trading had been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and other firms purchased 80 packages. For user silk, silk weaving factories in various places have now started operations, and the demand for raw materials is gradually becoming urgent. Therefore, there are many transactions in silk for both local and foreign use, and market prices are stable without much fluctuation. Yesterday, the total number of transactions in the city was 242 packages.

### Dried and Preserved Fruits

Walnut Sales Remain Sluggish

Walnut sales have been sluggish recently, and the trend continues to weaken. Currently, the market price for hand-picked walnuts is 26-27 yuan, Changping walnuts are 18-19 yuan, Bozhou walnuts are 16-17 yuan, Shimen walnuts are 23-24 yuan to 22 yuan, and Shilu walnuts are 14-15 yuan.

### Hardware

New Galvanized Iron Wire Prices Slightly Lower

The trading of new galvanized iron wire has been very active recently. The market selling price for No. 16 to No. 20 is estimated at 14 yuan per dan, and No. 21 to No. 25 is estimated at 17.5 yuan, both of which are about 1-2 yuan lower than before. However, customers and factories are reluctant to buy at these prices. It is reported that overseas factories have set prices for No. 16 to No. 20 at 22 pounds per ton (equivalent to about 21 yuan per dan in Shanghai), and No. 21 to No. 25 is priced at 32 pounds (equivalent to over 30 yuan per dan in Shanghai), which is higher than the prices in Shanghai.

### Statistics

Production Index for the Second Half of Last Year

The Economic Research Department of the Central Bank released the production index for the second half of the 25th year of the Republic as follows:

Starting from July of the 25th year of the Republic, the monthly indexes for flour and matches have not yet been obtained for Sichuan materials. For the item of cotton yarn in November, not all regions have arrived. In December, cotton yarn, cigarettes, and beer are missing, so the total index is not calculated for the time being. The output of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces was not previously included, so it is still not included in the calculation for comparison purposes. Starting from January of the 26th year of the Republic, it is planned to thoroughly organize the statistical materials, and the index will also be revised. At that time, the output of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces will be included in the calculation.

### Compilation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (6)

— Pan Shihao

(3) Business Registration Statement

(7) Business Year: The business year is the year determined in the accounting final accounts, also known as the accounting year. According to Articles 166 and 260 of the Company Law, at the end of each business year, the directors or unlimited liability shareholders of limited companies and limited partnerships should prepare final account statements, etc., and submit them to the supervisors for review in preparation for reporting to the shareholders' meeting. Although the Company Law does not have the term "business year" for unlimited companies and partnerships, the distribution of profits and the calculation of the Class 1 profit-seeking enterprise income tax are dependent on the annual final accounts. Therefore, it is also necessary to determine the business year. Therefore, Article 8 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that the income of Class 1 A and B profit-seeking enterprises should be settled once a year. The start and end of this type of year, if using the calendar year system, is from January 1 to December 31 each year. If not using the calendar year system, a date can be chosen according to the habits of each industry or practical convenience. As long as it satisfies twelve months, it becomes a year. The information to be filled in on this form is the start and end dates. For example, from March 1 each year to the end of February of the following year, or ending with the merchant's total closing period each year, etc. According to Article 8 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the income of Class 1 A and B profit-seeking enterprises should be reported to the competent collection agency within three months after the annual settlement by the taxpayers. The so-called settlement is the final account. This year is the first year for the collection of Class 1 profit-seeking enterprise income tax. If the business year does not follow the calendar year system, from January 1 of the 26th year of the Republic to the day before the start of this business year, the income should be settled and reported separately according to Articles 9 and 22 of the Implementing Regulations. For merchants whose business ends this year according to the merchant's total closing period (i.e., ending on February 10), the government authorities are still considering how to report the Class 1 profit-seeking enterprise income from January 1 to February 10. However, it has been announced that it will be reported separately at the end of this year.

(8) Remarks: The remarks section is used to fill in matters other than the various matters mentioned above. There are usually two items to be filled in: (1) Reserve fund. According to Article 7 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 11 of the Taxpayer Instructions for Class 1 Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax, the reserve fund set aside by the company in accordance with laws and regulations can be included in the capital calculation by one-third to calculate the percentage of income to the actual amount of capital. This reserve fund refers to the reserve fund stipulated in Article 170 of the Company Law. It is greatly related to the calculation of future income tax and should be filled in the remarks section. (2) Main and branch stores. According to Article 6 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 2 of the Draft Collection Instructions for Class 1 Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax, if the main store and its branch stores are both in the country, the income can be calculated together, except for those with completely independent capital and business. Therefore, this type of branch store should be filled in the remarks section of this form first and report the reason for the joint calculation for future reference. If the person filling in this form is a branch store and the capital is not divided, the words "capital is in the main store" can be filled in the total number of shares and the paid-up share capital section, and the name and location of the main store can be filled in the remarks section. If the branch store meets the provisions of Article 5 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 5 of the Draft Collection Instructions for Class 1 Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax and should calculate its income separately, and remove the profits from the business in the foreign part, it should be filled in the remarks section of this form.

(9) Date of Filing: The date of filing this form should also be filled in on this form. The information filled in on this form should be the situation at the time of the filing date. If there are changes in the future, no matter what kind of matter is changed, a report of the change should be made. (To be continued)

National Goods Special Issue

Contributions

### The Effectiveness of Visiting Housewives

— Yang An

The National Goods Movement United Association of this city has been conducting visits to housewives for half a year. Although it has not been universally effective, according to conversations with the staff of National Goods Companies and various factories, many customers have come from these visits.

One morning, I met Mr. Song Hanzhang, a senior member of the banking industry, at the Wuhe Weaving Factory. He was choosing cotton sweaters and said that his family unanimously admired national goods and could come to buy them on their own without waiting for visits. Mr. Song, as an authority in the domestic financial industry, has such faith in national goods. How should we in the national goods industry strive to live up to Mr. Song's kindness and enthusiasm?

Another day, I went to the Kangyuan Factory to visit Mr. Kangyuan. A phone call came from a certain public residence. Mrs. Li said that she planned to give toys to the children of relatives as New Year's gifts during the Lunar New Year to replace New Year's money. After listening to the report of the female visitor, she said that the toys of your factory are rich in educational meaning, so please send some samples first for bulk purchase. The effectiveness of the visits can be seen again.

Recently, someone entrusted me to buy a large number of light bulbs from Yapu, and someone asked about the glass cups and various new medicines of the Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, various fabrics of the Sanyou Society Hongxin Factory, and the cosmetics and various colors of silk satin of the China Chemical Industry Society and Wuzhou. All said that they came from the mouths of the female visitors. From these messages, it can be seen that everything depends on human effort. Housewives, who does not love the country, who has no conscience, who does not enjoy using national goods, who does not believe in national products? It only needs someone to explain and advise and provide various kinds of guidance.

### Establish a National Goods Market at the City God Temple

— Ms. Qiao Jianhua

This Lunar New Year, some friends came from the inland. I inevitably accompanied them to various places to play. One afternoon, we arrived at the City God Temple in Nanshi. The lively and crowded situation need not be said. What is most worthy of our attention there is the various shops and stalls. I am afraid that more than 90% of the things displayed are imported goods. Especially those manufactured by our friendly ally occupy the vast majority.

We went upstairs to a dim sum shop to eat some dim sum with unique flavors. Everyone discussed this serious problem and at the same time saw the small world amusement park on the opposite side that had been destroyed. The house has not been repaired to this day. It is believed that this site can be used to design a complete national goods market.

Our opinions can be summarized as follows:

First, the City God Temple in Shanghai is a world-famous location. Many foreigners who come to Shanghai for the first time or who have lived in Shanghai for a long time also go to visit. Seeing the current situation of imported goods flooding the market, isn't it undermining the Taiwanese of our people? From an international perspective, establishing a national goods market at the City God Temple is necessary.

Second, the location of the National Goods Market on Nanjing Road in Shanghai does not seem to be the best, but the business is still relatively developed. However, people living in Nanshi often feel inconvenient to buy. Visiting the City God Temple is something that people from the inland or people living in Shanghai want to do. Then, buying some daily necessities along the way is also human nature. Establishing a national goods market here, with the superior location of the City God Temple, business development can be guaranteed.

Third, the small world amusement park was destroyed. In the current era when amusement parks have reached the end of the road, it does not seem necessary to rush to restore it alone. Why not rebuild the entire site of the small world into a five-story cement building? The ground floor can still be rented to various shops as it is now, but one condition is to sell national goods. The second and third floors are national goods department stores. The fourth floor can be used as office space. The fifth floor can be used as an amusement park. Then, the scale will be grand and the market will be prosperous, which is not a problem.

Fourth, the landlords of the small world site are said to be several. Most of them are owned by the Pudong Sanlin School Board of Directors. The school directors are all enthusiastic patriots. Then, the association's approval of this plan is undoubtedly. The other part is owned by the municipal government, which does not seem to be a problem. If a national goods organization or the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs initiates it and contacts the local landlords and the City God Temple Board of Directors to organize a design committee to be responsible for the implementation, then everyone will work together easily. The realization of the national goods market is not difficult.

Fifth, the fundraising of funds. The landlords can pay the construction costs, and the national goods factories can pay the operating costs. Or another company can be formed. Or the factories can jointly operate. Or women can be fully responsible for managing the retail. Establishing a model of women's commerce can all be left to the design committee to discuss and decide on specific methods. I will not mention it here for the time being.

Such superficial opinions, can they be implemented in practice? I hope that the wise authorities, patriotic citizens, and national goods manufacturers will come together to seek more complete and concrete methods and gradually turn from words into facts. Then, throwing a brick to attract jade, the author's Lunar New Year tour of the City God Temple felt absolutely meaningful.

### From Trade Deficits to Joint Production and Sales by National Goods Industries

— Cheng Xuepeng

, using armed force as their backing to evade this only tariff. Or, more simply, they set up factories in China, using China's cheap raw materials and labor, and under their scientific management, manufactured a large number of commodities to dump in various places, monopolizing our country's market. In this situation, how can the national goods industry raise its head?

(2) Transportation Problems - Transportation is the key element for industrial development. Our country's railways are not developed, and highways are also inconvenient. Therefore, most of the transportation of goods relies on navigation, and the sovereignty of our country's inland river navigation is in the hands of foreigners. Therefore, the fate of the development of national goods is also controlled by foreigners. Although there are also state-owned and Chinese-owned shipping companies, the proportion is so small that it is often not enough to allocate, so we have to rely on foreign ships. Foreign ships carry national goods, and the freight is expensive and often slow. Moreover, there are still customs scandals, and the result is that Chinese businessmen can only sigh in despair!

Judging from the above two points alone, it is indeed difficult for national goods to achieve final victory. However, I believe that in addition to removing all obstacles that may hinder the development of the national goods industry, the only way is for national goods industrial factories to implement a joint production and sales system. Why is this? The reasons are described below:

(1) After the implementation of joint production and sales, it is possible to investigate the needs of the market, control the production quantity and sales price, and avoid the impact of oversupply and cheap competition.

(2) Standardize the standards to standardize production.

(3) Raw materials can be purchased in large quantities by the "Joint Production and Sales Office of the Industry" and distributed to various factories, reducing costs.

(4) Establish a research institute to specialize in the products of the industry. When better manufacturing methods are discovered, they should be secretly disclosed, and all factories should benefit from them.

(5) Due to joint production and sales, it is possible to control the product market and compete with imported goods.

(6) Because the production and sales affairs are handled by the "Joint Production and Sales Office of the Industry," the expenses of each factory can be reduced.

The above six items are all the benefits of joint production and sales by national goods industrial factories. The specific plan for its implementation is beyond the scope of this article, so it is omitted.

Opening up the annual customs trade book, we know that our country has had huge trade deficits over the years. Therefore, people are worried and believe that the reason why national goods cannot raise their heads is entirely due to trade deficits. In fact, this is an overestimation. My opinion is as follows:

(1) In our country with backward industry, we have to rely on foreign goods for many things, and trade deficits are inevitable.

(2) Import trade is divided into tangible and intangible. Tangible means imported goods, and intangible includes foreign investment, remittances from overseas Chinese, and travel expenses for foreigners coming to China, etc. At the same time, we must know that international payments are not necessarily paid directly in cash, but are mostly taken in the form of goods. After the European War, the following two phenomena occurred in our country's international trade:

(1) Years with larger trade deficits were years with more silver inflow.

(2) Years with increased export trade were years with more silver outflow.

From the above, it can be seen that trade deficits are not necessarily cash outflows, and cash inflows are not necessarily trade surpluses. Therefore, in reality, trade deficits are not as serious as generally thought. On the contrary, we should allow for trade deficits.

As for the problem that national goods cannot raise their heads, it is complicated and cannot be fully described in this article. Now I would like to raise only the most important point, hoping that those who promote the national goods movement and national goods manufacturers across the country will pay attention.

This point is the issue of "joint production and sales by national goods industrial factories." Before describing the importance of this issue, we must first review the current environment of national goods.

(1) Tax Collection Issues - Although our country's tariff rate is several times lower than that of any independent country, imperialists still complain that it is too high.

### Introducing "A Light Cavalry Unit of the National Products Movement"

— Ms. Xu Songzi

I remember when the home visit work had just started, Mr. Yang Ang once told us, "Housewives are the main body of purchasing national products. If housewives are enthusiastic about national products, the way out for national products will naturally be unimpeded. But how to open up this way out is the task of female visitors."

At present, the home visit work has been going on for half a year, and it has been deeply supported by thousands of housewives. Anyone who thinks that what should be discussed is not to remove obstacles on the way out, but to lay the foundation for the work, that would be an incredibly foolish view.

For those unwise doubts, facts will naturally refute their fallacies. What we always keep in mind is how to remedy the shortcomings of the work and make the work go more smoothly?"

From actual work, we deeply feel that each meeting with a housewife, although it is to look at the situation at the time and make appropriate remarks, it is considered achieved only after attracting people and then turning to the topic. However, on the other hand, due to concerns about the universality of work efficiency, we have to end the conversation in a short time. Therefore, it is inevitable that there are places where the meaning is not fully expressed. Moreover, in today's market filled with foreign goods, the average housewife has the pain of not being able to distinguish the authenticity of national products. Even after detailed explanations, it is inevitable that there will be places of "missing one out of ten thousand" due to too many goods.

Secondly, the gift coupons and promotional materials entrusted to us by various manufacturers have been quite effective, and most of them are considered luxurious and practical, but because the paper colors of each factory are different, they are not suitable for long-term preservation and are difficult to have a lasting effect. As for the national product publications that we have handled and seen daily, the number is also quite large. If we investigate the actual situation, except for this journal – the National Products Special Issue – and a few similar publications that have her serious significance in guiding the national products movement, most of them emphasize advertising over content. Although the editors themselves believe they are doing everything possible to promote, they make people see them as "advertising publications" at first glance, and whether they are welcomed is imaginable. However, the general housewives' hope for the supply of good reading materials is also a very practical thing.

The above-mentioned shortcomings, although small personal opinions, should not be ignored for the future of the visit work (that is, the future of the national products movement).

How to remedy these shortcomings, we have had a long period of consideration, that is, the publication of the "Housewives' Friend" bi-monthly, which is to be introduced in this article as a light cavalry unit in the national products movement?

We believe that under the current situation, there are very few publications that are based on promoting national products and have rich content. As for those that can cater to the psychology of housewives and penetrate into families, there are even fewer. We hope that this "Housewives' Friend" that we edit and publish in our spare time can make a small contribution.

What we hope for "Housewives' Friend" is: –

(1) She will have a luxurious appearance and rich content, so that housewives will be deeply influenced by the national products propaganda in "subtle influence."

(2) To systematically introduce national products, to make up for the shortcomings of our conversations with housewives. To constantly discuss the general methods of identifying national products, so that housewives will not mistakenly buy foreign goods. And to set up a national product consultation column, reserved for housewives to consult.

(3) Standing in the position of housewives, to criticize national products with a fair attitude, so that excellent products can show their advantages even more; those who are roughly manufactured will have the opportunity to improve.

(4) To open a special column for "National Products Market", to classify and compile the national products needed for daily life, so that housewives can have the convenience of "finding what they need according to the map" when purchasing goods.

(5) Advertisements and gift coupons from various manufacturers can be inserted in attached pages. This can save the cost of printing each one, and also give housewives the value and effect of permanent cherishing.

(7) Each issue is published and delivered to the hands of housewives by the visitors, so that the housewives and the visitors can maintain a permanent and sincere friendship, and in fact, it is to promote their broad and profound views on the national products movement.

Naturally, our ability is very weak. However, whether we can shoulder this important task is not what we want to ask. What we want to ask is, do national product movement activists under the iron hooves of foreign goods have the need to rise up, fight for the "main body of purchasing national products," weave their own light cavalry unit, and attack foreign goods?

Finally, we are reaching out our hands here, and we hope that all those who sympathize with us will not hesitate to lend a helping hand!

### Idle Talk on Gift Giving

— Wang Yongtao

We are deposited in society, and for the sake of connecting feelings and all other relationships, it is inevitable to be active in the custom of giving gifts! If your friend has a happy event, after you receive the invitation, you will have to plan to send a gift. However, the gift must be welcomed by the other party, otherwise, if the gift is not given properly, it will cause the other party's displeasure. What I have seen recently is a very good example. My friend Mr. Li got married last month. When I heard this good news, I sent him a national product gift certificate. At the same time, his relatives and friends also came to give gifts in droves. Later, after Mr. Li carefully checked all the gifts, except for a few cash and calligraphy scrolls, three-quarters of them were gift certificates from various major companies. Mr. Li has always advocated national products. He shook his head and said to me, "Alas! Why don't you change so many gift certificates to national product gift certificates? How can I redeem national products?..." From this, you can know the necessity of considering gift giving.

The China National Products Company and Sanyou Industrial Company in Shanghai are both very great pure domestic stores. The goods they sell, such as cloth, woolen fabrics, cosmetics, etc., are simply all-inclusive, and they issue national product gift certificates, which are very exquisite and simple. You can redeem them for goods at any time. If you give this gift certificate to relatives and friends, they will not only be very welcome, but also admire you as a patriotic element who promotes national products. Therefore, the author sincerely hopes that you, the readers, will adopt national product gift certificates in the future, so that there will be unlimited hope for the development of national products.

On the 6th, he and embassy secretary Huang Bodu, staff members Hu Mai, Chen Gongliang, Lin Banfu, Zhang Jingwu, Zhou Zhongpo, Yang Bannong and other eight people departed from Yokohama on the Changxing Shipping Company's Empress of Canada and returned to China. He arrived in Shanghai at 12:00 noon yesterday and berthed at the Shippers Wharf. Many people from all walks of life in China and Japan arrived to welcome him. Mr. Xu does not intend to stay in Shanghai for long, and will immediately go to Nanjing to pay respects to Foreign Minister Wang and report on his duties. The details are as follows:

Welcome from All Walks of Life

The Empress of Canada entered the port at 11:00 and berthed at the Shippers Wharf at 12:00. In addition to Ambassador Xu's wife, those who arrived to welcome him from all walks of life included Yan Zhuang, representative of President Yu of the Control Yuan, Li Yuwan, representative of Deputy Prime Minister Kong of the Executive Yuan, former Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, Zhang Benshun, representative of Director Zhang Zhizhong of the Central Military Academy, Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting, Li Dachao, representative of Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Shanghai Police Chief Cai Jingjun, Central Committee members Fang Zhi and Shao Hua, and Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Zhu Ziqiao, Qu Wenliu, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Huang Yanpei, Guan Tongzhi, Lu Bohong, Hu Xuan'an, Wen Lanting, Zhang Keyao, Xu Jingren, Wang Dasui, Lin Kanghou, Huang Hanzhi and others, as well as representatives of various charitable organizations in Shanghai, representatives of various public groups, and representatives of the Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai, the Hui Ning Native Place Association, Lu Yinan, Cao Zhigong, Jiang Kaichen, Wu Mucong, and principals, faculty, and students of Anhui Public School in Shanghai and Hui Ning School, numbering no less than four or five thousand people, blocking the road.

Then he went to visit the former chief executive's residence on Avenue Joffre to offer condolences, and visited Mayor Wu and former Foreign Minister Zhang. It is heard that he will go to Nanjing in the next day or two to pay respects to Foreign Minister Wang and report on his duties.

Written Statement

I was ordered to serve as ambassador to Japan, and departed on March 6 last year to take up my post. This time I am asking for leave to report on my duties, and also left the embassy on March 6 to return to China. During this year, I have handled everything in accordance with the orders of the Central Government. Although I have passively been fortunate enough not to increase diplomatic difficulties, I have not actively established any achievements. Recalling the grand enthusiasm of the people of the country and friends from all sides when I was sent off, and the earnest expectations, I feel extremely ashamed. During my tenure, various incidents occurred continuously. First, there was the Guangdong-Guangxi Incident, followed by the Qingjin Consulate Case, and the injuries to Japanese residents in the concession of Chengdu, Beihai, Shanghai and Hankou came one after another. Finally, there was the invasion of Suiyuan by bandits and puppets, which led to the Xi'an Incident that shocked the world. The changes and ups and downs all produced subtle reflections on diplomacy. Diplomatic personnel were also in a state of tension and excitement every day. However, I have a very firm belief that the great cause of unity of our government will surely be completed, and that the people of the whole country will be able to remain calm and steadfast, and under the leadership of the government, take orderly steps to advance towards the road of national rejuvenation. I will never be pessimistic, and I also hope that friendly countries will not despise us. I have earnestly told the Japanese government and the public that the rapid resolution of the Xi'an Incident and the spirit of unity of our people in supporting the leader have provided great proof and are seen by the world. Therefore, all parties in Japan are singing the saying of re-examining and re-understanding China. This is the true expression of what I said when I was about to leave the country, "It is internal and not external, and it is better to seek oneself than to seek others." It is very gratifying. Today, the country is still at a critical juncture of survival, and the key is related to the endless misfortunes of the nation. I deeply hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will be conscientious and work together to overcome difficulties. Take Japan as an example. Its people are hardworking and industrious, and its industry and commerce are developing. Its research in academics is thorough in old studies, and its progress in new studies is long-term. It is good at creating for reasons, so it can build a foundation of wealth and strength. This is what we should catch up with quickly, so as not to be ashamed of being the most backward country with the oldest culture and history. I am determined that diplomacy should take justice as its purpose, and that the success of achieving justice must be based on absolute sincerity. Therefore, everything in Japan is based on justice and sincerity, and I follow the instructions of the Central Government to deal with it. In terms of diplomatic technology, I advocate that it should be in an active position, and should not be controlled by others in everything and be in a passive position. Although success cannot be guaranteed, it should always be done in this way. However, I feel that to study and observe the national conditions of a country, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of its history, culture, customs, and human feelings. It is a very painful thing to force a blind person to see and a dumb person to speak. This time, I can take a short break, and I deeply hope that the government, for the sake of developing proactive and just diplomacy, can enable foreign envoys to fully exert the function of the country's vision and hearing, and make it easier for them to progress.

### Press Colleagues Held a Banquet to Celebrate Mayor Wu's Fiftieth Birthday

Wang Boqi Delivered a Congratulatory Speech and Hu Pu'an Presented a Screen

According to the Central News Agency, yesterday was Mayor Wu of Shanghai's fiftieth birthday. Because Mayor Wu did not want to be extravagant, he tried to hide it in every possible way. Only press colleagues knew about it. Because Mr. Wu has been in office for five years, benefiting the local people, and has been able to do his best to maintain the news industry, they held a public celebration banquet at Xinghualou on the evening of the 6th and presented a marble engraving of "Like the Sun at Noon" as a birthday screen. Representatives from various newspapers including Shen Bao Li Yonggeng, Ma Yinliang, Zhou Mengxiong, Xinwen Bao Wang Boqi, Wang Weizhen, Li Haoran, Yan Duhe, Shibao Huang Bohui, Shishi Xinbao Cui Weiwu, Fan Gongbi, Min Bao Hu Xuan'an, Guan Ji'an, Yuan Yeyu, Zhonghua Ribao Liang Xiuyu, Guo Xiufeng, Dagong Bao Zhang Weiluan, Li Zikuan, Wang Yunsheng, Libao Wu Zhongyi, Dalu Bao Dong Guangxian, Yang Guangxian, Dawan Bao Zeng Xubai, and Shenzhou Ribao Jiang Guangtang were present, and Secretary-General Yu, bureau chiefs, Section Chief Li Dachao, Secretary Chen Kecheng, Secretary Chen Xunxiao, and Director Feng Youzhen of the Central News Agency were invited to accompany them. During the banquet, Wang Boqi delivered a congratulatory speech, saying that this year we are happy to celebrate Mayor Wu's fiftieth birthday. Shanghai press colleagues deeply admire the mayor's various political achievements over the past five years, as well as his hard work and perseverance in maintaining local security. Therefore, today we take this opportunity of a public birthday banquet to express our admiration briefly. Mayor Wu is the most constructive politician in the party and the country, and he is also a strict soldier. In the past, all the facilities in Guangzhou, as well as the mediation of the non-northern easy banner incident, and the promotion of China's unification, are facts that the whole country has seen. Since taking office as mayor of this city, it has coincided with the serious national crisis. There have been various battles in Songhu, the Great Wall, and Sui East, as well as the Xi'an Incident that shocked the world on December 12 last year. These short five years are the most difficult stage in our country's history. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, with a mixture of Chinese and foreigners. Its importance is not only the barrier of the southeast half of the country, but also the concentration of national resources and wealth. In a special environment, it is a place that is most difficult to deal with when it comes into contact with foreign forces on the one hand and the uneven quality of residents on the other hand. In the process of stormy waves, the mayor seems to be the chief helmsman of the city's 3.7 million people, who can lead the citizens to a safe area or to a dangerous area. As a result of Mayor Wu's efforts, he has after all led the citizens to a safe area. Since the beginning of this year, although the national crisis has not been resolved, our nation has indeed stepped into the path of rejuvenation step by step. At the time of the bright spring, we are happy to celebrate Mayor Wu's fiftieth birthday. In addition to expressing our respect for the mayor's past political achievements, we also want to wish the mayor all the best in the future. The souvenir we presented to Mayor Wu is engraved with the four characters "Like the Sun at Noon". The reason is that fifty years old is a period of rich experience and full of energy. In ancient times, people established virtue, established words, and established merit, often after the "strong and prosperous years". The achievements of modern politicians and great scholars in various countries are also mostly after the age of fifty. Ancient and modern China and foreign countries are all the same. We still remember that last October, the whole country congratulated Chairman Chiang on his fiftieth birthday. Today, we are here to celebrate Mayor Wu's fiftieth birthday. The time difference is only three months, and Chairman Chiang and Mayor Wu are both shouldering major national missions with a rich and strong body, which is truly a rare grand event. Mayor Wu's past political achievements have already occupied a glorious page. I am waiting for the auspicious day of the summit, and I congratulate Mayor Wu on his continued efforts to open up a splendid future and create more blessings for the country and the local people. This is the unanimous wish of the people to wish people longevity and the world longevity. After the speech, Hu Xuan'an was elected as the representative to present the screen, and everyone applauded. Then Mayor Wu gave a thank-you speech, and everyone left happily at around 10:00 p.m.

### The Public Works Bureau Will Increase Property Tax

Foreign Taxpayers Will Discuss

According to the Dalu Bao, a senior official of the Public Works Bureau told a Dalu Bao reporter yesterday that recently, schools, hospitals, and other organizations have been allocating a lot of funds to the Public Works Bureau. The Public Works Bureau cannot cook without rice. The only way to deal with it is to increase the municipal tax. The municipal tax collected in the Public Concession is probably the lowest in the world. Therefore, it is expected that when the Public Works Bureau's directors hold a regular meeting next Wednesday to discuss the budget for the next fiscal year, they may propose to increase the municipal tax by 2% to 16%. If the new budget and the tax increase are passed by the directors, they will be submitted to the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers to be held next month for review. If so, there will be a debate at that time.

Flying Across the Pacific

### China's First Passenger Zhang Yuanbei Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon

Talks About How Flying Across the Pacific Was Extremely Smooth, America's Aviation is Developed, We Should Catch Up Quickly

According to Shenzhou News Agency, Zhang Yuanbei, former instructor of the Hangzhou Central Aviation School and current manager of Martin Aircraft Company, went abroad at his own expense on August 20 last year to inspect the aviation industry in the United States. He traveled all over the United States and finished his business. He flew across the Pacific Ocean to Little Luzon and transferred to the President Hoover to Shanghai. He arrived at the port at 11:30 a.m. yesterday. More than a dozen friends of Mr. Zhang and Shen Deshe of the Aviation Administration, Zhao Daosheng of the Ministry of Finance, and Zhou Peize of the Central Mint arrived at the pier to welcome him. A Shenzhou News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Zhang yesterday to talk about his inspection situation as follows:

Inspection of the Aviation Industry

According to Mr. Zhang, "I went to the United States in August last year to inspect the aviation industry. For seven months, I traveled all over the United States and made on-site inspections. I visited ten national talent training institutions in the United States, and twenty-three famous aircraft manufacturing plants and supply plants. I also met with factory owners and aviation experts to discuss the progress of the aviation industry. I deeply admire the large number of airlines in the United States and the punctuality of the aircraft's flight times. I myself spent a day in the central flight tower in New York to observe the traffic of aircraft and the situation of take-off and landing, and I felt that the management was effective. Although there are aircraft coming and going every two minutes, the order is orderly and well-organized."

### Mr. Zhang Yuanbei

Flying Across the Pacific

Mr. Zhang continued, "When I was in the United States, I flew a plane from New York to Vancouver (in Canada) in about a day. I also made many trips in the United States. The total distance I traveled in the air was about 12,000 miles in the United States. Finally, I flew across the Pacific Ocean, about 8,000 miles. I took the Pan Pacific Company's 'China Clipper' and flew from the United States to Manila. I departed on February 25 and arrived on March 3, a total of 60 hours. The altitude was about 8,500 feet to 9,000 feet. The weather was clear that day and the climate was good. The flight was extremely smooth and safe." Mr. Zhang's flight across the Pacific Ocean this time is said to be the first Chinese passenger.

Advocating Aircraft Manufacturing

Mr. Zhang said to the Shenzhou News Agency reporter at the end, "I have long wanted to go to the United States to study aviation, but I was unable to do so due to obstacles. It was not until last year that I was able to make the trip. I studied practical problems in aircraft manufacturing, pilot training, aircraft combat, and aircraft protection in the United States. Through this inspection, I deeply know the importance of the aviation industry in the international community. The past European war and the recent war in Spain can all be used as proof of the facts. I also hope that I can be of some help to the aviation industry in our country in the future. Although the aviation industry in our country is still in its infancy, as long as we continue to work hard, we will not always lag behind. The most important thing at present is to (1) assist the government with civilian power to complete aircraft manufacturing and increase people's interest in aircraft, so that they are happy to invest; (2) The United States now manufactures aircraft like manufacturing automobiles. Our country must be able to set up factories to manufacture them ourselves; (3) The government should encourage the establishment of various matching parts factories, because aircraft are all made up of matching parts. For example, there is a factory in Shanghai that makes electricity meters, which can be cited; (4) The technology of Chinese pilots is not behind compared with other countries, but the quantity is too small and must be strengthened; (5) Manufacturing aircraft is not difficult, as long as people are interested and determined, 55% of the labor is required for the completion of each aircraft. With the development of our country's handicrafts and the low wages, if we can promote the aircraft manufacturing industry, it will definitely develop. I have many feelings this time, but the most important thing is to encourage people to donate money to buy aircraft, and more importantly, to promote investment in setting up factories to manufacture aircraft ourselves."

### The Speech of the Japanese Foreign Minister Has Aroused Great Attention in Shanghai

Considered to be a Declaration with Many Points of Truth and Insight

According to the Central News Agency, the speech of the new Japanese Foreign Minister Naotake Sato on Japan's foreign policy in the House of Peers on the 8th was published by Shanghai newspapers in large characters in an important position, which aroused great attention from all walks of life. The general public believes that Foreign Minister Sato's declaration has many words of truth and insight, such as saying "The current Sino-Japanese problem can only be solved by us (Japan) changing the method and starting from a new starting point." "Everything in the past should be let go, and negotiations should be conducted from a new equal footing." These are all accurate and easy-to-see arguments, which have not been said by previous foreign ministers in recent years. As for his saying "In diplomacy, one should not forget the other party," and "Negotiations between completely independent countries should be based on equality," they are even more rational and coincide with the basic principles of our country's foreign policy. Our new Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's remarks to reporters on the 8th advocated that international relations should be based on equality and mutual benefit. What Foreign Minister Wang calls "equality" and "mutual benefit" are no different from what Foreign Minister Sato advocates "should be based on equality" and "should not forget the other party in diplomacy." The two new foreign ministers issued important declarations on the same day, and the content of the declarations is also mostly the same in its purpose, which can be said to be a coincidence. People here praised Foreign Minister Sato's correct views and deeply hope that he will overcome all difficulties and work hard based on the principles of "equality" and "not forgetting the other party" so that the relations between China and Japan can have a turning point.

### Yamamoto and Zhanbu Are Unwilling to Be Elected as New Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that the Japanese residents in Shanghai had nominated Yamamoto and Zhanbu as candidates for the new directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council last week. Both are incumbent directors, so it was widely expected that they would be re-elected. Unexpectedly, on the 5th of this month, both declared their unwillingness to be elected, without announcing the reasons. Public opinion believes that this was due to the fact that the Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily" had published several articles last week criticizing the Japanese residents' nomination system and attacking the two gentlemen. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai is currently consulting with the Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association and others to find a solution.

### Lun Chang Printing and Dyeing Factory Workers Resumed Work Voluntarily

Two Days' Wages Paid for the Strike Period; Other Conditions to Be Mediated by the Party and Government

The Dagong News Agency reports that more than 1,200 male and female workers of the British-owned Lun Jing Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, went on a full-scale strike to demand increased wages and improved treatment after being rejected by the factory.

The day before yesterday, all the workers sent 12 representatives to various agencies such as the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labour Union to petition for relief, and the strike seemed to be expanding. After hearing the news, the factory immediately invited the heads of various departments and worker representatives to negotiate again at 4:00 PM. As a result, the factory agreed to continue negotiations on the six conditions proposed by the workers. As for the wages during the workers' strike period, the factory agreed to pay for one day. All the workers agreed, as the factory's attitude had been conciliatory, so more than 1,000 night shift workers voluntarily resumed work at 5:30 PM the night before last, and the day shift workers also went to work as usual yesterday morning.

### Three Things Businessmen Should Pay Attention to After the Implementation of Income Tax (Continued)

Li Wenjie's Speech at the Civic Auditorium Offers Important Reference for the Business Community

(C) Matters Requiring Attention During Final Accounting

The final accounting is the result of accurately recording the increase or decrease of assets. The declaration and payment of income tax for profit-seeking enterprises are both done after the end of the accounting year. Therefore, the final accounting can also be said to be the most important part of the preparation work for paying income tax. Here, we should recognize two points regarding the legislative principles of the current income tax law:

㊀ The adoption of the annual taxation principle and ㊁ the strict application of the accrual basis. According to the first point, the operating losses of the previous year cannot be included in the calculations of the current year. Based on the second point, the draft guidelines for the first category of collection clearly explain the meaning of total income and actual expenses, and the methods for valuing various assets (including deferred assets) have been explained earlier. This article uses the provisions of current laws and regulations as the backbone, and will not comment on the merits and demerits of these provisions. The following describes the matters that should be paid attention to during the final accounting:

㊀ Consolidation of Accounting for Head Office and Branch Offices: Assuming that there is no separation of capital between the head office and branch offices, and the business is not completely independent, the accounts of the branch offices should be consolidated with the accounts of the head office during the final accounting to reflect their overall financial situation and operating performance. If the final accounting of the head office's accounts is limited to the assets, liabilities, and profits and losses of the head office, and the "branch office current account" is used for the funds and goods allocated to the branch offices and included in the head office's accounts, and the assets, liabilities, and profits and losses of the branch offices are not taken into account, then the final accounting statements cannot reflect the overall operating situation, and the resulting profit and loss figures will not be accurate. The basis for calculating income tax will naturally also be shaken. Therefore, when the head office handles the final accounting, it must combine the assets, liabilities, losses, and profits of the branch offices into the calculation.

㊁ Organization of Various Items of Accounts Receivable, Uncollected, Accounts Payable, Unpaid, Prepaid, and Deferred Revenue: Most industrial and commercial organizations have not adopted a new-style accounting system. When closing accounts, they often do not pay attention to the accounts that need to be organized for accounts receivable, uncollected, accounts payable, unpaid, prepaid, and deferred revenue, or they do not organize them, or even if they do, they only focus on relatively significant items. They believe that these accounts receivable and uncollected, accounts payable and unpaid, can be recorded when they are received or paid in the future. As for the prepaid and deferred revenue accounts, since there is no longer any monetary inflow or outflow relationship, there is no need to organize them. They do not know that the periodic closing of accounts is originally for the purpose of clearly understanding the operating situation and profit and loss figures of each year. Only when the profit and loss calculation within an accounting year can accurately reflect the profit and loss situation of that year can the effectiveness of accounting be brought into play. Therefore, when closing accounts, all accounts receivable and uncollected, accounts payable and unpaid must be checked and transferred, and the same applies to prepaid and deferred revenue accounts. Deferred revenue is a deferred liability and should be transferred out of revenue, and prepaid expenses are deferred assets and should be transferred out of losses. All must be calculated proportionally according to time and organized, and then the annual profit and loss calculation and the ending asset and liability situation can be accurate. Income tax is based on the accurate annual net profit as the basis for collection, which further highlights the importance of the accounting principles described in this article.

㊂ Valuation of Inventory: Article 27, Paragraph 2 of the General Rules for Chinese Merchants stipulates that the current price should be noted in the preparation of the property inventory. When the market price is higher than the original price, the original price must be recorded. The first item of the asset valuation method attached to the draft collection guidelines for the first category stipulates that the valuation of assets should be based on the original price unless otherwise specified in this method, and when the original price is higher than the market price, the market price should be the standard. Although the wording is not the same, the principle of which to take, market price or original price, is the same. In the past, industry and commerce often arbitrarily expanded or contracted the year-end inventory valuation discount. Generally, in years with generous surpluses, the inventory was depreciated to a lower value. In years with little surplus or losses, the inventory was arbitrarily valued high, and the unsold goods stored over the years were also included at a high price to reduce losses or increase profits. This approach is actually putting the cart before the horse and deceiving oneself. The current income tax law clearly stipulates the method for valuing goods, and the above-mentioned malpractices can be corrected as a result.

㊃ Depreciation of Fixed Assets: The types of fixed assets, the shortest useful life determined based on their structural conditions, and the maximum depreciation rate, and the valuation standards are all specified in great detail in the asset valuation method. Whether these regulations are reasonable and whether there are any obstacles in their application is certainly a problem. However, giving industrial and commercial organizations a unified standard so that the malpractice of arbitrary expansion and contraction in the past no longer occurs is also a commendable thing.

㊄ Elimination of Bad Debts: In theory, there are two types of methods: "comprehensive estimation method" and "individual elimination method." However, one cannot be used at the same time. The current law adopts the individual elimination method. Article 19 of the Asset Valuation Method stipulates that receivables, accounts receivable, notes receivable, and various debts, etc., may be listed as losses if one of the following circumstances occurs: ㊀ Part or all of the creditor's rights cannot be recovered due to bankruptcy, absconding, or declaration of bankruptcy, or other reasons; ㊁ The creditor's rights have been overdue for two years, and the principal or interest has not been collected after legal collection. This is the meaning of this. The intention of the law is still lenient and can remedy the freedom to estimate bad debts and expand or contract profits and losses.

㊅ Amortization of Intangible Assets: Business rights and copyrights acquired by bidding and used as assets must be fully amortized within ten years. Trademark rights, exclusive rights, and other various franchise rights, etc., are each amortized to completion according to the legally enjoyed number of years after their acquisition.

㊆ Amortization of Organizational Expenses: At least five years for the shortest period.

㊇ Deadline for Settlement Report and Tax Payment: According to the meaning of Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations and Article 26 of the Implementing Rules, the business year is from January 1 to January 31, and those who close accounts according to the lunar calendar must complete the settlement matters before the end of February. Those who use July 1 to June 30 of the following year as the business accounting year must complete the settlement before the end of July. The three months from March 1 to May 31 in the first half of the year are the declaration and tax payment period, and the period from August 1 to October 30 in the second half of the year is the declaration and tax payment period. According to the provisions of Article 33 of the Implementing Rules, the period for the competent collection authority to determine the amount of income tax is within 15 days of receiving the taxpayer's declaration. Therefore, the deadline for declaration should be 15 days earlier than the deadline for tax payment, that is, May 16 for the first half of the year and October 15 for the second half of the year.

㊈ Documents for Declaration: Fill out the Category A Report Form for Income Amount of the First Category, and submit the property inventory as a balance sheet, profit and loss statement, or other accounting documents to prove the income amount. In the property inventory, the difference between the original price and the market price of each item of property and its estimated price category should also be noted. What should be explained here is that the net income listed in the report form is completely different from the net profit listed in the profit and loss statement. The most obvious difference is the deduction of the statutory reserve fund. In addition, items that are incorrectly listed or should not be deducted must also be adjusted separately before the declaration. In various countries in Europe and the United States, in order to save time and avoid the risk of illegality, industrial and commercial organizations often entrust accountants to handle this type of adjustment work to achieve perfection. The above-mentioned points are nothing more than elaboration based on personal observation and reference to the content of laws and regulations. Income tax has been implemented. After implementation, the difficulties that we actually feel will be ten or a hundred times greater than we expected. It is hoped that the wise officials of the collection authorities can cooperate with taxpayers to overcome these inevitable difficulties. The foundation of a good income tax system and the future of its advancement will be laid here. That is what I sincerely pray for. (End)

### Train Collides with Car Yesterday Morning

At the Intersection of Qingyang Port and Xihu Highway, Car Smashed, One Westerner Seriously Injured and Died

Yesterday, the fourth upward special express train on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway left Shanghai at 8:35 a.m. It was towed by C-type locomotive No. 11 and No. 12. When it passed the Qingyang Port station and the gate of the Xihu Highway, a Willis brand small car driven by a Westerner on the highway was also speeding towards it. The car's concession registration was No. 3194, and the municipal government registration was No. 7322. The Westerner seemed to want to cross the intersection of the railway and the highway in front of the train. Unexpectedly, the train was also speeding forward at full speed. However, the horsepower of the small car was ultimately limited, and the driver still overestimated himself and rushed forward, causing it to collide violently with the second locomotive C-type No. 12 of the fourth train at the intersection. The car was thrown more than ten feet away by the locomotive and fell into the rice field west of the highway. The car body was shattered, and the Western driver's head was broken and blood splattered everywhere. The train attendants and locomotive drivers also stopped the train urgently and went to check. They saw that the Westerner was beyond help. There was a Western doctor on the train, so they asked him to give first aid, but he ultimately died due to serious injuries. Therefore, he died shortly after. The train conductor, etc., went to Kunshan Station to report and telegraphed the railway bureau for instructions. At the same time, the station dispatched a police chief to the scene of the accident to conduct an on-site investigation. Next to the deceased's body, they copied out many business cards and more than forty yuan in paper money. The business cards were printed with "G. Liebsch" and "Technical Department of Yali Foreign Company, 410 Sichuan Road, Shanghai" and other words. Therefore, they learned the deceased's surname and that he was of German nationality. Since the train was not damaged, it continued to run immediately. After receiving the report from Kunshan Station, the Kunshan County Government also sent personnel to investigate and took photos of the deceased and the destroyed car one by one. They also ordered the local security to temporarily guard the corpse and wait for the examination this morning before the family members could claim the body. They have also sent personnel to notify Yali Foreign Company to inform the deceased's family members.

### What Happened to Luo Pu?

Responsibility Lies with the Boatwoman

The No. 5 municipal ferry running the Gaoqiao Banqiao route collided with a sampan while returning to Shanghai in the evening of the 6th of this month at the Pudong Xidu Wharf due to improper turning. A ferry passenger, Kang Genfa (37 years old), a native of Pudong, who worked as a packing coolie for the Japanese-owned Iwai Yoko, fell into the river and drowned. The Customs Water Police Station did not determine who was responsible for the accident, but the two boatwomen, Wang Zhou, a native of Shandong, and Wang Han, a native of Jiangbei, were suspected of negligence in their duties, resulting in death. Yesterday, Detective Shi A Jin was sent to summon the two defendants and send them to the local court for interrogation.

Pei Gaolu抢救管

Pei Gaolu, a native of Changzhou who used to work as a coolie at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou, was watching goods at the wharf at about 7 p.m. the night before. At that time, five water pipes were unloaded from the British ship Lunqi. Because they rolled to the edge of the wharf, Pei stepped forward to rescue them, and both he and the pipes fell into the river. When others noticed, it was too late to save him. He sank without a trace. Customs Water Patrol sent Detective Yao Guofa to investigate the incident and wait for the body to be recovered before reporting for an examination.

Unstable Footing, Falls Down

Also, at 2:15 p.m. yesterday, Chen Shi, a ship repair worker from Guangdong on the British ship Behar, which was berthed at Waipu Xin in Hongkou, accidentally fell onto the No. 43 iron barge berthed next to the ship while working on the Three Calendar Scaffold. His head, arms, buttocks, and other parts were severely injured. The Customs Water Patrol detective Long Qingyun carried him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Gambling Case Cracked at the Xin Xin Hotel

Defendants Fined

Liu Ya Ying, the Chinese detective head of the Old Gate Patrol Room, learned that someone was gambling in Room 810 of the Xin Xin Hotel on Guizhou Road, profiting by taking commissions. At 11:15 p.m. the night before, he led detectives to the hotel and arrested eight gambling offenders, including Ni Shenrong, Jin Zifu, Wu Ronggen, and Jiang Xia. They seized a pair of dominoes, two dice, and thirteen yuan in paper money, and took them all to the patrol room, where they were detained separately. Also, the Chinese and Western detectives of the New Gate Patrol Room arrested eighteen gambling offenders, including Wang Zhang, Shao Rensi, Zhao A Yu, and Wang Li, at No. 5, Lane 253, Meibai Ge Road, at 11 p.m. last night. Together with a set of mahjong tiles, a set of sand flower tiles, a pair of dominoes, and the gambling money, they were taken to the patrol room and detained. Yesterday morning, they were successively sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where the patrol room lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a lawsuit according to law. After Judge Jin questioned them one by one, he ruled that each defendant should be fined separately, and the gambling equipment and gambling money should be confiscated.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Defense Committee Passes Budget Draft

Including the Volunteer Corps, Fire Department, and Police Department

The draft budget for this year's Shanghai Municipal Council's Volunteer Corps, Fire Department, and Police Department has been submitted to the Council's Board of Directors by the Council's Defense Committee for review by the Finance Committee. The main points are as follows:

㊀ Volunteer Corps

(Explanation) This year's expenditure is 88,710 yuan less than last year's. The terms of office of the adjutant and artillery instructor have expired, and it is proposed to abolish their vacancies, which can save salaries of 5,960 yuan. Uniform fees are reduced by 13,400 yuan compared to last year. It is not planned to add military equipment this year, so the purchase cost of products has been saved a lot. The transportation fee has increased by 3,000 yuan due to the addition of vehicles. The expenditure of the Russian team will be reduced by 15,680 yuan due to the salary schedule agreed upon, which will take effect from July 10 this year. A special expenditure item includes the cost of purchasing two trucks, totaling 6,800 yuan. According to the opinion of the Finance Director, the budget has been reduced as much as possible, so there is no room for further savings in various expenditures.

㊁ Fire Department

(A) Special Expenditure: The expenditure required for the new central fire brigade is estimated at 1,000,000 yuan, and the expenditure for the new branch offices in various districts is estimated at 1,200,000 yuan, all of which have been eliminated. The expenditure required for the expansion project of the machine room of the Hongkou branch and the remainder of the expenditure required for the temporary branch on Henan Road are both allowed to be included in the special expenditure item.

(B) Recurring expenditure, excluding the cost of purchasing materials and supplies and the expenditure required for ambulances, totals 506,40 yuan, saving 34,350 yuan compared to last year. It is planned to purchase two vehicles for transporting patients to hospitals, so the funding for the ambulance section has increased by 13,230 yuan.

㊂ Police Department

(Explanation) This year's expenditure is 162,240 yuan less than last year's. The reason is the implementation of the newly revised salary schedule, temporarily reducing the number of police officers, and saving various other expenditures. After the Police Department handled the affairs of the former Rickshaw Committee, the required expenditure has been included in the budget. The quota for patrolmen and probationary patrolmen was originally 313, but it is planned to temporarily use 283 this year. The rickshaw management section added one vehicle inspector, the reserve team added 16 Russian police officers (transferred from the Russian team of the Volunteer Corps), two drivers, 20 Japanese police officers, and the expenditure required for the promotion of the Chinese assistant patrol chief to inspector has also been included in the budget. The expenditure for the prisons and reformatories has decreased by 5,920 yuan compared to last year. The expenditure required for hiring a Chinese assistant warden and adding two teachers has been included in the budget. The expenditure for the special patrol section (including the purchase cost of materials and supplies) totals 30,680 yuan.

### Apprentice Bravely Fights Robbers

A Packet of Subsidiary Coins Preserved, Robber Shoots and Injures His Left Leg

Sun Xiuting, a native of Zhenjiang, 19 years old, is now an apprentice at the Baoxiang Money Shop at No. 23 Tianzhutang Street, French Concession. Although Sun is young, he is naturally alert, which is why he is valued by the colleagues in the shop. At 5:30 a.m. yesterday, Sun was ordered by Qiu Deru (a native of Suzhou), the shop's accountant, to carry 200 yuan in legal tender to the Xinjingxiang Money Shop in Nandongmen, Nanshi, to exchange for nickel coins and subsidiary coins for door-to-door exchange. Sun went to Dadongmen and completed the procedures. After wrapping the exchanged subsidiary coins of various kinds in newspaper, he clamped them under his arm. When he walked to the entrance of the Sunjia Lane on Zhonghua Road, Taidongmen, three robbers suddenly jumped out from the roadside. One robber wearing a felt hat blocked the way with a gun, aimed at Sun's chest, and forbade him to make a sound. At the same time, one robber intended to snatch the paper bag that Sun was holding. Sun immediately resisted with his arm and shouted for help. Knowing that things were not good, and in order to escape, the robbers shot at Sun's lower body. The bullet hit Sun's left leg and pierced through. He fell to the ground in extreme pain. The three robbers took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The police officer at Post No. 15 nearby reported to the Yemiao Police Station. Chief Yu immediately led a large number of police officers to the scene. He first sent Sun to the Nanyang Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury was not serious. Chief Yu ordered his subordinates and Dong Mingde, the captain of the Fifth Detachment of the Investigation Team, to investigate the murderer and bring him to justice.

### Two Robbery Cases

Labu Road: Yesterday morning, three robbers came to the room at No. on Labu Road, French Concession. One robber held a pistol and forbade them to make a sound. As a result, more than 100 yuan in national currency was robbed, and the robbers escaped with the loot. Afterwards, the victim issued a loss report to the patrol room and asked them to arrest the robbers.

Xingsheng Street: At 8:30 p.m. last night, six robbers suddenly came to the overshoe shop at No. 90 Xingsheng Street, French Concession. Three robbers with guns entered the shop and forbade everyone to make a sound. They robbed all the more than 100 yuan sold in the counter. After obtaining the loot, they went out and fled separately. Then the shop owner, Kai Ming, issued a loss report to the Dazimingzhong Patrol Room and requested to pursue the robbers.

### Sun Shaoqing Indiscriminately Engages in Litigation; Patrol Room Adds Two Charges

One Case is Yao Yuebo, One Case is Pan Xueyan. There is Also Zhou Xiangyun Case Handled by Sun. Court Interrogation Yesterday Ordered Prohibition of Audience

Sun Shaoqing, a native of Tongzhou, was suspected of indiscriminately engaging in litigation, intimidation, and defrauding money. He was arrested by the Public Patrol Room's Chinese Inspector Lu Liankui and Detective Liu Shaokui and sent to the First Special District Court. He was prosecuted according to Articles 157 and 346 of the Criminal Law for indiscriminately engaging in the Sun Wu Guizhen and Wu Dengying property division case and obtaining 40,000 yuan. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, this case was continued to be heard in the First Criminal Court by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court. An order was issued to

Prohibit Audience

First, the patrol room lawyer Ru Baoyi claimed that, in addition to the case that had already been prosecuted last time, two more cases were added today. ㊀ Yao Yuebo (owner of Yao Renxing Construction Factory), a native of Nantong, and his brother Yao Renyi (owner of Yao Shunxing Construction Factory) jointly contracted a project. Later, Yao Renyi died, and his son Yao Zhichun inherited all the business. In the 30th year, Yao Yuebo settled the project account with his nephew and ordered him to pay 10,000 yuan in rights. Because Yao Zhichun refused, he entrusted the defendant Sun Shaoqing to negotiate. After Sun turned to

Entrust Zhu Nanshan

Doctor to mediate, the result was a settlement of 5,000 yuan, but Yao Yuebo actually only got 1,500 yuan. ㊁ The famous actress Pan Xueyan (currently living in Tongfuli, Julai Road, with Zheng Yongquan, a senior employee of Citibank), in November of the 24th year, had entrusted the defendant Sun Shaoqing to extort 20,000 yuan from Xu Maochang (owner of Dafeng Yarn Factory, brother of Xu Maotang, comprador of the Bank of England). Later, Xu entrusted lawyer Wu Linkun to

19,000

Yuan as the price to settle the case, and Pan got very little. Today, the witnesses Yao Yuebo and the two lawyers Wu Linkun and Gu Gongbing are all in court, but lawyer Chen Tingrui cannot attend due to illness. Then, Yao Yuebo's confession was presented to the court. The court immediately summoned Wu Shenbo, the son of Wu Dengying, to the case, saying that the court had inquired to your representative lawyer Chen Tingrui, who claimed that before the case was over, you had received threatening phone calls and someone

Following Your

Car, but Wu absolutely denied it. At that time, Sun Shaoqing's wife Sun Zhu was in court. After the court summoned her to the case and questioned her, she asked whether she knew that Wu Yuee had sued Zhou Xiangyun, which was handled by her husband and settled for 70,000 yuan. According to her answer, Wu Yuee had lived with her before. She had testified in court at Wu's request, but she did not know anything else. The court asked whether the case had been investigated by the court and was jointly handled by her and the deceased Tang Jiapeng. She also replied that she did not know. The patrol room lawyer Ru Baoyi immediately stated that she had

Accomplice Suspicion

The patrol room must investigate it. Then Qian Judge summoned lawyer Wu Linkun to the case. According to his testimony, on a certain day in November of the 24th year, Xu Maochang went to the back of No. 67 Fuming Village, Fuxu Road, and said that he had met Pan Xueyan because they met while watching a play or had the same dining words left in Pan's hand, causing Pan to use this as evidence that he had a relationship with him, and he needed 20,000 yuan. Now Sun Shaoqing and Cai Futang have mediated a settlement, but one must establish a

Never End Entanglements

Certificate, explaining that it has nothing to do with Pan and recalling the note. This lawyer often drafted it on his behalf. Later, because he wanted to hand over the money, on a certain day, Sun Shaoqing, Cai Futang, Pan Hongsheng, and others came to this lawyer's place and insisted that Pan must come in person before the money could be handed over. Therefore, Sun and Pan Hongsheng fought each other in this lawyer's house. After being stopped, they stopped. Afterwards, after Pan Xueyan and Sun and others came together, they finally made a statement and handed over 10,000 yuan to settle the case. Sun Shaoqing and Cai Futang are co-mediators on the certificate. Today, Xu Mao

Is in Hangzhou

Because of an accident, he could not attend the meeting and has commissioned accountant Lu Yifang to attend the meeting on his behalf. Qian Judge then questioned Lu, saying that Xu would not be able to attend the meeting until a week later. In short, Sun Shaoqing completely denied this case, saying that he had not handled the case. Qian Judge then summoned Yao Yuebo to the court. According to his confession, because my nephew did not want to give me the rights that I deserved, I was so angry that I spoke with the building owner Yin Xiangfa in the Dongxinger Tea House on Broadway and asked Yin to introduce Sun Shaoqing to handle it.

Four-Six Split

The mountain Jiang Zhaozhou wrote a contract. As a result, it was settled for 5,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, Sun only gave me 1,500 yuan, and the rest was swallowed up. There was nothing I could do. As for Sun Wu, I did introduce her. She lived in Sun's house for about a year. Sun initially demanded 200,000 yuan, then reduced it to 120,000, 70,000, and finally settled for 40,000 yuan. Sun only gave Sun Wu 11,500 yuan, and gave me 500 yuan for rewards and travel expenses. I heard Sun say that he had

On Sichuan Road

Followed Wu Dengying's car and so on. Then, lawyer Gu Gongbing proved that Sun Wu's case was handled by Sun Shaoqing four or five days before the settlement. When the money was handed over at lawyer Chen Tingrui's office, Sun was also in the room. At that time, the other party's lawyer Chen handed the bank note to me, and I handed it over to Sun Wu. I don't know what happened after that. Qian Judge asked him about the incident, and Sun still denied it from beginning to end. The court then announced that the case would be adjourned for one week for further interrogation.

Far East Sales Account for 25 Percent

According to the Zilin Daily, yesterday, Mr. Parker, the general manager of the American Parker Pen Company, told the Zilin Daily representative that the pens manufactured by the company and sold in the Far East account for about 25 percent of the total.

He is scheduled to return home on the President Hoover tomorrow.

### Telegram of Congratulations from the National Medicine and Pharmaceutical Industry to the Chinese Medicine Committee on Taking Office

The members of the Chinese Medicine Committee of the Ministry of Health are scheduled to hold an inauguration ceremony on the 10th. The Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association sent a telegram yesterday to congratulate the committee members, saying: "Spring fills the apricot grove, fame spreads throughout the land. Excellence in scholarship leads to official appointment, with unanimous support in the capital. In charge of medical administration, upholding its established goals. Healing people and the country, pioneering new initiatives. This special telegram expresses our heartfelt wishes, respectfully congratulating you on your appointment."

### Turning Soil into Gold

A Fraud Case Involving Chemical Reactions in Medicinal Liquids Awaits Trial Conclusion

Bydalinko, a 46-year-old White Russian, resided at No. 304 Myers Avenue, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. He previously operated a metal jewelry store on Rue du Pere Froc. Last October, he and his translator, Li Bingzhong (a 45-year-old from Zhenjiang), went to Fuzhou to open a jewelry store. They agreed with Li Jinde, a Taiwanese man (who was a detective at the local Public Security Bureau), that Bydalinko would entrust him with selling eight and a half taels of 14-karat foreign gold. Li did not sell it. Later, Li Bingzhong sold it himself to Chen Aqian and a Ms. Lin, obtaining 968 national currency. However, the buyers later discovered that the foreign gold was made from soil as the raw material, transformed into metal through the chemical action of a certain medicinal liquid. However, it could only deceive for a short time; after a long time, it would revert to soil. They reported this to the local Public Security Bureau. Since Bydalinko and others had already returned to Shanghai by boat, an urgent telegram was sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, Bydalinko and Li Bingzhong were intercepted and transferred to the local court. Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang investigated and received confirmation from the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau that the gold bar was indeed counterfeit. The defendants confessed that they could earn 50 yuan from each yuan, so they were prosecuted for fraud. Yesterday, Judge Lu Hongze opened the court and questioned the defendants, who claimed that the gold was not counterfeit and that Li Jinde, unhappy with the 100 yuan introduction commission he received, designed a scheme to frame them. They hired a lawyer to defend them. The judge announced the end of the debate, and the verdict will be announced on the 13th. The defendants requested to be released on bail, which the judge granted after each paid a deposit of 1,000 yuan.

### Russian Sets Up Gambling Den, Investigation Completed

Public Prosecution Initiated

Victor Ackmen, a Russian national, secretly established a large gambling den at No. 1409 Yu Yuan Road, Wanguo Coffee Shop. The police raided it at 11:00 PM on February 10th of this year. Because it was located on an extraterritorial road, it was transferred to the local court's prosecutor's office. Victor Ackmen paid a cash bail of 1,000 yuan to await investigation. It has now been found that those gambling inside at the time included Ala Navitongji (a journalist), Shapiro (a salesman), Guo Qiubi (a broker), Burke (a musician), Bairanasi (a salesman), and Yin Xiang Luoweiski (unemployed). Since they were fortunately released on bail at the First Special District Court, they should all be managed by the local court according to the law. Prosecutor Ma held a court session in the afternoon and, after questioning them, each paid a deposit of 500 yuan to await verification. The investigation has been completed and public prosecution will be initiated immediately.

### Murder in Broad Daylight

Song Amao Dies from Five Knife Wounds

Yesterday at around 2:00 PM, at the intersection of Shandong Road and Guangdong Road, a man named Song Amao, 34 years old, was stabbed with a knife, suffering one wound to his right leg, one wound each to the left and right sides of his face, and two wounds to his chest. He also had one wound to each arm, and was bleeding profusely. His injuries were severe, and he barely had any breath left. Seeing the severity of the crime, the assailants fled into the alleyways without a trace. After the assault, a Chinese police officer from No. 2637 was called to the scene and transported the victim to Renji Hospital. However, he died shortly after, despite medical treatment. It is rumored that the deceased was not a virtuous man, as his chest and arms were tattooed with patterns.

### Hygiene Testing Laboratory Officially Opens on a Set Date

Next Month, the Third

The Shanghai Hygiene Testing Laboratory, after selecting a site in the city center and constructing a new building, has now been completed. The internal layout has also been finalized and it will officially open next month on the third. The laboratory is China's only hygiene testing organization, built with precision and equipped perfectly. It is of great importance to hygiene work. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited the laboratory director, Cheng Shuzhen, yesterday, and was guided to visit each room. The laboratory is a three-story, west-facing Western-style building with more than twenty rooms. Besides a part used for office space, most are used for testing. Roughly speaking, it can be divided into two parts: inspection and manufacturing. Currently, the laboratory is rushing to produce smallpox vaccines and meningitis prevention shots, due to the need for these in time. The smallpox vaccines produced by the laboratory have almost been distributed across the country, so manufacturing is extremely busy. The smallpox vaccines are thoroughly inspected and then put into glass tubes, each tube for five people. The tubes are filled by machine, filling three to four thousand tubes every ten minutes. Various infectious disease bacteria are classified and placed in glass tubes, using beef broth, sheep blood, agar, etc., for various bacteria. Then, the bacteria are processed into prevention shots through a certain procedure for various hospitals. Regarding the inspection part, there are blood and urine samples sent by various hospitals for testing. Tap water from Zhabei and Huhangnan, as well as milk, soda, various fruit juices, and various drugs sold in the city, are inspected. Recently, the laboratory has been busy inspecting the urine of smokers sent by various smoking cessation hospitals.

### Shanghai Grand Theater Loss: Italian Consulate Agrees to Compensation

According to the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun," the incident of Italian sailors vandalizing the Russian-operated Shanghai Grand Theater has caused a major international issue.

Therefore, the outcome of the issue has attracted attention from all parties. It is now heard that the Italian Consul General is willing to pay compensation. The Russian Consul General is among those who advocate a hard line, as this violent act occurred when a film that had been inspected by the Chinese government was being shown in the Chinese quarter, proving that it was undoubtedly planned.

### Rickshaw Puller Conspires to Kidnap Young Master, Police Initiate Public Prosecution

Police Report the Investigation Process, Chen Shoupeng Released First as He Was Not Involved

Yang Rongfu, the owner of Dachang Porcelain Shop at No. 130 Kai Zi Er Road, French Concession, from Wuxi, had his six-year-old son Huiqi kidnapped by his hired rickshaw puller Cai Fuxing, who conspired with others to hide him, and then sent a letter demanding 5,000 yuan for ransom. He also sent a party member, Wu Jinshu, to contact the victim's family with the shoes worn by Huiqi, and agreed on a price of 1,000 yuan. Yang prepared the money and went to the agreed location, but no one from the gang came to collect the money and hand over the ticket. The incident was leaked, and Cheng Yunyu, a tailor from Wuxi who lived near the Eight Immortals Bridge, used the name of the kidnapper to send a letter to Yang Rongfu, asking him to prepare 3,000 yuan to contact the ransom ticket at the Xinxin Hotel, in order to defraud money. Yang Rongfu was afraid of being defrauded again, and reported the information to the French police, who sent a detective in disguise to the Xinxin Hotel and arrested Zhang Yunyu. They then started investigating and arrested the line robbers Cai Fuxing, Wu Jinshu, Shi Dehong, and the suspect Chen Shoupeng, and sent them to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation and investigation. The gang then sent the ticket Huiqi home safely. All the details have been reported in previous newspapers. The French police have now completed the investigation of the case. Yesterday, the defendants were escorted to the Special No. 2 Court, where Judge Chen Shuoying heard the case in the first criminal court. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the police department, stated the case, saying that Yang Rongfu's son Huiqi was kidnapped on January 27. The first defendant, Cai Fuxing, the rickshaw puller used by the victim, secretly discussed with the gang members Wu Jinshu and Shi Dehong, and the fugitive Gao Jinshi and Zhang Zhenyi, at the Tiger Stove across from Fuxingli. On January 27, Yang Rongfu went to Nanjing for business, and Cai Fuxing sent him to the North Station. Cai believed that the opportunity had arrived, so he kidnapped Huiqi and sent him to the boat. The ransom price was 5,000 yuan, but was finally negotiated for 1,000 yuan. Wu Jinshu was entrusted to carry Huiqi's shoes to show trust. Later, Zhang Yunyu sent a letter to Yang demanding ransom. The police received the report from the victim and were able to solve the case. After full investigation, Chen Shoupeng was found to be unrelated to the case and will not be prosecuted. He requested that he be released first. The four defendants Cai Fuxing, Wu Jinshu, Shi Dehong, and Zhang Yunyu were prosecuted according to Article 264 and Lu 136 of the Criminal Law for kidnapping and extorting money and fraud. He requested that they be interrogated and dealt with according to the law. The court inquired and questioned the defendants, and then announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the morning of the 16th, and the plaintiff would be summoned to court for further questioning. Chen Shoupeng was released, and the other defendants were sent back to custody.

Spring and Autumn

### Work

— (Yan Chonglou)

Work is life.

Today's achievements are the result of yesterday's hard work; today's poverty is the result of yesterday's leisure!

Where there is work, there is survival.

People cannot endure forced labor, so they must be able to work automatically.

Leisure is not necessarily happiness, and work is not necessarily pain.

You can tell that a person who labors tirelessly for work all day long is definitely an excellent member.

Doing more work can eliminate delusions.

After doing a difficult job, you will find that the job is not very difficult.

If today's work is not finished, it will take up the place of tomorrow's work!

Working alone in a team of workers is as uncomfortable as laboring alone in a group of idlers.

No matter what kind of system society becomes, people cannot be without work.

### Ba'an Situ Temple

— Fang Zheng

Everyone knows that Nanjing Road in Shanghai is the most prosperous long road. At the same time, because it is too materially civilized, it is also known as the Great Road, saying that it is the first road in Shanghai. But civilization is civilization, but there is an 18th-century superstitious thing there! What do you say? It is the Ba'an Situ Temple (commonly known as Rainbow Temple) recorded in this article.

I have been in Shanghai for a long time, but I have never visited it. The reason is that there are many things in Shanghai that have a name but no reality. Therefore, even if I pass by its door, I have never paid attention to it.

Yesterday I was bored, so I went to Nanjing Road to run around, which made me pay attention to Ba'an Situ Temple. After discussing it with my companions, I finally ran in and visited for more than ten minutes.

This temple is originally next to the Taikang Food Company, with a one-room facade. There are five golden characters on the door plaque: "Ba'an Situ Temple". Stepping over the threshold, you will find vendors selling Buddhist beads, Buddhist books, and supplies for seeking gods and chanting scriptures. On both sides are plaques with the words "Every wish is fulfilled", which were all donated by believers. In the center stands an unknown statue of a god, standing tall and majestic. Further inside is the main hall. Perhaps the incense is too strong? It makes people unable to open their eyes when they go in, and the people who burn incense and worship are very crowded; there are also many women who sell their bodies and sell their personality, also holding incense and kneeling very piously. It is said that the business is better after worshiping. I can't help but laugh secretly. The divine way teaches people to pay attention to sex, then isn't that god not righteous? This may be the mystery of what they call "Every wish is fulfilled"?

Turning into the left wing is a fortune-telling and divination bodhisattva who helps people match marriages by dismantling characters. Wearing black glasses, wearing a blue robe, and a meta-colored mandarin jacket, he sits upright, with a table in front of him, and an incense burner on the table, with an incense stick in it, and it is lit! Is it a god? Is it a person? I really can't tell. So I ran out dubiously.

Back on the road, the scene in front of me seemed to have changed to: "Why is superstition so rampant in China?" My companion asked me. I seemed speechless and could only smile bitterly at him.

### The Phoenix Changes Its Nest

When he went out the door with his book bag, Xiao Ju also followed him to the outside of the gate, holding the door frame and standing on the stone door frame looking at his back. After he walked a few steps, she gently called out "Miss". Meng Lan turned around and asked him what was the matter. Xiao Ju smiled and said nothing was the matter. Meng Lan said: "You little thing, you're making fun of me. What did you call me for?" After speaking, she walked forward. Xiao Ju followed behind, chasing a few steps, and smiled and called out: "Miss, I have something to tell you." Meng Lan said: "If you have something to say, just say it, what are you doing acting so sneaky." Then she stopped and turned around to look at him and said: "What do you want to say, just say it." Xiao Ju pressed a finger to her lips, slightly raising her head, looking at his face. She said: "If I tell Miss, you will be even more worried." Meng Lan smiled and said: "If you're afraid of me being worried, then you don't have to tell me." Xiao Ju turned around, touched the end of her braid, and drew on the ground with her feet and said: "Miss treats me very well, if I don't say it, my conscience will not let me." These words aroused Meng Lan's attention, so she stood still and did not move, looking at him and said: "Tell me, what is so important. You always know my character, I will definitely not say that you told me." Xiao Ju looked back at her own door, took a step closer, leaned against Meng Lan, and whispered: "Miss's happy day has been chosen, it's September 24th. Master's intention was to tell you long ago. Madam said that she had told Miss long ago, she would be naughty long ago. It's better to tell Miss when the day is right in front of her. I feel very sad for Miss in my heart, how can such a big thing not be told to you? But I am also timid and dare not speak up. Because last night the second young mistress spoke to you and has already told you half of it. So I just told you the other half." Hearing this, Meng Lan was stunned for a moment, and then said: "Why didn't you tell me beforehand?" Xiao Ju said: "How dare I say it beforehand? The whole family didn't mention a word." Meng Lan nodded and said: "Okay, I know, you go back." After he finished saying these words, he sighed slightly, turned around, and walked step by step towards the school road. He was originally a person with a furrowed brow, and after this conversation, a layer of melancholy was added to that delicate face. When he went, he was thinking about his thoughts and walked step by step looking at the ground. When he came back from school, he still measured the ground and walked back step by step. However, on the way, he looked up to the front from time to time. It seemed that something was feeling in the dark. When he looked up to the front, Zhang Guoqi appeared in this posture of him. Usually when the two meet, Meng Lan always pretends to be ignorant and passes by. At most, he glances at Guoqi, and in that glimpse of the eye, he represents hundreds of millions of words. (143)

Famous People's Anecdotes

### Anecdotes of the World's Four Giants (Part 1)

— Chao Xi

Three, Mussolini, the manufacturer of Macaroni

The face of the terrible Mussolini of Italy is definitely not as terrible as the photos that are often seen in the news. In fact, his often appearing smile often makes those who have met him deny that the dictator has the stern face shown in the publicly photographed photos. And Mussolini's voice is extremely pleasant to hear, so some people even want to say that if this Mussolini did not aspire to the boring business of so-called politicians, but concentrated on the cultivation of singing, he would become a successor to the musician Caruso.

This powerful Fascist commander is now devoting his enthusiasm and energy to promoting his views to the public, but in the past he was a figure who advocated socialism. He is indeed a possessor of a dual personality. Mussolini, who often puts on a solemn face in front of the audience or when talking to important people, is clearly very different from him when he indulges in food and drink at home. This is inevitably excessive.

He likes to eat macaroni with homemade sauce the most. Next to his dining table, there is often a specially made steamer and a small pot containing sauce. When his servant picks up the macaroni from the steamer and respectfully presents it to him, he moves his proud nose, takes some of his family's traditional sauce with a wooden spoon to add flavor to it. After doing this, his servant brings the macaroni to the guest. It is said that a warrior who was hated by Mussolini once rejected the macaroni made by the dictator himself, so he was exiled to an island in the Mediterranean Sea.

Four, the Eloquent Hitler

Hitler, the leader of the National Socialist Party who burned books, exiled Jews, and used extremely oppressive political means, was originally just a soldier nineteen years ago. His full body still contains the spirit of that time. Recently, he often wears a collarless morning suit, just like an athlete. He is trying to show his leisurely attitude, but he still wants to find American journalists to confront: "What I personally hate the most is so-called criticism, which only makes the problem more complicated. Now Germany is in a very difficult period. In the fourteen years since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, 224,000 Germans have committed suicide. Isn't that four people committing suicide a day? Germany did not even have more than 60,000 people killed in the war with France in 1870?..." (Interview with journalists in 1933) This is simply using a speech tone even when speaking alone, and he is indeed worthy of being an eloquent debater.

### Sai Jinhua's Burial Site, Taoranting

— Chen Xiaokan

After the death of Sai Jinhua, a heroine of her generation, in Peiping, her funeral was desolate, and her family was almost unable to bury her. Fortunately, some philanthropists recalled Sai's merits in running for the country in those years, and everyone generously donated money to bury her next to Taoranting on the southern outskirts of the city. If Sai knew, she should die without regret.

It is said that Taoranting was built by Jiang Zao, a doctor of the Qing Dynasty, with his own funds. The foundation of the pavilion is very high, with winding corridors and rooms, from which you can see the scenery of Peiping from afar.

However, this is all suburban scenery, and it is very desolate and lonely; therefore, when people on the edge of the city get tired of their lives and die, they always move to that place to make a place of return. "Only thousands of graves are seen in Beiman" is right here!

However, the cemeteries in the four suburbs of Peiping are not as few as in our inland areas; why do you let "Taoranting" become famous alone? This also has a literary origin. In the dense mounds of barren tombs, you can find some parallel four and six beautiful and sad sentences.

Let's first take the Fragrant Tomb as an example:—This is a desolate ancient tomb overgrown with weeds and has become a fox den and rat hole. The descendants are scattered, the barley rice has been empty for a long time, and the broken stele and broken monument have been messed up. However, on that gray-black stone tablet, you can still vaguely identify some wonderful texts:

"Vast sorrow, vast calamity! The short song ends, the bright moon is missing, the lush city of beautiful people, there is blue blood in it, the blood will sometimes run out, the moon will sometimes disappear, a wisp of fragrant soul will never be cut off! Is it or is it not? Transform into a butterfly!"

There is also a seven-character quatrain, which is also quite readable, and the text says:

"The fluttering wind and rain are pitiful, the fragrant dreams are hazy and full of green Ting: the fallen peaches are exhausted and the plums are strong, it is unbearable to reread the inscription for burying flowers."

What kind of person is buried in this ancient tomb after all? We don't know. According to the locals there: it is the burial place of Qian Yun, a famous prostitute from the past; but some say that it is the secret tomb of Concubine Xiang of that year. Everyone has different opinions, and no one can be sure. ——Just twenty years away from Xiang Tomb, there is also a Parrot Tomb, which also has an inscription:

"Literature is the source of misfortune: wisdom is the source of misfortune, alas, writing fu hurts Zheng Ping."

It is said that this tomb is the place where a famous writer in a certain era burned his manuscripts. He suffered a major stimulation and had nowhere to vent his hatred. He hated it and burned all the manuscripts, burying the ashes underground. What a pity!

Sai Jinhua's life deeds are worth singing and crying: both sad and beautiful, compared to the aunt who just uses her beauty to win people's love, her personality is a hundred times higher, and it is simply incomparable! Now that she is buried in this place, that is the best it can be.

——The seven-character quatrain eulogy on the "Fragrant Tomb" can also be transferred to Sai!....

Talking Points

### Ambassador Xu's Luck

— Me

The other day, the newly appointed Japanese Foreign Minister, Sato Naotake, met with the diplomatic corps and spoke with the ambassadors for a short time. However, he spoke with Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, for a long time. This was because Ambassador Xu was about to return to China. On the 6th, Xu Shiying left Beijing and set off for home. The Japanese side also held a grand farewell party to express their goodwill. Exchanges between envoys are related to international etiquette, and there should naturally be expressions of welcome and farewell. However, the Japanese side's enthusiastic hospitality this time was truly rare.

Sato also expressed to Ambassador Xu that he had always believed in the necessity of peace between China and Japan and would strive to realize this long-held view in the future. He had long admired Ambassador Liangqing Xu's personality and hoped that Ambassador Xu could return to his post soon and make contributions to Sino-Japanese relations together. Ambassador Xu must have been flattered by this expression of goodwill and sweet tone.

The other side is now shouting the slogan of economic cooperation. It seems that the weapons of war between China and Japan are about to turn into silk and jade, and the ominous and inharmonious atmosphere is changing. Therefore, there are even more far-reaching expectations for Xu's return this time, so the hospitality is also extraordinarily thoughtful. Xu was fortunate enough to witness this grand occasion, which was perhaps beyond his original wishes. However, although Xu is the ambassador to Japan, the diplomatic policy must adhere to the intentions of the central authorities and cannot be freely dealt with. However, Ambassador Xu's responsibility is to assist the government where it falls short on one hand, and to directly negotiate with the Japanese side on the other hand. His important position is self-evident. Therefore, Xu's receipt of this generous treatment is also due to his position and prestige.

However, while the other side is calling for economic cooperation, so-called economic survey teams are coming to China in batches to conduct on-the-ground surveys. On the other hand, they are greatly increasing their troops in North China and conducting large-scale exercises, completely intending to control and occupy by force. This kind of two-faced action is the same as saying that the other side's diplomacy is dualistic, or even that it is a coordinated unity that responds internally and externally. Under these circumstances, who really believes that there is a possibility of friendship?

Although our country is the only peace-loving country in the world, we will never allow ourselves to be deceived or played with under this two-pronged oppression. We will never turn a deaf ear to it, never rub against it, and once it becomes a fait accompli, it will be even more difficult to discuss with them. Ambassador Xu is stationed in their country, and his understanding of the internal situation of their country and the observations of the outside world must be deeper. He will definitely have high and great opinions to contribute to the government, and he will never be satisfied because of international etiquette and consider it a sign of friendship between the two countries.

In private exchanges, if someone suddenly becomes intimate with you for no reason, or becomes cold for no reason, then you must investigate the reason between their coldness and intimacy and understand the truth before you can deal with them. Otherwise, you will be deceived, and it will be too late to regret it. Moreover, Ambassador Xu shoulders the heavy responsibility of the country, and the country relies on Ambassador Xu to deal with and negotiate. The importance of his relationship is self-evident. I deeply hope that Ambassador Xu can truly understand the situation on the other side.

### Welcoming Chen Bo'er and Others

— Xiao Mei

Ms. Chen Bo'er, representative of the "Shanghai Women and Children's Suiyuan Front Comfort Group," and others have returned. Simultaneously appearing in the newspapers are numerous articles commemorating March 8th (International Women's Day). The arguments in these articles are mostly correct, demanding national and personal liberation, and seeking to become "upright individuals" equal to men in a free world.

In politics and law, Chinese women are equal to women in other countries and equal to men. But what about in education? Although the law stipulates that men and women have the right to equal education, the number of so-called intellectual women graduating from universities, and even returning from studying abroad, is not small in China today. However, if we broaden our perspective, how many women are backward, toiling like beasts of burden their whole lives, and unaware of what education is? Due to economic dependence, what is the difference between educated and properly educated women compared to men?

Many sages have said that "women are doubly enslaved," which is not an exaggeration. Generally, women, like ordinary male laborers, are subordinates. In gender relations, in this male-centered society, they are also slaves. And in this "ancient country of the East," China, the remnants of feudalism have not died out, and the insults and damages they suffer exceed those of other so-called civilized countries.

The experiences of Chen Bo'er and her group in going north to comfort the troops provide a good example.

It is said that when Chen Bo'er and her group first went north to comfort the troops, they were treated very favorably by all parties. The reason for this favorable treatment is ridiculous: because Chen Bo'er is a movie star. In the minds of many, movie stars are not much different from social butterflies. Therefore, the so-called troop comforting was largely a pretext. But unexpectedly, upon meeting them, they found no seductive adornments or frivolous behavior. And after arriving in Suiyuan, they even unexpectedly performed several plays that could not be performed in the interior. In this way, the notion that movie stars are playthings for accompanying people to restaurants, eating, and dancing was indeed shattered by facts. And the "favorable treatment" that followed, the inability to perform, and the various threats, were originally "deserved."

Chen Bo'er and others are relatively well-placed, awakened intellectuals in society. Their "national duty," which they performed to comfort themselves, encountered such obstacles and misinterpretations. What kind of insults and damages will other women, living in darkness and toiling endlessly, suffer?

The reason for being "obstructed" may perhaps be explained as "weak nation": (but we do not understand why even a "weak nation" cannot fulfill the national duty of its citizens!) But what is the reason for being misinterpreted?

To break through "obstruction," we must proceed with the goal of seeking national liberation. And to avoid being misinterpreted and insulted, we must not only use facts to silence those slanderous mouths and hearts, but also seek a comprehensive solution to the problem of economic dependence.

If women's economic rights cannot be established independently, then women will be slaves to men for life, and being misinterpreted is a small matter.

### Sai Jinhua (2)

— Chen He

Sai Jinhua mingled with Jin Yunxian on various flower boats for more than just a day, and the news finally reached her grandmother's ears. In her sacred concept of chastity, such a spectacle of accompanying people to drink and providing entertainment was not allowed. "But what can be done in this social system! It's economic oppression!" After Sai Zhou's repeated persuasion, following the tide, Sai Jinhua became a prostitute from then on.

### A French Female Journalist Describes the Scenery of Madrid

— Te

I arrived in Madrid at this time, which can be considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The streets in the city were full of garbage because no street cleaners were working; the chairs in the park were all scattered and lying on the ground; the shops were all closed, some with broken glass windows, some with signs removed, and some with iron sheds collapsed, blocking the doors, so people had to bend down and crawl to get in and out. The clocks had all stopped, and the post office had been burned inside, but the magnificent exterior still remained. The key points on all sides were blocked with mailbags, but I don't know if the bags contained family letters that had never been delivered and that people were eagerly waiting for. One newspaper office had a barrier made of unsold newspapers in front of the door, with a few pots of holly trees arranged on top, like those seen in front of Parisian taverns. Strong men had to undergo military training for half a day every day, so food stores only opened in the morning, and customers waited in rows. Some shops opened in the afternoon. One exquisite shop, specializing in foreign-imported men's clothing, was still selling its stock, and the customers were mostly officers. The shops next door had been completely destroyed, but it stood alone, probably relying on the French or other flags it hung. The most useful luxury goods in the store were exquisite dinnerware and similar items, which are still left now because no one cares about them. The opportunistic transactions were all hawked along the street, and some of them were Chinese, selling items needed by soldiers, such as portable knives, shaving supplies, felt hats, cheap gems, and fake beads. I don't know where these things came from or how they could be transported to Madrid. Some of the vendors set up stalls on the sidewalks of "Gran Vía" or spread out their wares for sale next to the huge craters formed by artillery shells in "Puerta del Sol." Because there were many bomb craters on the ground, the trams were very careful when passing by. I saw a woman feeding sheep on a green shrub field. Life in the city was chaotic and disordered. The once magnificent residences were now full of beggars and refugees who had fled from all the war-torn areas, and some had even built reed sheds inside, planning to stay for a long time. The soldiers were very generous to them, which shows that even in the midst of indiscriminate killing, people's charitable hearts have not been extinguished. Several cafes decorated in a new style were very expensive, but they were full after they opened in the afternoon. The customers were all soldiers on leave, and their clothes were of all kinds, rarely seen. Some wore Cossack hats, some wore sheepskin coats, and some were dressed in rags. Their languages were also very mixed. They were all fighters of the International Brigades, whom the Spanish people called heroes. The people only hated that they didn't have what they wanted and were willing to offer it to them if they did. Like schoolchildren, pots of sugar buns were sent to them, and they devoured them in an instant. They were very unhappy because they didn't have chocolate or marmalade to eat. Only a few cafes are left that can still supply some food. The German soldiers looked older than the soldiers of other countries, and the Spanish people trusted them very much. The soldiers of the International Brigades would say to me: "Look at us, we are all majestic and high-spirited, and we are afraid of each other when we see each other." The walls of the cafes used to be decorated very gorgeously, but now they are covered with propaganda pictures that are shocking! There is a tall red tower in Madrid, now riddled with bullet holes, and a large blue python with a swastika symbol wants to swallow it. The inspector's office is dimly lit, and the desks are covered with bedding, where the clerks sleep at night. Foreign news reporters all pass through a kitchen to reach the dining room at the bottom of the "Gran Vía Hotel" and eat at a long table. When they have time, they go to their country's embassy to linger for a while, where they can breathe some neutral air. I ate in the cellar of a Spanish newspaper, where the kitchen for the newspaper staff was located. The staff talked and laughed loudly and happily. Sometimes they even threw bread at each other playfully. We often filled our stomachs with soybeans. Nowadays, not to mention delicacies, even ordinary food is not easy to get.

Movie

### Shanghai Amateur Actors Will Re-stage "Demon of Lust," "Thunderstorm," "Living Like a Drunken Dream"

The three plays "Demon of Lust," "Thunderstorm," and "Living Like a Drunken Dream," which were previously performed by Shanghai amateur actors, were not only highly praised in Shanghai, but also received honor in Nanjing. Important figures of the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters, playwrights Tian Han, Hua Han, Yu Shangyuan, Ma Yanxiang, Cao Yu, local literary and art circles, media celebrities, and the Counselor of the French Embassy and the Secretary of the Russian Embassy all nodded in praise after watching them.

Having returned from Nanjing, the manager of the Carlton Theatre has delivered more than 470 letters from Shanghai audience members requesting amateur actors to re-stage them to Mr. Zheng Junli. Among them, one was from the hand of the famous playwright Hong Shen. The executive committee of the amateurs, considering the warm hospitality of all sectors, immediately decided to perform "Demon of Lust," "Thunderstorm," and "Living Like a Drunken Dream" for seven days starting on the 12th of this month to repay the elegant wishes of all the people in Shanghai.

### "Street Angel"

Women standing on the street late at night, wandering, enduring hunger and cold, hoping for people's pity. In the midst of the bright lights and loud singing, perhaps you have seen them smile lightly, but their souls may be weeping and groaning in the endless darkness. This sound is tragic.

"Street Angel" depicts the lives of these kinds of people and the movements of the lower-class professionals who are despised by people.

"Street Angel" is the first creation of such a theme. This new type of attempt will give the audience a new and profound impression.

The director, Yuan Muzhi, is familiar to people. His achievements on the stage are undeniable, and his contributions to the film industry are equally great. This "Street Angel" is his recent new work at Mingxing Film Company, a painful and profound tragicomedy.

Here are band trumpet players, news vendors, barbers, prostitutes... The actors include Zhao Dan, Wei Heling, Zhou Xuan, Xie Jun, Wang Jiting, Qian Qianli, and others.

In addition, Ms. Zhao Huishen, who is loved by audiences on the stage, will play a guest role as a prostitute in this film.

### "Elastic Daughter" is Coming Soon

The tragic and gorgeous film "Elastic Daughter," which Yihua is about to release, has undergone a long period of half a year from the beginning of filming to completion. The theme taken for this play is a realistic drama that expounds the occupational problems of women in the metropolis and the principles of female love, making a profound determination for the young dancers wandering in the sinful metropolis.

The playwright of "Elastic Daughter," Pan Zienong, with his clever pen, new themes, and three dancers with different personalities, floats on the tormenting line of life, unable to see their smiles, only sad crying faces. Everyone also encounters various changes in love, and is buried in the socially hidden traps year after year, no matter how they struggle and fight, they are still confused in the darkness, where to find some bright way out. The theme of "Elastic Daughter" presents us with a history of blood and tears of dancers.

"Elastic Daughter" is directed by the famous director Chen Kengran. During the prosperous period of silent films, he directed a "Blood of a Dancer," leaving a very good impression. Now, repeating the old tune, using his past experience, he has handled this "Elastic Daughter" with extra care and skill, which is undoubtedly a masterpiece.

The three dancers in "Elastic Daughter" are played by Lu Ming, Yan Yuexian, and Zhu Qiuchen, which are very appropriately arranged. Xu Qinfang, Ma Loufen, Yu Guang, Qin Tong, Jiang Xiu, Zhao Manna, and others are all skilled in acting and play important roles. The other two male protagonists are played by Xu Ling and Shi Fu as guest roles. The neat cast makes "Elastic Daughter" get good harvest.

There are two songs in "Elastic Daughter," "Elastic Daughter" and "Shuang Shuang Yan," with lyrics by Pan Zienong and music by Yan Ru. The lyrics are sad and moving, and Lu Ming sings them alone. The melodious singing and profound expression have never been seen in the Chinese film industry. Moreover, "Elastic Daughter," which focuses on the theme of dancers, has not been seen in domestic films in the past. It is a valuable film recently produced by Yihua. With the film's release approaching, it is bound to cause a sensation in the Shanghai dance scene and there will be a warm grand occasion.

### Minxin News

This trip is to shoot the great disaster scenes of thousands of miles of yellow sand and starving people everywhere. Together with the temporary actors who participated in the performance in the local area, the total number is more than six or seven hundred people, and the cost will be at least more than three thousand yuan.

"The Gate of Flesh," which has created a unique style for Chinese films, has been a great success in various ports after its premiere. Therefore, various places have scrambled to order the screening rights. It is heard that more than ten copies have been printed, and another copy of the film has been reprinted with words on the screen at the same time as each line of dialogue, so that viewers who do not understand Mandarin can watch and understand completely.

Mr. Zhu Shutao and other special commissioners of the Minxin News Department have been dispatched to Sichuan to shoot news films and have now set off. Because of this spirit of not fearing difficulties, the Minxin news film has many rare harvests.

The film director, Ren Pengjian, photographed each shot on film in a stimulating and tense situation. Most of the personnel who participated in the work were people who were well versed in detective films, and it can be asserted that the results were excellent.

The script of "Brotherly Quarrel" has been approved by the Central Government. The script of "Little Gentleman" is being prepared.

### A New Type of Small Car with One Cylinder

— Li

— Two and a Half Horsepower —

The last issue of this journal published a photo of a small car made in the United Kingdom — named "Scoota." This car is very light. The fuel is also very economical. This small car can be said to be the smallest of the small cars made in the UK in the world. Now this car has actually been found in Shanghai. Isn't it very interesting?

According to Western newspapers, the "Wulin" wheel in the last issue arrived in Shanghai from Hankou. Two passengers, Mr. and Mrs. Holger, brought a smallest car. This car is called the "Scoota" special. Mr. and Mrs. Holger arrived in port in the morning and managed to get a donation certificate. So this smallest car carried them through the British Concession on Nanjing Road and straight to the Cathay Hotel. This was during the busy traffic at noon. This truly small car drove proudly on the road. According to the car owner Mr. Holger, his small car can actually run side by side with large cars that look dignified.

The manufacturer of "Scoota" is a British company that manufactures gasoline ships. This car can be said to be one of the best in terms of economy. The motor has only one cylinder. The horsepower is two and a half. This engine is the one used in motorcycle. The maximum speed per hour is forty-five miles. It is said that when driving in the UK, it can travel eighty miles per gallon of gasoline. This is similar to ordinary motorcycles. So this small car can truly be said to be between a small car and a motorcycle with a sidecar. But its advantage is that it does not have the high cost of a small car, nor the discomfort of a motorcycle.

The regular expenses of this small car are so frugal, but what is currently considered to be the fly in the ointment is that its initial purchase cost is not low. Otherwise, this car could be called the most economical four-wheeled motorcycle in the world. The car owner Holger now hopes that it can travel 60 miles per gallon of gasoline as the normal standard in the bustling streets of Shanghai. In practice, the maximum speed of this car does not seem to be very high. But it is enough for commuting in the city. Moreover, its acceleration is fast, so even if there is a high-speed turn, there will be no danger of rollover. The engine in the car is an air-cooled type. It is said that the production is very excellent.

### Automotive Miscellany

— Fool

▲The Millionth Chevrolet  Chevrolet Motor Company has recently produced one million cars in one year. This is truly an unprecedented feat in the company's history. This one million cars includes both passenger cars and trucks manufactured. The millionth Chevrolet of 1936 was completed last winter at the Plymouth plant. At that time, Chairman Chrysler himself was present. The company's previous highest record for passenger cars and trucks manufactured was 843,599 vehicles in 1935. Chrysler, in commemorating the production of this million vehicles, stated that the achievement of this record demonstrates that the automobile manufacturing industry is a vital element of society and the economy, and is still striving forward. Twenty years ago, it required the output of 300 automobile companies to achieve one million cars in a year.

▲U.S. Highway Construction Costs The U.S. is making great strides in highway construction. The expenditure for 1936 has reached US$600,000,000, as compiled by the American Road Builders' Association. Since 1931, the road construction projects of last year were the most advanced. Federal funding, including various highway project costs and subsidies, accounted for approximately US$300,000,000 of the total. It is reported that the road construction expenditure for 1937 will see even greater increases.

▲Relationship Between Alcohol and Car Accidents British physician Vernon recently presented a report at a medical research conference regarding the relationship between alcohol abuse and car accidents. He stated that although the number of car accident incidents in England has not increased compared to 1934, the average daily number of fatalities is still 18, and the number of injured exceeds 600. Although the Ministry of Transport's statistics claim that only one in eighty incidents is due to drunk driving, based on U.S. statistics, drunk driving is indeed a major cause of accidents. Even drinking small amounts of alcohol can be detrimental, as it often unknowingly increases speed. Using Widmark's test, after examining blood or urine, the symptoms can be inferred from the alcohol content. Anyone with one part per thousand of alcohol in their blood is 40% to 60% affected by alcohol. With 1.7 parts per thousand, 80% to 88% are affected. With one part per thousand, all are affected. Therefore, Vernon concluded that drivers must eliminate alcohol consumption.

▲Champion Spark Plug to Build Factory in England  A factory specializing in the production of Champion spark plugs is currently being built in England. The total project cost is approximately £100,000. The factory site occupies one acre and is located in Middlesex, near London. Previously, Champion spark plugs sold in the U.S. were entirely manufactured by the Canadian Champion factory in Windsor. Various British automobiles, including Morris, Standard, Hillman, and Ford, use Champion spark plugs as standard equipment. Due to recent strong demand, the decision was made to build a factory in England. The new factory building is one story high, with an area of 33,000 square feet. All kinds of manufacturing and assembly machinery are the latest models, capable of producing spark plugs for various automobiles and aircraft.

▲Car Race Spoiled by Ox  The recent car race hosted by the Royal East Africa Automobile Association had a total distance of 2,715 miles. Forty-two cars participated, each with a value ranging from under £1,000. During the race, the drivers experienced many surprising incidents. Among them, driver Whisteco, number eleven, was the most unfortunate. Just one hundred miles from the finish line, he suddenly had an unexpected collision. The distance he had already covered had surpassed that of his peers. The deity who determined Whisteco's fate was an ox, which snatched the victory he had already grasped. After Whisteco's car collided, the radiator at the front of the car was severely damaged, forcing him to stop and replace it. The time lost was considerable. What is comforting is that even though Whisteco did not win the championship, he still won the second prize.

▲Television Sets Prohibited in Cars  Recently, the number of people installing radios in their cars has been increasing, especially in the U.S. This is due to the development of the radio industry in the U.S. and the American emphasis on entertainment. When driving out or traveling long distances, one is not lonely. In fact, installing a radio in a car can add to the fun of a holiday trip to the countryside, where music suddenly arises amidst the green fields. Otherwise, during short trips in the city, a moment of distraction can lead to accidents. At present, American enthusiasts are also planning to install television sets in their cars. This would allow one to watch in addition to listening, which would certainly be enjoyable. However, a group of people concerned about traffic safety are deeply worried that this trend will have endless consequences. Because driving a car requires the use of both hands and eyes, if the driver is momentarily inattentive, wouldn't it be a disaster? Therefore, the National Safety Council of Atlantic City has recently made a suggestion to prohibit the installation of television sets in cars. The reasons given include "Lest Mae West's image appear on the screen, leading to more car accidents that are difficult to handle." This can be said to be putting seriousness into humor.
