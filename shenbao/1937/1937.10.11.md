### National Day: Our Troops' Morale Soars, Switching to Offensive, Advances Made on All Fronts

Enemies Attacking Guangfu Town Driven Back to Near the Highway; Enemies in Wenzaobang Surrounded, Soon to be Annihilated; Fierce Fighting in Zhabei, Our Side Victorious in Every Stage Throughout the Day

The Enemy's Fourth General Offensive Clearly Suffered a Severe Blow. For Ten Days, From Shixianggong Temple in the North, East of Guangfu Town, Both Banks of the Wenzaobang River, to Jiangwan and Zhabei in the South, the Enemy Repeatedly Launched Fierce Attacks, But Made No Progress. Yesterday, Though Enemy Troops on Both Banks of the Wenzaobang River Continued to Struggle, the So-Called General Offensive Was Actually Coming to an End. Yesterday, Despite the Rain, the Central News Agency Correspondent with the Troops Visited the Various Frontline Units and Learned That Our Army Had Begun to Switch from Defense to Offense Yesterday. For the Past Three Days, the Fighting Has Been Quite Fierce on Both Banks Centered on the Wenzaobang River. The Enemy's Attack on Xiliufangzhai Has Been Repelled, and a Unit Attacking Guangfu Town Has Been Pursued Step by Step by Our Troops and Driven to Near the Shanghai-Tai Highway, and Many Important Strongholds Have Been Recaptured. As for the Unit That Crossed the Wenzaobang River, a Large Portion of It Has Been Annihilated in Our Counterattack. The Remaining Enemy Troops, Numbering About Two Thousand, Are Trapped Along the Riverbank, But Have No Stronghold, and Are Surrounded by Us. Yesterday Afternoon, We Forced Them to Surrender Their Weapons, But the Remaining Enemy Troops Were Stubborn, and Our Troops Punished Them Severely and Will Soon Resolve the Situation Completely. Also, the Enemy Holed Up in the Wenzaobang River Station Seemed to Be Moving Westward. In Order to Preemptively Strike, We Also Launched a Sudden Attack from the Miaohang Area. The Enemy Was Caught Off Guard and Suffered Heavy Losses. At This Moment, Amidst the Enthusiastic National Day Celebrations, Our Loyal and Brave Soldiers Displayed Their Divine Might and Severely Wounded the Enemy, Further Increasing Our Confidence in Winning the Final Victory.

The Enemy Troops Claimed They Could Break Through Our Lines by October 15 and Force Our Troops to Retreat to the Jiading-Nanxiang Line. Therefore, After the Start of the Fourth General Offensive, They First Broke Through Our Shanghai-Tai Highway Line at Taipingqiao Baojianong, and Then Constantly Attacked Our Guangfu and Shixianggong Temple with Heavy Troops. However, After Our Valiant Resistance, They Suffered a Severe Blow, and Changed Their Target. On the Third of This Month, They Used Illegal Weapons Such as Poison Gas to Force a Crossing of the Wenzaobang River, Thinking They Could Then Drive Straight In. The Enemy Also Claimed That They Could Achieve Their Goal by October 10. Unexpectedly, They Were Met With a Fierce Counterattack From Our Troops, and Lost Their Bearing. It Is a Pity That the Continuous Rain Has Caused Water to Accumulate in the Fields, Hindering Our Troops' Movements, So We Have Not Been Able to Sweep Away and Eliminate the Enemy Sooner. After Repelling the Enemy on the Frontal Positions of Guangfu Town, the Enemy Has Moved Southward. Therefore, Since the Ninth, the Fighting in That Area Has Been Less Intense Than Before. However, the Fighting Between Tangqiao Station and Lujiaxiang on the North Bank of the Yunzaobang River Has Gradually Become More Intense. Although Several Points on Our Warning Line Southwest of Tangqiao Have Been Breached by the Enemy, We Have Transferred Fresh Troops to Encircle and Vigorously Attack the Enemy. The Enemy's Attempt to Coordinate With the Black Dahwangzhai Unit on the South Bank Will Surely Fail.

On the Positions North of Luodian Caowang Temple, the Enemy Troops Again Used Poison Gas to Attack Us. Dozens of Our Soldiers Were Poisoned, Becoming Unconscious and Vomiting. However, Our Troops' Positions Are Still Extremely Solid and Have Not Changed at All, Sufficient to Cope With Everything With Ease.

### Counterattacking the 63rd Garden, Our Troops Engaged in Bloody Melee Combat With the Enemy

Fierce Fighting Also Reported in Zhabei

The Central News Agency Correspondent Reported at 1 AM on the 11th: Yesterday Morning, Our Three Routes of Counterattack in the Jiangwan Area Repelled the Enemy Attacking From the 63rd Garden Area. Later, We Took Advantage of the Victory to Search and Advance. There Was No Sign of the Enemy on Tongli Road. Then, as the Rain Poured Down, Hindering Movement, We Did Not Press the Attack on the Enemy's Nest. At About 7 PM, As the Rain Subsided Slightly, We Immediately Launched a Two-Pronged Attack, Still Advancing Along the West Line of the Henghang River and Tongli Road Towards the 63rd Garden. At the Same Time, The Zhizhi University Also Launched a Feigned Attack on the Enemy Positions at the Patriotic Girls' School to Tie Down Their Forces. The Vanguards Met at the Intersection of Tongli Road and Immediately Exchanged Machine Gun Fire. Although the Enemy Marine Corps Headquarters' Artillery Fire Was Fierce, We Still Pressed Forward Stage by Stage. After an Hour and a Half of Fierce Fighting, Our Troops Launched a Violent Charge and Engaged the Enemy in Hand-to-Hand Combat. As of the Report, They Were Still Engaged in Bloody Battle. Also, the Enemy on North Sichuan Road, At About 8 PM, Launched an Attack From Guangdong Street Qiujiang Road and Dongbaoxing Road With a Company-Sized Force. This Move By the Enemy Seemed to Be Aimed at Tying Down Our Forces Counterattacking the Baziqiao Area. However, We Had Made Preparations Early. When the Enemy Charged Close, We Courageously Met Them in Battle. After An Hour of Fierce Fighting, We Killed More Than 30 Enemy Soldiers to Blunt Their Attack. Then, According to Intelligence Reports, Enemy Tanks on North Sichuan Road Were Moving Abnormally, Seeming to Have Other Intentions. But As of the Report, the Enemy and We Were Locked in Standoff and There Were No Changes.

### Continuing the Spirit of the Martyrs, Our Soldiers Bravely Kill the Enemy

Pudong Artillery Displays Might, Inflicts Heavy Damage on the Enemy

Yesterday Was National Day Commemoration Day. Our Frontline Soldiers Fighting Against the Japanese Continued the Difficult Spirit of the Martyrs Who Founded the Republic of China, Bravely Charged and Killed, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy. Our Valiant Air Force Was Unable to Come to Shanghai Yesterday Due to the All-Day Heavy Rain. In Addition to the Tragic and Enthusiastic Commemoration Ceremony, the Entire City of Shanghai Was Unusually Quiet All Day in the Bitter Wind and Drizzling Rain. However, At 8 PM, Our Pudong Artillery Suddenly Broke Through the Dull Air Over the Huangpu River, and Heavily Bombed the Yangshupu Area With Heavy Shells. The Enemy Was Panic-Stricken and Retaliated From Warships. The Heavy Bombardment Continued Until 11 PM, and Giant Explosions Could Be Heard in the Eastern District, Likely From Our Heavy Artillery Hitting the Enemy's Positions and Displaying Its Power. At That Time, The Enemy Naval Pier Caught Fire Immediately, and the Lao Sanjing Pier in Yangjing District, Pudong Also Caught Fire at the Same Time. The Bombardment Ceased at Midnight.

### Zhabei: Our Troops Encircle and Repel the Enemy

The Central News Agency Correspondent Reported at 1:30 PM on the 10th: Last Night (the 9th), the Enemy in the 63rd Garden Area Launched an Attack on Our Baziqiao Area. We Flanked the Enemy From Fangjiamuqiao Along the Henghang River and Liuying Road. At the Same Time, Our Guangdong Middle School Also Sent a Team to Attack the Side of the 63rd Garden From Tongli Road. Seeing That the Situation Was Unfavorable, the Enemy Immediately Transferred About Two Companies From the Patriotic Girls' School to Assist in Harassing Us. Our Troops Were Well Connected on All Three Sides, and Launched Multiple Attacks. After Four Hours of Fierce Fighting in Heavy Rain, We Killed About 70 Enemy Soldiers, Including One Company Commander. By About 4 AM This Morning (the 10th), the Enemy's Morale Was Exhausted, and They Fled Towards the 63rd Garden and the Patriotic Girls' School.

Although the Enemy's Artillery Fire Was Very Fierce, After Our Head-On Heavy Blow, After About Three Hours of Street Fighting, Over 70 Enemy Soldiers Were Annihilated. The Enemy Then Retreated. According to Intelligence Reports, The Enemy Has Repeatedly Attacked Our Zhabei and Jiangwan and Other Places, But Has Not Succeeded. They Are Now Digging Tunnels in Order to Bomb Our Fortifications. However, We Have Strict Precautions, and The Enemy's Attempt Will Definitely Fail.

[Nanjing] On the morning of the tenth, the National Day commemoration meeting was held. Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang and Chairman Wang arrived at the National Government on time.

Ambassadors and consuls from various countries stationed in Nanjing, including England, America, France, Germany, Russia, and the Netherlands, extended their congratulations to our government in the morning. The Bureau of Ceremonies dispatched personnel to receive and express gratitude. (Tenth Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The Central Party Headquarters held a National Day commemoration meeting this morning. Attendees included Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Zhaoming, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Chonghui, Ye Chucang, Bai Chongxi, He Yingqin, Zhang Ji, Jiang Zuobin, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Chen Gongbo, Wu Zhongxin, Gu Zhenglun, Zhang Daofan, Cheng Tiangu, Chen Shaokuan, Duan Xipeng, Peng Xuepei, Chen Shuren, Gan Naiguang, Ma Chaojun, Zhang Lisheng, Zeng Zhongming, Qian Dajun, Jiao Yitang, Wang Yongbin, Gu Zhenggang, Xu Kan, Gu Zhengding, Liu Jiwen, Mao Zuquan, Wang Bingjun, Mei Gongren, Liang Hancao, Di Ying, Wen Yiyou, Wang Maogong, Chen Bijun, Zhang Zhen, Wang Shufang, Zeng Kuoqing, Hong Lanyou, Xiong Kewu, and Luo Yiqun, Hu Wenshuo and more than fifty others. Chairman Wang presided over the meeting and delivered a report. The meeting adjourned at approximately one o'clock. The report is recorded as follows: Today is the 26th National Day of the Republic of China. The greatest significance of this National Day is that the second half of the National Revolution has now begun. Its purpose is to fight for the survival of the Republic of China, and to fight for the freedom and equality of the Republic of China. This struggle is manifested in resisting Japanese aggression and overthrowing Japanese aggressionism. The first half of the National Revolution, according to the necessary stages, was a difficult struggle for domestic unification. Now we can say that, as a result of the struggle, unification has been achieved. From now on, we no longer need to expend effort on internal matters. Every drop of blood and every penny from our compatriots and comrades will be used to resist Japanese aggression and overthrow Japanese aggressionism. Our entire nation is determined that everyone must sacrifice and resist everywhere. We take the entire regiment's martyrdom in Nankou and the entire battalion's martyrdom in Baoshan as examples. We know that the armed comrades in Shanghai are continuing to advance along these bloody footprints. Because of this, from August 13th until today, the enemy, with all its land, sea, and air forces, even if it has broken through one of our points, has ultimately been unable to affect our entire line. Moreover, that one point is still being lost and regained, retreating and advancing. The ability of the Shanghai battle to last so long is by no means accidental. On the Shanxi front, although Datong suffered a defeat, because they were able to acknowledge the defeat, bear the responsibility for the defeat, and strive to salvage the situation, the morale of the army and the people can still be roused and stand firm. We hope that the Pinghan and Jinpu fronts can do the same. In short, we must be determined that everyone must sacrifice and resist everywhere. This is the factor for endurance, and also the factor for final victory. Japan's aggression and our resistance have aroused the condemnation of Japan by various countries, as well as their sympathy and assistance for us. Not only the government, but also the enthusiastic expressions of various civil society organizations are particularly inspiring to us. At the same time, we know that Japan will therefore use even more brutal means to intensify its attacks on us, in order to create the so-called fait accompli that it dreams of. Therefore, from today onwards, we must make every possible effort to strengthen our resistance, so that the sympathy and assistance of various countries can be further advanced to jointly remove the greatest obstacles to human justice. Today is National Day. We unanimously shout to resist Japanese aggression, overthrow Japanese aggressionism, safeguard the survival of the Republic of China, promote the realization of freedom and equality in the Republic of China, and promote the realization of world peace. Long live freedom and equality in the Republic of China, long live world peace. (Tenth Central News Agency Telegram)

[Nanjing] The National Government held a National Day commemoration meeting in Nanjing on the tenth. At six o'clock in the morning, the national flag with the blue sky and white sun was raised amidst the sound of music, soaring proudly in the sky, a scene of solemnity and dignity, fully expressing the spirit of our resistance. The meeting began at seven o'clock sharp. Central figures attending included Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Dai Jitao, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Chen Shuren, Bai Chongxi, Zhu Qinglan, He Yingqin, Jiang Zuobin, Wang Shijie, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Yongbin, Lin Yunhai, Jing Hengyi, Yu Feipeng, Wang Boqun, Ma Chaojun, and all staff members of the three departments of civil service, military affairs, and accounting, totaling more than four hundred people. Chairman Chiang wore a military uniform and sword, appearing radiant. Chairman Lin wore a black cloak, with a dignified demeanor. After performing the rituals, Chairman Lin delivered a report, with the speech promoting the raising of comfort funds for the resistance soldiers and cotton-padded clothes for wounded soldiers and refugees. The original text is recorded as follows:

Today is the Double Tenth Festival, the National Day of the birth of the Republic of China. In principle, we should be rejoicing and celebrating enthusiastically on this day every year. However, this year's Double Tenth Festival finds many places and many compatriots across the country threatened by Japanese aircraft bombs and artillery fire. Frontline soldiers, fighting for national independence and ethnic survival, are engaged in a desperate battle with the enemy. Today, we should use the spirit and enthusiasm of rejoicing and enthusiastic celebration from previous years to comfort our loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country, and to provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees in various places. We must understand that this war of resistance is related to the life and death of the entire nation and the entire ethnic group. If we win the war of resistance, the Chinese nation will have hope of revival from now on. Otherwise, the future of our country will be unimaginable. Therefore, today, we should gather the intelligence, physical strength, material resources, and financial resources of compatriots across the country to resist this unprecedented foreign invasion and to safeguard the survival and independence of our nation. The so-called comprehensive war of resistance means not only that the armies in various parts of the country are fighting at the same time, but also that people from all walks of life in various parts of the country are participating in the work of the war of resistance at the same time. Those with strength contribute strength, those with wealth contribute wealth, or contribute to the country with their intelligence and talent, or donate their industries and goods for military use. Educators strive to popularize education, and the industrial sector strives to increase production. The entire country, from young to old, men and women, everyone fulfills their responsibility and does their part. This is in line with the true meaning of comprehensive war of resistance, and it is a true national mobilization. The ancients had a saying: "The rise and fall of a country is the responsibility of every individual." This means that when the country is invaded by foreign enemies, everyone should assume the responsibility of resisting the enemy and saving the country. Now is the time for our country to implement a comprehensive war of resistance against the enemy invading our territory. Because of our duties or other reasons, we cannot personally participate in frontline combat, so we should do our best to support the frontline battles, and do as much spiritual or material help as possible for the loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country. Therefore, on this National Day of the birth of the Republic of China, we use the spirit and enthusiasm of rejoicing and enthusiastic celebration from previous years to comfort our loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country, and to express our infinite love and respect to our loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country. On the one hand, it has great significance, and on the other hand, it is indeed the duty and responsibility of all our compatriots in the rear. We hope that compatriots across the country will unite from today onwards to carry out a large-scale comfort movement, raise a large amount of comfort funds, and continue to provide spiritual comfort and material assistance to our loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country, so that our loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country will increase their courage to resist the war, drive out strong enemies for the country, and win glory for the nation. We must know that for every point of courage the frontline soldiers increase in resisting the war, our country will increase one point of strength in resisting the enemy. And in order for our frontline soldiers to continue to increase their courage to resist the war, it all depends on the ability of our compatriots in the rear to continue to do more to help with the war of resistance. Therefore, it is indeed an indispensable and important task for our country at present that compatriots across the country unite today to carry out a large-scale comfort movement and raise a large amount of comfort funds. At the same time, the wounded soldiers in various places are all loyal and brave warriors sent back from the front lines, and the refugees in various places are compatriots who have been displaced by the threat of enemy aircraft and artillery. We should also give them spiritual comfort and material relief at the same time. Winter is approaching and the weather is gradually getting colder. When compatriots across the country raise comfort funds for the frontline soldiers, they should also raise a large number of cotton-padded clothes for the wounded soldiers and refugees in various places to meet the needs of the wounded soldiers and refugees in various places for protection from the cold in winter. This is also the responsibility and work that all our compatriots in the rear should fulfill, and it is a responsibility that must be fulfilled and work that must be done. In short, at this time, our country should fully demonstrate the spirit of comprehensive war of resistance. The 400 million compatriots across the country should each fulfill a responsibility and each do a part in the war of resistance. Those on the front lines fulfill the responsibilities of the front lines, and those in the rear fulfill the responsibilities of the rear. The entire country is united, and all the people are of one heart. There should not be the slightest slackness at any time. If we can do this, we believe that the final victory of the war of resistance will definitely belong to us. Today is the National Day of the birth of the Republic of China. We hope that in the near future, another National Day for the victory of the war of resistance will be produced. We hope that compatriots across the country will encourage each other and work together. (Tenth Central News Agency Telegram)

### British Cruiser Officers Arrive in Hong Kong from Hankou

[Guangzhou] The train carrying officers from the British warship HMS Gannet, originally scheduled to pass through Guangzhou at around 3:00 PM on the 29th, was delayed until 5:30 PM due to an air raid alert in Guangzhou. The train stopped briefly at the Shipai Station on the eastern outskirts of Guangzhou and received greetings from British expatriate officials and civilians, then proceeded directly to Hong Kong via the Kowloon-Canton Railway. A reporter boarded the train at Shipai for an interview. According to them, the train departed from Wuchang on the 6th and traveled south, arriving safely along the way. However, upon reaching Hengyang, it was heard that Japanese planes had bombed the station after the train departed from Zhuzhou. After entering Guangdong, the train was delayed due to bombing damage to the tracks in many places. On the 8th, as the train approached Yingde, 13 Japanese planes were seen approaching head-on. The train stopped immediately, and shortly thereafter a loud explosion was heard. It was later learned that several bombs had fallen approximately one mile in front of the train. Before long, more bomb sounds were heard. It was then reported that a bridge approximately three miles in front of the train had also been bombed, causing us to be stranded in Yingde for more than ten hours. The difficulty of this trip was truly unexpected. The British authorities had formally notified Tokyo and the Japanese military commander in Shanghai before the train was scheduled to depart. Fortunately, thanks to the goodwill and perseverance of the Chinese railway authorities, the HMS Gannet train, which is memorable in history, was finally able to safely reach its destination. We are deeply grateful and deeply admire the Chinese railway workers. As for the bombing damage along the way, we have all witnessed it and it is deeply imprinted in our minds.

### Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Legal Tender Conversion of Gold

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance recently formulated detailed rules for the implementation of the legal tender conversion of gold, which were announced on the tenth by ministerial order. At the same time, it was telegraphed to the provincial and municipal governments to urge strict supervision and earnest implementation. The details of the item are recorded below: (1) Military and police agencies should protect those who carry gold to the conversion agencies for conversion and should not obstruct them. Except for private smuggling of gold for export and private carrying of gold in coastal areas with the intention of smuggling it for export, which is found by the customs, it will still be handled in accordance with the general case of prohibiting gold exports. The method of the Ministry of Finance that had been previously set for transporting raw gold in the interior to obtain a certificate from the chamber of commerce at the place of departure, should be stopped. (2) The daily posted market price of pure gold at the Central Bank should be telegraphed to the branches of the four banks of the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural banks in various provinces, and copied to the post offices or postal savings and remittance bureaus at all levels, and other entrusted agencies, and posted on the door for public announcement.

### Executive Yuan Pays Attention to Relief Work

[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan instructed the provincial and municipal governments that as the war zone is expanding and the number of refugees is increasing, it is imperative to take in and appease them. All our countrymen should rise up together. It is hoped that local governments at all levels will gather manpower and financial resources to jointly plan and implement the work. No penny of the funds for relief work should be wasted. (Tenth Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Since our country's war of resistance, foreign friends have been extremely concerned about the relief of our wounded and dead people. In the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, in addition to Shanghai, there are still more than 120 American doctors, nurses, and missionaries engaged in refugee relief work in the original places. Their families have been sent to Manila for temporary residence. At present, overseas Chinese in the United States are training for relief work and are preparing to return home to serve in the front lines in the near future. In Singapore and other parts of Southeast Asia, our country's medical personnel have been returning to the country one after another to participate in frontline work. (Tenth Special Dispatch)

### Enemy Attempts to Break Through Fail, Our Left Flank is as Solid as Gold

Enemy Conspiracy Fails After Fierce Fighting for Ten Days, Battalion Commander Lei's Entire Battalion Dies at Xu Residence Positions, Enemy Resorts to Using Poison Gas Due to Lack of Opportunities

On our left flank, the enemy has repeatedly launched fierce attacks in recent days, but all have been bravely repelled by our army. A Central News Agency reporter visited the war zone and inquired with a senior staff officer in charge of commanding the area about the latest combat situation as follows:

Enemy's Attempt Has Become a Fantasy

Based on the recent situation of the enemy's repeated general attacks on our left flank, and what can be inferred from various documents obtained from the enemy, the enemy intends to realize its plan for a central breakthrough before the Double Tenth Festival, seize our two locations of Nanxiang and Jiading, and force the withdrawal of our troops stationed in the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas without fighting. However, our side has noticed the enemy's attempt, so we have also taken strict precautions for the military in that area, strengthened our strength, and strengthened our fortifications. Although the enemy is stubborn, they will not succeed in the end, and now the enemy's attempt has become a fantasy.

Heroic Sacrifice at Xu Residence Positions

Our side is fighting with high morale, and everyone is determined to live and die with the positions. At the beginning of this month, the enemy launched several fierce attacks on our Xu Residence positions. Our battalion commander Lei Hanchi, who was stationed there, led his brave soldiers and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, but our side also suffered heavy casualties. However, enemy reinforcements kept coming. Our battalion commander Lei stubbornly defended the positions and never retreated. The enemy surrounded our section of the positions. Our battalion commander Lei raised his arms and shouted, and the loyal and brave warriors bravely rushed out of the trenches and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Enemy corpses were strewn everywhere, but because we were outnumbered, all the soldiers and the positions were lost, and our battalion commander Lei also died there. This admirable and touching spirit is enough to be a model for all ages.

Enemy Barbarously Uses Poison Gas

On the 5th of this month, a large enemy team invaded our positions near Shi Xianggong Temple, including Jinjia Residence, Lu Residence, and Bei Zhou Residence. Although the enemy's firepower was extremely fierce, our army responded calmly. The enemy was only wasting bullets. The enemy recklessly charged into our positions, and our army surrounded and attacked them. The enemy was in a panic and fled in defeat, abandoning many spoils of war. The enemy was so enraged that it disregarded everything and released sneezing gas bombs in the faint light of dawn the next day. A portion of our army was unprepared and fell into a state of confusion. The enemy's inhumanity can be seen from this.

Commentary

### The Road to Victory

— Hu Yuzhi

The Republic of China has existed for twenty-six years, but this is the first time the entire nation has engaged in a war against a foreign enemy. Naturally, we also participated in World War I, but as everyone knows, China's participation was merely nominal; at most, we followed the Allied powers, waving flags and shouting slogans. A genuine war against a foreign enemy has never before occurred in the history of the Republic.

A genuine war against a foreign enemy is a war between countries. The enemy uses the power of their entire nation to invade and slaughter us. Naturally, we can only use the power of our entire nation to defend ourselves.

The phrase "the power of the entire nation" should be given special emphasis. During the Qing dynasty, we experienced many wars against foreign enemies, including the Opium War, the Sino-French War, the Sino-Russian War, and the First Sino-Japanese War. But the results we obtained were only compromise, submission, ceding territory, and paying indemnities. This was because during the Qing dynasty, we did not use the power of the entire nation to engage in resistance against foreign enemies, and it was also impossible to use the power of the entire nation to engage in resistance against foreign enemies. Originally, the "nation" at that time was the "nation" privately owned by the Qing imperial family, and not the "nation" jointly owned by the 400 million people. The Qing dynasty minister Gangyi had a saying: "Rather give it to neighboring friends than hand it over to household slaves." The Qing imperial edicts even advocated "measuring the material resources of China to win the favor of friendly nations." Under such political conditions, it was absolutely impossible to mobilize the power of the entire nation to resist foreign enemies.

The policy of "rather give it to neighboring friends than hand it over to household slaves" ultimately led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty's three-hundred-year rule. After the Xinhai Revolution, the "nation" became a nation jointly owned by 400 million people, and no longer the private property of a small number of people. However, because the Republic had not experienced a genuine war against a foreign enemy since its establishment, people did not genuinely feel the need for the "nation" or the preciousness of the "nation" until recently. After the Xinhai Revolution, we spent twenty-five whole years engaged in internal conflicts. It was not until the Japanese invaders occupied one-third of China's territory, and after six years of national crisis, that we awakened and united as a nation to resist foreign enemies. This is something we should not avoid mentioning.

There is currently an argument circulating not only abroad but also believed by some people within the country, which states: "A country can only be strong externally if it implements autocracy and dictatorship internally; democracy has no power externally." Hitler advocated this, Mussolini advocated this, and the Japanese militarists also advocated this. There is nothing wrong with this, because in fascist aggressor countries, the people oppose war, so to engage in foreign aggression, it is first necessary to implement autocracy and dictatorship internally. But in peace-loving countries and countries being invaded, it is exactly the opposite. In countries being invaded, the people are willing to defend their country and fight, and what they oppose is only surrendering to foreign enemies. Therefore, only democracy can increase the power of resistance against foreign enemies. The result of autocracy and dictatorship is only to weaken the power of the country. The policies of the late Qing dynasty are an example.

A country being invaded, to resist a powerful enemy, needs two essential conditions: unity and democracy. And these two conditions are inseparable. Without unity, there is no democracy; without democracy, unity cannot be consolidated.

Now, unity has already become a reality. What we need is democracy. It is very easy to understand why democracy is needed during the war of resistance. If the people all know that they are the masters of the country, there is no one who would not be willing to dedicate themselves to defending their country. If the people have little connection with the country, then even if they are forced to resist, there is little chance of victory.

There is nothing more needed than the people during the war of resistance. The replenishment of manpower at the front lines requires the people. The transportation and supply of the army requires the people. The supply and rescue in the rear requires the people. In a war of resistance by the entire nation, victory or defeat is not determined by weapons, but by the number of people mobilized. This mobilization includes not only the military aspect but also the political, economic, labor, technical, and cultural aspects. In a civil war, what is needed is only a part of the hired army, but in a war against a foreign enemy, especially a war against a powerful aggressor, it is necessary for the entire population to participate. But whether the broad masses of people, if they cannot participate in the politics of the country, can spontaneously and heroically participate in the war against foreign enemies is indeed a question.

The activities of traitors existing everywhere are indeed a shameful fact. But the fact that there are traitors among the Chinese people does not mean that the Chinese people do not love their country. I believe that most traitors are traitors because their lives are too unconnected with the country, so they will recognize the enemy as their father.

Therefore, to support the war of resistance and achieve final victory, there is only one great road: democracy. As long as the Three Principles of the People are thoroughly implemented, the principles of government of the people, by the people, and for the people are thoroughly practiced, and all the people are organized, so that all the people enjoy legal freedom, not only can national mobilization be completed immediately, but also the unified power of 450 million compatriots can be used to fight against foreign aggression, and final victory will not be a problem. And only in this way is the only road to victory.

Today is National Day, and it is also our first National Day after resisting the brutal Japanese. If we do not forget the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for national independence and freedom, and if we still remember the teachings of the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, we should wholeheartedly rise up together and, following the path of democratic unity, strive for the glorious victory of the imperiled Republic of China. "Be cruel to the enemy, be tolerant to our own people!" This saying especially needs to be kept in mind by everyone at all times.

Editor's note: This article was written to commemorate National Day. Due to space limitations, it could not be published in yesterday's newspaper, so it is being published today.

On the morning of the 10th, the enemy opened fire on our Fushan, but we did not retaliate. Many wooden rafts and bamboo rafts were also found in the center of the river, brought by the warships, seemingly for the purpose of landing. However, we are fearless. (10th Dispatch)

### Zhang Zizhong Stays in Nanjing Awaiting Punishment

[Nanjing] Zhang Zizhong, former Mayor of Tianjin, arrived in Nanjing from Jinan a few days ago. When reporters interviewed him, Zhang said, "I am a soldier, and it is my duty to defend the country and guard the territory. I dare not lag behind others. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, I immediately actively deployed defenses. Later, Chairman Song ordered me on July 28 to go to Baoding and instructed me to stay in Beiping to act as the Military and Political Affairs Officer of Hebei and Chahar. Under orders, I felt deeply apprehensive, fearing that my talent would not be up to the task and would delay the overall situation. I repeatedly declined, but in the end, I had to accept the order with tears. I then ordered the Shi Brigade stationed in the city to ensure the order of Beiping and resist the Japanese army. On the one hand, I sent personnel to contact the troops stationed in Baoding, and on the other hand, I telegraphed Vice Division Commander Li Wentian in Tianjin to lead his troops to work hard to kill the enemy, and telegraphed the officers and soldiers not to forget that they were Chinese citizens. Later, because the connection between Beiping and Baoding was cut off, and most of the enemy troops were forcing their way into the suburbs, trapped in the isolated city, and external aid was cut off, I ordered the Shi Brigade to break through to Chahar. I also led the pistol team out of Beiping. Unexpectedly, as soon as I left Deshengmen, I was attacked by the enemy's ambush troops, causing me to lose contact with the Shi Brigade. I had no choice but to return to the city and hide in Beiping. On September 3, I went to Tianjin alone and transferred south. When passing through Jinan, I stayed for more than ten days due to illness. During this time, I met with Chairman Han Xiangfang several times. His loyalty to resisting the enemy and defending the country has been consistent from beginning to end, and there are already facts to show it. The rumors that I lobbied Chairman Han for the Japanese while passing through Shandong were purely enemy tactics to sow discord. I have now arrived in Nanjing from Beiping, and these rumors should be self-defeating. I have been in the army for twenty years, and I love the country's support and the leader's training. Although my nature is foolish, I am confident in my loyalty. However, due to my lack of talent and the exhaustion of my strength, I failed the mission of the party and the country, and I dare not shirk the blame for the mistake. This time, I came to Nanjing to report the situation to the Chairman and the Central Committee, and to request punishment. The National Government issued a clear order to rectify discipline, only removing me from office and investigating, without adding strict condemnation. Yesterday, I met with the Chairman and received encouragement, allowing me to atone for my sins. I am deeply grateful and moved. If there is a chance to serve in the future, I swear to use my remaining life to fight desperately to defend the country under the guidance of the great and selfless national leader, and I will not hesitate to go through fire and water. As for my current whereabouts, I will stay in the capital as a criminal awaiting orders." (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Asahi Shimbun

Comments on the Japanese Foreign Ministry Declaration

[Tokyo] An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun on the 10th, commenting on the statement issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 9th, said that the traces of caution are clearly visible, but it only carefully considers and diligently makes up for the defects of the frank statement made by the Foreign Ministry spokesman a day earlier. It is doubtful whether its strength is enough to explain the unprecedented situation in which Japan is using the power of the whole country to fight. Everyone has a feeling of inadequacy. Although the Nine-Power Treaty has not been abolished or changed, the changing situation means that it is not a completely effective treaty. It would not be wrong to call it a dead letter. Therefore, the one point that has been reserved and not stated, whether or not to participate in the Nine-Power Conference, should be stated in a dignified manner that it will not participate. Even if it participates, it must first propose to abolish or greatly revise the treaty to deal with the situation. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Italy Refuses to Negotiate on Spanish Issue with Britain and France

Advocates Continued Discussion by the Non-Intervention Committee / European Situation Becomes Tense Again / Britain and France Consider Countermeasures

[Paris] Regarding the suggestion of Britain and France inviting Italy to hold talks and discuss the non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the Italian government submitted a reply today, rejecting it and stating that Italy advocates that the issue of non-intervention should continue to be discussed by the London Adjustment Committee. This reply has been published simultaneously in Paris and London. Its content states that the Italian government has taken note of the guarantees provided by Britain and France regarding respecting Spain's political independence. The Italian government also declared its determination to maintain Spain's territorial integrity. Regarding the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries from Spain, Italy and Germany were the first to propose it. Although the Italian government attaches importance to the proposal by Britain and France to hold talks to discuss this matter, this issue is not only related to certain countries. In addition to Britain, France, and Italy, other countries are also directly involved. This fact should be noted. Moreover, any decision, if not accepted by both parties in the Spanish Civil War, will inevitably fail to produce practical results. It is recalled that the representative of the Valencian government of Spain, in his speech at the League of Nations General Assembly, used the pretext that the foreign volunteers belonging to his government were of a different nature from those belonging to the Nationalist army and expressed his unwillingness to withdraw them. The Italian government therefore firmly believes that any procedure, even if it is a preliminary procedure, if taken outside the framework of the London Adjustment Committee, will not only fail to reduce all misunderstandings and disputes but will aggravate them, delaying the establishment of a general agreement. This is not a wise move. In addition, the Italian reply also stated that the Italian government does not wish to participate in any talks or meetings that do not formally invite the German government to participate or in which the German government does not participate. (Central News Agency)

[London] Mussolini's rejection of Britain and France's request, refusing to directly negotiate the recall of Spanish volunteers, has caused the European situation to take a sharp turn. If Britain and France do not swallow their pride and retreat, they will put into practice their earlier statement to open the French-Spanish border, allowing volunteers from various countries to freely enter Spain. Today, within hours after receiving Italy's reply of rejection, the foreign ministries of both countries convened meetings to discuss whether to take retaliatory measures. Officials acknowledge that both countries must take some action immediately to counter Mussolini's determination to maintain or increase Italy's military presence in Spain. Otherwise, the Spanish government forces may fail, and Spain will become a fascist state ruled by Italy. As for the rumors that France has decided to open the border on Monday, they are not entirely credible. The British Foreign Office has stated that there will be no unexpected actions this week. Political circles deeply believe that Britain and France may have to resort to force to prevent a European war. (National Telegram, 10th)

### Italian Government Conscripts New Soldiers

If the French-Spanish Border is Opened / Italy Will Publicly Aid the Spanish War

[Rome] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has begun to conscript troops today to prepare for retaliatory measures by Britain and France. Officials claim that the three classes of conscripts from 1907, 1908, and 1909 have been ordered to prepare for deployment at any time. Diplomatic circles generally believe that if France opens the border, these Italian troops will be sent to Spain. (National Telegram, 10th)

[Rome] Well-informed sources here say that Italy's reply to Britain and France's invitation to participate in the three-nation conference is constructive because Italy will never give up its determination to defeat communism in Spain in the slightest. However, to prevent the peace mechanism from being suspended, it has suggested further discussions within the Non-Intervention Committee. Therefore, the responsibility for how to proceed from now on rests entirely with Britain and France. It is said that if the French-Spanish border is opened, the hope for European peace will hang by a thread. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)

### German Defense Minister Arrives at Funshal Island

Arousing General Attention

⊙ Portuguese-owned Funshal Island, West Africa. German Defense Minister General Blumberg arrived here from Germany aboard the German light cruiser "Greer" and landed here yesterday. (Note: Funshal Island is a Portuguese territory in the Atlantic Ocean. Germans have been active on the island for a long time, and its military significance is quite important. Therefore, General Blumberg's sudden visit to the island has aroused general attention). (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)

### Spanish Government Prepares to Move Capital to Barcelona

⊙ Perpignan, France. According to news from Barcelona, the Spanish Republican government plans to move its seat from Valencia to that city, and preparations are actively underway. Given the current situation, it is very inconvenient for the various government departments to operate in Valencia. Moreover, since the government forces have been reorganized, there is no need for the government seat to be close to Madrid. Spanish President Azaña has already moved to Barcelona since last November. After the government moves, it can work in conjunction with the president, and the general life in Barcelona remains normal, making it more convenient to establish administrative agencies and creating better working conditions. In addition, the establishment of the government in Barcelona also signifies the internal unity of the Spanish Republic. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)

### Coming and Going Amidst Bombing

— Guo Moruo

(II)

I arrived in Suzhou on the evening of the twenty-first and called Qiaofeng on the phone. Qiaofeng had already left. I decided to stay overnight in Wuxian that night.

The place where I stayed had osmanthus flowers, which were emitting a strong, sweet fragrance in the dark. There were occasional air raid alarms, but I was very calm. I slept very soundly, because all my luggage was newly made in Shanghai when I came, and I felt quite comfortable.

The next day, because I had to wait for the car to come from the front, I had plenty of leisure. I toured Suzhou City in the morning. The citizens were still calm, but most of the shops were closed. I found this psychology a bit ridiculous. Closing the shops is probably to prevent bombing, but if the plane's bombs don't hit your shop, why do you need to close the door! If the bombs hit your shop, what's the use of closing the door? It's more accurate to say that everyone is not brave enough, rather than not smart enough.

I remembered that there were two old seniors in Suzhou who were worth visiting specially, one was Mr. Li Genyuan, and the other was Mr. Zhang Yimo. These two gentlemen, according to my impressions from the visits, are truly worthy of being called "great elders of the world."

I met Mr. Li in a small farmer's house. He was dressed unusually plainly, and at first sight, he reminded me of Guan Zhuangmiao in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

Mr. Li was in very good spirits, but he had some kind of skin disease on the right side of his neck, with the skin appearing copper-colored and scaly, causing swelling of the lymph nodes under his right jaw. Mr. Li spoke vigorously and intensely, as if recalling the general who commanded the three armies in the past.

Mr. Li said that his idea was "internal king and external hegemon." He advocated that China's actions should only focus on national defense, and all constructions that beautify peace are unnecessary. The result of the Battle of Songhu proved this.

Mr. Li also said that before the thirteenth, he didn't admire Mr. Chiang very much, but after the thirteenth, he could kowtow to him.

When he said these words, his attitude was unusually sincere, and his bright eyes seemed to have moisture, and fine beads of sweat appeared on his face.

The American missionaries in Suzhou are very enthusiastic about rescuing wounded soldiers. Soldiers enjoy entering Suzhou hospitals, because the surgery is good and the treatment is also good. After the death of American envoy Johnson, the missionaries withdrew from China, but the missionaries were unwilling to leave. This news was also told to me by Mr. Li.

Mr. Li's impression was similar to Guan Yu; Mr. Zhang's impression was quite similar to Zhuge Kongming. Mr. Zhang is not very tall, with a triangular face, no beard, and fair skin. Although he has no lun towel or feather fan, his clear and bright aura is evident.

Mr. Zhang is the organizer of the "Laozi Army" that spread widely in the recent newspapers. His organization was naturally interrupted by Mr. Chiang's telegram obstruction, but he had a reply telegram, which has not yet been spread in the newspapers. Mr. Zhang took out the draft telegram for me to see. The draft was written in ink on the back of several large waste calendar papers. The wording was earnest and moving. I asked Mr. Zhang to publish it in the "National Salvation Daily," and Mr. Zhang readily agreed.

Mr. Zhang said that he met Mr. Feng Huanzhang somewhere a few days ago. Mr. Huanzhang said that he was in good spirits. He said, "I am usually not well and often get sick, but since August 13th, my spirits have been a hundred times better, and I have no illnesses at all."

Mr. Zhang also said that we Chinese have always been unable to stand up straight, but this time we have stood up straight. We Chinese usually pay two or three thousand in compensation for killing one or two Japanese, but this time we have killed twenty or thirty thousand of them. If this were in peacetime, I don't know how much compensation we would have to pay. Mr. Zhang called me to "calculate" it, saying, "I'm afraid there will be a lot of zeros."

Mr. Zhang's desk had a short scroll that he had just written, a copy of Su Changgong's "Letter from the Edge of Heaven," written "two days after Mid-Autumn Festival." Two days after Mid-Autumn Festival was September 21st, the day I arrived in Suzhou. I asked for Mr. Zhang's calligraphy, and Mr. Zhang said, "I'll give you this one as a souvenir. It doesn't have an inscription, is that okay?" I said, "It's perfect without an inscription." (Yes, it was really perfect. If someone like Mr. Zhang wrote an inscription for me and politely called me "Mr.," I would always feel ashamed.)"

So Mr. Zhang hurriedly went to get a newspaper, rolled up the calligraphy, and handed it to me.

I truly felt like I had obtained an unparalleled treasure.

### This City's Boy Scouts Released a Letter to World Boy Scouts Yesterday

We Cannot Allow the Enemies of World Culture to Run Rampant / Unite to Unleash the Power of International Children

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Boy Scouts of this city have been serving the front and rear areas, working hard. In order to urge Boy Scouts around the world to pay attention to the aggressive atrocities of the enemy army and give us active assistance, a letter to World Boy Scouts was specially released yesterday. Now we explore and record its original text as follows,

Dear Boy Scout brothers and sisters all over the world, not many days after the end of the World Boy Scout Conference in the Netherlands, a tragic human massacre unfolded in Shanghai, East Asia. The warlords of Japan, in order to satisfy their personal desires, have disregarded the wishes of the people at home and sacrificed the happiness of the people. They have brazenly launched a large-scale invasion of the territory of our Republic of China. The Chinese people are a peace-loving nation, but now, in order to fight for national freedom, to seek national equality, and to uphold world justice and peace, they have made the determination to resist to the end and no longer cherish any sacrifice to deal with the enemy. The war here has spread to all of China. We have witnessed the Japanese artillery destroy our culture, slaughter our people, and burn our houses. The human nature of benevolence seems to have been extinguished, the world's civilization seems to have died, and justice and fairness seem to have disappeared. The Chinese army has taken on the great mission of striving for the real peace of the world. We long for peace, but we do not seek false peace under coercion. We love peace, but we love even more the struggle for peace. The Shanghai Boy Scouts have risen up to do their best for the soldiers fighting for human peace and for our innocent refugees, and to engage in service work in the war zone. Boy Scout brothers and sisters all over the world, in order to uphold the dignity of our oath and unleash the power of our international children, we can no longer allow the enemies of world culture to run rampant, and we cannot allow the dehumanized militarists to be tyrannical. The Shanghai Boy Scouts have become the vanguard of the world Boy Scouts, and the Shanghai Boy Scouts are eagerly awaiting the assistance of the world Boy Scouts. Let us unite to annihilate the enemies of the world Boy Scouts.

### National Day Comfort

Various Groups Head to the Front and Rear to Extend Respects

The Shanghai Local Association believes that on the occasion of the National Day celebration and during the full-scale war of resistance, soldiers at the front and wounded soldiers at the rear should be given great comfort to show the sincerity of shared hatred against the enemy. In addition to sending a telegram to the front requesting personnel to pick up 500,000 anti-Japanese biscuits, 500,000 cigarettes, and 500 woolen vests, Yang Weiyu, Pan Yangyao, Wang Yiwu, Pan Chuitong, Ren Jinping, and others were appointed to represent the association to visit various wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai to express their condolences. It is reported that each wounded soldier will be given a sanitary shirt, a pair of socks, a towel, and a pack of cigarettes. In addition, due to the excellent service of the Boy Scouts, 300 portions of refreshments were prepared and sent to the Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps for distribution.

Since its establishment, the rescue hospital run by the Relief Committee of the Joint Charity Organizations War Zone Refugees Relief Committee has cured many wounded soldiers. There are still a few who are being treated. Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, the chairman of the association, Qu Wenliu, and the vice-chairman, Huang Hanzhi, personally went to the hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers and express their respect for their bravery in killing the enemy.

The Children's National Salvation Association prepared a large number of comfort bags filled with dry food, printed with "Return Our Rivers and Mountains," on the National Day memorial day yesterday. Four members were sent to the front line in the rain to comfort the soldiers resisting the enemy. The Drama Department was also divided into groups. Group A, including Shen Jun, Xu Xiangying, Tang Genbao, and Jiang Baisheng, went to the First Wounded Soldier Hospital to rehearse "In the Midst of Artillery Fire." Group B, including Wang Ziqing, Jiang Quqiao, Yang Bijun, and Yao Yuanyan, went to the Tenth Wounded Soldier Hospital to rehearse "Put Down Your Whip." The brave soldiers and nurses watching the play couldn't help but feel indignant and weep.

The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Industrial Circle National Salvation Association, and the National Postal Workers' Union believe that our loyal soldiers are fighting bloody battles to seek survival for the nation and justice for the world. The people in the rear should enthusiastically express their condolences to encourage morale. Therefore, yesterday, Zhou Xuexiang was recommended by the Federation of Trade Unions, Long Peiling was recommended by the Industrial Circle National Salvation Association, Shao Xubai was recommended by the Postal Workers' Union, and Zhang Kechang was recommended by the National Postal Workers' Union, to go to various wounded soldier hospitals in the city to express their condolences to the wounded and brave soldiers. At the same time, the association plans to raise funds to cast anti-Japanese commemorative medals engraved with the words "National Hero," tied with red ribbons, and distribute them to the soldiers who resisted the war as a memento.

The Relief Committee of the Shanghai Fellow Association of the Five Counties of Zhen, Dan, Jin, Li, and Yang specially appointed the vice chairman of the association, Han Jingqi, executive committee member Ma Rugen, secretary director Tang Jianhou, and staff Yue Weixian, to carry biscuits, candies, and other items to various wounded soldier hospitals to express their condolences.

In order to commemorate the National Day, the Chinese Women's National Defense Association held a joint party for various groups at its headquarters yesterday morning. At 2:00 p.m., they took towels, preserved tangerine peel, candies, anti-Japanese biscuits, and letters of condolence to various wounded soldier hospitals to express the respect of the people in the rear for the soldiers resisting the enemy.

Yesterday was Double Tenth Day. In order to create this meaningful commemoration, people from all walks of life sent comfort money and comfort goods to the Shanghai Comfort Committee for forwarding to the front. The report is as follows:

The Commercial Press stated that because National Day fell on a Sunday, it was originally scheduled to take a day off today. However, due to the severity of the national crisis, it was decided to work as usual today and send all the salary that should be compensated to colleagues for one day to the Shanghai Comfort Committee, instructing them to purchase goods to comfort the soldiers. One thousand yuan was sent in advance yesterday, and the rest will be settled and supplemented when the salary is paid.

The staff of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department specially collected 330 yuan, 0 jiao, and 7.8 fen yesterday and sent it to the Shanghai Comfort Committee, instructing them to purchase cold-proof cotton vests for comforting the soldiers resisting the enemy at the front.

The Shanghai Fellow Association of the Seven Counties of Shaoxing, considering that the soldiers at the front urgently needed cotton vests, specially made 5,000 pieces. 2,000 pieces of the finished products were completed yesterday and sent to the Shanghai Comfort Committee for inspection and acceptance, and transported to the front for application.

Mr. Guan Yuting, the manager of the Yangtze Hotel, is very nationalistic. After the August 13th Incident, in addition to spending money to purchase a large number of medicines and comfort goods to personally visit the Eighth Wounded Soldier Hospital, he also ran around soliciting donations and making his own donations, totaling 11,000 sacks, 2,000 cotton vests, and 10 new bicycles, which were sent to the Comfort Committee for transportation to the front. In addition, a large number of bicycles and running shoes are being solicited.

On the afternoon of the 9th, Binhai Middle School and the Commercial Vocational Middle School of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce solicited comfort bags from all walks of life. By midnight, 4,570 bags were obtained, and 457 yuan and 5 jiao were actually received, which were sent to the Municipal Anti-Japanese Support Association for submission to the military authorities.

The drivers of the Shanghai Automobile Drivers' Union Yunfei Automobile Company donated 236 cotton vests to the soldiers at the front because the weather was getting colder. They have been forwarded by the Shanghai Youth Wartime Service Corps.

The park friends of the Taijiquan Research Association in the French Park of this city, in order to comfort the soldiers resisting the war, specially allocated two yuan per person from this month's dinner fee to be used as comfort donations, totaling more than 60 yuan. It is heard that these people have decided that if the war of resistance does not stop, they will donate for a long time. Members of the Chinese Women's Movement Alliance have raised thousands of cotton vests. The 32nd Division of the Army received 200 pieces the day before yesterday (50 of which were donated by Qian Jianqiu). Yesterday, they received 221 cotton vests donated by the British American Tobacco Company, all of which had official receipts from the division, and received them from the association to distribute them to the patriotic soldiers to keep them warm. Yesterday, they also received 100 pieces of silk floss and cotton vests raised by Zhou Cuiying, the principal of Weifeng Girls' School, and 1,361 packages of first aid kits for military use, one package of absorbent cotton, and one package of medicine. The association is continuing to raise and produce them, and will send them to the front one after another.

### Women's Delegation Set Off Yesterday in the Rain to Present Flags to Commanders in the Front Line Area

### More Remains of Bombings Appear in Qibao Town

Ginning Mill Suffers Heavy Losses Gentry and Merchants Yesterday Gave Lectures on Air Defense

At 4:00 p.m. on the 6th of this month, enemy bombers dropped four bombs in the downtown area of Qibao Town, at the intersection of Tang Bridge and North Main Street, destroying municipal buildings and causing more than 30 casualties among the villagers. Afterwards, the town's rescue team rescued 15 seriously injured people and sent them to Shanghai for treatment, and found 13 corpses, which were buried together. It is now known that the team has been searching in the rubble for days, and has found several more bodies. There is a skull, a child's arm and a foot on the beach on the north side of the bridge, which have been buried. It is reported that two of the treated people have also died. The losses suffered by the town are difficult to estimate for a while. However, according to the observer's observation, only the Yang Dingyuan ginning mill in North Street suffered heavy losses. In view of this disaster, the gentry and merchants of the town set off in teams on Double Tenth Day to give lectures on air defense to avoid repeating the mistakes.

Current Commentary

### Britain's Attitude

— Yi

British Prime Minister Chamberlain recently delivered a speech at the Conservative Party Congress, expressing his appreciation for US President Roosevelt's views on the world situation and solemnly stating, "The British government is willing to cooperate with all countries to maintain treaties and promote peace." The two major friendly countries, Britain and the United States, in order to prevent the growth of international aggression forces, have now made a preliminary expression of their willingness to assume practical obligations for the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris. This is very inspiring for us who are suffering from aggression.

However, we must point out that there are many ambiguous places in the treaty text. Only by having all peaceful countries resolutely sanction the aggressor can the treaty have a real effect. Otherwise, the treaty will still become 'a scrap of paper,' which will only make the aggressor's arrogance even higher. From the historical facts of the past, we can find many examples.

There is no doubt that all aspects of the British government and public support our country and hate the aggressors in the Far East. However, we cannot help but wonder whether the British government has the determination to unite with other peaceful countries to jointly sanction the aggressive forces for the sake of world peace and the interests of its own future. The recent League of Nations resolution avoiding the word 'aggression,' the opposition of British public opinion (such as The Times of London, the Daily Express, the Daily Telegraph, and even the Shanghai North China Daily News) to economic sanctions, and the British government's shirk of the location of the Nine-Power Treaty conference, all these facts show that Britain is still unwilling to offend the aggressive countries and is still hesitating at the crossroads.

This traditional attitude of Britain has clearly threatened world peace, and the prestige of the American Empire has been greatly reduced. We hope that the new development of the international situation will no longer allow it to hesitate at the crossroads.

### Nanjing Road on Double Tenth Day

The Voices of the Masses Resound Through the Sky We Are an Iron Group We Must Expel the Enemy from the Country

(Special Report from This Newspaper) No Double Tenth Day has ever been as exciting as this year's! Soldiers at the front are fighting for national survival under the enemy's artillery fire: how excited are the people in the rear with their anti-Japanese sentiments, welcoming the arrival of the 26th National Day with blood-red marks. I have no better words to describe it. When the flags of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth are flying on the roofs of every household, the soul of the Chinese nation is roaring!

At 9:00 in the morning, I and a friend stepped onto Nanjing Road in the rain. The road was washed by the rain all night, almost as smooth and crystal clear as a mirror. The national flag flying in the sky, without me even looking up, its clear reflection on the road had already entered my eyes. So, this road gradually became unfamiliar to me; if it weren't for a few patrolmen patrolling the sidewalk, I would have forgotten that I was in the concession. Arriving near the throwing field, my companion first saw someone posting slogans on the glass windows of the store, "Down with Japanese Imperialism!" It exploded like a bomb in the blood vessels of every pedestrian, and immediately countless mouths shouted in different directions. Although the patrolling patrolmen followed and tore down those slogans, they were only doing it for duty reasons. As soon as the ones in the back were torn off, the ink stains in the front were posted on the glass windows again.

When the big clock on the Jianghai Customs Building struck twelve o'clock, a majestic party song was broadcast on the radio. At this time, the pedestrians on the road all stood still in the rain, and everyone solemnly followed the singing. In this majestic voice, countless strong hearts were connected together, "We are an iron group! We must defeat our only enemy!" When this voice came from behind me, a dozen Xiang Sheng cars flew to the intersection of Nanjing Road, with four or five or six people in each car. They all quickly jumped out of the carriages, and countless leaflets were distributed to people's hands. At the same time, "Arise, you who refuse to be slaves!" The March of the Volunteers was sung loudly from every corner. The junior staff in the stores held the distributed leaflets in their hands. They seemed to have no extra effort to read what was written on the leaflets carefully, and looked up, singing "Braving the enemy's artillery fire, forward! forward! forward! advance!" This lyric was really too kind to them, and how urgently they hoped to have an opportunity to melt the accumulated grief and anger into this majestic song!

Once, again... It didn't stop until someone shouted slogans. But the shout of "Down with Japanese imperialism, expel the enemy from the country! Long live the Three People's Principles! Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! Long live the Republic of China!" Responded even more strongly.

Such a generous and passionate situation is unprecedented in every mass scene. What is even more commendable is that everyone can strictly maintain order. When a dozen cars began to parade, countless crowds followed like a tide, the patrolmen were more polite in helping to maintain order, but when the car reached Chengdu Road, they were not allowed to drive westward, so the car turned south into Weihaiwei Road and left, but the pedestrians still sang the marching song and moved forward westward.

At the same time, a solemn memorial ceremony was also launched at the entrance of the Golden Grand Theater in the French Concession: at twelve noon, traffic at the crossroads was temporarily declared cut off, all vehicles stopped, and some people came out of the cars and stood on the road, singing the Party Song, the March of the Volunteers, shouting slogans, and dispersing.

We turned into a deserted road

When we came back, we saw a group of children, with the oldest one as the leader, holding a small national flag and singing the March of the Volunteers, walking out of a small alley. This is not an ordinary unconscious game for children, but a symbol of the progress of modern elementary school education.

No Double Tenth Day has ever been as exciting as this year's! (Ping)

### Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Strive to Donate to Save the Country

Shopkeepers, Vendors, and Women Actively Donate Enemy Goods Face Deserted Shops

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have been actively engaged in national salvation work. From major merchants to vendors and hawkers, everyone is happy to donate to the motherland. Their patriotic enthusiasm is no less than that of people in the country. Here is a letter from a major merchant in Southeast Asia to see the true situation.

Shop Recognition Donation

All large and small shops in Southeast Asia have recognized donations, including special donations, that is, taking out a certain amount at one time, and monthly donations, that is, bearing a certain amount each month, until the end of the war. These two types are quite considerable.

Vendors Repay

Regardless of vendors and hawkers, their patriotism is quite enthusiastic. Those who sell ice water and sweets on the road all repay with the full day's income, including capital. Most of the other fried noodle stalls and night tea places set a date to repay the entire night's business income (tea sellers have female attendants, about 40 or 50 yuan or 10 or 20 yuan per night). The fried noodle stalls repay with capital, which is quite large, about 100 or 200 yuan. Others, such as cargo trucks, various odd jobs, etc., all repay with one day's income.

Flower Girls

Maids, female students, housewives, and even prostitutes all prepare fresh flowers or paper flowers and sell them to shops or passers-by, donating the proceeds to the motherland. The above donations, in addition to the two types of special donations and monthly donations, are mostly collected by each gang through various gang guild halls and transferred to the relief committee for issuing receipts. Other repayers each have a lead box, which is issued by the relief committee. Donors throw money into the box themselves. Any size box can be obtained.

Theater Amusement

Recently, various amusement parks have opened fundraising meetings to donate to the country (various manufacturers in the park repay for the sale of goods). Thousands of people, including various opera troupes and male and female students from various schools, have participated in singing marching songs and "Anti-Japanese Songs," etc.

Collecting Old Clothes

Those who shake bells along the way and use cargo trucks to solicit old clothes pass by the store many times a day. Currently, tens of thousands of pieces have been received in the Xingbu area alone. It is heard that the first batch has been loaded. There are also many who donate original bolts of white cloth for bandaging the injured. It is heard that there are also hundreds of thousands of pieces in other ports, which will be loaded back to the country.

Japanese Shops

The shops opened by Japanese people face deserted shops. The Chinese boycott is very fierce. The sales of British and American goods have increased greatly. Craven "A" (one corner per pack) cigarettes and Electric Light brand (five cents per pack) cigarettes were originally the best-selling here. This time, rumors were spread that the company borrowed money from the Japanese, so all Malay Chinese did not smoke this cigarette. Now the company publishes newspapers every day to refute the rumors and donates a large amount of cigarettes, but it is feared that it will be very difficult to restore the previous sales. Other cases, such as Bata shoe stores, have also occurred. This shows the greatness of the power of overseas Chinese.

Chinese Shops

Chinese shops, such as those who do not donate (donate a little later), are prone to suffer a great impact on their business, because public anger is difficult to offend at present. It is heard that a Da Sanyuan cake shop, because the donation was not refreshing, the large amount of moon cakes prepared before the Mid-Autumn Festival was not sold or purchased by anyone. This kind of thing is not just one case, there are many other similar things.

### Businessmen and Merchants Unanimously Recognize Public Bonds

Nanyang Tobacco Company 250,000 Business Community General Team Continues to Raise 90,000 Yarn Industry Sub-Team 63,000

The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's main factory is located on Broadway Road. This time, the Japanese army invaded again, and the factory was the first to bear the brunt, suffering heavy losses. In addition to sending the factory's employees back with wages, the company's factories in Hong Kong and Singapore are still working hard to manufacture and continue to struggle, and in order to express their enthusiasm for saving the country, they specially recognized the purchase of 250,000 yuan of national salvation public bonds, and formulated long-term donation and salary donation methods for all employees: ㊀ Each long-term worker donates 5% of their salary in the long term, ㊁ 3/1000 of the total business volume is donated in the long term, ㊂ 10% of the food expenses are donated in the long term, ㊃ Each agency donates 2% of the commission in the long term, ㊄ The teachers and staff of each charity school donate 5% of their salary in the long term, ㊅ The students of each charity school save food and donate in the long term.

The National Salvation Public Bonds Business Community Fundraising General Team yesterday reported that the amount of public bonds raised by various industries was as follows: 32,560 yuan for the electrical appliance manufacturing industry, 27,820 yuan for the lace embroidery industry, 17,518 yuan for the hotel industry in the second batch, 6,732 yuan for the clock and watch industry, 5,435 yuan for the advertising industry, 3,950 yuan for the knitting industry, 3,900 yuan for the department store industry, 360 yuan for the pawn industry in the second batch, totaling 98,277 yuan.

The Yarn Industry Guild recently organized a fundraising yarn industry sub-team for national salvation public bonds. Since its establishment, the team members have been enthusiastic about fundraising. The current payment recognition purchase, and has been reported to the business community general team, including Nangong Mao 10,000 yuan, Yichang 8,000 yuan, Futai Qingji New Number and Yida 5,000 yuan each, Zhenda Chang 4,000 yuan, Jingfeng and Tongtai Chang 3,500 yuan each, Xin Gongmao, Hong Zhaoyao, Baofeng, and Xintai 3,000 yuan each, Cuifu 2,000 yuan, Jiukang 1,500 yuan, Hema, Qiang Maoji, Ganheng, Zhu Peiji, Shi Donglai, Yongxing, Yongxing Yuji, Rongxin 1,000 yuan each, and those below 1,000 yuan, totaling more than 63,000 yuan in national currency.

The First Special Zone Citizens' Federation of this city believes that the government is issuing national salvation public bonds to concentrate national financial resources to enrich the preparation for the war of resistance. In addition to actively fundraising in coordination with the First Special Zone group, they are now launching fundraising for national savings, which should be undertaken by every citizen, starting today, leading the sub-district associations to conduct fundraising among the citizens. The first phase plans to target 200,000 households. All executive and supervisory committee members of the association will hold a memorial ceremony this morning, and each will establish a national savings passbook to advocate for the citizens.

### Chinese and Foreign Banks Open Accounts and Interact

Facilitating the Clearing of Both Parties' Notes Mutually Sympathetic Agency Exchange

Since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai's finance has been stable as usual due to the government's effective measures and the cooperation and cooperation of the banking industry. Therefore, foreign banks have great trust in Chinese banks' notes. In addition to establishing a note exchange, they have also opened accounts and interacted with Chinese banks, forming a entrusted agency exchange, which is a new record for Chinese and foreign note exchanges in Shanghai. The New News Agency reporter recorded the various situations as follows:

Foreign Banks Set Up Note Exchange

The Bund banks have always cleared notes by sending them to each other for verification and using large drawing slips and consignment methods. There is no fixed place, but whether it is China Bank or not, it is calculated by the general summary. Although Central, China, Transportation, and China General Commercial Banks are Chinese banks, because they are located on the Bund, they also joined the foreign banks association and passed large drawing slips. Since the outbreak of the war, each bank has moved to a safe area to work according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, and is no longer on the Bund. Therefore, the foreign banks abandoned their usual large drawing slip method and sent people to meet at HSBC Bank at 11:30 every morning to check. In fact, it has become a kind of note exchange.

Chinese and Foreign Sympathetic Agency Exchange

Foreign banks have never had interbank deposit and withdrawal transactions with Chinese banks. Although the Central, China, and Transportation Banks joined the foreign bank clearing group on the Bund, they used the consignment method to clear on the same day. There is no credit relationship between each other, and there is no so-called interbank transaction. Now, since the outbreak of the war, it has also made an exception to open interbank transaction accounts with our country's banks, and we have also opened accounts with foreign banks. There are now interbank transactions between each other. Then, for all the notes receivable from each bank on the Bund, it is not necessary to collect them one by one, but they are generally deposited in the foreign bank that interacts with them. Each other is sympathetic and becomes a kind of agency exchange.

Two Groups Telegraphed to Comfort Wang Zhengting

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association jointly telegraphed to comfort Wang Zhengting, the Chinese ambassador to the United States: Ambassador Wang Rutang, I heard the voice of sympathy from friendly countries, which shows the hard work of negotiation. I respectfully express my condolences and wish you continued efforts. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association kowtow.

### The Sino-Japanese Trade Association Handles the Closure

The Small Japan Trade Association, which was initiated by Zhou Zuomin and others last year on January 27, was established to perfunctorily respond to the "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation" dreamed of by the Japanese financial community, such as Kenji Kodama. For more than a year, in addition to the usual entertainment, there was very little practical work. Recently, our full-scale war of resistance began. This kind of entertainment group has long been unnecessary to set up, so the association has been dissolved invisibly. Yesterday morning, a director of the association explained to the Huadong News Agency reporter who inquired about the association's situation: Our association severed relations with the Japanese side long before the outbreak of the war of resistance. At present, the board of directors is handling the closure and will publish a report if necessary.

### Shanghai West Boy Scout Rescue Team Recruits New Members

And Solicits a Truck

Since its establishment, the Shanghai West Boy Scout Battlefield Rescue Team has been working with great spirit in the front and rear to engage in rescue work. Under the leadership of Captain Zheng Liankun and Tao Yayu, the achievements have been remarkable. Recently, in view of the extreme need for education and care in Shanghai West, the team has re-established a sub-team near Beixinjing to facilitate work. Now the team's work is quite busy, so it wants to temporarily recruit a few new members. Those who are interested in engaging in rescue and are willing to sacrifice for the country can register at the Caojiadu Security Corps Headquarters Shanghai West Boy Scout Rescue Team Office. In addition, the team is currently short of a rescue truck (the driver's gasoline is provided by the team itself). If enthusiastic people are willing to donate or temporarily use it on a voluntary basis, they can call (20473) to notify the team and send someone to come and contact them immediately.

### Huang Youfeng's Radio Address on China's War of Resistance Against Japan

Fighting for National Survival and Upholding Righteousness for Mankind—We Will Spare No Drop of Blood to Seek a Way Out for the Nation

Mr. Huang Youfeng, former Director of the International Propaganda Department of the Central Propaganda Department, recently published a lengthy article in English, in light of the invading of our territory and the slaughter of our people by the brutal Japanese, which was broadcast externally by the Ministry of Communications Radio Station, to publicize the truth of the Japanese brutality and to call the attention of friendly nations. The article is five to six thousand words long; excerpts of its main points are translated below:

Since the revolution, China, under the leadership of a great leader, has been wholeheartedly dedicated to the construction of a democratic country, with the aim of promoting world security and commercial development. Unfortunately, this effort has been brutally destroyed by the militaristic Japanese imperialism, and the vision of the people of all countries has been obscured. Now, finally, a ray of light has emerged from the thick clouds. Our resistance for survival has aroused the sympathy and attention of the world.

We believe that militaristic nations will inevitably perish, and barbaric nations will inevitably evolve. However, it is absolutely unexpected that a civilized country with ample industry and self-proclaimed sophistication would revert to barbaric times. In the minds of the Japanese, it seems that the term "survival" does not apply to the Chinese people. If Japan succeeds in carrying out its insane militarism, the earth will be plunged into darkness, and all humanity will inevitably groan under the tips of their spears.

In the past, during the Okuma Cabinet era in Japan, twenty-one demands were made on China, attempting to use force to create an exclusive position in China. Now, the Japanese military actions in Peiping-Tientsin and Shanghai are the result of implementing its predetermined plan. Japan's intention to conquer China and make it a second Korea has long been known to the world. This attempt became even more evident during the Tanaka Cabinet. His famous Tanaka Memorial explicitly stated that Japan must first control Manchuria and Mongolia, and then proceed to seize China's resources as a basis for realizing global domination. Japan's words and deeds have never been consistent. Examples of this are too numerous to mention. When it forcibly occupied the border regions of China, it declared that it was taking peaceful steps towards China, but in reality, the opposite was true, and the oppression of force was even greater. Now, not only has it destroyed China's military key areas, but it has also arbitrarily bombed the capital and other cities. The Red Cross rescue teams, hospitals, cultural, and educational institutions, innocent non-combatants, and refugees have all been harmed. Even the British ambassador, a friend of ours, was unfortunately attacked. Even though Japan is adept at using propaganda in various countries, these ironclad facts are placed before us, and even the cleverest arguments cannot escape public opinion.

On August 28, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe declared, "In the current situation, diplomatic means cannot be used. Japan must beat China into submission so that it will no longer have the intention to fight." There is no need to say more about the value of such arrogant remarks. Facts speak louder than words. Whether bombing can deter the Chinese people's resistance, Konoe will probably understand soon. In fact, the more tyrannical Japan becomes, the faster its own destruction will be. China has long been prepared to deal with this sudden change. No matter how great its terror power is, we will certainly not easily give up peace, but when peace is truly hopeless, we will certainly not hesitate to shed the last drop of blood to seek a way out for the nation.

Japan's actions in China have already constituted a real war. All the covenants of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have been torn up, and the credibility of the signatory countries has also been tied to the execution ground. Unless the international conscience is still blinded by the Japanese militarists, there is now nothing more important than sanctioning Japan's aggression.

Eight years ago, the United States made a sharp request to the Soviet Union, asking it to explain its actions in Northern Manchuria. Now, Japan is not only doing that, but it is also producing the largest war of aggression in modern history. The Chinese people have deep trust in the United States, because the American people have always upheld justice. Since the United States has established the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty with its integrity, it must now speak out righteously and unite with all countries to implement economic sanctions against Japan. This is the only way to stop the militarism of the Japanese militarists and avoid a world war.

### Liu Ruming Expresses Gratitude to the Central Government

Liu Ruming, Commander of the 68th Army and concurrently Commander of the 143rd Division of the Army, has been reported to have been given a demerit and allowed to remain in his post by the National Government. According to a recent visitor to Shanghai from the front, a telegram was received from Liu, expressing his gratitude for this lenient punishment by the Central Government. He is currently supervising his troops to continue the war of resistance, so that he can still serve the Party and the country in a state of guilt. The battle history of the army and the circumstances of their withdrawal from Chahar Province were explained. Originally, the defense zones in the War of Resistance in Chahar were designated as follows: Nankou and Huailai were defended by Tang's army, Chaigoubao was defended by Sui's army, and the Zhangjiakou area was defended by the 68th Army. The 68th Army first recovered Chongli, then captured Zhangbei, defeating stubborn enemies each time and shooting down many enemy planes, obtaining a great deal of enemy equipment. Later, as the enemy changed its strategy, it greatly reinforced Zhangbei and sent more than 60 planes, tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, attacking Zhangyuan with all its strength. At that time, the 68th Army had been fighting for more than ten days and nights, and with a tired army, it bore a battle line of about 700 miles. All the guns and ammunition were old. Army Commander Liu personally went to the battlefield and strictly supervised his troops, determined to resist the enemy. They attacked Zhangbei three times. Our troops suffered many casualties. In the battles of Dahanuo Dam, Shenweitai, Ciershan, and Wanquan County, they gained and lost positions about twenty times. The casualties of officers and soldiers and the loss of ammunition were countless. The enemy also used airplanes and artillery to cover their advance, launching fierce attacks. Our troops could only resist with blood and spirit, pressing forward one after another. The enemy did not succeed. Just as they were requesting troops and weapons, the bad news came that the enemy had occupied Kongjiazhuang. Although our troops were in a desperate situation, they still fiercely resisted the enemy, and the situation was slightly reversed. Just as they were looking forward to reinforcements and weapons to advance and recover Zhangbei, the even worse news came that the enemy had occupied Bianhuayuan. Our army was surrounded on all sides, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Army Commander Liu had no choice but to temporarily retreat to Xuanhua with tears, vowing to defend the Yanghe River in order to recover what was lost. The army has a register of the names and native places of the wounded and killed officers and soldiers, as well as a detailed table as proof. Currently, the morale of the entire army is still extremely high. They are determined to obey the government, support the leader, resist to the end, and sacrifice to the end, serving as vanguards, killing enemies and achieving results, vowing to recover the former territory, and repay the country.

### Diary of a Military Correspondent (4)

— Chen Wanli, Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency

October 5

The usual shelling, the usual bombing of enemy and our positions on both sides of the Yunzaobang, is getting closer day by day, and the fierce bloody battle is constantly going on in the areas of Zhabei and Liuhang. Although the senior officers here are disturbed by the ringing of the telephone even in the short sleep time of only four or five hours, their spirit is still very full and strong. It is said that enemy planes often distribute Japanese newspapers in the sky above our position. These newspapers are full of news of the "Imperial Army" victory, just like delirium and dreams, because the victory or defeat of the "Imperial Army" is very clear to our soldiers on the front line. Often, the places occupied by the "Imperial Army" as described in these newspapers are also the places guarded by our soldiers on the front line.

In the silent dark night, hearing the continuous sound of machine guns and the intense light of the searchlight, we know that our air force is active in the sky above the Huangpu River. Everyone silently and remotely looks on, with infinite excitement and joy in their hearts.

October 6

Today, Liuhang is quite quiet, the fierce battle in Zhabei is still going on, and a more intense battle is unfolding along the coast of Yunzao. The attack on our position on the south bank of Yunzaobang was expected long ago, and we are waiting for it all the time. Now, the time we have been waiting for has arrived. I believe our brothers on the front line are all very happy.

In the past two days, enemy captive balloons have risen into the air on the north bank of Yunzaobang. These balloons have obviously completed their reconnaissance mission, so today, the enemy followed up with a forced crossing under the cover of artillery fire. However, until now, our loyal soldiers, braving the dense artillery fire, have given the enemy a major blow after a whole day of continuous attacks. What is the use of crossing the river? Kato Soichi, an enemy soldier captured by us in Zhabei yesterday, was escorted here today. He sat silently in the corner of the house, his face covered with a thick black beard, which could not hide the purple bloodstains on his cheeks. He hung his heavy head in frustration, thinking of his distant beloved wife and old mother. He, until he was taken prisoner, did not know why he was fighting China. Poor Japanese soldiers, poor Japanese people.

Under the flickering candlelight, I silently thought about the fate of the enemy crossing the Yunzaobang River, whether they would die in battle or become prisoners like Kato.

October 7

The battle along the Yunzaobang River is still going on fiercely. Although it is raining continuously, our soldiers on the front line are still continuing to eliminate the enemies crossing the river and prevent the enemy from continuing to cross the river. Although the rain makes it difficult to fight, after the bloody battle that has lasted for thirty-six hours, we obviously have an absolute advantage. According to intelligence, Tokyo has ordered the capture of the Songhu area before October 10 for the battle in Shanghai. October 10 is our National Day. We are now stepping on the blood of the martyrs and fighting with the enemy for survival, independence, and freedom. October 10 is only two short days away from today. The enemy's attempt has obviously become a daydream.

I would like to say to all the compatriots in the country, our Double Ten Festival will arrive in two days. Everyone, forget the current pain and have an exception for some joy. On the one hand, we celebrate our National Day, and on the other hand, we wish for the final victory.

October 8

Yesterday evening, I had an accidental opportunity to go to Shanghai, and now I have returned here. Shanghai, which is full of singing and dancing, is a bit dazzling and strange to see. Although I have only been away from Shanghai for a short ten days.

The first thing I did when I returned here was to ask about today's battle situation. I learned that the fierce battle along the Yunzaobang River is still going on, and a fierce battle will unfold in the dark night. Today, in addition to sinking many enemy ships and killing countless enemies, we also captured three.

Although the rain is constantly falling, enemy planes are still active in Zhabei as usual.

### The Enemy Who Secretly Crossed the River at Xiliufangzhai Was Completely Annihilated by Our Army

Yanjiawan, Jiangjiazhai, and Tangqiao Are in Fierce Battle and Being Cleared Along the River —The Enemy Uses Poison Gas to Hinder Our Advance—

The enemy who secretly crossed the Yunzaobang River at Yanjiawan, Jiangjiazhai, and Tangqiaozhan, southwest of Liuhang, has had half of them eliminated by our army's brave and fierce attack. The remaining enemies are stubbornly resisting under the cover of dense artillery fire from the enemy army across the river. They once again attacked our army, but after being fiercely suppressed by our army, the enemy collapsed and retreated to the riverbank, with corpses and weapons scattered everywhere. Our army bravely advanced and fought fiercely with the remaining enemies along the river. The remaining enemies stubbornly resisted with the help of enemy artillery across the river. Yesterday, our army increased its troops, and the artillery corps also became very active, counterattacking the enemy army's rear. The entire army of officers and soldiers fiercely attacked forward. Countless remaining enemies fell into the water to escape. The enemy who secretly crossed the river can be completely eliminated. Seeing that there was no way out, the enemy released poison gas to hinder our advance. Many of our soldiers were poisoned, and the progress of the entire army was hindered. However, the remaining troops continued to advance step by step, and there is no doubt that the remaining enemies can be cleared. The enemy who secretly crossed the river at Xiliufangzhai was surrounded by our army's surprise attack. The enemy repeatedly broke out of the encirclement, but could not get out, and has been annihilated by us, all shot to death by our machine guns.

### Our Army Kills the Enemy on Three Routes at Baziqiao

Fierce Attack With Great Momentum, Steadily Pressing Forward on Guangli Road

A Central News Agency military correspondent reported at 12:00 noon on the 11th that the enemy army in Jiangwan and Zhabei had been harassing us incessantly for days. In order to take the initiative, we changed from defense to offense. At 3:00 AM this morning, our army divided its troops into three routes from Baziqiao, advancing from Qujiaqiao, Guangli Road, and Yokohama Road, aiming at the Patriotic Girls' School and the No. 63 Flower Garden, launching a fierce attack with great momentum. The enemy army was extremely panicked and immediately dispatched many tanks back and forth on Jiangwan Road to block our army's advance with dense artillery fire. Our side also used flat-firing guns to concentrate firepower and continuously bombard them. The enemy tanks retreated in a hurry, but one of them was destroyed by us, trapped in the mud and unable to move. Our army on Guangli Road continued to press forward step by step, and the fierce battle stopped after an hour and a half. The enemy suffered more than 30 casualties, and we also suffered some losses. On the Dongbaoxing Road side, we took advantage of the victory last night to rush to North Sichuan Road and fought fiercely with the enemy for three hours, killing more than 60 enemies.

### Our Troops Repel the Enemy in Chongfeng on Xiangyin Road

Finally Recovering Our Original Position

A Central News Agency military correspondent reported at 10:10 AM on the 11th that the rain had subsided slightly last night, and the enemy entrenched in the downtown area braved the rain to attack fiercely along the Xiangyin Road towards our Fudan University and the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School. Our army bravely responded and fought fiercely all night. However, due to the disparity in strength, we moved back slightly. Before dawn this morning, our army took advantage of the new rain, wading through mud and braving bullets, to launch a fierce counterattack against the enemy, charging several times and finally defeating the enemy and recovering the original position. The enemy retreated in panic, leaving many corpses behind, and we intercepted many firearms such as rifles and bullets.

### Our Army in Pudong Bombards Enemy Ships

Accurately Aiming and Hitting Two Ships, the Enemy Ships Were Heavily Injured and Fled Downstream

Our army's artillery corps in Pudong once again exerted its power last night, fiercely bombarding the enemy ships in the Huangpu River. Our army aimed accurately, and two enemy ships were hit by our artillery fire, suffering heavy injuries, but because the deck had not been pierced, they were still able to move and immediately fled downstream. This morning, after the rain cleared, enemy planes hovered and reconnoitered over our army's position in Pudong, but could not find it. Starting at 8:00, our army's artillery corps fired at the Huangpu River again, and the number of shells fired was not large, but they hit several enemy ships and Hongkou positions.

In addition, it has been clearly investigated that the enemy's Yangshupu Hongda Textile Factory was hit by several shells, destroying 13 or 14 enemy military trucks. The enemy's naval wharf and the Wansui Hall on Minhang Road were all destroyed. Suffering this loss, the enemy hastily retaliated by firing artillery at us from the enemy ships in the Huangpu River. Our Pudong ×××××× and other warehouses were hit by enemy shells and are still burning this afternoon.

### Pudong After Last Night's Artillery Battle

This Morning's Investigation Shows That Our Losses Were Very Minor—Enemy Bombers Fly to Pudong Again for Reconnaissance

The entire line of Pudong, which had been silent for three days, became extremely tense again last night. Our brave artillery, following the divine power of the night of the 7th, gave the enemy another heavy blow. The sound of our heaviest artillery fire started at 7:45 PM. The enemy ships had been greatly frightened the previous time, and immediately moved one after another in front of the foreign factories and warehouses, firing artillery in retaliation. The two sides fired sometimes densely and sometimes sparsely until about 12:00 midnight, when the bombardment stopped. The enemy fired more than 300 shells, all of which landed in the distant wilderness and fields. This morning's investigation showed that only three or four civilian houses were destroyed, one water carrier died, and an old woman from Tongzhou, Li Chenshi, was injured. Our side fired fewer shells, but they landed in the enemy's positions in Yangshupu and Hongkou, causing a major threat. Several shells hit the enemy's ammunition depot, causing considerable losses. When the artillery battle was fierce, our soldiers along the entire line were on high alert at various ports to prevent the enemy from secretly crossing the river. However, the enemy ships only used machine guns to sweep the shore until dawn, and dared not attack. At 9:00 this morning, an enemy heavy bomber appeared over Pudong, but because the clouds and fog obscured the sky, reconnaissance was difficult, and it only dropped three or four small bombs in the fields, causing no losses to us. The enemy plane flew away at 10:15.

### Another Batch of Enemy Corpses Transported Away From Shanghai

The three enemy transport ships, Guangdemaru, Diyomaru, and Nagasakimaru, which arrived in Shanghai on the 10th, except for the Guangmaru, which carried a large number of enemy corpses away from Shanghai and back to Japan that afternoon, the remaining two ships are now also loading wounded and dead enemy soldiers. It is expected that they can leave Shanghai this afternoon. It is also learned that this batch of enemy corpses is being transported to Korea and Taiwan to be cremated, and then the ashes will be put into cans and transported to Yokohama for distribution to the families of the enemy soldiers.

### The Enemy Army Uses Women as Spies

Disguised as Our Soldiers to Reconnoiter Military Information—Discovered by Our Side and Shot to Death

According to Dagongshe, a member of a front-line service group who had just returned from the front told a Dagongshe reporter yesterday that in September, a soldier whose actions were suspicious suddenly appeared in our ××× position. The sentry guarding the area shouted the password, and the soldier looked panicked and intended to escape. The guard immediately shot with a rifle and the soldier fell to the ground after being shot. After inspection, it was found that the soldier was actually a Japanese woman disguised, about 18 or 19 years old, with a bun on her head. An enemy military symbol was found on her body, and it was learned that her name was Momoki Akiko. From the circumstances, it seemed that she was a female spy of the enemy army disguised as our soldier, hoping to mix into our position to reconnoiter military information. It can be said that the enemy army has exhausted its tricks by forcing its weak women to make such a meaningless sacrifice. Their downfall is not far away.

### An Outsider Arrives in Shanghai and Discusses Uprisings in Various Parts of Manchukuo

Simultaneous Responses in Shenyang and Jilin on September 11th - White Russians Suspected and Executed by Firing Squad, Key Chinese Citizens Under Surveillance

According to reports from British and American newspapers, an outsider recently arrived in Shanghai from Manchuria and described multiple simultaneous uprisings in Manchukuo and the extremely strict news censorship. He stated that residents in Manchukuo dared not discuss current affairs due to fear of the arrogant military police. Moreover, news censorship was extraordinarily strict, with only information beneficial to the Japanese side allowed to be transmitted from Manchuria. Information that was unfavorable, even if extremely important, was impossible for the outside world to know. Even if known, it would be long after the event occurred. Recently, someone using a wireless radio receiver learned of the simultaneous uprisings in various parts of Manchukuo on September 11th. However, the information was vague and impossible to verify. Later, it became known that this did indeed occur. The most intense uprising was in Shenyang. Anti-Japanese elements infiltrated the city one by one several days prior. On the morning of September 11th, they suddenly launched an attack. One team of Manchukuo soldiers stationed in the city rose up in response, killing five officers who tried to stop them. The anti-Japanese elements initially only occupied key positions, occasionally opening fire to snipe, and engaged in street fighting. Before long, their momentum grew. Military authorities realized the Manchukuo soldiers could not be relied upon, so they requested assistance from the Japanese authorities. Later, Japanese troops were dispatched from Korea. Both sides engaged in fierce combat. The rebel army was ultimately defeated due to being outnumbered and retreated into the mountains. Both sides suffered many deaths. Because the Japanese had received a tip beforehand, they were on high alert in other areas. On the night of September 11th, an uprising also occurred in Jilin. Because the Japanese were prepared, the two sides fought for a short while, with some deaths, and then it quieted down. After the Shenyang incident was suppressed, Japanese personnel found evidence on the bodies of the martyred rebel soldiers indicating that someone from the White Russian Residents' Affairs Office had secretly informed the anti-Japanese elements of Japanese military movements. As a result, several White Russians were arrested and executed by firing squad. Therefore, White Russians currently serving the Japanese are not as loyal as before. Japanese living in Manchuria are now filled with unease and are sending their families back to Japan or Dalian. They vaguely claim it is due to possible aerial attacks, but in reality, it is fear of a large-scale anti-Japanese action occurring in the future. Key Chinese citizens in Manchuria are now under strict surveillance by the police, so they are also trying to leave the country. However, Chinese citizens in the Manchukuo government cannot act freely. Even if they want to leave the country, it is impossible. If someone visits them, they are asked in detail about the topics discussed. Furthermore, Russians in Harbin are now also urgently trying to leave the country. It is said that it is impossible to live in Harbin, so several people have sold all their property at extremely low prices and are preparing to end their businesses and move elsewhere. Although the Japanese are on high alert, Manchuria is in a state of panic every day. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japanese harbor suspicions about anyone whose words and actions are not considered purely pro-Japanese. If they are considered to have dangerous thoughts, their lives are not safe.

### The Enemy's Strength Exhausted - Fifth Wave of Reinforcements Arrives

Approximately 2,000 Soldiers Landed at the Qujiang Wharf

Since the enemy began its fourth general offensive on August 28th, it has remained confined to a corner of eastern Shanghai without making any progress. The so-called plan to force our troops to retreat to the Jiading-Nanxiang line by October 10th has become a pipe dream. To attempt another counterattack, a portion of the enemy's fifth wave of reinforcements, approximately 2,000 soldiers, arrived on the giant transport ship "○regon Maru" number 186 at the Qujiang Wharf around 5:00 AM today and immediately disembarked. After the enemy troops disembarked, the ship sailed inland and is now docked at the Huishan Wharf.

### Our Artillery Team's Divine Skill Hits the Toyo Building

Japanese in Panic and Utter Confusion

Late at night last Friday, around 12:00 AM, our side and the enemy engaged in fierce artillery battles. At that time, the artillery on our right flank fired a shell that hit the middle balcony on the sixth or seventh floor of the Toyo Building on Jiujiang Road. Blocked by the thick wall, it could not penetrate but only blasted a hole in the wall. However, the Japanese police chiefs and others living there were terrified. Afterward, reporters investigated and found that the Toyo Building was a new-style eight-story building. The Japanese Club was located just across the street behind it. At the time, our artillery's target was the club, so when the shell flew through the air to the Toyo Building, it was already heading downwards. If the Toyo Building had not blocked it, the Japanese Club would have suffered significant damage. Nevertheless, our artillery's aiming was remarkably accurate, and although it did not hit the intended target, it was enough to make the enemy's heart tremble. Because our shell exploded in the Toyo Building at the time, the Japanese living in the building all rushed to the ground floor. Their panicked state was truly laughable.

### China Merchants Wharf Destroyed by Enemy Artillery

Losses of Hundreds of Thousands

The China Merchants Wharf, east of Qichang in Pudong, had more than twenty buildings. Since the outbreak of the war, it has been bombarded by enemy ships, causing extensive damage to all the warehouses. Many have collapsed. Yesterday evening around 5:30 PM, an enemy warship off the coast of Pudong fired sulfur shells directly at the wharf, four or five rounds in a row. This caused a fire inside the warehouses. Due to a large amount of grain stored there, it was easily ignited and burned until about 9:30 PM. Flames shot through the roof of the warehouse. Around 10:00 PM, five or six warehouses were engulfed in flames. For a time, the red light filled the sky, and the fire was even more intense than the previous fire at the China Cotton Corporation Warehouse. It was not fully extinguished until dawn today. The losses amount to hundreds of thousands of gold. Rumors that the Mitsui Warehouse in Pulao caught fire last night were actually a mistake, it was the Chinese Wharf.

### Eliminating the Source of Enemy Goods

Various Sectors Jointly Organize Inspection Agencies for Strict Investigation - Effectiveness Can Only Be Achieved by Simultaneously Enforcing Consular Visas

According to the New News Agency, customs statistics show that Japanese imports in August were 8,420,750 yuan, and exports of Chinese goods to Japan were 4,260,128 yuan. Although the trade figures have decreased compared to before, they still maintain a normal trade relationship. Therefore, various sectors believe that at the time of the start of the full-scale war of resistance, it is necessary to immediately sever this trade relationship. Otherwise, they are directly helping the enemy's aggressive power. A reporter from the New News Agency interviewed a prominent figure in the domestic goods industry this morning to ask for his opinion on how to eliminate enemy goods. He said, "Due to various reasons, diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not been severed even though the war has been going on for two months. This has led some merchants who do not understand the interests of the country and the nation to secretly trade with Japanese merchants for their own benefit, which is really crazy. If we want to eliminate the source, the previous boycott and inspection methods will not be effective. Because the enemy now controls areas such as Hebei, Chahar, and Shanxi in the north, and the Yangshupu area in Shanghai, enemy goods are not subject to customs inspection. They take advantage of their military power and use traitors to transport and sell them, and change the trademarks of the goods to confuse buyers. Therefore, the most effective way to eliminate the source of enemy goods is for customs to strictly enforce consular visas. Regardless of the country of origin, all imported goods must present a consular visa from the place of origin. At the same time, various industrial and commercial organizations should jointly organize inspection agencies to automatically conduct strict inspections, so that enemy goods can be eliminated and unscrupulous merchants will have no way to carry out their tricks."

### Cholera Has Abated as the Weather Turns Cooler

In addition, the Gold and Drug Bureau will continue to handle deposits, withdrawals, and payments as usual today.

### Brief Comments

— Phase

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, there have been more than ten engagement and marriage advertisements in the newspapers every day. Yesterday, on Double Tenth Festival, there was an even more spectacular showing. There were more than thirty engagement and marriage advertisements. It was very lively. Therefore, my friend said that the enemy's use of force against us this time has at least two good phenomena: one is to promote national unity, and the other is to promote family unity. This was originally a brilliant argument. Amidst the sound of artillery fire, engagement and marriage are particularly busy. Naturally, they have their reasons for being busy. I do not object to them. The ancients had the high-minded saying, "With the national crisis not yet over, how can we make a home?" I will not sing this tune for these people. I only hope that they do not forget the soldiers fighting bravely on the front lines and the distressed refugees and soldiers wounded in the rear. They should save some of the money for their weddings and make patriotic charitable acts.

### Enemy Warships Bomb Hong Kong Fishing Boats - British Government Will Seriously Intervene

Hundreds of Fishermen Are Missing - Fishing Boats Sunk and Burned - Hong Kong Authorities Report to the British Government

Hong Kong correspondence: Enemy warships have been harassing the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong for nearly a month. Although enemy soldiers have been constantly spying on various coastal areas, intending to land, they have all been met with head-on attacks by our defending troops. The enemy has not been able to achieve its ambitions. Therefore, enemy warships continue to patrol various coastal areas, wantonly harassing unarmed ships, especially harming fishermen who make a living by fishing on the sea and have no ability to resist. Their methods are extremely cruel. In the past twenty days or so, fishing boats fishing overseas from Hong Kong have been unable to avoid encountering enemy warships, being bombarded, burned, and killed by various means. Even the very few fishermen who are lucky enough to survive will be bankrupt. After these incidents occurred frequently, the Hong Kong police authorities advised Hong Kong fishing boats not to venture beyond Hong Kong's territorial waters to fish. In order to avoid danger, many fishermen have also voluntarily stopped going to sea, preferring to stop their work. However, when their hands stop, their lives are greatly affected. If this continues, it will be difficult for them to last long. Therefore, this matter has become a serious problem. The attitude of the Hong Kong government towards the infringement of Hong Kong fishing boats by Japanese warships is even more concerning to the general public. The reporter specifically visited Dr. Lo Yuk-ho to ask for his opinion. Dr. Lo replied, "Regarding the fishing boat victim incident, this issue is extremely important because it is related to Hong Kong's food and the livelihoods of over ten thousand fishermen in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government is extremely concerned about this matter, so it has already asked the British Court to seriously intervene, hoping that there will be good results soon." According to Dr. Lo, the British government authorities will make a statement soon. As for the issue of rescuing fishermen's livelihoods, it is reported that a certain fishermen's organization has prepared a plan and submitted it to the government for review. If it is deemed feasible, it will be approved for implementation, so that Hong Kong fishermen will not sit and wait for death due to the infringement of enemy warships.

Enemy warships have been bombarding unarmed fishing boats outside Hong Kong waters for days. On September 27, the German mail ship "Neuholland" rescued ten shipwrecked fishermen en route from Kobe to Hong Kong. Their fishing boats had all been sunk by enemy submarines. After the ship arrived in Hong Kong, it sent the refugees to Kwong Wah Hospital for accommodation. Among them, three had suffered injuries that had not yet healed. Each had been drifting in the water for several days, relying on holding onto planks to avoid drowning. According to one of them, Li Huahao, he was a fisherman from Hong Kong. He went out to sea to fish with his father on fishing boat number 3409. There were twelve boats in total, each carrying more than thirty people, all of whom were killed by enemy warships. Only these ten survived. They sailed to the waters near the Cape D'Aguilar Lighthouse around 9:00 AM on September 22, when they suddenly encountered an enemy submarine about 400 yards away. The submarine flew an enemy flag on its mast. After seeing them, it immediately opened fire. His fishing boat was the first to be hit and sunk. The people on board fled in all directions. At that time, the enemy warship kept firing. The accompanying boats sank one after another. One of them had been hit but was still able to sail away. The enemy warship did not notice. It was not until 3:40 AM on the 27th that they were rescued. On the 28th, a fisherman named Lin Zhu reported to the police that on the morning of the 19th of this month, his fishing boat was sailing back to Hong Kong, accompanied by eleven others. On the morning of the 30th, they encountered an enemy submarine with ten enemy soldiers on deck. They opened fire, and his fishing boat was the first to be hit and sunk, killing one boatman and injuring two others. At that time, he and nine others clung tightly to the broken boat and let it drift until they were rescued by another fishing boat in Pinghai. His nephew's fishing boat was also sunk, and all twenty-eight people on board drowned. The fishing boats and populations of others, such as Lin Fudi, were also unable to escape. The reported losses are more than ten thousand yuan per boat.

On September 24, Hong Kong fisherman Guo Zhi drove a single-masted fishing boat to fish in the Lingdingyang waters when he was suddenly forced to stop by an approaching Japanese destroyer. The destroyer lowered its launch, which sailed alongside the fishing boat. There were twenty-four Japanese naval soldiers on the launch, led by an officer. For some unknown reason, they opened fire with dozens of shots at the fishing boat from a distance of 400 yards. Fortunately, the fishermen on board quickly took cover and were not injured. After the launch docked near the fishing boat, the Japanese naval soldiers swarmed aboard, intimidating the fishermen with guns and bayonets. After thoroughly searching the entire boat and finding nothing, they threw four old-fashioned gunpowder cannons and forty pounds of gunpowder into the sea and looted the only forty Hong Kong dollars on the boat. Before leaving, they destroyed the mast and sails of the fishing boat. The unfortunate fishing boat did not repair the sails until the Japanese warship had gone far away. It hurried back to Hong Kong and reported the situation it encountered in the Lingdingyang waters to the authorities. In addition, there were four other reports to the police. The first concerned a total of ten boats that were wrecked near Waglan Island at 8:30 AM on September 23. Of all the fishermen, only thirty-two fishermen from Lin Rongsheng's boat safely arrived in Hong Kong. The rest are currently missing. The second occurred in Junk Bay, where a total of nine boats were wrecked, with approximately one hundred and fifty people missing. More than twenty people were rescued and returned to Hong Kong. The third involved the boats of the brothers Huang Demao and Huang Debao, which were wrecked in Shilou in Shanwei on the 26th, killing twenty fishermen and leaving four survivors. The fourth occurred in Jie Shi, where the number of boats wrecked at the same time is unknown. Among them, Feng Lian, the boat owner of Hong Kong fishing boat number 611HW, and twenty others, and Feng Jinsheng, the boat owner of boat number 1822HW, survived and came to Hong Kong. According to the "Gold Mountain" ship, which arrived in Hong Kong from Shan'ao on the 28th, passengers witnessed two fishing boats still burning near Cheung Chau in the vicinity of Wanshan Islands.

According to news from the "Hong Kong Telegraph," enemy submarines have destroyed many fishing boats recently, some of which are registered in Hong Kong. Therefore, it is not difficult to cause political negotiations. The newspaper also quoted sources from the government as saying that the Director of Marine, Mr. Newboult, has reported all the circumstances of the fishing boat disasters to the British government. People in the Colonial Secretary's Office said that although it is difficult to predict what steps the government will take now, they believe that the Hong Kong government will forward the report to the British Foreign Office and ask for instructions on how to respond.

### Enemy Planes Repeatedly Harass Taicang

Drop Bombs in Luhe Town - Dozens Killed and Injured

Taicang correspondence: On the evening of the 5th of this month, around 10:00 PM, two Japanese planes scouted along various seaports until 1:00 AM.

At dawn on the 6th, three Japanese planes scouted various towns and villages in the county.

Around 8:00 AM on the 6th, when villagers in Luhe Town, in the fourth district of the county, happened to be going to market, two Japanese planes flew over the sky. After scouting for a week, they dropped four bombs in the crowded people. The villagers had nowhere to escape, resulting in seven deaths and dozens of injuries. Blood and flesh flew everywhere, a very tragic scene. More than thirty residential houses were also destroyed.

Zhangjiashi and Hengtangshi in Kunlian, Changshu County, which borders this county, were also bombed by Japanese planes with more than ten bombs at the same time, killing more than thirty people and injuring dozens. Many houses were destroyed.

Around 1:00 PM, Japanese warships from Yanglinkou again bombarded heavily with dozens of shells.

Wartime Youth, Issue 10

### To the Youth

— Lao Yu

Youth is the cornerstone of the country and the lifeline of the nation! Therefore, they occupy a very important position in the entire nation. Today, when the survival of the country and the rise and fall of the nation are decided in an instant, the responsibility of the youth is of course even greater!

A full-scale war of resistance has begun. If we do not serve the country and society now and rise up to participate in the work of resisting the enemy, then if the country is destroyed, I am afraid that it will be impossible to contribute to the country, right?

Youths! Rise up! Quickly dedicate our skills and unleash our strength to serve the country; dedicate everything we have to the country to consolidate the front of the War of Resistance!

We must remember that this war of resistance is a war of resistance for the entire nation and a war of resistance for all mankind. For the sake of the country, for the sake of the nation, and for the sake of mankind, we must strive for "the final victory."
