### Fierce Battles All Day on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, We Recapture Yu Family Residence and Advance Victoriously

We Launched a Fierce Attack on the Enemy at Gejia Archway with Considerable Success - Our Troops Launched a Counterattack Yesterday Along Sanmin Road, Approaching the City Center - Enemy Warships at Liu River Bombed by Our Air Force, Shells Hit and Caught Fire

The bloody battles on both banks of the Yunzaobang River have been unfolding extremely fiercely for the past two days. The enemy's dreams of peeking into Nanxiang and invading our Dachang have not yet been shattered. After being forced to the riverbank by our forces, the enemy south of the Yunzaobang has launched fierce breakouts for the past three or four days, attacking our army's positions north of Dachang. The enemy at Hei Dahhuang Residence, Zhu Family Residence, Shenjiawan, Qiangmentou Residence, and other locations fiercely attacked our army's positions near Fengcun Tangqian last night. The enemy artillery隊at Liuhang also fired at the same time, covering the enemy's advance. Our troops bravely fought back, pressing forward despite casualties, but eventually the fortifications were damaged, allowing the enemy to cross Fengcun Tang and infiltrate the area around Bashiqiao Residence, gathering two kilometers north of Dachang, near the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, at Maqiao Residence and Gejia Archway, about one kilometer west of Maqiao Residence. A bloody battle, unprecedented in scale, ensued between the enemy and our forces. A large force of our fresh troops rushed to support yesterday morning and charged forward, while troops from Chenjia Residence moved to support the flanks. The bloody battle lasted until yesterday evening, when the enemy was unable to withstand it and retreated, and Yu Family Residence, northwest of Maqiao Residence, was recovered. However, the enemy still lingered. At Maqiao Residence, Yu Family Residence, Gejia Archway, and other locations, our troops counterattacked last night, engaging in a bloody battle throughout the night. Both sides suffered extremely heavy losses. As of the third hour of today, the situation remains at a standstill amid intense fighting. As for the north bank of Yunzaobang, the enemy southeast of Guangfu fiercely attacked our army's Chenjiaxiang position, attempting to break through to Nanxiang, but was repelled by our troops. They are still stubbornly resisting there. Our fresh troops have arrived to reinforce and encircle the enemy, and a resolution is expected. Miaohang was relatively quiet yesterday. At Jiangwan and Zhabei, there were only minor skirmishes.

A Central News Agency war correspondent with the army at Jiangwan reported at 11:30 PM on the 18th that the loss of Gejia Archway yesterday was a result of our Qin Regiment dying with their positions, making a heroic sacrifice. However, the enemy also suffered heavy casualties, and their momentum has been blunted. Moreover, being a lone force that has ventured deep, they dare not advance rashly again. Starting at dawn today, the enemy again attacked east along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, attempting to expand their positions and use the highway to directly attack Dachang. Therefore, fierce battles took place on the highway throughout the day. Our stronghold at Yu Family Residence was lost and regained and advanced victoriously, gaining a considerable advantage. However, in the Gejia Archway area, the enemy, after a day of deployment, attempted to move again in the evening. Our troops kept a close watch on them. As of the time of the report, our troops had received orders to counterattack, with the left and right flanks closely coordinated with the front, launching a fierce attack on the enemy, which was quite successful.

### Enemy Troops Attacking Yu Family Residence in Southern Yunzao洪were Repelled

A Central News Agency war correspondent with the army at Jiangwan reported at 10:00 PM on the 18th that the enemy on the south bank of Yunzaobang continued to attack southward, resulting in fierce battles for three days. Both sides suffered significant losses. Starting at dawn today (i.e., the 18th), the enemy switched to using heavy artillery to bombard our entire south bank line fiercely, and enemy aircraft also came in large numbers, dropping many bombs along the Zhen-Da Shanghai-Taicang Highway. The rumbling sound never stopped throughout the day. At dawn, the enemy, whose troops at Gejia Archway were under considerable threat from our army on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, immediately shifted their troops east and launched a fierce attack on our Yu Family Residence position. Our troops bravely fought back, vowing to defend their territory to the death. However, due to the intense and unusual ferocity of the enemy aircraft and artillery, they suffered heavy casualties and were forced to retreat to the east of the highway. At 9:00 AM, our reinforcements arrived and joined the counterattack, launching multiple assaults. The enemy stubbornly defended their position. At about 2:00 PM, our troops launched a flanking maneuver from Chenjia Residence, attacking the enemy's left side. Although the enemy was tenacious, they were eventually unable to withstand our pincer attack and retreated. Our troops then recovered Yu Family Residence at about 4:00 PM. The enemy, however, still lingered in front of our position, refusing to leave. As of the time of the report, fierce fighting was still ongoing. Also, the enemy near Hei Dahhuang Residence also attacked eastward once at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, but there were only about a hundred of them, so they retreated after being intercepted by our forces. West of the highway, a portion of the enemy also attacked our Zhang Yu Residence and Zhou Cheng Residence positions in the morning, but they were also repelled by our forces. At present, a large number of our reinforcements have arrived to replenish our forces, waiting for an opportunity to launch a full-scale counterattack.

### An Unprecedented Bloody Battle Between Our Enemy West of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway in Southern Yunzao Tears

Our Qin Regiment Entirely Sacrificed Heroically - Enemy Troops Suffered More Than Three Thousand Casualties

According to Central News Agency, the enemy west of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway on the south bank of Yunzaobang, unwilling to accept their crushing defeat on the 12th, reorganized their remaining forces and launched a large-scale re-attack to the southeast starting on the night of the 14th. Our troops, on the other hand, held key positions west of the Shanghai-Taicang Road and on the north bank of Fengcun Tang, calmly responding to the enemy. Thus, a bloody battle unfolded in an area 1,400 meters deep and 2,400 meters wide, south of Yunzaobang and north of Fengcun Tang, with both sides engaging in a full-force grapple, raging for three days and nights, and still continuing to this day. According to a report from our Central News Agency war correspondent with the army at Jiangwan at 11:00 AM this morning, the battle situation is as follows:

Enemy Troops Fiercely Attack Gejia Archway

Under the cover of their intense artillery fire, the enemy gradually advanced and gathered in the Bashiqiao Residence area. Starting at dawn yesterday, they again concentrated heavy artillery fire on the Gejia Archway area. At the same time, more than 20 aircraft continuously dropped bombs. A large force of enemy troops, led by multiple tanks, charged at our positions. Our troops, under the command of Regiment Commander Qin Qingwu, bravely fought back. At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, our Regiment Commander Qin took the lead and, unfortunately, was hit by a stray bullet. His subordinates urged him to retreat to the rear for medical treatment, but Regiment Commander Qin firmly refused, vowing to live and die with the position. The entire army was moved and morale was greatly boosted. They immediately charged out of the trenches, attacked the enemy, and fought them hand-to-hand. The enemy suffered casualties everywhere, and we also suffered significant losses.

The Entire Qin Regiment Sacrificed Heroically

The fierce battle lasted until 5:00 PM. The entire Qin Regiment, from Regiment Adjutant Zhang Jilin, Ou Xin, and Battalion Commander Liu Yan競 downwards, made heroic sacrifices. Only Regiment Commander Qin and 12 others remained, still holding the position under artillery fire, awaiting reinforcements to counterattack. However, because enemy aircraft were constantly harassing and refusing to leave, reinforcements could not be brought up, and the enemy army continued to attack, causing the remaining 12 of us to die with our position. Gejia Archway also fell into enemy hands.

Our Forces Launch a Large-Scale Counterattack

At 6:00 PM, as dusk fell, a large force of our reinforcements arrived and immediately launched a counterattack. The enemy's position was not yet stable. After our fierce attack, the enemy retreated in less than two hours. Our troops recovered Gejia Archway. However, the enemy continued to attack, advancing and retreating multiple times. After midnight, we temporarily retreated to the Huli Residence, Huangjia Alley, and Chenjia Residence area, awaiting an opportunity to counterattack. Today, the enemy aircraft and artillery continue to bombard us. However, there has been no contact between the troops. The fierce battle lasted 24 hours without pause. Although our side suffered great sacrifices, with the entire regiment of 1,400 officers and soldiers dying with their position, the tragedy was unprecedented. However, the enemy suffered more than three thousand casualties, with corpses covering the fields and ditches stained red.

### Our Forces Punished the Stubborn Enemy in the Fierce Battle at Chenjiaxiang

More Than Sixty Enemy Soldiers Abandoned Their Weapons and Returned - Only a Few Escaped the Encirclement

On the south bank of Yunzaobang, another fierce battle broke out on the night of the 14th. The enemy poured all their strength into the attack, while our troops fought to the death to resist. The intensity of the battle was no less than that of the Battle of Shishan. By yesterday morning, both sides had suffered heavy casualties, so the battle temporarily came to a halt. According to military sources, the most intense fighting took place on the approximately 600-meter line between Chenjiaxiang and Dunwu Temple on the north bank and at Qiangmentou Residence on the south bank. Starting in the afternoon of the 13th, the enemy used a division of troops to attack this line. Our troops held the line east of Chenjia Residence in front of Dunwu Temple. As soon as the outposts made contact, the fierce battle began. The enemy's attack was fierce. In order to avoid heavy casualties, our troops slightly withdrew the frontal units, but both wings remained in their original positions, forming an encirclement. The enemy, seeing us retreat, was overjoyed and rushed forward. We waited for them to rush past, then encircled them from both wings, cutting off their retreat. The frontal units also returned and counterattacked. The enemy, seeing the situation, knew they had fallen into a trap and lost their bearings, becoming extremely panicked. Our troops, with magnanimity, urged them to surrender. More than sixty people abandoned their weapons and returned. Our troops comforted them and escorted them to the rear. The rest were still fighting like cornered beasts. Our troops, seeing that the enemy was so stubborn, ordered an encirclement and severely punished them. Only a few escaped the encirclement.

A Central News Agency war correspondent with the army at Guangfu reported at 9:50 AM on the 18th that a regiment of enemy troops was stationed in the Yangjia Residence and Peng Residence area, about 1.5 kilometers southeast of Guangfu and northwest of Chenjiaxiang. Yesterday (the 17th), they were suppressed by our forces, and the enemy suffered heavy losses, with few remaining. The enemy then reinforced the area with about several hundred people, so fierce fighting broke out again at night. As of the time of the report, the situation was still at a standstill. Our troops have a considerable advantage.

### Our Forces Launched a Counterattack Along Sanmin Road, Already Approaching the City Center Area

A Central News Agency war correspondent with the army at Jiangwan reported at 1:50 AM on the 19th that our troops in the Beiji Residence area launched a counterattack eastward along the north side of Sanmin Road at 7:30 PM last night. The enemy outposts retreated after being pressured by our forces. We then advanced to Yangjia浜Residence, crossed the Songhu Road, and reached Huoshaoxiang, already approaching the city center area. At 11:00 PM, enemy reinforcements rushed to the scene. Our machine gun隊发挥 its power, charging relentlessly. The enemy counterattacked with the small cannons of their tanks. As of the time of the report, fierce fighting was still ongoing.

### Our 室 Army Bombed Enemy Warships at Liu River Yesterday

Three or Four Ships Hit and Caught Fire

A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 18th reported aviation news that several enemy warships and transport ships suddenly docked successively in the area east of the Liuh River mouth on the 18th, with some intent. Two teams of our air force went to severely attack them at 6:00 PM on the 18th. When our air force arrived over the Liuh River mouth, the enemy began to realize it and frantically fired anti-aircraft guns and cannons. Our aircraft calmly entered the formation and concentrated their bombs on the enemy warships and transport ships, dropping them accurately. Instantly, three or four ships exploded, with flames soaring into the sky. Our air force, having completed their mission, returned safely together.

### Artillery Battles Erupted in the Huangpu River Yesterday Afternoon

Three Shells from Our Forces Struck the Enemy's Position

At about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, two enemy gunboats anchored at the No. 11 buoy in the Huangpu River and one gunboat at the No. 16 buoy suddenly fired again at Pudong. Our artillery positions in Pudong, not willing to be outdone, immediately launched a fierce counterattack. For a time, the rumbling sound shocked the entire city of Shanghai. The fighting stopped at about 3:00 PM. The enemy's position behind the Minghua Sugar Factory was hit by three shells and burned for two hours before gradually extinguishing.

### Miaohang's Northeast Sides are Peaceful

Our Troops Once Launched an Attack and Killed the Enemy - The Enemy's Attack on Zhabei and Jiangwan was Thwarted

A Central News Agency war correspondent with the army at Jiangwan reported at 10:00 PM on the 18th that the east and west sides of Miaohang were peaceful throughout the day. However, the troops at our Xi Yan Zhongqiao Residence once launched an attack on the enemy at Dong Yan Zhongqiao Residence. After our fierce charge, they broke into their warning line, killing many enemies and seizing more than a dozen rifles, before retreating to their original position.

A Central News Agency war correspondent with the army at Jiangwan reported at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon that at 6:30 PM the night before, about three companies of enemy troops in the Aiguo Girls' School area on Jiangwan Road began to move. Our troops, having learned of this, actively prepared for defense. At about 2:00 AM this morning, the enemy indeed divided their forces into two routes. One route, consisting of about two companies, advanced towards our Jiejiabridge, Guangzhong Road, and Chih Chih University area. Before the enemy approached, our troops used mortars and shrapnel to bombard them fiercely. For a time, the rumbling sound shocked everyone far and wide. After more than two hours of bloody fighting, more than seventy enemies were killed. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. At about 4:00 AM, we used a small team to attack the enemy position at Aiguo Girls' School. After being attacked, the enemy did not dare to attack and was extremely uneasy when attacked by us. Another route of enemy troops, consisting of about one company, attacked our position from the Sichuan Highway. Our troops, having prepared early, waited for the enemy to approach before leaping out of the trenches to give the enemy a painful blow. After more than an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy again retreated to their original position. In this battle, more than thirty enemies were also killed.

Before dawn yesterday, as two companies of enemy troops were advancing towards our position in the Dongbaoxing Road area, our air force made a night raid on Shanghai and happened to pass by the area, discovering the activities of the enemy soldiers. They then flew low together and took turns dropping more than a dozen bombs. At the same time, our troops also used mortars and shrapnel to bombard them fiercely. The two enemy companies were almost completely annihilated. At dawn yesterday, there were more than a hundred enemy corpses on the opposite bank of the Baoshan Paper Mill that had not been dragged away, it was said.

Late the night before, our troops on the Fudan University side took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness and launched a sudden fierce attack. At that time, the enemy soldiers were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. Many of them died under our troops' knives and guns. At about 4:30 AM this morning, the enemy received reinforcements and reorganized their remnants, attacking our newly established strongholds. At that time, our troops used dense machine gun fire to strafe the enemy. The enemy stubbornly tried to resist, but after our troops bravely suppressed and annihilated them, they were defeated and retreated. The enemy suffered dozens more casualties. By 9:00 AM yesterday morning, our troops, seeing that the new stronghold was too large a target and easily subject to air strikes, returned to their original position and held it firmly. The enemy did not dare to attack again.

A Central News Agency war correspondent with the army at Zhabei reported at 1:50 AM on the 19th that at 8:00 PM last night, our troops, based on reconnaissance reports, believed that the enemy on North Sichuan Road had a major plan. Our troops immediately ordered a strict alert. However, as of the time of the report, the intersection of Guangdong Street and Dongbaoxing Road was as silent as death, and no enemy troops were seen attacking. However, west of the Yokohama River, ten enemy tanks drove along Dixiwei Road towards the enemy headquarters. The sound of the vehicles broke the eerie atmosphere. At the Baziqiao side, the sound of gunfire was particularly dense. About two companies of enemy troops attacked from the No. 63 Garden at 8:00 PM. The artillery fire from their tanks was very fierce, advancing along the Yokohama River. Our troops braved the rain of bullets and counterattacked, resolving the enemy outposts. The enemy's main force rushed from behind, and a bloody battle began. However, our positions were solid, and the enemy did not advance an inch in the end, retreating quietly at midnight.

### Our Air Force Displayed Its Power

Bombing the Enemy's Position at Luodian

According to Central News Agency, our Central News Agency war correspondent with the army at Guangfu reported at 9:50 AM on the 18th that at about 2:00 AM this morning, several of our aircraft flew in from the southwest and dropped several large bombs in the enemy's position north of Luodian, all of which landed near the enemy's artillery positions, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. After completing their mission, the aircraft safely flew eastward. When our aircraft came to attack, the enemy ships used searchlights to illuminate them, and the anti-aircraft guns fired like a string of pearls. The reporter, leading the way and looking east from the front line, saw the electric torches like rainbows hanging in the sky, and the bullets flying up and down like meteors. The sight was very magical.

Destroyed a Large Field Gun

According to Central News Agency, most of the enemy's army artillery is deployed in the Yangshupu area in the eastern district of the concession, using foreign property as cover to continuously fire at our positions in Pudong and Zhabei. At 6:00 PM on the 16th, the enemy used a very large field gun to frequently bombard Zhabei. The loud noise was shocking and different from the navy's cannons. At midnight, our air force came to attack, detected its exact location, and dropped several large bombs, destroying it. Therefore, from midnight onwards, the area became silent and the sound of the large gun was no longer heard.

Enemy Airfield Damaged

According to investigations by Central News Agency reporters, in addition to one enemy warship being hit by one of our bombs and fleeing to Songkou for repairs, the enemy barracks at No. 525 Ningguo Road were bombed and caught fire, completely destroyed. In addition, within the Huishan area, five of our bombs were dropped, and several bombs were dropped on the Gongda Cotton Mill at the end of Yangshupu Road and near Jungong Road, making loud noises. The enemy's temporary airfield and aircraft warehouse were heavily damaged.

### The First Batch of the Enemy's Sixth Reinforcements Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Since the enemy started their fourth general offensive on the 28th of last month, not only have they made no progress, but they have also repeatedly encountered fierce resistance from our troops. The extent of their casualties is unprecedented. The enemy troops in Shanghai now have no fighting spirit. Therefore, the enemy was forced to make a sixth plea for reinforcements from the country. According to reliable sources, Tokyo has decided to transfer one brigade each from the 3rd and 6th Divisions, one division from the 15th Division, one brigade of three regiments from Cheng Guorui's unit of the puppet Manchukuo army, and one brigade from the Taiwan Army to Shanghai as the sixth reinforcements. The first batch of more than 3,000 people arrived in Shanghai at about 7:00 AM yesterday, transported by the enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships Nachi Maru and Takao Maru. After the enemy troops landed, the two ships sailed inland. Currently, Nachi Maru is docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Zhongzhan, and Takao Maru is docked at the No. 15 buoy.

(Central News Agency) At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, another enemy transport ship, Nojima, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Beizhan, carrying a large number of enemy aircraft parts. In addition, among the enemy transport ships anchored in the Huangpu River, in addition to the two that carried enemy reinforcements to Shanghai yesterday morning, there was also the No. 82 transport ship Zhuji Maru, which was unloading horse feed at the Huangpu Wharf, the No. 619 transport ship Dongji Maru, which was unloading machine gun ammunition at the Osaka Wharf, the transport ship Eo ima, which was unloading fuel and bombs at the China Merchants Bureau's Beizhan, and the Nagasaki Maru, which was unloading gun and artillery ammunition at the Huishan Wharf.

### Special Envoy Vice President Kong, Who Attended the Coronation of the British King, Returns Home

His Inspection in Europe and America Was Warmly Welcomed by Various Countries - On His Way Home, He Met with the British Ambassador in the Philippines to Offer His Regards

Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was ordered in early summer of this year to represent our country in attending the coronation ceremony of British King George VI in England. After completing his duties in London, he also went to various countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and the United States to inspect economic construction, lasting six and a half months. Wherever he went, he was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in the friendly nations. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he originally planned to return home immediately. However, upon receiving the Central Government's order, he had some contacts in Europe and America. It was not until the 24th of last month that he boarded the Victoria passenger ship in Italy to return home. On the 10th of this month, the ship passed through Singapore, where the local overseas Chinese gave him an unprecedented grand welcome. When he arrived in Manila on the 13th, Philippine President Quezon insisted on hosting a banquet and held a grand welcome. He also heard that British Ambassador Hugo von Knatchbull-Hugessen was recuperating in Southeast Asia, so he went to meet him. The next morning, he transferred to the Hong Kong Clipper airplane and arrived in Hong Kong at 4:00 PM. He originally planned to transit through Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei from Hong Kong, inspecting the situation in various provinces along the way, and return to the capital by a roundabout route. However, after receiving an urgent telegram from the Central Government in Hong Kong, he changed his route and boarded the French postal ship Lussor to Shanghai, arriving at the Wusongkou at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The French consul personally went to greet him by small boat. At 4:50 PM, he landed at the French Avenue Wharf. Mayor Yu, Commander Yang, Director Cai, and financial leaders of the city such as Du Yuesheng, Xu Kan, Chen Hang, Song Zi Liang, and Qian Xin Zhi, along with more than a hundred others, went to the wharf to greet him. The French Concession's chief inspector also led a police隊 to line up and welcome him. Vice President Kong stepped ashore, expressed his gratitude to the welcomers, and then transferred to his own car to return to his residence. At that time, the Bund area was heavily guarded, and traffic was temporarily cut off. Upon hearing the news, the reporters went to the residence to pay their respects. He was kind enough to receive them, but because of the long journey, he was quite tired, and there were many guests. The reporters exchanged a few words of greetings and received an invitation to talk in detail the next day before taking their leave. It is said that Kong will rest in Shanghai for a while before entering the capital to report on his mission.

### Map of the War Zone Situation at Gejia Arch Residence, Miaoji, and Guangfu

### A Night Record from the Military Camp (Part 1)

Z> Huai Qing

The sky was densely covered with layers of clouds, and the moon shone weakly through the gaps. The night was hazy and the surroundings were vast and boundless. Leaving the crisscrossing fields and horse paths, one suddenly felt as if they were in the middle of a boundless ocean. The greatness of nature further highlighted the insignificance of mankind.

The sound of gunfire was dense and clearly audible. The executioner of mankind was displaying its cruel acts of aggression and slaughter. Our loyal and brave soldiers were fighting a bloody war for the sake of human justice. Suddenly, several loud cannon blasts erupted nearby. A companion said, "Those are our cannons." There was a clear sense of excitement in his tone.

We arrived at our destination.

A senior officer had already sent his subordinates to greet us. We were led into a room, which was the headquarters of the ×× Army, commanding tens of thousands of troops and making strategic plans. There was a small rectangular table covered with kraft paper, with narrow benches on either side, and two old armchairs at the ends. A luxurious large serving tray served as an extension. Two Western candles were stuck on the bottom of cigarette tins on the table. In the center, ten tin "Western bowls" were neatly arranged in a long row. At the corner was a clumsy teapot, keeping a tin kettle of boiling water warm. Several dishes of Western pastries, bananas, apples, fresh pears, preserved tangerine peels, candies, etc., were temporarily brought out. If it weren't for the cannon fire outside, it would have been easy to imagine being in a story from "Arabian Nights."

"The Commander and Chief of Staff have gone to the front lines for inspection and haven't returned yet. They should be back soon. I'll entertain you on their behalf. The conditions here are not ideal, please forgive us for any inconvenience," Secretary Qiu said with a series of polite remarks. Director Lu then went to the tea area to call the Commander.

Secretary Qiu held the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was of medium height, with a thin face and wore a pair of nearsighted glasses. He spoke with a distinct Zhejiang accent and was a very eloquent speaker. He reported the progress of the battle in a constant stream of words.

"This entire frontline is under the responsibility of our army. The fortifications are very solid. The Commander personally inspects and urges the frontline day and night, not daring to slacken in the slightest."

"When we were at ××, the enemy army landed due to a map error, and fierce battles lasted for several days and nights, resulting in significant losses. First, the enemy warships' artillery fire was concentrated on a stronghold for bombardment. At the same time, a large number of aircraft dropped bombs from the sky to cover the infantry landing. At that time, our troops had to lie low in the trenches and calmly respond. As soon as night fell, we jumped out of the trenches, concentrating our firepower to attack the enemy on one hand, and launching bayonet charges on the other, driving the enemy back to their warships. When dawn broke, the enemy came again. We advanced and retreated like this, fighting fiercely for a whole week. Although our sacrifices were great, their casualties were even more severe."

"In modern warfare, there is almost no distinction between officers and soldiers. Officers must lead by example. Only then can their subordinates be willing to charge forward with their lives. Strict military discipline is absolute. Otherwise, no matter the rank of the officer, how can they mobilize the entire fighting force of their subordinates? Moreover, officers at most carry a pistol and only have a command sword. If military discipline is not strict and orders are disobeyed, every soldier can rebel against you and kill you. Therefore, everything depends on regular training. 'Attention' and 'At ease' are certainly the simplest actions, but they contain great significance. They always make soldiers eliminate all distractions and uniformly obey orders without the slightest resistance. Over time, a force of hundreds of millions can naturally be commanded with ease, and they will uniformly risk their lives and shed blood on the battlefield."

"Every soldier cannot have any distractions during combat. If he thinks about the happiness of his family or the danger to his life, then his mind will already be weak, and he will no longer have the courage to charge. Veteran soldiers don't have this phenomenon, and they all know when to take cover and when to fire their guns. Given the opportunity, they will naturally act in unison. This is all 'experience,' and it can never be achieved by the commander's orders. New recruits are different. Therefore, the combat effectiveness of new recruits is far inferior to that of veteran soldiers." The more we listened, the more interesting it became. Secretary Qiu spoke eloquently, with a slight coughing sound from a lingering cold, but his eloquence only increased.

"Then how do they eat and sleep in the trenches?" We consciously raised such an interesting question.

### No Intense Battles on Various Lines in North China

Enemy troops bombard our positions at Xinkou. Our troops cross the Tuhai River on the Jinpu Line.

[Nanjing] According to a long-distance telephone call from Taiyuan, which is considered reliable by foreigners, all fronts in North China are quiet today. After fierce battles in the past few days, both Chinese and Japanese troops are exhausted and need to rest and await reinforcements. The Japanese troops fighting in the plains area are the Second, Third, Fifty-third Divisions, and one brigade of "Manchukuo" soldiers. Four brigades of fresh troops will soon arrive as reinforcements. The Japanese troops use heavy artillery fire in the plains to block the advance of the Chinese army, but the Chinese army finally captured 800 Japanese rifles, 100 light machine guns, 10 field guns, and more than 30 tanks. Yesterday, a Japanese heavy bomber was shot down on the Yuanping battlefield. The Japanese aircraft mistakenly identified the Chinese army positions south of Yuanping as Japanese positions and dropped cigarettes, food, and ammunition, landing behind the Chinese lines. At the same time, the situation at Niangziguan is now looser. There are no changes on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines. The Chinese army on the Pinghan line is defending the positions south of Gaoyi, while the Chinese army on the Jinpu line is in the Yucheng area. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

[Taiyuan] A certain division of our army obtained a copy of the map of "Greater Manchukuo" and "North China" in the Battle of Huaihua in southern Xinkou, which contains very detailed military deployments. It is estimated that on the Jinpu line, there are the 10th and 16th Divisions, on the Pinghan line, there are the 6th, 14th, and 23rd Divisions, and on the PingSui line, there are the 5th Division and the Sakai Brigade. (Central News Agency, 18th)

[Taiyuan] Frontline telegrams: ① On the Xinkou front, on the morning of the 18th, enemy artillery heavily bombarded our Jiehepu positions. In the Yongxing Village area on the left flank, enemy tanks were very active. Our troops are more rigorously deployed in all directions, and the positions are solid, meeting the invading enemy with a head-on blow. The enemy suffered setbacks and dared not advance. As of noon, they were still in a stalemate. ② The enemy in Shuoxian City is said to have retreated towards Mayi (southwest of Shanyin and northeast of Shuoxian). (Central News Agency, 18th)

[Taiyuan] Our army has been engaged in bloody battles with the enemy in the Xinkou area for several days and has seized many spoils of war, including 500-600 rifles, more than 40 light and heavy machine guns, 20 artillery pieces, and 2 radio stations. On the 17th, a Japanese heavy bomber was shot down near Qicun Town, Xinxian County. The aircraft can accommodate more than ten people and is worth about 500,000 yuan. According to officers returning from the front, the enemy's method of combat in Xinkou this time is extremely clumsy. At the beginning of their offensive, they must first bombard indiscriminately with artillery fire, with dozens of rounds fired every minute. Enemy planes also drop bombs indiscriminately. Such intensive bombardment lasts for several hours or all day. Their consumption of ammunition is impossible to estimate. Now the enemy is firing indiscriminately, and because our guerrilla forces are scattered behind enemy lines, constantly damaging their communication lines, they are having trouble with supplies and are very panicked. They have no choice but to use airplanes to transport food and ammunition, but because the throwing is inaccurate, much of it falls into our positions. Their predicament is now fully exposed. (Central News Agency, 18th)

[Jinan] Our army crossed the Tuhai River yesterday morning and arrived at Maojiayuan, 12 miles north of Yucheng, where they engaged in fierce battles with the enemy. The enemy's main force, consisting of 2,000 infantry and artillery units, was reinforced from Jianjizhai, and they fought fiercely in the area south of Beiqiu. At this time, our strong troops also arrived and launched a pincer attack from the rear, engaging in several melee combats, killing many enemies. The enemy then collapsed and retreated. Our guerrillas are also currently engaged in fierce battles with the enemy northwest of Lingxian. Two columns of enemy armored vehicles, which were previously located 15-16 miles north of Pingyuan, were destroyed by our pre-set landmines, and enemy armored vehicles have not been seen since. There are approximately 5,000 enemy troops south of Dezhou, including puppet troops such as Li Shouxin. (18th Special Dispatch)

### Enemy Planes Active Again Yesterday, Bombing Without a Day's Break

Inhuman Acts Unmatched in the World; Slaughter of Civilians Condemned by All Mankind

Yesterday morning, starting at dawn, over thirty enemy planes took off from the enemy's temporary airfield at the end of Yangshupu Road. After circling over the city several times, they dispersed to the suburbs to continue their bombing. The details are as follows:

Western Shanghai

Around 7:00 AM this morning, three enemy planes circled and reconnoitered over the Fanwangdu area in western Shanghai. They then dropped multiple bombs near Zhongshan Road, destroying several civilian houses. Afterwards, a large number of absurd leaflets were scattered. Our residents all understand the enemy's intentions and paid them no heed. At 10:50 AM, these three planes flew south along Zhongshan Road, Jibiegen Road, and dropped six bombs on Hongqiao Town, destroying one civilian boat and over thirty civilian houses, killing and injuring over thirty residents. The enemy planes were still not satisfied and continued to fly low, strafing with machine guns. The enemy army's repeated bombing of our non-combat zones and non-military personnel is truly despised by the world.

Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai: At 10:00 AM yesterday, three enemy planes circled over the town for a week and then dropped seven heavy bombs. Two of them narrowly missed falling into the Puhuitang River. The remaining five bombs landed as follows: one near the southern levee of Xiwantang River, one on the eastern beach south of the bridge, and one in the western beach north of the bridge. All exploded with great force. Seven or eight corpses lay on the ground on both banks. Five or six boats in the river were sunk. In a small boat north of Xiwantang, five people were killed. On the southern beach, four or five piglets were killed or injured. From west to east, north of the river, shops and houses were completely destroyed. Approximately ten houses south of the bridge were destroyed. Many merchants and residents in the town were injured. When the reporter went to investigate, the streets were littered with broken electrical wires. Wounded and dead people lay beside the road, covered in blood. Vegetable baskets and carrying poles were abandoned everywhere. Subsequently, the Shanghai Municipal Defense Branch sent a rescue team to the scene, transporting dozens of the more seriously injured to hospitals for treatment. Those with minor injuries were bandaged. The corpses of those killed were buried by the Tongren Fuyuantang and Pushan Villa with coffins. The town's police station and the entire staff of the defense corps clearly searched for the dead and injured and carried out emergency rescue operations, as well as the sorting of power lines and other work, which was extremely busy.

Zhabei

In Zhabei, starting at dawn yesterday, twelve enemy planes were divided into four teams, each with three planes. They circled and dropped bombs over Baoshan Road, Gonghexing Road, Sun Temple, Tanziwan, and other places for reconnaissance. A portion of them then continued along roads such as Dachang Highway and Hutai Road, bombing the area. Besides destroying several dozen civilian houses, there was no other damage.

At 9:30 AM yesterday, Zhirieli on Hengfeng Road in Zhabei was hit by three enemy bombs. The explosions started fires that burned down ninety-five houses. At 11:20 AM, three bombs fell next to the railway on Xinmin Road but did no damage. A total of forty to fifty bombs fell on Jinling Road, Datong Road, Gonghe Road, and other places.

From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday, enemy planes bombed the area north of the North Railway Station, Qiujiang Road, and the railway line. Around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, enemy planes again dropped bombs on Gonghe Xin Road, Qiujiang Road near Hutai Highway, Zhongshan Road, the railway line, and Beitangjiabang, west of Hujiang University. Also, at 11:30 AM yesterday, when enemy planes bombed the North Railway Station, three sections of the railway track, one about twenty-six inches long and the other two about sixteen inches each, were blown into the Huishi district, showing the ferocity of the enemy planes' bombing power.

Pudong

In Pudong, starting yesterday morning, six enemy planes were divided into two teams, circling and reconnoitering over Gaomiao, Yangjing, and Yangjiadu. They dropped over ten bombs in Yangjiadu. In the past three days, enemy planes have been bombing Pudong wildly. More than half of the Yangjing Town's three-li Yaoshi market has been destroyed. On the afternoon of the 17th, Tangqiao Town in Pudong was bombed four times again. Two-thirds of the market there has been destroyed. The total number of civilian casualties before and after is over one hundred people. In the entire Tangqiao area, the bodies that have been dug out include three people killed in the bombing of the Yanjiaqiao Tangyan Elementary School, and six houses near Zoujin Market. The residents Yan Xingen, Zhang Fuquan, Wang Yinshi, Hu Yanshi, seven people in total, plus four children, Chen Yishan's firewood shop west of the Lixue Nunnery in Liuliqiao, the girl Chen Xinbao died, as well as one passerby, eight people died and over ten were injured on the refugee boat moored at Tangmuqiao, three men from the Nanbufang of Wang Shengda's incense shop in the Nanlujiazhai of Dongmuqiao, a woman who had just given birth, a child, and an old woman died, the countrywoman Chen in Shanjiamen died, as well as two men, nine men and women died in the Xujianongtang. There are over fourty bodies, and others are still being searched for. There are over a hundred injured. From Xinma Road in Tangqiao, across the road to the east, all the way through Shanjiamen to near the base of the dam, the houses were completely destroyed. Three classrooms of the elementary school across from the dam base were destroyed. In total, civilian housing losses include approximately one hundred houses destroyed on Tangqiao Road, and over fifty houses burned and destroyed in the Nanlujiazhai area of Hamnan. In the Yangjing area, including Yangjiadu, Yujiamiao, Qichangzhan, and Chenjiazhai, over twenty houses were bombed at the same time as Tangqiao the day before, with eighteen killed and injured. However, starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, three enemy planes dropped over ten bombs in the area north of Zhangjiabang and Yangjiadu. In Caonitang and other places, many poor people's houses were destroyed, and over ten people died or were injured. Starting at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, several enemy planes bombed Pudong Shanyangjing four or five times, dropping over thirty bombs in the area from the 18th Jian, Qichangji, Chunjiang Pier, Lannidu, and Yangjiadu. They were still bombing at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.

Zhenru

At 9:40 AM yesterday, six enemy planes dropped eighteen bombs near the Nanguixing Xiang in the Zhenru area, destroying four or five civilian houses, injuring over ten people, and killing over twenty people. The injured were immediately rescued by the twelfth member of the tenth emergency rescue team of the Chinese Red Cross, team leader Zheng Yunkun, Tao Yayu, and team leader He Linxiang, at the risk of the aircraft bombing and sent to the fifth branch of the World Red Cross for treatment.

### Coming and Going Amidst Bombing

— Guo Moruo

㊉

I had just returned to my residence from Yue Jun's place when Chunru called, saying that Mr. Jiang wanted to talk to me, and I should go immediately. A car would be sent to pick me up. Before long, the car indeed arrived.

It was raining, and sitting alone in such a grand car, I felt a little excited. The driver didn't need directions; he simply drove.

After some twists and turns, we arrived at a place, and I was guided on foot for a while, arriving at a very simple residence.

As soon as I entered the hall, Mr. Jiang, wearing a dark gray Chinese robe, walked out from the left, with a smile on his face and unusually bright eyes.

"You've arrived. You look better than before." Mr. Jiang said amiably, shaking my hand, which was unusually warm.

The hall was quite spacious. Not far from the entrance, a long table was placed horizontally. Mr. Jiang sat on a large chair in the center, with his back to the door, and asked me to sit in the main seat opposite the table. I said that my hearing was not good, and I hoped to sit a little closer. So I sat on a sofa chair on the left side.

"You look better than before," Mr. Jiang said to me again. "You look even younger than before. How old are you?"

"I was born in the year of Ren Chen, so I am forty-six years old this year."

Mr. Jiang has always had an awe-inspiring presence, and some people unconsciously tremble in his presence, but he has always been exceptionally kind to me. This was the case during the Northern Expedition, and it is still the case today, ten years later, on our first meeting. This made me feel particularly comforted.

I also felt that Mr. Jiang looked better than before, with unusually bright eyes and an exceptionally rosy and radiant complexion, a radiance I had never seen even during the Northern Expedition. I had seen some pictures of Mr. Jiang after the Xi'an Incident, and he looked very haggard. The situation since the start of the War of Resistance has undoubtedly been extremely arduous, and thinking of Mr. Jiang's health, I secretly harbored some worries. But these worries were completely unfounded, as proven by my own eyes.

"Seeing is believing," and the words I had planned to say in my mind suddenly felt unnecessary. Because Mr. Jiang's eyes fully demonstrated his steel-like determination to resist the war, and Mr. Jiang's health fully guaranteed the steel-like endurance of the war. With the war of resistance both resolute and sustainable, could there be anything more beneficial for the nation and its people? Naturally, I am not a naive idealist who believes that the spiritual surpasses everything. But our current China must be motivated by the spirit as a prerequisite, because although the supply of materials is not sufficient, there have been some preparations. If the spirit of fearlessness is not mobilized at all, then all material preparations are just dead objects and will become a burden. Now, our highest spiritual power has been activated, and all material tools have been given fresh life. Life is a continuous and unbroken flow. Life begets life, and maintaining its continuous and perpetual flow is a physically inevitable trend. Therefore, once our spiritual power is activated, we must inevitably seek material enrichment to maintain the duration of our activities. Mr. Jiang is our supreme leader. Since he has the determination to resist the war for a long time, then he must have a long-term vision and a well-thought-out plan for the material conditions necessary for the war to be sustainable (such as the three major policies implied by Sun Yat-sen), otherwise, he would not have such clarity and tranquility.

He asked me about my research on oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions, and asked if I still had an interest in continuing to research them in the future. I said that as long as I had the materials and time, I would still like to continue researching them. I also mentioned that a lot of the materials on that kind of ancient artifact studies were scattered in various European and American countries, and I would like to collect them if I had the opportunity in the future. Mr. Jiang agreed to it, saying that he could find a way in the future.

He also asked if I had any friends who could do propaganda work. However, I answered this question very vaguely because most of my previous friends had dispersed, and some had changed their interests. Although I knew some people who were good at propaganda work since I returned to China, they were not necessarily my old friends. Although Mr. Jiang asked twice, I was unable to recommend anyone.

Mr. Jiang also said that he hoped I would stay in Nanjing and write more articles, and he would give me a suitable position.

I myself also felt that my work was most suitable for writing articles, but because I was deaf, I could not participate in any organization. Because it was obvious that I could not attend any meetings, I could not listen to other people's opinions, and my own opinions could not be connected. I frankly stated this situation, saying that I would definitely write articles, but I did not dare to accept the title.

Mr. Jiang said, "You don't have to attend any meetings. You can just write articles and study your knowledge."

Such sincerity really made me grateful. Moreover, in these simple words, he also gave me a way to work in the future: to take care of both sides. In my opinion, this approach is probably necessary in all aspects.

I didn't say much more.

Mr. Jiang also asked about my family and why I went to Japan.

Regarding the matter of going to Japan for ten years, I also answered very frankly. I said: I didn't have any money, I couldn't live in China, and I couldn't go to Europe or America, so I had no choice but to run to Japan.

In addition, he also asked about some of my personal matters. Finally, he said that we would talk in detail another day. So I said goodbye and got up. Mr. Jiang saw me all the way to the gate.

Another warm handshake, still a face full of joy, and unusually bright eyes.

### The World Unanimously Condemns Japan's Brutality: Over Ten Thousand People Attend Second Citizens' Assembly in London

Condemning Japan's Beastly Conduct and Advocating a Ban on Aid; New Boycott Group Established in Los Angeles, USA; Canada and Sweden Express Sympathy to China

[London] The London Party Department of the opposition Labor Party, the London Trades Council, and the London City Executive Committee held a meeting this afternoon in Trafalgar Square to oppose Japan's invasion of China. More than 10,000 people attended. Major Attlee, leader of the Labor Party's House of Commons caucus, and Green Wood, a member of the party's House of Commons, both delivered impassioned speeches, advocating the implementation of a boycott of Japanese goods and demanding that "the British government take action." A resolution was then passed, stating, "We are deeply disgusted by the Japanese army's 'slaughter of innocent Chinese civilians.' If other countries continue to tacitly approve of this kind of warfare, then the safety of the people of those countries and the future of human civilization will suffer a major crisis. "We hereby demand that the British government prohibit its people from selling arms to Japan or lending money to Japan." Major Attlee also said in his speech, "The Japanese government's economic position is extremely fragile. Japan relies on foreign trade as its economic lifeline. Among them, the trade between the British Empire, including the various autonomous territories and colonies, and the United States accounts for a large portion. The people of the United Kingdom and the United States only need to take individual action and exert economic pressure, and the Japanese government will feel a major impact. The London Consumer Cooperative has already initiated a boycott of Japanese goods. We only need to follow their example. The government can also imitate this." In addition, many participants held various anti-Japanese slogans, such as "Do not load or unload Japanese goods at London docks," "China's four thousand years of culture has been ravaged by Japanese barbarism," and "Japan's victory is China's demise." (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas)

[London] Attlee's speech also stated that the British people must closely monitor the "human animalization" that is currently rampant in the world. What the British people have witnessed is the unprovoked attack of a cruel imperialism on a great nation, with no excuse whatsoever. A mass meeting was also held in the Hull district of London, attended by more than 2,000 people. The Mayor of London attended and delivered a speech. Afterwards, a resolution was passed, sending a telegram to US President Roosevelt, endorsing his declaration that democratic politics is an active ideal. The meeting also advocated that all freedom-loving countries should unite more closely in the future. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)

[London] The Executive Committee of the British National Labor Movement previously passed a resolution condemning Japan's atrocities and advocating a boycott of Japanese goods. It also sent this resolution to the branches of the International Labor Federation and the Second International in various countries for endorsement. The Executive Committee of the British Trades Union Congress recently issued a statement, saying that the trade unions of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the Commonwealth of Australia, Mexico, India, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Ireland have responded to this call and have decided to implement a boycott of Japanese goods. The Austrian trade union also stated, "Although fascism is dominant in this country, Viennese women refuse to buy Japanese goods when shopping in stores." Sir Walter Citrine, Secretary-General of the British Trades Union Congress and Chairman of the International Trade Union Confederation, also told the press that the Chinese people are currently fighting against Japanese atrocities. The boycott of Japanese goods that we advocate is a preliminary and powerful action to express sympathy for the Chinese people. The Japanese government's censorship of news is very strict. The Japanese army's massacre of Chinese civilians has caused such disgust around the world that the Japanese people have no way of knowing it. Therefore, only by implementing a boycott of goods can Japanese merchants and people alike realize that foreign trade has stopped, and then rise up to pressure their government to end the cruel and unjust war against China. (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas)

⊙Los Angeles A new organization to boycott Japanese goods was established here today, called the "Promote Peace by Boycotting Japanese Goods Association". It is said that a banquet will be held on Wednesday evening to invite leaders from the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors to officially begin the boycott movement. Its declaration includes the words, "The Japanese militarists' ambition for war can only be curbed by boycotting Japanese goods and cutting off their financial resources. If we merely rely on diplomatic protests, we will see world peace completely collapse." (17th, National Telegram)

[San Francisco] Several hundred overseas Chinese here held a demonstration tonight in the thoroughfare to boycott Japanese goods. Traffic was temporarily halted. The demonstrators all held up banners and flags with slogans such as "Implement the Nine-Power Treaty." As a result, Japanese shops closed early. (17th, National Telegram)

⊙Ottawa The Canadian League of Nations Society announced today that it advocates that the League of Nations implement sanctions to punish Japan's invasion of China. The society's thirty-six branches are scheduled to hold a special meeting on the sixth of next month to discuss further action. (18th, National Telegram)

⊙Stockholm The Swedish national opinion is unanimously sympathetic to China in the wake of Japan's recent invasion of China. The Swedish National Professional Association, the Government Party Committee, the Swedish Women's Association, and the Swedish Youth Association jointly issued a declaration condemning Japan and formulating concrete measures to boycott Japanese goods along with the United Kingdom and the United States. The Swedish League of Nations Society has also petitioned the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to actively support China in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant in order to eliminate the scourge of war. (Central News Agency, 17th)

[London] Political circles here now believe that after British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Labor Party leader Attlee, and Labor Party MP Green Wood spoke, the British Labor Party's stance on sanctions against Japan during the House of Commons debate on the 21st of this month may take a more cautious approach than before. At present, various groups in the United Kingdom are expressing sympathy to China almost every day. Even the poorest people are now donating clothes to meet the needs of the disaster victims in the Chinese war zone. However, public opinion is clearly divided on the issue of boycotting Japanese goods. Bishop Manchester presided over a mass meeting at the Free Trade Hall today and said that he did not want to make any threats, but wanted to make a request. He did not believe that the true soul of the Japanese people fully supported the actions of their militarists in China. Stuart Hall, director of the China Department of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, who previously worked for the British firm Yuanfang in Shanghai, also said that attention should be paid to whether the suggestion of boycotting Japanese goods proposed by Manchester can be believed to be purely from a moral standpoint and has no other effect. Manchester's guiding newspaper reported that today's mass meeting eventually passed a resolution to impose economic pressure on Japan, but what kind of measures will be adopted in the future will be seen when the Nine-Power Conference is held.

### The US Side Explains the Purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Seeking Ways to Quickly Stop the Sino-Japanese War; The United Kingdom, France, and Other Countries Respond to Participate in the Meeting

[Washington] A State Department official said today that the main purpose of convening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is "to examine the situation in the Far East and seek ways to quickly stop the Sino-Japanese War." This was clearly stated in the Belgian letter inviting the United States to participate. The actions of the US delegation will certainly not go beyond the scope stated in this letter. The official also stated that the United States has not considered military sanctions and does not want to participate in international action on this matter. It is reported that the peace atmosphere in the Midwest of the United States is very strong, and newspapers there often criticize government policies. This statement by the State Department official is intended to appease this aspect. (17th, National Telegram)

⊙Beijing As of the present, five countries have accepted the invitation to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference: the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Canada, and China. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)

### British Ambassador to Japan Visits Japanese Vice Foreign Minister

Nine-Power Treaty Conference: Japan Has Not Yet Received Notification

[Tokyo] British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi for fifty minutes today. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

[Tokyo] A Foreign Ministry spokesman told a Reuters reporter today that the Japanese government is currently drafting a reply to the British government's protest to Foreign Minister Hirota regarding the incident on October 12 when Japanese planes machine-gunned the British Embassy's Air Attaché Murray. After receiving instructions from the government three days ago, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie sent a note to Hirota and exchanged views on the case. The spokesperson also said that the Japanese government expects the Belgian government to send a letter of invitation to the Japanese government to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, but it has not yet received this letter. The spokesperson also talked about the use of poison gas shells by the Chinese army, saying that he did not know that the Chinese army had used this shell, and that he had not heard that the Japanese army had been poisoned by this gas.

### Italy Sends Additional 2,000 Troops to Reinforce North Africa

Total Now Exceeds 30,000 Soldiers; France and Italy Disagree Again on the Spanish Volunteer Issue

⊙Naples: Fifty-nine officers, eighty-six warrant officers, and 1,885 soldiers of the Italian Army's 21st Corps recently boarded ships in this port bound for the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa. Over the past month, the total number of Italian troops sent to Libya has exceeded 30,000. The number of Italian troops stationed there has already surpassed the combined total of troops stationed in Egypt and French North Africa (Tunis). (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 17th)

[London] The Spanish volunteer issue is once again in danger of reaching a stalemate. France insists that if the government forces withdraw one volunteer, General Franco, the leader of the rebel forces, must disband four. France advocates for a "proportional withdrawal," while the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Grandi, suggests that both sides withdraw an equal number of troops. France argues that Italy should withdraw 5,000 troops, a reduction that would not cause significant losses to the rebels. However, if the government forces were to lose 5,000 troops, it would greatly affect special technical units such as aircraft and tank forces. Britain has also indicated that it can only consider withdrawing 500 troops as a gesture of good faith. France estimates that there are 100,000 volunteers on the Nationalist side, including 65,000 Italian troops, while the government forces only have 20,000 to 25,000. The Nationalist authorities claim that they only have 60,000 mercenaries, including Moorish troops, while the government forces' International Brigades alone number 15,000. At the same time, it is generally believed that Soviet Russia will not grant the right of combatants to the rebel forces, and even Britain and France are hesitant, fearing danger to the shipping of both countries. (National News, 18th)

[Rome] The semi-official Stefani News Agency recently published a report stating, "Approximately 40,000 Italian volunteers, including officers, are currently assisting the Nationalist forces in Spain. This number has been carefully verified, and the number of foreign volunteers on the Spanish government side far exceeds it." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 18th)

⊙Valencia: The proposal from Italy for both sides to withdraw the same number of volunteers in Spain is being ridiculed here. It is said that even if both sides withdraw the same amount, the rebel forces would still maintain a vastly superior combat force after the government forces' foreign volunteers have been completely withdrawn. The government forces have fewer than 15,000 volunteers, while the rebel forces have approximately 110,000. The International Brigades will not be established separately but will be distributed among the government's regular forces. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Martial Law to Be Imposed in Palestine

Grand Mufti Declares Anti-British Stance

⊙Jerusalem: British troops under the command of Major General Wavell, in retaliation for the Arab terrorists of Lida burning down British airport buildings the other day, also burned down the residences of these Arabs today. At the same time, sixty people were arrested for violating the nighttime curfew. Machine guns are densely deployed on the roads to maintain order, but terrorist activities continue unabated. If they do not cease, martial law will likely be implemented tomorrow. (National News, 18th)

⊙Jerusalem: According to local reports, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who fled to Syria from the Omar Mosque some time ago, issued a declaration today, calling on all Arabs to continue their efforts to resist oppression. Several representatives who distributed the declaration in Jerusalem were arrested, and the British authorities confiscated the Grand Mufti's funds, arousing the extreme anger of Arab figures. Telephone lines between Haifa and Jaffa have been cut off. Clashes occurred between police and Arabs in the port of Haifa, but the number of casualties is unknown. Clashes also occurred at the Qalandiya Airport near Jerusalem. (National Maritime News dispatch, 17th)

[Rome] Italian Muslims have recently held demonstrations in support of Muslims in Palestine. Religious leaders in Abyssinia recently issued a declaration opposing Britain's policy in Palestine, rejecting the plan to partition Palestine, and sending this declaration to the League of Nations, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, and the Grand Mufti.

Date: 1937.10.19

### Philippine Independence Issue

Quezon Delivers Speech

[Manila] Today, the Philippine Commonwealth Assembly convened. President Quezon delivered an opening address, stating that although the difficulty of achieving complete independence in 1939 may be postponed until 1946, it may not be overcome. Therefore, if we are determined to be independent, then we should not consider any consequences (regardless of any difficulties or benefits) and declare independence in 1939. If we deeply fear unforeseen disasters after complete independence and prefer to be protected by the United States, then it is better to completely entrust the matter of independence to our descendants. In short, we must not harbor unwarranted hopes that all dangers will be completely eliminated by 1946. Furthermore, the reason I advocate for independence in 1939 is that if we can ultimately accomplish this through President Roosevelt's efforts, we will be able to avoid many troubles and complications.

Essays

### Mr. Lu Xun's Scholarly Spirit

— Zheng Zhenduo

— Written for the Anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's Death —

Mr. Lu Xun was not only a passionate warrior but also a most level-headed scholar. He originally studied medicine, and his mind, tempered by modern science, is evident throughout his writings.

He was one of the greatest modern novelists; his essays and poems are all outstanding. However, people often forget that he was a scholar, a highly accomplished scholar who left behind many completed and unfinished works. His foundation in traditional learning was very deep, and the scope of his interests was broad. He studied under Mr. Wei Taiyan and was naturally influenced by him to some extent.

Everyone knows his "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction," but the scope of his research was very broad, not limited to the history of fiction. He was one of the modern collectors of rubbings from steles dating back to the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties periods, and until recently, in the past year or two, he was still asking friends in Beiping to search for them. He devoted several years to introducing literary criticism. He edited and printed "Selected Paintings by Lùgǔ Hóng'ér," "Käthe Kollwitz Woodcuts," and "Beiping Stationery Designs," "Journey of Woodcuts," etc. He compiled "Gleanings from Ancient Fiction" (36 volumes) and "Xie Cheng's History of the Later Han Dynasty" (5 volumes), and proofread "Ji Kang's Collected Works" and Liu Xun's "Records of Strange Things from Beyond the Mountains." In his last few years, he intended to write a history of Chinese literature and had collected a great deal of material. Sadly, "death" snatched away his pen, preventing us from seeing the appearance of this great work.

His scholarly spirit, like his spirit as a most courageous warrior, distinguished clearly between black and white. He hated evil as if it were his enemy, but he treated it with the most impartial attitude. He had the fairest judgment but never made ambiguous arguments. He based this judgment on the most profound research and the sharpest observations. He also never compromised on scholarship!

In the last of his essays, there is one piece, "Death," in which there are a few sentences that best express his spirit:

"I only remember that when I was feverish, I thought of the European custom of asking others for forgiveness and forgiving others when dying. My enemies can be said to be numerous. If a new type of person asks me about it, how should I answer? After thinking about it, I decided: let them hate me, and I will not forgive any of them."

In scholarship, he was also unforgiving. He dug up, studied, and observed, all with a calm, sharp mind. If he wanted to study something, he would grasp it firmly and never let go. We see that since the introduction of new art theories to China, he is still the only person who has introduced them most thoroughly and well from the ground up. He has many published books, and from proofreading to cover design, everything is done by his own hands. When he proofreads, he proofreads each word carefully, never perfunctorily, never carelessly letting anything pass, never relaxing in the slightest. Proofreading books is like facing an enemy; he can never forgive even the smallest error. This is his scholarly spirit.

We can cite one or two examples. His "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" has been a compass for those studying the history of fiction in the past decade or so. Although it is only a little over 340 pages, not a large volume, it is truly a work that has been hammered and refined thousands of times. From the third chapter, "Fiction Recorded in the Bibliographical Treatise of the History of the Han Dynasty," to the seventh chapter, "A New Account of Tales of the World and Its Vicinity," it was all gleaned from the meticulously stitched 36-volume "Gleanings from Ancient Fiction." The eighth chapter, "The Legendary Literature of the Tang Dynasty," to the eleventh chapter, "The Strange and Legendary Literature of the Song Dynasty," were written after studying 500 volumes of "Taiping Guangji" and "Qing Suo Gao Yi," "Gu's Wenfang Novels," and other ancient books. The attitude was most cautious and careful, and it cleared away the errors and shallowness of the novels of the Hundred Schools of the Tang Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty Series, and the Dragon Prestige Secrets, etc., since the Ming and Qing dynasties. The clearer understanding of the legendary literature of the Tang and Song dynasties in recent times is all due to Mr. Lu Xun's efforts. (He has another collection of legendary tales from the Tang and Song dynasties, on which he also worked very hard.) From the twelfth chapter, "Storytelling of the Song Dynasty," to the penultimate twenty-eighth chapter, "Novels of Condemnation of the Late Qing Dynasty," the materials are all fresh and new, and one does not know how much searching effort was spent. His "Notes on Old News in Fiction" can prove this: his lack of casualness in the authenticity and selection of materials is very different from the "Textual Research on Fiction" and other books by Jiang Ruizhao and others.

His most insightful and readily demonstrable judgments, such as the belief that Wu Cheng'en's "Journey to the West" had a basis, were later confirmed by the discovery of "Journey to the West" in the Yongle Encyclopedia. His judgment on Feng Menglong's edited "Three Words" remains unshaken even though more materials have been discovered today than he had seen. Because he did not make hasty conclusions, his conclusions were not easily changed once he made them.

When many people were advocating for the small essays of the late Ming Dynasty, he certainly could not stand it. They all regarded the small essays of Yuan Zhonglang, Wang Jizhong, and others as the highest works, praised them incessantly, and imitated them one after another. However, although Mr. Lu Xun rose up to rebuke this retrograde trend, he did not completely obliterate the position of Zhonglang and Jizhong in the literary world. He saw with the fairest eyes that Yuan, Wang, and others were not only writing small essays but also had big articles with a "square scarf atmosphere."

In his essay "Selections" (see "Collected Works Outside the Collection"), he had a few sentences that said: "Taking 'Selections of Refined Literature' as an example, without Ji Kang's 'Family Instructions,' readers would only feel that he was a misanthropic, seemingly inexplicably unhappy eccentric; without including Tao Yuanming's 'Idle Rhapsody,' they would drown out the fact that he was also a pedantic scholar who both borrowed the meaning of folk 'Midnight Songs' and rejected it with the Way of the Sages."

He was able to see the big picture and the whole picture in every aspect.

He was the most meticulous textual critic and collator. His work in collation was no less than that of Gu Qianli and Huang Yunpu, and what was more advanced than them was that he did not stop at textual criticism and collation.

He worked from the ground up. He laid a solid foundation, gathered all the materials, and then, after sharp observation and careful analysis, made a judgment with a fair attitude.

Not carelessly, not perfunctorily, working from the ground up: this is his scholarly spirit.

The success of a scholar is never a matter of luck; Mr. Lu Xun's success was the result of his painstaking efforts.

### World Games Cancellation Decision: US and France Express Agreement

Deciding to Take Joint Action with Britain; Refusing to Compete with Japanese Athletes; Chu Minyi Discusses Lessons from the Former Far Eastern Games

Since the Shanghai sports community organized the Sports Patriotic Salvation Association and responded to Britain's refusal to participate in the 1940 World Games, it was learned yesterday from an interview with Central Committee member Chu Minyi that the purpose of the Olympic Games organization is to maintain world peace and improve human morals through sports competitions. Currently, Japan is massacring innocent civilians in China, which has shown a loss of morality, and the countries should unanimously detest it and not compete with it. Moreover, when the former Far Eastern Games were held in the Philippines, the Japanese coerced the countries to recognize the participation of the puppet state of Manchukuo in the competition and illegally dissolved the Far Eastern Games organization. Using this as an analogy, Japan can still manipulate all puppet organizations to participate when the World Games are held in Japan in the future. What will our people think about this at that time? Therefore, it is hoped that the government authorities may wish to consider it. As for the sports community, it should take this opportunity to telegraph all countries, call for peace, and convene the Olympic Executive Committee to discuss how to cancel the membership of the Japanese Empire and plan to move the World Games that year to another country. Although this move is not related to the overall situation, it will shift international attention and be of some help. The United States, France, and other countries have expressed their agreement with the decision of the British National Sports Federation to ask all countries to stop participating in the 1940 World Games held in Japan and have decided to take joint action and refuse to participate. At the same time, they are also planning to move the World Games that year to another country.

### Silver and Money Industries Notify Firms to Economically Sever Ties with Japan

Strictly Handle the Suspension of Transactions in Japanese Remittances and Securities

The Shanghai Silver and Money Industries Association sent a letter to member firms, stating: "We have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Support Association, stating that within the ninth item of the resolutions of the first executive committee meeting of the National Economic Disconnection Committee of Shanghai, it is written that a letter should be sent to the trust industry, money industry, and banking industry to stop transactions in Japanese remittances, securities, and other financial relationships. The matter concerns emergency measures for economic disconnection. In addition to sending separate letters, this letter is sent to inform you that the association hopes that you will investigate, inform your members, strictly handle it, and respond accordingly." This letter is hereby conveyed for your reference.

### Securities Transactions to Be Settled on Schedule

The Association Has Successfully Negotiated; Conclusion in Short Term

Before the August 13th Resistance War, the Tong Gong Bonds and Fuxing Gong Bonds bought and sold on the Shanghai Stock Exchange by merchants and investors from various provinces were not settled due to the outbreak of war. The Ministry of Finance previously ordered the Stock Exchange Council to handle the settlement, but the Brokerage Association, considering that the total amount of investment had a balance of over 100 million yuan, needed to work together harmoniously and handle it carefully. Therefore, it repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance to carry out the settlement after a proper plan had been devised. Also, because there is currently no market, various parties are further discussing detailed plans to coordinate the handling. It is recently learned that the outstanding balances will be settled in a short period of time. The Brokerage Association is negotiating with various parties and is very satisfied.

### Two Groups Broadcast for Donations

Film Industry Pleads for Refugees; Ballad Singing Association Raises Relief Supplies

The Film Industry Patriotic Salvation Association has scheduled broadcasts in cooperation with the Relief Committee on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, for three days, to plead for the millions of refugees. The participants are all well-known male and female film actors, and short, well-made dramas will also be broadcast at the same time. The plays include (1) "August 13th," (2) "Lugou Bridge," and (3) "Ah Q," written by Mr. Chu Han; (1) "The Seventh September 18th," written by Mr. Cai Chusheng; (1) "The First Lesson," written by Mr. Sun Yu; "Everyone Go to Join the Army," written by Mr. Shen Xiling; and "Dawn," written by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian. Hu Die, Wang Renmei, Chen Yanyan, Gao Ge Fei, Chen Juanjuan, and others will play important roles. It is sure to be wonderful at the time. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate generously so that Shanghai refugees can receive sufficient assistance. This would be extremely fortunate.

All members of the Ballad Singing Research Association, considering that the soldiers fighting valiantly to defend the country at the front need a great deal of assistance from the public, such as cotton vests, first-aid kits, motorized bicycles, small steamships, and bicycles, have gathered famous artists at the Oriental Broadcasting Station to broadcast and solicit donations from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM every day.

### People Serving at the Front Receive Excellent Treatment

Fusing Military-Civilian Cooperation

The soldiers fighting the enemy at the Weidian Liuhang front were previously unfamiliar with the local routes, so they sent people to the Baoshan Shanghai Native Place Association to select local villagers to guide them for military purposes. The association then asked the Baoshan Second District Chief Lu Fengtao and the Fifth District Chief Shen Buyin to recruit six guides familiar with the village roads and send them to a certain unit. They have been working for a month and have been transferred to Shanghai for rest. According to the guides Su A'si and Zhu A'jin, they reported that they lived at the front and received excellent treatment. In addition to guiding, they also took on the responsibility of connecting with the people and integrating military-civilian cooperation. The soldiers' bravery in battle is especially inspiring to us. They plan to rest for a few days and then go to the front to serve again. Therefore, the county native place association plans to continue recruiting, training, and distributing them to the front to serve.

### Social Bureau Broadcasts Wartime Education

The Municipal Government Broadcasting Station's wartime education broadcast by the Social Bureau at 11:30 AM every day is very popular with listeners. The topics broadcast by the bureau this week are listed below. The station's weekly rate is 900 kilocycles. Citizens are asked to pay attention to the following: October 18, How Should We Educate Children During Wartime (Gu Yinqian); October 19, The Awakening That Women Should Have During Wartime (Jin Guangmei); October 10, How Should We Train Young People During Wartime (Xu Zexiang); October 10, The Awakening That College Students Should Have During Wartime (Zhou Shifu); October 10, How Should Civilians Do Support Work During Wartime (Nie Haifan); October 20, How Should Civilians Improve Their Daily Lives During Wartime (Sun Letao).

### Brokerage Association Collects Old, Broken, and Waste Fabrics

Waste Utilization to Manufacture Military Shoes

The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange Brokerage Association, which runs the Seventh Shelter of the World Red Swastika Society, houses more than 600 refugees. Currently, because the refugees have nothing to do all day long, they are very willing to make straw sandals and cloth shoes to send to the front lines to meet military needs. However, due to the lack of cloth, they have been unable to fulfill their wishes. If there are any old, broken, and waste fabrics, as well as scraps of cloth cut from making cotton vests, they can all be recycled for use as shoe materials. If you are willing to donate enthusiastically, please send them to 260 Avenue Edward VII, Cotton Cloth Exchange Brokerage Association, or the Seventh Shelter of the Red Swastika Society in Liu Family Alley, Rue Paul Beau, French Concession.

### Various Relief Organizations Agreed on Relief Methods in War Zones

The Refugee Relief Association Shanghai Branch, the Charitable Organizations United Relief Association, and others, considering that the victims in the war zones are extremely poor and urgently need relief to alleviate their suffering, yesterday held a joint meeting with the United International Relief Association, the China International Famine Relief Commission, the Catholic Action Association, the Red Swastika Society, the Jisheng Association, and other organizations. It was agreed that each organization would appoint one responsible representative to form a war zone relief delegation, establish an office in the Renji Benevolent Hall, and appoint Qu Wenliu as the director to preside over relief matters. It is reported that the relief methods will stipulate four types of relief amounts: poor, moderately poor, extremely poor, and special. Each organization will then take charge of relief funds in separate areas. In addition, the refugees from the Yinhang area who have been displaced to the Pudong war zone will have Lu Bohong as the responsible representative for relief.

### Lu Xun Anniversary

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) One year has passed since Mr. Lu Xun passed away. I remember in his essay "On the Second Death," he mentioned that after his death, he hoped "not to do anything to commemorate [him]," but as a "soldier" who was always a brave pioneer in the national liberation movement, can we easily forget and truly respect his last words by not doing anything to commemorate him? Indeed, as long as we work diligently and fight tirelessly, as he himself said, "I am an ox, I eat grass, but I squeeze out blood and milk," life, death, and commemoration are irrelevant. However, on this anniversary, we cannot help but do something to commemorate him. On this sorrowful memorial day, we can tell him some good news before his spirit: the sacred war of national liberation has already broken out and has already achieved considerable success.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Wartime Literary Association initiated a Lu Xun Anniversary Speech Meeting, held at the YWCA. Because the YWCA's auditorium was particularly small, listening tickets were issued in advance. However, when this reporter arrived at the venue, it was not yet the scheduled time for the meeting to begin. Outside the auditorium's main entrance, many young people were already crowded. Around the lawns and on the stone-paved avenues leading in, many more people continued to walk toward the auditorium. This crowd appeared smaller compared to last year when the body was placed in the coffin at the International Funeral Parlor. However, seeing the swarming scene in front of the auditorium's entrance surprised me greatly. It was not until this reporter squeezed up the steps that I understood: due to the collection of listening tickets, a small door was being blocked by the crowd.

After presenting my card, I managed to squeeze into the crowd. Those who had arrived earlier had already occupied half of the seats in the auditorium. If everyone outside the door were to come in, I truly worried about how to accommodate so many people commemorating Mr. Lu Xun.

The auditorium was decorated simply. Hanging on the stage was a portrait of Mr. Lu Xun. This mentor of youth still looked as vibrant as when he was alive. In front of the stage were wreaths sent by various groups, including the Shanghai Wartime Literary Association, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Student Salvation Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Women's Association for Comforting Soldiers, the Wartime Service Corps of the Customs Staff, and individuals such as Guo Moruo, He Xiangning, Liao Xianfei, Chen Sujuan, and Ba Jin. The four walls were covered with photos of Mr. Lu Xun, woodcuts, photos of the crowds during the funeral procession last year, and manuscripts in Mr. Lu Xun's own handwriting. On the left and right sides of the stage, two rows of tables were filled with Mr. Lu Xun's translations. Almost all the blood and milk he squeezed out were here.

As it approached 2 o'clock, the time for the meeting to begin, a sudden commotion arose outside the door. Many people without listening tickets were unanimously demanding to be let in, saying, "What reason is there to prevent me from attending the Lu Xun Memorial Meeting?" No one could answer this. After the hosts discussed it for a while, they completely removed the seats in the auditorium, allowing everyone to stand, which could of course increase the number of people by less than double. However, as soon as the auditorium doors were opened, there was not a single empty space in the auditorium within half a minute. Those who came later could only stand under the staircases in the hallway. At this time, this reporter squeezed onto the middle section of the staircase. From this position, I could see the situation on the stage. Therefore, relying on my hearing, I paid attention to the situation in the auditorium.

At this time, Ms. Xu Guangping came in with her child, Hai Ying. When they reached the hallway, there was no way to get in, and there were no receptionists outside. Presumably, someone from the YWCA managed to help them enter from a side door.

The memorial ceremony was very simple. The chairperson, Shan Daiping, presided over the event, and Yin Yang served as the master of ceremonies. First, the choir sang a Lu Xun Memorial Song. This song was newly composed, and the crowd could not sing along. When the "March of the Volunteers" was sung next, it reminded everyone of the passionate scene on the way to the International Cemetery last year. People who did not want to be slaves had continued Mr. Lu Xun's legacy, advancing on the front lines throughout China with walls of flesh and blood in the face of enemy fire. This iron-like force vowed to force the invaders to surrender. After paying the highest respects to Mr. Lu Xun, we observed a minute of silence to mourn the fallen soldiers who died on the front lines of the war of resistance. Our heroic soldiers are completing the greatest cause in the world on the front lines! Following this, the chairperson gave a speech, and speeches were given by Xu Guangping, Guo Moruo, Feng Xuefeng, Chen Wangdao, Tian Han, and Jin Ding, representing the Wartime Literary Association. (Speeches omitted) However, I would particularly like to mention a comment by Mr. Guo Moruo: If Mr. Lu Xun were still alive, he would certainly be very happy to see the current situation, but he would still frown, feeling that many things are too bad. (Because I was standing on the half-staircase by the hallway, I could not hear very clearly; this is just the gist.) Therefore, we do not necessarily have to respect Mr. Lu Xun's last words, "Do not do anything to commemorate [me]," but when we do commemorative things, we should learn from Mr. Lu Xun's spirit, "Work earnestly, fight tirelessly," not allowing ourselves a moment of retreat or negligence. Before the war of national liberation has achieved final victory, we must patiently advance step by step on the difficult road. I remember that last year, the National Student Salvation Association mourned Mr. Lu Xun with these words: "We have already learned from you the 'power of the collective.' We have already generally organized ourselves. We will fight the enemy together as a family. We are no longer afraid of the butcher's ferocity. We are no longer afraid of the tiger's brutality. We will take your 'fighting harder as we fight' spirit as our legacy."

This is what we mean by commemorating Lu Xun. At the same time, this oath must be practiced on every descendant of the Yellow Emperor. (Ping)

### Pharmaceutical Association Raises Funds for Relief

Already Collected Five Thousand Yuan

The Pharmaceutical Association held a meeting yesterday to raise funds for the Relief Committee. As a result, the following pharmacies contributed a total of five thousand yuan: Aihua, Jicheng, Nanyang, Zhongying, Huaying, Zhengde, Dahua, Zhongfa, Huamei, Huayang, Zhengwei, Kerdeng, Taihe, Wuzhou, Zhongxi, Dazhong, Taipingyang, Xinxing, Dalu, Jihuatang, Xinhua, Dazhong, Gongfa, Xinya, and Yongan Tang. Representatives will be sent to those who did not attend to solicit contributions.

### Zhongxi Pharmacy Donates 10,000 First Aid Kits

Great Need Exists, Urgently Awaiting Donations

Recently, various armies have been in urgent need of first aid kits. Zhou Bangjun, the general manager of Zhongxi Pharmacy, specially ordered the factory to rush production of 10,000 kits, worth two thousand yuan in national currency, and sent them to Yu Feipeng, Minister of Transportation of Nanjing, for distribution to various armies. Each kit is printed with the words "Donated by Zhongxi Pharmacy." It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee, entrusted by various armies, urgently hopes that patriotic compatriots in this city and other places will donate generously.

### Unemployed Workers' Relief Association Allocates Funds to Aid Textile Workers

Textile Workers' Wartime Service Corps to Go to the Front to Assist in Work

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Textile Factory Workers' Salvation Association, it has been handling the registration of textile workers in order to provide relief. Recently, it was reported that the Association had petitioned the Relief of Enemy Rear Support Association to provide relief. The Labor and Agriculture Group of the Support Association negotiated with the Shanghai Unemployed Workers' Relief Association. The Relief Association has agreed to provide assistance. Unemployed workers who are registered and willing to work in the interior will be given ten cents per day per person to temporarily maintain their livelihood. However, this does not apply to those who are not determined to work in the interior. Since the Association began handling registration, a large number of workers have come to register. It is now expanding to seek the participation of all unemployed or employed textile factory workers, focusing on fighting for the survival of the nation and the people. It is currently forming a Wartime Service Corps, preparing to go to the front to assist the military in its work.

### Liddell Has Not Yet Arrived in Shanghai

Admiral Liddell, Commander of the British Far East Fleet, completed his inspection of southern China and recently returned north on the flagship HMS Kent. He was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning. However, this reporter learned from the British Consulate yesterday that the Admiral had not yet arrived. This may be due to a slight delay caused by passing through Xiamen. The date of his arrival in Shanghai has not yet been notified by telegram.

### Wang Xiaolai Speaks: Industry and Commerce Should Save the Nation from Their Positions

Factories That Cannot Resume Operations Alone Should Jointly Start Operations and Establish Branches in the Interior

Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, made the following statement yesterday: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, in addition to handling rear area work and soliciting public bonds to save the country, the Chamber has paid the most attention to restoring business operations and facilitating the flow of goods. For the restoration of business operations, important industries such as finance, pawnshops, and rice shops have been encouraged by the Chamber to resume operations. The Chamber has also tried to facilitate the supply of daily necessities related to people's livelihoods, such as local goods, fresh pork, beef, mutton, and various fresh goods, by applying for flags and passports for various associations to smooth the sources of supply and avoid shortages. The Chamber has also made every effort to help production factories start operations. Although the results are not yet fully satisfactory, the daily necessities are not in short supply, and all industries are barely maintained, which can also help in the long-term war of resistance. Today, I received a telegram from Commander ×, stating that all merchants transporting ordinary commercial goods and equipment from Shanghai will be given convenience, which shows the Commander's utmost concern for commerce and maintaining the rear. As for raising public bonds to save the country, which is a vital plan for national salvation, it is extremely important, and all must do their best to enthusiastically subscribe. In addition, all production factories should also strive to find ways to quickly start operations and manufacturing, maintain the livelihood of laborers, and strengthen the power of the nation. Those who cannot resume operations alone should also unite with fellow factories and merge to start operations. At the same time, more branch factories should be established in the interior to enrich people's livelihoods. In short, the final victory of the long-term war of resistance lies in the efforts of everyone in their respective positions. Now that the military commander is earnestly concerned with protecting industry and commerce, our industrial and commercial sectors must work diligently and make every effort to do so. As for myself, I have always advocated making efforts in one's position and saving the country with conscience, emphasizing honesty, self-respect, and preserving personal integrity. Since the resistance against the enemy, in addition to fulfilling my duties, I have also participated in various national salvation efforts. I have been suffering from running around for meetings and toiling with personal trivial matters. However, due to the complexity of personnel matters, there may be areas where supervision is lacking. If people from all walks of life have any observations or information, I urgently hope that they will tell me everything without any concealment, so that I can correct my shortcomings.

An investigation found that the amount subscribed by various merchants has long been sufficient and slightly exceeded. As of October 5, the funds delivered successively have reached more than 467,300 yuan. This achievement is due to the overall planning of Tang Fen, the head of the General Affairs Section of the Bureau, and the efforts of Zhou Yanying and Wang Shiji, the presidents of the Salt Merchants' Association.

### Customs Strengthens Anti-Smuggling Efforts and Hopes for Tips from All Walks of Life

Talk by the Deputy Commissioner of Customs

Recently, it has been heard that a lot of Japanese goods are being smuggled. The customs authorities are now stepping up anti-smuggling efforts. According to Qiu Zhuoqi, the Deputy Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, since rumors of a large number of smuggled goods spread, the customs anti-smuggling team has been working actively. However, since August 13, few smuggled goods have been discovered, only a few scattered small items have been seized. The Silk Fabric Association recently reported that a large amount of rayon is being sold cheaply in the market and asked for attention to be paid to the investigation. However, the report was not detailed, so it was not possible to find any clues. In addition to making efforts to investigate, the customs anti-smuggling work also relies on tips from all walks of life. At present, there are many rumors about smuggled goods. It is hoped that all walks of life can assist in the work and provide detailed tips to the customs so that investigations can be carried out and smuggled goods can be eliminated.

### Bank of China Resumes Foreign Exchange Swap Transactions

Specifies the Amount of Requests, Limited to Commercial Needs

Since the start of the all-out war of resistance, the volume of foreign exchange business in China has decreased due to reduced purchases by all parties, and the number of transactions is not large. Almost all of them are in British and American currencies. The exchange rate has always hovered around one shilling, three pence, and seven-five, so it is very stable. According to the Xin Xin News Agency, in order to stabilize foreign exchange, the Ministry of Finance previously instructed the Bank of China to temporarily suspend foreign exchange swap transactions. After requests from Chinese and foreign banks, starting this month, the discount rate for one-month swaps is one and eight pence for the British pound and one quarter for the US dollar. It is stipulated that the amount of requests from each bank each month shall not exceed 5 million yuan, and it is limited to commercial needs. The weekly request shall not exceed 5,000 British pounds or 15,000 US dollars.

### The End of the October Accounting Period is Approaching, the Money Industry Collectively Discusses Internal Market

Meeting Scheduled for the 25th

Since the start of China's all-out war of resistance, the financial market has been fortunately stabilized through the efforts of the Ministry of Finance and the establishment of a discount and lending committee by the four banks of Zhongzhongjiaonong to regulate finance. Therefore, the market is as stable as ever. The end of the long-term lending period at the end of October for Shanghai's industry and commerce is approaching in the blink of an eye. At this extraordinary time, the silver and money industries will inevitably allow a grace period until the end of April for the loans of various commercial firms, factories, and companies that are due. The Money Industry Association has scheduled a meeting of members of money shops at 2 p.m. on the 25th of this month at its office on Sibo Road to collectively discuss the internal market and all preparations. After the market is discussed and determined, each money shop will calculate the settlement at the end of October accordingly.

### Charity Federation Plans to Establish a Shelter for Women and Children

Negotiating with the Bank of China to Borrow a House

The Relief Committee for War Zone Refugees of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, in view of the fact that the season has reached late autumn and the climate is suddenly cold, and that helpless women and children will have a difficult time getting through the winter, plans to establish a shelter for women and children to provide relief. However, due to the lack of housing, it has not been possible to organize it. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to the Real Estate Department of the Bank of China, discussing the borrowing of two buildings, Nos. 3 and 5, Wujia Shahuayuan, Dada Road, Avenue Haig, as the site of the shelter for women and children.

### Relief and Rescue News

Relief

Since the establishment of refugee shelters by the International Relief Committee, due to its excellent performance, it has been praised by both Chinese and foreigners. It is learned that a Western couple, Mr. and Mrs. Meade, and Mr. Guo Bolan, visited the various shelters of the International Relief Committee yesterday, accompanied by the general secretary of the committee, and expressed their great appreciation. It is now reported that Mr. and Mrs. Meade will gather American expatriates to establish a shelter modeled after the committee's facilities. Furthermore, the committee's first shelter on Masnan Road currently houses 2,454 people. There is a dire need for cotton clothing and quilts to protect the refugees from the cold. It is hoped that enthusiastic patriots and philanthropists from all walks of life will generously donate.

The Buddhist Pure Karma Society Women and Children's Shelter on Hart Road was established by the Renji Hall, commissioned by Dharma Master Fan Cheng and layman Guan Jiongzhi, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance on August 13th. It has successively sheltered a total of 1,681 women and children. In addition to providing food, clothing, accommodation, medical care, childbirth assistance, and burial services, it also emphasizes education and work. Currently, there are classes for children covering all six grades of elementary school, with over 160 students in three classrooms. There is also a literacy class for the public with 42 members, with classes held for five hours daily. In terms of work, there are currently four sewing machines and over 140 workers making cotton vests to be used exclusively by soldiers at the front.

Rescue

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, Songjiang, being close to Shanghai, has become an important rear area. All good deeds, such as sheltering and sending off refugees passing through, as well as rescuing the wounded and caring for the dead, have been diligently handled by the local Red Cross. Recognizing the merit of their efforts, and in view of the protracted war of resistance and the increasing number of casualties, there is a great need for rescue personnel. Therefore, the chairman of the association, Zhou Xuewen, is organizing a rescue training class with 120 places. Ms. Jiang Xuezhu, the principal of the provincial women's high school, who is rich in experience, has been specially appointed as the director and will begin operations immediately. The association, considering that the Songjiang Women's High School has moved to a safe area for the start of the school year, and the inconvenience for students remaining in Shanghai to travel, will also provide free transportation to the school. All travel expenses will be undertaken and raised by Mr. Zhou Xuewen.

The Relief Committee of Fellow Villagers from the Five Counties of Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jintan, Lishui, and Yangzhou in Shanghai has already closed its shelter. Now, the committee has added a rescue team to serve at the front. Yesterday, the team departed for the first time to rescue wounded soldiers. The committee was originally located at the New Star Pharmacy on Park Road, but due to insufficient space at the original site, it has now moved to 23 Avenue D'Orleans in the French Concession as its office to continue relief work.

The Red Swastika Society rescue team set off for the front line last night at 7:00 PM. At a time when the war was fierce, the team worked hard to rescue 49 wounded soldiers, who were then sent to various hospitals for treatment.

The Rescue Squad of the August 13th National Salvation Association and the Sixth Emergency Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross set off for the battlefield last night at 10:30 PM, risking their lives. They rescued a total of 77 lightly and seriously wounded soldiers in areas such as Zhennanxiang, who were sent to various hospitals for treatment.

During this period of full-scale war of resistance, the Tongyi Primary and Secondary School on Avenue Foch is still crowded with students seeking admission. Moreover, the Boy Scouts are working hard to serve during wartime, sparing no effort, such as comforting soldiers at the front, soliciting national salvation bonds, and donating cotton vests and medicines, achieving considerable success. Recently, they were further instructed by the Municipal Boy Scout Council to serve on the battlefield at the request of a certain army commander at the front line. They are scheduled to depart for the front on the morning of the 20th of this month (Wednesday). It is reported that more than 20 Boy Scouts from the school have volunteered to go to the front line and have obtained parental consent to serve as replacements. Before their departure, a send-off meeting will be held to encourage them. It is expected that there will be a enthusiastic atmosphere at the time.

At about 10:00 AM on the 18th, three enemy planes suddenly appeared, circling around Hongqiao Road and dropping more than a dozen heavy bombs. Several bombs exploded, with the area near the Sixth District being the most severely hit, killing more than 20 farmers. The scene of the carnage in the fields was unbearable to watch. The police station in charge of the area telegraphed the Seventh Rescue Team of the Red Cross, which was led by the rescue team leader, Lu Bohe, and the entire team drove to the scene. They rescued 15 injured villagers, who were all kept for treatment by the team.

### Reports on National Salvation Work

Merchants of national goods have recently formed the "Shanghai National Goods Industry National Salvation Propaganda Service Corps" to promote the integration of the military and the people, and will devote themselves to propaganda in the rear and comfort to the front. They also responded to the three major movements of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, hoping that the leaders of the national goods industry will provide guidance.

The Youth Education Society in this port, a powerful youth organization, is currently managed by Sun Yu, Yuan Dingchang, Huang Yansheng, and others. They hold a cadre meeting once a day to discuss issues related to national salvation work. All comrades must work at the front and rear, and make many contributions to the education of refugees. Other activities include publishing wall newspapers, organizing propaganda teams, and swearing economic severance with Japan. Regarding the economic severance with Japan, the society has established detailed measures, with every ten people forming a group to closely monitor each other. Young education comrades are welcome to participate widely, which has also achieved results. They are also enthusiastic about soliciting national salvation bonds from young comrades, having already raised several hundred yuan and sending out their subscription forms.

The wartime common sense teacher training class organized by the Education Circle National Salvation Association in this port has appointed Chen Jicheng as the director. Classes are scheduled to begin on the 25th (next Monday). The subjects are tentatively set as six subjects: military affairs, air defense, poison gas defense, rescue, hygiene, and politics. Classes will be held for two hours every day, from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Colleagues in the education circle are welcome to participate in the lectures, so that they can be assigned to teach wartime common sense in various schools in the future. The registration office is located at 487 Nanjing Road, opposite the Hongmiao Temple. The registration deadline is the 22nd.

The Anti-Japanese Propaganda Team has achieved good results since its organization. It is now actively expanding its internal strength, and has specially invited playwrights Zhu Banren and Zha Yuqiu to serve as cadre instructors for the team. As for the singing group, it is led by team member Yuan Houbo. It has now been decided that before the certification documents from the Cultural Circle National Salvation Association are issued, they will do their best to collect various books, newspapers, and cartoons related to the Anti-Japanese War, and practice operas, etc., preparing to depart for Hangzhou and Ningbo on the 22nd of this month.

### Education Magazine to Publish Special Issue on Wartime Education

The Education Magazine published by the Commercial Press in this port, in view of China's full-scale war of resistance and in order to adapt to the needs of the times, will publish a special issue on wartime education. In addition to sending letters to experts at home and abroad to solicit papers, it is also welcome to contribute educational works that cooperate with the Anti-Japanese War. The number of words is most appropriate at 3,500 or 5,500, and no more than 7,500 at most. Once published, cash will be paid. The deadline for submission is set at the end of this month.

Commentary

### How Can We Be Worthy of the Soldiers Who Died for Their Country?

— Yi

In the recent major battles on the Shanxi and Shanghai fronts, the enemy has made full use of the power of the latest modern weapons. The intensity of the artillery fire at the front line, according to foreign observers, is even greater than that of the European War, the Italian-Ethiopian War, and the Spanish War. Our soldiers at the front, braving such intense artillery fire, still charged into battle and won many great victories. This glorious battle record not only guarantees the eternal life of our nation, but also won the amazement of people all over the world.

However, these victories were ultimately bought by our armed compatriots with their blood. Since the beginning of the war, we have heard many moving stories of sacrificing for the country. The deaths of army division and brigade commanders such as Hao Mengling in the Battle of Dabai River simply opened a glorious record for soldiers in the history of the Republic of China. In this war, I don't know how many from generals to soldiers have fulfilled their supreme duty to defend the country. Their sacrifices are immortal.

What should our unarmed compatriots across the country do to feel worthy of the soldiers who died to save the nation from danger? I think it is not enough to simply express heartfelt gratitude. We should recognize that the essence of modern warfare is a total war. For the sake of the nation's survival, men, women, old and young should participate in the war. Now that the armed compatriots who are at the forefront are under enemy fire and often make heroic sacrifices, the public must actively assume the obligation of military service and be ready to be replenished to the front line at any time to continue the unfinished aspirations of those who died first. This is one point.

Although the government has long promulgated preferential treatment regulations for fallen soldiers, I think it is not enough for the families of fallen soldiers to receive sufficient comfort simply from the government's customary preferential treatment. In the hometowns of fallen soldiers, the public must also have a memorial organization at the same time. This organization can launch various public ceremonies (such as opening memorial services and erecting monuments) to commend the loyal souls who died for their country, and raise public funds to support the families of fallen soldiers. This is the second point.

The above two points are worth considering by our unarmed compatriots across the country.

### Our Elite Troops Launch Fierce Counterattacks and Recapture Gejiapai House and Zhai Last Night

Continuing to Advance and Search for Remnants of Enemy Troops * Our Army's Successful Attack in Jiangwan Kills Over a Hundred Enemy Soldiers * Shanghai Textile Mill Completely Destroyed by Our Bombardment

At dawn on the 17th, the enemy troops launched a full-scale attack on the line along the Fengcun Tang Bank to Chenjia Lane, attempting to threaten our Dachang and Nanxiang. The enemy at Hei Da Huang House and Ba Shi Bridge House, with the cover of aircraft and artillery, competed for our position at Wanjiapai House. All officers and soldiers of our Qin Regiment resisted bravely in the rain of bullets and artillery shells, fighting for 24 hours. However, due to the intense enemy artillery fire and at the cost of significant sacrifices, all 1,400 officers and soldiers of our regiment made heroic sacrifices with the position. The enemy also suffered more than 3,000 casualties, with corpses scattered everywhere and blood flowing into channels. Afterwards, our elite reinforcements arrived and, taking advantage of the enemy's unstable foothold, equipped with strong firearms, launched active counterattacks in two ways. One route flanked along the road, and recaptured Yu's House, about 1,000 meters north of Maqiao House, yesterday evening. The other route launched a fierce attack on the enemy in front of Gejiapai House, and engaged in another fierce bloody battle with the stubborn enemy. Our army charged forward regardless of their lives, and our ×× artillery also concentrated fire and continuously fired to block the enemy's retreat. After a fierce battle until 1:00 AM this morning, Gejiapai House was finally recaptured. Both sides suffered extremely heavy casualties. Now our army is continuing to advance and search for remnants of the enemy.

For days, the enemy has been fiercely attacking along the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal. The position gained and lost has been sacrificed again. According to those familiar with military affairs, the enemy's actions are actually a plan to feint to the east and attack to the west. The enemy in front of Guangfu is now waiting for reinforcements and is about to attack, so they first feint an attack on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal to shift our army's target, continuing their attempt to break through in the center. Our army has long been aware of their tricks. Guangfu is strong and its defenses are solid. If the enemy attacks, they will be met with a head-on blow. The enemy at Dingjia House to the west of Changbang is trying to cross our front, and enemies have also invaded the southeast of Shixianggong Temple, but they have been repelled by us. There have been no fierce battles in the Miaohang area from last night to this morning. At 2:00 AM this morning, enemy ships suddenly bombarded our Jiang'an position at Baimaokou again. Our army was waiting in full force, but the bombardment stopped immediately and there was no attempt to land.

The artillery fire was dense, stretching for more than 2,000 meters, starting last night and stopping only this morning. The enemy's move was to hinder our counterattack and relieve the worries of the main force attacking Chenjia Lane. Our army is aware of their tricks, so they are waiting in full force, looking for opportunities to attack and achieve a pincer effect.

The Central News Agency said that according to the enemy lieutenant Osami Saburo, who was captured by our army, the enemies who have been attacking our Guangfu fiercely in the areas north of Guangfu, Nanmei House, Beimei House, and Tang House in recent days are the 43rd and 44th Regiments of the 11th Division. The enemy in the Xinmu Bridge area near Guangfu is the 33rd Regiment of the 9th Division.

Although the enemy sent reinforcements, they did not dare to attack again. There have been no fierce battles in that area from last night to this morning.

Reliable information has it that our army captured × enemy soldiers on the Dachang front yesterday. Their ages were all over 45 years old.

At the same time, two other enemy planes flew low and circled in the Pujiang area. The pilots in the planes could also be seen clearly. Their intentions are not clear, and they have not flown away until about 11:00 AM.

### General Masaki is Exhausted and Impoverished

Telegram Urges Commander Ueda of the Kwantung Army to Come to Shanghai to Assist * Regards the Shanghai Battle as Extremely Difficult and Has No Confidence

According to a certain Chinese person working for a Japanese company, enemy General Masaki believes that the Shanghai battle is extremely difficult and has no confidence in victory. He secretly telegraphed Ueda, the military attaché of the Kwantung Garrison Army, inviting him to come to Shanghai to plan strategy together. It is reported that Ueda has agreed to come to Shanghai to assist within a few days. It is also learned that there are still 4,284 Japanese merchants in Shanghai, most of whom are senior merchants with assets. Because they are being monitored by the Japanese army and prevented from returning home, these people have to stay in Shanghai reluctantly.

### Investigation of Enemy Cavalry Equipment

A Total of More Than Three Thousand Assigned to Various Locations

According to an investigation by the military authorities, it is now learned that the enemy cavalry coming to Shanghai to participate in the battle totals more than 3,000, all stationed at various rear-guard positions: ⑴ More than 300 at the Yangshupu Qiujiang Bridge Racecourse; ⑵ More than 200 at the Qiujiang Pier; ⑶ More than 200 at the Municipal Council open space at the Guizhou Road intersection in Yangshupu; ⑷ More than 100 at Wusong Town; ⑸ Three to four hundred at Wenzaobang; ⑹ Around 300 at Wusong Old Fort Taiwan; ⑺ Four to five hundred at Luodian; ⑻ Around 200 at Binshan; ⑼ More than 200 at Liuhang; ⑽ More than 300 northeast of Miaohang.

### Enemy Transports Aerial Torpedoes

Most of Them are Over Ten Years Old, What is Their Effect?

According to military intelligence, the enemy's giant transport ship Malaya Maru arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, carrying 76 aerial torpedoes. These weapons have been stored for more than ten years. Because most of the timing dials are inaccurate, the effectiveness is greatly reduced. However, the enemy still uses them for long-range shooting, and the 3rd Mechanized Unit of the 3rd Division is responsible for their use.

### Enemy Planes Attack the Capital Three Times This Morning

Bombs Dropped Outside the Southeast Gate and Xiaguan * Our Air Force Flies to Danyang to Intercept

The first time was at 2:20 AM, when more than ten bombs were dropped outside the Southeast Gate, with the obvious target being the Guanghuamen airfield. One place caught fire, but was extinguished after ten minutes. Chinese warships in the river at Xiaguan illuminated the sky with searchlights. After the enemy planes dropped their bombs, they flew away hastily. The second time was at 4:00 AM, when heavy bombs were dropped, shaking the entire city. At 5:00 AM, the alarm sounded again, but it was later learned that it was the Chinese fighter plane that had taken off to intercept the first enemy attack returning to its base, so the alarm was immediately canceled.

### The Vatican and Japan Sign an Agreement

Archbishop Cai Ning Denounces as Nonsense

[Xi'an] Regarding the Vatican's denial of signing an agreement with Japan, Archbishop Cai Ning told a Central Agency reporter on the 18th that he had recently received a telegram from the Vatican's General Secretariat stating that the United Press report that the Vatican and Japan had reached an agreement was purely a rumor, absurd and nonsensical, and not worth a smile from knowledgeable people. He hoped that all circles in China would not be deceived. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Vatican has twice declared that the Chinese nation has the virtues of loving peace and respecting justice. In order to prove its sincerity in caring for China, the Vatican has allocated funds to Shanghai to save Chinese wounded soldiers and refugees, etc. Archbishop Cai Ning went to Sanyuan on the afternoon of the 18th to inspect the diocese and will return to Xi'an in a few days. (Central News Agency telegram, 18th)

### Mayor Yu Lodges Second Protest Regarding the Case of义兵 Shooting Chinese Laborers

Reckless Firing Deemed Improper, Responsibility for Intentional Injury Should Be Assumed

Regarding the case last month in which Italian troops stationed on the banks of the Suzhou Creek shot and wounded Chinese laborers, including Cai Zihong, who were crossing the river, Mayor Yu lodged a serious protest with Italian Consul General Naro Ni, as reported previously. The Italian side's response was evasive. It is reported that Mayor Yu has filed a second protest. The original text has been obtained and reads as follows: "To Your Excellency, the Consul General, your letter of the 6th of this month has been duly received. However, this Mayor still finds it difficult to accept the points asserted in your letter. I hereby reiterate the reasons as follows: Upon investigation, the planks used for crossing the river, often in the early morning, were loaded with workers who regularly crossed the river, easily recognizable by the guarding troops. Furthermore, the first raft of planks crossing the river was allowed to dock. Why then were the workers on the second raft denied access, leaving those crossing the river at a loss? This point was already mentioned in this Mayor's previous letter. Moreover, when your country's soldiers prevented their advance, it is unrealistic to expect Chinese laborers unfamiliar with your country's language to understand or obey orders issued in Italian by your country's patrol team. Yet, the soldiers did not use other methods to stop them and instead recklessly opened fire, which was an improper act and should incur responsibility for intentional injury. As for whether your country has a treaty basis for exercising authority within the so-called defense zone, I will not discuss it for now. The various restrictions implemented in that area have also not been clearly announced. Even if these laborers, who are merely working-class individuals, had a slight misunderstanding, it would be reasonable. Therefore, the statement in your letter that all residents of the area are clearly aware of the designated crossing points is a one-sided account. The reasons conveyed in your letter as to why your country's soldiers had to open fire are insufficiently justified. Therefore, this Mayor believes that the responsibility for this incident should be borne entirely by your country's soldiers. The two innocent Chinese should not be blamed. In accordance with the aforementioned, a reply is requested. Furthermore, I hope that you will investigate and handle the matters mentioned in this Mayor's letter of the 30th of last month and provide a response. Respectfully addressed to Italian Consul General Naro Ni stationed in Shanghai."

### United States Takes a Firm Stance at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Davis and Hull Hold Lengthy Discussions, Italy May Participate

[Washington] U.S. Special Envoy to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Davis, held a lengthy discussion with Secretary of State Hull yesterday. It is reported that he has arranged to meet with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park today to receive the President's final instructions in preparation for sailing east on Tuesday.

It is also reported that President Roosevelt, to demonstrate the importance he attaches to the conference, will send a special message to the conference. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)

[Paris] Italy has received an invitation from the Belgian government to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be held in Brussels on the 30th of this month and is expected to respond within a few days. According to informed sources, Italy may accept the invitation because it comes from Belgium rather than the League of Nations. Officials had previously expressed reluctance due to fears that the conference would be held in Geneva. So far, six countries, including Great Britain, the United States, France, China, Canada, and New Zealand, have accepted the invitation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)

[Tokyo] Although the Belgian Ambassador to Japan, Bassompierre, has informally contacted the Japanese government regarding the Nine-Power Conference, it is reported that a formal invitation has not yet been sent to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The Japanese government does not wish to decide whether to participate until it receives the invitation. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)

### Old Brand Traitors

Goods are valued for their old brand, ensuring genuine quality and trustworthiness for customers. Similarly, entertainment is also best when it is old brand. In the past, old brand comedy possessed the power to attract audiences. Now, the enemy also chooses well-known old brand traitors to serve as their lackeys. These people have no conscience. When the nation roars with anger and the national army sweeps through, these old brands will surely be smashed to pieces without a trace. A word to the rats: Do not rely on the melting iceberg.

### A Westerner Returning to Shanghai Discusses the State of War Preparations in Dalian

Able-bodied Men Conscripted, Leaving a World of Women and Children, Chinese Forced to Construct Trenches

A Westerner who recently returned to Shanghai via Dalian gave a detailed account of the state of war preparations in Dalian, which is recorded below: ㊀ According to the Westerner, he had been doing business in Shanghai. Due to certain matters, he left Shanghai on July 21st and arrived in Dalian on August 3rd. He stayed in Dalian for a month. After the outbreak of the Shanghai battle on August 13th, due to the blockade and strict inspections in the area, rumors abounded. The Japanese authorities' official reports on the Shanghai battle, apart from the Allied News Agency's daily publication of so-called victory news, provided almost no access to the truth. The degree of victory described in the news manufactured by the Allied News Agency was almost unbelievable. At times, it even claimed that the Japanese side suffered no losses whatsoever while the Chinese army was failing in every way, which was truly laughable. On August 25th, he received the first letter from his family in Shanghai, assuming that the Shanghai battle would be like the "January 28th Incident." Subsequently, all transportation in Dalian was disrupted as ships, trains, and automobiles were all requisitioned for military use. ㊁ By early September, the people of Dalian were becoming increasingly uneasy and generally panicked. At that time, cargo transportation from Qingdao had also ceased, leading to food shortages and soaring prices, especially for vegetables. Japanese officials then levied a "war tax" of 20%, causing residents, both Japanese and foreigners, to complain bitterly. ㊂ As the Shanghai battle raged on for a month, Dalian became a city of deathly silence. Every day, Japanese soldiers passed through, sometimes as many as 20,000 to 30,000. Due to the limited space, the population suddenly increased. As a result, the Japanese authorities forced each Japanese household to accommodate three soldiers. One batch left, another batch arrived. All open spaces were turned into training grounds. From morning to night, all that could be seen were Japanese soldiers constantly drilling. The sound of bugles marked a state of full war preparedness. Young Chinese men were forcibly conscripted and assigned to dig trenches, build bridges, repair roads, and construct various defensive works in Dalian Bay, Lushunkou, and other places. ㊃ From then on, Japanese officials in Dalian became increasingly panicked. Chinese people fled to Yantai and then returned to China. Foreigners also left. All the large and small stores were closed. Dalian became a world of women because all the men had been conscripted for war. As a result, the police officers on duty, the conductors and ticket collectors on the streetcars and buses were almost entirely twelve or thirteen-year-old children and women. Whether walking or riding, everywhere one saw Japanese women carrying "thousand-stitch amulets," indicating a state of war frenzy. The Westerner came to Shanghai via Harbin. He said that railway trains in Harbin often derailed due to the continuous movement of military trains. These Japanese soldiers were mostly dispatched and concentrated in northern Manchuria, showing the extent of the Japanese army's panic.

### Enemy Aircraft Bombard Zhenjiang Twice, Targeting Civilians, Women, and Children

Over One Hundred Refugees Killed or Injured on a Train at Xinfeng Station, Six Women and Children Killed or Injured Near Zhenjiang Station

Zhenjiang Correspondent: On the afternoon of the 13th, at around 1:00 PM, six enemy aircraft came from the east and west above the clouds. The citizens of Zhenjiang thought the enemy planes were passing through. But in an instant, the enemy planes turned back, gradually descending low over the provincial capital. Two planes formed one group, attacking one after another. When the first group flew north of the Jardine Matheson wharf in the river, they suddenly turned and swooped down directly over the city area. Their focus was clearly on the refugee camp on the riverbank. Fortunately, our gunboats stationed in the river fiercely attacked with anti-aircraft guns, preventing the enemy planes from succeeding and forcing them to retreat into the high sky. The other enemy planes swept across the roads with machine guns before fleeing east together. Passing through Xinfeng Station, they saw a train carrying refugees, designated as a fourth-class carriage, parked on the platform. At this time, over a thousand refugees saw the enemy planes coming low towards the station. They helped the elderly and supported the young, crying out in panic as they fled from the train carriages and hid in the fields. But before they could disperse, the enemy planes flew overhead and fired machine guns and dropped bombs indiscriminately, killing and injuring over a hundred refugees who had no ability to resist. The reporter investigated at the railway hospital that night and saw over a dozen seriously injured people, all covered in blood and wounds from bullets and bomb shrapnel, a horrifying sight. One seriously injured woman said, "We saw the faces of the pilots in the planes clearly, as close as if they were on the floor above us. How could they not recognize that we were a civilian train?" On the morning of the 14th, at around 9:00 AM, another alarm sounded. Five enemy planes flew from the southeast in the clear sky, as small as dragonflies. Before reaching Jinshan, they suddenly scattered and circled over the provincial capital, then suddenly dived straight down. Less than thirty feet from the ground, with a loud boom, the engine room of the west station was destroyed by bombs. At that time, there were many women and children in the thatched sheds near the station, who panicked and didn't know what to do. They fled towards the Jurong highway. But the enemy planes pursued this group of women and children, dropping several bombs in succession, sending blood and flesh flying. Most tragically, among the dead was a woman named Gu Xu, who held her daughter's hand and carried her son in her arms. Just as she was desperately trying to find a way to survive, her head was blown off by shrapnel. When the enemy planes flew away and the crowd rushed forward to help, the mother's hand was still tightly holding her daughter, and the young son in her arms was still calling out to his headless mother. According to the doctor, the dead woman's husband was a station worker. When he heard the news and returned in shock, he saw that his wife was dead and his children were injured. He cried to the heavens in grief. Xu was thirty-three years old, her daughter, named Ruyi, thirteen years old, had a broken leg and was being treated. She was not in great danger. The son, named Hongxi, was only three years old, his right leg was blown to pieces and had been amputated. He had lost too much blood and was feared beyond recovery. Everyone who saw it was filled with sorrow. The cruelty of the enemy planes was truly hateful.

### Enemy Warship and Enemy Aircraft Sink Off Xiamen Port

Enemy Aircraft Crashed into the Sea After Being Damaged in an Attack on Guangzhou, Enemy Warship Sunk After Being Hit in an Attack on Xiamen

Xiamen Correspondent: At 6:20 AM on September 28th, a foreign ship here received a wireless message from the Taikoo Company's Suzhou轮, stating that while sailing from Hong Kong to Shanghai, the ship passed through the Dongding waters off Xiamen Port at dawn on the 28th and discovered a heavy bomber drifting among the waves and rocks, with people floating in the water calling for help. A sampan was launched to investigate and found that the aircraft body had been destroyed. Four people were rescued from the nearby water. They claimed to be Japanese air force pilots, part of a crew of six. On the 27th, they flew a heavy bomber to bomb Guangzhou. In the evening, the aircraft body was damaged by the Chinese air force. They turned north with the injured aircraft, intending to return to their base in Taiwan. Midway, the wind was strong, and the aircraft body could not withstand it. It crashed into the sea off Dongding Island in Xiamen Port. The aircraft body struck a reef and was completely destroyed. Two pilots drowned with the aircraft. They put on life jackets and clung to the tail of the aircraft, enduring the wind and waves in the water all night. At dawn, they were rescued by the Suzhou轮, hungry and cold, and severely injured. The Suzhou轮 transported the four people to Shanghai. The wreckage of the aircraft, after the four people were rescued, was driven away from the reef by the waves and completely submerged. It is said that the heavy bomber was worth 500,000 Japanese yen. Furthermore, on September 3rd, during the enemy warship's first attack on Xiamen, it was repelled by the Xiamen fortress artillery. At that time, Chinese and foreign observers on the mountains and fishermen in the harbor witnessed a large warship (i.e., a cruiser) being hit in the stern by our Yuzawei Battery, catching fire and exploding, and being severely damaged. Two smaller destroyers to its left and right supported the damaged warship as it left. At the time, it was only known that it was severely damaged. According to a fisherman named E Duo, who returned to Xiamen via the outer sea at the end of September, he witnessed the sinking of the large warship. He described the situation as follows: "On the morning of September 3rd, I happened to be sailing my boat outside the harbor. I witnessed three enemy warships attempting to enter Xiamen Port. Amidst the loud cannon fire, a huge enemy warship was hit in the stern by a cannon from the direction of Yuzawei. The warship rolled and shook violently, and the stern caught fire, with thick smoke billowing up. The enemy soldiers on the ship were in obvious disorder. Two smaller warships rushed towards the large warship, supporting it from the left and right, as if helping the injured, and sailed out to sea at full speed. I also raised my sails and followed it to the vicinity of Putuo Island, where I stopped. At that time, the stern of the huge warship had gradually sunk, and the bow was raised high. The two smaller warships were on the left and right, connected to it with iron cables, so that the huge warship would not sink immediately. At the same time, the warships, bullets and important items were removed to the small ships in a hurried manner. After two hours, the giant ship sank further, with the second half almost submerged in water, and the bow was raised even higher into the air. The two small ships were unable to bear the weight. Finally, the sailors on the two ships cut the iron cables together, and the giant ship slowly sank from the stern. Amidst the thick smoke and high sea waves, the giant ship sank to the bottom of the water and was no longer visible. Afterwards, I wanted to return to Xiamen, but was repeatedly threatened by the enemy warships to fire. Forced to do so, I sailed to the coast of Nanao, Zhao'an, Dongshan, Zhangpu, and other places, avoiding the enemy warships every day. After more than two weeks, I finally returned to Xiamen, and when I saw no enemy warships in the harbor, I quickly raised my sails and entered." E Duo is a fisherman with no naval military knowledge. His description of the enemy warship's damage, rescue, and sinking is extremely accurate. It is said that the enemy warship was worth nearly ten million yuan.

### Anti-Enemy Association Actively Promotes Training Programs

Wartime Remedial School Officially Opens, Enrollment Continues for Nursing Training

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association's organizing committee has been actively carrying out various tasks, including the registration and guidance of organizations and public training. Particular emphasis is placed on training programs. For example, regarding general public training, five wartime short-term remedial schools have been established and are scheduled to open today. However, the number of applicants has exceeded the original quota several times over, making it difficult to accommodate everyone. Expansion will continue in the future. The women's nursing training class has also officially opened, but there are still twenty vacancies. Enrollment is still open. Women with a secondary school education who are willing to participate in wartime nursing work can immediately register at the Tongde Medical College on Tongfu Road. In addition, wireless communication training classes, engineering training classes, women's sewing classes, and wartime civil mobilization training classes are also planned to be held in the shortest possible time.

### Traitor Chang Yuqing Establishes a Maintenance Association in Baoshan

It is reported that after the enemy troops occupied Baoshan County, they sent Wu Lansheng from Kunshan and others to organize a local maintenance association and invited Wang Zicai, a section chief of the county government, to participate. The enemy troops recently planned to expand the organization and use the association to undertake rear work, so they increased funding to 10,000 yuan. It is also heard that the traitor Chang Yuqing has been appointed as the president of the association.

### Our Air Force Captain Liu, Who Shook the Far East

Youth in Wartime, Issue 15

### Wartime Education Issues

—Yuansheng

Last year, I had a female friend, who, after visiting a Japanese elementary school, gave me a report. She said: "In the Japanese elementary schools, you can see many alarming pictures and slogans everywhere. This kind of environmental arrangement can indeed stimulate children's patriotic thoughts." She also said, "When a Japanese teacher is teaching children, she often turns the topic to patriotism. They instill patriotic ideas in children, and it has a special and great power, for example, today in the 'Raw Pear' lesson, the teacher asks the children many interesting questions before starting the lesson:

"Have you ever eaten the Tianjin raw pears produced in China?"

"Is the taste of Tianjin raw pears good?"

"How should you study hard in order to eat delicious Tianjin raw pears?"

In this way, the phrase "study hard" is deeply engraved in the minds of every child, and it contains many meanings, assuming we can think about it carefully."

At this time, I remembered what my friend said and couldn't help but think of a serious problem—the issue of wartime education.

"Education" is the treasure of the country, that is, a great force that the country contains that cannot be seen or grasped. In times of war, we need to work hard to excavate and inspire this treasure and this power, because it is not only related to the rise and fall of the nation, but also involves the safety of the entire country.

Modern Japanese youth, regardless of their class, all maintain a spirit of loyalty to the emperor and patriotism, which we cannot but say is the only power of education.

Ba Jin praised the innocence of Japanese children in "Call to Arms" and sighed at the power of Japanese education. I still remember the gist of what he said: "When I saw two or three Japanese children stacking yellow sand in Hongkou Park, I thought they were innocent, but when I saw that what they were stacking was an armored vehicle with a sun flag on top, I would feel the harm of this kind of anesthetizing education."

A Japanese elementary school student will bow more than sixty degrees to a teacher; a Japanese woman admires soldiers and crawls under their guns. These all definitely prove the greatness of the magic of education.

In the past week, universities, middle schools, and elementary schools in Shanghai have resumed classes one after another. I hope that the education authorities will carefully discuss the wartime education curriculum; I also hope that the teachers of each school will, while teaching students real knowledge, also pay attention to instilling patriotism, this serious issue.
