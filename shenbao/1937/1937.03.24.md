According to Director He, this trip to Nanjing is to report to the Chairman and request instructions on general affairs of the headquarters. As for Secretary-General Deng and Director Lu of the Sichuan Provincial Government, they are here to study further measures for sincere unity between the central government and the local government from an overall and fundamental perspective. In other words, to promote the nationalization of the army and the unification of politics, and to make the entire national military and political apparatus close-knit and responsive. I have been serving in Sichuan, upholding the spirit of Chairman Chiang's magnanimity and sincerity, and generally adhering to the principles of guiding with virtue and regulating with propriety. Therefore, in the past three years, we have been able to get along with each other and gradually make progress, which I believe is commonly recognized by the people of the country. Although there have been some rumors recently, they are actually exaggerations. Chairman Liu has taken supporting the central government and obeying Chairman Chiang as his duty. Even if there are slight differences of opinion between the central government and the local government, after this study, I believe that he will surely show results to the people of the country in the shortest possible time.

The meeting adjourned at 9:20 AM. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] When the Central Government held a memorial service for Deng Zhongyuan's martyrdom, Ju Zheng reported, the gist of his speech was as follows: "Mr. Deng Zhongyuan is a comrade with a long history. His martyrdom was not at the hands of the enemy, but at the hands of those who betrayed the Party and the country. This is not only Deng's misfortune, but also the misfortune of our Party. In the eleventh year of the Republic, the Premier was directing the Northern Expedition in Guilin and ordered Mr. Deng to stay in Guangdong to plan for supplies and weapons. However, Chen Jiongming harbored ulterior motives and wanted to harm him, resulting in the attack at the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station on March 22nd. At that time, the injuries were not fatal, but after being injured, he still mustered the courage to catch the murderer, resulting in excessive blood loss and death. The Premier heard the news and returned to Guangzhou, but the revolution was greatly affected. When we look back on the past, we can see that a comrade's setback is the Party's setback. Today, to commemorate Mr. Deng, we must recognize that it is easy to sacrifice a comrade, but it is very difficult to cultivate a comrade. If sacrificing a comrade has a great impact on the Party, this sacrifice is even greater. To commemorate Deng Gusheng, we must cherish the historical comrades of our Party so that everyone unites as one and cooperates wholeheartedly. Only in this way can the Party be solid, the country be unified, and the nation be revitalized." (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Further Discussion on the Issue of Early Independence for the Philippines

— Xing

In November 1935, the semi-independent government of the Philippines was established, with the intention of formally declaring independence on July 4, 1946. Within ten years, although the Philippines has an autonomous government, major powers such as diplomacy and military affairs, as well as judicial and legislative work, are restricted by the Washington government. Financial and economic aspects are even more restricted. In the past year, Filipino politicians have deeply felt that the road to independence is full of difficulties and the environment is harsh. Therefore, last month, Philippine President Quezon led a delegation to the United States to request President Roosevelt to improve the various relations between the United States and the Philippines. Recently, newspapers have reported that the Philippine President has proposed to realize the independence of the Philippines in the next year or in 1938. What are the reasons for this request from the Filipinos, and what will be the consequences? This is an issue that our countrymen should be concerned about. Let's discuss it further.

The difficult problems that the Philippines is currently facing are economic, social, national defense, and diplomatic, with the economic problem being particularly serious. When the United States first occupied the Philippines, it regarded the Philippines as a source of raw materials and a market for manufactured goods. Sugar, coconut oil, hemp, and tobacco are all needed by the United States. Therefore, Philippine industries are concentrated on these items. At that time, there were no tariff barriers between the United States and the Philippines, while the United States built strict tariff barriers against foreign countries. Therefore, the prices of sugar and oil were high in the United States, and the national economy of the Philippines depended on the United States. The income from sugar and oil was used to purchase American cotton cloth and other goods. Later, domestic sugar and oil capitalists in the United States were tired of the Philippines competing for the American sugar and oil market. Therefore, they mobilized congressmen to advocate for Philippine independence, so that American tariff barriers could be applied to Philippine goods. During the semi-independent period, there was a limit of 850,000 tons of duty-free Philippine sugar imports and 200,000 tons of duty-free coconut oil imports. Additional amounts are gradually taxed, increasing gradually until 1940, when the full statutory tax of the United States will be levied. In other words, the Philippines will gradually lose the market on which its national economy depends and fall into a state of isolation and helplessness.

During the semi-independent period, goods from the United States entering the Philippines are generally tax-free. Therefore, the Philippine market is still occupied by the United States. The current diplomacy of the Philippines is directly supervised and directed by the US government, and all tariff legislation and foreign trade treaties must be approved by the President of the United States. Therefore, the Philippines has no way to conclude favorable tariff treaties with other countries. The Philippines also has no freedom to exchange its domestic market with other countries' markets. Moreover, the international prices of sugar and oil have plummeted. Only the United States has particularly high prices due to tariffs. Philippine sugar, which has very expensive costs, cannot compete with sugar from Java and Cuba in the international market. Sixty percent of the Philippine financial revenue relies on the sugar industry. Ninety-nine percent of Philippine sugar depends on the American market for survival. If there is no way out for sugar, then there is no way out for the national economy of the Philippines. If the United States does not agree to find a solution, then the sugar industry will fail, farmers and workers will lose their jobs, and the Philippines will inevitably fall into the internal turmoil of Cuba. Moreover, the Philippine government has no financial power to borrow money, and everything is restricted by the United States. Under this semi-independent situation, there are more obligations than rights. In terms of freedom, it is insufficient to cope with the environment. In terms of strength, it is insufficient to build independence. This is why Philippine politicians are demanding early independence, and why the US authorities are willing to consider it.

However, the Philippine problem can never be solved by early independence, and the difficulties of the Philippines are by no means limited to the economy. The Philippine economy is not qualified for independent self-existence. Although its land has resources, it is definitely not enough to maintain a fully independent country. Moreover, the construction of basic industry and agriculture is beyond the current resources and manpower of the Philippines. The Philippines is located in the most dangerous environment in the Far East. Japan has coveted this island for more than a day. Economic aggression is even more alarming. Currently, Japanese cotton cloth has gradually replaced American cotton cloth as the clothing of Filipinos. The colonial development of Japan in the Davao region of the southern Philippines has made this region a Japanese prefecture. If this continues, the Philippines will inevitably become a possession of Japan. Therefore, at present, some Filipinos, seeing a bleak future and no good prospects, are learning Japanese and customs in preparation for joining Japan. The trend can be easily imagined.

Currently, the United States is still responsible for the national defense of the Philippines. President Quezon is sparing no expense and is working with American military experts to complete the Philippine defense plan. The United States regards the Philippines as its most important base in the Far East, so it has never taken it lightly. Even after independence, the United States will not abandon its naval base. Therefore, once something happens in the Far East, the Philippines is attacked, the United States cannot help but be drawn into the vortex of war. Will the United States abandon the Far East? Then it should not only grant the Philippines independence immediately, but also fundamentally change its national policy. Even if Japan annexes the Philippines, it may only turn a blind eye. If the United States does not withdraw from the Far East, then it should provide assistance to the Philippine economy and actively prepare without making selfish plans or retreating. You cannot have both fish and bear's paw. May the US and Philippine authorities think carefully about the crossroads.

### Japanese House of Representatives Discusses North China Smuggling Issue

Ichinomiya Advocates Assisting China in Anti-Smuggling Efforts; Foreign Minister Desires to Discuss It Together with Tariff Issues

[Nanjing] Today, the House of Representatives Budget Committee convened at 10:38 AM. First, Mr. Masataka Ota of the Seiyukai party questioned the educational policy for Japanese residents in Manchuria.

Foreign Minister Sato replied that education is based on the principles of the Imperial Rescript on Education, while considering the special circumstances of Manchuria.

Ota asked about the Sino-Japanese Trade Association held in Shanghai, stating his view that its effectiveness is expected to be minimal. Does the government have significant expectations for it?

The Foreign Minister answered that it is necessary for leading industrialists from both countries to seek friendship personally. He believes it is significant in deepening the understanding of the national conditions of both countries. The delegation should be able to inquire about the actual situation in detail and return. As for the current cabinet's policy toward China, it aims to promote economic and cultural cooperation before political negotiations, which the Chinese side understands very well.

Ota asked whether the Foreign Minister's so-called basic diplomatic work requires separate consideration for North China and South China.

The Foreign Minister replied that North China, Central China, and South China must, of course, be considered separately. His so-called basic work, he said, might seem to be replaced by Shidehara diplomacy, but he is considering it based on the current situation, neither actively nor passively, and it is not appropriate to generalize.

Ota asked if Japan has any way to respond to China's five-year plan to progress from an agricultural country to an industrial one. He also believes that China's currency reform has achieved considerable success. Even considering military preparations, domestic economy, and tolerance of communism, China's currency can still be considered to show a relatively solid pace. Regarding this, do Japanese financial institutions and banks intend to dispose of silver reserves?

The Foreign Minister replied that Japan should provide as much assistance as possible to China's five-year economic construction plan. As for the issue of disposing of silver reserves, it should be the same as stated by the Minister of Finance and should be left to the discretion of each bank.

Ota asked, for the sake of Sino-Japanese cooperation, he believes it is necessary to address the tariff issue. What is your view?

The Foreign Minister replied that in order to export products, machinery, and other goods to China, the revision of the Export Guarantee Law should be considered. Due to the development of transportation, there is also a great need for materials, which should also be considered. Therefore, efforts should be made to revise tariffs.

Ota asked regarding economic diplomacy in North China, he believes that full activity is still needed. Therefore, the relationship between investment and exchange control laws must be smoothed as much as possible. What do you think? Also, please explain the special trade situation in North China and other aspects.

The Foreign Minister replied that Japan's investment in North China should be welcomed by China. However, it is appropriate to invest in which industry? This matter should be studied in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance. As for special trade, although Japan is not directly involved, it is related to Japan's trade with China. Therefore, it is currently being carefully considered.

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee continued its meeting at 1:30 PM. Mr. Fusajiro Ichinomiya (Democratic) asked, regarding the crackdown on special trade in North China, Japan's assistance to China is not only a prerequisite for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, but also a bright attitude for the world. What do you think?

The Foreign Minister replied that he agrees with Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. However, economic cooperation should be considered comprehensively with political cooperation. The special trade in North China is a matter for the East Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Council itself, and Japan should not discuss it. However, Japan must consider China's tariff issues together, so careful study is necessary.

Ichinomiya asked if credit facilities for China could be established.

The Foreign Minister replied that the improvement of Sino-Japanese economic relations should be based on the establishment of credit facilities as a prerequisite. He is discussing this specific issue with relevant cabinet ministers. Recess at 7:05 PM (Domei News Agency, 23rd)

### French Woman Fanty's Bizarre Confession

Claims to be Mussolini's Mistress

[Paris] Fanty, the French woman who shot former French Ambassador to Italy Chambrun, claimed during her preliminary hearing in court today that she was the mistress of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini from April to July last year. At that time, Mussolini would meet with her regularly, but in July, he suddenly refused to see her. She reported this to Chambrun, who said that Mussolini might be unwilling to attend to other matters because his young son was ill. However, Italian officials later gave her a round-trip plane ticket, saying that she should go to Paris temporarily. She agreed to their request, but when she returned to Rome, she repeatedly sought to see Mussolini but was unable to meet him. She once attempted suicide with sleeping pills but failed. At the same time, the police also found documents proving that Fanty was a French spy. The court has now ordered doctors to investigate whether the woman has a nervous disorder. (National News Agency, 21st)

[Paris] The pre-trial judge Gerard continued to interrogate Mrs. Fanty today afternoon regarding her attempted murder of former Ambassador to Italy Chambrun. According to Mrs. Fanty's confession, she met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome in April last year and was scheduled to meet again in July, but she was not summoned by the Italian Prime Minister when the time came. She went to France and visited Ambassador Chambrun, who told her that Mussolini generally did not see guests. She then told Mr. Chambrun an important secret, and after the event, she repeatedly sought to see the Prime Minister and waited for many days before she was able to meet him. Later, Italian Propaganda Minister Alfieri persuaded her to return to France. When she returned to Rome in November last year, she learned that Chambrun had disclosed all the secrets and that all the unfavorable news about her was spread by Chambrun, so she hated him to the bone.

Most of what he said concerned the court's working conditions. Hughes said, "The work of the court is not delayed, and it has been the case for several years. Every time the court adjourns, it can clear all pending cases. The court's powers are originally stipulated by the constitution, part of which is to hear disputes between state governments, and part is to hear appeals from the people. The issue of increasing the number of judges is a matter for the government, and I am unwilling to discuss it. However, it may not necessarily increase efficiency. Moreover, the court's actions are based on a vote of the whole, and increasing the number of people will inevitably cause more delays. If the judges are divided into groups to hear cases, it will be difficult to satisfy people, because most of the cases accepted by the Supreme Court are very important, and the decisions of some judges are difficult to satisfy people. Moreover, the constitution clearly stipulates that the judicial power of the United States belongs only to 'one' Supreme Court." Observers believe that the other eight judges, except for Van Devanter and Brandeis, have the same opinion as the Chief Justice. (National News Agency, 22nd)

### Britain and the United States Have Long Established an Understanding on Naval Matters

British Ambassador to Japan Arrives in the United States to Discuss; Warship Construction Plan Proceeds Rapidly

[New York] The new British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, arrived here today aboard the Queen Mary. It is said that this trip is entirely private. When asked about naval issues, Craigie said that Britain and the United States have long understood each other on naval issues, and will continue to pursue a common policy in the future. Craigie denied that he would go to Washington for a meeting, because as far as naval matters are concerned, a tacit understanding has long been established between Washington and London, and there is no need for his mediation. Mr. Craigie also said that although he is known as a naval expert, his appointment as ambassador to Japan this time has no special significance. Mr. Craigie also said that he will return to his country before the coronation of the British King, and then set off for Japan. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Reuters)

[London] The British naval budget was just passed by Parliament on Thursday night, and on Saturday morning the Admiralty had already signed contracts to build several warships. This is very different from previous procedures, as warship construction contracts have always had to wait for Parliament to approve the naval program five or six months later before they are signed. Several warships approved by Parliament last summer were also contracted out to merchants at the end of the week. Among the ships to be built this time, there are five cruisers. In addition, a 23,000-ton aircraft carrier passed on Thursday was approved on Friday afternoon and will be built by a shipyard in Belfast. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Reuters)

[Washington] The U.S. government has signed a contract with the steel industry to supply 7 million tons of steel. Therefore, the Navy Department announced that the warship construction project will no longer feel the lack of steel materials. Seven destroyers and three submarines that have been suspended for a long time will soon be started. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)

[Washington] The Navy Department recently announced that a part of the 1937-38 warship construction program, namely six destroyers and three submarines, which had been delayed due to a lack of steel materials, will now be started immediately. According to the Special Walsh-Healey Act, factories that do not implement a 40-hour work week are not allowed to accept government orders. Therefore, the steel mills agreed not to accept orders in order to resist. As a result, the naval shipyards lacked steel materials. This is the reason why a part of the 1937-38 warship construction program was delayed. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)

[Washington] The Senate recently passed the 1937-38 naval budget with 64 votes to 11. The total amount is $523,000,000. Compared with the number voted by the House of Representatives on the 5th of this month, namely $5,160,000,000, there is a difference. It should be sent back to the House of Representatives for reconsideration. The Senate spent three hours discussing this case today and has already completed it. Senator Minton, a Democrat from Indiana, delivered a speech, advocating that the U.S. government should convene a naval conference to discuss arms limitation. According to the 1937-38 naval construction plan, there are two battleships, eight destroyers, and four submarines. In addition, the two main battleships, three aircraft carriers, eighteen cruisers, forty-eight destroyers, and sixteen submarines listed in the 1936-37 warship construction plan have not yet been completed and should continue to be carried out. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)

[Tokyo] The British government, based on Article 4 of the London Treaty, attempted to limit the caliber of main battleship guns to 14 inches and requested the Japanese government to participate in the agreement. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy Ministry discussed countermeasures. Recently, they reached a consensus and decided on the content of the reply. It has been approved by the cabinet meeting on the 22nd. Foreign Minister Sato is scheduled to instruct the Japanese ambassador to the UK within days to formally reply to the British government. Japan believes that qualitative restrictions without quantitative restrictions cannot achieve the purpose of arms reduction and intends to refuse to participate in the agreement to limit the caliber of guns. According to Article 4 of the London Treaty, if any one of Japan, the UK, the US, France, and Italy does not participate before April 1 of this year, the method of limiting the main battleship guns can be abolished, and the 16-inch caliber can be adopted as before.

### Mussolini Returns to Rome

Delivers Another Harsh Speech

[Rome] Prime Minister Mussolini returned from the North African colony of Libya aboard the cruiser "Pola." He landed at the port of Gaeta at 3:45 PM, immediately changed to a car, and returned here at 5:00 PM. He immediately went to the Palazzo Venezia and began working with cabinet members. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)

[Rome] Today is the 18th anniversary of the founding of Fascism. Celebrations were held throughout the city. Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a stern speech at the Palazzo Venezia, saying that he had returned from Libya one day earlier than scheduled, but the newspapers considered it a mystery, which was disgusting. Mussolini also replied sharply to the inquiries from the Church of England, saying that this kind of wasting ink is no different from the hypocrisy of missionaries. They are always critical of others, but they themselves have been corrupted for thousands of years. Mussolini then spoke of the nine-month economic blockade, saying that the result was the surrender of the blockaders. The blockade showed that pacifists are the real dangerous enemies of peace. Anyone who says that the Italian people are forgetful has made a big mistake. The Italians waited forty years before avenging the humiliation of Adowa. Mussolini concluded in a grand voice, "Black Shirt Comrades, remember it firmly and prepare everything. This is the warning in today's celebration." (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)

[Rome] Well-informed people recently stated that Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg will arrive here on the 25th of this month to visit Prime Minister Mussolini. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)

### Germany Lodges Protest with the Pope

Claims Agreement Will be Terminated

⊙Vatican City. After Pope Pius XI recently issued a letter condemning the German government for violating the 1933 Concordat, the German Ambassador to the Holy See, Pelzer, recently lodged a protest with the Holy See under the instructions of the German government. German sources here also stated that the German government is now considering declaring the Concordat abolished. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)

[Berlin] A semi-official communique was issued today, criticizing the Pope's edict yesterday, calling it "direct interference in Germany's internal affairs." (National News Agency, 23rd)

[Berlin] Yesterday, Pope Pius XI issued a letter criticizing France for violating the 1933 Concordat. All Catholic churches in the country will present and read this letter. Regarding this matter, the French government will decide on its response after the German Ambassador to the Holy See, Pelzer, submits a detailed report on the content of the letter. According to well-informed people, this method can be divided into three types: ① Germany declares its submission and modifies its current religious policy; ② declares the abolition of the Concordat; ③ maintains the status quo without legally breaking with the Holy See. The first method is tantamount to abandoning the important doctrines contained in the book "Mein Kampf," which cannot be accepted by the National Socialist government. Once the second method is implemented, 20 million Catholics in the country will follow the Pope's orders and rise up to fight against the government, which will inevitably cause serious disputes, which the National Socialist government does not want to see. Therefore, judging from the situation, the third method is more credible. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)

### U.S. Elementary School Explosion Tragedy; Principal Faints from Grief During Questioning

Misuse of Gas Pipes to Heat the Room Causes the Disaster

⊙New London. In the case of the elementary school explosion here last Wednesday, the school principal, Mr. Shaw, suddenly fainted today while being questioned in court, because he was weak and overly saddened. At that time, Shaw had admitted that he was responsible for the incident, because he used a certain gas pipe to heat the room without the clear permission of the oil company. According to the foreman of the Parratte Gas Company, the company did not allow anyone to connect the school's gas pipe to the company's residual gas pipe. The school's gas pipe is still being inspected to find the cause of the explosion. Shaw's son also died in the explosion. After fainting in the witness box today, he was carried out of the courtroom.

### Belgian King and British Foreign Secretary Hold Secret Talks

Italian Foreign Minister to Visit Yugoslavia; Small Entente Authorities Busy Receiving

[London] After King Leopold III of Belgium arrived here yesterday, it is reported that he held secret talks with Foreign Secretary Eden last night. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas)

[Rome] Regarding the relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia, rumors that the two sides intend to establish a gentleman's agreement have been denied by the authorities. However, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano is scheduled to go to the capital of Yugoslavia on the 25th of this month. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas)

⊙Prague, Czech Republic. Romanian Prime Minister Tatarescu, accompanied by Vice Minister of National Defense General Glatz, came here for a visit and was received by President Benes. State Prime Minister Hodza set up a banquet to welcome them. Political figures stated that after Tatarescu's visit to the Czech Republic, President Benes will visit Yugoslavia.

It is also said that the Small Entente countries are willing to cooperate economically with other countries in the Danube region. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)

⊙Ankara, Turkey. Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu recently visited Turkey and has returned to his country.

In addition, Romanian State Prime Minister Tatarescu will visit the capital of Turkey before the middle of next month. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas)

### British House of Commons Discusses Air Force Budget

Labour Party Amendment Rejected

[London] The House of Commons today rejected the Labour Party's amendment to the Air Force budget with 202 votes to 106. The gross budget for the Air Force is £18,588,600, and the net budget is £56,500,000, which is £32 million more than last year. During the debate, Minister for Coordination of Defence Inskip replied that the government's military buildup plan is not related to the recent scramble for goods. The scramble for goods is due to world demand and the industrial recovery of the United States, which has led to a sudden shortage of goods. However, the UK had already seen this and had signed contracts in advance. Therefore, the surge in prices has no impact on the contracts signed by the British government, and there will be no impact in peacetime in the future. Churchill said that the number of British aircraft is less than that of other countries, but Inskip said that the government's original plan was to establish 100 aircraft squadrons by mid-April this year. But this level has been slightly exceeded, because on April 1 this year, the UK established 103 aircraft squadrons. However, in terms of equipment, the UK has not yet reached its intended level. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Reuters)

### Tumultuous Situation in Spain Continues

British House of Commons Discusses Italian Troops Assisting in War; Non-Intervention Committee Extended Again

[London] The British government recently received information that on March 5th, a batch of Italian volunteers landed at the port of Cadiz in southern Spain. Because this action violated the February 20th agreement prohibiting volunteers from joining the Spanish conflict, negotiations were initiated with the Italian government. Italy has now submitted an official reply. According to responsible sources, the reply stated that on March 5th, an Italian steamer did arrive at the port of Cadiz, but it carried only a number of volunteer members of a medical corps and medical supplies. The reply did not specify the number of team members. (Havas News Agency dispatch from Havana on the 23rd)

[London] During today's session in the House of Commons, a member inquired about the withdrawal of foreign troops from Spain. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the British government had previously sent notes to the German and Italian governments, requesting a ban on sending foreigners to Spain to participate in the war. Both countries subsequently replied with suggestions. Lord Plymouth had mentioned this matter in the Non-Intervention Committee based on these suggestions, and it is currently under discussion by a necessary committee. A member also asked whether the landing of Italian troops in Spain before February 20th, carrying guns and ammunition to fight against the legitimate government of that country, violated the Non-Intervention Agreement, the Paris Pact, the League of Nations Covenant. The Foreign Secretary replied that if the question referred to the Italian army, then he had not received confirmation of the landing of such troops in Spain. In any case, the issue of violating the Non-Intervention Agreement is a matter for the Non-Intervention Committee itself to consider. As for the other parts of the question, he was not in a position to express an opinion. (Reuters dispatch from London on the 22nd)

[Rome] British Ambassador Sir Drummond visited Foreign Minister Count Ciano yesterday, but according to well-informed sources, the ambassador did not lodge a protest with the Foreign Minister regarding the recent landing of Italian volunteers at a Spanish seaport. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

[London] Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Count Grandi, notified the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee today that Italy is currently disregarding the unconditional discussion of the withdrawal of volunteers. (National News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

[London] The Adjustment Committee of the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Measures was originally scheduled to hold a plenary session at 4:00 PM today to appoint port inspection directors to oversee ship inspections. The candidates had already been determined and were to be selected from foreign nationals from the four countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, who were serving as naval inspectors. According to responsible sources, Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Count Grandi, notified the Chairman of the Adjustment Committee, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Plymouth, this afternoon that he had not yet received instructions from his government regarding the appointment of these inspection directors.

### Japanese Researchers Successfully Develop Fiber from Soybean Hulls

Beneficial for Military Industrial Needs

Dalian Correspondence: The South Manchuria Railway Central Experiment Station has successfully completed research on extracting fiber from soybean hulls produced in Northeast China. It has been confirmed that fiber of 30 to 40 quality can be extracted, and this is also beneficial to the military industry. However, the problem remains that the soybean hulls in Northeast China are mostly used as fuel by farmers during the winter. The question is how to collect a large quantity. The Agriculture and Forestry Section of the South Manchuria Railway's Industrial Department is currently studying an economical collection method. After the study is completed, the location for collecting raw materials will be examined, and then the factory construction site will be determined.

### Amoy Dutch Ship Sinks Fishing Boat

One Death, Losses of Two Thousand Yuan; Java Company Still Denying

Amoy Correspondence: On the 13th, the Amoy Maritime Workers' Union received a report from Zhang Ronghui, a net fishing worker, that on the 9th, he was piloting the fishing boat No. 0928 to Dadan (Amoy port) to cast nets for fishing. On the evening of the 11th, the cook Xie Tianxiang was on watch on the deck. At 3:00 AM on the 12th, the Java Company's MV Wanfushi entered the port from outside, ignoring the port route and heading directly towards the fishing boat. Xie shouted for help on the deck, but the ship ignored him. The fishing boat's nets were in a fixed location and could not be moved to avoid it, causing it to be hit and sunk. Xie Tianxiang fell into the sea and drowned. His body was later recovered with fishing nets. He and another worker escaped from the bottom of the cabin. Because the bow of the boat did not sink, they clung to it until dawn, when they were rescued and taken back by Yu Wendeng's fish transport boat. The wrecked ship sank at that location, with material losses amounting to approximately two thousand yuan. A request was made for assistance in negotiations. The union immediately sent personnel to accompany the water police and the court to Shapotou to inspect Xie's body and sent representatives to negotiate with the Java Company's Chinese comprador, He Fuqing. According to the latter, the ship did not sink a fishing boat that night, and there were other ships entering the port at the same time, such as the Xinhai Men, Taiyuan, and Haiting, so a careful investigation was necessary. On the 14th, the Maritime Workers' Union held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss the matter. It was pointed out that the MV Wanfushi was scheduled to depart for Nanyang on the 14th, and maritime workers would boycott it and not carry passengers or cargo. Later, it was decided that the customs office had records of the ship's time of entry, so the company could not deny it. A report should be submitted to the city party headquarters and the municipal government for negotiations. On the 15th, the Dutch consul visited Mayor Li Shilin and denied that the fishing boat was sunk by the MV Wanfushi, and the Java Company would not bear any responsibility. Li replied that he had not yet received a report from the boat union and that the truth was not clear. On the 17th, the Amoy Customs Chief Inspector, together with representatives from the Maritime Workers' Union, conducted a detailed on-site investigation. As a result, sufficient evidence was obtained to confirm the facts, and a report was submitted to the Customs Commissioner for handling. The Maritime Workers' Union also decided on the same day to send a letter to the Java Company, setting out the conditions required. If there was no satisfactory reply within two days, effective measures would be taken. (March 19)

### Shandong Province Strives for Rural Construction

Actively Training Rural Service Personnel; Rural Construction Vocational School to Be Improved

Jinan Correspondence: In recent years, Governor Han of Shandong Province has been striving for rural construction, recognizing that the countryside is the foundation of the nation. To ensure the long-term stability of the country, it is necessary to start with rural construction, enlighten its intelligence, tighten its organization, restore its economic condition, and increase its self-defense capabilities, aiming for prosperity and strength. Those in charge of this matter include Liang Shuming, Liang Zhonghua, Tang Maoru, etc. All work, such as establishing administrative inspectorate districts, promoting rural agricultural schools and village agricultural schools, etc., has now achieved results in education and self-defense. Seven special commissioner districts have been established, incorporating 68 counties, and are actively in progress. However, there is a great lack of personnel for this rural service, and even with intensified training, the supply still falls short of demand. The current status of the three institutions for training rural service personnel, the Rural Construction Research Institute, the Rural Service Personnel Training Center, and the Rural Construction Vocational School, is described as follows: The Rural Construction Research Institute is located in Zouping, headed by Liang Shuming, with a branch in Heze. The institute is divided into a research department and a training department. Graduates of the institute have long been assigned to rural service in various counties of the first, second, and third administrative districts and have achieved considerable success. Subsequently, two rural construction normal schools were established in Zouping and Heze counties to cultivate teachers and continue to distribute them for service.

Rural Service Training Center: Last year, due to the lack of rural service personnel, the provincial government established the Rural Service Training Center for Normal Students in Jining, gathering graduating public and joint normal school students to provide short-term training. Another training center for female normal school students was established in Zouping to train female students. After training, they were assigned to practice in rural areas. The newly established fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh administrative inspectorate districts and counties are promoting rural agricultural schools, mostly served by graduates of this program. The Normal School Student Training Center has now been reorganized into the Rural Service Personnel Training Center, as a permanent institution, headed by Governor Han himself as the director.

Rural Construction Vocational School: This school was formed by merging the Rural Normal School and the Senior Agricultural Vocational School, and the principal is Tang Maoru. It was established last year. According to regulations, when each province establishes a vocational school, it must first determine the curriculum and report it to the Ministry of Education for approval before recruiting students. The school did not submit the curriculum last year and first recruited 100 students. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education did not approve it, so only 13 people were recruited. Two people did not arrive at the start of the semester, and others gradually withdrew, so there are only eight people now. Recently, Xie Shuying, a supervisor from the Ministry of Education, came to Jinan to inspect higher education and first paid attention to the school. Because the school had too few vocational students, but the faculty and staff numbered 17, with annual expenses of 50,000 yuan, it was too uneconomical. Furthermore, the curriculum of the school's rural normal school, senior agricultural school, and rural construction vocational school was not well-integrated, and there were criticisms. Improvements were urged to be made quickly. (March 22)

Preparations are actively underway.

### Suzhou

Western Clothing Industry Petitions for Relief

The Suzhou County Western Clothing Industry Association reported that since silk and cloth shops established western clothing departments, their business has been encroached upon and they have been affected. Now, the secondhand clothing shops are also making and selling western clothes at low prices. For the sake of the livelihood of over a thousand workers, they request assistance. The association convened a meeting and decided to appoint Chairman Li Zengyong and others to petition the county party headquarters on the 12th. On the 23rd, they went to the county chamber of commerce to request relief. In order to resolve the dispute, the chamber of commerce decided to convene responsible persons from both sides to the meeting at 10:00 AM today (24th) to inquire about the details and then handle it accordingly.

Suzhou-Wuxi Road Commercially Operated Transportation

Preparations are currently underway, and the official opening is scheduled for mid-April. It is said that the ticket prices will be slightly different from the trial period.

### Wuxi

Bandits Rob Small Ferry

In order to facilitate passengers, the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company has specially opened a joint ferry service between Hujia Ferry in the fifth district and Qianzhou, running four times a day to pick up and drop off passengers. One day at 6:00 PM, the small ferry departed from Hujia Ferry to Qianzhou as usual. Around 7:00 PM, when it arrived at Zhongqiao Wharf, two bandits suddenly disguised themselves as passengers and claimed that they needed to go to Zhang Dadi Temple in Xitang, Qianzhou, to watch a play. The driver of the boat did not suspect anything. When the boat approached the Yangchepeng area, the bandits pulled out handguns and fired two shots into the river as a warning, prohibiting anyone from making a sound. They then carried out a large-scale robbery. As a result, none of the twenty or so passengers were spared. Those who were wearing expensive clothes were stripped of them. The total loss amounted to over two hundred yuan. After obtaining the stolen goods, the bandits jumped ashore and fled towards Qianzhou. On the morning of the 22nd, the Xicheng Company reported the incident to the County Police Bureau for investigation. It was found that the small ferry had been robbed once before on the 7th of this month at Linzhuang Bridge. This was the second time. The future of public security is worrying.

### Zhenjiang

Construction of Riverside Wharves

The Jiangsu Department of Construction believes that the construction of important riverside wharves is of great importance to local transportation. The province's Jiangbei and Jiangnan areas are separated by the Yangtze River, which makes it very inconvenient to implement government orders and transport goods. It is planned to build deep-water docks in Yangzhou and Kouan in Jiangbei, as well as Zhenjiang's riverside, and to manufacture car ferry boats, so that the Jiangnan and Jiangbei highways can be connected to each other.

Control of Cotton Seeds in Reclamation Areas

In order to increase production and eliminate inferior varieties, the Jiangsu Province Cotton Production Improvement Office will implement control of cotton seeds in reclamation areas this year. It has selected excellent cotton seeds from various cotton areas in Henan and Shandong and transported them back, and formulated measures to lend them out separately. The seeding has been allocated by area and zones, and model cotton production areas will be established in Nantong's Sanyu Town Dayou Jin District, Dongtai's Xinfeng Town, Dafeng District, and the Yancheng-Nantong University base production area to further promote cotton planting.

### Nantong

The Zhushan to Renshan area in the eastern countryside of Xiaoshan has suffered from tidal disasters for many years. During the 14th year of the Republic of China, Shen Dingyi proposed building a dike to resist the tides and building a diversion dam in Renshan. The force of the Qiantang River was diverted northward, so tens of thousands of acres of new sand land were added. Later, a second earthen dike was built outside the old dike. Until last year, local gentry and others from Kanshan built a third earthen dike on the newly accreted sand land. Recently, there have been continuous spring rains, and the upper river flow is pouring down, causing severe erosion. The newly built earthen dike has begun to collapse. Generally ignorant people are still planting crops in the old dike area, loosening the sides of the dike. Once the dike body is loose, the river water will inevitably enter the interior, and the harm will be great. Recently, it has had a considerable impact on the entire Nansha area. In the future, it may become a place for fish and turtles.

### Mayor Wu Arrived at the Municipal Government Yesterday

Instructed Subordinates to Hurry Up and Finish Up; Departure Date to Guangdong Not Yet Determined

According to the Central News Agency, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng has been internally appointed as the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government. Mayor Wu was summoned to Nanjing to receive instructions a few days ago. He returned to Shanghai the night before last. At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, he went to the municipal government to handle important official matters and instructed his subordinates to prepare to finish up. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mayor Wu at the municipal government yesterday afternoon. The mayor was extremely busy handling official matters. The date of departure for Guangdong has not yet been determined. Various public organizations have sent telegrams to Beijing to urge him to stay. The details are as follows:

Charitable Organizations

The Joint Disaster Relief Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan yesterday, saying: To President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng has responded to the call of the times and established a great foundation. In his six years in Shanghai, his political achievements have been remarkable. Not only is he loved by the citizens, but he is also admired by Chinese and foreigners alike. Just as we were hoping that his talents would be further developed and that he would bring great happiness to the people's livelihood, we suddenly heard that he was being transferred to govern Guangdong. We are filled with regret and reluctance. Rather than having to think of him after he has left, we dare to plead with him to stay. We respectfully telegraph to urge him to stay. We beseech you to consider our request. Wang Zhen, Zhu Qinglan, Qu Yingguang, Huang Qingrun, Qian Yingqing, Tao Tongjie, Xie Jiaqian, from the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, respectfully.

Local Association

Telegraphed to Beijing yesterday, saying: To Chairman Jiang of Nanjing, Mayor Wu has been in Shanghai for six years, and his political achievements have been remarkable. The people are grateful and admire him. According to reports, the Executive Yuan's 305th meeting decided to transfer him to Guangdong Province. The central government has its own considerations in replacing high officials, but we believe that Shanghai is at the forefront of the Jianghai and has always been a bustling place. We sincerely request that you consider the special circumstances and withdraw the order. We cannot help but hope and pray. We respectfully telegram to you and respectfully ask for your consideration. The Shanghai Local Association, respectfully.

Postal Workers Union

Telegraphed to Beijing yesterday, saying: To the Nanjing Central Political Committee and the Executive Yuan, Since Mayor Wu Tiecheng took office in Shanghai and presided over municipal administration, it has been more than six years. He has straightened out discipline and clarified laws. He has displayed grand plans for developing prosperity and utilization, and he has shouldered the heavy responsibility of delegating great responsibilities. His plans have been welcomed by the people, and his reputation has grown daily. The people's livelihood has been entrusted to him. Just as we were hoping for gradual progress, so that he could fulfill his talents, we recently learned that the central government has issued an order to transfer him to govern Guangdong. The people of Shanghai are deeply disturbed. We believe that Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreign commerce converges. In terms of geography, it supports the capital. In terms of finance, it is the economic center of the country. Not to mention the dense population of commoners, workers, and merchants, it is not enough to govern this place without a person who is wholeheartedly devoted, and has the talent to manage ten thousand affairs. Since Mayor Wu has been in Shanghai, he has prospered the city and established industry and commerce. His political achievements have been recognized both at home and abroad. Now, if he is transferred suddenly, the interconnected facilities will inevitably be changed, and the great achievements of past management will be feared to be abandoned at once. Therefore, without avoiding offense, we earnestly express our words. We respectfully request that you comply with public opinion and withdraw the order, and appoint another high official to preside over Guangdong. In haste, we cannot express enough the extent of our apprehension and anticipation. The Shanghai Postal Workers Union, respectfully.

### Zhang Qun Arrived in Shanghai

### Grand Geshe of Tibet, Shira Gyatso, Arrives in Shanghai

Invited to Beijing to lecture at Five Universities

Special Report from This Newspaper: In order to facilitate communication between Tibetan and Han cultures, the central authorities have specially invited the Grand Geshe (equivalent to a Ph.D. title) Shira Gyatso of the Zhepang Monastery in Tibet (formerly translated as Xi Dan Jia Su) to Beijing to lecture at the Central University, Peiping University, Wuhan University, Zhongshan University, and Tsinghua University. He arrived in Shanghai the night before last aboard the British ship "Jahana" with a group of 21 people, including Li Dan of the Supervisory Committee, the Mongolian-Tibetan pilgrimage delegation he organized, his disciple Guanba Serkhutuktu, Geshe Garsang Gyatso, Dalai Lama's Gujiatutannanzhuo, and Supervisory Committee member Li Dan. Due to the long journey, Mr. Xi is resting in Shanghai for a day. Because of the importance attached to Mr. Xi's visit, visitors have been arriving all day, especially groups of reporters, leaving Grand Master Xi and Committee Member Li with little rest. Mr. Li's secretary, Yang Zhifu, has been particularly busy, translating for the Grand Master and talking to reporters from various newspapers, with almost no time to spare. During Mr. Yang's busy schedule, the writer was able to speak freely. What was discussed is recorded below:

### Shira Gyatso

Brief Biography of Mr. Shira: Grand Master Shira Gyatso is originally from Qinghai. He went to Tibet at a young age and became a famous Tibetan master. His writings and morals are highly respected by the Tibetan people, and he has more than 10,000 disciples. He is famous throughout Tibet and has a considerable status in the world.

Journey Schedule: He set off from Tibet on February 8th, arrived in India on February 24th, sailed from India on February 28th, arrived in Hong Kong on March 16th, and sailed from Hong Kong on the 19th, arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The journey took more than one and a half months.

### Li Dan

Meeting Foreign Guests En Route: During Mr. Xi's trip to Beijing, when he passed through Kalimpong, India, British expert on Tibetan affairs, McDonald, came to visit. When he arrived in Calcutta, the Indian International University held a special welcome meeting and invited him to visit the school. He was also invited by the bhikkhunis of the Indian Buddhist organization Maha Bodhi Society to give a sermon. When he visited the sacred sites of Buddhagaya (the place called Vajrasana, where Sakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment) and boarded the ship from Calcutta, Sir Francis Younghusband, who led the British expeditionary force into Tibet in the Jia Chen year of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, personally boarded the ship to visit and said to Mr. Jia, "We have organized this travel association to come to India specifically to study Buddhism, because the world today is full of wars and unrest, and there is no peace. Only by promoting Buddhism can we save the world from this catastrophe. We deeply hope that Buddhism will be widely promoted to save the world. It would be a great honor for Grand Geshe to visit England, and we will pray for it." At the same time, American scholar Mr. Theos C. Bernard also came to the ship to request an audience and said, "The United States also highly respects Buddhism now and hopes that Grand Geshe will visit the United States to widely promote Buddhism for the benefit of all beings." The Geshe replied, "I also wish to visit your country. Your visit is truly a good opportunity, because the phrase 'do no harm to sentient beings' is not only for world peace, but also what my Buddha preaches. Whether I am in Tibet, in China, or in my hometown preaching, I always take this as my firm and unchangeable principle. I have long wanted to visit your country, but I have not been able to go due to circumstances, which I regret." He then left his contact information, hoping to communicate often.

Grand Master's Sermon: Reporters from various newspapers asked Grand Master Shira Gyatso to talk about the history of Tibetan culture. The Grand Master straightened his yellow robe, sat down, and spoke in Tibetan, which was translated by Mr. Yang Zhifu. The main points are recorded below:

Relationship between Han and Tibet: Buddhism originated with the incarnation of Sakyamuni Buddha and first flourished in India. Therefore, India can be said to be the birthplace of Buddhism. It was introduced to China during the Han Dynasty and to Tibet during the Tang Dynasty. The beginning of the introduction of Buddhism into Tibet was the time when Chinese Buddhism flourished. After the Song Dynasty, Chinese Buddhism gradually declined, and Tibetan Buddhism revived. At the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, Sakya Banqing of Tibet and his nephew Pagpa were invited, and relations with the Sakya sect developed. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, Halima and others were invited, and relations with the Kagyu sect developed. At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, the new sect of Tibetan Buddhism (the Yellow Sect) was revitalized. Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty invited the founder of the new sect, Grand Master Tsongkhapa, but the Grand Master was unable to come in person and sent his chief disciple, Sakya Yeshe, leading to relations with the new sect. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the Fifth Dalai Lama came to China, and the relationship with the new sect of Tibetan Buddhism became even deeper, and politically they were united as one. It has been like this for 600 years. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, many Tibetan scholars have come to the mainland, but I am the first to be formally invited by the central government. Therefore, I can truly be said to be the first. This is the general situation of the relationship between Buddhism and the Han and Tibetan peoples.

Significant Significance: I feel that this invitation from the central government is of great significance, because from the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty, they were all "imperial teachers" or "national teachers." Because the Tibetans came to the mainland and lived in the palace, preaching to one person, the relationship was extremely small. This time, I was ordered by the central government to lecture at five national universities, which is truly to facilitate communication between Tibetan and Han cultures. Although I am an unlearned person, I will make efforts to promote this as my goal in the future.

Not a Representative: I am very surprised that the newspapers in this city report that I am a representative of the Hotreng Khutuktu of Tibet. This news is not only untrue, but I have never even dreamed of it. Please pay attention to this point.

Mr. Li's Remarks: After the Grand Master finished speaking, the writer asked Supervisory Committee member Li Dan about his trip to the west. Mr. Li is 67 years old this year and is in unusually good spirits. According to him, the Mongolian-Tibetan pilgrimage delegation he organized took four years, including the journey. When they went, they passed through Gansu and Qinghai to Tibet, which took a year. They traveled through hundreds of miles of uninhabited areas. It took three months to travel from Gansu to Tibet. Fortunately, they had animals to ride on the way. After arriving in Tibet, they immediately engaged in research on Tibetan culture with Shira Gyatso. (The rest is omitted)

### Mayor Wu Hosted Lunch and Dinner Yesterday for the German and Japanese Consuls General

Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a lunch at his residence yesterday to bid farewell to the German Consul General in Shanghai, Kriebel, who is about to return to his country, and his wife. In the evening, he also hosted a dinner at his residence for the Japanese Consul General Kawasai to socialize. High-ranking officials from the consulates and city government officials were invited to accompany them, and the atmosphere was extremely pleasant.

### Cigarette Factory Representatives Petition in Beijing

Submitting to the Relevant Ministries and Departments

According to reports, the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association is concerned about the possibility of increased taxes. Since this concerns national tax revenue and the survival of the industry, an emergency meeting was convened in the association yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. Representatives from various factories attended, including Hua Cheng Shen Xingde, Cui Zhong Shen Weiting, Wang Ruilin, Hua Mei Jing Yimeng, Sun Daosheng, Fu Xin Ge Xiongfu, Qiu Tanglin, He Xing Wu Linzhe, Nanyang Liang Zhidong, Hua Pin Gu Zhongying, Li Xing Bao Gengsheng, Jiang Zhe Liu Jiyun, Da Dong Sun Lishan, Da Dongnan Zhang Xinliang, Hua Dong Li Xuedong, De Long Wang Weiguan, De Xing Le Nanting, Zhong He Yu Banqin, Rui Lun Wang Xingtang, and Zhong Nan Shen YanKang. Chairman Shen Weiting presided over the meeting. Proposition 1: In light of recent reports of further tax increases, how should we respond? Decision: At present, smuggled cigarettes are rampant, and the timing is especially inappropriate for further tax increases during the rainy season. Representatives should be sent to Beijing to petition the Central Political Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Tax Administration to maintain the status quo and avoid tax increases. Shen Xingde, Shen Weiting, Jing Yimeng, Liang Zhidong, Bao Gengsheng, and Ge Xiongfu were appointed as representatives to petition in Beijing that evening. Proposition 2: Should the date of this year's annual members' meeting be postponed? Decision: This year's annual members' meeting was originally scheduled for April 10th, but during this period of tax increases, the members are very busy and have no time for this. It should be postponed, and the date of the meeting will be determined later.

### British Acting Consul General Davidson Has Assumed Office

### The Shanghai Municipal Council's Board of Directors Will Discuss Increasing the General Rate Today

Chinese Directors Met Yesterday to Discuss Rejecting the Proposal; All Sectors Expressed Strong Opposition

According to the New Voice Society, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has been planning to increase the municipal general rate by 16 percent for a long time. All sectors are deeply concerned that once this is implemented, they will not be able to bear the burden and have expressed their opposition. However, the Municipal Council has not withdrawn this proposed tax increase. It is now known that the council will discuss and decide on this matter at today's board meeting, and it seems determined to implement it. Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and Xu Xinliu, the Chinese directors attending the Municipal Council, attach great importance to this matter. They held a meeting yesterday evening, but the content is unknown. However, if the issue of tax increase is raised at today's board meeting, the Chinese directors will have a serious debate in order to reject the proposal, which can be inferred. It is subtly rumored that the Japanese directors also hold an opposing attitude and are very determined.

Various Trade Associations Strive on Just Grounds

More than 150 trade associations in the city, including real estate, new medicine, pharmaceutical, tea, soy sauce, southern goods, salted fish, timber, fruit, jewelry, seafarers, Western clothing, cosmetics, Chinese and foreign groceries, and more than ten native place associations such as Nantong, Haimen, Jiading, Ningbo, Zhenjiang, and Sichuan, jointly sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday, stating that the Municipal Council's attempt to increase the municipal general rate at this time is tantamount to deliberately harming industry and commerce, making it impossible for the market to improve. The council should recognize that many residents are unable to pay the house rate quarterly and are accumulating arrears, and the number of cases being filed in the courts is increasing daily. If the Municipal Council implements the tax increase, industry and commerce will decline, and vacant houses will increase, which will not benefit the revenue, but will only increase the suffering of the citizens. Therefore, if the Municipal Council sincerely wants to solve the financial difficulties, it should thoroughly eliminate waste in expenditure and implement austerity. As far as we know, the exchange allowance given to Western employees of the council amounts to more than 1.6 million yuan per year, the music team costs 260,000 yuan per year, and the unnecessary White Russian team in the International Settlement Volunteer Corps also costs 170,000 yuan per year. The police expenses of the police department were 5.58 million yuan in 1929, and have increased to 9.9 million yuan this year, an increase of 4 million yuan in these years, which is shocking. Moreover, if the council could employ more Chinese employees, the savings in expenditure would be even more considerable. However, the council does not consider this and wants to solve the financial difficulties by increasing taxes. Not to mention that this policy of seeking fish from trees is of no practical benefit, but will only cause unfortunate serious consequences, so we must warn the council in advance and urge them to strive on just grounds and not allow it to become a reality.

Sub-Districts Resolutely Oppose

The First Special District Citizens' Association, upon learning that the Municipal Council intends to increase the municipal general rate, issued a declaration stating the reasons why the tax increase should not be implemented, requesting the Municipal Council to prioritize the livelihood of the citizens and withdraw the proposed tax increase. However, the Municipal Council has not adopted any expression. It is now known that all sub-districts of the association will issue a joint declaration within the day, absolutely supporting the association's position and firmly expressing their opposition.

### People from All Walks of Life Support Zhongshan Hospital

Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony at its Maple Bridge site on April 1st of this year. Recently, many enthusiastic sponsors from all walks of life have donated souvenirs and supplies, including a refrigerator from Wing On Company, an electric stove for the kitchen from Mr. Anderlo, a velvet curtain for the auditorium from the graduating students of the National Shanghai Medical College, a piano from the students in school, a Cantley & Eltor wireless radio, a plaque from Minister Kong Yongzhi, 500 yuan in national currency from Shanghai Cement Company, 500 yuan for the purchase of dining utensils from the Chinese Medical Association, a full set of wooden furniture for the reception room from Sen Tai Construction Company, a short-wave electrotherapy device from Dr. Niu Huisheng and his wife (loaned), ophthalmological equipment from China Optical Company, bedding from the Chinese Women's Association, kitchen utensils from Mr. Zou Gengsheng, a carpet from Mrs. Lan Ansheng, a full set of sterilizers from Harmon & Co., 200 yuan in national currency from Ren Li Earth Carpet Company, and a cylinder of a laughing gas for the anesthesia room from Sin Yi Pharmaceutical Factory.

### Municipal Party Department Held a Memorial Meeting for the Martyrdom of Deng Zhongyuan Yesterday

Attended by More Than 100 Representatives from All Walks of Life

The Municipal Party Department convened representatives from all walks of life yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to hold a memorial meeting for the 15th anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Deng Zhongyuan, presided over by Xing Wan, a member of the Municipal Party Department.

The entire city flew flags at half-mast to express grief.

Chairman's Report: After the chairman, Xing Wan, led the ceremony, Xing Wan gave a report, stating that Mr. Deng Zhongyuan died for the revolution and sacrificed himself for the country 15 years ago today. Among the deeds of Mr. Deng's life, what is most admirable is his revolutionary spirit, his love of learning, his integrity, and his love of the party. These four spirits should be emulated by all our comrades. Now that the country is engaged in the great task of recovery, all our compatriots should emulate Mr. Deng's spirit to make the country and the nation prosperous and strong, so that we can live up to the meaning of commemorating Mr. Deng today.

Memorial Slogans: After the chairman's report, the slogans were shouted: (1) The spirit of Mr. Deng Zhongyuan will never die! (2) Emulate Mr. Deng's great personality! (3) Inherit Mr. Deng's revolutionary spirit! (4) Long live the Three Principles of the People! (5) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! (6) Long live the Republic of China!

### Kodama Kenji Expressed Regret After the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Published an Editorial

In Reality, Both Sides' Opinions Were Very Harmonious

Kodama Kenji, who came to China to discuss Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, spoke about the editorial published by the Asahi Shimbun yesterday morning, saying, "The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an editorial on the 22nd entitled 'Adjusting the Problems of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations.' Although I have not seen the full text, based on the telegram from the Allied News Agency, its content is completely contrary to the impressions and conversations we had in Nanjing and Shanghai. I think the newspaper's editorial is based on speculative opinions, and I am very concerned that it will cause misunderstandings among the general public, which is quite regrettable. In fact, the talks between the two sides were very harmonious, and the future effects can be fully expected." Kodama went out to visit friends yesterday morning and also attended social events. He is scheduled to return to China on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru on the 27th.

### Kato Went North Yesterday Morning to Investigate; Japanese Investigation Team Disbanded

Hori Shin, the president of Nisshin Kisen, also left Shanghai the day before yesterday, reportedly flying to Hankou and then to Chongqing. Kato Risaburo, the president of the Bank of Korea, left Shanghai on a China National Aviation Corporation plane at 6:30 yesterday morning and flew to Qingdao to transfer to Tianjin and Beijing to investigate the economic situation in North China. Miyatake Hyotaro, the former chairman of the board of directors of Mitsubishi Corporation, Toyota Risaburo, the president of Toyota Spinning, Akiyama Ukishi, an advisor to Mitsubishi Goshi Kaisha, and Yutani Kyoichi, the managing director of the Japan-China Trade Association, and others, took the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru at 9:00 yesterday morning and went directly back to their country.

### Municipal Police Department Granted Permission by Military Commission to Continue Citywide Registration of Opium Smokers

Opium Smokers Found to Have Harmful Additives Sent to Relevant Departments for Legal Action; Fourth Phase of License Renewal Scheduled to Begin on the First of Next Month

According to the Ta Kung She, Dai Lizhen, the chief of the Anti-Opium Section of the Police Department, stated yesterday that since the department began registering opium smokers on April 1st of the year before last, a total of more than 40,000 opium smokers have been registered. The department has issued licenses and gradually reduced the amount of opium they smoke in accordance with the law. However, since the registration ended at the end of December last year, in recent times, the various police sub-bureaus have found a large number of opium smokers without licenses, and due to the administrative relations of the concessions, they cannot implement prosecution. In order to be tolerant of opium smokers without licenses and give them an opportunity to reform, the bureau has obtained the approval of the Chief Supervisor of the Anti-Opium General Supervision Department of the Military Commission to continue the registration of opium smokers. They are currently preparing the registration procedures, which are expected to begin next month.

Additives Verified in Opium Smokers Who Have Quit

The work of testing opium smokers who have quit began at the beginning of this month. The Anti-Opium Section of the bureau has tested and forced rehabilitation on more than 18,000 opium smokers. They first identified 2,000 people and ordered the bureaus and sub-bureaus to test them separately. It is said that after the test, more than 20 people were found to have harmful non-addictive substances, and they have been sent to the garrison headquarters for punishment in accordance with military law. As for the second phase of testing, it is scheduled to begin on the first of next month.

Scheduled to Begin Exchanging Licenses

The fourth phase of licenses for registered opium smokers will expire at the end of this month. The Anti-Opium Section of the bureau has numbered the more than 40,000 registered opium smokers and indicated the amount of opium they smoke, and will begin exchanging licenses on April 1st. At that time, opium smokers will be notified. As for reducing the amount of opium they smoke, it has also been drafted, and it will be implemented as soon as it is approved by the Anti-Opium General Supervision Department.

### Jiao Yitang Came to Shanghai to Raise Funds for the National Medical Center

Hosted a Banquet for Business and Charitable Circles the Night Before Last

Central Committee member Jiao Yitang has always been enthusiastic about promoting the cause of Chinese medicine. Recently, he and Central Committee members Sun Zhesheng, Yu Youren, Feng Huanzhang, Chen Lifu, and others initiated the organization of the Capital National Hospital, planning to recruit experts for concentrated research. However, the National Hospital is a pioneering project, and the equipment is planned to be perfect, so fundraising is quite difficult. In January of this year, Mr. Jiao invited giants in the medical and pharmaceutical circles in Shanghai to raise funds in various ways, raising more than 60,000 yuan, which is far from enough. It is now known that Mr. Jiao hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel the day before yesterday to invite Shanghai business, industry, charitable organizations to raise funds again, so that it can be completed as soon as possible. All circles in Shanghai expressed their sympathy. Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jingren, Wang Yiting, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Guo Shun, Wang Boqi, Wu Yunxu, Su Pei Shao, and hundreds of other guests attended. During the banquet, Mr. Jiao delivered a speech, stating that the Capital National Hospital was initiated by Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, President Sun Zhesheng, President Yu Youren, Vice Chairman Feng Yuxiang, and others, with the purpose of promoting the effectiveness of Chinese medicine and improving the health of the people. In January of this year, he hosted a banquet for the Shanghai medical and pharmaceutical circles and expressed his opinions on raising funds for the National Hospital. Today, he continues to express his opinions and specially invites Shanghai business, industry, and charitable circles to guide and support him, so that it can be completed as soon as possible. Chinese medicine was left to us by our ancestors. Since the government promulgated the regulations on Chinese medicine, Chinese medicine has been protected by law. The Third Plenary Session passed the methods for medical schools. The Central National Medical Center has recently opened training classes to organize Chinese medicine and progress gradually, which can be expected day by day. However, without the establishment of the National Hospital, it cannot be perfected. Therefore, he and the members of the Beijing Central Committee initiated the National Hospital, and the Central Committee agreed to allocate 150,000 yuan for construction. However, this is for the welfare of the people, and some of the funds are planned to be raised from all walks of life in order to make the various equipment perfect. In this way, the Chinese medical community will have statistics on the treatment of diseases for practical research, and its development will be easier. Recently, there have been more than ten Chinese medicine branches in Western countries, which shows that the world is also researching Chinese medicine. Therefore, the establishment of the National Hospital in our country is even more urgent. I sincerely hope that Shanghai's business, industrial, and charitable circles will give their support. Then, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, stating that Chinese medicine has a long history. He suffers from diseases and always takes Chinese medicine. Last year, when he was ill, he asked Chinese medicine doctor Wang Zhongqi to prescribe medicine and never took Western medicine. Now I have regained my health, which shows the miraculous effect of Chinese medicine. Therefore, I am very sympathetic to the筹设 of the Capital National Hospital and sincerely hope that everyone will support the good deeds of Committee Member Jiao, one to preserve the national essence and one to improve the health of the people. After the speech, the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.

### Hainan Island Investigation Team Scheduled to Depart

Gathering in Hong Kong Before Mid-April

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in order to promote the development of Hainan Island, has formed a Hainan Island Industrial Investigation Team with the chambers of commerce in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, scheduled to gather in Hong Kong on April 15th to depart. The Chamber of Commerce has notified various industries to send representatives to participate. It is now known that the participants in the investigation team from this city include Xiao Zongjun from Sincere Company, Chen Xiaodie from Family Industrial Society, Huang Juechen from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Chen Wenming from the Chinese Herbal Medicine Association, and others. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, will also go to inspect. If representatives from various industries wish to join, they can report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce before the end of this month for preparation. According to Yan E'sheng, secretary of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Hainan Island has abundant resources and many products. In terms of 25 years, the net value of imported foreign goods such as foreign rice, kerosene, milk, foreign paper, iron bars, and teak is only more than 4 million yuan, while the value of exported goods is more than 5.77 million yuan, with a trade surplus of more than 1 million yuan. Local sugar is particularly dominant. In the 24th year, only more than 40,000 yuan were exported, while in the 25th year, more than 77,000 packages have been exported, and there are still many to be exported. The total output is estimated to be more than 100,000 packages. The area has no violent hurricanes throughout the year, and overseas Chinese remit 20 million yuan every year, so the future is promising.

### Polish Sinologist Xia Bailong Arrives in Shanghai

Hosted a Welcome Banquet by the Council of the Sino-Polish Cultural Association Yesterday

The Polish Ministry of Education sent Xia Bailong, a Chinese culture professor at the Warsaw Oriental Institute, to China last year to investigate Chinese culture for a period of one year. Mr. Xia and his wife (a linguist) set off at the beginning of the year and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday via England. It is reported that Mr. Xia taught at Tsinghua University for two years and can speak fluent Mandarin. Yesterday, he was hosted a banquet at the Huibinlou by the council of the Sino-Polish Cultural Association. Xie Shoukang delivered a welcome speech. Mr. Xia replied that Europe knows a lot about China in the old aspect, but few know about the new China. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to study modern China in addition to studying ancient Chinese culture, so as to gain a deeper understanding and introduce it to my country in a powerful way. Mr. Xia will leave Shanghai tomorrow (25th) and go to Nanjing via Nanjing.

### Strike of Child Laborers at the British Candle Factory Resolved

Workers at the British Candle Factory on Robison Road in West Shanghai demanded improved treatment. After the company responded and accepted part of the demands, the child laborers went on strike again the day before because their goals were not achieved, which affected all work. Yesterday morning, after persuasion from the general representative Ma Jun and others, they returned to work at 7 AM. They had proposed three conditions: ⑴ A retirement bonus of one month for each year of service for those who have worked for three years (the company previously agreed to one month for each year for those over 45 years old). ⑵ An increase in wages of 2.5 cents per hundred boxes (wages of $5 should be given per week). ⑶ If the factory hires new child laborers, the old child laborers should be promoted to work in other departments (because the age of the child laborers in the factory is 40 or 50 years old, and the wages of child laborers are lower than those of workers in other departments). At 2 PM, the representative Ma Jun went to the factory to negotiate. He was received by the foreman Ma Jiexun. As a result of the negotiations: ⑴ The retirement bonus will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Asia General Company. ⑵ Wages will be increased by another 5 cents per hundred boxes. ⑶ If the factory hires child laborers, old child laborers will be allowed to be promoted to work in other departments. This dispute has temporarily come to an end.

### Competition between British, American, and Japanese Shipping Routes Stimulates Chinese Shipping Industry

The Japanese Shanghai Daily reports that in this quasi-war era of the world, the world shipping industry is therefore reflecting on and striving to expand shipping routes. The activities of the two major currents of Japanese shipping, Nippon Yusen and Osaka Shosen, and the advances of Kawasaki, Mitsui, Yamashita, and Daido, are indeed a force to be reckoned with. Building new ships or extending routes is attracting worldwide attention. Therefore, in order to counter this, foreign shipping companies are building large ships. Competition between domestic and foreign ships is becoming increasingly fierce in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Shanghai, as a relay port for new shipping routes, is also a central hub for competition among these new and sharp vessels. Its international position will become even more important in the future. Therefore, the Chinese shipping industry, in view of this trend, is also receiving considerable stimulation. The eight regulations for consolidating the shipping industry stipulated by the Ministry of Communications are being actively implemented. China Merchants Bureau is pouring all its efforts into developing long-distance ocean routes and securing the Nanhua Line in order to compete with the British, American, and Japanese shipping industries.

### Sino-Polish Cultural Association Prepared to Hold Art Exhibition in Poland

### Kidnapping Case in Qingpu: Kidnappers and Hostage Transferred

### Another Water Thief, Yin Xiaosanzi, Arrested

Stealing Items from a Westerner on a British Ship

The notorious water thief, Dabaozi (nicknamed Water Rat), has many accomplices who specialize in stealing clothing from various Chinese and foreign ships. Since being arrested by the Water Police and sent to court, his accomplices have become slightly less active. The day before, Yin Xiaosanzi (a 30-year-old from Zhenjiang), also of the Water Rat type, sneaked onto the British ship Corsar at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou and stole a pair of glasses worth 3 pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence in British currency, and twelve copper coins from a Westerner's room. When he was about to leave the room with the stolen goods, he was caught by a Westerner, who twisted him around, searched him, and found the stolen goods. He was sent to the Water Police Station. After interrogation by the head constable, it was confirmed that he was also a water thief. Yesterday afternoon, Detective Gu Wenkui transferred the thief to the local court. The duty inspector conducted a preliminary trial for a week and ordered him to be detained pending prosecution.

### Li Lanbao Was Lured to Shanghai and Sold into Prostitution

Three Women Detained Pending Sentencing

Li Lanbao, an 18-year-old woman from Suzhou, lived in her hometown of Tongli. She was married to Li Quansheng. In November of the lunar calendar last year, she was lured to Shanghai by Wang A'hai and Xiang Heshang, fellow villagers, and hidden at Chen Ding's and Yang Liu's residence at No. 51 Jingyuan Street. Later, she was sold to Li Zhu, a woman from Wuxi who opened a brothel at No. 37 Beihai Road, for 150 yuan to work as a prostitute. Recently, Li Lanbao's aunt, Li Lin, learned of this and rushed to Shanghai the day before yesterday to report the situation to the Laozha Police Station, which ordered Detective Lai Yusi to go to Jingyuan Street, Beihai Road, etc., and successively arrested the three women Li Zhu, Chen Ding, and Yang Liu, and took them back to the police station for detention. It was learned that Li Lanbao was hidden at No. 12, Lane 120, Caishi Road in the French Concession. The detectives went there again and rescued her. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the three women, Li Zhu, etc., to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. First, the police station lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, explained the case and prosecuted the three defendants in accordance with Article 240 of the Criminal Law. According to Li Lanbao's testimony, in November of last year, she was deceived by Wang A'hai, a fellow villager, to come to Shanghai for fun and was sold to Li Zhu to work as a prostitute. According to the detective's report, the circumstances of the arrest of each defendant were explained, and a contract of sale of Li Lanbao found in Li Zhu's home was presented for inspection. Judge Qian Hongye then interrogated Li Zhu, who confessed that Li Lanbao voluntarily sold herself to me to work as a prostitute. At that time, she said that she had no husband. Chen Ding and Yang Liu both denied participating in the sale of Li Lanbao as a prostitute. Judge Qian obtained the confession and announced that the debate in this case was over and scheduled the verdict to be announced on Thursday morning of this week.

### Shanghai Telephone Bureau Expands Zero Switchboard

Another Hundred Pairs of Relay Lines Added; Wusong and Other Areas Gradually Improved

The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications previously had a sharp increase in urban users, and a special expansion of the zero switchboard and Wusong Pudong and other areas called the receiving machine will be planned to be converted into self-persuading machines. The details are recorded as follows:

Sharp Increase in Users: The city's urban telephone has been actively improved by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the areas of South Shanghai, Zhabei, and Longhua have been converted to automatic telephone machines. In recent years, telephone services have been exceptionally convenient. The number of shops, households, institutions, and groups, etc. that have installed telephones in each district has increased from more than 2,000 to nearly 5,000. The reason for the sharp increase in users is that after the central government implemented the legal tender policy, the financial market became active, so the total number of installations more than doubled. Moreover, the bureau continues to improve transportation tools.

Expansion of Switchboard: The Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company laid a hundred pairs of north-south city relay lines for the communication relay lines between the urban area and the special zone. The special zone dials "02" and the urban area dials "0" to call the receiver. Due to the sharp increase in telephone users in the urban area, the original "0" switchboard relay line is insufficient. Therefore, the bureau has specially planned to expand it. It is currently purchasing materials and will add another hundred pairs of relay lines. It will be laid as soon as the materials are ready.

Improvement of Each District: The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications recognizes the improvement of the city's telephone engineering, so telephone services have been exceptionally convenient in recent years. Now the bureau, in addition to converting the central area of Nanshi, Zhabei, Longhua and other areas to automatic machines, is now planning to gradually convert the calling machine of Wusong, Pudong, and Minhang and Zhuanqiao, etc. under the county to automatic machines, so that the city's telephone equipment is completely unified.

### Investigation into the Suicide of British Girl Thompson

Keeper Appears in Court to State Idle Talk; Haines Focuses on the Deceased's Honor

The English Shanghai Evening Post says that British girl Thompson, residing in Shanghai, was twenty-three years old. She was renowned throughout the city for her athletic skills and had won many championships, and was admired by thousands of people. On the 11th of this month, she committed suicide by drinking Lysol lotion. After unsuccessful treatment, she died. On Sunday afternoon, Coroner Haines of the British Consulate General's Police Court ruled that the lady had died from

Suicide, with Unclear Motives. During the hearing, Keeper, a fellow resident of the deceased and enamored with her, appeared in court to testify that two weeks before the deceased's suicide, he had discussed their marriage with her. He told her the reasons why he could not get married at the moment and decided to give up. The deceased also expressed her sympathy.

The Last Time he saw the deceased was at 10:30 PM on March 10. The deceased went to his room to chat, and there was no argument. However, during the conversation, he mentioned that he might as well move so that they could see each other less. The deceased refused, so he decided to stay. When the deceased left the room, her expression was as usual. Haines then declared that

There Was No Doubt that the deceased drank Lysol lotion at 7:30 PM on the night of March 11. It is also clear that the deceased especially loved Keeper. Perhaps she had been thinking about this that night and decided that it was not worth living in the world since she could not marry him. However, based on the witness's testimony, it is difficult to determine

What Kind of Thoughts she had at the Time of Death. Haines announced the adjournment of the court and then angrily stated a minute later that some of the unkind parts of society were making idle talk about the circumstances of the lady's death. However, because these malicious words were intended to harm the deceased's honor, it is now necessary to make a statement for the sake of justice, that is, that such slander has no medical evidence.

### Tan Bingguang Recovers His Lost Child

Younger Brother Found in Xingfa Hotel; Male and Female Abductors Vanished

Tan Bingguang, a Cantonese, lives at No. 61, Lane 281 (Tongrenli), Wuchang Road. He has a son named Xiaodidi, who is five years old. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, Xiaodidi suddenly disappeared. After searching everywhere, there was no news. Tan had no choice but to report the matter to the police station and request them to search for his whereabouts. However, because the clues were difficult to find, no clues were obtained. Unexpectedly, at about 11 PM the night before, the police station suddenly received an anonymous call, asking them to immediately go to the Xingfa Hotel at No. 374 North Zhejiang Road with the Huishi Police Station to escort and lead the child. At that time, the police station immediately ordered detectives to go, and there was indeed a child in Room No. 6. In addition, there was no one else. After investigation, according to the hotel clerk, the child was brought to the hotel at 10 PM on the 22nd by a man about twenty years old, claiming to be Zhang Er'a, accompanied by a woman about thirty years old. Not long after, the man and woman went out. The time from when the detectives rushed to the hotel to when the detectives arrived was only a few tens of minutes. Therefore, the detectives first searched the room and then picked up a piece of paper on the ground, which read "Tan Bingguang, No. 61, Tongrenli, Wuchang Road." The detectives determined that the Tan family did have a case of a missing child, so they immediately led the child to the Tan family's residence for confirmation. It was indeed Tan's younger brother, who had been missing for more than ten days. The family was overjoyed to be reunited. Afterwards, it was speculated that these abductors learned that the owner had reported to the police station, and it was difficult to leave the country, so they borrowed the hotel to send the original child back. The remaining police station, in view of the recent rampant abduction, did not cancel the case and continued to send detectives to search for the abductors in order to catch them and deter the abductors, and to maintain public security.

### Sun Shaoqing Accused of Barratry, with Three Additional Charges

㊀ Shi Dezhi's 40,000 Yuan ㊁ Lu Guanzeng's Over 60,000 Yuan ㊂ Jiang Yangshi's Property Division Case, Extorted 107,000 Yuan

—Pan Xueyan and Others Testified in Court Yesterday—

Sun Shaoqing was accused of barratry and extortion. Yesterday afternoon, the case was continued by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Special First Court. The lawyer of the police department, Ru Baoyi, stated that regarding the case of Wu Dengying being defrauded, which was previously prosecuted by the police department, the bank drafts paid had been verified by the police department regarding their numbers, amounts, and bank names. A detailed list would be submitted to the court. Xu Maochang, the main person defrauded in the Xu Maochang case, and Pan Xueyan had both appeared in court. The original contract for the Yao Zhichun case had also been obtained, with Sun also signing on it. Today, the police department filed three additional charges against Sun: ㊀ In December of the 22nd year, he extorted 40,000 yuan in silver from Shi Dezhi through intimidation. The reason was that Shi had suspended a coolie, and that coolie colluded with Sun Shaoqing, Wang Zhenchuan, Fan Liangbo, Wu Yunfu, and others in the name of the Jishan Hospital to accuse Shi in the District Court, claiming that Shi Dezhi's medicated water was imitating their Shidaoshi medicated water. They used various intimidating methods against Shi Dezhi and his attorney, Xu Shihao, to obtain 40,000 yuan.

During the period of their intimidation, Shi's son-in-law, Roberts, reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and the police station's records have been brought to the case. ㊁ In January of the 23rd year, he extorted 67,000 yuan from Lu Guanzeng through intimidation. Lu Guanzeng and his cousin Lu Zhushuang had already divided their property. Lu Zhushuang then hired Sun Shaoqing to litigate and use various threats, causing Lu Guanzeng to pay 67,000 yuan. Wang Zhenchuan and Jiang Zhaozhou were also mediators along with Sun. Today, Lu Guanzeng and his accountants Yu Shaoqiu and Pan Huan Cheng

have all appeared in court. ㊂ Sun Shaoqing had engaged in barratry in the case of Jiang Guopei and Jiang Yangshi dividing their property. The litigation in your court has already ended, but Sun used intimidation to make Jiang Yangshi pay 107,000 yuan. The police department filed lawsuits for the above three cases this morning. However, when Sun was arrested, documents regarding the engagement contracts of Wang Zikang, the accountant, and Ni Jiong, the lawyer, in the case of Ma Hongda in the Special Second Court were found in his home, so they will be prosecuted together next time, and Sun's wife, Sun Zhu, will also be prosecuted, etc. The court then ordered Sun to write the words

"Sun Shaoqing's Signature" in court and then asked if the words "Recommended by Sun Shaoqing" on the contract signed in the Yao Zhichun case were his signature, but Sun absolutely denied it. The court asked if the engagement contract of Wang Zikang, the accountant, was found in his home. He replied, "Yes," but denied that the lawsuit was something he had taken up through barratry. Judge Qian then summoned attorney Xu Shihao to court and handed him the record of the testimony taken by Judge Qian in the court office on the 3rd of this month regarding the Shi Dezhi case. After Xu read it,

he made some minor corrections and signed the record. Subsequently, Western Detective Ge Laobo testified that he had found that the 40,000 yuan paid by Shi Dezhi was handed to Sun Shaoqing in a garden in West Shanghai. Then Xu Maochang testified, proving that Sun Shaoqing had repeatedly come to my office to borrow money from me on behalf of Pan Xueyan. I then asked my friend Cai Futang to mediate, and the matter was settled with 19,000 yuan. Then Pan Xueyan testified that she initially knew nothing about the matter of demanding money from Xu Maochang.

On the day of signing, my mother told me that Mr. Xu was now willing to pay me a sum of money and instructed me to sign for it the day before yesterday. I signed to receive the money because I and Xu Pu were friends and had no relationship, so how could I accept this unclear sum of money? Therefore, I did not agree, but I went to sign under my mother's strong pressure. I went home as soon as I finished signing. I don't know anything about the content and the process, etc. Then Pan's mother, Cao Zhao, testified that it was Gu Hongsheng (i.e., Pan Hongsheng) who introduced and handled the negotiation with Xu, and the daughter didn't know anything, etc.

According to Lu Guanzeng, I and my uncle Lu Zhushuang had already separated our family a long time ago. Later, when my uncle was stationed in Japan as a consul, he had already exhausted his family property. When he was discharged and returned to China, he lacked travel expenses, so I borrowed money from him so that he could return to China. However, after returning to China, he borrowed 100,000 yuan from me, intending to create a Hua Central or Hua East Bank. After I found out that this was not the case, I did not lend it to him. Later, Lu Zhushuang sued me in the Shanghai District Court, saying that I had encroached on public property during the Guangxu 19th year, and also

listed Yu Shaoqing as a defendant. At that time, I hired attorney Cai Nipei to appear in court. Attorney Cai told me not to appear in court because I lived in Suzhou and was not under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District Court. Unexpectedly, after the court session, the judge ordered Yu to be released on bail and ordered me to hand myself over to the court within three days. Later, the reconciliation was handled by Yu Shaoqing and Pan Huan Cheng. I don't know the details. Then Yu and Pan proved that they negotiated a settlement with Sun Shaoqing and Jiang Zhaozhou and paid 67,000 yuan. The payment was also made at Sun's home, and Wang Zhenchuan was also present when the money was paid, etc. Judge Qian then questioned Sun based on the testimonies of the various witnesses, but Sun still absolutely denied it. The court reviewed the testimonies and announced that the case would be adjourned for further questioning.

### Yan Ziyu Sentenced in Central Refrigeration Plant Lawsuit

Using Fraudulent Means to Cause Others to Hand Over Property Yesterday, Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment

Yan Ziyu and Yu Wenhao, the owners of the Central Refrigeration Plant, mortgaged all of the plant's assets, equipment, and machinery to Xu Weizhou from Wuxi for 55,000 yuan in silver in March of the 24th year of the Republic of China. However, before the term expired, it was discovered that the plant had already been sold to the Bank of China and registered for business, disregarding the mortgaged portion. Xu then hired attorneys Xu Shihao and Zuo Dedao to accuse Yan and Yu of fraud in the First Special Court. Both defendants failed to appear after being summoned during the trial.

An order was issued for their arrest. Later, the police arrested Yan Ziyu and escorted him to the court. He was ordered to be released on bail for 30,000 yuan. Yu Wenhao was approved to be wanted. Now, the plaintiffs Xu Shihao and Zuo, the agents of Xu Weizhou, submitted a supplementary statement detailing the facts, stating that the plaintiff and the defendants were originally strangers. They met through an introduction by a friend, Zhu Lianfu. In February and March of the previous year, the defendant Yan Ziyu claimed to the plaintiff that the Central Refrigeration Plant was solely owned by him.

The capital was abundant. The annual import and export trade amounted to no less than one million yuan. Recently, due to the expansion of business, funds were needed to cope with it. It was proposed to mortgage the plant's machinery, equipment, and decorations to the plaintiff for 56,000 yuan in national currency. Because the plaintiff's personal finances were limited, he was unable to set up trade rights. Yan said that Yu Wenhao was wealthy and also willing to invest and jointly accept the mortgage. The plaintiff believed it to be true, so he invited close friends Bao Jianfu and Zhu Lianfu, and Yu Wenhao, to jointly organize a syndicate. Bao contributed 32,000 yuan, Zhu contributed 5,500 yuan,

The plaintiff contributed 5,500 yuan, and Yu 11,000 yuan, totaling 55,000 yuan. The plaintiff, under the name of Xu Weiji, established a mortgage right with Yan Ziyu. When the contract was signed, the plaintiff and Bao and Zhu recognized that the allocated shares had been fully collected, and they also asked Yu in person, who claimed that the 11,000 yuan he recognized had been delivered to Yan Ziyu, and Yan also admitted to having received it. The plaintiff then handed over the remaining 44,000 yuan to Yan, and both parties signed a mortgage contract, each holding it as proof. In fact, Yu was the capital of the Central Refrigeration Plant and accounted for shares of

Seven-tenths, and the allocated share of 11,000 yuan was not paid at all. He colluded with Yan to defraud, and they were partners in crime. It was found that the plant had already entered into a sales contract with the Bank of China before the plaintiff was mortgaged. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed, and incidental civil claims were attached, etc. This case has been clarified by Judge Ye Shengchao's interrogation. Yesterday afternoon,

The verdict was announced: Yan Ziyu, with the intent to illegally possess property, used fraudulent means to cause others to hand over property and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment. The defendant shall jointly compensate the plaintiff for 44,000 yuan, plus interest of 600 yuan per month from June 5th of the 24th year of the Republic of China until the date of execution.

### Brief Report on Maritime Communications

The Jianghai Customs received a radio message from the Taikoo Steamship Company's Chongqing Wheel on the afternoon of the 21st, stating that the ship, which had departed from Shanghai, was at 29 degrees 6 minutes north latitude and 122 degrees 25 minutes east longitude, which is near Ningbo's sea area, and found a large civilian ship drifting on the sea. There were no boatmen on the ship. It was presumed to be an accident. However, it seriously hinders the route. Upon receiving the report, Jianghai Customs notified various shipping companies the day before yesterday, telling the coastal transport ships to pay attention to avoid danger.

The Li Yuan Company's Changde Wheel had an accident near Sheshan. It has now been verified that it ran aground on hard sand, not a reef. However, the captain and crew did not wait for the rescue ship to arrive and all left the ship. They took the pilot boat to Shanghai. After the company and the insurance association jointly ordered all crew members and surveyor Xu Zufan to return to Xiaowei Mountain on a large tugboat to help rescue the ship. However, as of the afternoon before yesterday, Shanghai had not yet received a call from the rescue personnel. They were deeply worried. Therefore, the Ship Insurance Association hired another large tugboat, the "Kran Mengsmo Le", the night before to help with the rescue. In case the Changde Wheel was heavily loaded and had a shallow draft and there were no barges available for unloading, it was planned to discard some of the coal in the ship to reduce the hull and then tow and rescue it.

### Toyoda Workers Demolish Caojiadu Police Station and are Summoned for Questioning

Two of the Sixteen Defendants Did Not Arrive All Denied Involvement in the Demolition

Sun Qiantai, the chief representative of the workers of the Toyoda Textile Factory in West Shanghai, was stabbed and injured on the morning of the 19th of last month. Subsequently, the workers themselves captured the instigator, Shi Fulin. Because they petitioned the Caojiadu Branch to handle the matter, thousands of people gathered and demolished the branch, and injured the branch chief Tan Baoshou. The Municipal Police Department sent the leader of the Guard Team, Zhang Jinshan, to arrest 16 people, including Qu Hongfa, Wang Asan, Yu Haoda, Liu Chunqi, Qin Qiaosheng, Chen Chunsheng, Chen Chunguo, Zhou Lüchang, Hu Shouhou, Jiang Asi, Gan Songlin, Wu Jinsheng, Yang Yuantian, Zhang Wenyuan, and Yang Are, and transferred them to the District Court. The defendants requested

to stop the detention. After being granted bail, they were prosecuted for obstructing official duties and causing injury. Yesterday morning, Judge Bai Dongling opened the court. Two defendants, Qu Hongfa and Chen Chunsheng, did not arrive. According to Tan Baoshou, 42 years old, from Guangdong, at 6 a.m. on the 20th of last month, three or four thousand workers came to the bureau to make trouble. He tried to persuade them but they did not listen. They immediately started to destroy the branch, tore up the portrait of the president, and injured me, causing me to bleed. The Guard Team of the General Bureau arrived and surrounded them, etc. Zhang Jinshan said that he was 38 years old, from Hebei. After receiving news from the Caojiadu Branch, he was ordered

to bring a Guard Team of 40 people. At that time, the situation was very serious. After a demonstration, he first arrested nine people and then arrested seven more. The workers then dispersed, etc. On the defendant's side, ㊀ Wu Jinsheng said that he was 20 years old, from Yancheng, and a worker at the Toyoda Textile Factory. We went to petition, there were three or four thousand people, and we completely denied taking action to destroy or damage anything. ㊁ Zhou Lüchang said that he was 22 years old, a Toyoda worker. He went to work on the 20th of last month. They told me not to go to work because the workers' chief representative Sun Qiantai was stabbed and we went to petition, but I also

do not admit that I damaged the branch chief. ㊂ Jiang Asi said that he was 22 years old. I did not participate. I was arrested at the Workers' Welfare Association. ㊃ Yang Are said that he was 22 years old. I was late and was arrested before I even got to the branch. ㊄ Wang Asan said that he was 29 years old. I am a worker representative. Because the chief representative Sun Qiantai was stabbed, I reported it to the branch, but they didn't care. We arrested Shi Fulin ourselves and asked them to handle the matter, but they didn't release him and opened fire, injuring four of our male and female workers. When we were escaping, we crushed some of the bureau's items, and Tan Baoshou's injury was probably also caused by the crushing. ㊅

Yu Haoda said that he was 21 years old and completely denied the destruction. ㊆ Yang Yuantian said that he was from Taixing. I was arrested at the Welfare Association. I knew nothing about the destruction. ㊇ Chen Chunguo said that he was 23 years old, from Gaoyou. Qu Hongfa is the chairman of the Welfare Association and Sun Qiantai is the chief representative, but he claimed that he did not know anything about the destruction. ㊈ Gan Songlin said that he was 28 years old, a local. I went to the union to get a copper plate and was arrested. I don't know anything, etc. ㊉ Hu Shouhou said that he was 23 years old, from Dongtai.

I went to petition to arrest the traitor Shi Fulin because he injured our Sun Qiantai, but I also did not admit the destruction. ㊉㊀ Qin Qiaosheng said that he was a Toyoda worker and completely replied that he did not know anything about everything that happened. ㊉㊁ Liu Chunqi said that the worker representatives were Wang Asan, Zhang Asan, and Qu Hongfa. I heard someone say on the road that the chief representative Sun Qiantai had bought a traitor to injure him, and I

went to the association to inquire about those who were arrested. ㊉㊂ Zhang Asan said that he was 21 years old. I am a worker representative, I didn't go, etc. ㊉㊃ Zhang Wenyuan said that he was 20 years old, from Yancheng. Because the director mentioned Shi Fulin and was unwilling to release him, we went to petition. I also do not admit the destruction. The court decided to adjourn the trial because the defendants were not all present. Moreover, Shi Jinchun, the translator of the Toyoda Textile Factory, had important criminal suspects, so the District Court specially sent bailiff Zhou Qiwen to secretly wait for Shi to go out the day before yesterday and immediately arrest him, hire a car in advance, immediately escort him to the court, detain him, and investigate the matter.

### Junpu Bureau Leases Gaoqiao North Sand Fields

Limited to Agricultural Use

The Shanghai Junpu Bureau's Gaoqiao North Sand reclamation land had previously been leased to the Customs for use. It has now been recovered from today onwards. It is now scheduled to be leased in sections, limited to agricultural use. Each section is ten acres, and the annual rent is 30 yuan in national currency. Payment is required before planting. All current planting households can register with the bureau's administrator to lease it. However, the rent is calculated from January 1st of this year and must be paid in full.

### Two People Poisoned from Eating Pufferfish Roe

Pijiang Wu Yucheng, along with the famous Afu and Asi, and five others, rented a house at No. 8 Lianyi Lane, Jiucang Street, in the city. Yesterday morning, Afu brought back a bag of pufferfish roe from outside, cooked it, and invited Wu Yucheng and others to eat it together. Yucheng was afraid of dying and did not eat it. Only Afu and one unnamed person ate it together. They drank Liangshao wine and praised it as delicious. Unexpectedly, within half an hour of eating, they felt dizzy and their hands and feet were numb. The person who ate with him was the same. Yucheng knew he was poisoned and immediately hired two cars and sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment. After treatment, Afu died of poisoning at around 5:00 because he had eaten too much. The person who ate with him was also in critical condition. The hospital reported it to the Laozha Police Station and sent Detective Zhongyi to the Laobeidou Police Station to request that the police be sent to investigate and report to the hospital for inspection.

### Korean Rents Remaining House to Make Drugs and Detains Second Landlords for Investigation

Qian Lishi and others arrested According to drug prohibition regulations

Recently, the drug ban has been strict, and the spread of drugs is particularly widespread. Most of the sellers are Korean bridges in Shanghai. They rely on the judgment right as a talisman, so they have no scruples. The locations for selling drugs are mostly on the lower floors of stoves in the Public Concession, with Edward Road and Hubei Road being the most common. The second landlords only know how to profit. Whenever they see these people renting from them, they deliberately raise the rent and know

the rent is short. Pay three months' rent in advance. Drug dealers make profits by operating this business, so they don't mind the high rents. After renting it, they must redecorate the stove. All the original doors and windows are blocked, and a door is opened from a hidden place for access. They also open a square hole in the wall door. People who buy drugs only need to put the price in the hole to get the heroin, morphine, and other drugs they bought. If

the police detective knows about it and sends a detective to investigate, the original door has been blocked, and they must destroy it to enter the room. At this time, the drug dealers in the room will calmly put the drugs into the pre-set stove or hide them in a more secret place. Even if someone is caught with both the person and the stolen goods, the offender is Korean and is not subject to our country's laws. According to the treaty, the case is handed over to the Japanese Consulate. However, these drug dealers soon

resume their business. Therefore, the police authorities are now taking measures from the side, and specially warned the households that rent out the remaining houses. If they still rent the remaining houses to drug dealers to sell drugs privately, once it is verified, they will be reported according to law. There are still Qian Yuxing's lead shop owner Qian Lishi from Ningbo at 55 Hubei Road and Sen Da Brick and Ash Bank owner Chen Weiming at 66 Hubei Road.

Huge rents were paid to the Korean Kim Tae-sik and others to be used as drug trafficking agencies. In addition to searching and obtaining heroin at those two locations, totaling more than 1,300 packs, and Kim Tae-sik was handed over to the Japanese Consulate for minor punishment, Cao Qishan, a detective from the Laozha Police Station, and Chinese head Liu Yaying, Qian Lishi, and Chen Weiming were detained in the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi

prosecuted based on Article 5 and Article 9 of the Drug Prohibition Regulations and stated the facts of the case, requesting strict punishment to serve as a warning and to eliminate drug harm. After Qian, the Criminal Division Chief, conducted an inquiry, he ordered Qian Lishi to be detained pending sentencing next week and sentenced Chen Weiming to three years of imprisonment as a warning. In the future, I deeply hope that the general second landlords will take this as a warning and not be blinded by greed, and fuel the drug disaster.

### Xing Zhigang Again Asks For Suppression of Wharf Robbers

Xing Zhigang, the district chief of the fifth district of Shanghai County, has repeatedly requested the suppression of wharf robbers who disrupt navigation, but his request was not granted. Yesterday, he submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that the Municipal Police Department be ordered to set up fixed posts and be responsible for patrolling to quell the bandits. The area from Dongjiadu No. 18 Public Wharf in Waima Road to Xinmatou to the north, and the area from Cuifeng Wharf to Damatou, are busy areas for ship passengers. The gang knows when ships come and go, so they often hang around each alley near the wharf, waiting for passengers to carry their luggage and hire rickshaws. They then rush forward, surround the vehicles, and use the excuse of asking for travel expenses to search and rob them. The rickshaw pullers also collude with each other and take advantage of each other, treating it as a constant business. Moreover, the passengers who are robbed are in the harbor and are in a hurry to leave, so most of them are unwilling to report to the bureau, and there are no posts in that area, so the gangs gather more and more and take the opportunity to plunder without any scruples. The people in the district are more deeply victimized because they enter and exit the No. 18 Public Wharf and the South Pinghu Wharf. I have repeatedly written to the former Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Wharf Management Office of the Municipal Public Works Bureau to notify the Public Security Branch in charge to strictly arrest and investigate the matter, but the gang has great powers, and the detectives treat it as a formality and fail to enforce it. The various merchants in that area also witnessed this fact and were unable to remain silent. Therefore, I am specially pleading with your lord to examine and approve it, and quickly order the Municipal Police Department to strictly order its subordinates to set up fixed posts in the busy ports for passengers entering and exiting from No. 18 Public Wharf to Damatou, and to be responsible for patrolling and strictly searching and arresting them in order to combat bandits and protect navigation. I am extremely grateful.

### Jiangsu Bank Robbery Case Accuses Private Torture and Slander

The Detective Has Been Prosecuted, but Liu Bingyuan and Others Deny It

The detectives of the Detective Branch, Liu Bingyuan, Miao Mingzhong, and Wu Songyou, were accused by Ruan Defu, the owner of Ruan Wanxing Hardware Store at No. 119 Xinmin Road, Zhabei, Nanjing, through attorney Chen Mao Xuan, in the District Court Prosecutor's Office of detaining Gu Naide, falsely accusing him of being related to the Jiangsu Bank robbery case on Xinzha Road, and torturing him to force him to identify Ruan and Shi Dengnian and Ma Dengnian (i.e., Ma Dexiang) as accomplices. Shi and Ma were arrested, and they also went to Ruan's place. Ruan happened to be out, and they searched for a long time but found nothing and left. The next day, Miao Mingzhong went to the store and told Ruan's mother, Kong, that it would be over if she gave 150 yuan. After entrusting Fan Bingnan and others to say that it was necessary to have 100 yuan, but they were legitimate businessmen, so they did not agree. Shi and Ma were arrested and released without being transferred to the court. After Gu Naide was sent to the court, he was found to be innocent and not prosecuted. It is obvious that they framed others, used their positions to defraud money, and requested an investigation, etc. After Prosecutor Li Fen opened the court to investigate, he released the three detectives on bail and prosecuted them for obstructing freedom and fraud. Yesterday, Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court to hear the case. The defendants Liu Bingyuan, Miao Yizhong, and Wu Songshan, etc., stated that there was absolutely no extortion. The officer asked Liu if there was no solicitation, why were Shi Dengnian and Ma Dengnian released after they were arrested? He replied, this was because no suspicion was found, so they were released. The officer then summoned the three plaintiffs to the court, and they all testified that there was fraud and that three families were searched for no reason. Even Gu Naide was framed, and the charges had been dropped by your court. All their attempts to defraud can be proved by Fan Bingnan. Therefore, the officer summoned Fan Bingnan to the court to prove that the defendants instructed him to negotiate gold and silver with Ruan, etc. The court decided to adjourn the trial for further questioning. Because the defendants' circumstances were serious, the original bail was insufficient, so it was decided to add a store bail of 3,000 yuan. Because it was difficult to find a guarantor at the time, the defendants' defense lawyers requested that they be ordered to pay first and then find a guarantor. The officer ordered that one defendant be taken away by the lawyer and that the bail must be corrected within three days, otherwise it would be inconvenient.

### Appeal in Yan Pinzheng's Abortion Case Concluded

Sentencing Scheduled for the 27th

Yan Pinzheng, a female doctor at the Dasheng Obstetrics Hospital, and Gu Shaoqin, an intern, performed an abortion on Li Jingzhen, a local young woman, at No. 93 Yongyu Lane, Beller Road, on February 4 of this year, introduced by Xue Kebin. Due to surgical errors, the uterus was injured, and excessive bleeding occurred, resulting in Li's death the next morning. Her family reported it to the French police, and the three people, Yan, Gu, and Xue, were detained by the Second Special Court, and the police lawyer filed a public prosecution according to law. The victim's family also hired a lawyer to file an incidental complaint, seeking compensation for losses of more than 10,000 yuan in gold and a diamond ring. As a result of the trial, Yan Pinzheng was sentenced to three years and two months in prison and fined 100 yuan. Gu Shaoqin was sentenced to 10 months in prison, and Xue Kebin was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison. Because the three people, Yan, etc., did not accept the judgment, they hired lawyers such as Wang Shizong, Ge Zhiqin, and Sun Zushen to appeal to the High Third Branch. After one court hearing, they were ordered to wait for the summoning of witnesses for a retrial, which has been recorded in this newspaper. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the High Third Branch Court, headed by Wu Tingqi, along with the two judges Wang and Fan, and Prosecutor Dong, opened the court for continued questioning. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi appeared in court. The appellants denied performing an abortion on the deceased, claiming that she had an abortion elsewhere and came to retrieve the placenta. Gu Shaoqin denied helping with the abortion, and Xue Kebin, who introduced the deceased, only admitted to introducing the deceased to retrieve the placenta at Dasheng Hospital and denied introducing her for an abortion. According to witness Hu Chen, the second landlord of the small house where the deceased lived, Xue Kebin came to introduce the deceased for an abortion and accompanied her to Dasheng Hospital. She saw the two defendants wearing white clothes and performing the abortion on the deceased. According to witness Xia Chen, Hu Chen's sister, she visited the deceased at Dasheng Hospital that night. The court believed that the case was clear and ordered the opening of the debate, then declared the conclusion. The sentencing was scheduled for the 27th, and the appellants were still detained pending instructions.

### Modern Politics and China (Continued)

— Junshan

Third, more experience. The cabinet of party politics is: you are responsible for a few days, and then I am responsible for a few days. Such mutual growth and infighting will increase experience, but the real political experience will suffer great damage. For example, the French cabinet lasts no more than ten months at most, and usually collapses in only two or three months. It is of course impossible to expect it to be planned and experienced in this way.

Fourth, technical refinement. Political technology is the same as other technologies. If you are responsible for one day today and collapse tomorrow, you will naturally not get excellent technology. Everyone knows that it is faster to drive a light car on a familiar road. Familiarity breeds skill is also a established theory. Therefore, to require technical refinement, you must be responsible for more time, not ascend the stage today and step down tomorrow.

Fifth, speed up the time. Multi-party politics is mutual restraint, mutual meetings, mutual discussions, wasting time, and stopping things that should be done. In this way, all undertakings of the country will suffer great harm, especially military affairs will suffer great failures. This situation has been seen in various countries, so in order to improve efficiency, they have shifted from emphasizing the rule of law to emphasizing the rule of people.

Finally, let's talk about removing the drawbacks of restraint. All comrades understand that politics relies on the promotion of power, and of course they also know that multi-party politics is the dispersion of power. This group and that group do not conspire with each other. Is this the dispersion of power? Is it applicable in this world of struggle?

Secondly, the neutralization of power. Under the politics of separation of powers, you do that way, I do this way, power is wasted, and politics does not move forward, and power restraint occurs, because when you use your power, I still want to hinder you, and when I use my power, you come to hinder me again. Isn't party politics the dispersion of power, the neutralization of power, and the restraint of power? At any time and any place, there is infighting, trying to eliminate other people's power and increase their own power. As a result, a few people compete for status, but the future of the country and the nation is buried. Various countries have seen this problem, so they want to correct it, which is why today's trends have emerged, resulting in today's political form and substance.

These five points are the important reasons for today's political evolution. Understanding these five points, we can know that the evolution of politics is an inevitability of the urgent preparation and emergency measures required by the intensity of the struggle. (To be continued)

### Cao Shuming's Speech on the National Defense of the Soviet Union (Continued)

㊀ All Soviet military supplies, such as guns, cannons, bullets, tanks, bombers, destroyers, submarines, torpedo boats, etc., are self-made and self-sufficient, and none of them are foreign goods. During the first five-year plan, this supply only paid considerable attention and achieved results in terms of quantity. Now, it has further strived for excellence in terms of quality and has achieved great success.

㊁ Because military equipment, as large as guns, cannons, tanks, and warplanes, and as small as explosives and screws, all have their importance and secrecy. If these things are all bought from foreign countries, you may not be able to buy the most refined and the newest. At the same time, the selling country or several countries can know your national defense strength and know your national defense secrets. To put it mildly, you cannot defend the country that sells you military supplies. The Soviet authorities know the importance of this point, so they manufacture and supply themselves, on the one hand, to maintain the secrecy of military strength, and on the other hand, not to be restrained by any foreign country. At the same time, because of the development of heavy industry, a large number of specialized technical talents have been cultivated in practice, and most of the labor problems have been solved. This point has more real significance in national defense. Please pay special attention to it.

㊂ The Soviet authorities know the close relationship between transportation and military affairs. For transportation, they add railways or highways where railways have not been built, or add double tracks or parallel highways where railways have already been built. They are also extending existing canals or building new canals to connect water transportation. As for the extension and development of civil aviation routes, they are making every effort to develop them. The Soviet Union's construction of transportation is simply progressing by leaps and bounds. You must know that from a military point of view, the development of transportation is convenient for mobilization and transportation, which is of great significance in national defense. In short, the Soviet Union's military defenses have considerable strength as of now, and they are continuing to move forward. On the one hand, the Soviet authorities are shouting the slogan of defending peace with peace and force on the international stage, because peace is not an empty promise, but must be prepared with strength. Only with sufficient strength can we talk about peace with strength, and only then can peace be realized. This is precisely the subtle effect of the Soviet Union's simultaneous efforts to strengthen its military and sing loudly for peace. Second, politics. The politics of the Soviet Union has great significance in national defense. We all know that the Soviet Union is founded on communism. Now, in the Soviet Union, in politics, only the Communist Party under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin controls the political power. (To be continued)

### The Chinese Basketball Team Will Go to Beijing for the Second Time to Fight Amateurs

Date Around the Beginning of Next Month

The Chinese basketball team visited the capital and returned to Shanghai the night before last. This trip made great contributions to the two battles with the military academy.

### Shanghai Jiaotong Sports Federation Holds a Members' Representative Congress

Wu Shaoshu from the Ministry of Transportation Attends the Meeting to Guide

The Shanghai Sports Federation of Various Agencies of the Ministry of Transportation recently held a general meeting of members' representatives at the YMCA. More than 20 representatives from the Ministry of Transportation Minister Yu, Director Wu Shaoshu, and various agencies attended. Kang Yong was elected as the chairman of the conference, and the ceremony was held. The chairman reported on the establishment of the association and explained the mission of the association. Then, Xu Duo, the representative of the board of directors, and Gu Youwu, the representative of the board of supervisors, reported on the work situation in the past year. Then, Representative Wu delivered a speech, briefly saying that our country has valued literature and belittled martial arts for thousands of years, creating a state of anti-sports movement in politics, economy, and society, resulting in the decline of the national physique to this day, which is far inferior to other countries. In recent years, society has responded to the country's declining fortunes, and the government's efforts to promote sports have gradually attracted people's attention. However, the development of sports is still far behind other countries. Therefore, the organization of the Shanghai Sports Federation of Various Agencies has not only the mission of promoting the development of sports, but also the responsibility of contributing to the country and society. Then, the articles of association were revised and proposals were discussed, all of which were passed and handed over to the next board of directors for handling. An election was held on the spot, and as a result, Chen Xuliang, Xu Duo, Kang Yong, Yao Yiming, Wu Zhifu, Gu Ermei, and Jiang Kun were elected as directors, and Huang Shouxiang, Wang Chengming, Lin Puxian, Gu Youming, and Qi Zaizhi were elected as supervisors.

### The Social Affairs Bureau Orders All Middle Schools in the City to Submit Six Key Points of Student Status

▲ A Circular is Issued to Strictly Enforce It to Rectify

The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau yesterday issued an order to all municipal and private middle schools in the city, saying that the measures for middle schools in the city to report student status were issued by the former Municipal Education Bureau in the instruction No. 6231 of the Education Department in March of the thirty-second year, and have been followed since then for a long time. Recently, it has been found that a small number of schools have not strictly followed the regulations. The following points that should be paid attention to are listed below: ㊀ Each semester, the enrollment of new students and transfer students should be reported together with the certificates and completed forms for the record within one month after the start of the semester. No delays are allowed. If the deadline is exceeded, the review will not be conducted. ㊁ If the admission certificates of new students and transfer students in each term are allowed to be submitted later, or should be inquired from the original school's competent authority, they should be recovered and submitted, or sent for inquiry within the semester, and handled separately. Do not neglect and delay. After the deadline, those who have not completed the procedures for confirming student status will not be recognized for their transfer or promotion qualifications, or will not be allowed to participate in graduation exams and joint exams. ㊂ Transfer students from other schools must have certificates that are connected to the semester before they can be admitted. Once it is found that they are skipping grades, their student status will not be recognized. ㊃ When recruiting students with equivalent academic ability, they should be carefully screened during the entrance examination, and those with truly equivalent academic ability should be selected and admitted according to the ratio stipulated in the regulations, and the examination papers should be submitted for review. ㊄ All students transferred from unregistered schools, regardless of their past grades, are only allowed to be admitted to the first grade with equivalent academic ability. ㊅ The school should first review the admission certificates of students, and separately order the submission of formal graduation certificates or transfer certificates for verification. Do not use informal proof documents to perfunctorily deal with the matter. The foregoing items are extremely important to the progress of teaching, academic studies, and academic advancement. Since the issuance of this circular, it shall be strictly enforced to rectify the situation. This order is hereby issued to all schools to strictly follow the procedures.

### The City Public Education Center Held an Opening Ceremony for the United National Salvation Movement Yesterday

More than Three Thousand Citizens Participated in an Unprecedented Grand Occasion; Director Pan Unveiled the Ceremony, and Dr. Liu Zhanen Delivered a Speech

The Shanghai Municipal Public Education Center's United National Salvation Propaganda Movement opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The surrounding environment was freshly decorated, and the citizens who participated were extremely enthusiastic, numbering more than three thousand. After the chairman, Curator Xu Zexiang, led the ceremony, Director Pan of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs unveiled the ceremony. The details are as follows:

The Director Unveils the Ceremony - The bell rang ten times, and Director Pan unveiled the ceremony and delivered a speech. He stated that to complete the genuine United National Salvation work, the entire nation must be of one mind, united and as solid as an iron bucket. Only then can we talk about resisting the enemy, defending against insults, saving the country, and striving for survival. Last year's Liangguang Incident and the Xi'an Incident were both peacefully resolved without firing a single shot under the authority and virtue of the Central Government. All this symbolizes that our country already has a supreme leader and our government already has a solid foundation. Finally, he hoped that the people of the whole country would unanimously support the government and strive for United National Salvation under the leadership of our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to complete the mission of national rejuvenation.

Liu Zhanen's Speech - Next, Dr. Liu Zhanen delivered a speech. His first point was that to achieve true national unity, it is necessary to have not only political unity, military command unity, and financial unity, but also, and more importantly, spiritual unity. How to implement spiritual unity? The prerequisite is to start with civic training, and he proposed five specific goals for civic training. His second point was to hope that the people of the whole country would unite as one, emulate countries like Russia, Germany, and Italy, and organize the entire population, regardless of scholars, farmers, workers, or merchants, regardless of men, women, old, or young, into a national mobilization. Start with public training in every family, and then extend the strength of 450 million people to strive to save the country.

A Message to the Citizens - Elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow citizens of the city, the call for United National Salvation has arrived with the 26th year of the Republic. Look, who among the vast majority of citizens of the Republic of China, except for the "remnants of feudal warlords," the "communist bandits," and the so-called "people's front" or "united front," except for the "traitors" who act as puppets for the enemy, such as Pu Yi and Yin Rugeng, do not express joyful and encouraging support for the slogan of United National Salvation? Yes, United National Salvation is what everyone eagerly hopes for, it is what China urgently needs, it is what everyone has in mind. However, we must not treat this as an empty slogan, just shouting it out. We must permanently imprint it in our hearts, we must earnestly believe in it and practice it, we must bravely and resolutely promote its realization. We must also believe that this is a movement to which the life of our nation is entrusted. We must know that only through unity can we save the country, and only by earnestly uniting to save the country can our nation survive safely. In order to ensure that everyone never forgets and earnestly practices this, our center is holding this United National Salvation Movement propaganda week. As for why we need to unite to save the country and how to achieve United National Salvation, I would like to briefly offer my views to the fellow citizens of the city. ㊀ Why Unite to Save the Country? The facts of the current historical stage tell us that the crisis of 1936 was barely overcome. 1927 was not a peaceful year. I am afraid no one can deny this fact. All the imperialists are sharpening their swords and expanding their armies, preparing for the second large-scale massacre of weak nations. In particular, our powerful neighbor is constantly attacking us with both overt and covert schemes. In this environment, we must know that only by resisting insults and defending against enemies and by diligently preparing to cope with the current Second World War can we preserve the survival of our nation and the lives of our people. This is undoubtedly and is the only mission of every citizen of the Chinese nation at present. To resist the enemy and defend against insults, to cope with the arrival of extraordinary times, the prerequisite is to first achieve the true unity of national military command and government orders. Only then can the government further plan for the construction of the national economy and the completion of transportation. With the unity of military command and government orders, and the completion of economic and transportation construction, then, with sufficient national strength, we can talk about resisting insults and defending against enemies, saving the country, and striving for survival. Therefore, our only way to save the country at present is the "Unity Movement." ㊁ How to Achieve United National Salvation? Without unity, we cannot "save the country." If we want to "save the country," we must first "unite." This is the fact before our eyes. However, how to achieve United National Salvation? We now offer three points, hoping that all citizens of the city will practice them together under this common goal to complete the great cause of United National Salvation and embark on the path of national rejuvenation. First, Firmly Believe: The Three Principles of the People proclaimed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang, are not only the only doctrine to save China but also the doctrine to save the world. Therefore, we should all recognize the Three Principles of the People, jointly believe in the Three Principles of the People, and realize a new China based on the Three Principles of the People as the only object of our efforts to unite to save the country. We must use the Three Principles of the People to exclude other doctrines, and we must use the Three Principles of the People to explain all phenomena. Only in this way can we have the same common belief. Only with the same common belief can our thoughts be unified, and only then can we work together under the same goal to complete the great cause of saving the country. What are the people's front and the united front? Those are all the communist bandits' deceiving ghost stories that are at their wits' end, inciting the people to undermine unity and leading the country and the nation to destruction. Second, Support the Leader: Chinese and foreign history both tell us that the prosperity of a nation is invariably based on the masses obeying the national leader, and only with consistent action can they establish great achievements. This was the case in ancient times, and it is the same now. Look, Germany has Hitler, and Italy has Mussolini. The people unanimously support them, so they can dominate Europe. After the last Xi'an Incident, we saw the psychology of the whole country, from the government to the people, unanimously supporting the leader, which proves that our country now has a supreme leader and that the life of the country and the nation is entrusted to him. From now on, we should sincerely support this supreme leader—Chairman Chiang Kai-shek—and dedicate all our strength to the country so that our supreme leader can use the strength of the people of the whole country to complete the great cause of resisting insults and defending against enemies and rejuvenating the nation. Third, Improve Our Lives: We know that the people's lifestyles play an important role in the rejuvenation of a nation. If you look at a strong country, its national life is bound to be full of vigor. Looking back at the people of our country, in the past, most of them were listless, either poor and ignorant or romantic and extravagant. With such a national spirit, how can we shoulder the great cause of saving the country? Therefore, in order to be able to shoulder the responsibility of resisting insults and defending against enemies and rejuvenating the nation, the improvement of our lives is an urgent task. The key to improving our lives is that the whole country, from top to bottom, should consistently implement the New Life Movement and strive for economic construction so that we have a full spirit in our minds and abundant supplies in materials. This improvement in spiritual and material life is the practical way to strengthen national power. Under the leadership of a supreme leader, we can shoulder the mission of saving the country and striving for survival and national rejuvenation. Finally, our center would like to hope with all sincerity that the fellow citizens of the city will recognize the current state of the country, stand united under the banner of United National Salvation, and actively strive for the United National Salvation Movement, acting as the vanguard of the nation. We also believe with all sincerity that as long as the Unity Movement is completed, the work of saving the country will surely be completed.

Many long positions in No. 4 were cut. No. 5, No. 10, and No. 45 were all sold. In the morning, the market opened, and the long positions immediately emerged. The market price fell back by 3, 5 dimes to 1 yuan or more. However, those who went long bought again, and because this month was the last day, the previous Class E and Class D were slightly smaller by 4, 5 dimes, but the latter were still pulled up by half a yuan to 1 yuan or more. However, most of the sellers had real goods, so the market could not be maintained. In the afternoon, the market was quite mixed, with highs and lows ranging from 1 dime to 6 dimes. Large holders sold off, and the market clearly declined, with all prices falling back by 2 dimes to 6 and a half dimes. As a result, the market price fell by 5 cents to 1 dime to 1 yuan and 1 dime. Today, only the April futures for one month were traded. The total transaction volume was 20,265,000 yuan. The results of the price changes are listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

### Yarn and Cotton Yarn Sales Declining, Standard Yarn Rising and Falling Immediately

Many Long Positions Emerged at High Prices - 24,000 Bales Delivered This Month

The yarn market has rebounded and the trend is calm. The current yarn sales market is smaller than before. The Tianjin gang has been buying heavily for days, and their appetite seems to be full. It is expected that they will stop temporarily. At the same time, many long positions have suddenly emerged in the near term, causing the chips to loosen, and the market has turned downward. However, the overseas cotton industry is still rising. Today is the last day for this month's yarn, and the delivery volume is expected to be between 22,000 bales and 24,000 bales.

This Month's Rolling Price Fell by 1 Yuan and 5 Dimes - The Spot Yarn Market Opened in the Morning, and Each Month Continued to Rise - Because US Cotton Did Rise as Expected. However, When the Second Round Opened, a Falling Trend Suddenly Started. The Three-Quality Yarn Was Flat, and Many Long Positions Emerged at the Time of Rising Prices. Therefore, The Trading Floor Was Loose and Disorderly, The Market Sentiment Became More Frustrated, and The Prices Dropped Round by Round. However, The Current Yarn Transactions Were Still Maintainable. As a Result, The Price of Each Month's Standard Yarn Fell by Six, Seven, Eight Dimes to One Yuan and Four Dimes Compared to the Previous Day's Closing Price. In the Afternoon, When The Market Opened, The Market Situation Was Still Hesitant and Weak, Because Long Positions Were Unloading In The Near Term. Current Yarn Transactions Were Not As Strong As The Previous Day. The Morale Became More And More Weary. There Was No Significant Entrance Or Exit In The Fourth Round. As A Result, The Price Of Each Month Rose Or Fell By One Dime Compared To The Morning Closing Price. It Was Found That 1,800 Bales Of Heshung Were Sold, 2,500 Bales Of Hengyi, 1,100 Bales Of Jinchang, 3,500 Bales Of Gengfeng, 850 Bales Of Fengtai, 850 Bales Of Dachangcheng, 6,200 Bales Of Changfeng, 2,650 Bales Of Runkang, 900 Bales Of Hengchang, 800 Bales Of Shengyuan, And 2,050 Bales Of Dachang. 1,100 Bales Of Yichang Were Bought, 2,500 Bales Of Wang Taixing, 900 Bales Of Dafeng, 1,200 Bales Of Daji, 4,550 Bales Of Mingde, 1,250 Bales Of Ruida, 1,150 Bales Of Shenda, 1,300 Bales Of Renfeng, 2,150 Bales Of Xiesheng, 1,100 Bales Of Fukang, 1,900 Bales Of Yongda, 2,800 Bales Of Xincheng, And 900 Bales Of Shenji. The High And Low Prices During The Day Are Listed On The Left.

Only 1,400 Bales Were Sold Currently - The Current Yarn Sales Were Slightly Clear. It Was Found That The Total Statistics Of Each Gang Buying Were 1,439 Bales. The Sales Price Was Similar To The Previous Day. The Purchase Amount Of Each Gang Is Listed Below.

### Raw Cotton Futures Overwhelmed by Coarse Cotton

—Following the Decline in the Yarn Market—

The cotton market has turned sluggish because the current month's trading period has only today left. There is a lack of demand for coarse cotton raw materials, but the trading of fine cotton remains decent. Therefore, exchange commodities are less welcomed, and the pressure is still heavy. Some say that the price increase of US cotton spot goods yesterday was too weak, and there may be a decline today.

Yesterday, it had already fallen by thirty or forty points. In the opening of the cotton market this morning, the current month slightly rose by five points. However, when auctioned to the forward period, it turned to decline, and the situation was very weak. Although US cotton rose, its upward momentum was not strong. In addition, the Japan-India trade agreement has been finalized, and Indian cotton itself has prospects for prosperity. Moreover, Chinese cotton exports have suffered a major blow. Therefore, a certain merchant heavily shorted the market yesterday afternoon. For a while, most of those who echoed this sentiment were pessimistic. Moreover, the delivery volume for this month is excessive, so the market price turned to decline. As a result, prices for all months were down by two and a half to three corners compared to yesterday's closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, the situation was calm, and there was no significant trading activity in the market. The fluctuations were also slight, and it presented a stalemate. As a result, prices for all months were down by another five points to one corner compared to the morning's closing price. It is found that 21,600 bales were sold by Hengyi, 2,600 bales by Tongfu, 1,700 bales by Jifeng, 3,400 bales by Yuda, 3,200 bales by Dafeng, 2,600 bales by Daji, 7,300 bales by Mingde, 2,900 bales by Hexing, 7,900 bales by Gengfeng, 7,100 bales by Dachang, 5,100 bales by Shengyuan, 13,700 bales by Changhe, 5,000 bales by Changfenghu, and 3,000 bales by Jinghua. 2,800 bales were purchased by Yikang, 3,600 bales by Juxing, 2,100 bales by Yuanda, 2,600 bales by Zhenda, 6,400 bales by Fengtai, 2,800 bales by Wangtaixing, 10,300 bales by Maichang, 9,400 bales by Yichang, 4,800 bales by Changfeng, 5,100 bales by Xiecheng, 3,200 bales by Yuanxingchang, 1,200 bales by Xinchang, 1,900 bales by Yongda, 1,900 bales by Xincheng, 2,008 bales by Runkang, and 1,900 bales by Shenji. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

Fine Cotton Sales Still Smooth. Current cotton consumption is still good, and the sales of fine cotton are still smooth, it is said.

### Japan-India Trade Agreement Successful, World Cotton Market Rises Universally

The US cotton market opened yesterday with strong upward momentum. Prices for all months rose by 21 to 29 points. In the early morning, there was strong foreign telegraphic communication. Foreign merchants, especially those in Liverpool, and Wall Street traders actively purchased, and the market situation was very strong. Then, a small number of short sales, the sluggishness of the grain and stock markets, and profit-taking by bulls led to a pullback. The large-scale profit-taking of bulls last week was enough to enhance the actual position, and the actions of foreign markets were also enough to restore buyers' confidence. At the same time, the rumors of inflation and the brisk consumption swept away the concerns about the increase in cotton fields. The closing was flat and tired. The spot price rose by 11 points, and the futures price rose by 11 to 24 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 16 points, and futures prices rose by 19 to 21 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to short covering, but then pulled back due to the sluggish stock market. Finally, it rose again due to the success of the Japan-India trade agreement and good telegraphic communication from Liverpool. The price of Pinggor rose by 6.75 to 7.5 rupees, the price of Omra rose by 7.25 to 8 rupees, and the price of White Row Creek rose by 7.25 to 7.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 22nd).

According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 23rd was: White Row Creek at 347 rupees, down 1 rupee; Omra at 235.75 rupees, down 1.75 rupees; Pinggor at 198.25 rupees, down 1.25 rupees.

According to another Bombay telegram on the same day, 246 tons of cotton were exported from Rangoon last week, all of which were shipped to Liverpool.

### Three Brands of Yarn and Cotton Fall Back, Only Spot Yarn Rises

Osaka telegram dated the 23rd: spot yarn rose by 5 to 10 yuan, 16-count fan-shaped yarn at 250 yuan, up 5 yuan; 20-count goldfish yarn at 272 yuan, up 7 yuan; 40-count five-metal yarn at 410 yuan, up 10 yuan; 42-count pheasant yarn at 395 yuan, up 5 yuan. Three brands of yarn futures fell by 1.60 to 3.30 yuan, with the near month at 264.60 yuan and the distant month at 262.70 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.10 to 0.60 yuan, with the near month at 79.90 yuan and the distant month at 82.05 yuan.

### Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou Yarn, Cotton, and Piece Goods Fluctuate Slightly

▲Qingdao A Qingdao telegram from the Allied News Agency on the 23rd: In the morning session of the Qingdao Exchange, Songlu brand yarn rose by 0.35 to 2.375 yuan, and standard cloth rose by 0.00325 yuan. In the afternoon session, standard yarn fell by 0.875 to 1.5 yuan, and standard cloth fell by 0.0025 yuan. The original telegram is recorded below.

Also, spot yarn fell by 2 yuan, and spot cloth rose by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan. The original telegram is recorded below.

▲Tianjin Spot yarn in Tianjin rose by 1 to 2 yuan, spot cloth rose by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan, and spot cotton rose by 0.5 yuan or fell by 1 yuan. The original telegram is recorded below.

### Silk and Tea Russians Like to Drink Ho Tea

What is to become of Chinese tea!

Russia purchases a large amount of tea from Ceylon. For half a year, no less than seven or eight thousand boxes have been transshipped through Shanghai. More than 2,060 boxes of tea were imported on the Zinijinaka round the other day. It is said that Russian ships will be waiting to transship to Vladivostok within days.

### Overseas Silk Prices Rise, Local Factories Wait and See

Yesterday, the overseas silk markets in Japan and the United States were both strong. Prices for both near and distant goods rose again. Yokohama spot prices rose by 10 yuan, and futures prices rose by 4 yuan. New York near-term prices rose by 4.5 cents compared to last Saturday, and futures prices rose by 2.5 cents. Japanese silk at 83 degrees rose by 2 cents, and silk at 75 degrees rose by 1 cent. The prices of other Chinese silks and Lyons silks remained unchanged. The Shanghai silk market currently has little trading because the mentality of the manufacturers is high and the fluctuations in overseas silk prices are erratic. Yesterday, Mitsui only sold some new silk. The price of white silk from this factory returned to 78 points, 770 yuan, which was not much different from the previous market. There were also only a few transactions in Indian silk, and the prices were as before.

### Grains Spot Wheat Arrivals Uninterrupted, Near-Term Bulls Will Abandon Delivery

Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw a unanimous price increase in overseas markets, and speculators gathered, so the market was booming when it opened in the morning, with near and far months all rising by four or five points. Afterwards, the weather turned sunny, the flour market gradually loosened, and the supply of spot goods was quite connected. The mentality of taking delivery in the near term gradually weakened, so the March and April contracts fell back by four or five points. However, the outlook for new wheat is still unclear. Speculators are hesitant, not as resolute as in the near term, so there were ups and downs in the afternoon, and the momentum turned calm. Compared with the previous day, this month was up by one point, April was unchanged, and June, July, and August were up by seven points to two points respectively. Spot wheat arrivals are continuous, and the market is flat. Only Shen Da took about 2,000 bags. Zhang Bailing wheat opened at 6.23 yuan, and Guantian Tiantai wheat opened at 6.20 yuan to 6.19 yuan. Other factories lack speculative interest, it is said.

### Delivery Power Sufficient, Near-Term Flour Falls, New Flour Rises

When the flour market opened yesterday morning, foreign wheat quotations were reported, with Chicago up by 0.37 to 0.57 yuan, Canada up by 0.40 to 0.50 yuan, and Liverpool up by 3 pence 625. Also, the weather was overcast and rainy, and people generally attributed this to the development of wheat fields, so the long positions in the forward months were quite excited, with July and August jumping up by two or three cents. However, the end of this month is approaching, the power of delivery is sufficient, and the outside bulls have to give up, so the opening fell by a fraction. However, the near-term and far-term mentalities were opposite, and the ups and downs restrained each other, so the rise and fall were not yet fierce. As the weather turned sunny in the afternoon, and the outgoing of this month continued unabated, especially the April contract was too far away from this month, which caused insider speculation, leading to a strong decline in April. The far-term also weakened, and the whole day's result was that this month fell by 0.0275 yuan, April fell by 0.0125 yuan, and July and August rose by about 0.01 yuan. Compared with the previous day, the situation was that the near term was weak and the far term was strong, it is said.

### Rice Market Situation is Flat for Local and Visiting Merchants

(South Shanghai) The supply of rice from various gangs yesterday was slightly less than before, with a total of nearly 50 numbers arriving, totaling 11,100 to 11,200 piculs. Among them, more than 20 numbers were thin rice. The market situation was sluggish. Yesterday, the rain made people's mentality firm, but although the sales in Ben Street were slightly moving, they were still not smooth, and the appetite for thin rice was very light. As for speculative appetite, it was weaker than before. The North and South Ocean gangs handled nearly 2,000 bags in total, so although the thin rice market had no ups and downs, the situation was very mediocre. Kujing rice slightly returned a few points because the price had already fallen through. Early rice was only flat, and Duyangjian and Yinwu were also unchanged.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday morning, the weather was suddenly overcast and rainy. There were 15 or 16 numbers of sources from He Xia, and the number of buyers and sellers on the market was sparse, resulting in flat trading of various goods. The price situation was not much up and down compared with the previous market. However, Yinbianwu goods were scarce and sales were active, and the price situation was firm. The price situation of other goods was unchanged.

(Visiting Merchants' Rice) Arrivals were many and sales were small, and the market was even weaker. It seemed that the Guangdong gang had no hope of continuing to speculate. The Shantou and Xiamen and Northwest gangs had been lacking in smooth sales for a long time. The total turnover of the market was less than 3,000 bags. Apart from a small amount of Jiyuan rice handled by the Beiyang gang, it was all for the sake of local entertainment. Ben Street lacked the intention to enter because the inventory in He Xia was sufficient. Therefore, the market situation almost had a slump. The total sales of Jiangxi machine brown rice were more than 2,400 bags, and the price was slightly lower than the previous market, it is said.

### Standard Oil, Near Month Down, Far Month Up

—Near-Term Cake Recovers by 0.0025 Yuan—

Yesterday, the standard oil and bean cake market lacked significant fluctuations. The fluctuations in the Dalian telegram were also slight. Both buyers and sellers lacked competition. In the near term for standard oil, there were bulls taking profits, and in the distant month, there was still speculation and absorption, so the closing price for this month fell by 0.25 yuan, and the distant month rose by 0.1 yuan and 0.05 yuan instead. The current soy market was weak, but the merchants also lacked dumping, so the market recovered by 0.01 and 0.02 yuan. The import and export of standard cake were balanced, and there was little attention to speculation and dumping. However, the spot goods moved slightly, and the near term recovered by 0.0025 yuan, and the distant term fell by 0.0025 yuan, it is said.

### Sugar Market Quanzhou Sliced Green Opening Price Stable

The sugar market was calm yesterday. The association allocated the market, and there were no changes in the number of 24 coarse sand white spot goods and transshipment goods 489, Dongbai, etc. There were also no ups and downs in the local factory's cotton white Zhenji, Dahua, and Jinxin, etc. Although the price of domestic Chaoqing production was sluggish, only one-tenth or two-tenths of those directly entrusted by the trade to the Chao gang could be purchased. The rest could not be purchased in full because most of the cargo owners were still waiting and seeing and were unwilling to sell cheaply. A few dozen bags of Quanzhou sliced green continued to arrive on the Huaping round the other day, and samples were seen yesterday. The opening price was immediately quoted at 11.80 to 11.60 yuan, which was absolutely unchanged from before. At a time when Chaoqing and Chih were falling frequently, sliced green was able to stabilize, which was really due to the scarcity of goods and active sales. Xinghua Gaojing was also 14.40 yuan, and dozens of bags were traded.

### North-South Goods Hankou Fungus Rises Again by More Than One Yuan

Hankou high-grade fungus has continued to rise since it rose to 120 yuan in the previous market. According to Hankou News, it has now reached 111.60 yuan, rising by more than one yuan. The trade price here for small airmail packages of fungus is 140 yuan, and the price for high-grade fungus is 170 yuan.

### Piece Goods Fine Twill is Uniquely Popular Due to Shortage

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market turned flat due to the decline in raw cotton futures. The Japanese trading houses also offered very few. The sales of fine cloth remained stable. Only fine twill rose by another 0.05 yuan (per piece) due to the shortage of spot goods. Local traders traded a total of about six or seven hundred packages of fine cloth and fine twill. The Yantai gang in North Road also collected more than 100 packages of Qingdao fine cloth of Shuanglongzhu, Huaniao, Longmen, and Yanxi brands. Since the Sichuan gang started trading, in addition to a small amount of billige and blue cloth, they also bought 1,500 pieces of Taohuawu brand lower-grade plain silk, priced at 0.29 yuan per yard. This is the first time that the Sichuan gang has purchased colored goods since the opening of the market, and it may be able to gradually encourage them in the future, which makes the traders feel excited and the market situation is very stable.

### Model Domestic Product Family Exhibition

— Yang An

The Shanghai Domestic Products Movement United Association recently plans to hold a model domestic product family exhibition. This event has a great effect on the promotion of domestic products. We believe that it is worth holding, but there are several aspects that we can contribute to in the implementation.

First, the four words "model domestic product" mean that there will be first-class domestic products. Therefore, the selection of goods must be strict and must be genuine, and it is better to have fewer products than to have substandard ones. In particular, we must pay close attention to the quality standards of domestic products. If it is below the fifth grade, calling it a model domestic product will always feel inappropriate.

Second, model domestic products should be categorized into food, clothing, daily necessities, stationery, cosmetics, travel products, and even building materials. The scope of collection should be based on the standards of low price, good quality, and purely domestic production.

Third, a model domestic product family does not have to be magnificent and luxurious, and there is no need to compete in extravagance. We can set out several methods according to the amount of income and the abundance of living power of each family. For example, how to arrange a family with a salary of 200 yuan, how to arrange a family with a salary of 100 yuan, and how to arrange a family with a salary of 40 yuan, so as to provide a practical reference for people of all classes, so that they have a basis when using domestic products. This is very important.

We hope that factories and all sectors of society will do their best to support this exhibition and open it as soon as possible, which will have a great effect on the domestic product industry.

### Suggestions for Improving Domestic Product Sales

— Xuan Wan

Recently, our domestic product industry has relied on the widespread establishment of the majority of the public's confidence in protecting domestic products on the one hand, and on the other hand, it has relied on the bumper harvest in rural areas and the increase in the purchasing power of the general people in the interior. In terms of the comparison of enclosure sales, there has obviously been considerable progress. The gradual increase in the turnover of many domestic product manufacturers is indeed a very good phenomenon.

However, at present, we deeply feel that the domestic product industry should seize this opportunity and make greater efforts to pay attention to the improvement of domestic product sales techniques. We know that the reason why foreign goods were able to dump everywhere in our country, penetrate into remote rural areas, was mainly because they had a high degree of sales methods that could adapt to the actual conditions of various parts of our country. Therefore, it was able to possess such a large market and obtain huge sales. At present, it is also very necessary and urgent for us to strive to improve sales methods. Below, I have a few practical suggestions for improving domestic product sales in the future, and I dare to contribute them to people engaged in the domestic product industry:

First, pay attention to the packaging of domestic products. This is one of the most important things to pay attention to in improving the sales of domestic products. On the one hand, we must make the decoration of the goods so that buyers have a good impression of them, and we must cater to the aesthetic concepts of the local people and make different decorations. On the other hand, we should pay attention to strict packaging so that the quality of the goods is always preserved and correct the shortcomings of the past when domestic goods were often missing or damaged during transportation.

Second, pay attention to advertising and publicity. The ability of advertising and publicity to promote sales has long been noticed by the domestic product industry, but in the future, we should make it play a practical role, and we must conduct specific research according to the different industries, local markets, and target sales objects. In particular, we should pay attention to making in-depth efforts in expanding sales in border areas and opening up overseas markets.

Third, pay attention to the politeness of store clerks. How to cater to the psychology of customers? In the past, the outside world often criticized the store clerks of domestic product manufacturers for lacking politeness, so in the future, peacetime training of store clerks will also be one of the main topics in improving domestic product sales.

Other things, such as the need for speedy and cheap transportation of domestic products, the need for continuous improvement of the quality of domestic products, and the need for attention to the layout of shopping malls or stores, are of course all necessary to be done in improving domestic product sales. At this time when the future of domestic products is gradually improving, we hope that the domestic product industry can make greater efforts to obtain greater development of domestic production.

### The Decline of Agriculture in Haiyan, Silk and Cloth

— Zhu Qin

Our country has always been known as an agricultural country, and the people are engaged in agriculture. In addition to planting large quantities of rice, wheat, cotton, and flax, the Jiangzhe area is also a gathering area for sericulture. Farmers take silkworm rearing as a sideline in their spare time from farming to supplement the farmers' economy.

In recent years, the dumping of foreign goods has been rampant, and the output of foreign silk has increased sharply. Both trade and materials are better than our country. Moreover, artificial silk has caused a fatal blow to our country's silk. On the other hand, our country's silk industry is on the road to decline, which is heartbreaking to say. Our country's methods of silkworm rearing and mulberry planting have followed the old methods for thousands of years. Compared with the sericulture industry in Europe and the United States and East Asian countries such as Japan, it is no wonder that it pales in comparison. The facts are obvious. People use scientific methods, while we follow the old rules, as if it were the same for thousands of years, and we do not know how to improve. Now that science is advocated, we still do not rush to catch up. Although we have heard that the government has plans to revitalize the countryside, and some people are shouting to save the countryside, the plans are, after all, plans, and the shouts are still in our ears. The farmers' pain is still invading the depths of the water and fire. Seeing this, the future of our country's silk industry will eventually be in danger and will be destroyed by foreign silk.

The other day, my friend Ren Wenhui came to Shanghai from Haiyan and talked about the recent decline of agriculture, cotton, silk, and linen cloth in Haiyan, which I felt very earnestly. After hearing about it, I felt something and briefly recorded it to publish in this magazine.

After the sericulture affairs are over, the farm women in Haiyan use manual labor to make extremely fine cotton threads from thin-skinned cocoons such as double palace cocoons; some split flax into strands and weave them into silk and cloth with wooden machines, which are sold in the nearby areas and make a good profit. Unfortunately, this handicraft industry lacks the organization of a whole silk weaving factory in Haiyan, and there is also a lack of good guidance and sticking to the old ways, so it cannot reach far to other provinces and be sold overseas. Recently, we are actively promoting domestic products. If we can invest in the rural areas of the area, set up silk weaving factories, and improve guidance, the silk and cloth produced will be strong and durable, and the price will be low and the quality will be good, which is far better than imported goods.

In Yongan Lake, more than 20 miles away from the county seat, residents use manual labor to split flax into strands and make linen cloth with wooden machines (commonly known as Ganpu summer cloth) in the summer. It is sold in nearby counties, and its color is yellow and white. The yellow one is called Sun, and the white one is quite good, and can be used to make summer clothes. In the past year, the local agencies, groups, gentry, etc. initiated the use of yellow linen cloth to make various summer uniforms, which are worn on the body. Even in the scorching sun, when sweating profusely, it is not greasy with sweat, and it is extremely cool and comfortable. In addition to the local woven linen cloth, in the four townships of Haiyan, elderly farmers who cannot work in the fields are engaged in weaving silk cotton. All the double palace and thin-skinned cocoons are boiled in boiling water, immersed in water, and pounded with a wooden pestle on the lake for more than ten days. After they are evenly mixed, they are dried in the sun, and then the fine silk is completely pinched by hand and woven with a wooden machine, which is called cotton silk. This cotton silk is also divided into coarse and fine, rough and white. The fine white one can be used for summer shirts and short clothes, etc., and the rough and turbid one can be dyed and used as underwear in autumn and winter. It is soft and fitting, but it is woven by hand and with wooden machines, so the products cannot compete with machine-woven silk products. However, its durability is ten thousand times greater than that of the current silk, and the price is low. The highest price is only a little more than 0.1 yuan per foot, and the lowest price is only a few cents per foot. (To be continued)

### Factory Inspection and Domestic Industry

— Ba Ling

The Shanghai Factory Inspection Office was officially established on February 21 of this year and has begun operations. This is not only good news for all factories in Shanghai, but especially something that domestic factories in general feel gratified about. Because the implementation of factory inspections and the future of domestic industry are closely related.

In recent years, the cause of domestic products in our country has been maintained and promoted by the government authorities, and the people of all walks of life are happy to use them, which is a very significant achievement compared to a few years ago. However, if we examine the contents of a ship of domestic factories, either the safety and health equipment are not perfect, or the management technology is lacking training, so that factory disasters have not yet reached the point of complete avoidance. The explosion of the boiler in the Zhengtai Rubber Factory and the Taiyi Malted Milk Powder Factory, and the fire in the Shanghai Da Zhonghua Binluoluo Factory were all encountered great losses and many obstacles. The repeated performances of this kind of factory disaster not only have a great impact on the domestic factory itself, but the entire domestic industry is also invisibly encountering considerable obstacles. Therefore, how to prevent industrial disasters and prevent domestic factories from being hit by accidents? This is not only a problem that the principals of domestic factories should strive to solve, but from the perspective of the domestic industry, it is also a problem that we should jointly study and discuss.

The author believes that there are many factors to avoid the occurrence of disasters, and the practical implementation of factory inspection is indeed an effective method to reduce factory disasters. Because the work of the Factory Inspection Office is not only concerned with the factory's various records, the work conditions of child laborers, female workers, and apprentices, and the investigation of disasters, deaths, and injuries, but especially concerned with whether the factory's safety and health equipment have reached a truly proper state, in order to fundamentally eliminate factory disasters and the workers' physical health is becoming healthier day by day. This kind of work seems to be unimportant from the superficial observation, but in fact, it is closely related to the entire domestic industry, whether directly or indirectly. Because the implementation of factory inspection can directly reduce the occurrence of factory disasters, and indirectly can make the products faster and the production rate increase. At this time when the domestic industry is waiting to be supported and developed, and the people of the country are gradually happy to use domestic products, we hope that the Shanghai Factory Inspection Office can actively promote inspection work and earnestly guide the safety and health equipment of factories, which will greatly benefit the domestic product production industry. The author is pleased and willing to wait and see its effect.

### From the Homespun Movement to the Tai Couple

— Dulin

Chinese women's pursuit of luxury, in their every move, they constantly imitate Western trends and compete to show off their extravagance and wealth. Therefore, "clothes must be brocade," and "residences must be luxurious," planting deep-rooted vanity in their hearts. Even women who have received higher education often cannot escape this bad idea. If you don't believe it, let's look at a fact.

In the news about the divorce of Dr. Tai Shuangqiu, the former dean of the Education Institute of Great China University, and Ms. Huang Jima, one can find a profound irony. The fact is this:

Dr. Shao Shuangqiu is a well-known figure in the education field. He usually loves domestic products and promotes homespun cloth, sparing no effort to promote it everywhere, persuading people he meets, and practicing it tirelessly. He wears homespun cloth made from raw materials spun and woven in the countryside all year round. His ardent heart is commendable. However, his wife, Ms. Huang Jima, strongly opposed it. Therefore, although Dr. Tai wore homespun cloth all year round, his wife at home may still have been "wearing brocade."

Because of Dr. Tai's ardent love for domestic products, he promoted it everywhere and persuaded people he met. Once, someone suddenly questioned Dr. Tai: Although Mr. Tai wears homespun cloth all year round, has he persuaded his own family to wear it too? As a result, Dr. Tai received a deep and mocking stimulus. When he returned home, he also persuaded his wife to wear homespun cloth, but the result was not only that she could not comply, but also that they disagreed and broke up. Although their divorce was officially justified, citing a difference in interests, they went through the divorce procedures at the lawyer's office and filed the case with the court. It is said that although they were divorced later, Mrs. Tai probably followed Dr. Tai's advice and wore homespun cloth. Suddenly, news of reconciliation came out, but in the end, they could not reach an agreement and eventually divorced.

Dr. Shao promoted the homespun movement with such a sincere heart. Although he lost his lover, he still practiced it tirelessly and did not change it at all. Now, Dr. Tai, through discussions from all sides and his own choice, has found a new wife with similar interests, Ms. Hu Peizhen, who is said to be married at the Xueyi Society on the 28th of this month. However, the union of Dr. Tai and Ms. Huang Jima was a marriage that developed from classmates, and both were engaged in education, so their views were of course superior to others. However, unexpectedly, Mrs. Tai overturned the feelings of the couple and was willing to divorce at all costs because she did not want to wear homespun cloth. From this, it can be seen that the vanity of ordinary women is more important than anything else. Here, I have another feeling: that Dr. Tai's persuasion for people to wear homespun cloth is so sincere, but he did not expect that even his wife, who is also engaged in education, could not be persuaded. How about other people who have not received education? I can't help but feel a deep pessimism about the future of pure domestic products.

### Today and Tomorrow

— Wu Shou Kang

Today's business must be done today; if you wait until tomorrow, at least tomorrow's business will be eroded and damaged!

"Hope for tomorrow today, hope for the day after tomorrow tomorrow, and you'll never get it right in your life!"—This is a colloquialism.

Only today, only now, is there hope, and it should be seized and not allowed to slip away lightly.

A person who puts things off every day, his ideals will always be bubbles. Because when tomorrow comes, he is waiting for tomorrow again and will never realize it!

Tomorrow, tomorrow, everyone will have a day when there is no tomorrow!

I really don't know how many people in the world have ruined their entire future careers because of waiting for tomorrow?

Today is real and can be cashed; tomorrow is abstract and intangible.

Friends! Opportunity stands before you, today! Don't miss it!

"Wait for tomorrow! Wait for tomorrow!" Thousands of people in the world have been frustrated and failed because of it.

### Street of Never-Sleeping

— Jiao Shijie

Shanghai is a city that never sleeps, and the street of never-sleeping in the city that never sleeps is Zhejiang Road.

Between Great Horse Road and Beijing Road, this section of Zhejiang Road can indeed be called a commercial hub, and especially the night market, it surpasses the prosperity of Nanjing Road, no, it surpasses any street in Shanghai!

Although Shanghai is a prosperous place, after 12 o'clock at night, every street gradually becomes deserted. Most of the merchants are closed, and the sparse pedestrians on the road can no longer make it lively. The trams have stopped, and only one or two cars pass by. Thus, even the most prosperous Great Horse Road during the day seems to be tired and dead, leaving only the light of the street lamps. Although when the theaters and dance halls are dismissed, a large group of tired people come out, but in an instant, this lively scene is quiet again, and even if it is lively, it is only a small piece of liveliness, how can it compare to the liveliness of Zhejiang Road!

On Zhejiang Road, this street of never-sleeping, there are many shops selling shoes and hats, restaurants, and small department stores. In the windows of those shops, the lights of neon lights are shining everywhere, and the voices of people are warm and bustling; when the west wind blows, the flags of Yangcheng Lake crabs suddenly increase on this road. Usually, there are also constant fruit vendors, arranged in a line, shouting their wares with different voices but the same tune.

When the lights are on and the tourists are like a swarm of bees, the prostitutes on the street are dispatched like a general mobilization order. Wearing dazzling clothes, smearing white powder, and applying red rouge, they patrol back and forth, exuding fragrance like flowers and plants, to seduce bees and butterflies to go crazy.

The prosperity of Zhejiang Road extends all the way to three or four o'clock, even dawn. Ah, this is the street that never sleeps!

The city that never sleeps has the street that never sleeps, so it deserves its name. The street that never sleeps is sheltered in the city that never sleeps, boosting its prosperity.

### Preface to the Secret Transmission of the Golden Needle

— Song Guobin

The method of golden needles has been around for a long time. Some say it was created by the Yellow Emperor, but when I read the Biography of Bian Que and Cang Gong in the Records of the Grand Historian, I know that this method was already popular between the Zhou and Qin dynasties. Although the statement that the Yellow Emperor created it may be a forgery, it is undoubtedly the oldest and most scientific medical technique in Chinese medicine. Its transmission is mostly taught by masters and disciples, emphasizing practice rather than empty talk. Scholars often suffer from the difficulty of recognizing acupoints and give up. Therefore, its transmission is narrow, and it is declining today. How can a few inches of needles cure all diseases? Those who study science may doubt its absurdity. However, the meridians and acupoints are not unrelated to the sympathetic nervous system, and the efficacy of acupuncture is not different from the effect of endocrine. Although its technique is magical, its principle is true and cannot be doubted by what cannot be explained in anatomy. For this reason, advanced countries in European medicine have paid attention to this. The Paris Municipal Hospital recently established a Chinese acupuncture department, and many diseases are treated with golden needles. The medical school also uses scientific methods for concrete research. But in our country it is not the case. Most people in this field secretly hide their skills. Those who have a smattering of knowledge are needless to say, even those who have a thorough understanding of it are mostly secretive. Those who ask about it, some tell one or two, and hide seven or eight, or show the surface and hide the essence, or strongly say that it is difficult, so that the questioner knows the difficulty and stops, or make absurd remarks, so that scholars take the false as true. Even their disciples are not willing to teach them wholeheartedly, let alone others? Knowing but not willing to speak, speaking but not willing to tell all, in order to leave room for self-preservation, and ignoring the preservation of learning, this is the reason why acupuncture is declining in China. Fang Jun Shen'an is a golden needle expert today. He hangs his pot on the sea and is famous for a time. He has always hated the secrecy of his colleagues and feared the loss of acupuncture because of this. Those who ask for advice must tell him the secrets; and he wrote a book called Secret Transmission of Golden Needles to promote acupuncture to the world. His intention is good. Learning is a public tool of the world, and medicine is a benevolent technique to help the world. Secrecy is to regard public tools as private property and to regard benevolent techniques as a way to profit. Jun has seen this, so he wrote out his master's true biography and made it public to the world. Isn't it a benevolent intention? Jun's exposition of acupuncture is already detailed and without omission, and there are more than ten acupoints for the solution of fainting needles, which is not comparable to ordinary golden needle books. Those who are interested in this, take it and read it, and can understand its secrets without a teacher, isn't it better than seeking a teacher for thousands of miles and never getting the hang of it for life? This is why I am happy to write a preface to it.

### Yang Guifei's Stealing

— Hua Binghe

Accidentally, I talked with a few friends about the story of stealing, starting from Dongfang Shuo stealing peaches, then Chang'e stealing medicine, then Han Shou stealing incense, and finally talking about Yang Guifei.

A wife is not as good as a concubine, a concubine is not as good as stealing, but is it not so for women; I remember that in the Outer Biography of Dazhen, there is such a record: "There are three sisters, all plump and well-groomed, good at teasing and joking, and good at meaning. Every time they enter the palace, they move the square out... Therefore, Zhang You sometimes said: 'Sneaking into Korea with a secret visit, the Yichun courtyard reflects the flowering branches. The golden chariot goes far away and no one sees it, secretly playing the flute of Prince He.'" This word "stealing" is very tasteful, and Zhang You himself said in his poem: "No one sees the pear blossoms in the deep courtyard, idly playing the jade flute of Prince Ning." From these two poems, it is not difficult to imagine how promiscuous Guifei was.

Regarding Guifei and An Lushan, Yuan Suiyuan has two lines of poetry: "The Old and New Tang Books are clearly there, how can there be money to wash away Lujian." That's right, the Old Tang Book does not record this matter, no wonder Suiyuan is proud of being able to clear Guifei's grievances, considering it his most得意手笔; in fact, even if there is such a thing, thinking from the meaning of stealing, it is a bit too stupid, not to mention that Guifei is an exceptionally smart woman, and Ming Huang is not a fool after all.

However, I am always a little suspicious that when she was admiring the peonies in the Chenxiang Pavilion, she clearly liked Li Taibai's Qingping Tune, because there were words comparing her to Zhao Feiyan, and she was inexplicably angered by Taibai because of a few 胡縐words, if she did not steal, she would be too suspicious.

### The Xixia People's Worship of Cattle

— Liping

Xixia, within the territory of China, is considered a remote land. The residents there mostly maintain a state of ancient society, so all lifestyles are somewhat mythologized. Especially the worship of cattle is the only sacred thing in the superstition of the Xixia people.

In the eyes of the Xixia people, the cattle god is almost more sacred than all the gods. Therefore, all life is mostly dominated by the authority of the cattle god. For example, marriage, when local men and women are to be married, they must go to the temple of the cattle god to ask for a decision. If the cattle god's decision is good, then no matter how unsuitable the marriage is, it must be accomplished. If the cattle god's decision is not good, everyone has to do as they are told and dare not resist. At the same time, the wedding date is also determined by the god. On the wedding day, the newly married men and women, parents, clan chiefs, etc. must also go to the cattle god temple to hold the wedding ceremony. In addition to marriage, what is more interesting is having children. If a son is born, the pregnant woman must go to the temple every day to pray within a month before delivery. On the day the son is born, a cow is pulled from outside and the newborn child is snuggled next to the cow. Only after spending the night can the child be carried into the house. After the full moon, the child must be tied to the back of the cow for a whole day. On the day of entertaining guests, the cow is slaughtered to be used as a dish for entertaining guests. The above two customs are a kind of superstition of worshiping cattle in Xixia.

Mail Agent: Gentlemen Ziqing and Daping, I respectfully acknowledge the great teaching.

Special Feature

### A Tour of the Limin Coal Mine in Xishan, Dongting

— Luo Zheng

For the past few days, I have been trapped in the house by the continuous cold rain, and I couldn't even go to town once. The boundless loneliness surrounded me, making me feel disgusted with this desolate village life. Fortunately, the rain stopped today, so the wish to visit the Limin Coal Mine, which I have had for a week, can finally be realized.

After passing Tianwangmen, you can see a row of black bamboo fences. In the middle of the black bamboo fences, we found a city gate-like gate. Beside it, a copper plaque was quietly hung, and the regular script characters of "Limin Coal Mine Company" were smiling at us.

Walking through the gate, you can see the busy scene inside the mine. The noisy sound suddenly filled my ears. We went to the office on the left first, but it was quiet and there was no one there. In front of the warehouse, we met the mine director Zhao Jun. He was directing the construction project below the mine tunnel. Seeing him holding a construction ruler in his hand, running back and forth, he looked very busy, but when he saw us, he put down his work and greeted us with a smile.

We seemed to be very familiar with it and automatically broke into the inside. Zhao Jun also followed us. In front of a mine tunnel, there were many miners working. The sound of the motor was軋軋軋, which was fast or slow depending on the impact of the mine board. The black coal blocks were hoisted from the mine tunnel, which was thirty-two feet deep, to the mine site by the motor winch, one basket after another. Then, the four-wheeled iron car carried them, climbed along the winding narrow-gauge railway, and sent them into the warehouse.

The sharp whistle sounded three times in the gray air. The miners who were on shift all put on black, shiny oilcloth clothes and hats, gathered in the workshop, lit their small carbide lamps, and were assigned by the foreman to wait at the mouth of the mine tunnel with this shift's supervisors to change shifts. The winch quickly hoisted up from the ground below, bringing up groups of coal miners. Their faces were all covered with black marks, and their clothes were wet. Each person held a carbide lamp in their hand, and the small flame was swaying in the wind. At the same time, groups of miners on the mine site were sent by the winch to the black and deep coal well.

After seeing the mine tunnel, we wanted to go down ourselves and experience the life under the ground, but according to Zhao Jun, to go down the tunnel, you must wear oilcloth clothes and hats. Today, the mine engineer Wang Xifan, the general manager Wang Ziweng, and others will all go down. When the company's oilcloth clothes are available in a day, you can let me wear them down once. Afterwards, we were led by Zhao Jun to inspect the mining area and visit the workshops of the miners, carpenters, bamboo workers, motors, and water pumps. Behind the workshop of the engineering office, countless pine trees were piled up. It is said that they were the wood for the project below the mine tunnel. They usually had thousands of dollars worth of wood stored. Now they are still sorting out the mine tunnel, and the amount of coal produced is only enough for their own use. In the future, when the second mine tunnel is sorted out and coal mining officially starts, the amount of wood needed will be even more extensive. While we were talking, General Affairs Director Yu came with Mr. Wang Ziweng and others. He greeted Mr. Wang and others to go down the mine tunnel, and then came to entertain us. So we talked to him in a delicate and simple reception room about the mine situation and the coal mine overview, until it rained and we bid farewell.

### Phoenix and Luan Change Nests

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter Twelve: White Paper and Red Letter Empty Return Two Lines of Moji Flowers and Maple Leaves Alone Walk Half a City in Autumn

Xiao Song seemed to take this sentence very seriously. He put down the teacup, pressed his knees with both hands, and looked at him and said: Don't think that the characters in Zhaoqiao Miscellaneous Records are all vulgar. There are also some admirable women here. You are not willing to go to this kind of place. If you supervise me to go to these places to see them twice, you will definitely not be able to deny them all. Guoqi bowed his hands twice. Although he didn't say anything, on his smiling face, he clearly declined. Xiao Song saw this situation and didn't continue to talk. He said: I copied these poems of yours. How about I write a few to match them? Guoqi said: I haven't finished writing the novel yet, and you want to write poems to match them. It seems that everyone is promoting each other a little. After I publish them in the magazine, you can write them. Xiao Song laughed: As I see it, these poems of yours will never be published. Saying that, he got up and folded the poems several times, put them in the drawer, took the hat hanging on the hanger in his hand, bowed half a bow to him, and smiled: I think you want to write more than just these few poems. I'm interrupting your poetic inspiration here. Saying that, he hurried out. Guoqi felt that his departure was somewhat due to avoiding suspicion, and he felt even more uneasy, so he followed behind and sent him out of the gate. And he was talking, sending him to the entrance of the alley. At this time, a girl came in front of her, wearing a green cotton-padded jacket with a mandarin duck pattern and a long cyan crepe skirt. The black patent leather shoes made a slight sound on the ground. Her forehead had long bangs hanging down, and her snow-white face had two light red blushes, which were very beautiful. Xiao Song saw her from afar and felt that his eyes were absorbed by her. When she slowly walked in front of him, her big eyes drooped her eyelids, surrounding two eyelashes on the outside. (149)

Talking

### More on Kicking Shuttlecock and Flying Kites

— Me

The day before yesterday, I saw the order from the Central Propaganda Department advocating kicking shuttlecocks and flying kites, which aroused my interest in the games of my childhood, so I wrote an article. Unexpectedly, after this article was written, before it was sent to this publication, Mr. Luo's article on the same topic had already been published. Fortunately, although the topics are the same, the feelings are different, and there are some supplementary opinions in my humble work, so I will still send this manuscript. I am afraid that there will inevitably be the shame of drawing a snake and adding feet. I hope the readers will forgive me.

If you talk about kicking shuttlecocks and flying kites, I can be considered an old insider, because I am old and an insider. I can be regarded as worthy of the three words old insider. Speaking of kicking shuttlecocks? I am proficient in the eight skills of lifting, accompanying, turning, bumping, left, practicing, rare, and 跥. The so-called 跥 is to kick the shuttlecock high with the back of the foot. I can't write the word 跥, so let's replace it with the word 跥? In addition, there is also打跳. The so-called 打跳 is to jump up and kick high backwards with the right foot. This is a further step in the art of kicking shuttlecocks. Speaking of flying kites? I have flown many kinds of kites, such as big colorful kites, small colorful kites, figure kites, eagle kites, butterfly kites, toilet kites, and centipede kites. And I have a lot of research and experience, because when I was young, I was reluctant to study, but I had a special interest and special preference for the above two games, so I am especially authentic in these two things.

However, the most suffered person was an old mother, because of the sake of kicking shuttlecocks and flying kites, I often got muddy and fought like frogs, and one pair of shoes a month was not enough. The toes of the shoes were often broken and the soles of the socks were worn through. Therefore, I often got scolded as a useless thing, a beggar's坯子. But let her scold as much as she wants, and let her beat as much as she wants. I can't help but fly kites, and I can't help but kick shuttlecocks. Now I think about it, it is really unjust and sinful to eat this kind of scolding. I regret that I was born decades earlier. Assuming that I was born decades later, not only could I avoid eating this kind of scolding, but I could also take the kites and shuttlecocks and wander away like I was ordered by the emperor. Parents would only smile at it, or even praise my good son.

I still think about when I was young, not only did I have the above two hobbies, but I also had a special art, which was rolling copper coins. I think this game is more interesting than flying kites and kicking shuttlecocks, because rolling copper coins all depends on eyesight and technique. The distance and bias of the coins depends on the hand, and the hitting of the coins depends on the eye. Therefore, this game has a close relationship with the eyesight and technique of children, and there is a lot of research. When I was more than ten years old, I could hit the coin from one or two feet away, and I could measure it. I was an expert in rolling copper coins among the children. Therefore, several children, seeing that I was inside, often stood by and watched, unwilling to cooperate with me, because cooperation would definitely lead to my loss. I have an obligation to be the best at these children's games in the feudal era.

The central government advocates kicking shuttlecocks and flying kites. I think the game of rolling copper coins may also be promoted, because the reason why the central government advocates kicking shuttlecocks and flying kites is nothing more than to increase the physical strength and activity of children, which has a great relationship with the health of children. However, the game of rolling copper coins is also very beneficial to children's eyesight and technique. And kites are only flown in spring, and kicking shuttlecocks is mostly in winter. They are mostly seasonal. Only rolling copper coins is possible at any time, whether spring, summer, autumn, or winter. It is easier to practice skillfully. Assuming that the age is slightly older, or military training, when hitting the target, or when war occurs, when enlisting in the army, their shooting ability will definitely surpass ordinary people. This is why rolling copper coins also needs to be promoted.

### "Wise Mother"'s "Motherly Education"

— Xin Xin

With more than ten days left until Children's Day, a certain women's education center has already decided on the methods for the "Motherly Education Competition" to be held on Children's Day and has published it in the newspaper. This shows their concern for children, which is truly admirable.

Examining the reasons for holding the "Motherly Education Competition," the "Competition Purpose" states it clearly: "This center aims to promote the sense of responsibility among mothers in each family and to create a social atmosphere that values wise mothers. Therefore, we have decided to hold the Motherly Education Competition once every year on Children's Day." The competition items are divided into ㊀ Physique, ㊁ Cleanliness, ㊂ Politeness, ㊃ Demeanor. The scoring method is as follows: Physique is graded out of 30 points, Cleanliness out of 20 points, and Politeness and Demeanor are each graded out of 25 points.

Now, let's first talk about "wise mother." Mr. Guo Moruo said in an essay titled "On Turning Heaven and Earth": "The way of concubines in ancient times, such as 'not disobeying the husband to make obedience the correct path,' or 'following the son after the husband's death,' or 'a mother becomes noble through her son,' does not even qualify as a wife or a mother, let alone being considered 'wise' or 'good,' right? However, such wives and mothers who are slaves to cosmetics and also slaves to the family are precisely the 'wise wives and good mothers' that ancient people and even some people today long for. The reason why such wives and mothers are 'wise' and 'good' is probably because they are like 'clear breeze and bright moon that don't cost a penny to buy, which is much more economical than prostitutes and wet nurses, right?'" He then used a biological perspective to advocate for "turning heaven and earth" in many ways. After reading the "purpose" of the "Motherly Education Competition"—"to promote the sense of responsibility among mothers in each family and to create a social atmosphere that values wise mothers"—I cannot help but think of what he said: "They painstakingly want to bind women's fate to the lifelong and hereditary position of obligatory prostitutes and wet nurses, and they beautify it by calling them wise wives and good mothers." And this sobering taste of 'wisdom and goodness' seems to have once again intoxicated the Nalas of the past and called them back to the 'dollhouse'." (See the same article)

If the so-called "wise mother" is like this, then what are the children under such "motherly education" of a "wise mother" like? They can be roughly divided into two types. One type, we can imagine from the three competition items, must be children who are chubby and white and have "education," with very clean clothes, know to wash their hands before eating, and perhaps even say "Yes" or "No" when "responding." When they see unclean little companions, they may quickly avoid them, or even kick them a few times with their little leather shoes, or tell the maids to drive the "little beggars" away.

These children with "education," when graded, will naturally be given a "perfect score." As for the children under the "motherly education" of the other type of "wise mother," their physique may have a few points that are naturally endowed, barely enough to pass, but most of them suffer from congenital deficiencies and acquired maladjustments, and are mostly "skin and bones." As for cleanliness, politeness, and demeanor, there is naturally no need to mention them. Because they are used to being kicked by the former type of children, they can only timidly hide when they see them, lest they get a few more bruises on their buttocks. Even if there are those who are unwilling to submit and dare to fight back, it is obviously too bad in terms of "politeness" and they still fail.

The latter type of children, of course, will not even have the qualifications to participate in the competition. For example, "All participants must be led by their mothers to the center to register, submit two 4-inch half-length photos of the mother and child or mother and daughter, receive a competition certificate, and come to the center for the competition at the specified date and time." They will not have such spare time and photos. In fact, even if they did, they would definitely use this money and spare time to sew a new dress for their children first, and then take their children to the City God Temple or something to kowtow to the wooden idols, asking the Bodhisattva to protect their children as they grow up.

Now, there are more than ten days left until Children's Day. On that day, in addition to this "Motherly Education Competition" that "promotes the sense of responsibility among mothers" and "creates a social atmosphere that values wise mothers," there will definitely be other new and fresh things. However, what will our children get? It is hard to say.

According to my current thoughts, I want to cancel Children's Day.

### The Great Pharmacy

— Sky

Complete Consultation Rooms

If you take trolleybus No. 17 to Simalu and Henan Road, you can hear the ticket seller shouting: "Wuzhou Pharmacy has arrived." From this point, you can know the fame of Wuzhou Pharmacy.

Wuzhou Pharmacy is famous not only because of its wide range and excellent products, but also because it can use various methods to enthusiastically serve the community at any time. For example, the ten-story building of the main store has specially opened medical consultation rooms for various departments inside (on the fourth floor, accessible by elevator). The consultation rooms are very well-equipped, and each department is staffed by famous doctors from Shanghai who are responsible for treatment, eliminating the disadvantages of being simple and negligent. Furthermore, in view of the fact that patients often have to wait a long time to fill prescriptions, which inevitably causes anxiety, a prescription receiving office is specially attached to the consultation room department. After the diagnosis, the prescription is filled immediately and can be taken back for consumption, which is very convenient.

The great pharmacy has complete consultation rooms, making it convenient for patients to both consult a doctor and fill a prescription. How can this not be said to be the gospel of the community?

### The Unfortunate Person

— Guan Yinxi

Three years ago, on a gloomy afternoon, the mud worker foreman left her and an not-so-small estate behind, and went to sleep forever in a pair of floral-patterned wooden beds.

From then on, she began to manage those properties without help or care. From a young age, she was a bit silly, clumsy, and didn't understand the ways of the world. After marriage, other than her leisurely physique becoming stronger, nothing changed. Initially, she let several acres of vegetable gardens go to waste, and then even the orchards were neglected. Therefore, the neighbors held a mocking attitude. First, they often sneaked into the vegetable garden at night to steal cucumbers and cabbages, or pretended to unintentionally let cattle and sheep in; then, they instructed those naughty teenagers to climb over the walls and pick large bags of fruit when the fruits were ripe.

The first season passed, and the manager of the property lost sixty-five percent of her total harvest. Only then did she discover how the neighbors were stealing without her noticing! She became frantic, brandishing a short wooden stick in her hand and sitting on the stone steps in front of the door, cursing all day long. The neighbors who were being cursed dared not come out to argue, but pointed at the naughty teenagers, brought their dogs, and came out to throw stones at her. When a stone was thrown at her, the dog followed to try to bite the stone, but she thought it was coming to bite her, so she shouted and threatened, raising the short wooden stick in her hand to hit it. This angered the dog, and she was injured as a result.

For a long time, she lay down, and dirty blood flowed from her legs. She couldn't run, she could only crawl. The neighbors felt very proud. They no longer had to sneak into her vegetable garden late at night, nor did they have to instruct people to dare to enter her orchard. They openly stole cucumbers and fruits. Later, when there were no more cucumbers and the fruit season passed, they carried hoes and axes to dig up the barren tree trunks in the orchard, and then chopped them into hundreds of small pieces for firewood. Sometimes, because the distribution of this loot was uneven, the neighbors fought, using hoes and short wooden sticks, and sometimes even using knives to stab each other. It wasn't until a series of muffled coughs came from the small house that they timidly dropped their weapons and hid in the weeds.

She was sick for a long time, and she lost her health. Having grown accustomed to crawling, she couldn't stand up. Sometimes she forgot and tried to stand up, but the result was only tears in her eyes, shaking her head and sitting down again. She was disabled.

Her face was thin and pale, but she hadn't lost her beauty. The death of the mud worker foreman, the encroachment on her property, the illness, the disability, none of them made her smarter. She still lived in a daze, not understanding everything, not believing in everything...

After her illness, because the long period of indoor life was too dull, she came out with the help of a wooden stool and sat on the stone steps to bask in the sun, or took off her lower body clothes to find fleas. Her plump, unspoiled body of a young woman, like her orchard and cucumbers, became attractive. At this time, her orchard was so bare that there wasn't even a single weed, the fence outside the vegetable garden had already been broken, and there was nothing but weeds in the field.

Soon, late at night, bold and impoverished young men from the neighbors lingered outside her desolate door. When he saw that the surroundings were quiet, he gently pushed the door open and went in. How he subdued her inside, how he made her lie naked on the dirty bed, no one knows. However, people often heard sobbing and panting, until a shadow flashed out from the back door, and all the mysterious sounds became silent again.

The news spread, and about a dozen young men rotated through her house at midnight. But when her belly developed a strange change and swelled up, she was forgotten like a pair of broken straw shoes.

On a peaceful, warm spring night, someone heard a small burst of infant crying coming from the house. The next day, they saw that the little life was already cold, but she was still holding it tightly to her naked chest as if she were holding a living thing, with a smile of happiness on the corner of her mouth that had never been seen before.

### The Prosperous American Automobile Export Industry

— Ke

The American automobile export industry in 1936 can be said to have been the best year since 1929. Therefore, people in the automobile industry predict that the export industry this year—1937—will also have a bright future. It is said that there are two reasons for the prosperity of American automobile exports. One is the dominance of foreign exchange, and the other is the recovery and prosperity of various industries, both of which are conducive to the export industry. In particular, the abolition of tariff barriers and the replacement with reciprocal commercial agreements have resulted in the improvement of the export industry.

If we look back at the American automobile overseas sales market in 1929, we can see that the overseas sales were not bad at that time. Including the production volume in Canada, the number of American exports at that time had reached as high as 1,000,000 vehicles. However, the arrival of the recession turned the good results into a complete failure. In 1932, American automobile exporters only reached 181,280 vehicles. Compared with the total number in 1929, isn't that a sharp decline? Fortunately, from that year on, the situation gradually improved, and the overseas market for American automobiles gradually had hope of recovery. By 1936, the number of exports had reached about 600,000 vehicles.

The heads of the export departments of American automobile factories all have the hope of rebuilding the good dream of 1929. In fact, reaching the old position of 1,000,000 vehicles is not a simple matter. However, some people always yearn to reach that number of one million vehicles. So when is this time? It is said that this period is 1937. Regarding this statement, if we want to explain the reasons in detail, then most of the automobile factory leaders are very confident that their export volume can increase by 20% in 1937. The only condition for achieving this goal is to see how they proceed to achieve greater success in commercial agreements. Among the many foreign markets in the United States, South Africa has undoubtedly become the single largest market for American automobiles. Last year, the sales of American automobiles there exceeded any other region. Therefore, everyone has high hopes for her this year as well.

There are also many good customers of American automobiles in Europe, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia, all of which have good markets. There is a specially built ship that transports automobiles directly from Gedero to Norway, Switzerland, and Denmark. Their route starts from the United States, passes through the Great Lakes, and goes forward. The shipment of American automobiles to France, Italy, and Germany has not yet seen much increase. This is because the tariff barriers of these countries have not yet been broken through for the time being.

Australia was originally a good destination for American automobiles, but recently it has reformed its tax rates and has strict restrictions on the import of American automobile bodies, and the situation is tense. It seems that in the near future, restrictions will also be imposed on chassis. This condition is most unfavorable for independent automobile factories. As for Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler, because they either have their own factories in Australia or have contracts with local factories, there will be no problems.

Regarding Asia, China and India originally sold a considerable number of American automobiles. The sales in China have not been bad recently. Because many new roads have been built in India, the number of exports in the future will definitely increase.

Many countries south of the United States are giving American automobiles a good opportunity for foreign sales. The United States has established reciprocal commercial agreements with Cuba, Colombia, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Brazil, all of which can greatly promote the foreign sales of American cars.

Since American automobiles changed to launching new cars in the autumn, it has greatly benefited the automobile export industry. American car dealers can use this to compete with French or British automobiles.

In the countries of the Southern Hemisphere, people buy new cars at the beginning of spring and summer, because the seasons there are the opposite of those in the United States. What should be noted here is that last year, half of the American automobiles were exported to countries south of the equator.

The products of American automobile factories have all achieved good export industries. Last year, General Motors and Chrysler were especially outstanding. General Motors' new factories in Linthai and New Jersey will use some of their strength to specialize in Buick, Waltersmobiel, and Bintak cars for foreign sales. In the two months of September and October last year, Parker transported 1,200 exported automobiles, while in the same period the year before last, it was only 399 vehicles. In addition to this, the factory also has many orders in the process of being rushed to completion.

### Increased Production of Willys-Overland Small Cars

In recent years, the increase in gasoline prices has created a new outlet for small cars. Small cars are convenient to drive and can save on gasoline consumption. The "Fiat 500" car produced in Italy, Europe, has already become popular everywhere, and in the United States, the "Willys-Overland" small car is the most popular. Therefore, the production volume has increased sharply. According to the recent announcement by Mr. David Willys, General Manager of the factory, from November 30 last year to February 15 this year, the factory has produced as many as 15,169 vehicles. In particular, in the last half month, from January 1 to 15, it produced 4,561 vehicles, an increase of 51% compared to the first fifteen days of January this year, which produced 1,551 vehicles. All of these products have been sold in various states in the United States. Because its price is cheaper than other cars, and its installment payments are especially cheap, it is extremely popular among the local people. Each gallon of gasoline can provide 35 miles of travel, which can be said to be cheap and high-quality. The first batch of new cars will arrive in Shanghai soon. At that time, they will definitely shine in Shanghai. It is conceivable that the people of Shanghai will rush to buy them, and the grand occasion can be predicted.

### The All-Steel Body Feature of the New Ford V8 Car

The largest steel stamping ever used in Ford automobile manufacturing forms the top of the body of all 1937 Ford V8 sedan bodies.

This brand new Ford V8 body is purely made of steel. All frame structures, floorboards, and panels are also made of steel, not just the roof. This is the biggest advancement in body design since Ford adopted steel bodies a few years ago.

The huge steel roof starts from the front windshield and extends to the bottom of the rear window, reaching the top of the doors and the edges of the panels on both sides. It is made in one go and is electrically forged to connect it with the internal steel panels and steel floorboards of the body structure to form a giant body that is strong, powerful, and accurate, maximizing the protective power of the car body.

No wood is used in any part of the body structure. Even where decorations are nailed, wood is not used, but special nailing materials are used instead.

### An Overview of the American Automobile Industry in the Past Year

— Ying

Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, the year 1936 is about to pass completely. Therefore, at this time of the year-end, the results of the automobile industry in European and American countries this year can be generally seen. What I want to tell the readers here is an overview of the American automobile industry in the past year.

In the most recent year, when it comes to the American automobile industry, there has been considerable prosperity. Just in terms of commercial vehicles and trucks, the sales of each factory, it is said, have never had such a record since the beginning of the recession. The sales of trucks this year have even exceeded the figures of the heyday of 1929. In short, such high sales of trucks have never occurred in the history of the American automobile industry. According to what the American automobile industry had previously predicted, the registration number of new trucks in 1936 could reach 600,000 vehicles, but in 1929 it was only 527,057 vehicles. The high number of truck sales is not an accident, because the beginning of 1936 had a special boom in sales, and it was already expected that this year would create a record high. Moreover, in terms of this autumn, the products of each factory could not even meet the needs of the car dealers, because most of the car dealers at that time had no inventory left. As a result, some car dealers stopped competing with their peers for a while because they lacked trucks to sell.

Among the trucks produced by American factories, there are two types of customers who have increased particularly - farmers and construction companies. Just in terms of farmers, it is said that this year, among the trucks sold by each factory, more than one in four were purchased by farmers. Since the beginning of the recession, the worst years, it can be said that farmers did not buy trucks at all. Although a small number of farmers in some places still bought towing vehicles, most of the factories said that customers, especially farmers, had been greatly affected due to the drought and were almost completely extinct. But the situation is different this year. The trucks of each factory have made rapid progress, and farmers also occupy a considerable proportion of the customers. The main reason is that the selling prices of agricultural products have increased. In some places, this year is even a bumper harvest. Therefore, the purchasing power of farmers has also increased a lot. The rapid development of the construction industry has of course also led to an increase in truck sales. Construction companies mostly buy trucks to transport materials in order to complete the contracts as soon as possible. Even merchants who operate transportation businesses are willing to spend more money to buy a truck to transport goods for the sake of speed and convenience. Even those who operate transportation businesses have replaced small cars with trucks in order to reduce transportation costs. Therefore, each automobile factory has always expressed optimism about the automobile industry this year. (To be continued)

### Car Counter

When a car is driving on the highway, it is not easy to record and calculate the number of cars that pass by in a specified time. Someone in the United States has now invented such a machine that can record the number of vehicles passing by in a specified time, and also record the date, time, and minutes. In addition, it can also record the sum of the total number of vehicles within each hour, including the time. This machine is created using the principle of electric eyes.

The inventor of this machine is the Commercial Machines Company of New York City, USA. The manufacturing principle includes two major parts. One part includes a photographic vacuum tube and two photographic lenses. The other part is two light source machines placed opposite each other on the side of the road. The infrared filter allows the light to be invisible to the naked eye, so car drivers will not be bothered by the glare of the light. In addition to cars, pedestrians walking through the light do not have a counting effect. The American Highway Authority has adopted this machine to calculate the number of vehicles passing by on the road.
