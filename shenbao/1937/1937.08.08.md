### Japan Does Not Abandon Concessions

Administrative Transfer is a Temporary Measure; It Will be Abolished After the North China Incident is Resolved

[Hankou] The Chinese authorities here have taken over the administration of the Japanese concession. However, Japanese sailors are still guarding it fully armed. It is said that this transfer of administration is only a temporary measure and that it will be abolished after the North China "Incident" is resolved. Therefore, the impression of some that Japan has abandoned the Japanese concession in Hankou is actually inaccurate. This afternoon, a Reuters reporter entered the Japanese concession for inspection. When entering the concession, he was stopped by Japanese soldiers with bayonets and ordered to halt. However, after explanation, he was allowed to pass. The situation within the concession is still peaceful. However, transport vehicles are fully loaded with furniture and belongings, and the traffic is very busy. Other than those moving furniture, there are no other pedestrians on the road. The tension between China and Japan is evident in the suspension of all business and the cancellation of all contracts.

### Joint Statement by Shanghai Japanese Officials

In Accordance with the Government's Policy of Non-Expansion, Orders to Withdraw to Avoid Incidents

(Local News) The Japanese authorities in Shanghai have made the following statement regarding the withdrawal of Japanese expatriates from Hankou: Since the outbreak of the North China Incident, the situation in Hankou has become increasingly tense. Our acting Consul-General in Hankou requested instructions from the home government. In view of the overall situation between Japan and China and adhering to the government's policy of not expanding the situation, orders were given to withdraw all expatriates in order to avoid incidents. However, the Consul in Hankou is to consult with local Chinese officials to find ways to protect the concession and other national and public property, as well as the private property of expatriates. Because of this necessity, he was ordered to remain in the area temporarily. In addition, the Embassy in China and the Consul-General in Hankou have separately requested assistance from Nanjing and local officials. The entire withdrawal of Japanese expatriates from Hankou will be the first step. Therefore, there are various speculations about the aftermath of the Japanese concession. However, as in the case of Chongqing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places with Japanese concessions, Chinese officials were requested to fully protect the concessions when Japanese expatriates withdrew. Therefore, the preservation of the Japanese concession in Hankou should be considered unproblematic. (7th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

Although Liu was ill, his spirit was very good. After getting off the plane, he shook hands with each of the welcomers to express his thanks and then boarded a car to the Beijing office of the Sichuan-Kangding Pacification Headquarters to rest. At 6 PM, he paid his respects to Chairman Chiang to report on everything. At the airport, he issued a written statement to reporters as follows: This time, I am entering Beijing despite my illness with the aim of paying my respects to Chairman Chiang and the central government authorities, reporting on the implementation of military reorganization, and requesting instructions on all matters related to rear defense during the national crisis. Recently, the national crisis has become serious and has reached the final juncture. A full-scale war of resistance is inevitable. Planning countermeasures is the prerogative of the central government. In addition to respectfully listening to the instructions of Chairman Chiang and the heads of the central government, I will also contribute as much as possible any insights I may have for their adoption. The nation and the race have reached the final juncture, and the only way out is resistance. The national people are full of enthusiasm and have fully demonstrated the spirit of unity and common dedication to the national crisis. Adversity and the country are about to be clearly verified. Although the enemy is strong and violent, we will strive for the final victory. Sichuan is the rear defense of the country, and Sichuan Province will bear a great responsibility in the future. At present, the reorganization of the army has been completed, and manpower and financial resources can all be contributed to the country. My personal intention in coming here is to make this clear, to make all preparations under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, to relieve the central government's worries, and to comfort the hopes of the people. However, Sichuan and Kangding have just gotten on track, and the construction of various projects has just been planned, and the foundation is not yet solid. In terms of resources, there is much that needs to be done in terms of personnel. Since the people of the country have recognized the importance of rear defense, it is earnestly hoped that everyone will work together to assist. In particular, it is hoped that the financial community will concentrate resources on production and development to replenish material resources so that Sichuan can truly be the shield for the nation's struggle. Then the country and the local area will be fortunate. Because my responsibilities are very heavy, I do not dare to cherish my sick body and am entering Beijing to ask for instructions. I am honored to have your visit and welcome, which I do not dare to accept. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)

After arriving at the airport, he exchanged pleasantries with the well-wishers and discussed the issue of military reorganization with the three army commanders, Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, and Wang Zanshu. It was generally agreed that the first step in military reorganization had been completed, and the list of unit designations would be announced on the 10th, instructing Tang Shizun and others to implement it accordingly. According to Liu's remarks before his departure, this time, he is entering Beijing despite his illness to request instructions, which is of great importance. If he has any insights, he should contribute them to the central government for their adoption. In recent years, the national crisis has become increasingly serious, and the supreme leader has always given clear instructions on the great righteousness of resisting aggression and dying for the country. Having been in the military for a long time, I believe that in today's situation, there is no other way than resistance. Sichuan is a key rear defense area, and in the long-term war of resistance in the future, Sichuan should bear the heavy responsibility of long-term support. All manpower and material resources can be contributed to the country. This time, I plan to express this intention sincerely. Despite my sick body and the hot weather, I am traveling quickly, and I am extremely grateful for the enthusiastic farewell from all walks of life. The patriotism and anti-Japanese enthusiasm of colleagues and the public will definitely be relayed to the central government, and I will definitely not disappoint expectations.

### Shen Junru and Others Visit Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan

Discussing National Salvation Policies with Feng and Yan; Shen and Others Arrive in Shanghai by Night Train

[Nanjing] Shen Junru and others had previously met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. On the morning of the 7th, at 6:00 AM, they met with Vice Chairman Feng Yuxiang to discuss national salvation policies. Feng also invited them to breakfast. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Shen and others met with Vice Chairman Yan Xishan and had extensive discussions. It is reported that Shen Junru, Li Gongpu, and Zhang Naiqi took the night train back to Shanghai on the 7th and will return to Nanjing on the morning of the 9th. Chairman Chiang plans to meet with all seven members of Shen's group for a second time on the 9th or 10th, following his previous conversation with Shen Junru alone. (7th Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Shen Junru, Li Gongpu, and Zhang Naiqi took the night train to Shanghai on the 7th, leaving Zou Taofen, Wang Zao Shi, Sha Qianli, and Shi Liang in Nanjing to continue meeting and talking with various authorities. Shen and others expressed that they were deeply moved by Mr. Chiang's Lushan speech while in prison and immediately sent a telegram expressing their enthusiasm. After being released from prison, they came to Nanjing to meet with party, government, and military authorities. Everyone expressed complete agreement on the determination to resist Japan. As for the strategic grasp of time and space, it should be the government's responsibility to make the most appropriate design. Furthermore, the leaders of the party, government, and military have expressed that they will address domestic issues with generosity, kindness, frankness, and directness, which aligns with the hopes of the national public. It can be said that the leadership and the people are of one mind. It is deeply believed that party and government workers in various regions will be able to uphold this spirit, actively lead the people, so that every patriotic person can contribute their sincerity and make the greatest effort for the country, to build a people's bulwark as strong as steel, to guarantee the final victory of the national war. At present, the people's work should be unified under unified leadership and should be more specific and more composed. This is undoubtedly not a problem, but it must be demonstrated concretely and calmly under national mobilization and in active action. Therefore, speaking of unified leadership, it cannot rely solely on a few documents and a few organizations, but requires widespread and deep mobilization. Speaking of composure, it is definitely not inaction or depression, but rather planned and methodical action. Patriotic sincerity is common to all. Currently, in every alley, in every corner of the house, in every village boat, there are people who are enthusiastic about saving the country but lack the means. This is a source of suffering and grief for the people and a great loss for the country. Mobilizing them is currently an extremely arduous task. It is hoped that the leaders will make efforts. Finally, regarding the meaning of the word "composure," we believe that it is essential that, today, when the government has expressed its great determination, we, the people, must conduct careful reviews and practical efforts on how to contribute ourselves and on individual issues of future mobilization. As for the war process, we should of course think hard everywhere, but we must absolutely not be afraid of losing battles. Winning requires continued fighting, and losing also requires continued fighting. Only then can we achieve final victory. Therefore, the people must not be overly concerned with temporary victories or accidental gains and losses in the war, but only remember the three words "fight to the end." Soldiers should be rewarded for winning battles, and especially need to be comforted for losing battles. Whoever can fight to the end is a national hero and should not be despised for a temporary defeat but should have their achievements calculated on the day of final victory. This is what we want to say today. (7th Special Dispatch)

Travel Correspondence

### En Route Northward

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Ximin

At 11:30 PM on July 31st, I, the reporter, took a rickshaw from my residence in Shanghai, passing through the dazzling neon lights, and rows of cars silently waiting along the roadside for their owners who were reveling in the dance halls. In the vicinity of the Racecourse, I quietly boarded the Shanghai-Peiping through train northward.

Arriving at the ticket counter, I inquired about the fare and sleeper to Zhengzhou via the Longhai Railway from Xuzhou. A middle-aged passenger squeezed in beside me and asked the ticket clerk where the Shanghai-Peiping through train went. The ticket clerk replied, "Jinan." "Jinan! Wasn't it still going to Cangzhou yesterday? Why has the route been shortened so quickly?" In surprise, I couldn't help but blurt out these words. The thin ticket clerk sitting at the ticket counter glanced at me without saying a word, only shaking his head. The expression on his face was filled with deep melancholy! My heart was completely moved by his sorrowful emotions. But what stirred in my heart was not passive sorrow, but a full surge of grief and courage.

The locomotive of the Shanghai-Peiping train emitted a long roar, and the train began to crawl forward. With a surge of heroic passion, I allowed the train to carry me away, racing through the dark and silent wilderness. A second-class compartment that could accommodate four passengers contained only me. Loneliness tightly surrounded me. Fortunately, I was tired after a long day, and I fell into a daze after the train arrived in Kunshan.

The next day, I woke up to broad daylight. Looking out of the train window, I saw the beautiful and majestic scenery of Qixia Mountain flashing by. It turned out that the train was approaching Nanjing. I yawned and stared intently at the peaks of Qixia Mountain flashing past, my heart filled with many emotions. I couldn't help but pray silently: "Qixia Mountain! I hope you are an iron wall defending the capital, blocking the Hu barbarians from invading the Yangtze River!"

When the train arrived in Xiaguan, there were not many passengers getting on or off. I still occupied a compartment by myself. I bought a copy of the Central Daily News from a newspaper vendor. The large headlines of the Japanese bombing of Tianjin and Baoding, with extremely heavy casualties, pierced my eyes. As I read Chairman Wang Jingwei's speech in Lushan, sentence by sentence, I came to the section on national unity and sacrifice, leaving not a single puppet seed. At that moment, the train had just entered the Yangtze River ferry, preparing to cross the river. In the past, before the ferries were added, crossing the river was an extremely troublesome matter for travelers. Now, of course, it is much more convenient, but the time delay cannot be compared to having a railway bridge. As the train was carried by the ferry in the middle of the river, I looked at the surrounding river water and the scenery on both banks, and suddenly, these two questions popped into my mind. If a large-scale war between China and Japan officially breaks out, with the enemy's strong air force, it would probably be easy to destroy our country's railway transportation. At that time, I'm afraid the Yangtze River ferry wouldn't be as stable as it is today, able to provide connecting transportation between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. This is not unfounded anxiety. Given that the enemy is scheming to exploit us in every way possible, it is very likely. For the sake of convenience and security of military transportation, the government authorities should have contingency measures prepared early on.

At this time, my thoughts extended to another point. In a backward country like ours, not only could important railway communications be destroyed by the enemy, but all large and small cities across the country could be reduced to ashes in enemy bombing. But this has no decisive significance for our nation's war of survival. The enemy's destruction can only prevent us from quickly connecting the front and rear, and difficulties will arise in the supply of various materials. This can only prevent us from quickly exerting our resistance against the enemy, but it can never stop or dissolve our determination and will to resist. As long as 'unified sacrifice' and 'scorched earth resistance' can be maintained for a long time, we will suffer great losses, but the enemy will similarly suffer losses that outweigh their gains. Therefore, as long as our entire nation fights unremittingly, we may not be able to defeat the enemy, but we have the final certainty of repelling the enemy and driving them out of our borders!

After crossing the river, the train headed north. Sitting alone in the car, I turned to the "History of the Song Dynasty" for entertainment. The History of the Song Dynasty is the most tragic and hateful scene in the history of the demise of the Han Chinese, so people of ardent blood have a psychological aversion to reading it. Indeed, under a compromising "peace" character, Zhao's dynasty was unknowingly ruined, and the most despicable stain was left behind for thousands of years. Today, the enemy's piecemeal encroachment on North China and the traitors' denial of their ancestors, if it were not separated by nearly a thousand years, would really be considered a remake of the history of the Northern Song Dynasty. For example, the enemies who invaded North China and attacked Peiping and Tianjin, repeatedly whitewashed their aggression as "self-defense actions," and because they could not swallow North China in one gulp, they used traitorous organizations like the Maintenance Association to temporarily maintain the situation, slowly chewing it into their stomach, and even declaring on the surface with great fanfare that they "do not seek territory." This kind of strategy is exactly the same as when the Jin people besieged Bianliang, falsely claiming to "condemn the guilty and comfort the people," using traitors like Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu, and conferring them as Emperors of Chu and Emperors of Qi, allowing the traitors to nominally rule the area south of the Yellow River while boasting that they are not greedy for land. When Bianliang was besieged, the court was undecided on war and peace, leading to opening the gates to welcome the enemy, and the two emperors were captured. This situation, comparing it to recent events, is truly vivid and lifelike, as if it were right before our eyes. The demise of the Northern Song Dynasty cannot be entirely blamed on the strength of the Jin people's army. Today, the crisis in North China is also due to the lack of ambition of our own descendants!

History will not repeat itself. The Liao and Jin people's invasion of the Song Dynasty and the 20th-century imperialist invasion of China are fundamentally different in nature. We, the compatriots who have endured the enemy's aggression for six years, can only hope that history will not repeat itself. I cannot bear to see the demise of the country like the Southern Song Dynasty in the era of partial peace in Jiangzuo.

Endless reveries continued until the train pulled into Bengbu, where I was interrupted by the chaotic voices of the passengers. There were many soldiers with guns patrolling on the platform, and the atmosphere was somewhat different from the areas we had passed through. Many people got on the train, and it suddenly became lively again. The train arrived in Xuzhou at exactly 5:30 PM. Xuzhou is the intersection of the Longhai and Jinpu Railways, and like Zhengzhou, it is an important rear base for military affairs today. The solemn atmosphere at the station was even more intense than in Bengbu. Many ambulances were being unloaded from freight cars. There were also several rows of northward-bound iron-covered cars lying quietly in the passageway. The military police's inspection at the station was also extremely serious. I looked at the train schedule and saw that the Longhai train would not depart until 6:30 PM, so I had an hour to go out of the station and hastily ate something at a nearby small restaurant before getting on the Longhai train.

Since the Japanese army provoked in North China, the number of passengers on the northbound Jinpu Line has gradually decreased, while the southbound lanes are packed with compatriots seeking refuge every day. A Xuzhou newspaper headline read: 'Luggage desolate, crossing the river south; heartbreakingly looking north, there is no home.' How desolate! The situation in the second-class carriage of the Longhai Line was very different from the northbound train of the Jinpu Line. Half of the small carriage was filled with women, children, and soldiers. The crying of children and the smell of feces and urine filled the air, but I didn't feel disgusted or embarrassed at all, because these are the wives and children of the soldiers defending the country! There were too many women and children, and there were no seats. The soldier husbands who were escorting them to the station were sweating profusely, carrying things and looking for seats. A middle-aged passenger with a Hebei accent said to another companion who was occupying a seat in a very loud voice: 'Old fellow! Stand up and let them sit! Anyway, we are all Chinese. They are the family members of soldiers. They are going to fight the enemy! Give them your seat!' The soldiers are all going to the front lines of the war of resistance with generosity. What a tragic scene it is to send their wives and children home!

Traveling west from Xuzhou, the sky gradually darkened, and the surrounding scenery could not be seen. But rows of exciting troop trains passed by the train window from time to time! When the train arrived in Zhengzhou, the Zhengzhou station was just as tense and with just as many vehicles. A glorious confidence occupied my heart: China will never become the Southern Song Dynasty! China is about to roar! The goal of the Chinese national warriors is not to cross the river south, but to point north!

Current Commentary

### The Future of the War of Resistance

— Yi

Only through a glorious national liberation war can our Chinese nation survive. This is already a consensus among the people from top to bottom.

Therefore, as soon as the sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge was heard, the call for resistance resounded throughout the country. We are not afraid of the enemy's threats. We are not afraid of the enemy's attacks. All the enemy's ferocious and brutal methods will only make the unity and determination of the people across the country more consolidated and strengthened.

But today, after the defeat of the Pingjin War, we see that there are still some dark clouds appearing in the future of the War of Resistance. First, a certain friendly country that has helped our country's construction a lot in recent years, under the control of short-sighted politicians, is deeply afraid that the expansion of the war in the Far East will cause further damage to their commercial interests and does not hesitate to make shameful concessions to the aggressor and attempt to advise China to be patient temporarily. Second, there is still a group of pessimists among the Chinese people who are overly sensitive to the power of the enemy's mechanized troops from the Pingjin War and therefore sing the tune of "fighting will lead to destruction, and not fighting will also lead to destruction."

Regarding the first point, we believe that in this critical moment of survival, we should carefully use diplomatic functions. But our national policy cannot be easily changed due to the intentions of friendly countries. The international situation is clearly unfolding before us. Before China's comprehensive war of resistance, even the Soviet Union, which is most closely related to China's fate, cannot effectively assist China because it must consider its diplomatic relations in Europe. If a real all-out war of resistance is launched, then, except for the aggressor countries, the sympathy of the whole world will definitely be on our side. As long as we are unyielding, they will naturally do their best to help us.

Regarding the second point, we believe that under the current situation, the pessimistic psychology of all defeatists is the most undesirable. The Twenty-Ninth Army's defeat this time was due to the poisoning of some senior officers by this psychology, which led to them repeatedly falling into the enemy's trap. We must all have a firm confidence in order to win the final victory in the War of Resistance. Of course, this is not to say that we can ignore the enemy's military strength and rely solely on a surge of courage to rush forward recklessly. We know that although our army and air force are several times stronger than they were ten years ago, they are still inferior to the enemy in terms of modern weapons. We know that our preparations for war are not as adequate as the enemy's. Therefore, we also admit that we must be careful and prudent in the War of Resistance and decide on a strategy based on overall interests, and we should not act rashly and make unnecessary sacrifices. But we cannot fail to recognize that we are an oppressed nation. The tragic pain of the enemy's aggression over the past century has unified the entire nation's will to resist the enemy. This kind of iron will cannot be conquered by the enemy's planes and cannons. After the loss of the Northeast, the local volunteer army destroyed more than 100,000 of the Japanese army's strength. Recently, Zhang Qingyu's unit of the Tongzhou Security Force killed more than 200 enemy soldiers in one day under the enemy's nose. These are all clear examples. What our War of Resistance relies on now is this kind of strong national will. Even if our weapons are worse, even if our preparations for war are worse, as long as the will to resist the enemy does not slacken due to temporary setbacks, we will definitely achieve the final victory. Because in the war of resistance of the oppressed nations, as in the revolutionary war, the force that determines victory or defeat lies more on the people's side than on the army side. The replenishment of weapons and soldiers is very easy when the military and civilians are thoroughly united.

Now the whole country sees the loss of Pingjin, precisely because after the loss of the Northeast, we temporarily tolerated the aggressors. Everyone feels that if we tolerate it any further, the situation of partial peace will never be maintained. Therefore, under the leadership of the government, not only does the entire army and people present an unprecedented phenomenon of unity, but everyone has also made the greatest determination to resist the enemy and defend against insults. At this time, we hope that the government will quickly clear up those dark clouds that are affecting the mood of resistance and use the valuable lessons of the National Revolution to motivate the people, organize the people, and engage in a difficult and sustained struggle with the invading enemy.

### French Poet and Diplomat Writes Highly Praising Our Strong Resistance

Peiping Was Originally Our Political Center and Must Be Recovered The Japanese Army's Desire to Seize Economic Power Will Also Be Difficult to Achieve

[Paris] Claude, a French man of the times, former ambassador to Japan and the United States, and former staff member of the Chinese embassy, recently published an article in the right-wing Figaro newspaper, commenting on the Sino-Japanese dispute. Japan's approach to China is "using both military and political means" and wants to seize northern China before it stops. If we draw a straight line on the Asian continent, starting from northern China, there will be a day when we can follow this straight line from Tianjin through Mongolia to Siberia...As for the place of Peiping, politically speaking, it was originally the capital of China, and geographically speaking, it is located in a corner. It has been the political center of China for a long time. Although it has been moved several times in the past, it will eventually be able to restore its status as the capital. The intention of the invading country is to use this claimed position to better scheme'. It is as if those who claim hegemony in China will inevitably encounter great obstacles, especially since Chinese culture and spirit are uniformly aligned and cannot be broken. 'Japan will inevitably suffer invisible resistance, and to overcome this resistance, it will not be successful without extremely original forces and extremely large wars. Moreover, Japan's reliance on military superiority to monopolize China economically will inevitably be opposed by the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and all countries in the world. In short, anyone who has interacted with the Chinese people knows the Chinese people's sharp personality and their great passive resistance. In the future, if all countries in the world support them in unison, the strength of their resistance to aggression will be even more self-evident,' he said.

### Fuzhou Business Community's Anti-Smuggling Movement

All Businesses Given a Deadline to Eliminate Smuggled Goods; No More Smuggling After Elimination

Fuzhou Correspondence: Among the smuggled goods sold in the city's markets, the silk and cloth industry has the most, followed by the Jiangsu and Guangdong goods industry, and then the dried fruit industry. Most of these goods come from Taiwan and Hong Kong. The silk and cloth industry has publicly agreed to ban the sale of smuggled goods since July. The existing smuggled goods, worth about ten thousand yuan, have been gathered together and are being sold at discounted prices. They have now been eliminated. All silk and cloth shops have hung signs in their shops stating that they do not sell smuggled goods. The Jiangsu and Guangdong Goods Association also decided on July 37th to stop selling smuggled goods. However, due to the large variety and trivial nature of the goods in this industry, in order to thoroughly eliminate smuggling, a notice has been issued to all warehouses and shops to list and submit an evaluation form for all old smuggled goods, regardless of quantity, within seven days for registration, so that personnel can be dispatched to inspect and seal them, and then determine how to handle them. The dried fruit industry, seeing the silk and cloth industry implementing the elimination of smuggled goods and the Jiangsu and Guangdong goods industry starting to register smuggled goods, merchants in this industry did not want to be left behind and also gathered on the 2nd to discuss registering old smuggled goods in order to eliminate them within a deadline. In the future, direct purchasers will no longer purchase new smuggled goods, and retail stores will no longer sell new smuggled goods. Penalties have also been agreed upon. If direct purchasers purchase new smuggled goods in the future, they will be fined 500 yuan. Retail stores selling new smuggled goods will be fined 300 yuan. Rewards for informants will be 30%. The Steamship Association on the upper reaches of the Min River also held a meeting on the 2nd and decided to refuse to transport smuggled goods and printed slogans to be posted on various steamships to show their determination. It has been found that this anti-smuggling movement by various merchant guilds is completely voluntary. However, the Japanese consul in Fuzhou mistakenly believed that the merchants' refusal to sell smuggled goods was a boycott of Japanese goods and inquired with the provincial government about the situation. After the authorities explained, there were no further objections. (4th)

### Land Subsidence in Nanxia Sixing Port, Changshu County

Over Ten Thousand Mu of Fields Suddenly Become a Vast Ocean; Hundreds of Residents Drowned

Changshu Correspondence: A hurricane struck here on the 4th, and all rural telephone lines were cut, causing communication to be cut off. At noon on the 5th, the county government received a special report that the Nanxia West and Port area of Shazhou City was flooded by the hurricane tide and had subsided, inundating over 8,000 mu of land and drowning hundreds of nearby residents, resulting in losses of over 200,000 yuan, the worst in twenty years. (According to reports, the area was once attacked by river tides in June of the fourth year of the Republic, killing and injuring hundreds of farmers.) The Seventh District of Shazhou City was originally formed by sand beaches, which were enclosed to become land. It has only been two hundred years. Every time a hurricane arises, the dikes in this area are at risk. This hurricane struck on the night of the 2nd, and on the night of the 3rd, the situation was even worse. At about 11 pm on the night of the 3rd, heavy rain was added, and the river tide increased sharply, landing ashore and attacking the Nanxia area of Sixing Port. The waves surged and suddenly rose to a height of over ten feet. After rushing in through a large breach, residents were caught in their sleep without being able to escape when attacked from inside and outside. The number of drowned people reached hundreds. Houses and livestock were swept away by the waves. Upon hearing the news, Nanfeng Town, five miles away from the riverbank, immediately gathered the crowd in the middle of the night amidst strong winds and heavy rain and set up ways to rescue them. After mobilizing everyone, sandbags were used to block and defend, temporarily preserving peace. However, in the Sixing Port Nanxia Changtong Port area, more than 8,000 mu of land have been occupied. On the morning of the 5th, more than 60 bodies were found near Nanfeng Town, the most tragic being the Cai Jingxiu family of ten farmers who were all drowned. At this moment, bodies and miscellaneous utensils are still floating along the beach, and the town mayor and others are salvaging them. District Chief Liu Jianbai happened to be in the city on official business. Upon hearing the shocking news, he rushed back to his hometown to investigate and handle the aftermath, intending to take two steps. First, he will report the details of the disaster to the county government and request relief. In terms of personnel, it is necessary to wait for the water to recede before finding ways to collect the corpses and repair the dikes. (6th) Another dispatch: When the typhoon passed through, the river tide in Shazhou City, Sixing Port, and Nanfeng Town along the river in this county was affected by the hurricane and suddenly landed, with the water level rising to more than ten feet, causing hundreds of nearby residents to drown. The situation is very tragic. The Shazhou telephone has not yet been restored, and the details are still difficult to confirm, but as the water recedes, more than ninety corpses have been found and are being collected after being examined by the court. As for the losses this time, it is estimated that dozens of new and old dikes were destroyed, occupying about 3,000 mu of land, and the fields are full of soybeans, cotton, and other crops. All of these were destroyed this time. According to the statistics of the Shatian Company, the loss is more than 800,000 yuan. In addition, the Xinli, Houde, and Dingfeng three reclamation companies have built new dikes this year, and the project cost alone has been around 200,000 yuan. In addition, there are houses, livestock, etc., all of which were destroyed, and the losses are also quite considerable. Therefore, the total loss this time should be more than one million yuan. This year's sandy land cotton has been affected, and it is difficult to recover from this damage for a while.

Four Chinese Traitors Captured in Ben Niu

Pan Bingshu and other road protection police officers from the Ben Niu Town sub-station in Wujin County were patrolling near Ben Niu Railway Station in the late night of the 5th when they caught sight of four suspicious people. They saw them doing something on the tracks, and immediately moved forward to arrest them without making a sound. All four were captured. Upon searching them, they found a piece of paper with the words "Three Steps Two Bridges," five large and small photographs, a handful of soybeans, and a postal registered receipt. The traitors' attitude was extremely tough. The precinct judge held a preliminary hearing. According to their confession, they were named Zhang Yisheng, Chen Yusheng, Ge Hongkui, and Shen Changsheng. They had previously served as soldiers and had been out of work for a long time. The rest of their statements were evasive.

He first went to the Construction Section of this county to inquire about the cause of the disputes, and then went to the power plant outside the North Gate to talk to the workers separately. The previous night, the company's water pump suddenly encountered obstacles, and some of the machines could not be started, causing a power outage for three or four hours, which was suspected of being caused by sabotage. Commissioner Chen believed that this matter was related to local security and ordered the chief engineer of the plant to be responsible for handling it and to strictly prepare the power plant to prevent accidents. He stayed at the Central Hotel that night. He heard that on the morning of the 5th, he went to the company's Shouxian Bridge to check the accounts.

Rivers Huai, Yi, and Shu Suddenly Rise

The Huai, Yi, and Shu rivers, which pass through various counties in northern Jiangsu, rose sharply by three to four meters starting at noon on the 3rd. The Shu River, Chaimi, and Liutang three rivers in Shuyi County have already reached the flood stage. The water level in the Shiji area of Siyang, which is subject to the flow of the Yi River from the Central Canal, has also risen sharply by about four meters.

County Magistrate Requests Relief for Collapsing Riverbank

The riverbanks along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, such as Liuyu in Guazhou, have repeatedly collapsed during the high flood season, inundating a large amount of fertile land over the years. The county magistrate of this county, Ma Zhenbang, believes that the Liuyu Riverbank is an important gateway for passengers traveling to and from Zhenjiang by car, and is of great importance to the safety of travelers. Therefore, after the Jiangkou collapsed by many zhang a month ago, he telegraphed the National Economic Commission and the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, appealing for rapid relief to protect the lives and fields of the coastal areas. It is learned that the above two institutions have replied to Yangzhou, stating that they will plan and implement it as soon as the research is completed.

Flood Relief in the Second and Third Districts

The Juban Township Zhongxing Town area in the third district of Jiangdu suffered a dike breach due to continuous wind and heavy rain, which caused the Yangtze River tide to surge. It was late at night, and residents who were sleeping were unable to escape and were swept away. It is estimated that the flooded area is three to four thousand mu, and most of the houses, livestock, and rations were swept away by the waves. The victims have now moved to higher ground and are crying for food. Township Chief Wang Zhongshi, in addition to rushing to handle temporary emergency accounts, has also surveyed the disaster situation and reported to the district to request County Magistrate Ma to find a way to provide relief. In addition, the banks of Tianchengzhou and Dunzizhou Nian three dikes have all broken, and the disaster situation is also tragic. The local Jiangfang Office has received orders from Fangxun Commissioner County Magistrate Ma by Jianju Affairs Section Chief Cao Rufu and technician Li Guishen to go to the second and third districts to work with local people to prevent and rescue. On the evening of the 5th, they first received 100 yuan in rescue funds, purchased 580 sacks and other rescue tools, and rushed to prevent and rescue.

Women's Association Telegraphed to Comfort Anti-Aggression Troops

### Yuyao

Abandonment Case Released on Bail Pending Trial

Chen Bo-ying, a Yuyao native, once served as a professor at Jinling University. He was previously accused of abandonment for seducing female student Lu Yunzhen and failed to appear in court despite repeated summons. Chen was recently arrested by a bailiff in Zhouxing. The case was publicly heard on the morning of the 5th, and the audience was extremely crowded. Chen confessed that due to a momentary lapse of judgment, he forgot the teacher-student relationship. After cohabitation, he regularly remitted money for support and did not abandon her. He couldn't help but cry in court when the woman ungratefully filed a lawsuit. The hearing continued in the afternoon. The court investigated the remittance evidence before a retrial. Chen was released on bail with 700 yuan in cash.

Yongping Ship Capsizes Carelessly

More than 30 soldiers from a certain battalion stationed in Changxing took the Yongping gasoline ship of the Yuantong Shipping Bureau from Shan Chang to Lake at about 7:00 am on the 6th. At about 10:00 am, when sailing to the Yixi Bridge outside the South Gate of this city, the ship was washed away by the water current when it just came out of the bridge hole due to the fast flow of water and the helmsman was careless, causing the ship to capsize. Later, it rushed to the opposite side of the Hehe Beach. More than 20 soldiers and crew members escaped by swimming, and the rest broke through the bottom of the ship to rescue themselves.

Kong recently gave an interview to a Havas reporter, saying: "Prime Minister Xu Dan of your country and Ambassador Julieitt of the United States have both expressed sympathetic understanding to me, which is gratifying. Now I must visit your country's Finance Minister Ponglai and leave Paris on the evening of the 8th of this month. According to French sources, Deputy Prime Minister Kong recently negotiated in London in principle to issue foreign bonds of £20 million with Chinese customs revenue as collateral to exchange Chinese domestic bonds. France and the United States immediately agreed to have banks in the two countries subscribe to these bonds. At present, Kong is deeply concerned that banks in these countries may change their original intentions due to the events in the Far East, so he has come here to explain China's prospects to French Prime Minister Xu Dan and U.S. Ambassador Berleitt, so that they can rest assured, and so that future bond subscribers can also rest assured. Deputy Prime Minister Kong also stated that he believes that this effort will be completely successful." (6th Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

This is truly a cause for national celebration. This Diet unexpectedly had to submit a huge additional budget and special tax bill due to the North China Incident, and all the members were able to recognize the current major situation and promote the achievement of national unity, which is truly inspiring. The proposals and budget bills that have been supported by this Diet should be implemented in a suitable and effective manner, which goes without saying. In particular, the resolution on the North China Incident, which was approved by the House of Representatives yesterday to ensure eternal peace in East Asia, is truly a voice representing the will of the people of the whole country. The government will not fail to meet expectations and will handle the future situation with full determination and effort to live up to the expectations. Today's situation is extremely serious. In the future, I am willing to exert all my efforts with the people of the whole country to cope with the situation. This is what I am aware of." (7th Allied Telegram)

### Japan-Russia Relations

Sakhalin Oil Mines; Another Dispute Arises

[Moscow] After the robbery of the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin, a dispute arose between Japan and Russia over the Sakhalin oil mines, causing the relations between the two groups to become more tense. Regarding this matter, the Soviet government's organ newspaper News has recently published an article entitled "The Arrogant Behavior of the Japanese," stating: "The Sakhalin Japanese Petroleum Company recently decided to build an oil pipeline in the Gadangglei area of northeastern Sakhalin to the coast, saying that the Concession General Office under the Soviet People's Committee was slow to approve it and could not wait. This matter was known to the Soviet government, which considered it a serious violation of the concession contract, and immediately ordered the Sakhalin authorities to prohibit it. In addition, well-informed sources in Sukyo also said, "The Japanese company has repeatedly violated the concession contract this year. The Soviet government is now taking all necessary measures to urge it to abide by the contract and Soviet law." (6th Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

### U.S.-Russia Trade Agreement

Agreed to Extend for One Year

[Washington] President Roosevelt announced today that the U.S.-Russia Special Commercial Agreement has now been decided to be extended for one year, but the minimum amount of goods purchased by Soviet Russia from the United States should be increased from 10 million yuan last year to 40 million yuan. The United States will grant Soviet Russia reciprocal trade rights. According to the State Department, the United States purchased approximately 37 million yuan of U.S. goods last year. (6th National Telegram)

[Moscow] The U.S.-Soviet Trade Treaty was exchanged on August 4 by Foreign Minister Litvinov and U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Davis. The document stipulates that the export of Soviet goods to the United States and the import of American goods to the Soviet Union should be treated with unconditional and unrestricted most-favored-nation status. This exchange of documents was approved and announced by the Soviet People's Committee and U.S. President Roosevelt on the 6th and took effect immediately. (6th Tass Telegram)

### The Time for British-Italian Negotiations is Ripe

To Be Held in Rome in September

[London] The time for British-Italian diplomatic talks is ripe and will begin in Rome at the end of September. The British side will be represented by Sir Drummond, the British Ambassador to Italy. (7th Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)

[Rome] The British Ambassador, Sir Drummond, set off for home at 11:00 am today for a holiday. (7th Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

[Rome] It is said that the United Kingdom and Italy have already reached a general understanding, so the British-Italian negotiations seem likely to reopen next week. At that time, the British Ambassador to Italy will have returned to London to discuss with the British Foreign Office, while the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom will also return to his country for the same purpose. However, well-informed sources here still hold the view that the easing of British-Italian tension is only psychological in nature. A considerable amount of time must pass before an agreement is reached. The general view is that the negotiations will not be concluded by the time of the next League of Nations meeting. (7th National Haitong Telegram)

[Paris] Regarding the good news that the United Kingdom and Italy have released their suspicions, the left-wing "Paris Echo" recently commented: "There is one thing to be noted here, that is, the Italian Ambassador Cerutti visited the French Prime Minister Xu Dan and told him that after the United Kingdom and Italy approached, France and Italy would also approach. Regarding this point, we can declare one thing to Italy, that is, its goodwill will inevitably arouse the same reaction in our country, but there are several matters that must be clarified, namely: ㊀ The issue of the withdrawal of Italian troops stationed in the Spanish Balearic Islands, ㊁ The issue of freedom of transportation in the Mediterranean Sea for the United Kingdom and France, ㊂ The issue of the implementation of various clauses in the Treaty of Friendship between France and Italy signed in January 1935 regarding French Tunis. Regarding the Abyssinian issue, French Foreign Minister Talbos and British Foreign Secretary Eden failed to persuade the countries to recognize the Italian annexation last September, but this year they may try to have the League of Nations recognize the power of Abyssinian Emperor Selassie. Now that he no longer exists, he is not allowed to continue attending the conference. If the Italian government submits a motion at that time, requesting the conference to revoke the resolution announcing the Italian aggression on October 7, 1935, it will inevitably cause unlimited disputes."

### Expansion of the Military Medical System in Japan

### Palestinian Partition Issue

Jewish National Congress: No Resolution Yet

⊙Zurich Today, during the Jewish program, the Zionist Congress has not held a meeting. The Congress has not yet reached a resolution on the partition plan for Palestine. Dr. Chaim Weizmann will go to Geneva at the end of the week to report to the League of Nations Mandate Commission on the sentiment of the majority of attendees at the Congress regarding the partition issue. According to Jewish Telegraphic Agency news, if the Congress delegates vote, approximately 75% will support the proposal passed yesterday by the Labor Group, authorizing the Executive Committee to negotiate with Britain regarding the partition proposal in order to comply with all resolutions. Zionist leader from America, Mr. Lipsky, stated that he believes the American delegation will vote in favor of Dr. Weizmann's resolution. He believes that only about 10% of the delegates support the extreme demand of rejecting partition in any form. Palestinian Labor leader Rubashov stated that the partition proposal contains the core of resolving the Jewish-Arab problem and it is now urgent to carefully study the Palestine Mandate Commission's recommendations. According to Weizmann's resolution, it authorizes the Executive Committee to negotiate with the British government regarding the partition issue, but only if the plan contains fundamental principles that allow Jews in Palestine to enjoy the life of an independent state as they envision, and thereby solve the Jewish problem in various countries. (Central News Agency, 6th Reuters dispatch)

⊙Zurich The Zionist Congress is continuing to convene here. Labor Party leader Le Mesurier of Palestine delivered his opinion, attacking the British Committee's proposal to divide Palestine into three zones, saying that it would reduce the rights that the Jewish people should enjoy under the mandate system and international obligations. Rubashov, the Labor Party leader of Tel Aviv, advocated accepting the British plan, saying that this may be the only opportunity to establish a Jewish state and should not be missed. Finally, Zionist leader Weizmann declared that the British plan must be improved, and most importantly, the Jewish people should have complete sovereignty over the Jewish part of the holy city of Jerusalem. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas dispatch)

[London] French Ambassador Corbin recently submitted a note regarding the Palestinian issue to the Foreign Office, which has now been forwarded to the Colonial Office for review. The French note expresses concern about several measures in the Palestine partition plan, believing that they could cause harm. One of the most opposed points is the report's suggestion to establish an Arab National Affairs Office in London and within Palestine to handle all matters related to the Arab people worldwide, similar to the existing Jewish Affairs Office. If this organization is established, agitators from French mandated territories, such as Syria and French territories in North Africa, may be accommodated within the office, thereby intensifying their activities and inevitably causing harm. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas dispatch)

[Geneva] The League of Nations Mandate Commission is continuing its meeting to discuss the Palestine issue. Mr. Hall, the representative of the British administrative authorities in Palestine, discussed the issue of foreign intervention in internal disputes in Palestine, which was raised by the Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Orts, yesterday. He said that after the conflicts between Jews and Arabs in Palestine last year, the authorities of various Arab countries came forward to mediate. Their motives were purely humanitarian, but Britain has not accepted any constraints on the solutions proposed by these parties. Its actions remain entirely independent. The issue of Palestine has exceeded the local scope in recent months, as can be seen in the note submitted by the government of Iraq. However, member states of the League of Nations often express opinions on issues that do not concern them, so Iraq's submission of a note is justified. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas dispatch)

### British Home Office Expels German Journalists

[London] Krom and Riedel, reporters for the Berlin 'Local Guide Newspaper' stationed in London, and Langen, a reporter for the Berlin 'Graver Newspaper', have been ordered by the British Home Office to be expelled from the country and must leave Britain within fifteen days. Regarding this matter, the Liberal Party's 'News Chronicle' reports that these individuals are being expelled on suspicion of espionage. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas dispatch)

[London] Regarding the expulsion of Krom and Riedel, reporters for the Berlin 'Local Guide Newspaper' stationed in London, and Langen, a reporter for the Berlin 'Graver Newspaper', the German Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Mr. Wallerman, is said to be preparing to lodge a protest with the British government in the near future. As for the reasons for the expulsion of these reporters, it is said that it was due to espionage activities. In reality, the main reason is that these reporters engaged in anti-British propaganda, especially the writings of Langen every week, which were the most intense. The British government once warned him. In 1935, Dr. Victor de, the London correspondent for the German Nazi Party's organ newspaper, the Attack Newspaper, and the People's Observer, applied to the British Home Office for renewal of his press credentials after his license expired. The department then refused on the grounds of violating public interest. The department's order yesterday to expel Krom and the other three is the second time it has imposed sanctions.

### Americans Enlisting in China

Suma Asks the U.S. to Pay Attention; Hull Says He Will Handle It According to Law

[Washington] Suma, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the United States, visited U.S. Secretary of State Hull today regarding the issue of Americans enlisting in China to participate in the anti-Japanese war, urging attention, but did not lodge a protest. Hull then announced to the press corps that the U.S. government will handle the matter of its citizens participating in foreign wars according to law. However, it is generally believed that this matter is difficult to prove, so reports are also uncommon. For example, many Americans enlisted in the Spanish Civil War, but none have been prosecuted by the authorities according to law. (6th National News dispatch)

[Washington] Foreign reports say that several thousand Americans have decided to enlist in the Chinese Air Force. The State Department has announced that it is unaware of this matter. Well-informed sources say that according to current U.S. law, Americans are not allowed to voluntarily enlist in foreign armies within the United States, but they are free to leave the country and go to China to enlist. Recently, Americans who volunteered to go to Spain have returned to the United States and have never been sentenced. This can be taken as clear evidence. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas dispatch)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull announced today that the law prohibiting Americans from enlisting in foreign countries will apply to the Sino-Japanese conflict. According to this law, violators will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years and fined $2,000. As far as the State Department is aware, the United States has never initiated a prosecution based on this law. If there is any action, it will be taken by the Department of Justice. This law has never been implemented for a hundred years. (Central News Agency, 6th Reuters dispatch)

[Washington] Senator Lewis today introduced a bill in the Senate to accelerate the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, asking Secretary of War Woodring to report to the Senate on the reasons why the U.S. 15th Infantry Regiment is still stationed in Tianjin. (6th National News dispatch)

### Spanish Rebel Aircraft Bomb British, French, and Italian Merchant Ships

Italian Captain Dies of Serious Injuries; Britain Lodges a Serious Protest

[London] The three aircraft that bombed merchant ships of Britain, France, Italy, and other countries off the coast of Algiers yesterday have been confirmed to be aircraft of the Spanish Nationalist forces. Britain has lodged a serious protest with the Nationalist authorities on Mallorca. At the same time, maritime powers have instructed their respective merchant ships not to enter the accident site without naval protection. Since this incident, the capitals of European countries have been shocked. The person who lodged a protest with the Spanish Nationalist forces today was Rear Admiral Wells, commander of the British Third Fleet. After the British, French, and Italian ships were attacked, it is said that the French suffered very minor losses. Nationalist aircraft made low-altitude flights and strafed downwards with machine guns. The ship's deck was hit by about a hundred bullets, but there were no deaths or injuries. However, the captain of the Italian ship Mongolia was seriously injured. The British ship also suffered only minor losses and there were no deaths or injuries. However, the attacking aircraft continuously attacked for an hour, dropping more than 40 bombs, none of which hit. They also strafed downwards with machine guns, and the ship was hit by many bullets. It was fortunate that it escaped danger. (Central News Agency, 7th Reuters dispatch)

⊙Algiers The captain of the Italian ship 'Mongolia', Mr. Solarari, who was seriously injured in the lungs during the attack in this port yesterday, has died. The Dutch inspector, Mr. Bairu Yi, who had a fractured arm, is not in serious condition. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas dispatch)

⊙Algeciras Three ships, one each from Britain, France, and Italy, were attacked yesterday in Spanish waters. Among them, the British cargo ship 'Cowper Lyle' was bombed by three aircraft 35 nautical miles outside this port, a total of 40 bombs were dropped, but none hit. The captain immediately ordered 'full sail', but the aircraft still flew at low altitude and strafed with machine guns for an hour. The Italian ship 'Mongolia' was hit by a bomb at 6:05 yesterday morning. A major, a Dutch inspector sent by the London Adjustment Committee, had his right arm broken. A crew member had his right lung punctured and has landed at the French port of Algiers and been sent to a hospital for treatment. In addition, the French cargo ship 'Jebé Yemou' was attacked by aircraft once five weeks ago. Yesterday, it was strafed by a single aircraft with machine guns, firing about a hundred bullets, none of which hit. Those that fell on the deck have been handed over to experts for inspection. After the news of the incident reached the port of Algiers, all parties were shocked. The Seamen's Union of the port declared that it would refuse to go to Spanish waters until the safety of the crew is guaranteed. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas dispatch)

### British Army Recruitment Below Target

Secretary of War Cancels Leave and Returns to London to Discuss Remedial Measures

[London] Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, who was on leave, has canceled his leave and hurriedly returned to London because the number of recruits for both the active army and the reserve army is below target. He is preparing to consult with senior army officers to find remedial measures. The current authorized strength of the active army and the reserve army is 112,000 less than in 1914. Looking only at the active army, 47,000 new soldiers need to be recruited this year to reach the target. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas dispatch)

### Spanish Problem Still Deadlocked

Russia, Germany, Italy, and Portugal Hold Opposing Views; Chairman Asks the Chief of Supervision to Report

[London] The effort to break the deadlock of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War has failed again. The subcommittee met for an hour today but failed to reconcile the differences between the Soviet Union and Italy and Germany. The committee must wait for its secretary to convene another meeting. Today, Lord Plymouth, seeing that no result could be obtained, announced the adjournment of the meeting. This move is intended to allow each committee member to calmly consult with their own government to determine whether a compromise can be reached, rather than admitting that another deadlock has occurred. At the same time, the technical committee will proceed with uncontroversial matters. Another technical committee has been formed to study land and sea supervision matters. During today's meeting, Soviet representative Maisky stated that the Soviet government cannot change its opinion expressed at the last meeting opposing the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist forces' right to belligerent status. The German representative asked to note that the German government is deeply concerned about the continuation of unilateral supervision, which obviously cannot continue for long. The chairman said that it would be more beneficial to consider the issue after the report from Major General Van Tume, the head of the land and sea supervision plan office, and Secretary Hemming on the investigation of supervision matters is submitted to the meeting, if it is necessary to consider the problem. He expressed sympathy. Maisky asked the German and Portuguese representatives whether they were prepared to declare their governments' unconditional agreement to the withdrawal of volunteers. The Soviet representative was not satisfied with the answers of the three countries' representatives. Maisky argued that the issue of volunteers is at the heart of the British plan. He must obtain an answer and also stated that the Soviet Union opposes granting belligerent rights, at least until after all volunteers have been withdrawn. Thereupon, the representatives of Germany, Italy, and Portugal all said that Maisky's remarks were irrelevant to the matter under discussion and outside the scope of the British plan, and that the three countries had accepted the British plan in principle, while the Soviet Union had not. Plymouth somewhat agreed with the representatives of Germany, Italy, and Portugal that what was being discussed was the British plan, not the Soviet plan for the withdrawal of volunteers, and proposed that the Land and Sea Supervision Plan Office should report on its inspection and put forward suggestions for restoring and improving the supervision plan, which was unanimously approved by the full meeting. Thereupon, the secretary of the office reported to the meeting that several governments had not yet paid the expenses that should be paid in accordance with the non-interference plan. The attending representatives promised to notify their respective governments of this matter and ask them to pay immediately. (Central News Agency, 6th Reuters dispatch)

### American Woman Gives Birth Post Mortem Via Surgery

Surprisingly Obtains a Lively Girl; Raises Legal and Ethical Issues

⊙Philadelphia, USA A bizarre birth case occurred here today. Doctors performed surgery on a woman after her death and surprisingly obtained a living infant. This has raised complex legal and ethical issues. A Mrs. Barkosheni, 27 years old, suffered from tuberculous meningitis and died at 3:15 a.m. today. Obstetrician Dr. Gobit was beside her for several hours, then rapidly performed a dissection. Sixty seconds later, he surprisingly extracted a girl from the dead body. The court ruled today that a dissection could be performed after the mother's death. The mother's husband no longer insists that the infant must die with the mother, but yesterday he strongly opposed the surgery. He later changed his mind. Doctors and nurses began surgery eight minutes after the mother's death. Fortunately, the mother's blood was still circulating, saving the infant in the abdomen. There is no precedent for this case. The hospital is consulting with legal experts to study the responsibility of sacrificing the mother to save the infant. Judge Garonan declared that if the mother's heart has stopped beating for one minute, performing surgery is legal. According to doctors, if surgery is performed within a few minutes after the mother's death, the infant still has a chance of survival. (6th National News dispatch)

### Germany Greatly Disappointed by the Large Trade Deficit With Manchukuo

Berlin Trade figures between Germany and "Manchukuo" have always been listed under trade between China and Germany. Now, German officials have announced trade figures between the country and "Manchukuo" for the first half of the year, which has been opened in a separate column outside of trade between the two countries of China. According to this figure, Germany purchased goods worth 32,000,000 marks, and "Manchukuo" purchased goods worth 4,000,000 marks. Compared with the two, Germany has a trade deficit of 28,000,000 marks. Regarding this level, German business people originally thought that after the German-Manchukuo trade agreement (produced on May 1, 1936) was established, Germany's exports to "Manchukuo" would greatly increase, and at least the trade figures between the two parties would increase equally. The result was the opposite, and no one was disappointed. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon

Undecided on Entering Nanjing; No Statement Released; Difficult to Start Negotiations Due to Japanese Troops Pressing the Border

Japanese Ambassador to China Shigeru Kawagoe, returning to his post in China, arrived in Shanghai on June 29. He once went to Nanjing, and then left Shanghai to go north on the 8th of last month. He was detained in Tianjin by the local Japanese garrison authorities, lingering in Tianjin for a month. It was not until recently that he and Chinese Counselor Shimizu and Secretary Hoshida traveled from Tianjin to Dalian and took the Dalian Steamship Company's Qingdao Maru, returning south to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock. The ship docked at the Yangshupu Huangpu Wharf. The Consul General Okamoto in Shanghai, Consuls Yoshioka, Tajiri, the Information Minister of the Embassy, ​​Secretary General Zomi, Commerce Official Iwai, Army Attache Kita, Naval Attache Honda, and Zhou Jue, Secretary of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Chen Ming, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, went to meet him. After landing, he drove directly to the official residence on Bishun Road to rest. At 6 o'clock, he summoned Okamoto, Tajiri, Shimizu, Zomi, etc. to hold a meeting to describe his meeting with the local garrison authorities in Tianjin. He listened to Okamoto and others' reports on the situation in Nanjing and Shanghai, and discussed the matter. At first, when Kawagoe arrived, reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers met him at the wharf. Kawagoe refused to make a statement because he was unprepared. Our reporters' group raised a few points in writing and asked for a reply. Kawagoe instructed Shimizu to arrange to reply to the reporters at 6:30 that night. When the reporters went to his official residence on time, Shimizu again declined to meet them on the grounds that he had no time to meet. At this time when the clouds of war are permeating, a peaceful atmosphere suddenly emerges. The actions of this national diplomatic representative are particularly watched by the public. However, Kawagoe once claimed that whether he would immediately enter Nanjing has not yet been decided. Kawagoe also observes the recklessness of the soldiers of that country. At the same time, it is difficult to start diplomatic negotiations with our country under the pressure of the large army of that country. For the time being, we can only stay in Shanghai to observe the development of the situation.

The Allied News Agency reported on the 7th that Ambassador Kawagoe, who arrived in Shanghai today, released a statement at 10 p.m. as follows: The Sino-Japanese situation is becoming more serious and subtle, and its objective situation is gradually moving towards a crisis, which is developing quite a lot. This is the current situation I observed. I firmly want to make the final effort and attempt to solve it by diplomatic means.

### Central Committee Member Xiao Zhenying Talks About the Current Situation

Only by Launching a Full-Scale War of Resistance; Going to Nanjing This Morning to Meet Chairman Chiang

Central Committee member Xiao Zhenying returned to China on the 6th and arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, at his private residence on Massenet Road, he met with Wu Huanzhang, Wang Ziyao, and many others, and went out to visit friends. It was originally scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing at 11 o'clock that evening with Go Dingyuan, Counselor of the Executive Yuan, Li Shijun, Director of the 29th Army's Office in Nanjing, Li Guang'an, Director of the Office in Shanghai, and Wu Huanzhang, a member of the Legislative Yuan. Later, because things were not finished, it was changed to take the capital express train to Nanjing at 8 o'clock today. Xiao is scheduled to meet Chairman Chiang and the central figures after arriving in Nanjing, and then go north to meet Song Zheyuan, Commander of the 29th Army. According to Xiao, he went to Europe and the United States to inspect, traversing Italy, England, France, Germany, Russia, the United States, and 21 other countries, and deeply felt that each country has its own advantages and strengths. It is a pity that there was not enough time to investigate further. When I was in the Soviet Union, I learned that the situation in North China was critical. When I arrived in Poland, it was confirmed that the Lugouqiao Incident had broken out, and I felt deeply saddened. Then I decided to return to China. When I arrived in England, I received a telegram from Nanjing calling me back, so I hurried back from the United States. In the face of the current situation, only by launching a full-scale war of resistance can the nation survive. This is not enough to say my own opinion, but it is the unanimous request of the whole country. As for the result of the war of resistance, we don't have to consider its success or failure. At the very least, it will inevitably lead to mutual destruction. Division Commander Zhao Dengyu was unusually loyal and brave on weekdays, always leading the troops in every battle, and he especially valued the concept of the country. This time, he died for the country in the war of resistance. Division Commander Zhao and I have been friends for 20 years. On the one hand, I am sad for him, and on the other hand, I deeply feel that the glorious death of my old friend can be said to be a death worthy of his place. Xiao finished speaking and wept, and the reporter also felt sad, so he said goodbye and left.

### Overflowing Throughout China's Territory: A United Spirit to Resist the Enemy

Border Residents Voluntarily Exert Efforts to Kill the Enemy; Youths Think of Using Blood to Wash Away Shame; The People of Kang and Tibet

The People of Kang and Tibet

Ms. Liu Manqing, the current Section Chief of the State Council's Secretariat, is an outstanding talent from Xikang. She twice represented the government in 1929 and 1933, traveling swiftly to Kang and Tibet to communicate with the Dalai Lama and others, achieving considerable success. Ms. Liu came to Shanghai yesterday afternoon on official business. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency, considering the recent movements of our border regions after the Sino-Japanese Incident to be a point that cannot be ignored, specifically visited her residence. According to her, the people of Kang and Tibet have gradually strengthened their faith in the central government in recent years. After the outbreak of the North China Incident, local natives, driven by patriotism, suddenly became tense. Young men and strong adults all voluntarily rose up to organize volunteer teams to be ready to be loyal to the country at any time and exert efforts to resist the enemy. The elderly, women, and children pray with incense every day, hoping to eliminate disasters for the country. Although whether such actions are appropriate is certainly questionable, their patriotic zeal is undiminished. In short, the spirit of defending the country and resisting the enemy has spread throughout the entire Chinese territory, which is deeply gratifying. Ms. Liu finally said that there are about two hundred Kang and Tibetan people currently serving in the capital. They have already begun concrete organization. If, unfortunately, the war extends to the capital, all Kang and Tibetan people vow to die with the city and will never seek to escape.

In order to prevent villains from mixing in, the procedure for joining the corps is very strict. Among the more than 500 members, more than 100 are women. In the future, the work will be divided into rescue and military teams. After a general assembly of all members is held in Shanghai within days, they will depart north, attempting to use the hot blood of youth to cleanse the shame of being invaded by the enemy. The corps also issued an appeal to the national public yesterday, with particularly indignant words.

Overseas Chinese Youth

The Central Government has decided on a policy of resistance, and you, sir, have also made a solemn statement that there will be no compromise midway. The survival of our nation depends on this action. The people in Shanghai's artistic circles would rather be shattered jade than intact tiles, and vow to be a strong support for the government, jointly facing the national crisis in order to fight for the dignity of our nation and preserve the glory of our history.

### Du Yuesheng Gives Broadcast Speech Yesterday to Raise National Salvation Donations

Economic War of Resistance Stands on the Front Lines; Destroying Homes to Relieve the National Crisis Are Both Heroes on the Battlefield

Du Yuesheng gave a broadcast speech on the radio station of the Ministry of Communications yesterday to raise national salvation donations. The topic was 'Please Compatriots Help the Government with Real Strength'. The original text is as follows: "Fellow compatriots, you all understand very well that the newspapers these past few days have clearly told us that the country has reached a critical juncture of life and death, which means that all compatriots across the country have reached a critical juncture of life and death. From the 'September 18th Incident' until now, seven years have passed in a flash. During these seven years, we have been subjected to the oppression of the enemy. We have often endured hardship and worked hard while waiting for the world's fair opinion. However, the ambition of the aggressors has not diminished for the sake of world opinion but has become even more intense. It is not enough to plunder eastern Hebei and northern Chahar; now they have even crossed into the entire North China. If we continue to tolerate it, then they will definitely take another step and annex our entire China. Fellow compatriots, the country has now reached a critical juncture of life and death. We must quickly unite to save the country, which is to save ourselves. The Lugouqiao Incident is being watched by people all over the world and criticized by the press in various countries. Spain and China, on opposite sides of the globe, are staging a tragic play. Although China has suffered a great humiliation, Japan's large-scale bombing of non-war zone cities and towns in China and the massacre of defenseless people in China have completely exposed its wild nature. The tragic situation of the North China compatriots who have been robbed this time, as disclosed in the newspapers, is probably less than one-ten-thousandth of the truth. Thousands of miles of scorched earth, the flesh and blood of tens of thousands of soldiers, and millions of displaced compatriots are all facts, and these facts will be left to the world's fair opinion. Fellow compatriots, but we must not have a dependent mentality and hope for help from others. Saving the country completely depends on our own strength. If we do not work hard, then the compatriots in North China who have suffered can be regarded as our predecessors. The enemy's invasion has no end, and now we are forced to retreat with no way out. I have explained in detail above that the ancients had a saying, 'Even a trapped beast will fight,' which means that when a wild beast is forced to have no way to retreat, it will still fight with others regardless of everything. Is our courage even inferior to that of a wild beast? But I want to announce to the people of the world that we are definitely not a nation that likes to fight. We are originally a people who love peace. We are willing to seek peace in equality and mutual benefit. We were not quick to sacrifice, but we were forced to resist. We are resisting for self-preservation. Until now, our people are still abiding by the government's consistent position. We are responding to war, not seeking war. Fellow compatriots, now that the country has reached a critical juncture of life and death, everything must not be taken into consideration, because it is a critical juncture of life and death for the entire nation. Only by uniting the strength of the entire nation can we resist. The strength of the people should be provided to the country. Those with strength should contribute strength, and those with money should contribute money. The strength of the people and the strength of the government must be united as one. This is what constitutes a sound country. You must understand that the lives and property of the people can only be protected by the state. If we look at the history of various subjugated countries, no people can preserve their lives and property after the country is subjugated. Let's take the history of the fall of the Ming Dynasty in our country. When Li Zicheng besieged Beijing, Emperor Chongzhen convened a meeting of ministers and asked them to find ways to donate money to relieve the national crisis, but none of them could do anything. Later, when Li Zicheng captured Beijing, he clamped all the rich people in Beijing with boards one by one. All the property of officials and people in Beijing was taken away by Li Zicheng without leaving anything behind. Almost everyone in the country knows this part of the history of the late Ming Dynasty. Everyone wants to protect his children and grandchildren, and everyone wants to cherish his property. Only by destroying homes to relieve the national crisis can we preserve the country. Otherwise, we may not be able to avoid being the people in Beijing during the late Ming Dynasty. If we cannot actively help the country now, the result is no different from leaving our property to the enemy's military needs. I don't think there is a patriotic compatriot who would want to be a person in Beijing during the late Ming Dynasty who was clamped and went bankrupt. With the same sacrifice of all property, we still have to leave a legacy of infamy for thousands of years. Moreover, modern warfare must have many conditions. The importance of airplanes, artillery, food, and medicine is generally known. In fact, the economy is more important than everything else. The victory in the European War depended on the economy. The United States did not participate in fierce warfare during the European War, but it defeated Germany entirely on its economic strength. This is the best example. Now that the science of warfare is becoming more advanced, the effectiveness of the economy is becoming greater. The victory or defeat of a war between two countries can be determined in advance based on economic measures. In ordinary times, we are constantly at war in industry and commerce. It is precisely because we neglected the economic war in the past that we were underestimated by the enemy, which led to today's national crisis. Past mistakes can only be left to be corrected in the future. Now, everyone must destroy their homes to relieve the national crisis and be a backing for the government. You must understand that those who cut down generals and seize flags on the front lines are indeed heroes who defend the country, and those who destroy their homes to relieve the national crisis in the rear are also heroes who defend the country. The survival or extinction of the Chinese nation depends on the expression of the strength of the masses this time."

"Fellow compatriots, everyone must understand that the spiritual war between the people of the two countries had already begun long before the outbreak of the overall war of resistance. Our compatriots across the country are running around calling for the raising of national salvation donations. The people on the other side are also holding donation drives in their country. Our donations are used to resist power, and their donations are used for aggression. If their people do not donate, they can preserve their international credibility and the unnecessary sacrifices of soldiers. However, our donations are for preserving the survival of the Chinese nation and for maintaining the state of the Republic of China. The nature of the donations from the two countries is completely opposite. Their people do not have to donate to the government, but our people must donate to the government. As usual, our donations must be more enthusiastic than theirs. If it can really be as I said, that we are certainly enthusiastic, then our spiritual war and economic war will be won. If the economic war can be won, then the military war can be guaranteed. Everyone, we are really standing on the front lines in the war of resistance to save the country. In the sense of this donation, we are very dominant. Everything depends on everyone's efforts. Let's first overwhelm the enemy in terms of the amount of donations, which is the success of our first battle in the voice of resistance. If we can achieve our hope, we must work harder. In fact, we are not only seeking to overwhelm the enemy once, even if we win. The most important thing is to be able to persevere in the struggle. The most shameful thing for us is that we are often criticized for only having five minutes of enthusiasm. Everyone, hurry up and use facts to cancel this criticism. We all know that national salvation donations are truly the basic work of revitalizing the national state. Everyone must have a spirit of permanent persistence and do it consistently. Even when the national crisis is lifted, we must continue to donate because in any undertaking, any struggle, whoever can persevere, whoever can achieve the final victory. What I have said today is really not to say how concise and thorough it is, but just to express some of my personal opinions. Fortunately, we don't need to say much, but focus on doing it earnestly. I hope that all compatriots across the country will work together and hurry up to do it. That's all."

### Overseas Chinese Returning from the United States Raise Money to Save the Country

Overseas Chinese in the United States love their motherland and have never lagged behind others. In the past, they have always contributed as much as possible to various charitable donations. This time, after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the compatriots in various cities in the United States have organized anti-enemy support associations and have successively collected funds to remit back to the motherland. When the Empress of Asia arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 7th), dozens of overseas Chinese returning to the country, initiated by Yu Shi and others, held a temporary national salvation donation drive and raised a total of 324 yuan, 3 jiao, and 1 fen in national currency, which was handed over to the Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association Fundraising Committee for submission to the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government.

### Two Compatriot Associations Meet to Handle Relief Efforts

Danyang　The Danyang Shanghai Compatriots Association at No. 14, Fangxie Road, convened an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its clubhouse at 8:00 PM on the 6th. More than 30 people, including Pei Yuanding, attended. The chairman reported on the situation of attending the Shanghai Relief Committee's symposium of compatriot organizations, saying that the association should engage in relief preparations and, at a minimum, restore the spirit of the January 28th relief efforts. The points indicated by the Relief Committee were then discussed, and detailed decisions were made. Standing director Han Jingqi and others were also appointed to reside in the Relief Committee to assist in handling matters. It was also resolved to investigate the accurate addresses and skills of compatriots living in Shanghai within one week for statistics and to discuss the collection of national salvation donations and scrap metal, among other important cases.

Five Counties　About 100,000 compatriots from the five counties of Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi who are living in Shanghai have recently returned to their hometowns one after another due to the serious national crisis. However, the original ships are either in dock for repairs or have changed course due to official business, causing cargo to be congested. Those waiting for ships at the port are crowded. The association has held emergency meetings for days and decided to shorten the voyage. Except for the Tongyang route, which will operate as usual, the Shensha route ships will, from today onwards, go directly to Haihong, Niugang, and Lingdian ports, without stopping at other ports. In this way, time can be saved, and passengers can arrive earlier. Waiting for the ship to depart at any time. After the measures were agreed upon, the association pushed Gu Nanqun, Shen Xibin, Zhu Yisan, and Huang Jiping to contact separately and telegraphed the county chiefs of Chonghai and Qi to handle matters properly. In addition, the association temporarily added four groups—general affairs, fundraising, hygiene, and supply—to handle refugee relief matters, which is extremely busy.

### Social Bureau Establishes Legal Consultation Office

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs previously established the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, which has been actively working for several months and has achieved results in areas such as relief for those out of school, bank investigations, unemployment relief, and employment guidance.

According to Cui, the office's general office has been set up at No. 45, Avenue Emile Zola, and several branch offices have been set up in densely populated areas. As for the inquiry method, it is as simple as possible. Anyone who has questions about the law can inquire by letter, telephone, or in person at the office, and the office will introduce the consultant lawyer to inquire face to face. If the inquired matter must go through litigation and the person is extremely poor, the office will hire a pro bono lawyer for them. The office is a government agency and is completely obligated for everything without taking any fees. The internal staff and major policies have been decided, and they will all be concurrently held by personnel from the Social Bureau or the Vocational Guidance Center. It is heard that the hired consultants include lawyers such as Guo Wei, Wang Liwu, and Yin Tinghua.

They will be delivered soon and sent to the Ministry of Military Affairs of the National Government in Nanjing. The second round of fundraising is still being planned.



### Review of the Public Performance of 'Defend Lugou Bridge'

— Li Wen

㊀ The Script

The enemy's artillery fire at the Lugou Bridge stirred the hearts of every Chinese compatriot unwilling to be a slave! The highest military leader expressed with iron determination to the national populace: the final moment has arrived, there is only resistance to the end! This excited and strengthened the will and awareness of every Chinese compatriot unwilling to be a slave!

China, you are roaring!

Standing at the forefront of national defense culture, the Shanghai theater community first mobilized a broad group of playwrights and actors, to create the most incisive national defense play—Defend Lugou Bridge!—through collective creation, completing the script, and very quickly staging it at the Penglai Grand Theater with the joint participation of various theater troupes.

Yes, we must defend Lugou Bridge! Recover lost territory!

The script is composed of three parts, each of which can be performed independently. A total of twenty-six people participated in the creative process. This is an unprecedented event in our country's theater community!

Indeed, judging from a purely artistic point of view, there are many aspects of this script that would not suit the tastes of some high-class gentlemen. For example, it completely lacks 'subtlety'! It's 'too sharp', and as a result, although the concession is our land, it cannot be performed within the concession, and it is limited to a corner of the Penglai Theater in the city. However, precisely because of this, it is an explosive thrown into the depths of the populace, violently stimulating every audience member's nerves, boiling their blood, so that everyone rises up and rushes towards the enemy!

Judging from the script, the most stimulating part of the whole play is the second part, which is almost an exchange of blood and tears, congealing into a picture of life-and-death struggle. One has this feeling simply from reading the script. Here, the loyalty and courage of soldiers and lower-level officers in serving the country, the ugly state of upper-level bureaucrats surrendering and begging for peace, the solidarity of the broad masses of people and soldiers in swearing to kill the enemy for the survival of the nation, many complex truths are revealed in the most exciting scenes and techniques. The second best is the first part, which reflects 'the eve of the storm' from a peaceful rural village, with emotions gradually rising, but perhaps because it had to consider the connection with the second part later, it concludes with the appearance of Chinese soldiers, and the originally raised climax—the rampages of the Japanese devils—suddenly turns in another direction, not giving people greater stimulation. The third part is somewhat weaker, the development of the play is not tight enough. Whether using this kind of scene to depict national resistance is the best method seems to be debatable. The play lacks depth, which is its shortcoming.

Such is my understanding of the script, but the effect on stage is not entirely the same as what one gets from reading the script.

(二) The Performance　　Tai Sheng

In an atmosphere of madness, excitement, and fervor, it can be said that not a single scene of the three-act play failed to firmly grip the audience. We heard the roars on stage, and we also heard the roars from the audience. This kind of madly fervent emotion fully expressed the Chinese people's determination to demand resistance!

The first part, "The Eve of the Storm"—in that teahouse, the Japanese soldiers' drill, ruining the beans and farmland of Lugou Bridge Village, and the men, women, and children being shot by the Japanese soldiers, I only want to point out two things in this scene, hoping for a change: (1) After the Japanese soldiers appear in the teahouse, they demolish the teahouse and whip Ding Datou. All the farmers just silently watch the Japanese soldiers' rage, and only after the Japanese soldiers leave does Liu Debiao, who shouted the loudest, shout again: "We want to go and kill the Japanese soldiers!" The audience actually laughed at this point. I think the script should be changed in this place, otherwise, the effect will be too bad; second, the effects of the Twenty-ninth Route Army's arrival, the soldiers' singing, bugle calls, war drums, etc., all seemed insufficiently fervent and tense.

The second part, "Lugou Bridge is Our Grave"—the script captures the current situation of "obeying orders" and "hesitating to decide" very well, but after the start of the war, the sound effects of gunshots, machine gun fire, hand grenade flames, etc., were too poor.

The third part, "National Resistance"—this should be the climax of the whole play. Although the positions of the actors are a bit chaotic, the effect obtained is very good because the emotions are very fervent. Especially during the shouting of "Defend Lugou Bridge" and the slogans of resistance, the entire theater was in a frenzy.

When Beiping, Tianjin, Lugou Bridge, and Wanping have completely fallen, and the overall resistance of the entire China is about to begin, the performance of "Defend Lugou Bridge" gave us an exciting stimulant.
