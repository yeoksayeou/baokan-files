### Intense Fighting on the Banks of the Suzhou Creek, Two Enemy Attempts to Cross Were Repelled

A Small Number of Remaining Enemy Troops in Zhoujiaqiao Are Being Cleared Out by Us. Enemy Forces Fiercely Attacking Jiangqiao and Xiaonanxiang Have All Been Driven Back. Our Air Force Bombed Enemy Positions in Zhabei Last Night.

The enemy army is attempting to cross the Suzhou Creek, and is now actively beginning again. Along both banks of the Suzhou Creek, from Zhoujiaqiao to Beixinjing, and from Beixinjing to Shenj浜, the fighting was unusually fierce throughout yesterday, with artillery fire ceaseless all day. The western district of the concession also heard the booming sounds clearly. The afternoon was especially intense. Stray bullets were numerous in the Zhaofeng Park and Caojiadu areas of western Shanghai. Three more British soldiers on guard duty were injured by enemy artillery shells. From Zhoujiaqiao to Beixinjing, the enemy army repeatedly used artillery fire for cover, and also released smoke bombs, in an attempt to cross the river and attack southward. Yesterday at dawn, a small number of enemy soldiers, under the cover of smoke bombs, crossed the river at the northern end of Luobiegen Road in Beixinjing, numbering approximately eighty. Our army calmly responded, and after the smoke cleared, took advantage of their unstable footing and launched a fierce attack. Approximately fifty enemy soldiers who crossed the river were annihilated, and the rest fell into the water and fled. In the afternoon, the enemy army made a second attempt to cross, releasing smoke at the northern end of Huobilan Road in Zhoujiaqiao, and concentrating artillery fire for cover, forcibly building pontoon bridges. One enemy team was also able to cross the river. Our army launched a sudden attack, and fierce fighting ensued in the area along the creek. Under our army's fierce assault, by midnight last night, only a very small number of remaining enemy troops remained, and they are being cleared out, which should be fully resolved. On the central front of the entire line, fighting was also ceaseless throughout yesterday. Large groups of enemy troops fiercely attacked our army's positions on the line from Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonanxiang, with intense artillery and infantry battles. The enemy was extremely eager to infiltrate Xiaonanxiang, hoping to shake our army's left and right flank positions. Our army bravely fought back, and the positions remained firmly in place. Our army's left flank, north of Xiaonanxiang, from Guangfu to Liuhe, was relatively quiet. The enemy seemed to have taken no action in that area. The loyal and brave soldiers of our army who withdrew from Zhabei yesterday, after retreating to a safe area, have now moved to another location to rest.

### Fierce Fighting on the Entire Line North and South of Xiaonanxiang, Our Army Annihilated Over Six Hundred Enemy Soldiers

Enemy Attack on Taiping'an Has Been Repelled. Our Army Firmly Defends Its Positions, Remaining Steadfast. We Also Achieved Victory on the North Bank of Beixinjing.

A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 1:00 PM on the 31st that at around 4:30 AM this morning, the enemy charged from Zhenbei Road, past Lizhai, and pressed upon Huangjiazhai, our position. Our army's × Regiment bravely intercepted them, engaging in combat four or five times. Fighting continued until about 8:00 AM, when a temporary ceasefire was called.

A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 12:30 AM on the 1st that starting at 2:30 AM yesterday morning, fierce fighting erupted again on the entire line north and south of Xiaonanxiang, lasting for five hours. Our army launched a frontal assault, annihilating over six hundred enemy soldiers. At 2:00 PM, the enemy sent reinforcements to attack again, but they were also repelled by us.

A Central News Agency correspondent reported at 12:30 AM on the 1st that on the north bank of Beixinjing, our army had been confronting the enemy for four days, with twenty major and minor battles. Our army had achieved victory in all of them. At 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the enemy again attacked us with a force of over four thousand men, supported by mechanized units. We immediately intercepted them, dividing the enemy into several sections and attacking each one fiercely. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the enemy army retreated in fear.

Central News Agency reports that the enemy is actively attacking our Xiaonanxiang to Jiangqiao line of defense. Starting early yesterday morning, they used the combined firepower of aircraft and artillery to bombard us. Around noon, the artillery fire subsided slightly, and the enemy launched a full-scale assault on our entire line, but they were all repelled by us. The two strongholds of Xiaonanxiang and Jiangqiao Town have always been firmly defended by our army, and there has been absolutely no change in the entire line of defense. In the evening, fierce artillery fire broke out again, but the enemy infantry did not attack again.

A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 10:00 PM on the 31st that the enemy was still fiercely attacking the Xiaonanxiang to Jiangqiao section. This afternoon, under the cover of artillery and aircraft, the enemy attacked Taiping'an, north of Jiangqiao. Our army bravely charged through the artillery fire and launched an assault. Fighting continued fiercely into the night, and our army's position remained steadfast.

### Yesterday, the Enemy Army Made Several Attempts to Cross the Suzhou Creek

At Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao, They Failed After Being Fiercely Attacked by Our Army.

Central News Agency reports that for several days, the enemy army has been using artillery to bombard our positions on the south bank from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, and multiple aircraft have been wantonly bombing various villages and towns along the creek. Their infantry has attempted to cross the river several times, but all have been repelled by our army. Yesterday morning, taking advantage of the heavy rain and fog, and releasing smoke for cover, they again attempted to cross. However, after about eighty people had crossed, our army immediately launched a head-on assault, annihilating the majority of them, and the remnants fled in disarray. In the afternoon, a second attempt to cross failed. Subsequently, both sides engaged in artillery fire, which continued into the night. The following is a report on the battle situation at 10:07 PM last night from our agency's correspondent with the army.

### General Situation on Both Banks

The area where the enemy and we are confronting each other on both banks of the Suzhou Creek extends from the west of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to Shenj浜, with a length of approximately seven kilometers. Among them, the section from the railway to Zhoujiaqiao is approximately one kilometer, with two bridges in between, but both have been destroyed by our army. The section from Zhoujiaqiao to Beixinjing is approximately two and a half kilometers long, with a straight river course and many factories and villages on both banks, which can be used as strongholds. The section from Beixinjing to Shenj浜 is approximately three and a half kilometers long, with a winding river course and many ports and streams on the north bank. In terms of terrain, the river bank in the Beixinjing section is high in the north and low in the south, and the western section has many ports and streams, making it easier to cross. The enemy previously crossed stealthily, entering the Suzhou Creek from Xitou'an via the Panjia Port with small boats. Therefore, our army has been particularly vigilant at these two locations and the mouths of the ports and streams.

### The Initial Crossing Was Annihilated by Us

At dawn yesterday morning, it was rainy and foggy, and enemy aircraft could not operate, so they released smoke. Approximately one hundred enemy soldiers crossed the Suzhou Creek from the opposite bank of Beixinjing. Although their actions were very stealthy, they were intercepted by our army before they could establish a firm foothold. The enemy resisted stubbornly with their backs to the river, and most of them were annihilated by us. The remnants fled in disarray. At 1:00 PM, it was discovered that approximately one enemy company was gathered at Majiazhai on the opposite bank, seemingly planning to cross the river again. Our army immediately bombarded them with mortars, hitting them multiple times, causing heavy casualties, and scattering them in disarray. They ultimately failed to proceed according to their original plan.

### Another Fierce Attack in the Afternoon

At 1:00 PM, the enemy again released smoke in the Zhoujiaqiao area to cover their crossing, and forcibly built pontoon bridges. Our army launched a sudden attack, confronting them in the area along the creek, fighting fiercely until 7:00 PM. Only a dozen or so enemy soldiers remained, unable to retreat, and they were about to be completely eliminated. At around 3:00 PM, approximately forty or fifty enemy soldiers also crossed from Jiangjiazhai on the north bank to Liujiazhai on the south bank. Our army had made preparations in advance, and when they landed and had not yet dispersed, we immediately rushed out and surrounded them, annihilating them. At around 4:00 PM, the weather cleared, and enemy aircraft were deployed for reconnaissance for a long time, dropping several bombs. However, the artillery fire from both sides did not stop into the night.

### Intense Fighting in the Western District

The fighting was most intense at around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. A reporter ventured to observe the battle, and when passing through the western district of the concession, the sound of artillery was dense, and there were few pedestrians on the road, all with worried expressions. Occasionally, people could be seen carrying boxes and baskets, moving eastward to take refuge, but their number was not large. Upon reaching the destination, only a few hundred meters from the front line, there were no people to be seen, with only a few military police stationed there. The streets were quiet, and the sound of gunfire was particularly jarring. Ascending to a high vantage point, one could only see swirling smoke, connecting with the clouds, a vast expanse stretching for several miles. On both banks of the creek, there were three locations where fires were burning fiercely, with flames soaring upwards. The sound of machine guns was intermittent, originating from a distance, and was not as dense and tense as the sound of artillery. After about 4:00 PM, the rain stopped, and one enemy reconnaissance plane circled several times, but after being attacked by our army with anti-aircraft guns, it seemed to have been hit once. The plane suddenly moved northward, descending towards the enemy's position, but eventually struggled to rise again, but after that, it did not dare to fly low.

### Our Air Force Bombed the Enemy Army Yesterday

The Enemy Was Moving Very Busily, We Dropped Over Ten Bombs.

Central News Agency reports that at around 6:00 PM last night, our air force ventured into Shanghai in the rain to scout enemy positions. Although the enemy army fired with anti-aircraft guns, it was not intense. When our plane passed through Zhabei, it saw the enemy army moving very busily and dropped over ten bombs. Several places caught fire, and the enemy army suffered heavy losses.

### Intense Artillery Battles on the Huangpu River the Night Before Last and Yesterday Morning

Four Battles, the Front Line Extended Over Twenty Li. The Enemy Flagship Izumo and Destroyers Were Damaged.

At 7:30 PM the night before last, our garrison in Pudong received reports that the enemy was planning to use wooden rafts to send troops to attempt a landing. They immediately ordered a strict alert along the entire Pudong line. At the same time, the artillery positions first fired artillery shells at the enemy positions in eastern Shanghai. The enemy ships on the Huangpu River hurriedly fired back, and the battle was quite fierce. At around 8:00 PM, lookout soldiers of ours discovered dark shadows looming on the surface of the Huangpu River in the area of Taitong Wharf and New Mitsui Warehouse east of Lujiazui. There were about a dozen rows of wooden rafts, each carrying fifteen soldiers, with sandbags piled in front and machine guns mounted on top, being towed by several small boats, attempting to rush to the beaches at those locations. Our garrison at each port did not wait for them to approach, and used heavy machine guns to fire fiercely into the river. The other side also returned fire. At around 9:00 PM, the outposts reported that the enemy's wooden rafts had been repelled. Subsequently, the sound of gunfire from both sides diminished. At 9:45 PM, our artillery team again displayed its power, continuously firing shells into the enemy's positions. The ×× artillery team joined the battle, and the enemy warships, ranging from the Japanese Consulate to the fish market, over ten large and small warships, jointly bombarded us, extending the battle line for over twenty li. The fierce fighting stopped after 10:30 PM. Then, at around 11:00 PM, our side and the enemy side engaged in a third artillery battle, and Chinese and foreign people alike were awakened from their sleep at midnight by the booming sound of artillery. The target of our artillery focused on the vicinity of the enemy warships. The flagship Izumo was hit by our artillery fire. The enemy Destroyer No. 1, anchored at Buoy No. 37, was hit by our artillery fire, and many enemy soldiers were killed and wounded, demonstrating the state of panic of the enemy warships at that time. The fighting stopped at 2:00 AM yesterday morning. The enemy's positions in the Yangshupu and Zhabei areas were also severely damaged. At around 3:00 AM, the enemy warships fiercely bombarded Pudong again in an attempt to retaliate. Our side, having completed its mission, ignored it. After the enemy fired for half an hour, seeing that we were not moving, they stopped at around 3:30 AM. In the four artillery battles last night, the enemy warships fired a total of three or four hundred shells. Only a small number of civilian houses were destroyed, and there were over a dozen civilians, including Shen Wenkui, who were wounded by shrapnel. Zhang Fengzhi died without being rescued due to his intestines flowing out. As for our army's fortifications, they were not damaged at all.

### Stray Bullets Were Flying Everywhere in the Public Concession

The Enemy Set Fire to Our Civilian Residences on Wuchang Road.

In the western Shanghai area yesterday, the fighting between the enemy and our army was fierce, and the sound of artillery fire did not cease all day. Stray bullets were flying everywhere in the Public Concession, and many people were injured. The details are recorded separately below: ⑴ At 10:00 AM, two British soldiers stationed on Bailey Gate Road were wounded in the thigh by enemy artillery shells. ⑵ At 1:50 PM, a Chinese police officer at the intersection of Changping Road and Jiaozhou Road was injured in the leg. ⑶ At 3:45 PM, a man was killed and a woman was injured by stray bullets on Yichang Road, Xiaoshadu Road. ⑷ Three men near Zhaofeng Park on Yuwei Road were also wounded by stray bullets. All of the above-mentioned people were sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, and fortunately, their injuries were minor and they should recover within a few days.

Also, the residence of Tang Zhongliang at No. 537 Wuchang Road, North Sichuan Road, was set on fire by the enemy yesterday, and the houses have been completely reduced to ashes.

### The Enemy Notified Various Consulates to Bomb Nanshi

Enemy Aircraft Circle and Reconnoiter Nanshi, Caojiadu, and Longhua Yesterday.

Central News Agency reports that it has been learned that the enemy notified the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France stationed in Shanghai yesterday morning, and relayed to various churches, schools, and organizations in the Nanshi area, ordering the foreign nationals residing there to relocate immediately, stating that they would bomb Nanshi yesterday afternoon. It is heard that the French side has sent the navy to Nanshi to protect the main water pipes of the waterworks.

Central News Agency reports that at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, two enemy aircraft flew to the sky above Nanshi, circling back and forth and repeatedly reconnoitering for about half an hour, then flew eastward without dropping any bombs.

Central News Agency reports that although it was drizzling yesterday, enemy aircraft were still active, circling for a long time in a small area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line, from Caojiadu to Longhua, often flying low to reconnoiter our army's machine gun positions. Our army continuously bombarded them with anti-aircraft machine guns, and the enemy aircraft fled in disarray.

### Chaozhou Women Weave a Flag to Present to Chiang Kai-shek

[Shantou] Women from Chaozhou and its affiliated regions expressed their sincerity in loving their leader by each weaving one stitch to produce an embroidered banner, presented to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. (Central News Agency, 31st)

### Enemy Aircraft Carrier Arrived at Wusong Yesterday

Carrying Food, Bombs, etc.

At approximately 3:00 PM on the 29th, one enemy aircraft carrier sailed from Sasebo to Shanghai, mooring in the Sanjiashui waters outside Wusong, carrying 45 of the latest model seaplanes, and over 2,000 bombs. Today (31st) at 7:30 AM, two more enemy transport ships of unknown number, and the Shanghai Maru, a transport ship converted from a merchant ship, successively sailed to Shanghai, docking at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf and Huishan Wharf, carrying food, bombs, and other military supplies, which were immediately unloaded and brought ashore.

### The Municipal Government Comforts the Xie Regiment

The Person in Charge of Xueyuan Generously Donated

Central News Agency reports that the brave soldiers of the Xie Regiment who stubbornly resisted the enemy and defended the Sihang Warehouse have been ordered to withdraw and have arrived at their destination. The municipal government purchased 2,100 pieces of Western-style pastries from the Xueyuan Food Company on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday to reward all the soldiers. Yao Shaohua and Yuan Zhizhuang, the people in charge of Xueyuan, admired the loyalty and righteousness of the brave soldiers and generously donated them. The municipal government has sent a letter of thanks.

### Impressions of Our Loyal and Brave Four Hundred Isolated Soldiers Withdrawing from Zhabei

Many Officers and Soldiers Recount the Process of Attack and Defense. The Da Mei Evening News Records the Truth of the Withdrawal.

The 377 brave soldiers of the Yang Battalion of the 88th Division's Xie Regiment (in addition, there are 26 wounded and several seriously wounded), who had been isolated in Zhabei for over 120 hours, were ordered to reluctantly withdraw from the Sihang Warehouse at 2:10 AM yesterday morning. They have now been transferred to a certain location for rest from a safe area. A reporter followed the Xie Regiment to a certain location and learned about the entire battalion's experience of bravely defending the Sihang Warehouse and fighting the enemy. The details are recorded as follows:

They Left the Sihang at Two O'Clock Yesterday Morning.

Our army, isolated in Zhabei, received a secret order from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and at 2:10 AM yesterday morning, they tidied up their machine guns, ammunition, and rations, and calmly left the Sihang Warehouse, which they had defended in isolation for four days. At the time of departure, the enemy's artillery fire was fierce. After four days of attack without any results, they used rapid-fire guns and other fierce weapons to concentrate their bombardment. However, our army had received the order to withdraw and remained calm, preparing in advance, personally escorted and protected by Regiment Adjutant Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu. At that time, Regiment Adjutant Xie also left over thirty machine gunners near the Sihang to return fire on the enemy's attacking forces, and they completely withdrew at around 3:00 AM.

The Wounded Soldiers Continued to Fight.

Because there were many troops, the retreat was not easy, and because the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, over thirty soldiers of the escorting troops were injured. Regiment Commander Xie was slightly wounded, and Battalion Commander Yang was injured in the ankle, but they still bravely fought the enemy, not retreating at all. At around 3:15 AM, the escorting troops all retreated to a safe area with Xie and Yang.

The Sacrificed Loyal Corpses Will Forever Exude Righteousness.

The enemy was completely unaware of our army's withdrawal and continued to attack with fierce artillery fire. Half an hour later, the enemy forces saw no movement and began to grope forward, sending large numbers of enemy troops. Angered by our army's repeated heavy blows over the past few days, they set fire, and by yesterday afternoon, the fire was still not extinguished. When they rushed out, one of our army's escorting troops was seriously wounded and sacrificed his life in front of the Sihang gate. At 12:00 PM yesterday, the entire battalion transferred to a certain location to rest. Within a short period of time, they will return to their unit and rush to the front line to continue serving the country. The reporter went to a certain location to inquire at 1:00 PM, and returned to the agency at 6:00 PM, and learned of our army's attack and defense situation since the 27th, as follows.

### Situation of Attack and Defense Since the 5th

According to several officers of the said battalion who spoke to the reporter, our army's isolated defense of Zhabei was brief. Having received orders to withdraw, we were deeply grateful for the praise and encouragement from Chinese and foreign circles. We can only repay them by striving forward. Furthermore, compatriots from all quarters generously donated relief goods in countless amounts, for which we feel deeply indebted. We hope that in the future, all sectors will convert the money used to buy relief goods into national salvation bonds, which is no different from killing enemies on the front lines. Since the 27th morning, when our army remained to defend the Sihang Warehouse, the enemy has been attacking day and night. We have long held the belief that we must die, seeking nothing but to fulfill our final responsibility for the country and shed our last drop of blood. On the first morning, the enemy did not know that such a large force was stationed there, so they acted rashly. Several enemies carried enemy flags and climbed onto the roof of the Sihang Warehouse. Our army, with elite troops stationed at the entrance on the second floor, immediately shot and killed them. We then sent a small number of troops to the bottom floor to close the doors and windows tightly. Knowing we were prepared, the enemy poured kerosene and other substances in an attempt to set fire to it, but we had already built solid fortifications there, and the Sihang Warehouse was constructed with steel and concrete, so the enemy's plot failed. They then set up machine guns at the door. Our army had previously set up sentry sandbags there, so the enemy set up machine guns on the sandbags and fired at our roof. Our army swept them away with hand grenades and machine guns, killing three enemies instantly. Afterwards, we did not charge out, and the enemy's machine guns were left there. From then on, they did not dare to drag them away. On the night of the 27th, the enemy tried to sneak around, but we were seriously vigilant and nothing happened.

Building Solid Fortifications the Next Day

The next day, the enemy used flat-trajectory cannons to attack from the Shanghai Bank, the Jiangsu Bank, and the Rui Da Lumber Company, attempting to destroy our fortifications. In addition to using the walls as natural defenses, we also built fortifications to avoid accidents, and set up protective cover on the roof. The enemy attacked many times without success, so they used airplanes to threaten us. Our army, under extremely solid fortifications, fired from high places, killing more than fifty enemies in two days. That evening, we received flags from the City Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts, and after receiving assistance from all sectors, all the comrades in the battalion felt even more excited and courageous. That night, we attacked the enemy with flat-trajectory cannons. At that time, the enemy was already in a helpless situation, so apart from firing machine guns fiercely, the enemy soldiers never dared to approach within fifty meters. On the morning of the 29th, the enemy again used flat-trajectory cannons to specifically target our third floor and the windows of each floor. Our army remained calm as usual, ignoring them. In the evening, our army again displayed its prowess, individually eliminating the enemy's probing troops. By this point, the enemy's deaths and injuries had exceeded sixty or seventy.

Once Charged to the Upper Warehouse

On the 30th, the enemy came up with a hundred plans. In addition to fiercely throwing flat-trajectory cannons, machine guns, and hand grenades, they also planned to attack with yachts on the Suzhou Creek. But we were determined not to be intimidated by this. Many of our comrades searched forward at night. That night, our army even charged to the Shanghai Bank warehouse. The enemy was terrified and did not know what to do. Our purpose was to deplete the enemy's strength, so after charging to the upper warehouse, we reorganized and retreated.

Ordered to Withdraw Late at Night and Early in the Morning

Until after 12:30 am, we suddenly received the withdrawal order from the highest leader, Chairman Chiang. We took obedience to orders as our supreme duty, and killing the enemy is not limited to a specific time or place. At this point, we painfully withdrew from Zhabei. As for Xie and Yang, due to their injuries and having been awake for five days and five nights, they declined all comfort. Although these brave men now have the opportunity to rest, they still hope to immediately return to the front lines to kill the enemy.

Sihang Losses Exceed One Million

Around 7:00 am yesterday, the reporter went to the Jiangyuan Lane area of Xinzha Road and looked north. He saw the Sihang Warehouse still standing on the north bank of Suzhou Creek, but it was empty, increasing people's admiration for the brave men. The western wall of the warehouse was riddled with bullet holes, and several places were pierced through, showing the intensity of the enemy's shelling. The interior of the warehouse after the enemy set it on fire was ablaze, and the burning could still be seen through the bullet holes. The enemy flag had been raised on top of the warehouse, and passersby glanced at it with disapproval. The reporter then learned from related sources that the initial construction cost of the Sihang Warehouse was more than 200,000 yuan. However, after many years, the current estimated value is around 500,000 yuan. The goods piled up in the warehouse were mostly wheat, flour, soybeans, sesame, and the like deposited by grain merchants. The quantity was quite large, worth about one million yuan. However, the Sihang authorities and various grain merchants had all taken out insurance, so the total loss is estimated to be over 1.5 million yuan.

Western Newspaper Reporter's Eyewitness Account

The Da Mei Evening News also published a detailed account written by its reporter, Mr. White, about the Japanese soldiers attacking the mainland warehouse, the Chinese soldiers resisting, and their withdrawal. It stated that after the Chinese soldiers had all withdrawn, we rushed to a certain place to inspect, and the last three trucks had just arrived. We then counted the number of people. There were 377 uninjured people and 26 injured people. There were still several seriously injured people who had been taken to the hospital. The Chinese soldiers withdrew in a blaze of glory, carrying their injured comrades and their bedding. They were all in high spirits, but several people looked worried because several of their comrades had died in the warehouse and their bodies had not been carried out. We gave a young officer a cigarette, and he thanked us humbly. A translator told us that they were stationed there under orders, and they withdrew also under orders. We asked if they were willing to stay longer, and one of them replied that soldiers mainly obey orders. If they were ordered to stay longer, all the comrades would be very willing and would not be afraid.

When the Japanese army attacked, several bullets hit the nearby water and fire company. The company had 100,000 cubic meters of gas stored, and if it exploded, the consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, the withdrawal of the Chinese soldiers was not only ordered by the highest authorities, but also earnestly requested by the concession authorities.

Congratulatory Telegram from the Korean Revolutionary Party

To Director Xie and Battalion Commander Yang of the Shenbao Hall's 88th Division, and all the loyal and brave soldiers: The Japanese bandits are rampant, invading China. Their atrocities and aggression are resented by both gods and men. Since the August 13th Incident, your country's troops have bravely resisted the war and repeatedly defeated stubborn enemies. Your divine might has spread, and the world is shocked. In this major battle, there was an occasional setback. Strategically, the battle lines were temporarily moved. However, your regiment's soldiers, with eight hundred isolated troops, defended a corner to the death, fighting on scorched earth for four days and nights, securing the final stronghold. They were willing to make heroic sacrifices to fulfill the duties of a soldier and protect the glory of their motherland. Now, they have obeyed the orders of the highest leader, enduring the pain of retreat, escaping the encirclement, and gaining safety to continue their efforts to repay the country. The righteous and great spirit of all the officers and soldiers is unprecedented in ancient and modern times, and rarely seen in the world. Our party comrades have heard and seen it with our own eyes, and we are moved to tears. We hereby send a telegram to express our respect. Shanghai Special Zone of the Korean National Revolutionary Party, October 31st.

Headquarters Commends Brave Soldier Director Xie

According to the Central News Agency, the brave soldiers under Director Xie, who vowed to defend the last position in Zhabei to the death, have been bravely entrenched in the Sihang Warehouse since the 27th of last month, fighting fiercely under the encirclement of artillery fire for four days, earning worldwide admiration. Yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, they painfully withdrew under orders from the highest leader, and gathered in a safe area in the afternoon. All sectors admired the brave soldiers' loyalty and offered condolences. The General Headquarters, recognizing that the regiment's loyal and brave resistance had brought glory to the country, specially rewarded them with 3,000 yuan and promoted each of them by one rank to show commendation. Generous compensation will also be given to those who died and were injured. Before the regiment withdrew, the enemy claimed to launch a general attack, besieging them with fierce artillery fire for about five hours, but ultimately failed. About twenty minutes after the regiment safely withdrew, seeing no movement, the enemy began to probe and enter, searching each floor and then setting it on fire. After daybreak, the reporter went to inspect. Although the brave soldiers had lowered the flag and retreated, the building still stood majestically. The western wall was riddled with bullet holes and flames were bursting out. Recalling the heroic posture of our brave soldiers fighting the enemy on the roof the other day, I couldn't help but feel saddened.

Promoted One Rank and Awarded Medals

According to the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 31st, when our army shifted its position, our 524th Regiment was ordered to provide cover in Zhabei. When the mission was accomplished, the enemy troops had tracked and pursued them. Regiment Commander Han Xianyuan led two battalions to resist step by step, and has not yet returned to the team. His regimental deputy, Xie Jinyuan, led officers and soldiers to retreat to the Sihang Warehouse, fighting the enemy for four days, repeatedly killing stubborn enemies, which aroused the admiration of Chinese and foreign people. On the morning of the 31st, they were ordered to withdraw. It was also heard that Chairman Chiang was deeply pleased with the officers and soldiers of the regiment deputy Xie Jinyuan and below, who carried out their duties and achieved their goals. He specially issued an order to all troops to promote each officer and soldier of the regiment by one rank, and requested the government to grant them honorary medals. As for the whereabouts of Protector Commander Han Xianyuan and other officers and soldiers and the deceased, they have been identified and will be submitted to the government separately for rewards and generous pensions to comfort the loyal souls and reward the meritorious.

At 3:00 AM on the 28th, more than one thousand enemies launched a strong attack on a certain brigade of our central unit, using various weapons in combination, and some used tunnels to secretly approach. Our defending soldiers were thin, and reinforcements could not arrive in time, so the situation was very dangerous. After a brave counterattack, more than 200 enemies were killed, and more than ten rifles, as well as diaries, maps, and notebooks, were obtained. Our officers and soldiers suffered more than fifty casualties. Around 2:00 PM, the enemy launched a fierce attack on a certain division's two brigades. The momentum was very strong.

[Taiyuan] According to the military news received by officials here today, the Japanese army's attempt to reopen the transportation line between Jinbei and its rear was defeated by the Chinese ××× army, and they溃逃 towards Datong and Zhangjiakou. It is said that the farmers in Hebei and Shanxi, inspired by the ××× army's fierce anti-Japanese propaganda, have spontaneously risen up to resist the Japanese army's invasion. Whether in steep mountains or in any location, they have attacked the Japanese army and destroyed its baggage trains and vehicles, which has been of great help to the ××× army's operations. Now, summarizing the war news from various sources in the past ten days, it is briefly described as follows: On October 19, when a large Japanese army attacked Guangling, the ××× army was driven to the nearby mountains. There were often five Japanese planes and twenty tanks attacking the Chinese army. After three days and three nights of fierce fighting, on October 24, the ×× army received a large number of reinforcements and defeated the Japanese army. The Japanese army then retreated to Guangling and tried to close the city gates tightly. However, the Chinese army guerrillas had ambushed in the city, causing fierce street fighting. By October 25, Guangling was completely occupied. At the same time, another detachment of the ××× army attacked Lingqiu to the south. The Mongolian puppet army defending the city resisted slightly and fled to Hunyuan. After the ×× army occupied Guangling, they left a part to guard it and sent a large unit to advance northeastward, crossing the Hebei-Chahar border and occupying Weixian County in Chahar. During the occupation of Weixian County, there was also fierce street fighting with the Japanese army and the Mongolian puppet army. The Japanese and puppet armies could not hold out and fled towards Zhangjiakou. A detachment of the Chinese army occupied Qingfengdian, south of Baoding, on the 26th. Now, the ×× army's positions have been greatly expanded. Places such as Weixian County in Chahar, Laiyuan in Hebei, and Lingshou, 20 miles northwest of Shijiazhuang, are all within its defensive range. The highway from Datong to Taiyuan, the highway from Guangling to Xiaguan Town, and the Yanmen Pass, the throat of Jinbei, are now all held in common. (30th National Telegram)

More people moved out yesterday than the day before.

### Detailed Record of Enemy Aircraft's Frenzied Bombing of Songjiang for Two Days

Songjiang, 31st telegram. It has already been reported in this newspaper that this area was subjected to indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft on the 28th and 29th of this month, and the prosperous areas were completely destroyed. Now, in order to understand the actual situation of the bombing and all the details of the local area, our reporter made a special trip to the urban and rural areas for an on-the-spot investigation. It was found that the most prosperous West Gate Street in this area, except for the area east of Qianjing Bridge, west of Baojia Bridge, and the newly widened Changqiao Street, which was bombed into rubble on the 24th, almost all of the shops and residences from the West City Gate and outside the city to the Malu Bridge were destroyed. However, most of them were destroyed in the裹埭 (wrapped in soil), so the facades are still quite intact. It was found that the shops in this section are all relatively large firms in Songjiang, and the four banks of China, Farmers, Pawn Industry, and Xinhua, as well as the two money houses of Chengda and Yukang, and the two pawnshops of Quand and Henghe, were all established in this section, and the losses are particularly high. To the west of Malu Bridge, the Kang Yongchu family, the Jiang family of the 缸甏 (jars and vats) store, Du Jintai of Xiuye Bridge, and the vicinity of the 痧神廟 (Goddess of Measles Temple) were all bombed. The bombing of Du Jintai was the worst. To the west of the Pagoda Bridge, the

Mu Wei Girls' School, run by the American Christian Church in Jiuqu Lane, was hit by a shell and caught fire. The fire was fierce, but fortunately, the neighbors on all sides were not affected. At the same time, the Shangsong Bus Station south of the Magao Bridge and the West City Gate also caught fire. The fire at the West Gate was the most intense. At that time, there was a strong north wind, making it even more difficult to extinguish. Other places, such as Black Fish Lane, Mo Jia Lane, Yangjia Bridge, Miaoyan Temple, Shihui Bridge, Zhuhang Street, Gao Jia Lane, Houzhuhang Street, Zhugan Hui, Yangjia Lane, etc., were also bombed. The main hall of the Yue Temple, which had just been rebuilt with funds raised from the Taoist temples, was also completely destroyed. When the shells hit the West City Gate, dozens of pedestrians were hiding inside the city gate opening. Seven or eight people were killed and dozens injured by shrapnel. Heads were missing and feet broken, a truly tragic sight. Even more shells hit the city. From the West Gate to Yangjia Bridge, more than a dozen shells hit the upper and lower embankments. The destruction of the Dahua Printing Bureau was the worst. Further east, from the entrance of Socks Lane to the end of Center Lane,

### Tragic Scene of People's Homes Bombed in Songjiang

— (War Shadow Team Photo)

All Houses are Completely Destroyed. Among them, the section from in front of the Court to the end of Center Lane, because it had been bombed once before, after being bombed again this time, the houses completely collapsed and became a rubble field. In the south of the County Government, the south of the Court, the south of the Inspection Yard, the Lu Jia Bridge in the South Inner City, Qiu Jia Wan (Zhengxin Middle School, run by the Catholic Church, was also destroyed), and other small streets, one or two shells fell. In short, 70% of the main streets and small alleys outside the west and inside the city were hit by shells and bombed. Everywhere you look, it is a scene of desolation. The essence of Songjiang has been damaged by 60% or 70%. The number of dead and injured is no less than 200 people. The Songjiang Red Cross will find ways to rescue and bury them. All the shops are now closed. Poor people even have money but nowhere to buy rice and are suffering from hunger. The inhumanity of the Japanese pirates is enough to arouse the outrage of the world. As for the local authorities, except for Commissioner Wang of the Special Office, who is still leading his subordinates to work as usual in the original place and is working hard, the rest have moved to other places. The doctors in the hospitals are also scattered and the hospital services have been suspended. Therefore, after this incident, the Red Cross Society alone maintained all rescue and burial work. However, because the hospitals have moved or closed, the rescue team

Risking Their Lives to Go to the Bombed Areas for Rescue, after escaping danger, they felt deeply troubled because there was nowhere to send the wounded for treatment. Fortunately, the Director of the Society, Mr. Zhou Xuewen, led his subordinates to work hard, and even in the midst of extremely difficult circumstances, he never turned back and completed his mission. At present, 70% or 80% of the people in Songjiang have fled to other places, and only a small number of poor people are left. As for the local newspapers, because the Jinwen and Dahua printing presses were completely bombed and the Chengzhang printing press was also damaged by the shock, they have all been shut down, which has affected the printing of the newspapers, so they have all temporarily suspended publication. (Another report) An enemy plane flew over Songjiang for reconnaissance at around 2:00 PM on the 30th, and after circling in the city for two weeks, it flew to the northwest and dropped two shells each in the center of the two towns of Chenfang Bridge and Maihua Bridge. It is reported that many houses were destroyed and the number of casualties is still being investigated.

### The Spirit of Resilient Warfare

The enemy has captured Dachang and Niangziguan, thinking that they can easily take Shanghai and Taiyuan. But our brave soldiers retreated to new defense lines, fighting with even greater spirit. They are determined to defend Shanghai and Taiyuan, not only not allowing the enemy to advance another step, but also taking advantage of any opportunity to attack the enemy's lines.

This spirit of resilient warfare is the most valuable and commendable. Its effects are already evident. In the Shanghai theater, in the past two months, the enemy did not expect our army to be so resilient in combat, and their offensive plans failed many times. In the end, they had to risk extremely heavy sacrifices and adopt a roundabout assault strategy. However, our defenders in Zhabei still withdrew as an entire division. The enemy only gained a scorched earth in Zhabei, which can by no means compensate for the cost of many bloody battles. In the Shanxi theater, the enemy broke through the Yanmen Pass, but suffered repeated defeats. Now, the main force of the enemy in the Xinkou area is trapped in a predicament of advancing or retreating. And the enemy forces advancing from eastern Shanxi are still facing enemies on all sides. In any case, up to now, the situation in both theaters is extremely optimistic. And the main factor that makes it optimistic is the resilient spirit shown by our troops.

As everyone knows, our final victory can only be achieved through a protracted war of resistance. I believe that the strategy adopted by our military authorities must also maintain the spirit of resilient warfare as the first priority.

### The United States Intensifies Its Rearmament Plan

Orders 270 "Flying Fortresses," Plans to Build 1,800 Military Aircraft, Roosevelt Again Rejects Militarism

[Washington] The United States' rearmament plan has recently been intensified. The Navy Department announced today that the government's order for 270 "Flying Fortresses" has been put out to tender, with a total cost of over US$200 million. At the same time, a spokesman for the Army Department also announced a plan to build 1,800 new military aircraft, with a budget that is expected to be completed by the end of 1938. At that time, the number of military aircraft in the United States will double. The Treasury Department stated that this year's national defense expenditure has increased by 10% compared to last year, and slightly exceeds President Roosevelt's budget. Since July 1, the expenditure has been 303,497,264 yuan, compared to 20,704,258 yuan at the same time last year. (30th National Telegram)

⊙New York Sea Defense Park. President Roosevelt today cited the peaceful relations between the North and South American countries as a model for the abolition of war throughout the world. The President told representatives of a women's organization that the peace in the Americas was created by treaties and arbitration. Other countries have also gradually realized that international disputes can be resolved without the use of force. Therefore, the influence of the Americas on the world is very far-reaching. At present, some countries still have hostile attitudes towards each other, and the problem lies in their inability to abide by treaties like the American countries. (30th National Telegram)

### British Newspaper Comments on the Prospects of the Brussels Conference

Expresses Satisfaction with U.S. Active Action, German Foreign Minister States Reasons for Not Attending

[London] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, The Times and The Observer commented on it separately, with different views. The Times expressed satisfaction that the United States did not participate in the conference as an observer, but actively participated as a member. It also stated that after the establishment of peace in the Far East, European countries, which love peace, can devote their full attention to the European situation, and European peace can be encouraged. The reason why other countries try to delay or hinder peace in the Far East also lies in this. The Observer said that "European countries' talk of peace plans for the Far East situation is laughable. As the saying goes, good deeds should start with enjoying oneself. Peace is the same as good deeds. If European peace is not achieved through the efforts of European countries, it will be difficult to contribute to peace in the Far East. (31st Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

⊙Munich. German Foreign Minister Neurath delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the German Academy of Law today, elaborating on Germany's attitude towards the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. First, he analyzed the views of group politics, and then stated that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was a practical opportunity for Councillor to resolve international disputes. Germany did not accept the invitation because the conference was convened using the provisions of the 1922 Nine-Power Treaty. Since Germany is not a signatory country, it cannot be expected to participate. However, the reply clearly stated that when the time is ripe and the main conditions are met, Germany is willing to participate in the cooperation to mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict at any time. Regarding the prospects of this meeting, Neurath declared that when the League of Nations convened this meeting, the elements of group politics it contained were very few, and its progress may not be very smooth. I believe that no matter what attitude each country takes towards the Sino-Japanese conflict, it is difficult to achieve the purpose of mediation if they are in the position of moral judges when mediating the war.

### Conflict Erupts Again on the Russian-Manchukuo Border

Soviet Russia Protests to Japan

[Moscow] Boli reports that on the 28th of this month, a unit of Japanese and puppet troops invaded the Soviet border six kilometers northwest of Bashi Koli Village in the Boxiai area, and opened fire on the Soviet border guards who were heading towards the border.

### Belgian New Cabinet Difficult to Produce

Former Foreign Minister Spaak Expected to Succeed as Prime Minister

⊙Brussels. Since the resignation of former Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland, no new government has been formed. Former Socialist Finance Minister De Man was commissioned to form a cabinet on Friday, but later gave up because the Liberal Party refused to cooperate. Socialist stalwart Vandeville also refused to form a cabinet before. However, the whole country hopes that a new government can be formed before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (30th Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)

⊙Brussels. After the failure of former Finance Minister De Man to form a cabinet, King Leopold III appointed right-wing Senator Obanpe to form a cabinet, but Obanpe has declined. It is now generally believed that the King will ask former Foreign Minister Spaak, a member of the Socialist Party, to form a new cabinet. It is likely that Spaak will accept and the new cabinet is expected to be formed, because the Liberal Party has a better impression of Spaak than De Man. If Spaak refuses to form a cabinet, someone from outside the parliament will be asked to form a cabinet. (31st Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

### Japan-Italy Negotiations

Joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, Italy Has Not Yet Expressed Its Position

[Rome]

Regarding Italy's joining the anti-communist agreement between Germany and Japan, observers generally believe that, as of now, there has been no official expression that would lead one to believe that it is immediately possible. As for those responsible in Japan and Italy, they have consistently refused to release any information. Furthermore, before Japan's former ambassador to Italy, Sugimura Yotaro, was transferred to be the ambassador to France, he negotiated and concluded a commercial treaty between Italy and Japan with the Italian government. However, this commercial treaty has not yet been signed. Therefore, some people believe that the reason for the delay in signing the commercial treaty may be due to the fact that Rome and Tokyo are currently negotiating a political treaty, so the commercial treaty will be concluded at the same time as the political treaty is established. However, whether Italy will only participate in the anti-communist agreement between Germany and Japan, or conclude a separate agreement with Japan, is unknown to political figures. According to reports, when the anti-communist agreement between Germany and Japan was established last year, Italy was unwilling to join the agreement. Later, Italy changed its attitude and expressed its willingness to participate in the agreement at the beginning of this year. However, Japan suddenly expressed its unwillingness again. However, recently, as the situation in the Far East has evolved, the relationship between Japan and Italy has become increasingly close, so even if a political agreement is established between the two countries, it will not add anything to the actual relationship between the two countries. (31st Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

[Tokyo] Asahi Shimbun has learned that Italy will join the anti-communist agreement between Japan and Germany. A complete agreement has now been reached between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Italy has abandoned its proposal to establish a separate bilateral agreement. The draft of the three-nation anti-communist agreement will be discussed at the next meeting of the Privy Council. This three-nation agreement can be formally announced in early November. At that time, the agreement will be signed in Rome by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop, and Japanese Minister to Switzerland Horita Masaaki.

⊙Valencia. Spanish Prime Minister Negrín departed from here by plane today to Barcelona.

### Italy Suddenly Recalls Ambassador to France

European Speculation Uneasy

[Paris] Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti formally notified the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he had received instructions from his government to grant him "leave" to return home. Cerruti is scheduled to depart tomorrow afternoon and return to Rome. According to Italian sources here, the ambassador's leave is quite lengthy. The French generally believe that this move by the Italian government is to put its diplomatic representatives in France on an equal footing with the French diplomatic representatives in Italy, because after the retirement of former French Ambassador to Italy Chambrun a year ago, the government appointed Saint-Quentin, Director of the African Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to succeed him, and sought the consent of the Italian government. Although Italy agreed, it requested that the salutation on the new ambassador's credentials must use the words "His Majesty the King of Italy, Emperor of Abyssinia." France, in its capacity as a member of the League of Nations, found it difficult to accept this, so the Chargé d'affaires of the Embassy in Italy, Bérongtair, has been acting as the Chargé d'affaires to this day. (30th Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

[London] The sudden recall of the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerruti, has caused speculation in various European countries, and Paris is particularly surprised. According to the official explanation in Paris, this move by Italy is due to the lack of a French ambassador in Rome. Since the retirement of the French Ambassador to Italy, Chambrun, last year, there has been no successor, and if France has to send an ambassador to Italy, it must recognize Italy as the Emperor of Abyssinia. There is also a saying that the speeches made by important figures at the rally of the Radical Socialist Party in Le Rée on Friday have greatly angered Mussolini, but this theory cannot be established now, because the speeches had not yet been conveyed to Rome when the Italian ambassador was recalled. At the Radical Socialist Party congress, former Prime Minister Herriot hinted at ominous developments in Africa and asked, "Who knows that the flag hanging in Palma is the Spanish flag." At the same time, Foreign Minister Terbos compared the incidents in Manchuria and Abyssinia, saying that the violation of treaties has emboldened imperialism and made the threatened countries more uneasy. Unofficially in Rome, it is believed that the recall of the ambassador is due to the gradual deterioration of friendship between the two countries over the past year, and it is felt that the current state of bad feelings between France and Italy has reached the extreme after the visit of French Foreign Minister Laval to Italy in 1935. However, officially, it is only said that Cerruti's return home is because Cerruti wants to spend his Christmas holidays in Rome. Furthermore, there are rumors that there will be a large-scale change of Italian diplomats, and Cerruti is intended to be given other appointments, while the Embassy in France will be headed by the Chargé d'affaires.

### Bulgarian King and Queen Visit France and England

Politically Significant

[London] Bulgarian King Boris and Queen arrived in Paris this morning, and are scheduled to arrive in England for a visit this evening. King Boris's trip has political significance, and he will hold talks with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden to explain Bulgaria's foreign policy. It is heard that this policy is purely based on historical viewpoints and geographical relations. Although it does not participate in the Balkan Accord group, it will also maintain a detached position towards the political axis formed by Italy and Germany. According to reports, the United Kingdom has latent influence on the Balkan countries in spirit, which can prevent these countries from being attracted by the Soviet Union or being brought under the control of the political axis of Italy and Germany. This can be seen from King Boris's visit to the United Kingdom. (31st Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

### Municipal Organizations' Meeting Issues Declaration and Telegram on Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Expressing Solemn Positions Based on the Spirit of the Treaty

Central News Agency reports: The Municipal Anti-Enemy Support Association, in view of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be held in Brussels on the third of this month, regarding whether this conference will have satisfactory results, is a major turning point for world peace and the blessings and woes of humanity. Therefore, the Association convened a joint meeting of over a hundred representatives from the city's industry, commerce, women, culture, and various national salvation organizations the day before yesterday to conduct a comprehensive review of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Several important proposals were decided on the spot and have been reported in various newspapers. The association specifically issued a declaration yesterday, expressing solemn positions based on the spirit of the treaty, and sent telegrams to the whole country to rise up and strive together. It also appointed nine representatives to deliver letters to the consulates of various countries in the city, requesting each to telegraph its government to uphold the treaty's consistent position. The declaration and telegram, etc., are listed separately below:

Declaration: We believe that only by guaranteeing international peace can human well-being be developed, and only by respecting international treaties can world peace be guaranteed. Therefore, any country that violates treaties and arbitrarily commits aggression is not only a major disaster in one area but also an enemy of humanity. Because peace is complete and indivisible, in the current stage of intricate and closely related international political economy, even a single strand can affect the whole body, and the disaster of a prairie fire, if not extinguished early, will not only cause China to suffer miserably, but also the friendly nations directly or indirectly related to the Pacific will inevitably suffer unpredictable and terrible consequences. Since the "September 18th" Northeast Incident, the enemy has been barbaric and unscrupulous, advancing step by step. The bullying and oppression we have suffered from Japanese imperialism in recent years are all performances of their consistent continental monopolization policy. Their purpose is not only to damage China's sovereignty and plunder China's territory, but also to destroy the entire China, then dominate East Asia, and threaten Europe and the United States. At that time, in order to trust and abide by the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, we temporarily tolerated and did not argue, expecting righteous condemnation and effective sanctions. At the same time, we hoped that in the difficult and arduous situation, we would unify the interior, develop resources, and devote ourselves to economic and cultural construction, sharing the interests of all mankind, as a pillar of world peace. But the facts tell us that these expectations have gradually faded due to the enemy's continuous attacks and various forms of indulgence and perfunctory treatment. The dignity of the treaty has been submerged by the enemy's artillery fire, and international peace has been trampled by the enemy's muddy feet. The enemy's provocations from the Lugou Bridge to the Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai have created a situation in which the Chinese nation is fighting a full-scale war of resistance. No one can imagine its future, but we will never waver or succumb to any situation. Although we are a nation that loves peace and values ​​trustworthiness, we cannot but fight for survival, and we cannot but fight to protect the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which is to say that we cannot but fight for international peace and human justice. Now the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, convened by the resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly, will open in Brussels on November 3, in order to resolve the disputes between the two countries based on the principles of the treaty and to seek the re-establishment of world peace. We express our infinite gratitude and joy for the good intentions and efforts of the friendly nations. Although some people doubt its future, we cannot but recognize its importance and pay close attention to it. Since this conference is based on the Nine-Power Treaty, it should undoubtedly fulfill the obligations of the treaty without compromise and promote the spirit of the treaty. The first principle of the treaty is to "respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China." The second is to "give China the fullest and most unfettered opportunity to develop and maintain a strong and consolidated government." Japan is one of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. From the moral and legal point of view, it should abide by this principle unswervingly. Unfortunately, the enemy's acts of aggression and violence over the past few years have completely torn up the treaty in fact. Therefore, we have the following requirements for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference: First, the League of Nations has resolved to prove that Japan has destroyed the treaty and invaded China. Then this conference should take the same action as the League of Nations and declare Japan as a country that violates the treaty and behaves aggressively. Second, according to the first principle of the treaty, Japan should be ordered to fulfill the obligations stipulated by the treaty, that is, to immediately withdraw all naval, land, and air forces in China back to Japan, and to abolish all false organizations that undermine China's sovereignty, independence, and administrative integrity. Third, any international treaty or agreement that violates the principles of the treaty should be declared invalid. Fourth, if the violating country does not fulfill all the resolutions to uphold the treaty, the participating countries should, together with the member states of the League of Nations, promptly impose collective and effective sanctions, that is, sever diplomatic, commercial, and financial relations with Japan. If it is still ineffective, then use force to stop Japan's acts of aggression. Fifth, the participating countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and the member states of the League of Nations should give China substantial assistance, such as supplying military supplies and raw materials, and not prohibit their own people from participating in the Chinese army service and similar acts. Sixth, this conference should expand the original treaty, add mutual assistance clauses and sanction clauses, and stipulate the establishment of a permanent supervision and enforcement mechanism, so as to expand it into a general collective security treaty for the Pacific. The signatory countries should include all countries in East Asia or the Pacific that have vested interests. The above six points are our firm demands, and at the same time, they are the only way to maintain international peace. If it is just passive dredging and weak condemnation, the outcome of the conference will be tantamount to destroying its own position and fueling the enemy's ferocity. Although we love peace very much, we dare not agree with it. It must be known that China is a country that has been invaded, and most of its territory has been plundered by the enemy. National sovereignty and national survival are being persecuted in an unprecedented way. The question now is not how to stop the war, but what reasonable and thorough methods can be used to eradicate the war in the Far East. China is forced to fight, and is struggling painfully under the sword and chain. This war of self-defense will never end until sovereignty and independence, territorial integrity, and national survival are effectively guaranteed. In other words, our only purpose is to practice the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, to restore the original state of sovereignty, independence, territorial and administrative integrity, and to establish a treaty and mechanism for collective security in the Pacific. What is needed is permanent peace, not temporary peace, and glorious peace, not humiliating peace. The countries that convened and participated in this conference have always had sincere friendship with China, and they must also feel the threat of Japanese aggression deeply. If the treaty can be overthrown arbitrarily and justice can be discarded arbitrarily, then the Japanese ferocity will destroy the entire world, and those who suffer from it will not be limited to China. This is what we hope that friendly nations will be wary of in advance and prevent. Finally, we hope that our government and all compatriots will promote the success of the conference in a revolutionary diplomatic manner and give a serious blow to the invaders who violate the treaty.

Telegram: To all national agencies, organizations, newspapers, schools, and all overseas embassies and consulates, and all overseas Chinese, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which was passed by the League of Nations General Assembly, is about to open in Brussels. No one can predict the outcome at this time, but the nature of the conference is convened because Japan has destroyed the treaty, so all claims and resolutions should be based on the principle of "respecting China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity" in the treaty, and strive to implement it actively in order to maintain the dignity of the treaty and to give weight to international credibility. Since the loss of the four northeastern provinces, Japanese imperialists have attacked Suiyuan and Chahar, ravaged eastern Hebei, used traitors and bandits, engaged in insidious plots of encroachment, and arbitrarily trafficked drugs and smuggled goods, destroying our people's lives, and recently intensified their efforts to forcibly seize Hebei by force, attacking Shanghai. Planes and artillery bombarded indiscriminately, cultural institutions have been destroyed, and women and children seeking refuge have been killed and bled. Their intention is not only to destroy China, but to dominate Asia, and covet Europe and the United States. If this continues to be rampant, it will inevitably lead to a world war and leave endless disasters for mankind. Our purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China. At this time of peace, despair, and national crisis, there is no way to protect survival without resistance, and there is no way to win a glorious victory without resisting to the end. The Nine-Power Treaty was originally established to promote international justice and protect peace in the Far East. All signatory countries have the obligation to fulfill it. Now Japanese imperialists, regardless of everything, take the lead in destroying it. In their minds, they have long despised justice and are willing to be the leader of bandits and international robbers. It is impossible to talk about reconciliation, and it is impossible for reconciliation to be effective. Since the League of Nations has proved that Japan has destroyed the treaty and invaded China, this conference should take the same action as the League of Nations and declare Japan as an aggressor and a violator of the treaty, ordering Japan to abide by all the provisions of the treaty, and withdrawing all naval, land, and air forces in China back to Japan within a time limit, and abolishing all false organizations that undermine China's sovereignty, independence, and administrative integrity. Any treaty or agreement that violates the spirit of the treaty should be declared invalid. If Japan still ignores this resolution and goes its own way, the participating countries should, together with the member states of the League of Nations, sever diplomatic, commercial, and financial relations with Japan. If it is still ineffective, then swords and shoes should be used immediately to implement military sanctions, and provide China with material, financial, and human assistance. In addition, we believe that in this conference, the Nine-Power Treaty should be supplemented, adding mutual assistance and sanction clauses, and stipulating the establishment of a permanent supervisory and enforcement agency, so as to be passed down as a collective security treaty and mechanism for the Pacific. All the above are our necessary claims, and they are a permanent guarantee for peace in the Far East. It must be known that this war is China's last war. Life and death are of great importance. There is a self-confidence in winning victory, and there is a spirit of no compromise. There is a determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and the nation has hope of revival. All measures taken to reconcile and compromise, hoping to seek temporary peace and self-interest, and to damage China's sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity, we, for the sake of the future of the nation, have no choice but to refuse resolutely without being intimidated. The opportunity is urgent. We hereby appeal to our elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters to rise up together, use all means to run around and shout to show the true intentions of the people, and to promote the vigilance of friendly nations. The telegraph is endless. Shanghai Municipal Joint Conference of Various Groups bows to the world.

Visit: The meeting had previously decided to send representatives to visit the consuls of various countries in the city to deliver letters, requesting them to telegraph their respective governments to uphold the treaty and unanimously advocate sanctions against Japan. The delegation has appointed Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Tong Xingzi, Liu Zhanen, Xu Xinliu, Yan Fuqing, and Zhu Shaoping as nine representatives, and scheduled to visit the consuls of various countries in Shanghai today and deliver letters, requesting them to convey the opinions of the citizens of this city on the Nine-Power Treaty and the wishes of the governments of friendly nations.

### Young Air Force Reconnaissance Officer Yun Yi'an Sacrifices for the Country

Engaged in a fierce battle with a large enemy aircraft formation on the Tongpu Northern Line in Shanxi Province, wounded, broke through and crash-landed in Huoxian County after exhausting all strength

Yun Yi'an, a young air force reconnaissance officer, was ordered to join the battle in Shanxi Province and died for his country on October 15. At that time, due to brief telegrams and delayed mail, there was no way to know the details. Yesterday, his brother Yun Yiduo obtained a letter from his family from his hometown, describing the circumstances of his martyrdom. It is specially recorded as follows: Martyr Yun Yi'an was from Wujin, Jiangsu. In the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he was admitted to the Central Aviation School and graduated in the summer of the 24th year. He served in the Nanjing Aviation Committee and the Hangzhou alma mater. Later, he entered the advanced reconnaissance class of the Nanjing Aviation Committee for further study. Last year, he was selected to enter the Army-Air Force Liaison Reconnaissance Class of the Central Army Officer Training Class. He graduated in July this year and was assigned to the Air Force No. ×× Team. When the "August 13" Shanghai battle broke out, he was transferred to Nanjing from ×× to participate in the Eastern Battlefield campaign. In early September, he was transferred from Nanjing to ××, and fought on the Pinghan Line and Jin Sui. On October 15, while conducting reconnaissance on the Tongpu Northern Line, he encountered a large enemy aircraft formation and created an enemy defense. He was wounded and flew south, and crash-landed in Huoxian County after exhausting all strength. His remains were coffined and buried by the local authorities and have been transported to Luoyang. The martyr was only twenty-three years old. He was silent and liked to study tirelessly. He always had a book in his hand and had absolutely no juvenile habits. Before entering the officer training class and after graduating from the training class, his family urged him to get married twice, but the martyr refused with "How can I have a home before the Huns are destroyed?" The villagers and relatives all expected him to become a great talent, but his great ambitions have not been fulfilled and he has died for the country, and they all feel regret. His father, Mr. Xuan Shu, is over sixty years old. Although he comforted himself and others with "It is the glory of the family to have a son like this" when he heard the bad news, he could not help but shed tears and his heart was overwhelmed with grief. It is now decided by the family to establish a school in Changcheng with the martyr's pension, etc., as a permanent memorial.

### Those Who Are Enthusiastic About Purchasing Public Bonds Are Prepared to Request Rewards

Detailed Reports from Individuals and Organizations, Compiling Calculations, Creating Registers, and Requesting Rewards

The General Association of the National Salvation Public Bond Fundraising Committee issued Announcement No. 11 yesterday, stating: "The regulations and grading methods for rewarding the purchase of national salvation public bonds have been promulgated by order of the National Government and distributed by this association for inspection. This association should forward those compatriots at home and abroad who enthusiastically contribute and purchase bonds in accordance with the reward regulations and methods to the National Government for awards in accordance with the regulations in order to show encouragement and to promote the code of honor. However, although this association has ledgers that can be consulted for the bond funds that have already been purchased, it is difficult to compile statistics on the rewards that purchasers should receive because purchasers may pay in installments, or may be in professional teams, or may purchase more than once, or may be contracted in more than one place, resulting in separate collections and separate accounts. For this reason, a public announcement is made that all people from all walks of life, whether individuals or organizations, who have installment payments or payments made in different places, and who consider that the total amount of purchases meets the reward regulations and methods, should quickly submit the name, place of origin, address, payment date, receiving agency, and the number of the public bond receipt they hold, and report it to this association for compilation, calculation, creation of registers, and request for rewards. It is hoped that you will do so. This is a special announcement."

Special Group: The First Special Grade Group of the Citizens' Fundraising Team for National Salvation Public Bonds has continued to receive reports from various teams on the results of their fundraising as follows: First Team, 875 yuan; Fourth Team, 1002 yuan and 48 cents; Eighth Team, 1300 yuan; Fourteenth Team, 270 yuan; Twenty-first Team, 763 yuan and 20 cents; Sixth Special Team, 17,940 yuan. The group is urging the remaining unpaid teams separately in order to compile them and submit them to the general team for the fourth time.

Traditional Chinese Medicine Community: Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, members of the traditional Chinese medicine community have been extremely enthusiastic about the patriotic movement. They have organized rescue teams to go to the front lines. Captain Xu led the team members to participate in the work of national salvation and the results are remarkable. The China Traditional Chinese Medicine Association purchased 4,000 yuan of national salvation public bonds from its public reserve fund, and the Shanghai Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Association purchased 1,000 yuan from its construction fund. Other doctors have purchased a total of more than 30,000 yuan. A local association recently launched a campaign to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers in the north, and the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association recognized a loss of 2,000 yuan, which was sent to the local association for joint delivery yesterday.

YMCA: The Shanghai YMCA previously launched a campaign to raise national salvation public bonds, and raised 100,000 yuan in less than two weeks, reaching its expected goal. Now the association has launched a campaign to raise reserve funds for national salvation public bonds, and has organized 100 fundraising teams, which are scheduled to start today and end at the end of this month. The estimated goal is 10,000 households. The fundraising methods are as follows: (A) Each household deposits at least one yuan to open a savings book. (B) Thereafter, deposits can be made continuously, regardless of the amount, until five yuan is deposited, and then national salvation public bonds can be exchanged. (C) Anyone who deposits five yuan or more at a time is also counted as one household and can receive a national salvation public bond receipt and a savings book. (D) The money can be sent directly by the fundraiser or the depositor to the Shanghai YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge or the Central Trust Bureau on Albert Road for payment and receipt of the savings book. (E) After the depositor receives the savings book, the fundraiser must still encourage continued deposits as much as possible to fulfill the original intention of the public bond savings. (F) If the fundraiser has money in hand, please pay it to the Trust Bureau immediately to clear the procedures. The YMCA also held a tea party at 2:00 pm yesterday to invite the captains to report everything, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 pm.

Christians: Since the Shanghai Christian Association launched a campaign to raise national salvation public bonds, it has been progressing smoothly. Various churches in the city have established fundraising teams to actively promote it. According to news from Moore Church on Sanma Road, as of yesterday, the church had more than 4,270 yuan in subscriptions. The results of other churches are also considerable and are still actively raising funds.

### Memorial of the Death of Mr. Huang Keqiang

Various Groups on Two Roads Hold Memorial Ceremony

The Two Roads Party Department, the Two Roads Anti-Enemy Support Association, and the Two Roads Labor Union and other organizations held a memorial service for the death of Mr. Huang Keqiang at 10:00 am on the 31st of this month in the temporary auditorium of the Party Department. More than 60 representatives participated. Chairman Li Dasan, member of the Standing Committee, presided over the ceremony. After performing the ceremony as usual, the chairman gave a report, which roughly stated that Mr. Keqiang followed the Premier and dedicated himself to the revolution. Not only was his history long, but his achievements were also great. He had always studied military and political affairs and had his own ideas. He participated in various uprisings and was able to defeat the majority of the Manchu Qing forces with a small number of revolutionary forces. Now, at the time of the full-scale war of resistance, we must use Mr. Keqiang's spirit of fearlessness of death and revolutionary tactics to deal with the Japanese invaders, so that we can achieve the final victory and complete Mr. Keqiang's legacy. Then, Standing Committee Member Song Chuanji gave a speech (omitted). The meeting ended at 11:00 am.

### Anti-Enemy Association Sets Deadline for Exchanging Official Receipts

At 133 Edward Road, Failure to Exchange After Deadline Will Disqualify Receipt of Public Bonds

The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Anti-Enemy Support Association issued an announcement yesterday regarding the exchange of official receipts for national salvation donations: "The national salvation donations raised by this association were entrusted to various banks and newspapers in the city for collection. Initially, due to the inability to print official receipts in time for application, some donations were only given temporary receipts by the Bank of China and newspapers. It has been announced in newspapers and urged to exchange the receipts. Now that the fundraising has long been terminated and is in the process of closing, donors holding temporary receipts are urgently needed to exchange for official receipts, so that they can rely on these official receipts to exchange for national salvation public bonds from the National Salvation Public Bond Fundraising Association. The procedure for exchanging official receipts is entrusted to Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm to handle. All donors who have previously received receipts that only have the name and seal of the bank and newspaper but do not have the name and seal of this association are temporary receipts. It is hoped that they will exchange for official receipts from Xu Accounting Firm at 123 Edward Road, Shanghai, during normal office hours from now until the end of November this year. Failure to exchange after the deadline will not be allowed, and temporary receipts will not be allowed to exchange for national salvation public bonds. This is a special announcement for your attention."

### Social Affairs Bureau Promotes Factory Resumption

### The Tragic State of the Enemy Setting Fire to Burn Houses in Zhabei

Special Article

### From "Sad Literature" to Popular Education

— Chen Wangdao

The day before yesterday, I read an article written by Mr. Shen Qiyu in a certain newspaper entitled "On Sad Literature," which roughly stated: In this war of resistance, "there are countless sad events happening," which should be used to write "sad literature." "Literature that expresses this true emotion can only inspire people from sadness to anger to grandeur, and there is no other adverse effect." However, "falsely expressing emotions and forcibly writing positive works," "what is seen is mostly "how are 450 million people," and in the end, it is "final victory belongs to us," which is not necessarily "popular or produces good results." In the article, he cited a reader's letter as proof for the latter, and for the former, he seemed to use himself as proof, saying:

"I have recently often loved to shed tears, shed when I saw my air force bravely night raid, shed when I saw the heroic sacrifice of wounded soldiers and homeless refugees, and when my wife and children were scattered, naturally, I also shed. However, I have not been decadent or desperate because of these sorrows, but on the contrary, I have strengthened my heart because of this. If there is any opportunity, I will not hesitate to die on this path of saving the nation."

"Not hesitating to die" is "grandeur," and this kind of grandeur sadness does not seem to be included in the single word "sadness." In reality, there will be people who "collapse and despair from sadness," and there will also be people who "become angry and grand from sadness." The difference lies in whether the emotion of sadness is combined with a strong will. A sad emotion connected with a strong will will be an emotion that is both grand and sad, making people feel sad and painful, but also feeling a sublime and heroic emotion, which is the so-called tragic feeling. There are originally many literatures in our country that are good at expressing tragic emotions and describing tragic facts, and now is the period when this kind of literature is produced. Countless tragic facts are constantly appearing, and we will definitely have countless tragic literature constantly produced.

These days, tens of thousands of Shanghai citizens are enthusiastically praising and assisting the eight hundred soldiers who died defending Zhabei, which is only natural, because this is the most clearly seen and understood tragic fact among countless tragic facts, and it is a typical example of dying to resist the strong with the weak produced by a strong will.

Literature that expresses these kinds of large and small examples should not simply pile strong will on paper and erase the sad emotions completely. But our war of resistance this time needs strong will too much. We are all forced to train ourselves into people who do not laugh easily or cry easily, like people made of iron and bronze who are not easily shaken. This is easy for some people to do, but not easy for others, but we must also abide by the so-called "not arrogant in victory, not discouraged in defeat" call, and also use some kind of form to call on others. We do not have time to concretize, nor to emotionalize. This forms the so-called "set." The shortcoming of this "set" is not so much "falsely expressing emotions," it seems, as it is being one-sidedly fixed on concepts. However, no matter how you say it, I agree with Mr. Shen that we should "write a little more personally" in literature.

However, in the will to resist the war and in the understanding of resisting the war, we are exactly requesting a "set." We are exactly still worried that the "set" has not gone deep enough, not popularized enough. We are still needing to promote popular education, to develop popular recognition, and to harmonize the will of the masses. In this area, phrases expressing determination and resolve are not annoying to speak a hundred times, not annoying to shout a hundred times, and not annoying to sing a hundred times. The students in the school diagonally opposite have been singing "Arise, you who do not want to be slaves! Let us build our new Great Wall with our flesh and blood!" countless times tonight. Listening to the sound getting stronger and stronger, they will probably continue singing it countless times. They are using the method of singing hundreds of times to train themselves and experience the tragic emotion of our movement to resist the enemy and save the nation. Resisting the enemy and saving the nation is a matter of life and death for the Chinese nation in the near future, and it must be dealt with with a broad mind. We must make friends with the most reliable friendly countries abroad, and we cannot but arouse the people at home to participate in the resistance together. All those who make a contribution to this, no matter how little, can be considered strength. We hope that all parties will relax their prejudices on this major matter, and the same goes for literature. Literature that is one-sidedly fixed on concepts may be due to the fact that it is too eager to do its best in this popular education. Or it may be because life is too one-sided and we have not experienced various scenes of the war of resistance. If it is due to the latter, it can naturally change with the change of life. The progress of reportage literature since August 13 is a clear proof. If it is due to the former, then it seems better not to change the original intention.

### Enemy Forces Attempt Three-Pronged Crossing of Suzhou Creek, Encircled and Annihilated by Our Forces

Enemy Briefly Penetrates Toyota Mill but is Repelled; Our Defense Line Slightly Retreated East of Xiaonanxiang; Fierce Enemy Assault on Guangfu Town, Lao Lu Residence Lost and Regained

According to war reports received by this newspaper this afternoon, the main focus of the battles along the entire front remains on the central and right flank lines. On the right flank, starting yesterday morning and continuing until dawn today, the enemy launched continuous southward attacks within a 24-hour period along the Suzhou Creek from Fanhuang Iron Bridge westward to the northern bank of Shenji Bang (i.e., Yaojiadu). Our troops defended firmly on the southern bank, repelling numerous enemy attempts to cross the river. However, under the cover of heavy artillery and smoke screens, the enemy managed to force crossings at Beixin Jing and Zhoujia Bridge, though in small numbers. Last night, these enemy troops were encircled and annihilated by our forces, leaving no enemy presence on the southern bank. It is estimated that 50 to 60 rifles were seized at Beixin Jing and 20 to 30 at Zhoujia Bridge. Few survived, with most drowning in the river. This morning around 3 a.m., unwilling to accept complete failure at the aforementioned locations, the enemy dispatched approximately one company of infantry, attempting to cross the river stealthily near the Zhongshan Road Bridge. They were suppressed by our machine gun fire. However, a small detachment of approximately 20 enemy soldiers managed to reach positions near the Toyota Mill. They were then subjected to several attacks by our troops, and, lacking a firm foothold, they immediately collapsed and retreated. We seized over a dozen rifles. After dawn, the enemy resorted solely to artillery bombardment, which our troops met with calm resistance, holding firm. As of noon, both sides were engaged in a standoff across the river. On the central front, the enemy continues to pursue a central breakthrough strategy, aiming for Nanxiang. They have launched vigorous attacks along this line in recent days. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., the enemy again used over 30 tanks to cover their infantry, launching fierce attacks on Wangtang Bridge, Zhangxian Temple, Xiejia Zhai, and other locations. They were repelled multiple times by our forces, resulting in intense fighting and heavy enemy casualties. Later, enemy tanks broke through, forcing our troops to retreat and abandon those locations, holding firm along the Zhuyuan, Shiditang, Qiujia Zhai, Aibang Tou, and Sijia Bridge line. On the left flank, the enemy's objective appears to be focused on the Guangfu line. Yesterday afternoon at 4:40 p.m., a unit of the enemy's 2nd Division launched a fierce attack on Lao Lu Residence south of Guangfu. The village was temporarily lost but was retaken by our forces with a counterattack at 10 p.m., resulting in the deaths of many enemy soldiers. It is also learned that the enemy is currently attempting to use their main army to attack Nanxiang, while their naval infantry operates south of Suzhou Creek, and their aircraft bombard our positions and rear transportation hubs.

### Russian Representative Departs for Belgium to Attend Nine-Power Conference

Philippine Democratic System Protection Alliance Resolves to Condemn Japanese Aggression

[Moscow] After accepting the invitation from this country and agreeing to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Soviet government appointed Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Maxim Litvinov, Deputy Commissar Bodan Kin, and Minister to Belgium Rubin Ning as representatives. Litvinov and Bodan Kin (one person) departed for Brussels at 10 p.m. this evening. Belgian Minister to the Soviet Union Leidelier and several Soviet government officials saw them off at the station. According to Soviet political figures, the Soviet delegation has high hopes for the attitude of the United States at this conference and believes that the only way to stop Japan's aggression against China is to rely on the United States. This is because England is prepared to support any compromise that maintains its interests in China and does not intend to take any further action. In the United States, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have both given speeches condemning Japan's aggression and explaining that the United States cannot remain isolated in the long term. Soviet political figures expressed approval of this attitude and believe that although there are still many proponents of isolationism in American public opinion, they hope that Roosevelt and Hull can turn words into action. In addition, the Soviet delegation will support the principle that all peace-loving countries must form a united front to confront aggressor nations at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. However, it is not yet known whether the Soviet Union will put forward specific proposals on this matter. (Havas News Agency report on the 31st)

### Nanshi Calm Yesterday

Shops Open as Usual; Residents Relocating to Avoid Casualties

The enemy forces recently issued a threatening announcement stating that they would launch a large-scale bombing of Nanshi. A reporter visited Nanshi to investigate and found that the situation there was still very stable. Most of the shops on Zhaojia Road, Fangbang Road, Xiaodongmen, and other main streets were still open. Police and trained citizens were maintaining order as usual, with a calm and composed attitude. However, many residents were leaving to avoid unnecessary casualties. Therefore, at around 8 a.m. this morning, vehicles carrying belongings crowded the areas of Xiaoximen and Laobeimen. By 10 a.m., the traffic was even more congested, and traffic flow was almost cut off. Fortunately, the police were able to maintain order effectively.

Because no one was home in Nanshi at night, bandits were rampant, especially in the Guohuo Road area. Among the thefts were the motor of the Hongxing Silk Factory and the entire contents of a tobacco and paper store. Therefore, the police and self-defense corps believe that these bandits are operating in the Nanshanli area behind Guohuo Road. They are conducting investigations and cracking down on traitors. Rice prices in Nanshi have skyrocketed, and demand is exceeding supply. Therefore, it was difficult to buy five dou of rice this morning.

The French Concession Waterworks is located on the Bund outside Bansongyuan Road in Nanshi. Therefore, many French soldiers were dispatched by the French military authorities this morning to protect it closely. A French warship has been stationed outside the Qiuxin Factory for a long time. Therefore, there are no concerns about the water supply.

### Czech Minister Pays Courtesy Call on Mayor Yu

### Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Report

Shell Lands on Huizhong Hotel

On the morning of the 31st, an unexploded shell fell in a certain bathroom of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. The Fire Brigade dispatched personnel to remove the shell upon receiving the report. Shortly thereafter, the Fire Brigade dispatched an ambulance to transport a team of wounded Chinese soldiers retreating from Zhabei to various hospitals for treatment. Fire engines were dispatched several times. There were fires on Yangshupu Road, North Xizang Road, Guangdong Road, and Wuchang Road. A shell flew into a house at No. 442 Heder Road, but the damage was minor.

### Casual Comments

— Minister

Regarding the matter of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the London Times and the Observer have both offered commentaries. However, the views they put forth differ. The Times argues that peace in the Far East should be established first, and then peace in Europe. The Observer argues that peace in Europe cannot be contributed to unless the European countries make an effort to promote it. In other words, to establish peace in the Far East, peace in Europe must be established first. Both statements seem reasonable, but the first is more practical and appropriate. This is because peace in the Far East has already been shattered, while peace in Europe has not yet been shattered. It is like controlling water: if a dike breaks, it is best to quickly reinforce it, which will be more effective. If the flood spreads everywhere, it will be overwhelming. In fact, in the current situation, there is no distinction between first and last, or between East and West. The situation is such that pulling one hair can affect the entire body. But if this hair is not removed, the roots will grow deeper and the base will be more solid, and it will be impossible to remove this hair later.

### Enemy Warships Forcibly Occupy Hebao Bay in Guangdong to Build Airfield

Enemy Aircraft Carrier Moored in the Bay; But the Bay Has No Military Value

Guangzhou reports: Enemy warships sailing south are trying to obtain a base to open an airfield as a major base to harass our land, but have repeatedly failed. They are now using aircraft carriers to disrupt from the south, but fear our bombing retaliation, and keep changing mooring places, or simply have extreme panic because of supply difficulties. It is reported that the enemy once landed on various isolated islands overseas to choose a place to garrison, but because of the terrain of each island, it was difficult to land. Now the enemy troops have landed in Hebao Bay overseas between Taishan and Zhongshan counties, and are forcibly occupying it to build an airfield. This bay belongs to the seventh district of Zhongshan County, about ten miles long and five miles wide. The land in between is rocky and cannot be used for transportation. The water source is extremely lacking. It is usually only a place for our coastal fishermen to rest. The enemy troops were found to have landed on October 3, and simple wooden houses were built between them, rushing to build the airfield day and night, seemingly planning to occupy it for a long time. At present, there is an enemy aircraft carrier, three destroyers, and about 30 aircraft, half of which are seaplanes and half of which are heavy bombers. Those who have been harassing various parts of Guangdong Province in recent days have been flying out from there. However, in order to avoid being targeted, they take different routes for the raids. Usually five aircraft take the lead, with two aircraft on the side. A certain military expert said that the terrain of the bay is narrow and has no military value. As an airfield, it can only accommodate a dozen aircraft at most. At the same time, transport and supply will be difficult within a month. Even if the enemy obtains it, it cannot be used to park a large number of bombers. For the sake of self-defense, our province will impose severe punishment when the time comes.

### Six-An Cooperative Sells Enemy Goods

Enemy Goods Confiscated; Person in Charge Disciplined

Six-An Newsletter, Since the establishment of the Six-An County Anti-Enemy Support Association, the internal work has been quite tense. The association recently received a report that a treacherous merchant was selling a large number of enemy goods transported from Shanghai in Six-An. The association immediately ordered the investigation team to secretly investigate and discovered that the Gongying Bu in the Wanshou Temple District, three miles outside the west of the city, was selling a large number of enemy goods, including cloths labeled "Zhongxian Village," etc. The association sent Yunxiao Tuan, Xiangcha Tuan, and the Shangdian team to seal the seized enemy goods and report them to the higher authorities for strict handling in accordance with the law. The case has been pending for two months without a solution. Recently, Central Inspector Ma Yuanfang, Provincial Party Department Inspector Zhu Liyu, and Provincial Government Inspector Han Yisheng came to Six-An for inspection. The entire committee of the Six-An Anti-Enemy Support Association and the Zheng and Fu Zhuren of each group went to meet them and reported everything about the case in detail, requesting strict punishment in accordance with the law to warn others. At 4 pm on the 12th, the association held its seventh joint meeting. Ma, Zhu, and Han attended the meeting and unanimously agreed that it was unacceptable for merchants to sell enemy goods, let alone using public funds to sell enemy goods, which should be severely punished in accordance with the law to warn others. It was decided that: (1) the enemy goods would be confiscated, and non-enemy goods would be returned; (2) the person in charge would be reported to the provincial government and requested to be punished by the Civil Service Disciplinary Committee in accordance with the law. Thus, the incident of the Six-An Cooperative selling enemy goods, which had caused a sensation throughout Six-An City, finally reached a concrete solution.

### Hao Gengsheng Agrees to Unanimously Refuse to Participate in the Tokyo Olympics

The Dissolution of the Far Eastern Games Still Causes Pain; This Time, the Condemnation is a Righteous Duty

A Central News Agency report states that Hao Gengsheng, a sports supervisor from the Ministry of Education, previously represented China at various Far Eastern Games and Olympic Games, making significant contributions to the development of international sports in our country. Recently, Mr. Hao, in view of the sympathy of friendly nations towards our country's resistance against Japan, resolutely refused to participate in the 1940 Olympics held in Tokyo. He expressed his views on this matter and sent a letter to the Salvation Association of the sports community in this city, expressing his sincere support for condemning Japan's attempt to use international sports for its own purposes. The following is an excerpt from Mr. Hao's original letter to demonstrate his views (previous content omitted): He highly approves of initiating a nationwide appeal from the sports community to request all countries to unanimously refuse to participate in the World Games to be held in Japan in the 29th year of the Republic (1940). Recalling the Far Eastern Games held in the Philippines in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the Japanese representatives brazenly disregarded international regulations and unilaterally disrupted the organization of the games. At that time, Gengsheng attended the meeting and strongly condemned their actions. Although the final result was a glorious defeat, the development of sports in East Asia suffered a serious blow from then on. Thinking about it now, it still causes pain. This condemnation by us is a righteous duty. Gengsheng is not talented, but he is willing to follow the comrades in the national sports community and work together for the future of international sports, striving to leave a foundation for pure development (subsequent content omitted). (It is noted that the 10th Far Eastern Games were held in the Philippines in 1936. Before the start of the games, the Japanese representatives妄想inviting the puppet Manchukuo to participate, resulting in a murky atmosphere that was unbearable. Fortunately, the Philippines understood the bigger picture and was able to make the games happen. Unexpectedly, before the closing of the games, the Philippines disregarded public opinion and colluded with Japan to privately amend the charter, attempting to allow the puppet Manchukuo to participate in the next games. Fortunately, our delegation, Hao Gengsheng and Shen Siliang, reasoned with the Japanese representatives Abe and Soya, and the Philippine representative Vargas, but the other side eventually failed to achieve their goals due to being in the wrong, and the meeting was adjourned. Although our side was saddened by the dissolution of the games, the spirit of independence and self-respect was praised by the international community).

### Recent Japanese Industrial Circles

— Shi Ren

In the past month or two, Japan's industrial circles have been affected by the Sino-Japanese War. Except for military industries or industries indirectly related to military needs, which are showing active signs, other industries are generally sluggish. In particular, the textile industry, which is the foundation of Japan's nation-building, has suffered a great blow due to the war.

Looking at Japan's past trade statistics, the first half of the year is mostly an import surplus season, and the second half of the year is mostly an export surplus season. However, this year, February, July, and August have shown the opposite fact, that is, from the beginning of July to the middle of August, there was another import surplus of 136 million yuan. By the end of August, there was only an export surplus of 3 million yuan. As the "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun" said, the situation is not yet optimistic.

Balancing Japan's international balance of payments is one of the fundamental financial policies of the country. If this phenomenon continues unabated, it will inevitably shake the foundation of the country. Therefore, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Legislation Bureau saw this crisis and formulated the Trade Management Bill in late August, which is a completely wartime mandatory rule, consisting of eight articles.

(1) During incidents and wartime, the government, in order to ensure the operation of the national economy, can restrict or prohibit the export and import of certain goods when deemed necessary.

(2) During incidents and wartime, the government, in order to ensure the operation of the national economy, has the power to issue instructions regarding items that need to adjust supply and demand. A. The government has the power to restrict and limit products made from the raw materials of the aforementioned items. B. The government has the power to interfere with the allocation, transfer, use, and consumption of the said items.

(3) The government can request reports from or prohibit those who are related to the first restriction or prohibition or have been subject to the previous order.

(4) to (8) are penalty clauses.

From the above management bill, it can be seen that the Japanese government is making every effort to restrict the production and import of all non-essential goods and is focusing on the relief of import surpluses. However, in reality, its biggest goal is to promote military industries and suppress other industries. If we look at the raw material import restriction bill announced ten days ago, we can see its entirety. The bill consists of three articles, which are excerpted below:

(1) When restricting the raw materials for export industries such as cotton and wool, it must be in proportion to the export volume to prevent large-scale imports.

(2) After the raw materials are imported and become products, due to the soaring prices of these raw materials, the prices of these products are also soaring. Therefore, there is no profit to be made by exporting them to foreign countries for dumping, and they are instead sold domestically. All such behaviors should be prevented.

(3) Import raw materials from countries that practice exchange as much as possible, and restrict imports from other countries. This bill is almost exclusively designed to target the import of wool and cotton. Therefore, the import of wool and cotton will be greatly affected by this law. Japan's self-sufficiency rate for wool and cotton is only about 5%. Other countries rely on thrift. Once the import of raw materials is controlled, it should cause great panic. For example, the recent suspension of auctions at the Osaka Cotton Exchange is not without the influence of this bill. In fact, the most important thing is the struggle between the Textile Federation and the Department of Commerce and Industry, that is, in late August, the Textile Federation believed that the suspension of work due to the suspension of raw material imports and the influence of the Ministry of Finance's restriction on foreign exchange affected the purchase of goods, and requested ways to facilitate it, but the government believed that the amount of raw materials purchased this year was enough to manufacture until January of next spring, so it did not approve the request. Because of this war, general factories without cotton and wool stopped working, which not only created countless unemployed workers, but also shook the foundation of Japan's industry.

Similar to the situation in the textile industry, the electricity and steel industries have also been severely controlled, but because these two industries have a close relationship with military industries, they are not as painful as the textile industry. In terms of electricity, the possibility of realizing the recent national electricity policy has been seen. According to this movement, it was originally launched by the Hirota Cabinet, using Raimu's plan to nationalize the electrical business, but it was declared a failure due to the opposition of various companies and the collapse of the Hirota Cabinet. However, recently, under the influence of the domestic war, this movement has been promoted again, but the content has been slightly changed. It was proposed by the Political Economy Research Association and the Tokyo National Policy Research Association (the most powerful group in opposition, three members of the Konoe Cabinet and the secretary-general are members of this association), and it seems to have been approved by the Ministry of Communications. The plan consists of five articles, which are selectively translated below:

(1) Make the current electrical companies adapt to the national economic plan.

(2) Establish a special company to develop undeveloped electricity. Harmonize the advantages of capitalism with the requirements of the state's planned economy to become a new national enterprise model.

(3) The allocation of electricity and debt will be determined and promoted by the government from the government's perspective.

(4) Provide cheap electricity for special production projects in national policy.

(5) (Omitted)

This bill is of course beneficial and harmless to the government, but it is quite unfavorable to the established power companies, so it will be opposed by various power companies, which is expected. However, under the current circumstances, the power of the military government has dominated everything, and it is feared that the various companies will not be able to do anything.

As for steel, due to the expansion of military demand in various countries, there has been a steel famine, especially in Japan. Therefore, since this year, Japan's various difficulties and facilities caused by steel are too numerous to mention, such as changing import duty exemptions, mandatory surveys of steel companies, etc., all of which are noteworthy, especially the steel law published in early January is even more noteworthy. Due to space constraints, I will elaborate on it again when there is another opportunity.

Others, the most active industrial circles at present should be the emerging zaibatsu system. These industrial companies are all centered on military supplies and chemicals. For example, the Noguchi Enterprise Group, although it is based on the manufacture of light fertilizer industry, can become a major base for nitric acid explosion industry in wartime. The Mori Enterprise Group, although it is based on the manufacture of electrical machinery industry, but the aluminum it produces can be used as raw materials for airplanes and weapons. The Japan Soda Company, although it is based on the manufacture of soda, is a major base for the production of chlorine and other gases in wartime. Other companies, such as the Japan Industry Company, although it is not a directly military industrial company, it is actually a supply company for military industrial companies, so it has also had a noteworthy development under the influence of military demand. However, other companies, such as transportation companies and paper companies, have gradually shrunk due to requisition or restrictions. Therefore, in the current Japanese industrial circles, only military industrial companies stand in a dominant position, and other industrial companies have shown a decline. However, in reality, although military industries are active, their stocks are still plummeting along with other rayon, refined, and textile stocks, which is the most noteworthy fact. This matter has left the Japanese government at a loss. According to the "Tokyo Asahi" news on September 5, the Tokyo Stock Exchange is establishing a securities investment company to absorb a large amount of stock and raise its value. This kind of incomplete method cannot save the crisis at all. Therefore, it can be seen that Japan's general industry is already on the verge of crisis!

### The Responsibility of Youth

— Su

Everyone! You are all Chinese youth. Now that the country has reached a critical moment, you must be very enthusiastic, relying on the ability that youth should have, to fulfill the responsibilities that our youth should fulfill, in order to enhance the strength of resistance.

However, we must know that we do not necessarily have to go to the front line to kill the enemy to be considered resisting. We only need to take out our own strength. Simply put, those of us who have money should take out money to help the country, and those who have ability can contribute their ability to the country.

We must also know that our resistance is a long-term one, so our national salvation work is also continuous. Each of us should be responsible for training the people in our families and rushing to do some national salvation work. The elderly ladies can be asked to help make cotton vests for the soldiers at the front. The young people can participate in various national salvation organizations and serve in the rear. As for younger siblings, you can teach them three or four national salvation songs. Furthermore, the most important point is that we should analyze and explain the news of the war in the newspapers to the people in our families in great detail every day. These important and easy-to-do tasks need everyone to take responsibility for promoting them. I think everyone will not refuse, right?

### Jiangwan and Zhabei are Desolate

Enemy Troops Burn and Plunder, Leaving No Trace of Human Habitation

According to military sources, after our troops withdrew from the Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Dachang lines, all places were set on fire and plundered by the enemy troops. It was a desolate scene with hardly any intact land. Our country's residents had all evacuated in advance, so although the enemy troops occupied the above-mentioned places, they were actually in a desolate island with no trace of human habitation. Everywhere they looked was empty and silent like death. Even the enemy's Japanese spokesman even lied to foreign reporters, claiming that groups of Chinese residents had returned to their original places in Dachang, Zhabei, and other places, and were able to live and work in peace. This is completely a case of burying one's head in the sand and deceiving people. The reporters of various newspapers also sneered and rebuked his absurd words.

### Traitorous Merchants Still Continuously Import Enemy Goods

2.5 Million Yuan Reached in September; Seafood and Rayon Accounted for the Majority

The value of enemy goods imported in September, according to Jianghai Customs statistics, still reached more than 2.5 million yuan. However, it has greatly decreased compared to the same period last year. However, in this tense period of resisting the enemy, there are still traitorous merchants importing enemy goods, which is extremely crazy. According to reporter investigations, a part of it was imported after August 13, and most of it arrived before August 13, and those who went to customs to pay taxes and pick up goods in September were mostly seafood and rayon.

### Publishing World

The Great Era

Wang Xinming, Xu Xingchu, Fan Zhongyun, Chuan Donghua, Zhou Hanmei, etc., in order to adapt to the discussion and practical research of issues during the period of resistance, published a weekly magazine called The Great Era. The inaugural issue has been sent for typesetting and is scheduled to be published on November 3. The content of this issue focuses on the study of the Nine-Power Treaty. Those who gave talks included Yan Huiqing and Shi Fajii, etc. Yan was the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, and Shi was the chief representative of our country who signed the treaty, so their talks are especially noteworthy. The second issue will be a special issue on the 20th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The price of each issue is one cent. The address for correspondence is at the Times Building, No. 400, Fourth Road.

Zhongfeng Semimonthly

Front Line Semimonthly

The Shanghai Education Circle Wartime Service Corps previously published Front Line Daily to provide reading material for soldiers at the front. Due to transportation difficulties, it has been changed to a semimonthly, still adhering to the purpose of uniting to resist insults and promoting the national spirit. The inaugural issue was published yesterday and its content is very rich.
