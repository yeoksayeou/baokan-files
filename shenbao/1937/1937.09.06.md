### Enemy Reinforcements of Two Divisions Arrive in Shanghai, Our Morale is High, Preparing for a Major Battle

The Enemy Attempts to Sneak Attack Shizilin, Our Troops Will Inflict Painful Annihilation. Our Troops Have Recaptured the Shanghai Bus Station in Luodian. Enemy Planes Flew Over West Shanghai Yesterday, Bombing and Massacring Civilians.

The following is a summary of the battle situation up to 4:00 AM this morning: ① A large number of enemy reinforcements have arrived in Shanghai, stationed in Yangshupu, Zhanghuabang, Wusong, and other places. They will launch a major offensive within days. Our army is in high spirits, waiting in full battle array, and will resolutely deal them a heavy blow when the time comes. ② A portion of the enemy reinforcements, transported by enemy warships, are concentrated in the Shizilin area, appearing to be preparing for a large-scale sneak landing. We are fully prepared, and no one will be allowed to return alive if they come. ③ The remaining enemies in the Luodian area are still surrounded by our troops. Our army has now advanced to the Luodian Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus station, taking advantage of the victory to recover six villages northeast of Luodian. ④ In the Yangshupu-Jiangwan area, apart from intense artillery battles last night, there was no major contact between the two sides. Our front line remains unmoved. ⑤ In the Zhabei area, the enemy launched attacks on our positions with small units several times late at night. Small steel cannons and machine guns fired intensely for a while, but when our troops jumped out of the trenches to pursue them, they quickly retreated. The purpose was purely to harass and was irrelevant to the overall battle situation. Our army calmly swept and drove them away, and the enemy ultimately failed.

At 2:30 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River frequently fired intermittent bursts of artillery fire, bombarding our positions in Zhabei and Jiangwan. Interspersed with the artillery fire were machine gun bursts that came and went, seemingly probing our positions. Our army responded calmly, not thrown into disarray. By 3:00 AM this morning, the artillery fire gradually subsided, and the machine gun fire also ceased, but the enemy warships' searchlights continued to illuminate the sky, defending against an air force attack.

### Baoshan City Fell to the Enemy Yesterday

According to the Central News Agency, after the enemy troops landed in Wusong Town, they were pressured by our troops and pursued to the riverbank. Since the night of the 3rd, the enemy has repeatedly reinforced their forces, launching repeated offensives against us. The two sides advanced and retreated repeatedly, fighting fiercely. On the night of the 4th, a portion of the enemy troops landed from Paotaiwan and advanced rapidly towards Baoshan, launching an invasion. Our army bravely met the attack, fighting a bloody battle all night. The enemy army suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy again sent a large number of reinforcements, launching a full-scale attack. Our army resisted extremely fiercely, but suffered heavy casualties due to the intense bombing by enemy warships and aircraft. The remaining troops were forced to retreat into Baoshan City. The enemy then bombarded the city fiercely with heavy artillery and aircraft, and our army made heroic sacrifices. Residents also suffered greatly, and the city fell into the hands of the enemy. Currently, our line from Shizilin to Yuepu Town is still guarded by heavy troops, and the enemy's attempt to communicate with the remaining enemies in the Luodian area will definitely not succeed.

### A Large Enemy Reinforcement of Two Divisions Has Arrived in Shanghai

They Landed in Various Locations in Wusong Yesterday. The Number in the Yangshupu Area is Also Large.

Central News Agency: The enemy warships that arrived at the mouth of the Song River the day before yesterday totaled forty-nine, carrying two enemy divisions of newly arrived reinforcements and a large amount of military supplies and ammunition. A portion of these reinforcements and ammunition were transported into the Huangpu River the day before yesterday at midnight by five enemy transport ships, two merchant ships, and two destroyers. Three of the five transport ships docked at the Yangshupu Wharf, and two docked at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf. One of the two merchant ships docked at the Huangpu Wharf, and one docked at the Osaka Wharf. The two destroyers docked at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf. This batch of reinforcements and ammunition was quickly unloaded and disembarked at the above-mentioned wharves. A large number of enemy heavy weapons were also unloaded and brought ashore at the Yangshupu Wharf (near the Shanghai Electric Power Company).

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) After the enemy troops retreated in defeat, they appealed to Tokyo for reinforcements. The day before yesterday, a large number of enemy warships, totaling more than forty, consisting of a mix of merchant ships and transport ships, gathered outside the Wusongkou. It is estimated that a total of two divisions of reinforcements were transported. Most of the reinforcements landed in Wusong yesterday morning and are said to be issuing orders for a full-scale general attack on the entire front within days, attempting to break through the encirclement. Our army is waiting in full battle array, ready to give them a head-on blow when the time comes.

After the enemy reinforcement units of two divisions arrived at the mouth of the Song River, they heard that all lines on the shore had failed and were urgently awaiting rescue. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, a portion of the enemy troops, about two regiments in number, under the cover of heavy artillery, landed at the temporary wharf built by the enemy in Zhanghuabang. In the afternoon, they joined up with the remaining enemies in Wusong Town.

According to news from Westerners in the Hongkou District, the number of Japanese troops gathering in the Yangshupu area in the past two days has been extremely large. Reinforcements landing from the Dalian Steamship Company Wharf in Yangshupu surged like a tide. In addition to infantry, many tanks and heavy artillery pieces were unloaded, and a large number of aircraft were transported ashore for assembly. According to the observations of Westerners, the enemy in Yangshupu seems to be planning something, and it is feared that once the landed reinforcements have been completely deployed, the enemy in the Yangshupu area will launch a large-scale attack.

According to the "North China Daily News", the Japanese troops in the Huishan District of Hongkou have been very active for the past few days (the 4th), appearing to be preparing to take the offensive against the Chinese army's front line. In addition to mobilizing four squadrons of eighteen-pound heavy guns and a number of tanks, a very large number of infantrymen have entered the district. At the same time, a large number of military aircraft were transported to the shore at the Dalian Steamship Company Wharf in Yangshupu for use in combat in the Shanghai area. All the aircraft were wrapped in oilcloth, only revealing their tails, so it was impossible to know what type they were.

### Enemy Warship Movements Busy Yesterday

The movements of enemy warships sailing to Shanghai were busiest yesterday. For the three weeks since the enemy began the Shanghai offensive, although they repeatedly attempted to land at various ports in the Songjiang and along the coast, they have been met with fierce resistance from our troops and have ultimately failed. Therefore, in desperation, the enemy sailed in forty-nine transport ships the day before yesterday, fully loaded with enemy troops, hoping to reinforce the units in Shanghai that had been routed by our army. Yesterday was the day for deploying this batch of reinforcements, so there was a special reason why the enemy warships in the Huangpu River were so busy yesterday. It is estimated that since dawn yesterday morning, one enemy transport ship and one destroyer have sailed in, and one destroyer from the 21st Squadron has sailed out. Then, that destroyer sailed back in at 9:03 and sailed out again at 11:30. At 9:50, another enemy transport ship sailed in. At 11:00, one destroyer from the enemy's 23rd Squadron sailed in and sailed out again at 12:30 (at the same time, one destroyer from the 16th Squadron also sailed out). At 1:01, the enemy ship Tangyang Maru sailed in and sailed out at 4:25. At 2:30 and 3:30, the two enemy transport ships that had previously sailed in sailed out again in succession. At 4:00, one destroyer and one transport ship from the 21st Squadron sailed in. At 4:30 and 5:00, two destroyers and one gunboat from the 1st Squadron arrived. In total, enemy warships entered and exited more than twenty times yesterday, showing the extent of their busyness in deploying reinforcements and replenishing military supplies. The reporter went to the Bund at 5:00 PM yesterday to investigate and found that there were still twenty-one enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River. Their anchoring situation was as follows: one gunboat each at Floating Dock No. 35 and No. 23, one destroyer and gunboat each at Floating Dock No. 15, one destroyer at Floating Dock No. 14, one gunboat at Floating Dock No. 11, one destroyer each at Floating Dock No. 10 and No. 7, one Izumo ship at Floating Dock No. 2, three destroyers at the Mitsubishi Wharf (one each from the 23rd, 21st, and 16th Squadrons), two transport ships and two destroyers at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf, two destroyers from the 1st Squadron at the Nippon Yusen Wharf, one gunboat at the New Mitsui Wharf, and one merchant ship converted into a transport ship each at the Huangpu Wharf and the Osaka Wharf, for a total of twenty-one ships.

### Enemy Troops Plot to Sneak Attack Shizilin

Central News Agency: Since the enemy troops reinforced the Zhanghuabang and Wenzaobang lines and forcibly landed in Wusong, they have been aggressively advancing towards Shizilin, hoping to make contact with the enemy in the Luodian area. However, our forces in Shizilin are strong and have given the enemy a head-on blow, and the enemy's plan has not yet succeeded. Therefore, the enemy has changed its plan and is attempting to land by stealth in the Shizilin area. Since last Thursday, four enemy warships have repeatedly attacked, attempting to land, but have been repelled by our army with intense machine gun fire. It is now known that the enemy troops have seized many of our civilian ships and concentrated them on the Shizilin river surface yesterday, appearing to be preparing for a large-scale sneak landing. Our army is now on strict alert, preparing to inflict heavy damage on the enemy.

### We Recapture Luodian Bus Station

Central News Agency: After our army cut off the enemy's rear in the Xiaochuansha area and completed the encirclement of the enemy in the Luodian area, the most important development in the past twenty-four hours yesterday was that our army, after fierce fighting, recaptured the Luodian Long-Distance Bus Station. The reason was that our army approached the enemy under the cover of artillery fire the night before, engaging in close combat. In addition to attacking with hand grenades, our army relied solely on bayonets to engage in bloody hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, ultimately achieving a great victory. In this battle, our army not only advanced to the Luodian Long-Distance Bus Station but also took advantage of the victory to occupy a total of six villages northeast of Luodian. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and great losses.

Jiading Postal News: The enemy troops northwest of Luodian, after being defeated and routed by our army, have stubbornly resisted for many days, using the Green Leather Bridge northeast of Tangjia Lane as a base, arbitrarily burning, killing, and looting the villages three or four miles to the left and right of the Shanghai-Taicang Road. Seventy to eighty percent of the villages were burned. The enemy troops were shameless the day before yesterday, wearing clothes robbed from farmers and scattering themselves in the cotton fields west of Jie Jing. Our army fought bravely, and was later reinforced by our troops from Pujiaqiao, who drove the enemy back to their original front line. Recently, the front lines between the Puhuatang and Jie Jing rivers have been repeatedly fought over, with thousands of bodies lying on the ground and most of the civilian houses burned down. The area north of Huanggutang is relatively quiet.

### The Enemy Suffers Strange Losses in Liuhe and Yanglin

Taicang Correspondence: The day before yesterday (the 27th), at about 3:00 PM, at the Xintang Estuary outside the East Gate of Xijing in the Liuhekou area, enemy warships fired hundreds of heavy artillery shells, and enemy aircraft strafed with machine guns, covering the landing of more than 400 enemy troops in small steamships. Our side calmly did not retaliate, waiting for more than half of the enemy to land before flanking them from both sides and attacking fiercely with hand grenades and machine guns. In this battle, several enemy soldiers were captured alive, more than 160 were killed, and the rest were wounded and retreated. At 4:00 PM the next day, enemy warships attacked Yanglinkou with heavy artillery up to hundreds of shells, destroying many civilian houses nearby. Four giant shells fell near the Longwang Temple in Fuqiao Town, more than 20 miles from Yanglinkou. A local resident, Mr. Ge, weighed them with a scale weight, and they weighed 72 catties. At that time, three enemy aircraft dropped bombs, attempting to destroy our positions at that port, but none of them hit. Our side struck fiercely with anti-aircraft guns, damaging the enemy aircraft's wings by more than a foot, causing it to fall before escaping. In this battle, about 200 enemy soldiers landed, but they were completely annihilated by our side.

### The Enemy East of Shanghai University is Repelled

Central News Agency: In recent days, a large number of enemy reinforcements have been added in the Yangshupu area, attempting to break through along the Jungong Road and connect with the enemy in the Zhanghuabang area. However, our army has stationed heavy troops in that area, and the enemy's attempt has ultimately become a dream. Yesterday, there was another fierce battle between the enemy and us east of Shanghai University. Both sides fired intensely with machine guns, but the enemy was never able to approach our army's front line.

### Burning of Enemy Aircraft Confirmed as Shot Down

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) One enemy bomber, which dropped bombs in our rear area near Hengfeng Road, Gonghe Road, and Zhongshan Road in Zhabei at 12:15 PM the day before yesterday and crashed in a wilderness on Zhongshan Road, was confirmed yesterday morning by our military authorities. The enemy aircraft was indeed hit by the anti-aircraft machine guns of our [redacted] Division's air defense unit, and its oil tank was destroyed on the spot, causing it to crash and burn. Afterwards, the body of the aircraft was examined and found to have the words "Showa 10 Nagoya Made" and "No. 48" on it. Two symbols were also found on the remains of two pilots nearby, one named "Yamamoto Yu" and one named "Kaneko Teiichi." Moreover, yesterday's "North China Daily News" also stated that according to eyewitnesses at the scene, the enemy aircraft was indeed shot down by our air defense unit.

### Enemy Army's Atrocities Declared Overseas

The Publicity Committee of the Shanghai Bar Association has appointed a drafting committee to collect reports from various newspapers from the date of the outbreak of the Shanghai war to the present, detailing all the enemy army's atrocities in Shanghai, disregarding humanitarianism and using large numbers of bombers to bomb our innocent civilians. This information will be translated into various languages, printed into a booklet, and distributed overseas.

### Tongji University Refutes the Japanese Army

The Japanese army deliberately destroyed our country's cultural institutions and shelled Tongji University the other day. However, a Japanese spokesperson claimed to the outside world that it was because the school was garrisoned by troops. The school authorities issued a statement yesterday to refute this claim.

### Inhuman Acts: Enemy Planes Bomb Civilians

Zhoujia Bridge and Beixinjing Bombed, Approximately 300 Casualties. Refugees Waiting to Cross the River Suffer the Same Tragic Fate.

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) The Japanese aircraft's atrocities are continuing. After an enemy aircraft was shot down in Zhongshan Road by our defending troops the day before yesterday, the enemy aircraft were unwilling to accept defeat and sought revenge. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, the rumbling of bombing shook the entire city, and the quiet air of West Shanghai was shattered. Five squadrons of enemy aircraft, a total of fifteen, bombed the Beixinjing area west of Zhaofeng Park and north of Bailinan Road, causing casualties among innocent civilians. Zhoujia Bridge, Chenjiadu, and Beixinjing Town suffered the most. According to current statistics, there were approximately sixty to seventy deaths and more than three hundred injuries in the two places. This cruel act of bombing innocent civilians will be condemned by the world.

Zhoujia Bridge

A total of nine enemy aircraft appeared in the Zhoujia Bridge and Chenjiadu areas in two large squadrons, dropping more than ten bombs. More than twenty civilians were killed and more than one hundred injured. After rescue teams rushed to the scene, some of the injured were sent to Renji Hospital, and others were sent to the Red Cross Hospital. The factories damaged in the Zhoujia Bridge area included the Far East Wood Factory and the Shunchang Stone Powder Factory, among others. Other places are still under investigation. At the time of the bombing, the villagers fled in all directions, running towards the Zhaofeng Park area in the concession. Half an hour later, the enemy aircraft left, and then dropped bombs in other nearby villages and fields, circling around until noon.

Beixinjing

Our newspaper reporter drove to Beixinjing and Zhoujia Bridge at about 12:00 PM yesterday to inspect the situation, but when the car arrived at the western end of Bailinan Road, the police on duty there forcibly prevented them from advancing and pointed to the sky, saying that six enemy aircraft were still continuing to bomb various places in the original area, and even rescue workers from various charitable organizations could not go there to provide assistance. The reporter had no choice but to stop there temporarily, but saw a continuous stream of refugees fleeing, carrying corpses and the injured. The road was blocked, and the scene was heartbreaking and unbearable to witness. The reporter then met Mr. Lu, an official from the Pusshan Villa burial team, who said that after receiving reports of many deaths and injuries from enemy aircraft bombings in Zhoujia Bridge and Beixinjing, he immediately led his team to Zhoujia Bridge to provide assistance. When they arrived, they saw piles of dead and injured, the scene as tragic as at the South Station, and they were all poor refugees. Most of the deaths and injuries occurred in a disused lime kiln, because the victims saw a large squadron of enemy aircraft flying over and all rushed into the kiln in panic, causing the enemy aircraft to concentrate their targets on that area, bombing and strafing even more fiercely. The surrounding straw houses were all destroyed and fell into the river. At that time, our office collected about thirty corpses, not including the injured. Unexpectedly, when they went back for a second rescue, they could not go because six enemy aircraft were still continuing to bomb fiercely in the original area. As a result, the hundreds of deaths and injuries in Beixinjing could not be rescued. The enemy aircraft's inhumanity is unacceptable to the world.

Reporter's Inspection

The reporter went back to inspect at around 4:00 PM after finishing the evening edition of this newspaper, but saw only ruins and rubble everywhere. The entire bustling town had become a wasteland. The town is located south of the Suzhou River and west of Robeugen Road. The houses facing the road are still relatively intact, but the buildings on both sides of the western end of the main street have been destroyed and have become a pile of rubble. Rescue workers are collecting corpses. The most severely damaged place is a teahouse, followed by the vegetable market. There are also four other places with less damage. Fortunately, there are not many residents in the town, and since the start of the Shanghai war, less than a third of them have remained. After this disaster, there are almost no signs of life. The reporter passed a snack shop and saw the tables and chairs in disarray, with cups and plates in a mess. Only the stove was still hot, and the leftover food in the pot was still boiling, imagining the shopkeeper's panicked escape. At about 10:00, two enemy aircraft came to reconnoiter the area and dropped two bombs. Several bombs were also dropped on Chenjiadu, not far from the town. Nineteen refugees waiting for a boat at the dock were killed, and more than twenty were injured. Although there are no exact statistics on the number of deaths and injuries, it is estimated that it is over two hundred. Finally, when an enemy aircraft flew over the Zhongshan Railway Bridge, it dropped another bomb, which, because its target was inaccurate, destroyed the Moriryu Steel Skin Factory run by the Japanese, causing a fire that burned uncontrollably.

Eyewitness Account

According to an eyewitness from the bombed area of Zhoujia Bridge, when a large number of enemy aircraft flew to bomb, many refugees happened to be gathered in the Yejidun area of Beixinjing, waiting for boats to be sent away. In addition, vegetable vendors from the surrounding villages were gathering in that area to trade, causing the enemy aircraft to consider it the best target for slaughter. Immediately, huge bombs were dropped and machine guns rained down, causing the refugees and vegetable vendors to suffer the same tragic fate. Although it is impossible to statistically determine the exact number of deaths and injuries on the spot, the sight of the corpses lying everywhere at that time was at least over a hundred, not including the bodies crushed in the rubble. Finally, according to Pusshan Villa's news, only in Zhoujia Bridge, a total of more than seventy corpses were collected and buried in two separate trips. Other places are not included. Judging from this, the total number of deaths and injuries in various places is indeed several hundred.

### Japan Denies Receiving the Notes From Britain, America, and France After They Were Sent

The "North China Daily News" reported that the Consuls General of Britain, America, and France sent notes to the Chinese and Japanese authorities in Shanghai on Saturday, requesting that the Chinese troops in Pudong be withdrawn to a certain location east of Pudong Road and south of Zhangjiadu, and that the Chinese and Japanese warships in the Huangpu River be moved to a location below Fair Road and the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf. That night, reporters from news organizations inquired about this matter with the Japanese naval attaché and the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, but both denied having received the official documents.

The "Ta Kung Pao" reported that the military authorities of Britain, America, and France in Shanghai, citing the fierce artillery battles on the 3rd of this month between the Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River in front of the Japanese Consulate and our troops stationed in Pudong, and that stray bullets fell in the Public Concession and the French Concession, causing significant loss of life and property, sent notes to both China and Japan, requesting that the Japanese warships be moved to a location below the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf, and that our troops also be moved to a location east of Pudong Road. According to reporters from the "Ta Kung Pao," as of 6:00 PM yesterday, enemy gunboats and the Third Fleet flagship "Izumo" anchored in the river area in front of the Japanese Consulate had not moved, and a small Japanese gunboat had been added to the Mitsubishi Wharf.

### American Maritime Workers' Union and Peace Groups Demand Government Stop Japanese Aggression

Reiterating Various Principles of International Treaties, Advocating Economic Blockade Against Japan, and Aiding China's Post-War Reconstruction

[Washington] A U.S. government spokesperson announced today that, while various parties in the country have petitioned the government to take swift action on the Far East incident, the government's Far East policy is still based on lasting world peace. Speaking in a personal capacity, the spokesperson asked that the government not blindly follow the prestige of pacifism in the bomb craters, while proponents of pacifism hide in bomb shelters or lightly display their force. The State Department is currently seeking to adhere to treaties such as the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees China's sovereignty and territorial integrity (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th).

[Washington] Six American peace organizations today jointly requested that the United States take the lead in abandoning all extraterritorial rights in China and proposed a suggestion to protect China and promote peace in the Far East, including the following four points: ① Abandoning all demands that undermine China's sovereignty; ② Abandoning public concessions and extraterritorial rights; ③ Abolishing the American ban on Eastern immigration; ④ Finding ways to assist the Chinese government in economic construction during the war. At the same time, they also demanded that the United States implement neutrality laws (National Telegram, 4th).

[New York] The American Seafarers Union, the New York Seafarers Union, and the International Longshoremen's Association today all agreed that American workers should boycott the shipment of military supplies to Japan, and called Japan an aggressor nation that violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. The United States should intervene (National Telegram, 4th).

[New York] Regarding the war between China and Japan, after six American pacifist organizations and the American Veterans Association successively telegraphed President Roosevelt, requesting the immediate implementation of neutrality laws, the American League of Nations Association, the Church Peace Union, the World Alliance Association, and key figures supporting the League of Nations also sent letters to Secretary of State Reed, requesting the implementation of neutrality laws and criticizing the various clauses of the neutrality laws, stating that the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty must be reiterated by all signatory countries on this occasion. In addition, eight maritime workers unions have also submitted a petition to the Department of Commerce, advocating that the United States should cooperate with the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty to stop the Sino-Japanese war. One union also demanded that an economic blockade be imposed on Japan and that China be given full assistance (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency).

[Washington] Local Filipino-American business circles today deeply believe that the Sino-Japanese war will drastically increase the sales of American goods in the Philippines, because the retail industry in the Philippines is mostly controlled by overseas Chinese. Now that China and Japan are at war, they are competing to boycott Japanese goods, and they will inevitably purchase more American goods. Moreover, the Japanese side believes that if the war is prolonged, the United States may change its policy on the issue of Philippine independence in order to protect American economic interests (National Telegram, 4th).

### Konoe and Hirota's Speeches on China Policy

Seeking to Create Peace Through Aggression, and to Eliminate Our Will to Resist Japan

⊙Tokyo: Prime Minister Konoe delivered a speech at the House of Peers this morning, the main points of which are as follows: Japan's fundamental policy has always been to seek friendship with China and to have her abandon her anti-Japanese policy in order to fundamentally readjust the relationship between the two countries. This has not changed to this day. Unfortunately, China does not understand this true intention, leading to a rapid deterioration of the situation. Therefore, Japan believes that its previous passive and localized policies cannot resolve this situation, and has ultimately been forced to actively and comprehensively deliver a major blow to China. It is unprecedented in the East and West for a country to adopt the exclusion and humiliation of other countries as its national policy, and to use this as an educational policy to teach young children. If the Chinese government truly reflects on its actions, expresses its sincerity in future cooperation with Japan, makes efforts to promote Far Eastern culture, and establishes peace in East Asia, then Japan will not pursue the matter. The measures currently adopted by Japan are nothing more than to quickly inflict a thorough blow on the Chinese military and cause them to lose their will to fight. If China still does not reflect and stubbornly resists, then Japan will not hesitate to continue the battle. Foreign Minister Hirota, in his speech, after describing the course of Sino-Japanese relations, concluded that Japan is seeking the harmony and cooperation of Japan, China, and "Manchukuo" in order to build a stable foundation for East Asia. What Japan hopes for is to clarify North China and to ensure that China as a whole will not have to worry about such wars again. To readjust national relations and realize national goals, I sincerely hope that Chinese politicians will understand the overall situation in East Asia and reflect on their actions as soon as possible to adapt to Japan's ideals. Land Minister Sugiyama, after reporting on the war situation, said that even if China were to engage in a protracted war of resistance, Japan would thoroughly punish it. Before China diminishes its anti-Japanese consciousness and loses its will to fight, and before Japan's goals are achieved, it cannot cease military operations. Naval Minister Yonai's speech was roughly the same. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 5th)

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota met with foreign journalists this afternoon and issued a statement, the main points of which are as follows: The fundamental cause of the Sino-Japanese incident is that Chinese leaders used the cultivation of anti-Japanese sentiment as a tool to achieve their political goals, and used diplomatic incidents to enhance their prestige. As a result, they reached a compromise with the Communist Party and publicly engaged in active war preparations against Japan. The non-aggression treaty recently signed between China and the Soviet Union has special significance. Japan cannot remain indifferent in order to prevent the Communist Party from invading East Asia. However, if China expresses its sincerity and reconsiders and changes its attitude towards Japan, Japan will, as in the past, prepare to recall its expeditionary forces and join hands with China. However, the Japanese people cannot tolerate the recurrence of such tragic events, and the situation has reached an extremely serious level. We are determined to move forward with our established policy until a fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese incident can be achieved. In short, China and Japan are neighbors and have had friendly relations since ancient times. It is not difficult to realize the ideal of coexistence and co-prosperity. However, for the sake of peace in East Asia and the world, I cannot hide my enthusiasm. I hope that China will reconsider its policy towards Japan, and at the same time, in order to restore peace as soon as possible, I also invite other countries to cooperate with Japan and avoid taking any actions that would prolong the current hostile behavior. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)

### Japanese Consul in Qingdao Lowered Flag and Returned to Country

Mayor Shen Saw Him Off

[Qingdao] Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Japanese residents in Shandong Province, including Japanese women and children in Qingdao, have been successively evacuated. More than 5,000 of their able-bodied men also began to withdraw on August 28th. At the same time, the Japanese consulate requested the Chongqing government to protect the property of Japanese residents. After negotiations between the two parties, it was agreed that the Japanese side would seal up all factories, shops, institutions, and residences themselves, and we would only protect public order from the outside. We are not responsible for the safekeeping of the property inside. We are not responsible for any losses caused by natural disasters or incidents, or by military operations caused by Japanese military attacks on Qingdao and its vicinity. The Japanese consulate will also provide a list of the locations of factories, shops, and residences to the municipal government for future reference. At about 9:00 a.m. on the 4th, Japanese Consul Ohtaka gathered more than 100 Japanese residents in front of the consulate to perform a flag-lowering ceremony. At that time, many Japanese people present shed tears. After the ceremony, Ohtaka and others went to the municipal government to say goodbye, and then boarded the Haruna Maru. Mayor Shen also went to the dock to see them off. Staff members of the consulate, naval liaison officers, and employees of Sino-Japanese joint ventures all returned to their countries on the same ship. The last Japanese warship anchored here, the Kiso, also left the port. Currently, Japanese residents and Japanese warships have completely disappeared from Qingdao. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)

[Qingdao] The Japanese warships anchored in Qingdao have all left, and there is no trace of Japanese residents inside or outside the city. The tense atmosphere in the city has now turned to peace. The municipal government has also ordered the police bureau to strictly maintain local order. (Special dispatch from the 4th)

### Liu Ruming Sends Zhang Lisheng to Report on the Battle of Zhangjiakou

Reluctantly Withdrew on the 27th Night; Chahar Provincial Government Has Moved to Yuxian to Conduct Business

[Nanjing] Liu Ruming, Chairman of the Governments of Chahar Province, sent Zhang Lisheng, Director of Construction, to Nanjing on the 5th to report on the Battle of Zhangjiakou. According to him, the Chahar Provincial Government has moved to Yuxian to conduct business as usual. Liu's troops are currently stationed on the south bank of the Ze River to contain the enemy's advance. The Battle of Zhangjiakou began on the 15th of last month, when his troops joined forces with Fu Zuoyi to recover northern Chahar. Fu's troops recovered Huate, Shangdu, and other places with cavalry. Liu's troops launched an attack on Zhangbei. There were solid enemy fortifications in the area, so although they reached the city, they did not attack. On the 17th, an enemy division and a cavalry brigade arrived. Subsequently, 20,000 puppet troops arrived. Our troops retreated to Hou'erba on the 18th, and the enemy began a full-scale general attack. We defended step by step. There were fierce battles in Shenwutai and Hanleba. On the night of the 27th, the enemy copied to the outskirts of Zhangjiakou, and Sizishan was lost and regained several times.

### One Soldier of Our Army Who Defended Nankou Single-Handedly Repelled the Enemy

Transported Ammunition and Bombed Countless Enemy Soldiers to Death

⊙Guihua: According to people from the front, when our army was defending Nankou, a certain regiment was sacrificed on a certain mountain, leaving only one soldier. He still did not retreat. This soldier was very resourceful and saw that there were still many guns, ammunition, and grenades left, which would soon be seized by the enemy. Therefore, he used his own strength to transport them back and forth and piled them up at the enemy's invasion site, and connected the guns and bullets with a fuse. Soon, the enemy swarmed up the mountain, vying to seize the pile. This soldier ambushed in the trench, and when the enemy approached, he quickly lit the fuse. In an instant, the ammunition exploded, and countless enemies were killed and wounded and fled down the mountain, not daring to invade again. A certain army commander learned of this situation and greatly praised the soldier's resourcefulness. Because the regiment commander had been martyred, he treated the soldier with the salary of a regiment commander. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)

### Foreign Military Expert Describes Impressions of Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai

Believes That Japan's Use of Heavy Troops in Shanghai is a Mistake

[Nanjing] A foreign military expert recently came to Nanjing from Shanghai and shared his impressions of the Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai over the past two weeks with reporters at his hotel. He first stated that Japan's simultaneous use of heavy and精兵 in Shanghai while fiercely attacking North China was a mistake. His reason was that, historically speaking, Japan's armed aggression against China generally avoided full-scale war. For example, during the September 18th Incident, Japan concentrated its forces on Manchuria. During the January 28th Incident, it concentrated its forces on Shanghai, without involving other places. During the Great Wall Campaign the following year, it limited the scope of the attack to a corner of northern Hebei. This was all done by taking advantage of China's weakness and division at the time to carry out local military occupation. This type of offensive strategy can be said to be active and has achieved important victories. However, the current situation proves that Japan has had to reverse its past course and simultaneously launch military operations in North China and the coastal provinces. From this, it can be seen that Japan has at least two weaknesses: first, it was forced to abandon its original strategy and extend the front line beyond its intentions; second, it urgently requires a quick victory, which reflects its vulnerability to a protracted war. As for the actual strength of the Japanese army in Shanghai, according to the expert, it is not to be underestimated. At least 70,000 Japanese army personnel are currently there, including the most精悍 of the Kurume Division, which is the former Japanese teaching division. Most of the mechanized units in the current Japanese divisions originated from this division. In terms of the navy, no less than seventy large and small warships have been concentrated there, with a total of nearly seven hundred cannons on board. In addition, the air force has more than 200 new-style planes for bombing, reconnaissance, and combat. With such a large and精锐 armed force, the combined offensive of the army, navy, and air force is clearly aimed at landing on a large scale in a very short period of time, breaking through a point in China's defensive network, and implementing the so-called central breakthrough strategy. However, at the beginning of the Shanghai War, the Chinese army fiercely resisted from Zhabei and Hongkou, causing the Japanese army's long-prepared land battle positions in that direction to lose their effectiveness. Subsequently, it repeated the old trick of the January 28th Incident, attempting to land in Liuhang, but also failed. It then shifted its main force to the lower reaches of the Huangpu River, intending to open a bloody path in Wusong, Yunzaobang, and Zhanghuabang to allow a large number of army personnel to land, build positions, and deploy modern weapons such as tanks and armored vehicles. However, every time it reached a place, it was severely attacked by the Chinese army. Although a considerable number of troops were able to land in some locations under the cover of strong artillery fire, they ultimately failed to achieve their goal of deep penetration. On the contrary, the "landing surface" of the Japanese army has gradually expanded, such as Chuansha, Liulin, Yuepu, and Baoshan, serving as targets for our army to seize the opportunity to break through. Regardless of individual combat results, the fact that this "landing surface" has expanded proves the success of the Chinese army's resistance. At least until now, there is no doubt that the Japanese army's chance for a "central breakthrough" has not yet been obtained. The fierce counterattack by the Chinese army on the 2nd and 3rd of this month has further reduced the possibility of obtaining this opportunity. The expert concluded that the improvement of the Chinese army's strategy and tactics in recent years was indeed expected, but what it has shown this time is truly amazing. At the same time, without China's unity and overall progress in recent years, it would not have been possible to create today's great turning point. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 5th)

### Foreign Military Officer Talks About Exaggerated Japanese Propaganda After Passing Through Shanghai from Japan

Fabricating Victory News to Numb the People; Learned After Arriving in Shanghai That Our Army's Positions Had Not Moved

When the French mail ship Sphinx arrived in Shanghai from Kobe the day before yesterday, it carried a large number of Europeans and Americans who had departed from Japan and were returning to their countries. According to their statements to reporters when they passed through Shanghai, when they were in Japan, they were deceived by the Japanese news policy and thought that Shanghai had already been occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese people in their country used exaggerated news to publicize their victory in the war in China. But when the ship we were on sailed into the Wusongkou, we realized that what the Japanese propaganda was saying was the opposite of the truth. As a result of the heroic resistance of the Chinese garrison in the Wusongkou area, the huge number of Japanese army personnel were still floating on the sea, unable to land. The losses suffered by the Japanese side's property in the Yangshupu area due to the attacks by the Chinese army's artillery fire, as well as the seriousness of the threat to the Japanese army's defenses, are enough to show the embarrassment of Japan in this war. Currently, all of Japan's important standing armies have been sent to China to fight. Currently, all of the transportation tools in the country, such as railways and ships, have also been requisitioned for military use. In addition, the government has ordered all employees of various industrial and commercial enterprises related to the war and military supplies to extend their working hours in order to increase their aggressive power. On the contrary, it clearly reveals its dire situation. However, Japan has now fallen into the frenzy of war. Every day, we only see the departure of huge amounts of troops and the transportation of huge amounts of weapons of war. Japanese newspapers are engaging in various provocative propaganda from the side. They seem to unanimously believe that China will be defeated with one blow and that Japan will have an absolute chance of victory. In their newspapers, the daily headlines are either "Suzhou Has Fallen, Nanjing Is Under Threat" or "200 Chinese Military Aircraft Have Been Shot Down" or "The Entire ×× Division of the Chinese Army Has Been Annihilated," exaggerating the facts and distorting the truth. Under the propaganda of such exaggerated news, the large team of Japanese troops left their wives and children with tears and bitter smiles and slowly headed towards China. According to the passengers, after we left Japan, it was like walking out of a dim and confused atmosphere. When the ship we were on sailed into the Wusongkou and reached the Fushupu River, we realized that the Chinese army's positions in Beizhan were still standing, and the Chinese army's positions in Pudong were still using heavy artillery shells from time to time to attack the backs of the Japanese army, posing a major threat to them.

### Japanese Warlords Compete for Territory, Infighting Becomes More Intense

Reactionary Officers All Dismissed; Konoe Ridiculed by Elementary School Students

A Certain Faction of Military Personnel Revolts

Tokyo Secret News: The current Japanese warlords are just like the Chinese warlords in the 7th and 8th years of the Republic of China. Each takes getting territory as their expansionary mission. Considering Japan only has the superintendency of Korea, the directorship of Taiwan, the Kwantung Army of the Northeast, and the garrison army in North China, the territories are insufficient for their distribution. Thus, the Shanghai battle is clearly intended for the military factions to get more territory. There are many internal parties within the Japanese military, and the infighting between them is very intense. Since the May 15th and February 26th incidents, the violence of the military personnel has been gradually exposed and has become increasingly unscrupulous. Unexpectedly, only one week after the start of the battle in Shanghai, a certain faction of the Japanese military suddenly had a conspiracy to revolt. But the opportunity was not secret, and it was detected by the authorities, who arrested a group of people, and this major event was thus reduced to nothing. Currently, the Japanese government is absolutely secretive to the outside world, so there is no way to know the truth of this matter. There is one thing that can prove this fact from the side, that is, on August 14, the Minister of the Army suddenly dismissed the Superintendent of Military Education of the Army, the Commander of the Konoe Division, and other four important military officers, and appointed new people. But the whereabouts of these dismissed people are unknown. There seems to be a secret existence. From the clues, it is not difficult for us to explore a glimpse of this major event.

The People Bitterly Resent the Government

Tokyo News: Since the military department began its armed aggression in Lugou Bridge and Shanghai, panic has suddenly arisen in the market here. On the streets and alleys, only demobilized soldiers are seen flaunting their power. All kinds of careers have come to a standstill. Therefore, the people all resent the government. But under high pressure, they all dare to be angry but dare not speak out. If someone makes peaceful remarks or writes non-war texts, they will be arrested by the headquarters of the military police. In addition to the economic exploitation of the people by the government, their mental suffering is even more unbearable. The grievances that these people have no way to vent are all used in anonymous letters to scold the government. Therefore, important government officials receive a large number of anonymous letters every day, especially the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Army. The Japanese people all use postcards, so their content is easily leaked out in the post office. The text of most anonymous postcards is to accuse important people of warmongering, and they often move them to commit seppuku to apologize to the people. An elementary school student sent a postcard to Konoe. The content was extremely humorous, saying: "Fighting a bitter battle with China, there are only failures and no victories. I advise you to practice golf more instead of training. After you become proficient in golf, declare war on China again." Konoe is just a dandy who knows nothing but golf.

### Relief and Condolence News

The injured soldiers were deeply moved.

The Children's Propaganda Circle National Salvation Association, yesterday morning, sent representatives Chen Juanjuan, Chang Bijun, Yao Yuanyan, Shen Jun, Tang Genshi, and Li Wenkui, among others, carrying large quantities of towels to the Sino-German Hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers. The representatives shook hands and inquired about the details of the battles on the front lines for special reports in the "Chinese Children" semi-monthly publication. All members of the education class discussed the issue of unity and autonomy. Yesterday morning, all member representatives also went to Aurora University to comfort the wounded soldiers.

The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, at the request of the majority of its members, voluntarily donated one percent of their monthly salaries, remitted to the Military Affairs Commission for distribution to the frontline soldiers, to express their condolences.

### Brief Report on Sending Away Refugees

The Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee yesterday sent 5,400 refugees in three batches to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Jiaxing. The supply group provided food to the refugees today.

The Yunnan Students Association in Shanghai, recognizing the tense situation and to facilitate members' return to their hometowns, specifically withdrew a portion of its funds to provide travel expenses. Yesterday, an urgent notice was issued (details in this newspaper's advertisement). Any member wishing to return home should quickly register with Zhang Tingdong and Wang Gongtian at the temporary office in Guangxia Middle School on Moore Road. The number of people is limited to forty, based on the order of registration.

The Temporary Relief Association of Fellow Villagers from Haidao in Shanghai hired the Tianfu small steamer, along with five civilian boats, to transport over 380 fellow villagers in distress. They departed from Taiyou Litou on the morning of the 3rd and headed directly to Wan Shi. The association has now received a telegram from the Xiashi Chamber of Commerce stating that the fellow villagers returning home safely arrived in Xiashi at noon on the 4th.

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Jingjiang Sojourners Association in Shanghai immediately began registering fellow villagers who were refugees and sending them back home in batches. Up to the day before yesterday, approximately 2,000 refugees had been sent directly to their hometowns, and the journey was very safe. Because the previous registration period was rushed, there may still be omissions. Therefore, starting today, registration will continue. Any Jingjiang fellow villagers wishing to return home by boat can quickly register at No. 15 Ping'an Lane, Zhehua Road, inside the association.

The Cixi Sojourners Association in Shanghai has been transporting fellow villagers to Hangzhou for their return home for several days. The association received a telegram from Cixi yesterday stating that everyone had safely arrived home. The association yesterday morning opened a special train at 8:00 a.m., which arrived in Hangzhou at 3:30 p.m. yesterday afternoon. The association has notified registered impoverished fellow villagers to promptly provide guarantors so they can receive free train tickets and board the train according to their assigned numbers.

Due to the lack of small steamers sailing to Shanghai, the Shanghai-to-Suzhou passenger service on the inland river route was temporarily suspended yesterday. As for transporting refugees, there was one Xiangfu vessel towing barges along the river yesterday, and it is expected to depart this afternoon. These refugees, numbering over 300 men, women, and children, are being sent by the Municipal Relief Committee.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Establishing Inland National Defense Industries

— Chen

During this all-out war of resistance, there is a clear need for our country's industry to make overall plans and seek comprehensive promotion. The China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks recently established a joint office and set up joint lending committees in fifteen inland locations. On August 31, the Executive Yuan also passed standards for reviewing interest subsidies for special industries (i.e., industries related to military supplies). Although these measures cannot yet be called industrial mobilization for a wartime economy, they are sufficient to enhance the national defense significance of our country's industry. If they can be effectively implemented, not only will our long-term war effort be supported, but also a portion of the industry left standing after the artillery fire can become the foundation for future industrial reconstruction. If our country's industrialists can all engage in the development of national defense industries under this national policy, they can gradually create a wartime organization for industry. Now, let's provide a more concrete explanation of the interest subsidy regulations.

Article 3 of the regulations stipulates that the government should determine the interest subsidies for special industries based on actual needs. There are many industrial sectors related to military supplies. If the government subsidizes and provides interest subsidies to all of them, it will not only be unable to meet the urgency and quantity of military needs, but it will also be difficult to handle them all at once, and it is also unnecessary. Considering the circumstances and determining based on needs will effectively avoid unnecessary financial consumption during a war when government expenditures are heavy.

The regulations also stipulate that the location of any factory applying for interest subsidies or subsidies must first be reviewed and decided. This article is particularly important. Currently, many industries related to military affairs are located in coastal ports or areas without military defenses. Enemy planes can easily destroy them. In the future, these types of industries should be established according to government-designated locations, which will ensure safety. This will benefit both national defense and investment.

Article 6 of the regulations stipulates that the duration of interest subsidies for special industries should be determined based on the needs of each industry. This point further demonstrates the government's determination to support industry. It must be understood that military needs and related industries not only require large amounts of capital but also have slow capital turnover and cannot be profitable in the short term. If the government does not subsidize these industries or provide interest subsidies, private industrialists may be daunted. Now that the duration of interest subsidies has been extended, private capital will be happy to invest, even if profits are difficult to achieve in the short term.

Now that the government has precise plans for the construction of national defense industries, all industrialists with even a little patriotism should make good use of their funds to strive for the country's final victory. Establishing national defense industries inland can not only support the war of resistance but also lay the permanent foundation for our country's industry. Compared to hoarding wealth and relying on foreign forces, focusing solely on personal plans, the merit or fault of these actions towards the country is vastly different.

### Britain and France Agree to Convene Mediterranean Security Conference

Twelve Countries Invited to Participate, to be Held in Nyon, Switzerland

[Paris] Regarding the French government's proposal to hold a conference of Mediterranean coastal countries, Britain and France have recently reached complete agreement and will issue a statement to explain it later this month. Today, they will jointly invite Italy, Albania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey to send representatives to participate. The conference will be convened near Geneva during the League of Nations regular session (the Executive Yuan is scheduled to meet on the 10th of this month, and the General Assembly is scheduled to meet on the 13th). (Central News Agency, Havana, 5th)

[London] According to responsible sources, the Mediterranean conference will likely be held in Nyon, Switzerland, located on Lake Geneva, between Geneva and Lausanne. Participants will include Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Soviet Union, totaling twelve countries. Although the Soviet Union, Germany, and other Black Sea coastal countries are not Mediterranean coastal countries, they have also been invited to participate because these countries' relations are very important to Mediterranean shipping. Allowing them to participate in the conference is intended to mutually protect traveling ships and achieve practical results. Regarding this matter, after Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Delbos spoke by telephone, it is reported that Britain and France have reached an agreement and will issue a statement tonight to announce it. As for the agenda of the Mediterranean conference, political figures claim that it will not only include the issue of defending against submarine attacks but also the issue of airplane bombings. The British plan to restrict submarine navigation in the Mediterranean has been endorsed by the French government. Once the Mediterranean conference approves this plan, Britain and France will submit it to the Spanish Republican government and the Nationalist authorities. If both sides are unwilling to accept it voluntarily, they will be forced to accept it. Therefore, after the agreement is established by the countries attending the Mediterranean conference, any submarine found sailing outside the designated area will be sunk immediately.

### German Social Democratic Party to Hold Regular Congress

Hitler to Personally Receive Ambassadors, Review Party, Government, and Military Representatives in Batches

[Berlin] The National Socialist Party's annual congress is scheduled to be held next week, lasting eight days. Representatives from the national party, government, and military will be reviewed in batches by the leader, Hitler, as in previous years. However, the biggest event this year is the upcoming visit of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Germany. The true significance of this congress lies in this. It has been observed that the National Socialist Party has not achieved any significant achievements in diplomacy in the past year, which is the opposite of previous years. For example, regarding the Spanish Civil War, although Germany has established close ties with Spanish Fascism, the results have not been as quick as Germany had expected. On the contrary, the European situation has become increasingly dark. However, the anti-communist declaration made by Leader Hitler at the last National Socialist Party congress has been echoed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, who stated that Bolsheviks should be driven out of the Mediterranean. As for the matter of the Italian leader's visit to Germany, the National Socialist Party authorities can use this opportunity to divert the German people's various concerns about domestic affairs. Since the four-year economic plan was announced at last year's National Socialist Party congress, the authorities and the people have worked very hard, but as far as the current situation is concerned, even if there are some concrete achievements, they are not as obvious as the suffering caused by the people's frugality. Air Minister, namely the dictator of the Four-Year Plan, General Goering, recently gave a speech to the overseas Chinese representatives' congress, saying that if there is not enough food in the country, he will immediately implement a food rationing system based on population. In fact, this method has always been viewed with disdain by the general public, but General Goering mentioned it without hesitation, and its meaning is extremely worthy of pondering. According to the national grain harvest statistics, although the authorities have taken various regulatory measures, it is still not enough to supply the people's food needs. Meat is also in short supply. Economics Minister Dr. Schacht recently published an article in the Minben magazine, which also explained the bleak situation of the German economy in accordance with General Goering's speech, saying that we now have two tasks: one is to obtain food, and the other is to replenish military equipment. Anything else is secondary. Schacht explained the crisis of the inflation policy, saying that as of the end of July this year, the amount of paper money in circulation has reached 7,000,000,000 marks, which is the highest amount since Germany stopped its expansion policy after the Great War. Judging from the above-mentioned situations, it is to be expected that the German National Socialist Party authorities will take advantage of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's visit to Germany to promote to the domestic public opinion that the government has a great deal to accomplish in diplomacy, so as to conceal its internal difficulties.

[Berlin] An official communiqué was recently issued stating that when the National Socialist Party's annual congress opens in Nuremberg next week, envoys from various countries will be personally received by Leader Hitler. Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang, British Ambassador Henderson, French Ambassador Poncet, Italian Ambassador Attolico, as well as the ambassadors from Japan, Poland, Chile, Argentina, Turkey, and Brazil, and the ambassador sent by the Spanish Nationalist government, have all accepted the Leader's invitation. However, Soviet Ambassador Suritz and Vatican Ambassador Orsenigo have both declined. The United States will be represented by Chargé d'Affaires Gilbert. The German government has prepared two special trains, and the envoys from various countries will be housed and fed on the special trains. (Central News Agency, 4th) [Washington] U.S. Ambassador to Germany Dodd recently said that after returning home on leave, the embassy's Chargé d'Affaires, Lee Gilbert, accepted the invitation of German Leader Hitler and decided to go to Nuremberg to attend the German National Socialist Party's annual congress. Dodd was quite dissatisfied when he heard about this. (Central News Agency, 4th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull said today that the government is paying close attention to the peace agreement proposed by German Leader Hitler among the United States, Britain, and Germany. This proposal was seen in a letter from Hitler to Lord Rothermere, published by the London Daily Mail. Hull also said that the U.S. representative in Germany, Gilbert, has been ordered to attend the German National Socialist Party's congress, although there has been much criticism. Hull said that there is no discord in the diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany. Almost all other countries have accepted this invitation, so how can the United States be different? As for the rumors that German officials advocated that Germans living abroad should be allowed to participate in the activities of the National Socialist Party, Hull said that the State Department has not received this information, and he said that when foreigners become citizens, they have already sworn to uphold the U.S. political system, so there is no such worry.

### Mussolini's Visit to Germany Causes Various Speculations

Police from Both Countries Deployed for Protection, German and Italian Newspapers Have Different Views

[Berlin] The semi-official political and diplomatic news agency recently published an article on the upcoming visit of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stating, "The visit of the Italian Prime Minister has a significance far beyond a simple visit. However, other countries do not need to feel threatened and uneasy because of this. In the current dangerous period in European politics, the cooperation between Germany and Italy is an element of security and stability. The political axis formed by Germany and Italy does not intend to divide Europe, but only benefits true peace, and has no intention of seeking hegemony, but is realistic and recognizes the needs related to the survival of all nations." (Central News Agency, Havana, 4th)

[Rome] Regarding Prime Minister Mussolini's upcoming visit to German Leader Hitler, the Prime Minister's mouthpiece, the famous journalist Gayda, recently published an article in the Italian Daily commenting on this, stating that the Prime Minister's trip is by no means surprising. "If the new system promoted by Germany and Italy is attacked by any party, each country will defend it with all its strength, but there is no intention of isolating themselves. Germany and Italy do not reject international cooperation, and the only thing they reject and cooperate with is Bolshevism. In addition, there is one thing that must be explained immediately, that is, Italy does not have any pro-British or pro-German leanings, because Italy can establish an agreement with another country after establishing an agreement with one country." (Central News Agency, 4th)

[Rome] Italian Police Chief Bocchini recently went to Berlin to discuss security issues during the visit of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini with the German police authorities. Bocchini has recently returned home, but there is still no agreement on the procedures for receiving Mussolini. It is rumored that German Leader Hitler invited Mussolini to attend the National Socialist Party congress in Nuremberg, but it is heard that Mussolini, in view of the current tense relations between the Vatican and Germany, does not want to attend the National Socialist Party congress, lest he hurt the feelings of the Vatican, so he would rather go to Germany after the National Socialist Party congress is over. In addition, according to some Italian politicians, the procedures for the future talks between Mussolini and Hitler will depend on the situation of the League of Nations Council and General Assembly meetings. (Central News Agency, 4th)

### Foreigners Sympathize with Our Country

Letters of Encouragement to Soldiers and Generous Gifts of Comfort Items

Yesterday, Mr. Li, a member of the Wuxi Native Association's rescue team in Shanghai, was passing near the Jing'an Temple Road Yu Yuan Road post office when a Westerner, noticing Mr. Li's armband, entrusted him with a package. The cover was written in Western script, which the association translated as follows: "Two bedsheets, one lunchbox, and one water bottle are presented with utmost sincerity to the brave and respectable soldiers who are working hard on the front lines for the nation and giving voice to the 400 million Chinese people. We wish you an early trip to Tokyo to kill the Japanese, the evil warlords who are disturbing world peace. If convenient, please bring the head of a Japanese beast soldier to your friend—me—to play with. Long live the great Chinese nation! Long live world peace! Sincerely, Smith Olin."

Furthermore, Mr. Tan Fude (transliteration), an American resident in Shanghai, personally visited the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai on Yu Qiaqing Road yesterday and donated a box of soda crackers for the refugees in the association's shelter to alleviate their hunger. Mr. Liang Zhuoren, the supply officer of the association, expressed his gratitude for the enthusiasm of the foreign resident. It has been noted that the association has recently received several donations and words of comfort from foreigners, which is truly admirable.

### National Goods Factory Association Requests Issuance of Circulation Vouchers

For Domestic Circulation and Exchange of Goods, with a Provisional Issuance of 500 Million Yuan

The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Regarding the urgent need to address economic difficulties in this extraordinary time, we request that the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China be instructed to issue circulation vouchers to regulate wartime finance and maintain production resources. Since the outbreak of war in Shanghai, [...] for the purpose of rescuing production, maintaining workers' livelihoods, and focusing on wartime economic resources, the association convened a meeting. It was unanimously agreed that to regulate wartime finance, facilitate market circulation, and prevent a shortage of funds, the only option is to request the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to issue circulation vouchers in denominations of 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan, circulating throughout the country, only for the exchange of goods, not for the exchange of legal tender. Industrial and commercial operators should be allowed to use movable and immovable property as full collateral, and the mortgaged movable and immovable property will serve as reserves. Redemption should be allowed on a regular basis, and the interest rate should not exceed four percent. The price of all collateral should be publicly assessed by an evaluation committee. The total issuance of these circulation vouchers is provisionally set at 500 million yuan, to be concluded within one year after the end of the war. The issuance regulations should be stipulated by the Ministry of Finance and promulgated by order." The resolution to submit the petition has been recorded. It is appropriate to record the case and submit a written petition, hoping that Your Ministry will review and implement it, and we humbly await your instructions with utmost anticipation.

### A Nighttime Inspection of the Battlefield

— Geng Ya

(Special Report from Our Newspaper) The day before yesterday evening, this reporter made another trip to inspect the front lines in the Wusong area. At 4 PM, two cars departed from Shanghai. The first car was a Boy Scout rescue team with two "serving the country and not seeking fame" driver friends, Zhang Genbao and Zhu Quansheng. They were originally workers at the Hua Fu Hat Factory. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, they volunteered to go to the front lines to do transportation work for a certain unit. As the car passed a certain intersection in Nanshi, they bought a bag of steamed buns to eat, and Mr. Pan Yunde, who was in the same car with me, said: "They are also paying for themselves out of their own pockets!" In the second car, besides me and Mr. Pan, there was also Miss Ye Mingyan, a student from Zhijiang University, who was also indignant at the invasion by the brutal Japanese and wanted to go to the front lines to participate in the actual work of resistance.

We had just circled from South Shanghai to West Shanghai when we gradually heard the sound of machines, coming from far away. Mr. Zhang in the front car held up four fingers, and we immediately understood that four enemy planes were coming to "see us off." Seeing the situation, it was indeed unfavorable, so we quickly stopped the car in the depths of the green shade, got out of the car and dispersed, waiting in full array. But after their arrival, they did not drop any bombs. After a mutual understanding, we continued on our way.

The village houses and buildings seen along the road, although inevitably with broken beams and rafters and mottled scars, were mostly unchanged from the last few days. What is most heartbreaking is that the Zhenru International Radio Station was newly and severely damaged in several key areas. Looking at the towering water tower, it had suddenly collapsed to the ground, and the sound of dripping water could still be faintly heard. More than ten miles past Dachang, the more than two hundred dairy cows of a certain dairy farm that were killed by the bombing, piles of flesh and blood in the east and piles of bones in the west, were emitting all their stench in the remaining glow of the setting sun. The autumn cicadas on the branches were still humming intermittently, as if crying out their full of sorrow for them, and as if cursing the brutality of the Japanese army!

The magnificent and beautiful city center of the Municipal Government, in the eyes of the enemy planes, which were glaring like tigers, was undoubtedly the most desirable bombing target!

Going further southwest, Fudan University, the highest institution of higher learning in Jiangwan, was also bombed "beyond recognition" by the crazed and brutal enemy artillery fire. It is reported that the entire gymnasium was destroyed, the library's second floor was damaged, the roof of the fourth dormitory was completely bombed, and Zibin College, the first dormitory, and the women's dormitory were all partially damaged; the remaining offices were fortunately unharmed.

Night fell over the earth, and the sound of gunfire also temporarily subsided. But the enemy, having suffered defeats for several days, sent out planes early, sometimes releasing flares that could illuminate a radius of two thousand meters, the brightness of which was even brighter than the autumn moon, the purpose of which was only to scout our artillery positions and the night activities of our infantry. This bomb could light up continuously for four or five minutes. A certain adjutant advised us not to go any further, so we had to hide and change direction to visit General Zhong Song, the commander of a certain brigade, an anti-Japanese hero!

General Zhong looked to be no more than thirty-four or five years old, but his war reports of advancing without retreat for several days and nights in Hongkou, I am afraid that no one would not deeply pay their utmost respect after reading them! Indeed, in those days of bloody battle, our brave soldiers who killed the enemy were either charging forward on a path of blood, or lying in the battlefields where the mud and water reached their waists, risking a hundred deaths to resist the enemy's tanks and artillery. But we must know that without this spirit of hard struggle, we cannot build the foundation of today's overall advantage of the Songhu anti-Japanese war!

After General Zhong pointed to the military map on the wall and told us about the battle situation on each front that day, the reporter wanted to peek at the prospects of the war, so he asked him a question: what are the advantages and disadvantages of the enemy army? He said without hesitation: "Besides the fact that the enemy army has dozens more warships and a few more planes that are making trouble, the rest are their weaknesses." Then he said: "First, the operation in Songhu, is it full of positives or negatives? It is really inconvenient for the enemy's military weapons to operate; second, they have no base, and military supplies are not easy to replenish. For example, the enemy's army soldiers, coming from the three islands by wind and waves, are mostly dizzy. As soon as they enter Wusong, they hear the sound of killing, which will inevitably have a very positive impact on their fighting spirit; third, if they suffer a defeat after landing, they can only jump into the Huangpu River and the Yangtze River. Therefore, we not only have the advantage over the enemy in terms of people and two points, but also the superiority of time and place. We can also bring the enemy to death!" If we objectively reflect on it again, these words are not an exaggeration.

Before parting, he greatly praised Miss Ye Mingyan's ambition to participate in the front-line work and specially inscribed the four characters "Chinese Hero" and instructed her to organize a certain special task force and invite her to participate separately by letter. In addition, with equal opportunity, he also inscribed "Be loyal to the country and swear to defend the territory to the death," and gave it to Mr. Pan and the reporter, a spirit of public loyalty and patriotism, as if it could be seen in the lines of the characters.

When returning, because there was a curfew along the way and no lights were allowed to be turned on, it was quite inconvenient to grope on Zhengwan Road. Suddenly, enemy planes fired several flares in the distance, and the driver couldn't help but happily say: "These are not flares, but life-saving bombs!" So we arrived safely in Shanghai very smoothly.

### All Parties Enthusiastically Subscribe to National Salvation Bonds

The Total Amount Has Reached 60 Million Yuan, Hu Wenhu Alone Purchased 200,000

Hu Wenhu Purchases 200,000

Hu Wenhu, an overseas Chinese businessman in Singapore, has always been enthusiastic about the motherland. Since the full-scale war of resistance broke out, Mr. Hu telegraphed 30,000 yuan to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. When the central government issued national salvation bonds, it commissioned Mr. Hu as one of the fundraising committee members. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Hu immediately replied to the General Association, first subscribing for 200,000 yuan and vigorously soliciting subscriptions from overseas Chinese. There are many wealthy overseas Chinese like Mr. Hu, and there will be many who will follow suit and contribute generously in the future.

National Doctors Subscribe for 50,000 Yuan

The Shanghai National Doctors Association previously decided that the national medical community would subscribe for 50,000 yuan for national salvation bonds. It has now been handed over to the association and forwarded to the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee.

Fundraising by the Glass Industry

The Shanghai Glass Industry Association held an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday and decided to organize a national salvation bond solicitation team. It was decided that Mr. Wang Rongkun, the chairman of the association, would be the team leader. The provisional fundraising target is about 10,000 yuan. Once the target is reached, it will be handed over to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for collection and transfer.

### New Rice Continues to Arrive, Citizens Have Ample Food Supply

The Municipal Food Mobilization Committee is continuously purchasing hundreds of thousands of piculs of new rice from the interior. Recently, a shipment of Wuhu rice has arrived. Grain merchants in the interior are automatically transporting rice to Shanghai from the production areas in an endless stream. It is estimated that one million piculs of new rice will arrive this month. In addition, the population of Shanghai has decreased by one-tenth. The current population of the city, including Chinese and foreigners, is less than three million. The supply of rice is absolutely no problem. The food supply is abundant, and the price of rice is expected to be balanced at around ten yuan.

### Government Agencies Should Not Lay Off Employees in Extraordinary Times

To Avoid Increased Unemployment and Exploitation by the Enemy

Yu Chuanding, a member of the Shanghai Education Community National Salvation Association, and others, considering that the brutal Japanese are making all kinds of tricks, using unemployed people in our country to spy on military intelligence and disrupt the rear, resulting in a proliferation of traitors and hidden dangers, have suggested to various public organizations and petitioned the National Government to issue an order to all public and private institutions, groups, and industrial and commercial firms throughout the country to find ways to provide living expenses and maintain the original number of employees during this extraordinary period, and not to implement retrenchment as a way to practice thrift, so as not to be exploited by the enemy and harm society and the country.

### Relief Committee Agrees to Allocate 100,000 Yuan

To Relieve Refugees

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the United Relief Association of Charity Organizations in Shanghai has been incurring huge expenses since it began sheltering refugees. Although people from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated, it is still far from sufficient. The association telegraphed the Central Relief Committee to find a way to allocate funds to assist in continuing relief efforts. According to the association's message, the Relief Committee has telegraphed back yesterday, agreeing to find a way to allocate 100,000 yuan for relief, which should arrive in the shortest possible time.

### Solicitation

Housing, Nursing, Medicines, Clothing and Bedding, Funds, and Members

The entire staff of doctors and nurses at the Sino-Belgian Gu Ding Hospital and Sacred Heart Hospital, considering that there is a lack of well-organized wounded soldier hospitals at sea, have dedicated themselves to obtaining the latest and most complete medical equipment, including X-ray equipment, in order to avoid delays in treating difficult traumas and to preserve the strength of the resistance. In addition to bone surgery experts Huang Jian, Cai Hong, Cai Shoukang, Tang Shiheng, and other doctors, there are also foreign famous doctors such as X-ray expert Fa Si Adis who are willing to participate voluntarily. All doctors have separately raised large sums of money for medical supplies, which have been fully donated by a certain Westerner. This international wounded soldier hospital is generally fully prepared. The only difficulty is that there are still no suitable houses. If any patriotic people have houses in safe areas that can accommodate 300 beds and are willing to provide them for the wounded soldier hospital to borrow (if rent is required, it can also be arranged), please contact Dr. Huang Jian at 5th Floor, Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road, between 5 and 7 PM every day, telephone number 18379.

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the city has been shaken, and refugees from the war zone have fled. All wet nurses must feel that their milk supply is insufficient or even cut off due to the lack of food and clothing in this terrifying and abnormal situation. This matter is of great importance to the health of the future masters of the country, and it is especially serious for the future of the people and the nation. It has been learned that Dr. Luo Bu Sheng of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, the Chinese Medical Association, and the Health Department of the Public Works Department has immediately united to appeal to all sectors of society to generously donate large amounts of milk powder and fresh milk substitutes, or to fund the employment of wet nurses. It is hoped that enthusiastic women's organizations in Shanghai will take the opportunity to organize infant care and nursing classes and go to various shelters to diligently take on the responsibility of guiding and managing all milk bottles and nipple disinfection hygiene, etc., because most refugees lack common sense and rarely pay attention to the procedures before and after using milk powder and breastfeeding. Ladies should also take this opportunity to start a baby care movement. It has also been learned that a major milk company has agreed to hand over its daily surplus of fresh milk to the association for distribution to various shelters, so it is hoped that all sectors of society will respond to the news and generously donate milk powder or milk substitutes, cod liver oil, etc., to contribute to the cause. In addition, it is difficult for the association to investigate the skin creams that have occurred in various shelters, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will donate glutinous rice flour oil ointment and medicine water, medicines, and hand them over to the Shanghai International Relief Committee, address: Room 123, YMCA Building, Baxianqiao, or the Chinese Medical Association, at 41 Chihama Road, Dr. Luo Bu Sheng at the Health Department of the Public Works Department in Hankou Road.

The Relief of War Zone Refugees Committee of the Cilian Association has more than 30,000 to 40,000 refugees in its shelters, excluding those who are sent away from time to time. As autumn is approaching, the nights are getting cooler. The clothing and bedding collected by the association are far from sufficient. In order to protect the health of the refugees, it is planned to make 20,000 cotton vests and 10,000 cotton quilts, which requires urgent funds. Therefore, it is announced to all sectors of society to provide clothing and food, donate materials, and plan to draw craftsmen from the refugees to sew them.

The teachers and students of the Moore Hall Girls' School on Yu Qiaqing Road, in this time of serious national crisis, have established an extraordinary period service department in the student hall on the first floor. From September 6th, they gather every day from 1 to 5 PM to specialize in making clothes for wounded soldiers and sewing comfort bags, as well as various work to facilitate the refugees. However, there are few people and many things, and new and old classmates are still being sought to participate. The school will also officially start classes on September 20th. The Student Wartime Service Corps was launched by Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau since the outbreak of the Shanghai war and is actively proceeding. It has established branches in the war zone and non-war zone, with dozens of locations. In order to increase strength and expand the organization, a registration office has been established to seek the participation of students from various middle schools and universities in wartime service work. Those who have gone to register in recent days are quite enthusiastic. It has been learned that the registration date is limited to the 6th of this month.

The Shanghai Youth National Salvation Propaganda Corps, initiated by Zhu Feng, Liu Yuanzhao, and others, has been filed with the government authorities. Internal preparations have been completed, and it is planned to depart for the interior to start propaganda work in the near future. In order to concentrate strength and increase the effect of national salvation, it is specially expanding the recruitment of members. Anyone with pure thoughts, enthusiasm for national salvation, and a spirit of hard work is welcome to participate. Register at the corps at No. 167, Davenia Road, Da Tong Road intersection.

### Unified and Five Other Public Bonds Scheduled for Lottery Redemption

Held at the Bankers' Association on September 10th

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the prelude to the full-scale war of resistance has been unveiled.

Representatives from relevant agencies will be invited to supervise the site at that time to show solemnity.

It is reported that specific measures will be discussed at another meeting after the British Public Works Department replies to the letter. In addition, the rickshaw pullers' wartime service team established by the association will designate ×× locations for the vehicles serving the support association to concentrate and park, so that they can be called upon at any time.

### Niuzhuang Ship Stopped Going to Fujian Yesterday

Company Notified by British Consulate, Whether to Refund Tickets Is Still Under Consideration

The Taikoo Niuzhuang ship was originally scheduled to depart for Fujian at 12 noon yesterday to carry passengers and load cargo. Yesterday morning, according to reporters from the Datong News Agency, the company was suddenly notified by the British Consulate in Shanghai that the situation in Xiamen was tight and the Fujian Sea was already a dangerous area, so it ordered the ship to stop going to Fujian. It was found that this ship was the first ship to sail to Fujian since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, so it had sold a lot of passenger tickets in recent days. Therefore, whether to risk sailing to Fujian, the bureau is still considering. However, it was clear that it could not depart on time yesterday and must wait for the final decision of the bureau to determine whether to depart or refund tickets.

### The Water and Gas Company Will Continue to Release Gas Tomorrow

The Municipal Federation Advocates Temporary Suspension of Resumption of Business

The Municipal Water and Gas Company is scheduled to continue to open gas tomorrow, starting from the 6th. According to the company, since August 13, the company's concession area may have unexpected accidents, so it has suspended the supply of gas for ten days. Recently, the market has gradually recovered, so it has decided to release it tomorrow.

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the First Special Zone Citizens' Federation of this city sent a letter to the British-owned Water and Gas Company yesterday, stating: "In the case of the Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association, it was reported that the British-owned Water and Gas Company is preparing to resume business on Sunday and supply gas. The water and gas equipment completely contains toxic gas. The water and gas plant of the company is located near Xinlaji Bridge and close to the Chinese-controlled area. Now that stray bullets are flying, if there is an accident, the people of the city will be in great danger. Therefore, we are specially writing to your association to negotiate according to law and temporarily suspend the resumption of business in order to protect the people's lives. We deeply pray that you will consider the importance of the people's lives and temporarily suspend the resumption of business on this day when stray bullets are flying."

Our Troops Advanced Through Bloodshed, Enemy Casualties Were Everywhere, the Entire Line Advanced Two Kilometers and Is Engaged in Bloody Battles, the Enemy at Liuhe Launched a Fierce Attack on Us and Has Been Repulsed

Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, at 10 AM today, a confirmed report was received from the front lines, in the Baoshan area, our army retreated last night to preserve its strength and avoid its edge. All the troops were immediately mobilized and rushed up, arriving at the front lines before dawn this morning. After the preparations were completed, they joined the original garrison and launched a full-scale counterattack. With a command, all our loyal and brave soldiers advanced fiercely through bloodshed, one after another, with the sound of killing shaking the sky. Our artillery units also concentrated their firepower with heavy artillery and fiercely bombarded the enemy's positions. At the same time, our troops in the Yuepu and Shizilin areas also advanced towards the flanks of Baoshan. The enemy was caught off guard and retreated in confusion after an hour of fighting, with casualties everywhere. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and advance two kilometers along the entire line, and is now engaged in fierce fighting in a mixed battle zone about one kilometer around Baoshan. It is expected that Baoshan will be recovered by this evening at the latest.

Central News Agency, Baoshan City fell into enemy hands yesterday evening after a fierce battle. Our army defended the line from Yuepu to Shizilin to block the enemy's advance and prevent it from contacting the remnants of the enemy in the Luodian area. It also received reinforcements this morning and launched a fierce counterattack towards Baoshan, and is currently engaged in a bloody battle with the enemy in the Sanguantang area, about three miles away from Baoshan City.

### Our Reinforcements Arrive at Baoshan

A Unit of Our Army is Currently Defending Baoshan City to the Death, Reinforcements Have Arrived, Fierce Fighting Today

Baoshan County City, located on the riverside, is difficult to defend and was not originally a military stronghold. However, our garrison has built strong fortifications. Although the enemy has repeatedly reinforced and attacked, they have not succeeded. The day before yesterday (the 4th), enemy troops secretly crossed the river and landed from the Shayulongkou riverbank north of the city, totaling over 400 men. Using a three-dimensional assault with naval, land, and air forces, they fiercely attacked our positions. At the same time, the enemy from the Wusong Paotaiwan area also advanced from the side. Our garrison bravely resisted, unyielding. Both sides engaged in fierce artillery fire and hand-to-hand combat, with heavy casualties on both sides. Our army, facing enemies on three sides and in an isolated situation, had to retreat slightly. The highway between Baoshan and Yanghang was also cut off by the enemy. Yesterday (the 5th) afternoon, the enemy again sent a large number of reinforcements, launching an all-out attack on Baoshan County City. Our army defended tenaciously, putting up fierce resistance. However, the enemy used battleships and aircraft to bomb heavily, causing considerable casualties. As of this morning, a unit of our army is defending Baoshan City to the death, awaiting reinforcements. Since last night until this morning, a large number of our divisions have arrived and blocked the enemy on all sides. There will inevitably be fierce fighting today, and it will not be difficult to reverse the critical situation.

### Enemy in Eastern Shanghai Launches Fierce Attack This Morning

Enemy Planes and Ships Assist in the Battle, The Intensity of the Fighting is Unprecedented

Last night, enemy reinforcements of approximately 3,000 men, along with a artillery unit carrying many heavy cannons, landed and reinforced from eastern Shanghai on four transport ships. Starting at dawn this morning, the reinforced troops, in coordination with the marine corps stationed in the Yangshupu area, launched a fierce attack on our Jun Gong Road and Yinxiang Township area under the cover of heavy artillery fire. Multiple enemy aircraft also participated in the battle, continuously bombing our positions. At the same time, the enemy flagship Izumo, leading over twenty enemy warships, anchored in the river near the Qiujiang Wharf, using dense artillery fire to attempt to cover another unit of enemy troops landing at the Qiujiang Wharf, aiming to achieve a pincer attack with the enemy in the Yangshupu area. Judging from the enemy's objective, they attempted to advance from the Jun Gong Road and Yinxiang Township areas to connect with the enemy in the Zhanghuabang area. Our army fought bravely, not retreating even with artillery shells and bombs raining down. As soon as the enemy troops approached, they used machine guns to conduct dense sweeping fire. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented. After eight hours of bloody battle, there was no change in our army's line of defense. As of 1 PM, the fighting was still ongoing.

### Enemy in Liuhe Launches Fierce Attack

Enemy Planes Bomb Taicang and Jiading

The enemy in the Liuhe area, under the cover of intense artillery fire since last night, has again launched a fierce attack, attempting to restrain our forces so that the enemy surrounded by us in the Shengju area northeast of Luodian can break out. Our army responded calmly, and the enemy ultimately failed. This morning, multiple enemy aircraft bombed the Taicang and Jiading areas, destroying many civilian houses. Residents in the area are fleeing.

### Our Army Destroys Enemy Armored Ship with Artillery

Enemy Stealth Attack on Sitang Town Annihilated, Enemy Returns This Morning, We Remain Steadfast

Yesterday evening, the enemy troops in the Wenzaobang area, about four to five hundred men, used two armored ships, towing dozens of small civilian boats, advanced north along the Sitang River north of the Wenzaobang, using mortars and light machine guns to fiercely attack Sitang Town. The garrison of the town, our [missing text] unit, immediately met the attack head-on, fighting fiercely for several hours. Around 3 AM this morning, the enemy's armored ship, which was towing civilian boats, was destroyed by our army's artillery fire. All civilian boats were unable to retreat for a moment, and as a result, almost all of the enemy force was annihilated, with very few survivors. At dawn this morning, enemy warships used artillery fire to suppress our army's positions, attempting to cover the enemy troops in the Wenzaobang area as they returned. Our army remained steadfast, waiting in strict formation. However, as of 8 AM, the enemy troops in the area had not taken any aggressive actions.

### Intense Artillery Battles on the Eastern Front

Enemy in Yangshupu Intends to Connect Zhanghuabang Positions, Intense Artillery Fire, Fierce Battle, Enemy Unable to Hold, Collapses and Retreats

At 3:30 AM this morning, approximately seven to eight hundred enemy troops from the Yangshupu and Shanghai University areas launched a joint attack on our army's positions. Enemy warships in the Huangpu also frequently fired artillery to assist in the battle, attempting to seize the area and complete the north-south connection. However, our heavy troops were stationed there, and they were always on high alert. Therefore, our army immediately divided up and bravely engaged in battle, concentrating machine gun and grenade fire to sweep the area. Our [missing text] artillery team also returned fire fiercely with salvoes. After about two hours of intense fighting, the enemy was still unable to hold and collapsed and retreated to its original positions. Our army did not pursue them. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this battle, and our army also suffered considerable sacrifices.

### Remnants of the Enemy in Luodian are Isolated

Repeated Struggles Fail, Resulting in Collapse and Retreat, Our Military Strength is Strong, No Mistakes Will be Made

In the Luodian area, since our army bravely fought the enemy yesterday and occupied the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus station, the surrounded remnants of the enemy are still resisting stubbornly, but their situation is even more isolated. Also, the enemy northwest of Luodian has repeatedly advanced towards the Shenjiaqiao and Caowangmiao areas over the past two days, attempting to break through our Jiading defense line to relieve the siege of Luodian. However, after several attacks, they were met head-on by our army and collapsed and retreated. Although they are currently holding out and awaiting reinforcements, stubbornly resisting, we have divisions of soldiers or more in that area, vowing to never allow the enemy to cross the line.

### Enemy's Counterattack on Jiangwan Road Ends in a Miserable Defeat

One Armored Tank Captured by Us, As of This Morning, Both Sides Defend Their Original Positions

On Jiangwan Road, Baziqiao, Qingyunqiao, and the Hongkou area, since the enemy once launched an all-out stealth attack on Baziqiao, Qingyunqiao, and our army's defenses on the evening of the 3rd and the morning of the 4th, and was severely wounded and collapsed, the enemy in Yangshupu was again bombarded by our [missing text] artillery team at noon on the 4th. Therefore, in recent days, the enemy troops on the entire front line have been deeply worried that our army will take the opportunity to attack. At night, they often use a very small number of troops to launch stealth attacks and harass the front line. Our army, seeing through their plan, pretended not to notice, waiting for them to get close before launching a sudden and painful attack. Seeing that they had been defeated, the enemy became panicked and hurriedly used trench mortars, small steel cannons, and machine guns to indiscriminately fire wildly, in order to prevent our advance. However, our army remained calm and did not move, only giving them a major retaliation when the opportunity arose. Yesterday morning, the enemy troops again led infantry with three armored vehicles to attack our positions. They were met head-on by our army, using machine guns, direct-firing cannons, and trench mortars to bombard the enemy tanks. One of them was captured by us, and the other two were wounded and fled back. The entire enemy army also fled in disarray. As of this morning, both sides are still defending their original positions, facing off and holding each other in check.

### Pudong Defense Line is Solid, No Worries

Although the Enemy Attempts to Land Day and Night, They are All Repelled

The enemy's attempt to land in Pudong was indeed the result of extremely secret planning, so their attack was also all-out. After failing in the fierce artillery battle on the afternoon of the 4th, their ambitions have not diminished. Two or three small boats often appear on the surface of the Huangpu River, occasionally firing a few shots at the shore from a distance before quietly fleeing. At the same time, enemy warships and aircraft also frequently bombard the area, hoping to achieve a stealthy landing. However, our army's deployment is tight, not only does the enemy have no chance to take advantage of, but their entire army is wiped out and returns in disgrace. However, the enemy, seeing the failure of the battle in the Song district over the past three weeks and suffering heavy losses, and the later reinforcements being crammed onto warships without room to move, has never given up its attempts on Pudong, and there is an urgent need to plan. Therefore, enemy aircraft and warships have been constantly dispatched to bombard in recent days, but our army's positions are solid and the defense is tight, the enemy's attempt is just wishful thinking.

On the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese army sent troops to the Chunjiang Wharf, attempting to attack Pudong. After our army bravely engaged in close combat, the fierce fighting stopped at 7 PM that night. Their attempt to land ultimately failed. The enemy's ambition has been slightly reduced after this blow, so the situation in the past two days has turned calm. However, after 10 PM last night, several enemy warships anchored in Yangshupu again bombarded the area south of Yangjing in Pudong, without any target. Our army is aware of their strategy. This kind of bluffing is nothing more than wanting to prevent our Pudong army from taking action against the Japanese warships, so they use artillery fire as a demonstration. Therefore, our army also fired a few cannons in return, and sometimes ignored them. The enemy's artillery fire was intermittent, stopping only after dawn. Our side did not suffer any damage from the shells fired overnight. At about 7 AM in the morning, four enemy aircraft came to Pudong to circle and reconnoiter, and flew away half an hour later.

### Enemy Planes Bomb Refugees Again Today

From 7:30 to 8 AM, enemy aircraft bombed the city center again, dropping over forty bombs. Another fire broke out northwest of the Hongkou Fire Brigade, and the fire was quite intense. The large fire north of the Ward Road Prison had not been extinguished by 9 AM.

### Izumo Flagship Sails to Songkou

Opening Fire on Pudong and Yinxiang Port This Morning

The enemy flagship Izumo quietly sailed away from the No. 2 buoy opposite the Gonghexiang Wharf last night and anchored in Songkou to command the enemy warships in combat. (Another report) Between 10 and 11:30 PM last night, Japanese warships in the Huangpu River and our field artillery team at the [missing text] opened fire on each other. At about 5:15 AM this morning, a Japanese destroyer opened fire on our army in the Pudong area. The ship was anchored about half a mile from the Bund, and the artillery fire did not stop until 6:30 AM. The Izumo and at least seven other Japanese warships have left their anchorage yesterday and were heading downstream. From 8 to 9 AM this morning, Japanese warships opened fire from the Huangpu River, their targets unknown.

### Short Comments

— Liu

To save the country with five yuan seems a bit too easy. People are blaming their people for the added burden of 200 million yen, used to invade our territory and harm our compatriots. We are only raising 500 million yuan in national salvation bonds, only one-fourth of that. Compared to that, we seem a bit inadequate. But their bond raising is like draining the pond to catch the fish, while our bond raising is like taking something out of a pocket. How? It is what we call the “Five Yuan Save the Country Movement.”

The method is for various organizations, shops, factories, and neighborhood residents to contact each other, supervise and encourage each other, gathering their members, employees, and residents. Either each person or each household uses five yuan as a unit to purchase national salvation bonds. The amount depends on the strength of each person’s patriotism and the thickness of their financial resources, without any coercion. The recognized amount can be delivered directly to the bank by the subscriber, or they can elect representatives to take responsibility for collecting and submitting it. Or follow the Central Savings Society's collection method, submitting the list of amounts pledged to the collecting bank, and then the bank will send staff to collect the funds together. This is most suitable for neighborhood residents, and the bank will not refuse due to a shortage of manpower.

The world knows the severity of the national crisis. Who does not know the way to defeat the enemy? Military strength comes first, followed by financial resources. If we cannot contribute to the battlefield, then this small contribution, doing what is righteous and brave, should not lack its people. We will see the results later.

### Will the Second European War Break Out Soon? (Part 1)

— By Lieshan, Our European Correspondent

㊀ Is the Spanish Incident the Fuse?

Since the Spanish incident occurred last year, a war atmosphere has permeated Europe. When will the Second European War break out? This is almost a daily concern for the European people. The lines between the two sides in this incident are too clear. Germany and Italy are helping General Franco, while France and Russia are helping the "Popular Front" government. Conflicts over ideology (socialism vs. fascism), economic conflicts (Germany wants to gain the Spanish market), and military-geographical conflicts (Britain and Italy vying for dominance in the Mediterranean) have made the situation more serious and complex. If the Spanish incident were truly an internal Spanish matter, it would have been resolved long ago, with no reason for international disputes. However, the backstage bosses are giants on the international political stage. We cannot imagine Mussolini and Hitler allowing General Franco to fail. Similarly, we cannot believe that France, Russia, and even Britain would not use their power to maintain the existence of the "Popular Front" government. A fascist Spain made in Italy would change the current situation in Europe. Conversely, a socialist Spain would indirectly frustrate the momentum of Mussolini and Hitler. Spain, while not the final battleground for both sides, is a prelude to their final battle. Who is willing to give way? Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Léon Blum, or even Chamberlain?

Pessimistic? Naturally, in this situation, who can be optimistic! Recently, the only politician who has advised the people to be at ease is South African Prime Minister Hertzog. However, according to his explanation, the reason why war is not likely to break out in Europe at present is not because the countries are particularly friendly, but because everyone is excessively afraid of each other, resulting in no one daring to make the first move. British Foreign Secretary Eden is even less optimistic. He once told a foreign minister in private that "over the years, he has become an easy person to satisfy." He said: "The current situation may not have any hope of improving, but it has not deteriorated further. He feels that this alone is a reason to be satisfied."

▲ Is Mussolini Crazy? The person that most Europeans are most terrified of at present is naturally Mussolini. Two years ago, when everyone was cursing Hitler, many praised him as a pragmatic statesman. His tough and firm attitude towards the Austrian issue had gained material sympathy from Britain and France. At that time, the French government sent him an African colony as a New Year's gift. However, during the invasion of Abyssinia, Mussolini had already revealed his fierce nature, a fierce nature that, at least in the eyes of the British, could not be tolerated. When the Spanish incident broke out, he and Hitler were both the masterminds behind General Franco? Italian planes, artillery, tanks, and even Italian troops are playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War. Initially, Mussolini said that all this news was fabricated by foreign newspapers. Later, however, the official Italian newspapers formally published a list of Italian soldiers who died in the Spanish Civil War, considering these people to be heroes who sacrificed for their cause. Since Mussolini's attitude became public, everyone has wanted to know to what extent Mussolini intends to go. Mussolini once answered in an article: "To solve the Spanish problem, Franco must achieve the final victory!" Judging from past experience, he is not a person who easily yields. Italy is under his sole rule, and he is a "man of his word." Since Italy is willing to use force to back General Franco, the possibility of a second European war breaking out is naturally greater. We only need to see the recent withdrawal of the German and Italian fleets from naval patrols off the coast of Spain, and at the same time, they proposed the following in the London "Non-Intervention Committee": First, all countries recognize Franco as a belligerent entity; Second, abolish the naval patrols by all countries' fleets; Third, maintain the status quo of land surveillance. To put it bluntly, these proposals by Germany and Italy mean that German and Italian arms can still be freely supplied to General Franco by sea, while cutting off the land route for France to supply arms to the "Popular Front" government. Britain and France have expressed that they absolutely cannot accept this proposal. Mussolini's methods are becoming increasingly fierce. People can't help but ask, is he really crazy? It is said that he is not only unwilling to withdraw the 80,000 Italian volunteer soldiers fighting in Spain, but even has preparations to continuously send more troops.

▲ France Can No Longer Give Way? In the Spanish incident, the person with the most tolerance is probably Léon Blum. As a "Popular Front" government, how can France sit idly by and watch General Franco win step by step! But on the other hand, France's policy towards Spain cannot be independent of Britain. As a result, it can only take both sides into account, that is, non-intervention policy to a half, while supplying the "Popular Front" government with armaments also only to a half. However, this attitude of France did not gain the sympathy of all parties. In the eyes of Germany and Italy, France is always as "shameless" as Soviet Russia, helping the Spanish "Red Committee" or "Red Spain" (the name given by Germans and Italians to the "Popular Front" government). International leftists also feel that France is too weak and incompetent, almost indirectly becoming an accomplice to Franco's massacre of the Spanish people. In fact, the predicament of the French is not easily understood by ordinary outsiders.

However, the concessions of the French are limited. Although Léon Blum does not have the arrogant aura of Mussolini, he will never watch the collapse of the Spanish "Popular Front" government. The recent reply from the French diplomatic authorities to Germany and Italy is very clear. That is, once the non-intervention policy fails, France will open its border and allow arms to freely enter Spain. According to several British newspapers, France has deployed a large number of aircraft, tanks, artillery, etc. on the Spanish border. As long as the London "Non-Intervention Committee" collapses, these armaments can be transported into Spanish territory in a few hours. At this moment, the French seem to have expressed their determination. The people who need to consider carefully now seem to be Mussolini and Hitler. That is to say, after the Second European War breaks out, do they have absolute certainty of victory? If they must take the risk.

▲ The British Countermeasures British Prime Minister Chamberlain advises the British people to maintain a calm mind in the current serious situation. Liberal Party statesman Lloyd George said that this is not difficult, every fish has its calm "static" mind. He criticized Britain's neutral policy as indirectly helping General Franco. Foreign Secretary Eden said that Britain's only hope is to localize the Spanish problem, so as not to cause international disputes. Conservative Party statesman Churchill said that the British, like the Spanish, value the integrity of Spanish territory. Regardless of which side wins, if another country wants to create a military base in Spain, Britain cannot sit idly by. In short, according to the general opinion of British politicians at present, Franco seems to be secondary, the main target is how to deal with his backstage boss - Mussolini.

Chamberlain's so-called calm mind is naturally "adjusting to the wind." Originally, Britain's foreign policy has always been "flexible." Franco has now occupied one-third of Spain. If he really becomes the dictator of Spain, standing shoulder to shoulder with Mussolini and Hitler, wouldn't Britain's position in the Mediterranean be in danger? Britain's current countermeasure is to try to break up the alliance of these three dictators.

Britain's first move is to sever the relationship between Portugal, which has always been under British protection, and Italy, and then let Portugal directly influence Franco, indirectly consolidating Britain's power in Spain (that is, in case Franco wins the final victory). Portugal has always been a small country under the British sphere of influence. This time, due to geographical and ideological reasons, it has helped General Franco, which is why it has a relationship with Italy. Britain is an old master, so this policy immediately had a considerable effect. Recently, Portugal's pro-British tone and General Franco have also expressed their willingness to withdraw all countries' volunteer soldiers in Spain (this is Britain's proposition). Although this "undermining" method is more difficult to realize, it is enough to give Mussolini a big blow.

The second move is to try to break up the marriage between Mussolini and Hitler. According to a British newspaper, Britain has proposed the following exchange conditions to Germany, if Germany is willing to change its attitude towards the Spanish event and not cooperate with Italy:

1. Supply Germany with industrial raw materials.

2. Try to increase Germany's export trade.

3. Britain is willing to grant Germany a large loan.

Germany's economy is currently in a very difficult period, so this proposal is naturally a great temptation. In addition, the results of the test in the Spanish Civil War show that, except for anti-aircraft guns, other German-made weapons are not as sophisticated as those produced by French and Russian arsenals, so Hitler is also at a crossroads. It is said that these two dictators, Germany and Italy, may soon separate. Recently, the slogan of people in the British financial community is: Germany gives the world (Britain) peace, Britain gives loans!

### Enemy Planes Raid Nanchang Situation

Our Air Force Responds and Shoots Down Two Enemy Planes, Traitors Sending Signals Arrested, More Than Sixty People

The enemy planes flew from Taiwan, a total of seven heavy bombers, first two planes, followed by five planes, our air force immediately rose up to fight back, and a certain gentleman who first flew to fight, with one person and one plane, fought with one of the enemy planes, and won a complete victory by shooting down two enemy planes, one fell to the ground and was immediately burned, one fell in a nearby village, the enemy personnel, one died and one was injured, the injured tried to escape and were captured by nearby farmers, the villagers hated them, and stabbed them in the leg three times with a knife, and then sent them to the provincial government for disposal. According to the prisoners, the enemy initially planned to use 80 of the latest heavy bombers to solve our national air force bases within a week. Such a arrogant attitude can be seen here. Asking them whether they wanted to come to China, they said that it was all the order of the officers, and they themselves were absolutely unwilling. Since then, the enemy planes have repeatedly tried to attack at night, but all failed due to the tight air defense. Only on the afternoon of the 25th, at about 12 o'clock, the alarm suddenly sounded, and the authorities immediately implemented lighting control, and the air force was also immediately prepared to dispatch. As the enemy planes flew over Nanchang, suddenly dark clouds rose and covered the clear moonlight, followed by a sudden gust of wind, making it difficult for the enemy planes to control, and the anti-aircraft guns were arranged around, waiting for the opportunity to fire, to help our air force in battle, the environment was dangerous, and they were about to flap their wings and return, but the local traitors were so insane that they fired signal flares to show the target of the bombers, and used flashlights to shine in the air to send messages, and released firecrackers specially made of sulfur and rosin. At that time, the enemy saw that there were traitors on the ground leading the way, and took the risk to turn back and throw bombs. Also, in the nearby Liantang Township area, the villagers happened to be performing a play to celebrate the gods, and the villagers did not know the enemy planes were fierce, and were beating drums to the sky and the lights were bright, and the enemy planes used it as a bombing target, and suddenly threw bombs, and the villagers fled in all directions, and four or five people were injured. Later, our air force chased after them, and the enemy planes fled. When the traitors responded to the enemy planes, the authorities secretly found out the place where the signals were sent, and arrested them according to the place after the event, and captured more than 60 traitors, including the leader Liu, a military officer of the Agricultural College, who graduated from Japan, and was very knowledgeable, but willingly became an accomplice, and found Japanese letters and code evidence on his body, but his confession was cunning, and he is still under strict interrogation. In addition, the evidence such as sulfur bombs and flags was found on all the captured people. On the evening of the 26th, at 7 o'clock, four people were beheaded in the Nanchang Stadium and their heads were hung in four places to warn the rest, and nine people were shot the next day. According to the traitors, several people were used by the enemy from August 14th, and were given a salary of 3.9 cents a day, and were arrested on the 25th, and received four yuan and several cents of enemy money, willing to exchange the title of traitor from the enemy and lost their lives, which is hateful and pitiful. Since the Shanghai war, Nanchang must get an air raid alarm once or twice a day. Since this large-scale arrest of traitors, the alarm has not happened again, so it can be seen that the traitors are raging. Also, a gentleman heard many people say that the enemy uses traitors in a certain place in Poyang Lake to set up an aircraft refueling station, please pay close attention to it.

### Beixinjing Vegetable Farmers Request Protection for Transporting Vegetables to Shanghai

Residents in the Beixinjing area of this city usually make a living by growing vegetables and melons and fruits. Since the Japanese bandits invaded Shanghai, the area has been close to the war zone, and enemy planes have bombed the area for days. Even the remote rural areas have suffered, resulting in traffic jams. The residents in the area cannot transport vegetables to Shanghai, and their livelihoods are in a desperate situation. Therefore, the local vegetable farmers Wang Ashun, Hou Youbao, etc. jointly appealed to all sectors, requesting to restore traffic as soon as possible, and asking the military police along the way to protect them, so that they can continue to transport vegetables to Shanghai to meet the needs of the market, and at the same time conveniently transport urine and feces back to fertilize the fields.

### A Barber Swallowed Opium and Died

Su Shengzhao, a Yangzhou native who lived in No. 1, Lane 1369, Lafayette Road, French Concession, and worked as a barber, died. Nineteen years old. Because all the people in his family were killed by bombs in front of the Great World, and he himself was seriously ill with lung disease, and there was no one to rely on, he suddenly had a short-sighted idea and committed suicide by swallowing raw opium at 11 pm on the 4th. When he was found by his roommate, he was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital. Because he was deeply poisoned, the rescue was ineffective, and he died at 7:30 am yesterday.

### French Concession Taxpayers' Association Requests Not to Refuse Checks

Letter to the French Municipal Council

Du Yuesheng, chairman of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, recently received requests from taxpayers, saying that since banks cannot withdraw cash as much as possible, and the water and electricity company refuses to accept checks with credit, it will inevitably affect public security. Du believes that it is indeed related to the livelihood of the concession, and specially sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, sincerely stating his words, and asking it to immediately notify the French water and electricity company to use checks commonly used by national tax collection agencies to maintain the market. The original text is recorded as follows: "Dear Sir, We have received a letter from the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association, stating that since the outbreak of the war of resistance, in order to stabilize the financial situation, the government has formulated seven measures for banks and money shops to restrict cash withdrawals, and various taxes can be paid by check. However, recently, the water and electricity company in the concession has ignored the overall situation and requires all water and electricity fees to be paid in cash. If they do not comply, they will threaten to cut off the water and electricity. If they do not accommodate, it will affect the market and indirectly affect public security. Therefore, we ask your association to transfer the matter to the municipal government and the concession authorities for immediate correction." In response, we have found that maintaining the market is the top priority during the tense situation. Your Municipal Council will definitely sympathize. The people's payment of water and electricity bills is indeed an obligation that should be fulfilled. However, at present, it is impossible to withdraw cash. As long as checks can be used, checks will not have the same credit as banknotes. Naturally, refusing checks is also a last resort. There is no malice in this. We are still worried about whether we can notify the French water and electricity company to understand the actual situation and allow the use of checks, and everyone will be grateful.
