### What is the Most Effective Work for National Salvation During Summer Vacation?

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Speech

[Jiujiang] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, via the Kuling telephone, issued a statement on the 15th to solicit summer rural service students, titled "What is the most effective work for national salvation during summer vacation?". The original text is as follows:

Important Responsibility of Young Students

If we want to save the nation and revitalize our people, we must first promote spiritual development and restore our inherent national morality. We must reform all past habits of selfishness, cowardice, hypocrisy and chaos to become a united, loyal, brave and orderly nation. Such an important task cannot be accomplished overnight. We need long-term effort and an indomitable spirit to achieve our goals. Who should bear such an important task? I believe this is the responsibility of the whole nation. Every citizen must have this awareness in order to work together to successfully revitalize our nation. However, to make all citizens have such a thorough awareness, we must have a group of people who lead by example to do the work of awakening the deaf and arousing the dull. This kind of enterprise of leading the masses is a major mission of a group of young people, especially a group of young students. For such an important responsibility, young people have an inescapable and unavoidable duty. Premier Sun said, "The purpose of life is to serve, not to take." When young people are studying at school, it is a period of gaining benefits. If they only know how to gain benefits and do not know how to prepare for future production, then they are simply cultivating social worms. Therefore, today's university and middle school students in China must first establish a correct view of life during their studies, second, they must recognize the actual life of Chinese society and its diseases and shortcomings to do their best to study, and third, they must use their spare time to learn production skills and the work of transforming society and building rural areas. The meaning of the "Student Summer Rural Service" advocated by the New Life Movement General Association is to make our students across the country rise up together and bear the responsibility of revitalizing the nation. Of course, we are well aware that the service work done by students during the summer vacation is not much, but this is the beginning of the students' spiritual construction.

The great advance of development is like the activation of spring after a long period of severe frost. Young people's outlook on life is gradually showing a positive trend, knowing the reality of society, the suffering of the people, and the difficulty of material resources, and understanding the natural duty of serving life. What a valuable piece of news this is!

National Salvation Work is Serving the Countryside

Speaking of construction work, China has urgent needs everywhere. Because our material civilization is very backward, we must catch up in order to stand side by side with the great powers. Seeing that our various construction undertakings in recent years have also achieved considerable results, but if we go to the countryside to take a look, we can understand how bankrupt the rural economy is and how difficult the lives of farmers are. If our rural areas and the lives of farmers are not improved one day, our revolution and our work of revitalizing the nation cannot be considered complete one day. Therefore, rural construction is the most important foundation of various construction undertakings. We should recognize that rural service is the starting point for construction undertakings. If someone believes that young people cannot save the nation in any way except by studying during their school days, this is an extremely serious mistake. It must be known that there are various ways to save the nation. The most important thing is that everyone can do their duty, everyone can use their time without wasting a minute, and everyone can identify their goals and move straight forward. In other words, everyone can contribute their talents to society and the people as much as possible, and this is the essence of national salvation. For example, if students are willing to use their spare time to serve in the countryside and work hard, that is true national salvation work. Moreover, the international situation is deteriorating day by day, and the people's livelihood is becoming more urgent day by day. If we continue to follow the old ways as before and miss the opportunity, I am afraid it will be too late to regret it. The work of revival should "start with the big picture and work on the small details." Don't think that the work of rural service is trivial and difficult, but the meaning of our implementation of service is very profound and great. I believe that young people are the most ambitious and blood-heated people, and at the appropriate time, they will be able to rise up in time. Anyone who can go to the countryside to serve must be an ambitious young person, and anyone who can sacrifice their personal comfort to help others must be a first-class personality with blood. They are not for fame or for profit, they are for doing the basic work of revitalizing the nation. This kind of student who has undergone practical training will surely recognize the actual situation of society and gain countless experiences when they graduate and go to society, be able to fight against evil forces, and not be corrupted by the tide. China needs to produce more of this kind of student to have a solution. The education authorities must be able to educate this kind of student to be considered a success in education. This is the meaning of our advocacy of students going to the countryside to serve. (To be continued)

### Li Xing Visits Mei Weiliang to Discuss Anti-Smuggling

[Tianjin] Li Xing, Director-General of the Ministry of Finance's Land Transport Anti-Smuggling Inspectorate, returned to Tianjin on the 15th after seeking instructions from Nanjing. He immediately visited Customs Commissioner Mei Weiliang to discuss joint efforts to crack down on smuggled goods. Furthermore, the Customs' Xiaoximen branch post in the suburbs of Tianjin was previously occupied by ronin for three days and nights, taking the opportunity to transport large quantities of smuggled goods to outside towns. The Customs, punishing this matter, decided to form an armed anti-smuggling team to guard the post. At the end of last month, it intercepted more than two thousand bags of smuggled sugar, which was auctioned by the Customs for 80,000 yuan and reported to the ministry. (Special dispatch, 15th)

[Tianjin] The first batch of twenty-seven Tianjin merchants who registered smuggled goods have been inspected by the Customs, and they are being handled by recording 70% into the books and paying 30% in supplementary taxes. (Special dispatch, 15th)

### National Government Issues Order to Reduce Sentence for Zhao Qingming, Convicted of Murdering Qiang Yi

### Current Commentary

### Developing the Southwest and Completing the Hunan-Guizhou Railway

‚Äî Star

Since the Beijing-Yunnan tour group completed its journey of tens of thousands of miles, the attention of the Chinese people has been focused on the issue of Southwest development. Furthermore, the transportation links between Guizhou and the southeastern provinces have become the focus of attention for those who discuss economic development and national defense construction. On the 10th of this month, a long-distance telephone call between Beijing and Guizhou officially began operating. Beijing and Guizhou can talk in the same room. According to the Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th of this month, the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, which connects Zhuzhou, Hunan, and Guiyang, Guizhou, has been decided to begin construction in the autumn of this year. The Ministry of Railways has ordered that it be completed by the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China. Furthermore, the Sichuan-Guizhou and Sichuan-Yunnan railways, which run north from Guiyang to Chengdu and west to Kunming, have also been surveyed and will continue to be built. The completion of this major artery across the country will not only have a great effect on political unification and resource development, but also have important significance and value for establishing national defense and building a base for the revival of the nation.

The Hunan-Guizhou Railway is the most important trunk line in "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Five-Year Railway Plan." According to the Minister of Railways, Zhang Jiaao, the five-year plan includes fourteen new railways, totaling 8,140 kilometers. The Hunan-Guizhou route runs from Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Xinhua, Chenxi, Zhijiang, Yuping, Qingxi, Longli to Guiyang, reaching 1,000 kilometers. Except for 5%, which is in the plains, 95% passes through high mountains and ridges. The construction is difficult, twice as difficult as the Ping-Sui, Guangdong-Han, and Chengdu-Chongqing roads. A section within Hunan Province was personally designated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and a section within Guizhou Province coincides with the route taken by this tour group. In terms of economics, this route has antimony, tungsten, tin, coal, iron, mercury, and other mineral products nearby, as well as forest, cotton, tea, hemp, tobacco, and other agricultural products. Rich natural resources are waiting to be developed. In terms of transportation, this route is the only shortcut to open up the southeast and southwest. It is connected to the Ping-Zhu, Yu-Ping, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways to the east, reaching Beijing and Shanghai directly. Connecting to the Guangdong-Han railway can reach Guangdong and Guangxi and the Yangtze River Basin. In the future, when Guizhou and Yunnan are completed and connected to the Yunnan-Chengdu railway, Shanghai and Annam can be connected without relying on sea routes.

However, the importance of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway is more political and defensive than economic. As Minister He Yingqin said on the 10th of this month, "Because of the use of transportation, the central and local political situations are more closely linked." The factual political unification must be promoted through transportation construction. In recent years, the government's efforts in the Southwest transportation network and the opening of air and highway networks have been very active. And its effect has been clearly manifested in politics. In terms of national defense, because the Southwest is the base for our national revival, it not only has rich mineral resources and geographical advantages, but also is close to the mouths of the Indian Ocean. If there is a railway connection between Kunming and Myanmar, the traffic between the Pacific and Indian Oceans can be shortened. In the event of war on the Pacific coast, our coastal provinces along the Yangtze River will be wide open and difficult to defend. If we are unfortunate enough to retreat to the southwest, we can also get a route to international seaports. Therefore, some people call the Hunan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Yunnan routes "the last lifeline of the Chinese nation," which is not an exaggeration.

The experience gained by the government in national defense construction in the past seven or eight years clearly shows that first, choosing the last base for the nation, the southeast is not as good as the northwest, and the northwest is not as good as the southwest, because the northwest has no seaports and no sufficient food and other resources, so Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi are our last base. Second, the base should be linked to the coastal provinces along the Yangtze River. Highways and air routes cannot replace railways, because according to the principles of transportation, highways are only suitable for short-distance transportation and the delivery of small quantities of goods. Air transport is only suitable for the rapid delivery of valuable goods. When it comes to heavy responsibility, long distance, speed, and safety, railways are the best, and railways are more conducive to military transportation. The Soviet Union's Far East defense construction first paid attention to the double-tracking of the Siberian Railway. Japan is also eager to build railways on the front line of Heilongjiang. The motives are no different.

Therefore, the construction of the Southwest railway network is the basic work of national revival, and the Hunan-Guizhou Railway is the main artery of this railway network. From the reports of the members of the Beijing-Yunnan tour group, we know that the current road conditions in the southwest cannot meet the requirements of national defense. We hope that the Hunan-Guizhou road can be completed as soon as possible, opening a way out for the Chinese nation in the towering mountains of the southwest.

### Kong Xiangxi's Group's European Inspection Covers a Wide Range

Including Light and Heavy Industries, Medicine and Health, Economy and Taxation Systems. Part of the Delegation Returns Home, Part Follows Kong to the United States.

[Berlin] Vice President Kong convened members of the special envoy delegation today and gave a final speech, giving instructions on continuing to inspect the economic and industrial conditions of various European countries. Vice President Kong, together with a small number of the special envoy delegation, such as Guo Bingwen, counselor, Chen Bingzhang, Chen Liting, Yang Guangshun, Li Junyao, commissioner, will take the Mary Queen ship from Cherbourg, France to New York on the 16th and return to Germany within three weeks. The reports of the members of the special envoy delegation who have special missions can be completed after returning to China. After participating in the coronation ceremony of the British King, the delegation members engaged in the study of the economic conditions of various European countries, such as the income tax system, tax organizations, chemical industry, medical industry, and especially the detailed study of social diseases and their prevention and elimination methods. Other heavy industries, such as steel, aircraft factories, and railway management, have also been carefully investigated, so that they can contribute to the government after returning to China. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)

[Berlin] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, led several Chinese military attach√©s to Doublitz, near the capital, today to visit the Olympic Village. The village was used to accommodate athletes from various countries during last year's Games and has now been converted into a military camp. Subsequently, a representative of General Von Blomberg, the German Minister of Defense, accompanied them to visit military exercises, in which many tanks participated. Vice President Kong and the Chinese military attach√©s were very interested. If there were any unclear points in the various stages of the exercise, the military attach√©s would explain them. Cheng Tianfang, the Chinese ambassador to Germany, also accompanied Kong to visit the scene today. Furthermore, General Von Blomberg, the German Minister of Defense, had just returned from Italy today and will host a banquet in the evening to welcome Vice President Kong and the important members of the Chinese delegation, and invite Cheng Tianfang, the Chinese ambassador, and important figures from the German military and political circles to accompany them. Vice President Kong may go to Bad Nauheim Hot Springs tomorrow for a short stay and then return to Berlin. Tomorrow evening, he will accompany Chen Shaokuan, the Chinese Minister of the Navy, Weng Wenhao, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and a few attendants to Cherbourg Port, France to board the British mail ship "Queen Mary" to the United States.

### The United States Pays Attention to the Chinese Market

Saying the Future is Very Hopeful

Seattle, Ingalls, an official of the Bureau of Domestic and Foreign Trade of the Department of Commerce, said in a speech to the Transportation Association here today that small countries will be the main markets for the United States to expand its trade with the Far East in the future. China's highway, railway, mining, factory, and power projects are developing, and more European and American industrial equipment will be needed. The United States' exports of raw materials and semi-finished products to China will decrease, and China will gradually be able to supply itself, but it still needs European and American heavy industrial products. Ingalls continued that the United States wants to develop the export trade of manufactured products to Japan, hoping that at least the US-Philippines trade is still difficult to predict.

### Forty-Hour Work Week in the Textile Industry

Labor Conference Did Not Pass

[Geneva] The Textile Industry Committee of the International Labor Conference continued to meet today to discuss the establishment of an international convention stipulating the implementation of a forty-hour work week in the textile industry. The representatives of the Chinese, Japanese, and Indian employers clearly opposed it. Subsequently, at the suggestion of Armstrong, the representative of the New Zealand government, the committee decided to add another clause to the draft convention, stipulating that in some countries, longer working hours than forty hours may be implemented. (Havas dispatch, 14th, Central News Agency)

[Geneva] Bao Huaguo, the representative of the Chinese government, said that the Chinese government, in principle, supports the forty-hour work week, but it is not convenient to implement it. There are many reasons, the most important of which is that in some places in China, consular jurisdiction is still practiced. Nie Guangyu, the representative of the Chinese employers, said that the Chinese employers cannot accept the forty-hour work week, and said that this system is difficult to implement in the current fierce competition, because Japanese investment in the Chinese textile industry accounts for 40%, while British investment only accounts for 5%.

### Japan Actively Expands Production and Develops Large Industrial Zone in Korea

Operating Seventy-Two Factories with 500,000 Workers, Planning to Integrate Economy and Military Preparations

[Nanjing] Expanding production capacity has become Japan's biggest goal today, and various reform issues arise from this. The common slogan of the military and the munitions industry is that without expanding production capacity, it is impossible to enrich national defense. Along with the continuous development of Japan's heavy industry, the plan to create a huge industrial belt in Korea has also been formulated. No matter from any standpoint, it is extremely important. Korea will eventually become the most important area of the Japanese Empire. Last year, the capital of new industries in Japan headquarters reached 800 million yuan, and for the first four months of this year, it was about 310 million yuan. Last year, the capital increase of old industries totaled 120 million yuan, and this year it has reached 450 million yuan in the first four months. These figures fully indicate Japan's active efforts to expand production capacity. It is reported that Japan will set up new industrial companies in Korea. The ones under consideration are 25 cotton yarn and rayon factories, 13 chemical industries, 3 various trade companies, 8 heavy industries, 3 cement industries, 7 electrical industries, 2 aquatic and forest industries, and 12 steel plants, totaling 73 locations, with a total capital of about 100 million yuan. This company is expected to be built in two or three years, requiring about 500,000 workers. When the Korean giant industrial belt is completed, the so-called national defense government advocated by the military will reach the final stage of completion. The military will propose this year a five-year plan for industries closely related to national defense, and the above-mentioned procedures are only a part of this plan. In addition, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is now planning to train 500,000 skilled workers to serve in important departments of the munitions industry. This level is extremely noteworthy, because it is inextricably linked to the expansion of production capacity and the improvement of manufacturing technology. Regarding the statistics of physical examinations for army recruits, which show the trend of weakening national physical strength, the army authorities have recently felt uneasy and are trying to improve the situation. Therefore, they are now considering drafting the "Unified National Physical Strength Law," stipulating that from newborn babies to 40-year-old adults, they must be forced to undergo physical examinations. Everyone will be issued a registration form. Babies from six months old will be subject to physical examinations by the city, town, and village authorities. All children who have reached school age will be examined by the primary school authorities. From primary school graduation to the age of 40, the city, town, and village authorities will re-examine them. People who have not reached the enlistment age will be examined once a year, and those who have passed the enlistment age will be examined once every three years. The records of the physical examinations must be noted in the registration book. This plan can not only prevent people from intentionally evading conscription obligations, but also use the power of the government to promote people to voluntarily improve their physical fitness in order to prepare for the general mobilization of the people of the whole country. From this point of view, the spirit of Japanese statism, whether it has been realized or is about to be realized, has spread everywhere, and it is not limited to politics or economics. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)

### Japan-‚ÄúManchukuo‚Äù Economic Plan

Highly Significant

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro of Japan, due to the economic development plan of Japan and Manchukuo as one body passed by the Cabinet today, which is of extremely important nature, after the Cabinet meeting, went to the Imperial Palace to report to the Emperor and obtained the Emperor's approval. The government today only announced the outline of the plan. This is a national economic policy of Japan that has epoch-making significance. In the past, Japan had fully implemented the spirit of Japan and Manchukuo as one in the military, political, and diplomatic spheres, but regarding the economic aspect, those who advocated taking Manchukuo as a unit and establishing a national socialist utopia separately in Manchukuo were very powerful. Therefore, the above proposal not only had serious friction with general capitalists, but also would make it impossible for Japan's controlled economy to be satisfactorily realized. However, the situation after the February 26th Incident showed that the implementation of high-level national defense and national socialism in Japan proper had become an unstoppable trend. Therefore, it was necessary to quickly eliminate the opposition and friction between the policies of the Japanese government and the policies implemented in Manchukuo. The Manchukuo Industrial Five-Year Plan announced at the end of last year, and the Manchukuo Controlled Important Industries Law enacted on May 1st of this year, have both begun. This law emphasizes the economic unity of Japan and Manchukuo to meet the needs of completing the high-level national defense of the entire Japanese Empire. Since the formation of the Konoe Cabinet, Finance Minister Kaya Okinori and Commerce Minister Yoshino Shinji have repeatedly emphasized the necessity of economic unity between Japan and Manchukuo. The Cabinet's passage of the above-mentioned proposal today makes Manchukuo in principle and in practice a part of Japan's entire controlled economy. Furthermore, this resolution contains another important significance, that is, since the Hayashi Cabinet, Japan has planned to establish an Imperial Economic Conference, with representatives from the Kwantung Army, the Korean Army, the Taiwan Army, the Sakhalin Political Bureau, the Ministry of the Army, the Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry attending, to formulate a unified and adjusted plan for the source of raw materials, market finance, and finance of Japan, Korea, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, and Southern Sakhalin. However, Manchukuo, because it is not nominally a part of the Japanese Empire, cannot join the conference. Now that the policy of developing the economic power of Japan and Manchukuo as one body has been announced, it is possible that the economic production and distribution between Japan and its colonies can be integrated, and the mobilization of the controlled economy and high-level national defense can be carried out in accordance with the comprehensive plan formulated solely by the Japanese government. However, although the political foundation for the Japan-Manchukuo economic group that Japan has long dreamed of has been completed due to today's resolution, there is still a fundamental problem that hinders its realization, that is, the funds needed for the development and publication of the Asian economy are far from being as easy to raise as the Japanese government imagines. This is also sufficient to fully indicate that the expansion of productivity in Japan proper and the resulting increase in import surpluses have caused financial shortages and financial difficulties, which have become the most serious problem, according to the Central News Agency (May 15th).

### Japanese Cabinet Decides on Financial and Economic Policies

Striving to Avoid Forced Economic Control, Strengthening Economic Ties between Japan and Manchukuo

[Tokyo] The Cabinet met from 10:30 this morning, first Prime Minister Konoe put forward a proposal to enrich and develop Japan's economic power, requesting cabinet members to pass it, and Finance Minister Kaya gave a detailed explanation. Later, each cabinet member expressed their opinions, and it ended at 12:25 p.m., when the fundamental principles of financial and economic policies were decided, with the Planning Agency as the center, connecting the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and other ministries, as well as the Central Economic Conference and the Price Countermeasures Committee, etc., in order to promote its concretization. As for the method, geographically, Japan and "Manchukuo" are regarded as one, and in terms of time, it is three to five years, striving to avoid forced economic control, waiting for the autonomous control of the private sector, and planning to combine this comprehensive industrial plan with the national defense plan to become the fundamental way to implement national policy. The general outline is as follows:

„äÄ Liaison and control of industrial finance and tariff policies between Japan and "Manchukuo";

„äÅ Development of resources such as iron ore, coal mines, petroleum, and metals, and the invention and discovery of substitute raw materials;

„äÇ Determining self-sufficiency in cotton, wool, timber, food, and other products;

„äÉ Research should be carried out on cultivating skilled labor, rationalizing production processes, and increasing efficiency;

„äÑ Utilizing surplus labor in rural areas, adjusting the supply and demand of materials;

„äÖ Rationalizing the material distribution mechanism;

„äÖ Reviewing the Important Industries Control Law and other economic laws and regulations;

„äá Rationalizing budget preparation;

„äà Adjusting the distribution method due to tax system reorganization;

„äâ Reorganizing and controlling financial institutions;

„äâ„äÄ Controlling investment, saving consumption, and balancing international payments;

„äâ„äÅ Determining fundamental policies to increase exports;

„äâ„äÇ Preventing the import of non-urgent and unnecessary goods;

„äâ„äÉ Strengthening exchange management;

„äâ„äÑ Policies for transporting cash and producing gold;

„äâ„äÖ Policies to improve shipping and other non-trade income and expenditure;

After the Cabinet meeting adjourned, Finance Minister Kaya told people the following: The fundamental policy announced this time is very broad and complex. The government, in view of the current situation, believes that it cannot be actively implemented without the unanimous assistance of officials and the public. From the perspective of the country as a whole, policies are implemented with the overall interests as the main focus, without bias to any part. There is no consideration of favoring one over the other in taxation. It is deeply concerned about the welfare of the people and plans to find ways to make up for its shortcomings. At the same time, it also intends to consider the material and human aspects of this policy, such as the supply and demand of materials and the assistance of labor. In terms of regions, in order to realize the plan of unifying Japan and "Manchukuo", it should strive to avoid the control of the oppressive economy and wait for the national consciousness to seek progress. In the future, in order to make this policy concrete, a committee will be established with the Planning Agency as the center, with each province coordinating with each other. It is also unknown whether it will be established. The Price Countermeasures Committee must also be closely linked with the Central Economic Conference. The budget preparation for the next year has been approaching, and it is planned to quickly establish a concrete plan to facilitate the implementation. The fourth shipment of cash has been issued, and it is not yet known whether the fifth shipment will be sent within the year. I believe that the shipment of cash is indeed to maintain the exchange rate level, and it will never give the people anxiety, etc.

The government has now decided to send the fourth cash shipment to the United States, totaling approximately 50 million yuan. The first shipment, approximately 17 million yuan, is scheduled to be loaded on the Narutomaru, which will set sail on the 16th to the United States. According to the Japanese Ministry of Finance's cash outflow, this is the fourth time. The previous three shipments of gold have reached 160 million yuan. After the current 50 million yuan of the fourth shipment is completed, the total amount will reach the same amount as the estimated amount of new gold production this year. It is heard that the government believes that if necessary, it will implement the fifth cash shipment. Army Minister Sugiyama told people the following after the Cabinet meeting adjourned: The policy of enriching economic power and its development strategy determined at today's Cabinet meeting considers the industries indispensable for the people's livelihood, enriches them, and establishes trade relations. It is by no means only aimed at national defense, but also expands productivity. Its significance is not only in expanding industrial capacity, but also in summarizing all industries, and mobilizing the entire people to cooperate. This plan should be linked to the economic alliance between Japan and Manchukuo, and should be linked to the industrial five-year plan currently being implemented by "Manchukuo". In the process of implementation, depending on the department, the Japanese side may follow the plan of the country, or the country may follow the plan of the Japanese side. Although there are difficulties in implementation, the national defense enrichment plan cannot be changed due to its difficulties. It is not yet determined when this matter can be completed. It can generally be completed in fiscal year Showa 17, which will be completed in the same way as the "Manchukuo" Five-Year Plan. This is what we hope, etc. The Governor-General of Korea has now established the fundamental policy of industrial and economic policies, and will convene a Korean-Manchukuo Industrial and Economic Liaison Conference in early August with this conference as a prerequisite. The session is scheduled for three days, with the goal of developing economic strategies to promote comprehensive construction. The conference will be attended by representatives from the Embassy in Manchukuo, the South Manchuria Railway Company, the Kwantung Bureau, and the "Manchukuo" government, etc. (Kyodo News, 15th)

[Nanjing] There are currently four Japanese commercial officers stationed abroad, and the number will soon double. Commercial officers will be stationed in all newly opened Japanese goods markets. In the future, commercial officers will be jointly managed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Reuters, Central News Agency, 15th).

### French Cabinet Passes Financial Relief Measures

Requests Parliament to Grant Full Powers, Finance Minister Bitterly Criticizes Speculators

[Paris] After the State Council met this morning, a communiqu√© was issued stating that the State Council had unanimously passed the financial measures proposed by Finance Minister Auriol, and decided to request Parliament to allow the government to issue various measures by decree within a very short period of time, in order to seek financial recovery and prevent attacks on people's savings and public credit. Regarding this request, the bill drafted by the government will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, and the Chamber of Deputies is requested to discuss it immediately. The Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to meet this afternoon to review the government's financial plan, and various political parties will also meet separately in the afternoon to decide on the attitude to be taken. The general public hopes that the Chamber of Deputies will quickly pass the government's financial plan, so that the plan can be submitted to the Senate for discussion on Thursday of this week.

[Paris] The financial bill submitted by the government to Parliament contains only one article, which is to request Parliament to grant full power over financial and monetary matters, so that the government can take various necessary measures through the State Council in the form of orders to seek financial recovery, protection of savings deposits, and increase of public credit. This order shall be submitted to Parliament for ratification within three months after the passage of this bill, or submitted to Parliament for ratification within the term of the current extraordinary session of Parliament. According to those responsible, the government's method of restoring finances should be as follows: „äÄ Increase stamp duty and tobacco tax; „äÅ Each railway budget should be forced to offset its income and expenditure. Therefore, in the future, each railway will be able to increase ticket prices. At the same time, the Ministry of Public Works will soon submit a bill to reorganize the management of railways throughout the country, etc.

[Paris] After the government submitted the financial plan to Parliament and requested to be granted full financial power, most members of the Chamber of Deputies commented on it. Among them, there were also many members of the majority party who raised objections to this plan, especially members of the right-wing Radical Party and the Socialist Union Party, which is between the Radical Party and the Socialist Party. As for the members of the Communist Party, although many of them took a reserved attitude, it is generally believed that the party will vote in favor of the government bill, so that the Cabinet can obtain a large majority. Also, after the State Council adjourned this morning, Finance Minister Auriol declared that the government had formulated various plans to reform the finances of various cities and regions, establish a new railway system, and relieve agricultural disasters. At present, the government's finances are under attack by speculators, and the situation is exactly the same as in 1934 to 1926 (that is, before the late Prime Minister Poincar√© stabilized the franc) and from May 1935 to May 1936. What the government has decided is to restore the balance of finances with prudence and firmness, and to destroy the attacks of speculators. Since January of this year, bank savings deposits have increased rather than decreased, and the bonds issued by the Pension Fund Management Bureau have also been subscribed very enthusiastically, which shows that the financial situation is very stable. The reason why there is turmoil is all caused by speculators. When we took office, the situation was very difficult, and the people of the country can still remember it. At that time, the amount of railway operating losses increased year by year, and local finances were also often short. The amount of the national treasury used to repay war-time debts accounted for 50% of the total, and the national defense expenditure reached a huge amount of 9,000,000,000 francs per year. At the same time, 6,000,000,000 francs of domestic funds flowed out of the country. If all French people can fulfill their responsibilities, we have nothing to worry about, but there are quite a few people who value private interests, etc. The Minister of Finance then recalled the various measures taken to restore finances since taking office, and said, "All these measures are due to speculators starting to act, and newspapers fueling the flames, issuing pessimistic remarks, so the government had to do it. You must know that if these speculators want to put us to death, we will never sit still and wait for death," etc. (Havas News Agency, Central News Agency, 15th)

### US Senate Committee Insists on Judicial Independence

Rejects Roosevelt's Reform Plan, Date of Senate Discussion Undetermined

[Washington] The Senate Judiciary Committee today reported to the Senate and rejected President Roosevelt's plan to reform the federal judicial system and expand the Supreme Court. According to the resolution of the Judiciary Committee, it is the biggest obstacle the case has encountered since it was proposed by the President. The Committee stated in its report to the Senate that the so-called judicial reform plan is a cover-up of the true intentions of the government. If the case is passed, the American rule of law system will be shaken, and the Supreme Court will be forced to illegally obey the will of the administrative authorities. From then on, the constitutional guarantee that the executive branch must not be autocratic will be completely extinct, etc. Chairman Ashurst of the Committee originally opposed the case, but now suddenly turned to support it, but the result of this case was still rejected, which was mostly due to the efforts of Senator King, (National News Agency, 14th)

[Washington] The Senate Judiciary Committee today issued a report on President Roosevelt's Supreme Court reform plan with harsh condemnation, believing that the President's proposal is "unnecessary, meaningless, and extremely dangerous to abandoning constitutional principles, and conceals its true intentions in a complicated way," and advocating that "it should be severely rejected, so that such a proposal will not be submitted to the free representatives of the free people of the United States again," etc. The reasons for opposition cited in the report are five: „äÄ It cannot achieve its commonly declared purpose; „äÅ It abuses power in the judiciary, causing the court to lose its independent dignity; „äÇ It violates all historical precedents of the US government and establishes a dangerous precedent; „äÉ It directly violates the spirit of the Constitution; „äÑ It tends to expand political power to the judicial branch, etc. The main drafters of this report are Democratic senators King, McCarran, and O'Mahoney, etc., but when the Senate will formally debate the case has not yet been indicated, (Reuters, Central News Agency, 14th)

### British Imperial Conference Closed Yesterday

Hoping for Separation of Covenant and Treaty, Promoting Pacific Pact

[London] The British Imperial Conference held a closing ceremony this morning. Prime Minister Chamberlain thanked the representatives of the various autonomous regions, and said that he deeply believed that this Imperial Conference was beneficial to all parts of the Empire.

King George VI then issued an edict thanking the representatives of the various autonomous regions, and his words said, "We and the Queen have heard and are deeply pleased by the generous tone and goodwill expressed in your memorandum," etc. At this point, the Imperial Conference passed a large number of reports on the various issues discussed over the past few weeks, among which the report on foreign affairs included the following main points:

„äÄ The governments of the British Empire share the same hope for the expansion of the scope of the member states of the League of Nations and the increase in the momentum of the League of Nations. For this reason, they jointly express the opinion that it is only by separating the League of Nations Covenant from the various peace treaties after the Great War that it is easy to achieve the above-mentioned goals.

„äÅ Various regional agreements that can contribute to peace and do not conflict with the League of Nations Covenant are welcomed by the representatives of the Imperial Conference.

„äÇ The representatives of the Imperial Conference acknowledge that the proposal for a non-aggression pact between the countries of the Pacific Ocean is extremely important to the cause of peace. If this pact is possible, consultations should be continued.

„äÉ In order to restore confidence and promote the economic and financial stability of countries around the world, the representatives of the Imperial Conference specifically stated that they are prepared to cooperate with other countries to discuss the current difficulties, thereby promoting international trade and improving general living standards, etc. (Havas News Agency, Central News Agency, 15th)

### Spanish Civil War Rebels Win Victories on All Sides After a Year

Bilbao Still Holds the Center, Rebels Attack Santander Again

‚äô Bilbao The Spanish Civil War will enter its twelfth month this Thursday. Currently, the Nationalists seem to be gradually gaining the upper hand. The Nationalists have penetrated deep near Bilbao, and their Commander-in-Chief General Franco has launched a new offensive against Santander. General Miaja, the commander of the government forces in central Spain, has ordered all civilians in Madrid to evacuate. The situation in Bilbao is precarious. At 6:00 p.m. tonight, the British warship Campbell Field sent a team of troops to land in Bilbao to escort the British consul onto the ship. The radio communication between the British consul and the warship has now been stopped. The British destroyer Polypos is currently docked in the port of Santander, and it is said that it also intends to send troops to land to escort the British consul and the British expatriates in the port onto the ship. The Bilbao radio station was silent today, which was very strange. Later, it was learned that the radio station had been occupied by the Nationalists. The radio station is located on Mount Achanda, from which the summit can overlook Bilbao. Tonight, 20,000 women, children, and men over the age of military service in Bilbao took heavy trucks, merchant ships, minesweepers, fishing boats, etc., to Santander by land and water. Basque Autonomous Region President Dr. Aguirre has appealed to British Foreign Secretary Eden, requesting the British Navy to protect the residents of the city from danger before the rebels bombard Bilbao. The British government has granted permission. It is heard that as of 7:00 a.m. this morning, the Nationalists have captured 4,000 people, including Colonel Valdich, an important member of the deployment of Bilbao's defenses. General Franco personally commanded the offensive. The Nationalists who had been fighting for a long time were replaced by newly arrived reinforcements. Spanish ambassadors, ministers, and consuls-general from all over the world have been ordered to return to Valencia, and will hold a secret meeting with Foreign Minister Giral today. The purpose has not been revealed. General Franco has recently moved his headquarters to Burgos, and launched a new offensive against Santander early this morning, with the important road intersections of Espinosa, Tras, and Monteros as the target of attack. Today, rumors say that Dr. Aguirre has established a headquarters in Laredo, midway between Bilbao and Santander, and that the Basque government has moved there. However, the Basque government is still holding meetings in Bilbao, which shows the incredibility of the rumors. According to the Basque Gazette, the Basque cabinet members unanimously decided to stay in Bilbao and defend it to the end. Their views are completely in line with the Army General Staff, etc. The Nationalists are still engaged in suppressing Bilbao, and airplanes are throwing bombs almost continuously, and machine guns are strafing the civilians running away in the streets, causing numerous deaths. Residents of Madrid are ordered to leave the city immediately, and will now withdraw in batches. First, residents of various provinces are to be relocated, followed by the capital, and finally the countryside, (Reuters News Agency, Central News Agency, 14th)

Road Widening Rescheduled to Begin

The county government's widening of the road south of Puzhao Temple was originally scheduled to begin on the 1st of this month, but the houses on both sides were not demolished within the time limit, and a request was submitted to postpone the start of construction. The county government approved the request and rescheduled the start of construction to the 16th. The houses on both sides have now been completely demolished.

### Changshu

Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Director Accused

Li Huchen, the director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Office in this county, assumed his position last November, taking over tax collection, which was originally a contracted undertaking.  At the beginning of his tenure, he collected funds from various sources, ranging from four to five hundred yuan to a minimum of one to two hundred yuan, totaling twelve thousand yuan, to secure his current position. However, before collecting the funds, he used positions such as section chief and inspector as bargaining chips with creditors.  Consequently, many people like Pu Ou and Mei Ke held positions.  Unexpectedly, after taking office, the number of available positions was insufficient, resulting in a situation of too many monks and not enough gruel, offending many people.  Creditors such as Wu Zihou have jointly filed a lawsuit to recover their debts. The court has scheduled a hearing for the 22nd of this month.

### Suzhou

Appointment of Director of Public Property Office

Zhang Yipeng, Director of the Wu County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office, submitted his resignation to the county government. The county government approved it on the 15th and appointed Wang Ji, the current Deputy Director of the Relief Home, to fill the vacancy. Xu Junlie was appointed as the Deputy Director of the Relief Home.

County Chamber of Commerce Urges Expansion of Main Roads

The Wu County Construction Bureau is widening the ten main roads in the city, and the shops and residences along these roads have been demolished and vacated. The Construction Bureau invited merchants to bid for the road widening project and opened the bids on the 5th of this month. After submitting the results to the Construction Department for approval, the Construction Department rejected the bids due to the excessive bid prices. Director Cao of the Construction Bureau convened a meeting of construction contractors on the 15th to discuss reducing construction costs, preparing to resubmit the plan to the Construction Department for review. On the 15th, it was submitted to a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, which resolved to submit it separately to the Construction Department and the County Government, and to send a letter to the Construction Bureau, requesting that the project proceed as soon as possible according to the original plan, in order to alleviate the difficulties faced by merchants.

### Wuxi

Bus Overturns on the Wuxi-Shanghai Line

The No. 47 bus of the Wuxi-Shanghai Long-Distance Bus Company departed from Changshu at 8:25 a.m. on the 15th, fully loaded with passengers, heading towards Wuxi.  At 9:45 a.m., while traveling between the No. 3 and No. 4 bridges west of Dongting in Wuxi, the bus encountered muddy ground, making it difficult to drive. Driver Jiang Jinchu, due to a moment of carelessness, caused the bus to overturn, with the wheels facing the sky and the bus lying across the road. The forty-odd passengers in the bus were all thrown about inside the vehicle.  Onlookers, upon seeing the accident, immediately rushed forward and broke the glass on the bus door, then rescued the passengers one by one. Upon learning of the accident, Sun Shikang, the stationmaster of the Wuxi station, immediately used a large passenger bus to transport the injured to the Puren Clinic and the Brothers Hospital for treatment. The doctors at both hospitals treated and bandaged the injured according to the severity of their injuries. Currently, the seriously injured include Zhu Kun, Jiang Axi, Wang Ruisheng, and Shi Minyong, a total of five people. The slightly injured include Li Canglong, Wang Changmei, Gu Wenhu, and Zhou Pu, a total of twenty-four people. Afterwards, Sun Baokang, the stationmaster of the Wuxi station, took a bus again at around 1 p.m. to inspect the overturned vehicle. He also ordered road maintenance workers and mechanics to lift the overturned vehicle and tow it to Changshu for repairs using the No. 9 passenger bus. It is said that the loss from this accident is estimated to be over ten thousand yuan.

Good Sales of Raw Silk

This year's spring cocoon season has already ended. Silk factories in urban and rural areas have started operations, with a total of thirty-eight factories including Yongtai and Gansheng. In addition, Lun Chang, Yongcheng, and Yongxin will start operating around the 20th of this month. It is reported that the overseas silk market has been sluggish recently, and the sales of foreign silk have not improved. However, the sales of raw silk to domestic users have been quite good. This is because silk weaving manufacturers in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou, anticipating that the price of cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces would be quite high this year, and predicting that the silk market would definitely increase in the future, have been actively purchasing raw silk, causing the market price to rise steadily, with each bale worth over eight hundred yuan. Because this year's spring cocoons are of excellent quality and the reeling process is short, every 380 catties of dried cocoons can produce one dan of raw silk.

### Shanghai Machinery Industry Association Held 10th Anniversary Celebration Yesterday

Party and government representatives, including Wang Yansong, delivered speeches of encouragement and an Industrial Safety Statistics Exhibition was held.

The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Goods Factory Association held its 10th anniversary celebration and Industrial Safety Statistics Exhibition yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association. Guests from all walks of life were present, including Wang Yansong, representative of the Minister of the Central Department of People's Training, Cheng Tiangu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, Qin Hongji, representative of the Central Factory Inspection Office, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zheng Xuehai, representative of Acting Mayor Yu, Wang Jiyi, representative of the Garrison Command, Wu Huanru, representative of the Social Bureau, Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Huang Renzhi and Gui Yanfang of the Local Association, Cheng Haifeng of the International Labor Bureau, Lin Kanghou and He Dehui of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry, as well as Pan Xulun, Pan Yangyao, Wang Zhisheng, Jiang Peng, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Boqi, Tao Leqin, Ge Futian, Xiang Kangyuan, Xu Guanqun, Wang Xingyao, Chen Xingqing, Cheng Nianpeng and over 600 others. Cai Shengbai, Hu Xiyuan, Ren Shigang, Shen Jiucheng, and Lu Zhixue served as the presidium. The details are as follows:

Chairman's Speech

After the customary ceremonies, Chairman Cai Shengbai delivered the opening speech, reporting on the association's progress over the past ten years, stating that the association has been established for exactly ten years. He expressed his honor that central party and government officials, as well as municipal party and government officials, and gentlemen, had graced the event with their guidance. He also thanked the Shanghai newspapers for their editorials of praise and guidance, and the association's factories for their celebration advertisements in the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers. In addition, major stores on Nanjing Road and the association's factory outlets held large-scale sales to celebrate. He expressed his deep gratitude on behalf of the association at the commemorative meeting. As for the past situation of the annual meeting, he felt it was necessary to briefly describe it. The association was initially organized by 47 factories representing over 20 industries. At the beginning, everything was chaotic. From the organization of the preparatory committee, the formulation of regulations, the establishment of methods, and the agreement on the direction of progress, the association was officially established on June 15th, ten years ago. As for the work of the past ten years, it has been to reduce taxes, reduce transportation costs, improve accounting, and improve factory management. In general, it can be summarized as "hard work." Because we do things practically and realistically, we never use propaganda as a slogan. Therefore, our current priority is to do everything possible that is beneficial to our association's factories. Now, the number of factories in our association is increasing year by year. To date, there are over 300 factories, divided into 57 industries. The association's responsibilities and affairs are becoming more and more burdensome day by day. The factories of our association must recognize that the association is a members' association, not an association's association. Every action of the association is closely related to the members. Members must work together to ensure the association's sound development, which is the members' sound development. Only then will the commemorative ceremony be worthwhile. He also expressed the hope that government officials would provide more protection and guidance, and that all sectors of society would provide as much help and support as possible, so that the future of national goods would surely be bright and prosperous. National prosperity and people's well-being depend on concerted cooperation. Next, Hu Xiyuan, chairman of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparations for the commemorative meeting and the Industrial Safety Statistics Exhibition.

Wang Yansong's Speech

Wang Yansong, representative of Minister Chen of the Central Department of People's Training, delivered a speech, saying, "Chairman, gentlemen, today I am very honored to participate in your association's 10th anniversary celebration on behalf of Minister Chen of the Central Department of People's Training. When Minister Chen was previously the head of the Ministry of Industry, he was very concerned about the development of your members' businesses. Now that he is the Minister of People's Training, he is not only still very concerned about your members' businesses, but also very concerned about the soundness of your association's organization. Therefore, Minister Chen wanted to attend in person, but he was too busy with official duties and could not spare the time. Therefore, he specifically instructed me to attend on his behalf and say a few words. To make a country's machinery sound, it is necessary to ensure that all forces can develop equally, and then the entire country's strength can be generated. Only then can this country be called a modern country. The so-called various forces refer to the forces of various conditions for national survival, such as military strength, political strength, cultural strength, and even all agricultural, industrial, commercial, mining, and economic strengths. If all these forces can develop equally, then the country's strength will be generated, and then the country can become rich and strong. Our country is now so weak and has suffered the oppression and bullying of strong neighbors. This is because our various forces cannot be developed. Therefore, we should strive to move forward on the road to strengthening various forces in the future, especially in the economic field. Because China's industry is backward, the industrial sector bears a greater responsibility. I hope that you, gentlemen, will uphold the steadfast spirit of the past ten years and make greater contributions to the country and the nation. On the one hand, the government should do its best to protect and guide the industrial sector. On the other hand, the industrial sector should work hard in many areas, such as organization, management, technology, etc., and should continue to seek improvement. Then the strength of the industrial sector will increase day by day, and its contribution to the country and the nation will also increase day by day. Today, on behalf of Minister Chen, I wish you all great success here, and open up a bright path for our country's industrial sector. Finally, I personally have a suggestion, that is, I participated in the Jing-Dian Highway Week Exhibition and saw that there are too many businesses that can be done in the interior, especially the interior's industry, which is in its infancy and needs the industrial sector to develop. This is not only for the country and society, but also for the industrial sector itself to find a way out. I hope you will not abandon this responsibility, that is, do not abandon this opportunity."

Vice Minister Cheng's Speech

Vice Minister of Industry Cheng Tiangu delivered a speech, saying, "Today I am very honored to participate in your association's 10th anniversary celebration. I remember when I visited the exhibition in Hunan, I realized the importance of machinery products. China has always been a country that relies on agriculture, and has never paid attention to industrial manufacturing. Of the 400 million people, 300 million are engaged in agriculture. However, in the 20th century, a country cannot be established by agriculture alone. It must participate in industry. Agriculture is certainly necessary, but industry is also necessary. Agriculture and industry should develop in a balanced way. In recent years, due to the advocacy of the general public, China's industry has gradually developed. The central government has also appropriately reduced the tax burden on domestic goods factories. The government is in a guiding position, and the people are in a cooperative position. Only then can industry progress. There are some speculators who are constantly selling short and buying long, and do not use their energy and materials for legitimate businesses and welfare. This is the most hateful thing. Now our country has embarked on the road of revival. The government is vigorously promoting national economic construction. Although industry has only developed a little at present, it must cooperate with the government in the future in order to achieve greater results. Increasing production is to enrich national strength. I hope that your association will continue to work hard so that the people can fully use domestic goods."

Notes on Other Speeches

Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, stating that the association is a group of Chinese factories and that the development of industry is sufficient to increase social happiness, because industry includes everything from clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The members of the association are all in the machinery manufacturing industry, and the things needed by society in the future will gradually increase. How can we meet the needs of the public and recover our rights? We must pay attention to the construction of heavy industry in order to make the machinery manufacturing industry of light industry more developed. Zheng Xuehai, representative of Acting Mayor Yu of the Municipal Government, delivered a speech, stating that in order to achieve industrial prosperity, we must pay attention to several points: (1) Research the goods needed by society and improve the goods themselves, so as to benefit society and make industry itself more solid. (2) In order to make the products sell, we must pay attention to publicity. Why can foreign goods sell well in China? Most of it is due to publicity. In the interior, we can see advertisements for foreign goods. We should pay attention to this point. (3) In order to make goods trusted by people, in addition to publicity, we must have exhibitions so that people can recognize them. At the same time, we can observe what kind of goods people need. The Municipal Government will also hold a 10th anniversary celebration and has decided to hold an industrial exhibition. We hope that the factories of the association will all participate. Wang Jiyi, Xu Peihuang, He Dehui, and others also delivered speeches, which are omitted here. After the commemorative meeting, the presidium led the guests to visit the industrial exhibition and presented gifts.

Industrial Exhibition

The exhibition hall was located on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association and was divided into two major sections: industrial safety and industrial statistics. The safety exhibits were transferred from the Central Inspection Office of the Ministry of Industry. The industrial statistics were drawn by the association itself. The collection of factory building machinery, safety and health equipment, and statistics of goods in and out of the factory over the past ten years was very complete. It is reported that the exhibition period is from yesterday to the 21st of this month, a total of seven days. The opening hours are from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day. On Sundays, the opening hours are from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Admission is free and all sectors of society are welcome to visit.

Store Sales

This time, the association's factories with retail outlets held a one-day sale yesterday to celebrate the 10th anniversary. Major stores on Nanjing Road also decided in advance to hold a sale to show their congratulations. Therefore, the entrances of major stores on Nanjing Road yesterday were all pasted with slogans saying "Today we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Machinery Industry Association, and our store is holding a one-day sale." Shoppers were very enthusiastic.

### All Passengers Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, and the Haili Can Be Rescued Today

Haiyan and Haizhen Arrived in Port One After Another, and the Goods in the Fourth Cabin Were Carried Back by Yongsheng

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili ship hit a reef on the South Yushan Sea off the coast of Wenzhou, causing a breach in the rear hole of the fourth cabin. Fortunately, Captain Teng Shibiao used his rich experience to navigate out of this dangerous area among the chaotic reefs of South Yushan in the dense fog and darkness, and sailed to a beach on the coast of Taitou Mountain to run aground, so that the hull could be preserved and hundreds of people on board were safe. According to the crew members of the Haiyan who returned to Shanghai yesterday, the Haili was in an extremely dangerous position when it hit the reef. If Captain Teng had not been familiar with the terrain, the lives and property of the entire ship would have been lost. Therefore, Teng Shibiao deserves the credit for turning the danger into safety this time. The Haiyan, after the towboat of Wheelock Marden arrived on the scene on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, transferred the passengers on board to Shanghai. A total of 101 passengers were transferred by the Haiyan ship, and 134 passengers were transferred by the Haizhen ship, for a total of 235 passengers. Together with their luggage and other items, the Haiyan arrived in Shanghai early in the morning yesterday at 5:00 AM, and the Haizhen ship also arrived at 9:00 AM. All 235 rescued passengers disembarked and went home. The passengers who were rescued to Shanghai this time all looked happy and grateful to Captain Teng when they disembarked. The goods in the fourth cabin of the Haili have now been unloaded and carried back to Shanghai by the Yongsheng ship first. The area damaged by the reef is being repaired, so it is expected that the Haili may float out of the shallows today, be towed out by Wheelock Marden's towboat, and then be sent back to Shanghai for repairs at the factory. The loss of goods damaged by water this time is still light, but the cost of hiring Wheelock Marden's boat to tow the ship is 35,000 yuan. In addition, the ship will be delayed for at least a week, and the loss is estimated to be about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, but it is still a great blessing in misfortune.

### Yih Ho Yangtze Steamer "Jihe" Runs Aground at Tongzhou

Forecastle Pierced, River Water Rushes In; Company Dispatches Steamer to Salvage Passengers

China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haily" encountered an accident on the Wenzhou sea, and passengers were only rescued back to Shanghai yesterday. Now, the British Jardine Matheson's Yangtze steamer "Jihe" also suddenly ran aground at Tongzhou yesterday, its hull pierced and flooding. Fortunately, the passengers have been rescued. The details of the accident are described below.

"Jihe" Runs Aground at Tongzhou

The British Jardine Matheson's Yangtze liner "Jihe" has a total capacity of 2,665 tons and a registered tonnage of 1,924 tons. Built in 1895, its grand dining room and first-class cabins are beautifully equipped. It specializes in the Shanghai-Hankou route, with regular sailings every Monday and Thursday. This time, on the 14th night, it loaded cargo and passengers at the Gonghe Wharf. At 2:00 AM on the 15th, it set sail for Hankou with the rising tide. After leaving the Wusong estuary and heading up the Yangtze River, after about eight hours of journey, the ship approached Tongzhou. The Qingda Reef on the Tongzhou river is one of the most difficult sections for Yangtze River ships to navigate. A slight oversight can lead to running aground. When the "Jihe" reached this point, there was fog on the river. Due to the negligence of the pilot, the ship struck a reef and an accident immediately occurred. The hull was pierced.

The "Jihe" collided with the reef in the forecastle section. Immediately after the collision, the hull was pierced, and river water rushed into the ship. The captain immediately ordered high tide measures to block the water and telegraphed Shanghai to report to the head office and request immediate dispatch of a rescue ship. Fortunately, the breach was in the forecastle, so there was no immediate major danger, but the passengers on board were greatly alarmed. After reassurance from the crew, they calmed down. When the Shanghai office received the telegram, it immediately negotiated procedures for dispatching a rescue ship and unloading passengers yesterday afternoon.

The ship carried a large number of passengers this time. Since the forecastle had been breached and flooded, it was practically impossible to continue sailing. All cargo and passengers on board urgently needed to be transferred to other ships. After discussion, the company dispatched tugs and barges from Shanghai yesterday afternoon to Tongzhou. The first step was to rescue all passengers from danger, or transport them back to Shanghai to take other ships to Hankou and other ports. The dispatched barges were expected to arrive last night. Salvage the Ship Back to Shanghai.

The cargo loaded on the ship included piece goods, cotton yarn, general merchandise, seafood, sugar, and cigarettes, as well as a batch of salt. Among the goods, sugar and salt could not be soaked in water. Fortunately, the breach was in the forecastle, and the cargo was only slightly damaged. It was decided to first unload the cargo from the forecastle, then use cement to patch the hole, drain the water from the cabin, and tow the ship back to Shanghai for repairs. After completion, it would resume sailing.

### Feixin Dun Visits Acting Mayor Yu to Discuss Tobacco Prohibition and Trans-Boundary Road Construction

Inconsistent Measures Affect the Efficiency of Tobacco Prohibition; Japanese Opinions Often Exceed the Scope

Yesterday morning, Mr. Feixin Dun, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, visited Acting Mayor Yu at the municipal government to discuss the issues of tobacco prohibition in the concessions and trans-boundary road construction. Acting Mayor Yu informed him that since Commissioner-General Jiang for Tobacco Prohibition stipulated a six-year prohibition plan, the central and local governments have made the greatest determination to carry out the work of eliminating the scourge of tobacco. If the measures in the Special District are inconsistent, it will inevitably affect the efficiency of tobacco prohibition. Recently, the central government has successively dispatched special commissioners for tobacco prohibition and deputy directors of the tobacco prohibition inspection office to Shanghai to jointly handle matters related to tobacco prohibition in the concessions. All concerns in the Special District should be considered to ensure smooth progress. Subsequently, both parties discussed the measures separately to present them for research at the next meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Mr. Feixin Dun also inquired about the Municipal Government's consideration of the opinions recently raised by the Japanese Consul-General regarding the trans-boundary road construction case. Acting Mayor Yu immediately replied that the resolution of the trans-boundary road construction issue should be based on the trans-boundary road construction itself. The opinions raised by the Japanese side often exceed the scope of trans-boundary road construction, which concerns China's sovereignty and is difficult to accept. If the Japanese side can change its attitude, the Municipal Government hopes to resume negotiations as soon as possible, he said.

### Cotton Yarn Exchange Market Fluctuates; Trading Suspended Again in the Afternoon

Dagong She reported that after Vice Minister Cheng of the Ministry of Industry advised and Mr. Du Yuesheng vigorously mediated the price surge in the cotton yarn exchange market, trading resumed yesterday morning. Prices for both near-term and far-term branded yarn and branded flower all fell uniformly. Bulls also tried to sell as much as possible to maintain the market. Commissioners from the Censorate, together with representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Industry, went to the market to thoroughly investigate the accounts of brokers. When trading opened at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the market price was pressed down by another seven or eight yuan, and the market fluctuated again, making it impossible to trade. The details are as follows:

Vigorous Mediation, Both Sides Concede

After Vice Minister Cheng advised both the bulls and bears to try to reconcile within the shortest possible time, Mr. Du Yuesheng also vigorously mediated. Both buyers and sellers expressed concessions. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Chen Yu, Counselor of the Ministry of Industry, Yong Jiayuan, Commissioner of the Censorate, Du Yuesheng, Mu Ouchu, Chairman of the Cotton Yarn Exchange, Wen Lanting, Director, Zou Wenmei, Chairman of the Broker Association, Zhou Shaokang, and others exchanged views in the director's office beforehand and then convened a meeting of brokers to report on the progress. At that time, it was decided to open trading based on the red card price of June 11th (Friday), with near-term prices falling by three yuan and far-term prices falling by four yuan as the standard. The bulls tried to sell as much as possible to allow the bears to close out their positions. Both sides fully understood and accepted this method.

Resumption of Trading Yesterday Morning

At 10:30 AM, the bell rang for the market to open. Director Wen Lanting also personally monitored the market. According to the results of the first round of trading, (branded yarn) June contract was 288 yuan (down two yuan from the red card price on Friday, June 11th), July contract was 281 yuan (down 2.5 yuan), August contract was 279 yuan (down 1.5 yuan), September contract was 278.1 yuan (down 0.9 yuan), (branded flower) June contract was 47.2 yuan (down 1.6 yuan), July contract was 47.4 yuan (down 2.1 yuan), August contract was 48.5 yuan (no stock for September), October contract was 47.05 yuan. By the time trading closed in the fourth round of branded yarn, the June and September contracts had fallen by 3.3 yuan, and the July and August contracts had fallen by about 4 yuan. The market atmosphere was quite stable in the morning, so the bulls sold about 23,000 bales to maintain the amount.

Depressing the Market, Forced Suspension of Trading

After 2:00 PM, trading resumed as usual. In the first round, both buyers and sellers reached out to bid, but the bears further depressed the red card price of the morning's closing by two to three yuan. The bulls were unwilling to sell and also abused the market price. The two sides confronted each other, and the situation was serious. The market was forced to suspend trading again. Blackboards were hung on both sides, and the market situation returned to a standstill. Therefore, the trading ended in a few minutes.

Agreed Strict Enforcement of Disposal

After the suspension of trading in the afternoon, the competent authorities and mediators discussed the method to maintain the market trading of the previous month. It was decided to closely monitor the disrupting situation of both buyers and sellers in the market. Once found, the broker, whether buyer or seller, would be immediately disqualified and stopped from trading in the market. Therefore, the exchange authorities decided to resume trading as usual this morning to maintain the market price.

### Old Cashier Bravely Fights Off Robbers, Protecting Over Ten Thousand Gold

Four Robbers Stop Car, Robbers Desperately Struggle; Police Chief Check Post, Robbers Fire Guns, Not Escape

Zhu Fulai, 37, from Luodian, works as an old cashier at Chunmao Huixun Qianzhuang, No. 4 Deming Lane, Dou City Street, outside the Dadongmen Gate in Nanshi. At 8:40 AM yesterday, he was ordered by the manager of the Zhuang, Gong Yingkui, to deliver 18,500 yuan to the head office of the Bank of China on Hankou Road. He packed the banknotes with hemp thread. 10,000 yuan was hidden in his shirt pocket, and the remaining amount was stored in a hand-held rattan basket. He hired a rickshaw. As he was traveling near the busy intersection of Guanqiao Laobai Du Street, four robbers suddenly came forward, two wearing black long gowns and two wearing blue cloth short clothes, and stopped the rickshaw. One robber wearing a black long gown showed a pistol, threatening them to remain silent. Three robbers intercepted the rattan basket, but the old cashier Zhu Fulai firmly held on and struggled desperately. Seeing this, the robber with the gun became anxious and fired a shot to intimidate them, but fortunately, no one was injured. At that critical moment, Lin Shaoxian, the police chief of the Shiliupu branch, was passing by checking the post. He noticed many people surrounding the rickshaw and went forward to inquire. The robber with the gun fired again, but fortunately, the bullet jammed in the chamber, which was also a close call. Seeing that the situation had been exposed, the robbers fled in different directions into the crowd without a trace. The original amount of money was not touched at all. Police Chief Lin escorted the old cashier to the police station and sent additional police officers to hire a car to escort him to the Bank of China. The special amount was delivered as planned. Meanwhile, police detectives were dispatched to the scene of the incident and the Qianzhuang to conduct a detailed investigation and track down the bandit gang to bring them to justice.

### Villagers in Qianjiatang Dig Up Ancient Coins

Shaped Like Ancient Currency; From All Dynasties

About two miles south of Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai, Qian Quansheng, a villager in Qianjiatang, discovered a stone slab after digging a ditch several feet deep in the field a few days ago. When he opened it, it turned out to be a hoard, filled with ancient coins. He took them all out, totaling more than a hundred pounds. Their shapes are like the patterns printed on nickel coins (like trousers), and some are like small knives, all made of purple copper and covered with copper patina. According to the age, they are from all dynasties, including Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming. The person who hoarded them must have been from the Ming Dynasty, who loved ancient coins and painstakingly searched for them and hid them there. The place must have been a large mansion of an official's family, which was reduced to farmland due to vicissitudes. Ancient artifacts from hundreds of years ago were unearthed in one day. Qian Quansheng, a rural farmer, did not know their value, only that they were more than a hundred pounds of old copper. So, he carried them home, which was known to a group of unscrupulous merchants. They flocked to buy them, deceiving Qian Quansheng, claiming that they were scrap copper and that a certain country was collecting copper, so they were willing to buy them for 300 yuan. Qian was overjoyed. Just as the transaction was about to be completed, it was known to local gentry. They said that the objects were related to the national essence and had archaeological value, so they went to report it. The police station in charge sent police to rush to the scene and took Qian Quansheng and the ancient coins to the station together. They have been submitted to the General Bureau for disposal.

### An International Women and Children Rescue Organization to be Established

The Shanghai Times reports that an international organization will be established in Shanghai to enable closer cooperation between government authorities of various countries and voluntary organizations dedicated to preventing the trafficking of women and children, to rescue women and children. This is the result of long-term, dedicated efforts by many residents of this city to establish an agency to curb organized crime in this city and throughout the Far East. It is said that the organization will be named the "China International Women and Children Rescue Federation" and will hold its inaugural meeting this Thursday afternoon. The League of Nations has repeatedly issued reports calling attention to the many women and children in Shanghai and other parts of the Far East who are being trafficked. Recently, a conference on the prohibition of slavery was held in Java. It is believed that the establishment of a powerful and responsible organization in Shanghai is motivated by the Java conference. It is said that Chinese and foreigners will participate in this work. The funding will come from membership fees, donations from various parties, and government subsidies. It is the general consensus that the work of this organization should not be limited to the white slavery issue but should cooperate with various organizations directly concerned with improving the situation of women and children. It is the general consensus that Shanghai is the most suitable location for the headquarters of this organization, as many secret criminal gangs originate in Shanghai and spread to various places. Those who abduct or use other methods to lure women into prostitution are commonly seen in Shanghai. Furthermore, there is a steady stream of Russian women from the north who are abducted and brought to Shanghai. Therefore, it is appropriate to establish a traveler's aid station here to assist women arriving at the North Railway Station and by ships to Shanghai.

### Small American Cars to Operate Today

Fare is 30 cents per mile

After the French Municipal Council approved the operation of small cars in the French Concession, it aroused opposition from major car companies. However, the attitude of the Public Concession authorities towards the operation of small cars in the Concession has not yet been clearly expressed. According to informed sources, these small cars will operate in the French Concession starting today. A total of five cars will be used, and passengers can hail them on the street. The fare is 30 cents for the first mile, and 10 cents for each additional mile. It is said that in the near future, the number of small taxis will increase to fifty, and there is hope that they will be allowed to enter the Public Concession.

### Four Overseas Chinese from the Netherlands Suffer from Epilepsy and Return Home

Already sent to Shanghai Mental Hospital for treatment

Deng Xixiong from Guangdong, Chen Nan from Fujian, Yang Lintian, and Wu Xi, all four were engaged in seafaring and went abroad to the Netherlands last year to earn a living. However, due to unfamiliarity with the place and people, they were unable to find work for a long time, and their funds ran out. Overwhelmed with grief and indignation, they suffered from mental disorders and eventually went insane. Their companions reported this to the consulate in the Netherlands, which approved their repatriation and telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for assistance. Subsequently, the National Health Administration of Nanjing sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government requesting proper arrangements to be made for them. The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and the relief section of the Municipal Police Department immediately dispatched Deputy Officer Wang Guan and others to send the four overseas Chinese to the Shanghai Mental Hospital affiliated with the Chinese Mental Hospital for treatment. If any relatives wish to take them back, they should first go to the hospital on the west side of Avenue Road and Carter Road to identify them.

### Film Association Asks for the Abolition of the Shanghai Concession Film Censorship Office

Recently, the film "New Land" was shown at the Donghe Theater on Zhaopu Road in Shanghai. The content included scenes of the puppet Manchukuo and various humiliating scenes of China. The Shanghai film and drama circles have issued a declaration demanding that the government abolish the right of the concession to censor films and dramas. The Chinese Educational Film Association believes that such illegal behavior insults our country and despises our sovereignty and has petitioned the central government to seriously negotiate the abolition of the Shanghai Concession Film Censorship Office and has also sent letters to the Central Film Censorship Committee for assistance. The original petition is excerpted as follows: "According to the Shanghai Shenbao of June 10, more than 300 people in the Shanghai film and drama circles, including Bu Wancang, jointly signed a declaration protesting the release of the Japanese-German co-production film "New Land" in China. At the same time, the Second Executive Committee of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union also resolved to petition for negotiations to stop it. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council illegally established a film censorship office, it has imposed all kinds of obstacles on domestic films. The past disputes are too numerous to mention. However, it arbitrarily indulges films that insult our country's national identity and allows them to be screened. This time, the concession authorities allowed the screening of the film 'New Land', openly promoting acts of aggression, insulting our country, and despising our sovereignty. This is due to the existence of this deformed film censorship system. If our government continues to indulge it, it is tantamount to accepting humiliation. The Sixth Annual Meeting of this association once passed a resolution to 'petition the central government to negotiate and immediately abolish the film censorship system established by the concessions in Shanghai'. The case has been recorded and submitted for your consideration. Now, the Film Censorship Office of the Municipal Council disregards our country's sovereignty and allows the public screening of the film 'New Land', which is one of the absolute reasons for abolishing the film censorship office. For the sake of the nation and the people, this association dares not remain silent and specially submits this news item again, requesting your council to send a letter to the Executive Yuan ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately negotiate seriously and immediately abolish the film censorship system and give deep consideration to the declarations and demands of the Shanghai film and drama circles to comfort the people's aspirations."

### International Music Examination; Buildings Dilapidated; Fei Man'er Selected

Only 17 years old, studies violin; First Chinese to pass

The Trinity College of Music in London sends professors to various parts of the world every year to select musical talents. The application fee is four gold pounds, about 72 yuan in national currency. The examination was held in Shanghai on the 8th of last month, judged by Professor Albert and Miss Tostoski. Ms. Fei Man'er, a talented student from Hangzhou Art College, passed the advanced violin examination and obtained a violin teacher's certificate. She is the first Chinese to obtain this qualification, which is a glory for Chinese music. Ms. Fei was born in 1920 and is only 17 years old this year. She previously studied piano for three years and then studied violin for four years under the guidance of Professor Botoska. She has achieved this success, which is truly a sign of genius. If Ms. Fei passes the examination once again next year and enters the Trinity College of Music Research Institute, she can obtain an annual pension of 300 gold pounds from the college, which is equivalent to 5,000 yuan in national currency.

### Stage Shut Down Due to Years of Disrepair

Police Station Suspends Business License; Theater Forced to Close

The Xiang Stage Theater at 100 Tianshi Road, Zhabei, was opened by Wang Shubao from Yancheng. The building is simple, dilapidated, old, and dilapidated. The house has tilted. The theater does not comply with the Municipal Police Bureau's regulations on seating (900 seats) and ticket sales, without any restrictions. The number of spectators upstairs and downstairs for both day and night performances often exceeds two or three times. The police bureau has repeatedly warned it, but Wang ignored it. A few days ago, the police bureau sent personnel to investigate and found that the theater did have the above-mentioned situation. After the Engineering Bureau was notified to conduct a detailed investigation and careful consideration, it was believed that the theater was dilapidated, old, and tilted, and the floor was shaking, which could cause public danger. (According to reports, several years ago, during the Dragon Boat Festival, a fire truck drove past the gate, shaking the floor and causing the tragic death of more than 20 male and female spectators.) The police bureau was notified to order the Linping Road Police Station to ban the theater. It is learned that the theater's performance license has been suspended by the police station and submitted to the general bureau. At the same time, the theater has been closed. However, a wooden sign saying "Temporarily Closed for Repairs" is hung high on the iron fence at the gate. It is said that local shops, due to business relations, have heard that there will be some expressions of concern about the theater's closure within a few days.

### More Than Twenty Robbers Arrested in the Public Concession for Several Days; A Large Number of Firearms Seized

Arrested in Three Places Successively; The Police are Conducting a Detailed Investigation

The Public Concession Police Department's General Patrol Room and the Old Gate Patrol Room have arrested a total of 20 robbers from the 12th of this month to the day before yesterday, and seized a large number of firearms. The details are recorded below:

(1) Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspection Office learned that a large number of serious robbers were carrying sharp weapons and plotting wrongdoing, so he ordered his subordinates to conduct strict surveillance of their actions and residences. After obtaining accurate reports, he led Inspectors Liu Shaokui, Wang Chengying, Song Bingzheng, Zhu Shouling, Feng Zhiming, Detectives Yang Xiguang, Zhou Honglin, Xie Futang, and Western Inspector Jialehua, etc., fully armed, in batches to 84 North Xizang Road and other places between 9:00 am and 12:00 pm the day before yesterday, and arrested the robbers Wang A'er, Guo Xiaosanzi, Ji Changsheng, Ding Jutang, Wang Jieqi, Yang Dianhua, Li Guisheng, Li Xilin, Xu Zhimin, Wang Zhixiang, women Yang Shengshi, Ding Gaoshi, and Chen Ruzhen, etc., a total of 13 people, and seized 3 pistols, 21 bullets, and 1 fake pistol. It was found that Wang and others had committed many crimes in the concession, so they were all detained.

(2) On the night of the eve of the Dragon Boat Festival (i.e., the 12th), at 9:15 pm, four robbers, two of them carrying pistols, broke into the Dahua Watch Store at 547 Guangdong Road, threatened and shouted, and robbed 86 watches worth more than 800 yuan. As they were about to escape, Chief Inspector Wang Chengying, Detective Wang Jinsheng, and Qian Xianting of the General Inspection Office were patrolling in the area. Hearing the alarm, they rushed to the scene. Detective Qian grabbed Zhou Longtian, one of the robbers holding a pistol, and Inspector Wang and others stepped forward to take the gun, which contained 5 bullets. They were taken back to the patrol room. Chief Inspector Lu Liankui learned that the place they had agreed to divide the spoils was 208 Luxuezhai Road, Bailinan Road, so he sent additional detectives to arrest Hu Yizhong from Zhenjiang, Hu Chongxin, Chen Zhengguo, and Chen Xiaokuanzi, a total of 4 people, and seized 31 original stolen watches, which were all detained.

(3) Chief Detective You A'gen and Detective Yang Dechun of the Old Gate Patrol Room learned that a criminal was hiding in Room 14 of the Southeast Hotel at 24 Baker Road. At 2:30 pm on the 12th, he led detectives Zhu Shangwu and Chen Shanji to arrest Han Decai from Yangzhou and seized a lotus-shaped pistol and 5 bullets. Later, his accomplice, Tong Laoer, was arrested at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road. It was found that they had committed many robberies recently.

All three cases were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Feng Shide questioned the police lawyer Ru Bao'yi and explained the case, stating that since the accomplices in each case still need to be arrested, the stolen goods need to be recovered, the firearms need to be seized, and the case needs to be investigated, he requested that they all be postponed. After questioning by Judge Feng, all were ordered to be detained and rescheduled for further questioning.

### Xue Xiangyun Case; Chauffeur Appeals

States Reasons for Disagreeing with the Original Judgment; Trial Concluded After Debate Yesterday, Awaiting Judgment

Xue Xiangyun, the daughter of the late paint tycoon Xue Baorun, has lived with real estate businessman Xu Genchen at No. 2, Lane 106, Maithes Road in West Shanghai for ten years since marrying him. Now, Wang Yongquan from Suzhou has filed a lawsuit against Xu and Xue in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court, claiming that his son, Wang Genbao, was born from an affair between Xu and Xue while he was working as a chauffeur for the Xue family. Therefore, he requests that Genbao be recognized as Xue's illegitimate son. The case has been decided in Wang Yongquan's loss. Xu and Xue also filed a case of fraud and defamation against Wang Yongquan and his son in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. After several trials, Wang Yongquan was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for attempted fraud and ordered to be detained in court. Wang Genbao was found not guilty. This has been reported in this newspaper. Now, Wang Yongquan disagrees with the judgment and has hired lawyer Chen Wen to file an appeal to the Second Branch Court of the High Court. His grounds for appeal are described in detail, divided into five points. The first, second, and third points are all based on facts and laws regarding the part of the sentence for attempted fraud, stating the reasons for disagreement. The fourth point refers to the fact that the appraisal in the first instance was not convincing, saying that when Judge Zhong was questioning the case, he initially ordered the appellant Xu Xue to go to the Shanghai Local Court's female forensic doctor's office for examination the next day, but the appellant refused to comply and voluntarily went to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination. Later, Judge Zhong suddenly changed his previous attitude and approved her request. Although the appellant submitted a statement stating that he refused to do so according to law, he ignored it, which was unacceptable. The fifth point is that after Judge Zhong took leave due to illness, Judge Pan Zhenyang continued the trial. He did not renew the trial according to law, nor did he inquire in detail, but began the debate and pronounced the judgment in court with a few words. After the judgment was pronounced, he ordered the detention, which was obviously biased. Based on the above reasons, he should request that the original judgment be revoked and the appellant be acquitted. Also, the appellant has been detained for nearly three months and requests to be released on bail as soon as possible to respect humanity. Yesterday afternoon, President Yu, accompanied by Judges Xiao and Zhou, sat in the Criminal Division 1 of the High Court for questioning. The appellee was not present and hired lawyers E Sen and Tang Shenpei to appear in court. The appellant Wang Yongquan was brought from prison and stated the reasons for disagreeing with the first-instance judgment. Without debate by the lawyers of both parties, the court ordered the conclusion of the debate on the case and scheduled a date for pronouncement of the judgment.

### Overseas Chinese Returning from Spain Fall into Poverty in Shanghai

Request for Relief

Since the outbreak of the civil war in Spain, in order to control food, the government has repatriated overseas Chinese merchants and residents of various countries. There have been several batches of Chinese who have been repatriated. However, these overseas Chinese were all engaged in small businesses in Spain and had no savings. Moreover, affected by the war, the businesses they operated were almost completely bankrupt. Therefore, most of them had nothing left when they arrived in Shanghai. Furthermore, because they had been away from their homeland for a long time, their knowledge of their hometown was also blurred. Although the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau has tried to send some back to their hometowns, there are still not a few who have fallen into poverty in Shanghai. Yesterday, four Spanish overseas Chinese, Wang Jisheng, Wang Baosheng, Wu Changming, and Lu Yutian, etc., because they had been stranded in Shanghai for more than a month, the money they brought had been used up, and they had exhausted their clothes and belongings. They have nothing to live on and are about to become beggars. They specially appealed to various institutions and groups for assistance and asked the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to provide relief.

### New Clubhouse of the Lawyers Association Won by Xi Zhiji to Build

Will not be completed until the end of this year

The Shanghai Lawyers Association's new clubhouse construction was originally won by the Enterprise Construction Company to build. Due to the sudden death of the manager Chen, the construction was suspended midway. After repeated discussions by the Construction Committee on remedial measures, it was decided to invite bids from other merchants. Now, Xi Zhiji has won the bid. All contract procedures have been completed, and construction has been restarted. It will probably not be completed until the end of this year. Also, the Executive Supervisory Committee of the association has scheduled a meeting at the clubhouse on Wednesday evening to discuss important motions regarding the movement for compensation for unjust cases and to send representatives to Beijing to petition, and to review the qualifications of new members. Yesterday, notices have been distributed to all members, asking them to attend the meeting on time.

### Two Drug Dealers Arrested at the Entrance of Sanle Lane

The area of ‚Äã‚Äãlane in the north Sichuan road, Hongkou has always been the territory for the Japanese and Korean that sell heroin, these people do not have fixed places. If they encounter police, they will quietly go away, and after they police went, they continue sell drugs as usual. The drug addicts tend to go to those places. The police are already arresting, but because they have special relationship, our anti drug work is not effective. The drug use atmosphere is still spreading. Yesterday at 10 am, two Korean wearing western suits, held yellow paper bags, and selling small packages of heroin to two Chinese at Sanle alley, Yinxing Road police station, the patrolling officers saw this and immediately went to arrest the two Chinese, and the Korean took the chance to ran away.

The police admits that they taking drugs. Police took this case to Shanghai police station and transferred to Songhu military command for punishment.

### Modification of Chinese Medicine Examination and Certificate Issuance

However, they must be examined in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Chinese Medicine Examination Regulations.

### Lawyer Huang Menggang, Young Owner of Gongdelin, Sued for Divorce by Wife

Disputes Arise Within Two Months of Marriage; Judge Advises Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation

Zhao Guoguang, the 24-year-old young owner of the Gongdelin vegetable restaurant on Pike Road from Huangyan, Zhejiang, works as an accountant in the restaurant. On February 14 of this year, he married Ge Juqing (23 years old) from Ningbo through matchmakers. Within two months of the marriage, the couple began to dislike each other. On April 14, Zhao beat and injured Ge because she refused to take medicine to regulate her menstruation. After reporting to the New Gate Patrol Room, Zhao was prosecuted and fined 30 yuan. Now, Ge has filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court for divorce, payment of alimony, and return of separate property, because Zhao Guoguang often abuses her and she cannot live with him anymore. Her reasons are roughly as follows: On the second day of the plaintiff's marriage to the defendant, the defendant abused the plaintiff on the pretext that the seal on the marriage certificate was upside down. At that time, the plaintiff did not argue with him because she was newly married, but the defendant thought he could be deceived and knew that the plaintiff's brother was far away in Sichuan and had no relatives in Shanghai. He not only did not allow her to step out of the house, but also often humiliated her. On April 11, the defendant Zhao Guoguang and his mother falsely accused the plaintiff of being unchaste before marriage and beat and scolded her. The next day, he beat the plaintiff again. At 3:00 am, she escaped through the window and reported to the patrol room, which has a record. In this situation, it is impossible to live with him again, so she requests that the divorce be granted and that he be ordered to pay alimony of 9,040 yuan (calculated at 20 yuan per month from May of this year until she reaches 60 years old) and return her separate property of 1,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Luo Can opened the Civil Court to summon the defendant Zhao Guoguang, who also appeared in court with his defense lawyer Zhu Cheng. In addition to submitting a defense denying that he severely beat the plaintiff, he said that the plaintiff's injury was because the defendant advised her to take medicine, but the plaintiff threw the medicine bowl and rolled around on the ground, causing the injury. There is a witness, Pang Delong, who can prove it. Finally, he pointed out that the plaintiff had repeatedly filed lawsuits within two months of the marriage, which was a planned act, so he requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected and filed a counterclaim, citing legal principles, etc., requesting that they be ordered to live together. In court, after first questioning Zhao Gejuqing about the facts of the lawsuit and the request, Zhao Guoguang claimed that the plaintiff's claims were not his original intention. He did not abuse her or falsely accuse her of being unchaste. Moreover, when he took the plaintiff to travel around, he repeatedly sought medical treatment for her menstrual problems, so the treatment could not be said to be bad. Therefore, he requested that the monument be persuaded to return home and live together. The plaintiff's lawyer made a statement about Zhao's claim that he sought medical treatment for her, saying that the defendant and others sought medical treatment for the plaintiff on the grounds that she had amenorrhea and told the doctor that the plaintiff was four months pregnant, asking him to be careful. The purpose was to hope that the doctor would write in the plan that the plaintiff was four months pregnant, so that he could falsely accuse the plaintiff of being unchaste before marriage. Since the plaintiff and defendant had only been married for two months, how could she be four months pregnant? In name, the defendant treated the plaintiff with consideration, but in fact, his conspiracy was very deep. Later, after the lawyers of both parties debated with each other, Judge Luo, with the approval of the court, ordered a postponement of the trial and instructed both parties to go out and try to reconcile.

### Lawyer Huang Menggang Restores Membership

Originally Sentenced to Six Months' Imprisonment; Huang Appealed and Was Declared Not Guilty

Lawyer Huang Menggang from Qidong, Jiangsu, joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association in January 1932 and established his office at No. 1, Taihe Lane, Liyuan Road, Nanshi, to practice law in Shanghai. In April of this year, he was accused of embezzlement and prosecuted by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate. He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The Local Court Procuratorate, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Justice, ordered the Shanghai Lawyers Association to remove Huang from membership. However, Huang disagreed with the judgment and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. After trial, the result was that the original judgment was revoked and Huang Menggang was declared not guilty. After receiving the judgment, Huang has already submitted the original judgment to the Shanghai Lawyers Association and forwarded it to all levels of courts to restore his membership and continue to practice law in Shanghai.

### Gang Members Assault Group Members for Failing to Release Gambling Offenders

Fellow Gang Members Argue with Group Members; Words Become Heated, Suddenly Assault and Injure

The Haiguang patrol ship of the Zhejiang Offshore Water Police Team has recently been undergoing repairs at the Hengchangxiang Iron Factory on the Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong. At 9:00 pm the night before last, several sailors and gunners went ashore together to eat snacks at the fried noodle shop opened by a Ningbo woman, Zhang Zhu, at No. 115 Chunjiang Road. On a whim, they suddenly started playing cards, and dozens of gamblers gathered one after another, shouting loudly, and the situation was extremely lively. The First Team Headquarters of the Yangjing District Security Group received a report and Captain Zhang Haigen immediately sent six group members to the shop to arrest them. The gamblers fled by jumping out of the windows, and the team arrested five people, including Shandong native Qu Shaojing, Ningbo natives Wang Baohua, Qu Jinshan, Cai Axi, and Ying Arong, all of whom were from the Haiguang ship, along with the shop owner Zhang Zhu and the gambling equipment and money, and took them to the team for interrogation. Before long, more than ten gang members from the same ship rushed to the gate of the team, demanding the release of the arrested people. Their words were heated, and they argued with Huang Baolin, a local group member. Unexpectedly, seeing that their purpose was not achieved, they became angry and suddenly assaulted and injured the group member. The other members of the team came out to arrest them, but they all fled in different directions. The injured group member was taken to the Pudong Hospital for treatment, and a medical certificate was issued. At 4:00 am yesterday, the defendants and the injured were transferred to the Pudong Branch Bureau. After the bureau officer clarified the case, the plaintiffs and defendants were transferred to the court for questioning yesterday afternoon.

### Two Women Using Young Boy to Pass Counterfeit Coins

At 9:50 PM the previous night, two middle-aged women and a young boy were at a fruit stand on Yaojia Stone Bridge, Datong Road, Zhabei, attempting to buy loquats with counterfeit coins. The fruit vendor noticed and reported it to Officer Dong Yaoxiang of Post No. 13, who went to arrest them. One woman, seeing the situation was not good, immediately fled. The woman Yun Zhangshi, age 30, from Huzhou, was arrested on the spot. She stated that she lived in Dapu Bridge. The boy, Yun Xinfang, age 11, is Zhangshi's son. Fourteen counterfeit copper auxiliary coins (nickel coins) worth two jiao each and ten coins worth one jiao each were confiscated. They were taken to the Xinzha Police Station, where officers learned the details of the situation and obtained information about the woman who fled, Zhang Ajin, who lives at No. 16, Lane 556, North Shanxi Road, Public Concession. Detectives Wu Songshan of the 6th Squad of the Detective Brigade and Xie Zhixian, a detective from the Haining Road Police Station, were immediately dispatched to arrest her. She had already escaped, and the door was locked. Because the case involves disrupting the financial system, it is currently under investigation. (Note: The counterfeit coins are the same size and weight as real coins, but the color is brighter and the sound is like a silver jiao.)

### Dong Miaoying's Lawsuit Against Obscenity; Request to Withdraw the Original Lawsuit Denied

Case to Be Judged and Sentenced

Fu Zhengcai, the owner of the Caojiadu Bathing Pool in West Shanghai, and Dong Miaoying, a No. 1 masseuse at the Huaxing Press House on Guizhou Road, were figures from the Crystal Palace. It was love at first sight. Dong divorced her former husband and brought her son along to marry Fu, forming a Crystal Palace marriage. Initially, they were inseparable and had two children. However, Fu still wanted to continue his relationship with his first wife, inevitably leaving Miaoying with lonely nights and quarrels, leading to estrangement. Dong then sued Fu in the District Court for abandoning her and falsely claiming to be unmarried, thus committing obscenity. He was summoned, but the defendant did not appear. Now that Fu has yielded and made concessions, and conditions have been agreed upon, the plaintiff requested to withdraw the lawsuit yesterday. The court ruled that withdrawal was not allowed according to law and that the case should be judged and sentenced.

### Tailor Strangles Himself with His Own Belt

Zhou Yunzhang, age 46, from Ningbo, was a tailor. Recently unemployed, he changed to running a used goods business. He had been cohabitating for a long time with his concubine, Zou's woman Hu Xiuying (33), in the pavilion room upstairs at the Lianghua Electric Material Store, No. 146, Puen Jishi Road, French Concession. Recently, Zhou, for some unknown reason, suddenly had a change of heart and took his own life. The previous night, while his concubine was asleep, he put his Tianjin belt around his neck and strangled himself. The next morning at 8 AM, the concubine got up and discovered that Zhou was already dead, his body cold. The second landlord reported it to the French Concession Police, who transported the body to the coroner's office. Yesterday, the Second Special District Court, Prosecutor Wang Ren, arrived at the scene and confirmed that Zhou Yunzhang had indeed strangled himself. After questioning his concubine, the body was released to her for burial. However, the concubine was unable to afford it and requested that employees of the coroner's office ask the Siming Public Hall to provide a coffin for burial in the Tongren Fuyuan Tang cemetery.

### Woman Identifies Corpse on Sappo Saire Road Yesterday

Claimed Deceased was a Coppersmith, but Not Yet Confirmed

On the 10th of this month, at 2 AM, an unidentified man, around 40 years old, was lured to No. 442, Cangqiao Lane, Sappo Saire Road, French Concession. He was suddenly stabbed with a sharp blade, receiving eleven cuts to the chest, back, and abdomen, causing immediate death. The murderer fled the scene.

She said that the age, appearance, and clothing were similar to the deceased, who was a coppersmith, and that he was killed because he visited a prostitute. Because a photograph of the deceased had already been taken, it could not be determined whether this was true. Confirmation is still pending. The police are currently dispatching detectives to investigate the murderer.

### Famous Artists Collaborating on Inexpensive Fan Paintings

Zhang Qiuchong, a famous novelist, has been active in the literary world and enjoys a long-standing reputation. In recent years, he has been resting in Shanghai, cherishing his ink and especially skilled in calligraphy. However, he is overshadowed by his literary fame. His running script and regular script are strong and elegant, each extremely exquisite. As the hot summer has arrived, scholars who admire elegance have been visiting to request calligraphy, keeping him busy all day. The literary and art circles, fearing that this would interfere with his livelihood, have encouraged him to set a reasonable price of only two gold coins per fan, as a modest restriction. Zhang Jinglu, the owner of Shanghai Magazine Company, paints pines and flowers, with a pure and extraordinary style, worthy of being called a masterpiece. His price is the same. If Zhang Qiuchong collaborates with Zhang Jinglu on a fan, three yuan will be deducted from each side.

### Drug Case Cracked at Anle Hotel; Interrogations Held Yesterday

Chinese and Russian Suspects Both Deflect Blame; Police Lawyer Requests Adjournment

Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective chief inspector, and detectives Zhou Minglin, Xie Futang, etc., of the General Inspection Office of the General Police Department, learned that Chinese and Russian individuals were secretly dealing drugs and counterfeit money in Room 27 of the Anle Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. They requested a search warrant from the First Special District Court and secretly went to the address at 5 PM on the 12th of this month, arresting Pan Jialu from Anhui. One bottle of heroin and three sample packets were found in the room. Later, Chen Deji from Shandong and a Russian named Mai Diluo arrived and were also arrested. One bottle of the same heroin was found near Chen. They were all taken to the Shanghai Police Department for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted them for the crime of possessing and selling drugs, according to Articles 4 and 16 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Drug Crimes. He stated the circumstances of the case. According to Chen Deji's confession at the police station, the drugs belonged to the Russian, Mai Diluo, and were stored at the home of a Korean named Ji Ming at No. 25, Deshun Lane, Qiujiang Road. He had been asked by Mai Diluo to take a note to obtain the drugs from Ji Ming. It was discovered that Mai Diluo was not only selling drugs but was also collecting counterfeit coins in the French Concession with the intent to sell them. Therefore, he requested an adjournment of the case to investigate the details. The confiscated drugs were presented to the court. Chen Deji testified that he had been a foreman in Pudong for over 20 years and also ran a teahouse. The room at Anle Hotel was rented by him. He had been introduced to Mai Diluo by a friend, Wang Guochang. Last Saturday, Mai told him that he had 30 yuan stored at the home of the Korean, Ji Ming, and asked him to take a note to retrieve it. He knew little about the contents. He went to Ji Ming's place, and Ji Ming handed him a bottle of powder to take back to the Anle Hotel, where he was arrested. Pan Jialu testified that he was in the coal mining business and had gone to the Anle Hotel to discuss coal business with Chen. Chen was out, so he waited in the room and was arrested, knowing nothing about the drugs. Mai Diluo claimed that one of the two bottles of medicine confiscated by the police was called "Bu Di Tuo," a chemical powder that he had bought at a pharmacy on Wusong Road for 3.5 jiao. The other bottle was obtained from the Korean based on Chen Deji's note and he was unaware of its contents. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the testimony and ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody for another seven days before further review.

### Municipal Government to Establish Aquarium

To Increase Citizens' Knowledge of Aquatic Products

The Shanghai Municipal Government, considering that freshwater and marine fisheries in China account for a large proportion of the country's output, and that countless people depend on fishing for a living, plans to establish an aquarium in the city center to provide citizens with knowledge of aquatic production and breeding, so as to provide research opportunities and to develop and innovate the fishing industry. The aquarium is a part of the museum's operations and will be overseen by the museum. A site of approximately 14,000 square meters has been designated between Funan Zuo Road and Fuqian Zuo Road in the city center, south of the Qiujiang River and north of Xiangyin Road, as the site of the aquarium. The museum plans to start preparations in July of this year.

Remembering Deng Tingzhen

During the Opium War, everyone knows about Lin Zexu, a man from Fujian, but they forget that there was also Deng Tingzhen, a wise predecessor from Jiangsu. In the past year, each province selected wise predecessors, with Jiangsu choosing forty, and Deng was one of them.

Deng was from Jiangning (now Nanjing), Jiangsu. He was a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examination) in the Jiaqing era and successively held official posts in Guangdong, Guangxi, as well as the Governor-General of Fujian and Zhejiang, and the Governor of Gansu and Shaanxi. When he was the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, it was during the prohibition of opium. He engaged in battle with the British six times, and the British ships were all wounded and retreated. Throughout his term, British ships were not allowed to enter Humen. Later, he and Lin Zexu were both demoted and exiled to Yili.

Deng was skilled in politics, specialized in the study of ancient sounds, and wrote "Poetry Shuangsheng Shengyun Pu" (Poetry Double Sound and Rhyme Score) and "Shuowen Jiezi Shuangsheng Dieyun Pu" (Explanation of Script and Analysis of Characters Double Sound and Repeated Rhyme Score). He also liked to write lyrics and had a ‚ÄúShuangyan Zhai Ci‚Äù published, full of loyalty, sincerity, sorrow, and laments about the chaos of life. (Bai Hong)

### No-Face-Washing Doctrine

‚Äî Yuehu Huayin

Zhao Shangzhi, a famous general of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, is resourceful, brave, and good at fighting, and is highly valued by his superiors. After the fall of the Northeast, Zhao felt grief over the changed color of the mountains and rivers and the severity of the national crisis. In addition to leading his brave soldiers in a desperate fight against the enemy, he also embraced the "No-Face-Washing" doctrine. Since the Northeast Province was captured, he has not washed his face, vowing that he will not wash his face until the lost territory is recovered. He said, "The faces of the Chinese people are completely lost, so what is the point of washing our faces?" How should we strive after hearing these words from General Zhao!

### Wang Jingwei's Speech

‚Äî Jiao Shijie

Mr. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee, is a very skilled speaker. When he speaks, the entire venue is quiet and respectful. Even when talking with him, listening to his high-level arguments, no one ever fails to nod in agreement.

Mr. Wang has a special habit when he speaks, a habit that can be said to be unique to him. Probably Mr. Wang speaks so vividly that not only are the listeners enraptured, but Mr. Wang himself also becomes carried away. When Mr. Wang speaks passionately, he often rubs the thumb of his right hand on the palm of his left hand. The more indignant he is, the more vigorously he rubs. The higher the words he speaks, the more powerful the rubbing. Therefore, after Mr. Wang finishes speaking at a grand meeting, his palm is always rubbed red and feels hot.

This is a special feature of Mr. Wang's speech, and probably something that others cannot match.

Mr. Wang's eloquence, writing talent, and memory are all gifted with special intelligence. After every important speech, many journalists ask Mr. Wang to write a copy of the speech himself. Needless to say, the speech is written extremely fluently, and it is exactly the same as the order of words and sentences in his own speech, and it can be written out in the fastest time.

### Li Hongzhang and the Foot-Care Artisan

‚Äî Zhang Guoquan

Li Hongzhang, a Qing Dynasty duke and minister, held the key to Beiyang for more than ten years. He was highly respected and influential. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, he was criticized by the court and the public, and his prestige was slightly diminished. However, the Qing government still relied heavily on him. After Li resigned as the Governor-General of Zhili, there was no immediate position for him. At that time, the strategy of alliance with Russia was strongly advocated, and the Empress Dowager ordered him to visit various countries as a courtesy visit, in order to get a glimpse of the neighbors' intentions. Li received the order and arrived in Shanghai, waiting for a ship to go abroad. As soon as the traveling mansion was settled, he urgently ordered a search for a foot-care artisan (now known as a foot scraper). Li's left foot had calluses on the sole, like flesh thorns, almost an inch deep. A certain attendant, with unique skills in surgery, used to treat it every evening, otherwise he would be in so much pain that he could not touch the ground. This time, the attendant was unwilling to travel far and deserted his post, and Li could not force him to stay. Later, he learned that a certain artisan in a certain bathhouse was the most skilled with a knife, so he summoned him to the traveling mansion and asked him to try it. Li greatly praised him and immediately ordered him to be rewarded with ten gold coins. He then asked if he would be willing to go abroad with a monthly salary of seventy yuan. The artisan did not dare to agree immediately and went home to discuss it with his relatives and friends, who encouraged him even more. He then replied that he was willing. Li rewarded him with another hundred gold coins, ordering him to buy bedding and take care of his family needs, and arranged for him to go abroad by boat. Unexpectedly, after receiving the gold, the artisan became anxious and sleepless because he was leaving his wife and children and traveling alone, and he became mentally ill. He died in less than ten days. Later, Li hired an American artisan in France at a high price, specializing in "foot" affairs, always by Li's side and never leaving. When Li finished his term and returned to China, the American artisan also came with him.

### Li Dachao's Expelling the Barbarians

‚Äî Zongheng

When Wu Tiecheng was the mayor of Shanghai, there was a resourceful section chief in the municipal government named Li Dachao. He could be regarded as Wu's important assistant, as people who read newspapers probably know. It is said that Li named his study "Rangyi Shi" (Expelling the Barbarians Room). The words "Rangyi" are certainly very fashionable these days, and everyone thought that Li's name must have a meaning of the times, but who knew that Li had another meaning.

It turns out that Li's wife, Ms. Wang, is a former member of the Legislative Yuan. She and Li are very affectionate, and Li respects her as a guest. It is said that every time Ms. Wang returns from a meeting in Nanjing, Li always goes to the station to meet her and then returns home together. This can be said to be unfailing. At the same time, because Li really loves his wife very much, he named his study "Rangyi."

What does this mean? Think about it: above the words "Rangyi," aren't there also the words "Zun Wang" (Respect the King)? What does "Zun Wang" mean? It can also be self-evident. A clever double entendre, this is the mystery that Li deliberately created. From this point, we can also see Li's intelligence.

### Kunshan's National Hero

‚Äî Meiren Xiangcao Zhai

Our country is inherently weak, and foreign insults are frequent. Coastal areas are often invaded, and national heroes are recorded in history. Outside the Chaoyang Gate in the western suburbs of Kunshan, there is a former General Bu Temple of the Tang Dynasty. The buildings are spacious, the spirit is remarkable, and the incense is very prosperous. Behind the hall is a tomb, which is the long-sleeping place of a generation of national hero, General Bu. The tomb is built of Kunshan white stone in a rectangular shape, surrounded by a hexagonal cement tomb path, and planted with pine and cypress trees all around. There is an offering table and stone figures in front of the tomb, which makes people feel solemn and respectful. I was serving in this country. During my spare time, I often went to pay my respects. Thinking of the unfinished national crisis and the great difficulties in the future, I often burst into tears. Now I will introduce the deeds of General Bu on the right:

General's surname is Bu, name is Zhen, and courtesy name is Wenchao, from Xihe, Tang Dynasty. During the reign of Emperor Jingzong, the principles and regulations were weakened, and the separatist warlords were riotous. The general was loyal, and when the Tang Dynasty was about to fall, he launched eastern and western expeditions, and his heroic achievements were great, and he was promoted by the world. On the 15th day of the fourth month of the Binyi year, he suffered a slight illness for sixteen days. He bathed and dressed, and died suddenly, at the age of sixty-nine, and was buried in the western foothills of Kunshan. The general has accumulated spiritual miracles. During the Gengwu and Xinwei years of Zhengde, there was a major epidemic in the city, which foreshadowed the response. In the Jiayin year of Jiajing, the Japanese pirates attacked the city, and the spirit of the god appeared, killing the Japanese pirates in the west of the city, so that the city was complete. The county magistrate Zhu Qianshou played a melody into the sacrifice. In the thirty-third year of Jiajing, in April, the Japanese pirates suddenly arrived, from the Sanjiangkou to Dongguan...Xiguan, the city was about to be broken, and the guards were all crying. An old father stepped forward and said: "Just boil tung oil, mix it with filth, and drop it from the gap in the moon city, and the thieves can be captured." As he said, he got two great leaders, tied them to the flagpole, shot them to death, and the thieves then lifted the siege. Qianshou patrolled the city, rested in the temple of the earth god General Bu, and looked at his statue, that is, the old father of Xiguan, so he presented his case, and sacrificed to him in spring and autumn.

Looking at the above historical sites, during his lifetime, he was loyal to the Tang Dynasty and took it as his responsibility to revive the nation. After his death, he showed his spirit and retreated the enemy, so that the territory would not be lost and the dangerous city would be preserved. He has contributed to our Chinese nation, and his achievements cannot be ignored. On the fifteenth of the month, it is the general's birthday, and there is a custom of holding a temple fair. The grand occasion this year is rare in previous years. On this day, thousands of people left their homes, and the place was crowded with people. People from Suzhou and Shanghai came to watch, which is not uncommon. Although it is close to wasting people and money, it is also an excellent stimulant for the national spirit in this national crisis.

### Record of Meeting General Wu Peifu

‚Äî Jian

On the fourth day of my arrival in the old capital, it was drizzling. I went to Shijin Garden to visit General Wu Peifu. People in the South have very few records of General Wu's life, only knowing that he closes his doors to study the classics and does not concern himself with outside affairs, "The aging hero only plants vegetables." I felt that his sorrowful and lonely state must be something that fragmented texts and words could not fully convey. Upon arrival, his residence was majestic, with several dozen tall trees standing out beyond the neat and solemn water-Á£®Á†ñ walls. Two or three soldiers with rifles stood guard at the door, showing no signs of poverty. After submitting my card for an audience, I first met his adjutant, Mr. Hong, who requested that we not discuss political issues, and hinted that Mr. Wu's words might not fully hit the mark. I, as a reporter, already knew this. In his later years, Hindenburg had lost all his vigor, and when guests discussed world affairs with him, he was incoherent and confused, barely able to form sentences. "Time is cruel." General Wu is old, and his thinking is no longer in line with the standards of this era, which is no secret. However, as a typical old-style military man, he has his proper place in the early history of the Republic of China. In terms of integrity and character, no other military men can compare with him. The reason why I insisted on seeing him was partly due to "historical sentiment."

After several minutes, Mr. Hong and Mr. Zhang Fangcong, Wu's chief of staff, came to greet me, saying that Mr. Wu was already waiting in the hall. Heading north from the reception room, we entered a large courtyard, full of various flowers and trees, with singing birds in the middle, a rather beautiful environment. Mr. Wu was wearing a long cotton silk robe, his face full and radiant, quite unlike the gauntness in his old photographs. He rose from his seat to greet the guest, slowly saying, "Have you been here long?" His accent was soft and gentle, and when he spoke, he slightly revealed his teeth, several of which were white with gold inlays, shining brightly. I briefly explained my purpose, and Mr. Wu held my name card, read it, and said with a smile, "Your name is Hui Jian (ÊÖßÂäç, Sword of Wisdom), very good, you can take on national affairs. These two words come from the Vimalakirti Sutra, using the sword of wisdom to break the thieves of vexation. Today's various vexations need this sword to resolve." I knew that his words were profound and extensive, so I took the opportunity to ask what state the turbulent situation in the North would develop into. Mr. Wu pondered for a moment and asked me in return, "I am currently writing a book, have you seen it?" I replied in the negative, so he called his attendant to bring it as a gift, which turned out to be a volume of "A Shallow Explanation of the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Zuo Zhuan." Mr. Wu pointed to the book and said, "You can read it carefully." I glanced through it briefly, and the book was only one volume, covering the fourth and fifth years of Duke Yin. I was quite surprised that Mr. Wu's book only published this one part. Perhaps it was because it contained sections such as Zhou Xu assassinating the ruler and the Wei army entering Cheng, which could be used for his repeated deductions and expressions of accumulated feelings. Mr. Wu is not particularly scholarly, and there are many far-fetched interpretations in his notes on the Zuo Zhuan. However, it is not impossible to say that they are reflections on current affairs. Such books should be read with a different perspective, what is called a tearful smile, not to be erased with a single stroke. I then asked about the memorial service for Kang Youwei, which had been held in Zhongshan Park. General Wu had a deep friendship with Kang Youwei, but what about his relationship with Zhang Taiyan? Mr. Wu replied, "Also a good friend. Kang Youwei and Zhang Taiyan have similar personalities, but their achievements differ due to age and the times. Kang Youwei was older and came out earlier, becoming the leader of the Protect the Emperor Party. Zhang Taiyan was younger and had overflowing talent, which could not be accommodated in the space below Kang Youwei, so he wasÊøÄ and entered the revolution. If the two were to switch places, Kang Youwei could be Zhang Taiyan, and Zhang Taiyan could also be Kang Youwei." At this point, Mr. Wu sighed, believing that "After the passing of the two, there are no more literary figures in the country. Although the two have many disciples, none are capable of carrying on their legacy." I wanted to test his views on the New Literature, so I said to him, "Zhang Taiyan has a disciple named Zhou Shuren, pen name Lu Xun, whose literature is excellent. Have you ever read his books?" Mr. Wu seemed quite dazed, as if he did not know the name. I asked for a pen and wrote the two characters Lu Xun to show him, and Mr. Wu was even more confused. He then excused himself, saying, "I do not read books from the Republic of China era, so I do not know this person." I baited him with words, saying, "General, have you forgotten the May Fourth Movement? These were all warriors of that time. I still remember people saying that you, General, had great sympathy for the youth movement. What about today? Do you also have the intention and feelings to approach the youth in the North?" Mr. Wu nodded repeatedly. A certain Mr. Wu's staff, sitting beside him, interjected, saying, "The General is still very concerned about the student movement in Beiping, but he is powerless to do anything." We sighed together. Mr. Wang Jianrong, who came with me, took out a camera and took a picture of Mr. Wu, who seemed quite pleased. From photography, he expanded to discuss the common origin of the three religions, mostly citing theories in the style of the Wushan Society. Mr. Wu's view of life and the universe is greatly at odds with the current era. I do not want to write down his words, and even if I did, they would not form a coherent system.

Finally, Mr. Wu suddenly spoke to me about Nanjing, saying that when his warships passed by in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the lights of Xiaguan were as if before his eyes, but he did not enter the city. After Feng Huanzhang returned his troops, Mr. Wu hurriedly came south by sea, the Zhili faction's general trend was over, and this was a major turning point in Mr. Wu's personal history. After this came a life of misery and embarrassment as a fugitive, so Mr. Wu's memories of this time were extremely deep. Mr. Wu criticized the terrain of Nanjing, saying that it was not suitable for establishing a capital, saying, "I have Xiakou, and I cannot defend it, let alone Nanjing. Qi FuwanÁïô me to live together in Nanjing, I firmly declined it, precisely because I saw this." Mr. Wu also cited Zhang Taiyan's eulogy for the martyrs of the Republic of China as proof, saying, "This place of crouching dragons and crouching tigers is an ancient person's false statement." Knowing that his prejudice was very deep, I then asked if he had any new poems. He said, "I have not engaged inÂêüÂíè for a long time. Recently, I have been writing a shallow explanation of the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Zuo Zhuan behind closed doors, completing several pages a day, hoping to complete it in forty years." He laughed loudly as he spoke, the laughter very loud, as if it contained endless vitality.

After I bid farewell, I further inquired about his private life from Mr. Hong and Mr. Zhao, who said that he did not see many guests and only wrote books. After meditating in the morning, he would definitely eat tangerines. He also organized the Mingjing Study Association with Jiang Chaozong and others, serving as the president himself, with Jiang as the vice president, the two getting along quite well. Xu Lanzhou, his former mentor from the Northeast, would occasionally visit to talk. When asked if Yang Yunshi often came, he was nominally still Wu's secretary, but he did not come often.

Leaving the door, I hailed the rickshaw driver who had brought me, a thin-faced man with a beard, still waiting by the roadside. Seeing me, he smiled and said, "Is Wu Erye in good spirits?" seeming very concerned about his health. The big-headed and clumsy people of Peking University, the typical figure in their ideals, is still "Wu Peifu style." The peddlers and couriers of the old capital are all respectful when they hear Wu's name. This is Wu's comfort in his twilight years, and it is also why his late integrity can flourish.

Talks

### On Suicide

‚Äî Shen Qing

Suicide seems to have become a fad recently. Opening the newspaper, one can find a few such reports almost every day. Not to mention being forced to this point (as the saying goes: "Better to live badly than to die well." If not forced to the extreme, who would be willing to end their life?), or dying in an inappropriate way, regardless of whether the reason for death is economic or otherwise; suicide becoming a trend is a loss for the individual family, the country, and society as a whole, a major hidden worry!

Suicide is the act of the weak, we have heard this too much: let's not worry about these for now. Not counting those without suicide notes, those who leave suicide notes before their death generally have a common point: hoping that relatives and friends or compatriots can strive to be promising, do something for the country or their parents, and hold their heads high. But what about themselves? They end it with death. Upon closer examination, this is somewhat laughable: it also confirms the cowardice of the deceased: or, to put it bluntly, it is an evasion of responsibility. Of course, what the deceased sees may be pitch black, and there is no way to "strive," but they also know that changing the pitch black into light is necessarily requires "striving," so they entrust "striving" to others, as if other people's environments are different from theirs, and that to "strive," one must have a good environment.

To tell a joke, this is somewhat like saying that to swim, one must wear a good swimsuit and go to the swimming pool to swim, and once one falls into the sea, one can only let the "environment" swallow them because the environment is dark. Naturally, this analogy is a bit too much. Death is a very serious matter, and the pain of those who have experienced it is so deep. We have no time for mourning and pity, how can we gloat and "eat the dead man's tofu"?

However, sympathizing with the deceased is not as good as using more effort to save the living!

We also know that the words "striving" are very abstract. Shouting "striving" all day long is not necessarily striving. And a dark environment is always a fact. Seeking a ray of light in the darkness, bumping and colliding until one's head is broken and bleeding, is also common. It is of course of no help to oneself to willingly fall down in a dark alley, and it only adds obstacles for those who come later, leaving a bad impression and making them tremble with fear and not dare to move forward. Even shouting "striving" when falling down, hoping that those who come later can step over their corpses, what benefit does this weak cry have in reality? The sound disappears, and what is seen is terrifying white bones and corpses.

Naturally, we will not forget, and we will definitely not let go of who created this dark alley? How and with what was the dark alley created? Not only do we ask for a few bright lights in the dark alley so that people can walk, but more importantly, how to find a way to blast open this pitch-black environment, so that those who come later will never be unable to find a light, feel depressed, feel darkness, and commit suicide.

To do such difficult work, biting our teeth and living on is the first priority. One person's strength may not be enough, but gathering the strength of many people will do. Moreover, even in a dark alley, many people holding hands and moving forward is always more convenient than one person groping. And now there are many people in the same pitch-black environment.

### Dawn

‚Äî Fang Hei

No money, no joy either. I fell onto the flower-patterned bedding, tossing and turning all night with my head covered. The "Ka" brand clock on the bedside still ticked relentlessly. Although it was late at night, it still accompanied me, tirelessly ticking. Like a friend talking there. I felt a kind of joy, and then my thoughts drifted off.

The night dreams of children are beautiful, woven on rainbows and sunsets. At the start of the mundane world, there is vaguely heaven. The shadows of traveling together. I only remember that in my dream, I once reached out and shook down the stars in the sky, and barbs once grew on my back for no reason.

I also had such dreams, but that was far back in my childhood. Now, how can I not yearn to sleep at the bottom of my dreams, but I have not been able to fall asleep for many years, let alone have refreshing dreams.

Last night, the same loneliness accompanied me as I coughed under the lamp. For more than ten years, I have buried my nose deep in the same books, but I am forever trapped in this empty night. I expect a ray of dawn to fall in front of my bed, and to shine on my face.

Outside the rustling window, willow leaves were swaying the embroidered edges of their skirts, echoing with the seemingly meaningless sighs of a young girl. There was a solemn moon, but no sky, and even the sound of the wind was dark.

I found a cigarette and smoked it, the smoke rings were gray.

I pinned my hopes on those few faint stars. Through the heavy curtains, I stared at them.

The dwarf trees in the garden may be bending their waists and shaking their heads, seeming unable to bear the loneliness. But these were all indifferent to me. I only silently faced the faint stars and thought of the approaching dawn.

The night was heavy, hesitatingly sinking from the western horizon. The sticky mist of the night spread languidly, accumulating in the distant west.

And on the eastern corner of the sky, the hazy treetops, the faint light of dawn was peeking at the eaves and chimneys of the thatched hut.

In the depressed shade of the house, there was a low and faint chirping of insects. The wind was blowing, the air was fresh and smooth, surrounded by a gentle atmosphere. There was no mechanical noise, and no time of money and power.

Gradually, breaking through the dark atmosphere, dawn floated out from the distant past.

I climbed down from the warm bed. The great sun on the eastern horizon rolled out half of its red arc, swirling like a vortex, as if in the chaotic universe, the ancient earth was scattering blazing sparks.

I threw open my arms to the eastern sun, then clasped my hands together.

But our children are not even skilled at seeing the morning sun!

### Suspicious Case

‚Äî Xin Ye

The early summer night was quiet, and the Haihe River in Tianjin was also quiet.

On the opposite bank of the Haihe River, a row of modern buildings cast their shadows, the XXXXX Yarn Factory and XXXXX Foreign Company's warehouses. On the rooftops, the flagpole heads vaguely had tattered flags fluttering in the starry sky. On the shallowÊª© of the riverbank, there was nothing empty. The surroundings were quiet, with only the sound of flowing water hissing softly.

On the corner of the Dragon King Temple on the left, a dim street lamp hid in the middle of a utility pole. It was as if it were a neurasthenic, opening itsÂ§± eyes and shining on the muddyÊª©, making the surrounding environment even more somber and desolate.

Next to the riverbank was a wooden archway-style sign, with the words "Lifesaving Association Salvaging Floating Corpses" written on it. Behind it was a wooden house that was not very tall, with a ray of light shining outward.

"Damn it, those floating corpses are being salvaged constantly, I wonder where they come from?" Old Zhang stood by the board door, smoking an inferior cigarette, speaking in a way that was both a sigh and a question, to Little Wang sitting under the lamp.

"Who knows, the authorities have offered such a large reward but still can't solve the case!" Little Wang shifted his gaze from the firelight and looked at Old Zhang as he answered.

"The weather is getting hotter and hotter every day. If we keep salvaging like this, it will really be unbearable."

"Really, Old Zhang, if you and I solve that case, wouldn't we get a big reward? Old Zhang, if you and I had five thousand dollars, would we still come to do this unpromising work of salvaging dead people?"

"Hey! Solve the case, is that so easy! I'm afraid I won't solve the case in my lifetime."

"Who says? Will such a big reward be posted without the case being solved? If ordinary people solve the case, they get a reward of five thousand dollars, and if civil servants solve the case, they get promoted three ranks. This is what Chairman Song said, this amount is not a joke, everyone wants..."

"But, it's been more than a month, and after catching the corpse-dumping workers Kong Zhaoyuan and Yang Xiang last month, there hasn't been a single clue until now."

"Who cares, who doesn't know the secrets of what the XXXXX people are doing, but even though the authorities know, there's nothing they can do. Solving the case and getting the reward, will that ever be our turn..."

As the two talked, they gradually fell asleep.

The early summer night was quiet, and the lower reaches of the Haihe River were also quiet. Only the Ê≤ôÊ≤ô sound of the wind blowing the locust tree leaves and the hissing sound of the flowing water in the Haihe River echoed each other.

Suddenly, a beam of white light shot out from the diagonal corner of the Dragon King Temple, shining on the wooden sign, shining on the wooden house where the corpse-salvaging workers lived. Then, two policemen in uniforms, carrying flashlights, walked up along the riverbank, shining their lights here and there, trembling with fear as if something was about to happen here.

"There's nothing here, let's go over there and take a look, maybe we'll run into someone dumping a corpse." A younger policeman shone the flashlight towards the Dragon King Temple and said, wanting to walk over there.

"Don't!" The middle-aged policeman grabbed his shoulder and said, "The Dragon King Temple is in the XXXXX concession."

"Weren't those floating corpses flowing down from the concession?"

"No! Last year they flowed down from upstream, and about five hundred were salvaged ashore, not counting those that were allowed to float away. And this year, more than a hundred have been discovered in more than a month, which do not seem to be deaths from illness or suicide, nor do they seem to be drug offenders, so once it was published in the newspapers, the matter attracted everyone's attention. So the XXXXX people changed their location and started collecting dead bodies on those more deserted riverÊª©."

"It's all the tricks of those hateful XXXXX devils, aren't those dead men taken in by them!" The young policeman couldn't help but feel a little angry when he said this.

"The most hateful are a bunch of heartless traitors who only know how to be used by the XXXXX people,Ë¥™ l·ª£i themselves, and go to the interior to recruit Chinese laborers for them. The families of those floating corpses are still dreaming of them sending money back, don't you think it's tragic? Little Jin."

The two slowly walked to the Dragon King Temple. The door of the Dragon King Temple was tightlyÊâ£ÁùÄ. They sat down by the door. The young policeman pointed to the wooden house.

"The people here haven't slept yet, their fire is still burning!"

"They salvage floating corpses during the day, they're probably sleeping now!" He had just finished speaking when suddenly they heard a "plop" in the river, so the two torches simultaneously shone on the river surface, and they followed suit and stood up and walked towards the riverÁÅò.

### Rear-Engine Bus Appears

‚Äî Ying Dai

Many people say that tomorrow's car engine will be placed in the rear of the vehicle. From the perspective of the automotive industry in Detroit, the automobile city in the United States, they also believe that at least one or two car factories will adopt automatic transmission in the 1938 model of new cars, seemingly standard or optional equipment, especially by moving the engine to the rear. However, according to the news from the Society of Automotive Engineers, according to Mr. Austin Wolf, a member of the Society, in the past few months, one hundred automatic transmission rear-engine buses have been running in the streets of Chicago. This transmission style is called Mono-Drive, including a parade-style transmission mechanism. The front has a three-part speed, and the back has one part, with automatic control and automatic clutch. There are two internal shoes that expand by centrifugal force. This force is generated by two weights under the jurisdiction of the weights and their connection method and two pressure springs. The clutch drum is in contact with the clutch shoe, which is part of the transmission assembly. It is connected with two kinds of weights. After a first elbow joint, to an equalizer. From that connecting rod, it extends to the second elbow joint mechanism, which is where the clutch shoe expands. This clutch starts working, allowing the engine to turn 400 times per minute, and the maximum height reaches 800 times per minute. At that speed, the clutch is in full working order. Any increased pressure on the clutch shoe, pressed on the clutch drum, is the result of centrifugal force working on the shoe itself.

In order to accelerate from 400 revolutions per minute to 800 revolutions per minute, a long sliding time is required in the middle. However, excessive sliding can be avoided due to the rapid downward movement of the accelerator. The work of the clutch is alwaysÂº•ÁïôÁùÄ, until it reaches less than 400 revolutions per minute. When it is less than 400 revolutions per minute, the clutch stops working. Under normal driving conditions, driving and shifting are automatic due to the action of the accelerator pedal. Usually, when the driver starts, using second gear can make the vehicle travel eight miles per hour, and increase to fourteen miles per hour. There is no limit to when to shift gears. This engine can quickly increase to 2,200 revolutions per minute under any starting conditions. When this bus is traveling at less than ten miles per hour, the transmission will automatically return to second gear, and when traveling at less than five miles per hour, it will shift to first gear. According to Mr. Wolf, the transmission mechanism and clutch assembly on this bus is 100 pounds lighter and five inches shorter than usual. Chicago's buses travel 2,000,000 miles each, with approximately 20,000,000 passenger miles.

### Increased Production and Sales of Wills Cars

‚Äî Fu

According to reliable information, the production of Wills cars is increasing monthly, and April was a record-breaking month. The production reached 9,819 vehicles. According to Mr. Wilson, the general manager of the Wills Company, as of May 1 this year, the total production of the 1937 Wills model was 38,421 vehicles. Among them, the March production was the highest record since the manufacture of the new Wills last autumn. But now the April production has increased by 4.5% compared with March. According to the company's sales department report, all products are shipped out immediately after being manufactured every day, but there are still many orders in backlog, and it is quite difficult to meet the demand. Wills' sales matters are handled by 2,300 managers and merchants. This time, in order to promote national sales, Wills has launched a seven-week feat of traveling one million miles. Merchants enthusiastically participated and provided 2,000 Wills DeLuxe sedans, equipped with light yellow bodies and green bumpers, for application. This feat began on April 19 and will end on June 7. Since its launch, the results have been excellent. The retail sales of Wills cars have increased sharply throughout the United States.

### The American Automobile Business at the End of Spring (Continued)

‚Äî Yu

The popular sales of the "Cadillac LaSalle" were similar to what was mentioned above. The number of cars shipped this year has already exceeded the total number of last year, and the number of orders on hand has reached 26,000. Although Cadillac stopped production for a month during the strike wave, they hope that 1937 will be the most promising year. The large cars produced by Packard are very popular, so their sales are also very impressive. Mr. Huang Leishuo, the Deputy Manager of Chrysler Sales, said that car users in New York and other cities have recently liked to buy our high-priced cars, and the sales volume is unprecedented. The price of high-end cars has been reduced a lot compared to the previous two or three years, which must be said to be one of the reasons for its popularity. Now, you can buy a better car for US$2,000. In the past, this kind of car had to be bought for at least US$3,000. Since the curtain of the depression has been removed, many people want to choose a means of transportation among high-priced cars again.

Judging from the number of retail passenger car registrations since January 1, the territory of independent automakers has gradually become consolidated. According to Mr. Balies, the Deputy Manager of Nash Factory, the 1937 Nash cars that have been manufactured are much more than the 1936 Nash models. Studebaker is also moving forward. In February 1937, a total of 7,971 cars were sold, which is a significant increase compared to the 6,196 cars in the same period last year. By March, the number of cars sold by the factory had increased by 3,472 compared to the same period in 1936.

In March, the Packard factory in Detroit ran at full capacity and worked hard to build cars in order to meet the needs of retail sales. Their large cars also occupy a very advantageous position in the market, so March and April can be considered as periods of large-scale production for Packard. The Terraplane and Hudson cars sold by Hudson have made progress compared to 1936. Therefore, once the labor unrest is resolved, business will greatly improve. The sales of Graham's current model cars have increased by 35%. The new car of Wallace Waflan, No. 20,000, was produced in Duerto on March 2. Since November 30 last year, Wallace has twice fulfilled their plan.

The recent business of independent automakers has made great progress. Even in the past year, the turnover of independent merchants at the end of 1936 was greater than that in 1935. According to insiders, this year's business will be even more advanced. The production volume of commercial vehicles and freight vehicles manufactured by independent manufacturers is even more numerous than that of passenger cars.

The output of Buick cars has also increased significantly. Now, just talking about 1936, since the 1927 model car was launched in September of that year, the production volume in the last quarter of 1936 was 72,016 vehicles, compared with 50,329 vehicles in the same period in 1935, an increase of 43%. The peak month in 1935 was November, when 14,287 vehicles were delivered to retail buyers. The record high for new car production in December 1936 was 23,000 vehicles. At that time, the week with the largest production volume was the last week of December. The two factories in Flint and Los Angeles can produce an average of 1,350 new cars per day. In the last four months of 1935, the production volume of new Buicks was 60,903 vehicles, while only 46,703 vehicles were produced in the previous eight months. In 1936, the wages paid to workers by the Buick factory also amounted to US$25,000,000, an increase of US$4,000,000 compared to 1935. The average number of employees in 1936 was 13,500 per day, while the average number in 1935 was 11,000 per day.

### The Substitute for Gasoline Today by Fang Jiahua

‚Äî Fang Jiahua

Gasoline today is like human blood. If the world were without gasoline for a day, neither airplanes nor armored vehicles, etc., could make their power felt. Even all industries would inevitably come to a standstill. Some say that if a country lacks a little gasoline, it is like a human being lacking a little blood. This statement is not an exaggeration.

Among the countries in the world today, only the United States has a large production of gasoline. Only Russia is self-sufficient. The rest of the countries are in a state of great panic. Especially countries such as Italy, Germany, and Japan. In peacetime, they still have to rely on imports from abroad. Not to mention the large amount of gasoline after the outbreak of war. Once it is exhausted. Therefore, countries that lack gasoline are all worried about it.

Recently, I heard that countries such as Germany, Japan, Italy, and Russia are studying the manufacture of substitutes for light gas, first applying a pressure of 1,000 pounds to the light gas, and then heating it to a high heat of 1,000 degrees, so that the light gas becomes a water-like liquefied light. Use this as a substitute for gasoline. It has considerable effectiveness. I am afraid that it will be easy to implement in the future.

In recent years, the roads in our country have reached the path of development. The need for gasoline is increasing day by day. I heard earlier that someone had a report on extracting gasoline from coal. But no large-scale implementation has been seen. I hope that our country's scientists will research it.

### "Teng Action" Can Avoid Trembling

The picture on the left shows the "Winning Action" test to reduce bumps when driving. An electric light is installed on the top of the car. A light is also installed on the front wheel hub. Then take a picture of it in the dark. The line on the top is straight. The next line is wavy. How do you know that the "Teng Action" avoids trembling when moving forward? The car in the picture is a "Chevrolet".
