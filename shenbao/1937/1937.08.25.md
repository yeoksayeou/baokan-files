### Enemy's Rear Assault Plan Fails, Fierce and Bloody Battle Rages All Day in Lion Grove

Battles Still Unstoppable as of 5 AM This Morning. Enemies Who Slipped into Luodian Have Been Completely Annihilated. Enemy Troops in Zhanghuabang and Other Areas Have Been Completely Swept Away.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) In the past two days, the center of the war has shifted to the Wusong coast. Two divisions of enemy reinforcements, having spied for many days, took the opportunity to sneak across and attack our army's rear. Fortunately, our army was well prepared. For days, enemy troops landing at Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, Wusong Paotaiwan (Fort Taiwan), Lion Grove, and other coastal areas have been bravely repelled head-on by our army. Scattered remnants of the enemy are now concentrated in Lion Grove, putting up a desperate resistance. Another group of approximately one thousand men infiltrated Luodian Township by a roundabout route. After being heavily surrounded by our army and engaged in fierce fighting for half a day, they were completely annihilated. On the Lion Grove front, the most intense bloody battle began yesterday afternoon. Both sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat, with enemy corpses scattered across the field. As of 5 AM this morning, the fighting had not stopped. According to a certain military expert, based on a comparison of the military strength of both sides and the geographical situation, the complete elimination of the enemy at Lion Grove is only a matter of time. It will not cause any military hindrance to our side and is therefore not a cause for concern.

From the 22nd to the morning of the 23rd, enemy troops launched sneak attacks on Wusong, Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, Liuhe, Yanglinkou and other places, attempting to land. Our army bravely countered, and the fighting was exceptionally fierce. The enemy was ultimately unable to withstand the attacks and retreated in a disarray. However, the enemy's attempt to land was not extinguished. The enemy dispatched a brigade the night before last (23rd), under the heavy cover of dense enemy ships and artillery fire, fiercely attacking the Wusong Paotaiwan (Fort Taiwan) area. A small number of enemy troops also managed to sneak across and land. Our army calmly responded with dense machine-gun fire and heavy artillery counterattacks. Soon, our air force arrived to assist in the battle, launching fierce bombings. The enemy troops, caught in a pincer attack by our land and air forces, suffered heavy casualties. After a bloody battle until approximately 3 AM yesterday morning, our army finally inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy, completely thwarting their attempt to land.

Further news: Yesterday (24th) morning, at approximately 4 AM, as dawn was breaking, another approximately 3,000 enemy troops approached the border, swarming ashore in the area from east of Paotaiwan (Fort Taiwan) Foreign Wharf along the embankment to Shigeng. This area, a wide sandy beach, a former seawater bathing area, was easily accessible. At the time, our army remained completely still, waiting until all the enemy troops had landed before launching an ambush and encirclement. They used machine guns to bravely sweep the area, taking a three-pronged attack, engaging in fierce fighting for over three hours. The enemy troops suffered heavy casualties, with most either killed or wounded, and began to retreat in disarray towards the beach, hastily jumping onto motorboats and fleeing towards Sanxia Water. Our army seized a significant amount of enemy equipment. There are still many enemy ships on the sea off Lion Grove and Bailongjiang River facing Wusong, constantly attempting to land. Therefore, our army has deployed heavy troops to guard each of these locations. Yesterday, in addition to firing to cover the landing of troops, there was little other artillery combat time from enemy ships. The sound of artillery fire was sparse in the afternoon because the enemy troops were intimidated and did not dare to launch sneak attacks during the day. Furthermore, our coastal positions are solid, making it difficult for enemy ships to succeed.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Yesterday afternoon, a certain shipping company in this port received a telegram from a foreign ship blocked in Litongsha, stating that the intensity of the Wusong battle yesterday, the fierceness of the artillery fire, and the bravery of the Chinese army in repelling the enemy were indescribable. At the height of the battle at noon, a squadron of Chinese air force flew to the Wusong sea area, risking danger to drop bombs and bombarding a Japanese transport ship fully loaded with reinforcements. This led to an air battle, with machine-gun bullets flying wildly in the air and occasionally landing near the ship. The sound of gunfire at Wusongkou subsided slightly at 4 PM. The Jardine Matheson's Shinfuku Maru was the first to venture in, finally arriving at the Kin Lee Yuen Wharf at night. Ningxing and New Beijing have not been able to come in yet, and have to come to Shanghai at 8 o'clock this morning, because the Public Concession and the Japanese Naval Commander stationed in Shanghai have agreed that all refugee ships flying foreign flags can pass through Wusong at 8 am and 3 pm every day. If there is fierce battle (such as yesterday), even if there are regulations, they cannot enter or leave.

Enemy Landing Troops Suffer Heavy Blows

Reliable news: The day before yesterday (23rd) morning, at approximately 4 AM, the enemy, with a brigade of troops under the intense artillery cover of a large number of warships, once again attacked us along the coast of the Baoshan Chuansha River Estuary. Our defending troops fought valiantly to defend their positions, holding on for dear life until approximately 6 AM. Eventually, a portion of the enemy troops took the opportunity to land, launching fierce attacks on our positions. Enemy traces were found along the coast from the Lion Grove Fort to the Chuansha River Estuary. While the enemy engaged us in intense fighting, they sent a small detachment of approximately six or seven hundred men, sneaking from Chuansha Township through Mujiao Bridge to Luodian Township. Our Luodian defending troops, upon receiving the urgent report from the front lines, had already arrived at the line between Shengjiaju and Yuepu Township. Our main force, which was controlling the ×× area, had not yet arrived at Luodian Township. There were only a very small number of garrison troops stationed there, and they were unable to resist effectively. The enemy troops then occupied the township and constructed fortifications nearby to prevent our reinforcements from advancing. At approximately 2 PM, our reinforcements arrived at the front lines along the Jialuo Road and the Huta Road, immediately surrounding and fiercely attacking the enemy at Luodian. At this time, the enemy's heavy weapons had not yet been fully deployed. After our army launched a fierce attack, the enemy struggled for approximately an hour before collapsing completely. They set fire to houses, covering their retreat, and immediately retreated along the original route. Our army tracked and pursued them to the vicinity of Chuansha Township. The enemy resisted by relying on the river. Both sides engaged in fierce fighting across the river. Our army encircled the enemy from the right flank, causing the entire line to collapse. At approximately 4 PM, our army annihilated all of the enemy troops, capturing a large number of enemy maps and weapons. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, with bodies littering the area. After our army cleared the enemy from this line, they immediately moved eastward along the river, advancing to the front of Shengjia Bridge. Our army was still engaged in fierce fighting with the landing enemy. We used an overwhelming force to launch a fierce attack on the enemy's flank, causing them to collapse in disarray. As of yesterday (24th) at 3 PM, our army was still encircling and annihilating the enemy at the old site of the Lion Grove Fort.

### Enemy Troops Who Slipped into Luodian Completely Annihilated by Us

Over Two Hundred People All Eliminated. Enemy Planes Fly to Drop Bombs, Causing Fire.

Central News Agency: The day before yesterday (23rd) at noon, a large number of enemy troops suddenly appeared in Shidong, near the Lion Grove in Baoshan County, and with the cover of heavy artillery and aircraft, sneakily landed. Our army immediately fought valiantly to meet them, but because the enemy's artillery fire was dense, more than two hundred enemy troops broke through and slipped into Luodian Town near Shidong. Soon after, our rear troops reinforced the troops from □□□□, and attacked the enemy troops who entered Luodian. By 1:00 a.m. yesterday (24th), the enemy who had entered Luodian had been completely annihilated, and our army immediately advanced to Shidong, and eliminated the enemies there.

Central News Agency: Luodian Town, Baoshan County, used to be a very prosperous commercial center and the best in the entire county. But the day before yesterday (23rd) at about 7:00 a.m., six enemy aircraft flew to drop sulfur bombs, and a big fire broke out in the town. After all the firefighters were dispatched to rescue, the enemy planes used machine guns to arbitrarily strafe our firefighters, and seven people were injured or killed on the spot, causing the fire to spread and all the bustling areas of the town were turned to ashes. Yesterday morning at about 10:00 a.m., several enemy planes flew to drop bombs, but none of them hit, so there was not much loss. The Shanghai Fellow Association of the county is now actively trying to rescue the refugees of the county from danger. There were also enemy planes flying to bomb the inside and outside of the Jiading County the day before yesterday, with as many as sixty bombs dropped, but fortunately our side was prepared, so there was no loss.

Enemy Troops at Zhanghuabang Completely Repulsed

According to official news, at about 12:00 noon on the 23rd, six to seven hundred enemy troops sneaked across and landed at Zhanghuabang, but were bravely repulsed by our army with dense machine guns and fierce artillery fire. Another group of approximately one brigade of enemy troops sneakily landed between Baoshan and Chuanshakou (ie Shidong), and have been surrounded by our army, and the battle is very fierce. At that time, a small number of enemies reached Luodian at about 2:00 p.m. on the 23rd, and they were also surrounded by our army and completely annihilated, and many maps and weapons were seized.

Enemy Aircraft Carrier Arrives at Chuansha

According to reliable news, an enemy aircraft carrier arrived at the sea off Xujia Town, north of Chuansha County, with the purpose of protecting the enemy troops at any time and sneaking across the coast to land, but our army's defenses are so solid that the enemy will never succeed.

Our Army's Central Route Thrusts Westward

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After the enemy reinforcements sneaked ashore the night before last, the center of the war in this port has shifted from Hongkou to Wusong. Therefore, the Hongkou front was quieter yesterday morning. There was no fierce contact on the line of Yuanfang Road and Zhaoshu Road. In the north, there was sporadic artillery fire in the Qujiang Road area. On the left and right sides of Hushan Road and Huade Road, there were still stalemated street battles. Since arriving in the Hushan Wharf area, our army's central route has been bravely thrusting westward for days. One part has arrived at Wuzhou Road, and has now advanced to North New Hongqiao, connecting with our army in the Disiwei Road area. Another part has arrived at East and West Huade Road, and has also advanced to the Hongqiao River. The enemy troops retreated to the Bailao Road area west of the Outer Hongqiao, making a final struggle.

The hundred or so remnant enemies who occupied the Gongdong Iron Factory were completely annihilated by our army the day before yesterday. Currently, Baoding Road, Huade Road, Jingzhou Road, and Tangshan Road are all in the hands of our army, and there are no traces of the enemy. The enemy troops set fire to the houses from Tangshan Road to Kunming Road when they retreated, and almost all of them were turned to ashes.

The official news about the battle in the eastern district of Hongkou last night is as follows: ㊀ The enemy troops set fire to the houses from Tangshan Road to Kunming Road when they retreated, and almost all of them were turned to ashes; ㊁ Tangshan Road area is now entirely in the hands of our army; ㊂ The hundred or so remnant enemies in the Japanese Gokin Iron Factory were completely annihilated by our army in the past two days. Currently, there are no traces of the enemy in the Baoding Road, Huade Road, and Jingzhou Road areas. ㊃ The wharves along the Yangshupu and the along-river areas, which are still in the hands of the enemy, have been severely damaged by our artillery fire. The remnant enemies suffered heavy losses and did not dare to enter the wharves. They are now stepping up the construction of new fortifications near the wharves, hoping to defend them to the death, but their morale is extremely panicked. Regarding the Hongkou area, the remnant enemies trapped in Hongkou Park, because they have fallen into a heavy encirclement and are facing a desperate situation, have launched three consecutive attacks on our lines since the evening of the 23rd, hoping to break through, but were all repulsed by our army. The enemy suffered approximately two hundred casualties.

Our Air Force Launches Three Night Raids

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At 9:20 last night, our air force suddenly appeared in the moonlight, in the dim of night, over the enemy ships in the Huangpu River and the enemy positions in the Hongkou area. The enemy was caught off guard and panicked, and the meteor-style red and green illumination bombs and anti-aircraft guns were fired in a continuous stream, glittering with multicolored lights, creating a spectacular sight. But our air force did not care, and the sound of the planes became closer and closer. After about a quarter of an hour, the enemy's anti-aircraft guns became more and more dense, and at the same time, our planes responded with extremely fierce machine-gun fire. Suddenly, there was a thunderous sound, shaking far and wide, as our planes dropped huge bombs.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At 0:15 this morning, several of our air force planes launched a second night raid on the enemy ships in the Huangpu River. The enemy ships fired their anti-aircraft guns in unison, and our planes dropped five bombs in a row. One of the bombs made an unusually loud and crisp sound, presumably hitting an enemy ship. Our planes bombed for about half an hour before leisurely flying towards the Songkou area. Just as the enemy's terrified souls had settled down, hoping that our planes would not fly again before dawn today, unexpectedly, within half an hour, our air force launched a third surprise attack. At that time, the situation of the enemy's anti-aircraft guns firing wildly and aimlessly showed the enemy's panic and chaos. But this time, our planes only circled for about ten minutes and did not drop bombs, and still went to the northeast. In summary, our air force's three night raids are estimated to have cost the enemy at least a thousand anti-aircraft shells.

Central News Agency: After our planes flew to Songkou last night for a night raid on the enemy ships, they flew from Song to Shanghai at midnight. Amidst the dense firing of enemy ships, the planes calmly dropped many bombs, and then safely left Shanghai and returned.

Our Planes Shoot Down Two Enemy Planes

It is now known that at 9:00 a.m. the day before, when enemy planes attempted to land in the Wusong area and were severely attacked by our army, 27 of our planes flew to assist in the battle. In addition to dropping bombs on the enemy ships and causing them serious damage, they also shot down two enemy planes.

Enemy Planes Reconnoiter Zhabei Yesterday Morning

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At approximately 10 AM yesterday morning, three enemy planes first flew to Zhabei to reconnoiter our army's positions for about a quarter of an hour. Shortly thereafter, five more enemy planes came, flying in a circle at an altitude of 2,000 to 2,500 feet, and then dropped several bombs. Our side suffered no losses. At the same time, our position's anti-aircraft guns fired in unison, and the enemy planes immediately fled into Hongkou. Until approximately 1 PM, several enemy planes came to reconnoiter various parts of Zhabei, and did not stop until evening.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy planes, in view of the fact that our air defenses in the Nanshi area are exceptionally complete, and that they are at risk of being shot down by our army at any time, have reduced the number of enemy planes over Nanshi to a very small number. Even when one or two fly over, they fly at extremely high altitudes, hiding in the clouds and almost invisible to the naked eye.

Enemy Ships Bombard Pudong Again Yesterday

Yesterday morning, the Japanese flagship Izumo, leading many enemy ships, used dense artillery fire to bombard our Pudong area. Our ×× area also returned fire, and the sound of artillery was very loud. The people of the city were all awakened from their sleep, and then stopped slightly. At about 9:00, the sound of artillery fire started again, and stopped after about an hour. At the same time, many enemy planes hovered and reconnoitered over Pudong.

Major Fires in Pudong and Hongkou Yesterday

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At 2:30 a.m. yesterday, the Japanese Nissin Company, the East China Railway Wharf, and the Mitsubishi Corporation, all located on the Pudong side of the river from the 16th Pier to Dongjiadu in Nanshi, suddenly caught fire simultaneously. The flames soared, and the firelight connected, and spread very quickly, resulting in all of them being turned to ashes. Until 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the embers had not been completely extinguished, and the losses were incalculable.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The major fire in various districts of Hongkou has been burning for three days and nights. Although it had been slightly extinguished once, the fire rose again this morning, and the embers reignited. According to reports from all sides, the fire in the middle route is burning in the Chinese-style civilian houses near the Nanyang Tobacco Company. On the eastern side, the east side of the pile of Pinghe Yangxing on Yangshupu Road has also caught fire. The fire on the north side is near the Hongkou Police Station and Jiaxing Road, and the border of the concession, etc.

The enemy troops set fires in the Hongkou area to block our army's advance, and spread to Tangshan Road, Broadway Road, Wusong Road, and Haining Road, etc., turning thousands of civilian houses into scorched earth. Fortunately, our army managed to put out the fire, and most of it was extinguished yesterday morning. However, one place in Shenjiawan is still burning, while Hanbili Road and Yuanfang Road, etc., have been rekindled and are burning fiercely, with the potential to spread further.

### Our Newspaper's Reporter Personally Inspected the Front Line This Morning

Commander Wang Jingjiu Had a Sincere Conversation: The Enemy Troops Can Be Annihilated in the Shortest Possible Time

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At approximately 12:00 last night, the reporter of this newspaper drove to the Wusong front line to inspect. The route was winding and circuitous, and there were repeated inspections. After passing through Zhenru Dachang, the reporter arrived at a certain place at 2:00 a.m. this morning, and interviewed Commander Wang Jingjiu, who was attacking the Huishan Wharf. According to him, the enemy troops who sneaked ashore in the Lion Grove and Chuanshakou areas are estimated to be one division. Due to being bombarded by our army midway, one part of them retreated midway, and the remaining remnants barely struggled. This morning, our army launched a fierce attack, and it is expected that they will be completely annihilated in the shortest possible time. As of 5:00 a.m. this morning, the sound of artillery fire has not stopped. The approximately 2,000 enemy troops who landed in Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang the night before have been completely repulsed by our army. As for the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas, our army is strictly guarding the advantageous positions it has gained and is still waiting for an opportunity to attack the enemy. Wang's spirits were high and his speech was concise and to the point. Before leaving, he also wrote "Resist to the End" for this newspaper as a memento, which will be printed in this newspaper's evening edition today.

### The Bomb Dropped on Nanjing Road Was Indeed a Japanese Airplane Bomb

A "安" (An) Character Was Found on the Fuse of the Bombhead, Which Is the Same As the One on the Pistol Left by the Japanese Officer in Hongqiao

The tragedy of the bomb dropped on the Sincere Company the day before yesterday, which resulted in numerous deaths and injuries, has now been proven by various parties to have been an airplane bomb, not an artillery shell. This is because another bomb fell behind the U.S. Navy depot behind the Sichuan Road and Hamirton Building, but it did not explode. The bomb at Sincere Company and the one at the Navy depot were studied, and the results were similar, but slightly shorter. The diameter of the bottom of the bomb is about 18 inches, and the height is about 4 feet, and the weight is about 1,000 pounds. Therefore, the theory of artillery shells is impossible. At the same time, British and American gun experts conducted a detailed study of the unexploded bomb in the depot, and unanimously agreed that it was undoubtedly an aerial bomb. And there are several characters that look like Chinese characters but are not actually Chinese on the unexploded bomb. There are three yellow lines on the bomb. At the time of the incident, there was no activity of our air force in the concession and Pudong areas, but at that time, it was unanimously witnessed that several Japanese planes were circling in the public concession. As for the unexploded bomb, it is kept by the U.S. Navy.

Important Evidence Found

Central News Agency reported that a bomb fell on the Sincere Company the day before noon, killing more than 170 people. It is now known that the head of the bomb has been found. After inspection, it was found that there was an "安" (An) character on the fuse of the bombhead. When the Hongqiao incident occurred earlier, a pistol left by a Japanese officer was seized, and there was also an "安" (An) character on the fuse of the gun. This is enough to prove that the bomb at the Sincere Company the day before yesterday was indeed dropped by a Japanese plane. Traffic Resumed Yesterday

After the tragedy at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road yesterday, the Public Concession police, British troops, the Volunteer Corps, the fire department, and the Boy Scout ambulance team quickly rescued and cleaned up the scene completely the night before. The road surface has also been repaired, and traffic has been fully restored since 5:00 this morning. Trams and buses have all resumed operation, but because there are still fragments and gravel falling from the destroyed buildings, the sidewalks on both sides of the scene of the accident are blocked off with obstacles to prohibit pedestrian traffic. Sincere and Wing On are completely closed, while the nearby New World and Great World are open as usual. The broken glass windows of Sincere and Wing On have been nailed with wooden boards. It is said that the internal losses of Sincere and Wing On were extremely heavy. The East Asia Restaurant on the third floor was completely destroyed, and the bomb penetrated to the second floor, so the first floor also suffered a lot of damage. The bottom floor was also shaken and destroyed. The losses of Wing On, in addition to the deaths and injuries of customers and employees in the store at the time, were severe from the bottom floor to the fourth floor.

Observations from Westerners

The English-language North China Daily News stated that the huge bomb that hit the building of Sincere Company has been determined to be a bomb, but it has been broken into pieces and is difficult to identify. However, the huge bomb that fell on the U.S. Navy depot at the same time is complete because it did not explode. It is believed to have been dropped by a plane flying at extremely high speed. According to foreign observers, when the tragedy occurred at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, three Japanese planes were seen flying over the Public Concession. A silver single-seat aircraft, which foreign observers called a "strange aircraft," was flying extremely high, and even with powerful telescopes, it was impossible to identify the symbols on the aircraft. The Public Concession is currently being investigated by Inspector Robertson of the Lao Zha Police Station. The British and American naval authorities are also conducting a separate, informal investigation for the Public Concession.

Death and Injury Toll Announced

The Public Concession announced the death and injury toll as follows: From 6:00 p.m. on August 23rd to 10:00 a.m. on August 24th, the latest statistics of the deaths and injuries in the Nanjing Road tragedy are as follows: 173 dead, 549 injured. Sincere, Wing On, and the surrounding buildings suffered heavy losses. The deaths and injuries of foreigners are as follows: Deaths: Mr. Brunner, Swiss, and Mr. Eggerd, German. Injured: Mr. Beringer, American, Ms. Sheamomey, Ms. Grant Chow, and Ms. Denai. The police deaths and injuries were one Indian police officer and two Chinese police officers. Seriously injured: one Indian patrol leader and four Chinese police officers. Slightly injured: one Chinese patrol officer, one Chinese patrol leader, and three Chinese police officers.

### Foreigners Continue to Leave Shanghai

From 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. yesterday, more than 400 foreigners continued to board small fireboats at the Jianghai Customs Wharf in four batches and sailed to Songkou, where they transferred to the German Postal Ship Company's Glouisenan to Hong Kong. Most of them were German nationals. In addition, a fourth group of about 100 American women and children from Shanghai boarded a small Dalat Company wheelhorse at the Customs Wharf at 1:00 p.m. yesterday and went to Songkou, where they transferred to the Pierce President to Manila. In total, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the total number of foreign nationals (excluding Japanese) who have left Shanghai is over 4,000.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Shanghai Neutral Zone Issue

— Supplement

After the Shanghai situation deteriorated, Japanese imperialism immediately used the Public Concession as a military base to attack our city's armed forces. For the sake of defending our territory, our army had no choice but to immediately fight back. At the same time, the neutral status of the Concession had already been undermined by Japan's military actions. Therefore, for strategic reasons, we had to advance and destroy the Japanese military base. The resulting losses will naturally be the full responsibility of Japanese imperialism. This is something that the two countries with vested interests, Britain and the United States, should understand and appreciate. However, Britain has an investment of 250 million pounds in Shanghai. In order to protect this huge interest, it is naturally unwilling to see the continuation of the war in Shanghai. Therefore, it recently suggested to both China and Japan that a neutral zone be established in Shanghai. The content is roughly divided into two points: ㊀ Both Chinese and Japanese troops withdraw from the area around Shanghai. ㊁ Britain, the United States, France, and other countries guarantee the safety of expatriates to Japan and guarantee to China that Japan will not use the Concession as a military base. Since this proposal was put forward, China and Japan have not yet officially replied. According to semi-official sources, Japan has already decided to reject it, while China has stated that it can accept it in principle. How this matter will develop in the future is still unknown.

The proposal for a neutral zone in Shanghai is very necessary from the British point of view in order to protect their huge investment interests. However, from our perspective, we should adhere to two important positions.

First, the outbreak of war in Shanghai was due to the challenge and aggression of Japanese imperialism against our territory. We are simply fighting back in self-defense. Therefore, as long as the Japanese army can withdraw from the Wusongkou and not use the Concession as a military base, the war in Shanghai can be ended. The so-called proposal to establish a neutral zone is not needed at all. At the same time, the Public Concession itself is inherently a neutral area, with sovereignty still belonging to China. As long as the Concession Bureau can effectively maintain this neutral status, the war in Shanghai will not escalate. The countries concerned in the past could not maintain this neutral status and prevent Japan from using the Concession as a military base. Now they are putting the cart before the horse and suggesting the establishment of a neutral zone, including the Shanghai urban area. This is something we cannot but consider carefully.

Secondly, the war in Shanghai is part of our country's comprehensive resistance against Japanese imperialist aggression. We will never have a local truce until Japanese aggression ends. If Shanghai can establish a neutral zone due to the relationship between the Concession and private interests, then Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places can also establish neutral zones in the same way. This will not only hinder the development of our overall resistance situation and damage the integrity of our national territorial sovereignty, but also benefit the enemy's offensive. This is a point we should carefully consider.

In short, we should give goodwill consideration to the neutral zone construction of friendly nations, but we should also closely consider the integrity of our territorial sovereignty and the overall situation of the war of resistance.

(Special dispatch on the 24th)

[Baoding] In order to prevent our attack, the enemy on the Pinghan Railway line has recently set up barbed wire from the east gate and south gate of Liangxiang County to Kaigezhuang, and installed flat-trajectory cannons on the city walls. Enemy tanks frequently travel between Liangxiang and Changxindian, and the situation is extremely panicked. In addition, Kaigezhuang is now stationed with five or six hundred enemy infantry and more than ten cannons, and has built a strong position, firing artillery at our army's position from time to time. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)

[Baoding] Our army on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line has also won successive victories.

In total, from the 21st to the 23rd, our army won victories one after another, and the enemy was repeatedly defeated, suffering heavy casualties. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)

[Tianjin] Since Sunday night, artillery fire has been heard from time to time due to favorable winds, which is very clear. Therefore, people are now speculating about the source of the artillery fire and the location of the battle. The Japanese side insists that this artillery fire is only intended to intimidate plainclothes teams. However, since the sound comes from the southwest, and some Japanese soldiers had moved southwest along the canal two days ago, and the artillery fire has been rumbling almost continuously in the past 24 hours, it is generally expected that the battle is now underway. Observers speculate that the battle may have taken place near Duliu, 15 miles from Tianjin, where the canal connects with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line. However, the details are not yet known.

Two planes flew east via Xiaoshan, and one plane flew to Ningbo via Shaoxing, Yuyao, and Cixi, dropping bombs.

⊙Yinxian: This morning at 7:00 a.m., two enemy planes flew to Yong, dropping two bombs. At 8:15 a.m., they dropped 12 bombs. Because our army fired anti-aircraft guns in unison, the enemy planes fled in panic. (Special dispatch on the 24th)

[Wuhu] An enemy heavy bomber was shot down in Guangde a few days ago and burned in Baishuitang, a suburb. Except for one pilot who died on the spot, the remaining four escaped. According to reliable sources, the four men got lost in a village in Nanxiang, looking extremely distressed. They were escorted to the county government by farmers and immediately sent to the capital for disposition. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)

### Overseas Chinese in the United States Enthusiastically Care for the Motherland

[New York] The propaganda of the overseas Chinese here is quite effective. The laundries set up by the overseas Chinese attach small booklets to the clothes bags and distribute them to customers, urging them to help China resist Japanese aggression. Tens of thousands of people have now received this booklet. This move by the Chinese laundries has raised several tens of thousands of dollars for Nanjing government support.

### U.S. Secretary of State Hull Calls for a Ceasefire Between China and Japan

Settle Disputes Based on International Treaties. The U.S. is willing to put its peace policy into effect.

[Washington] Secretary of Defense Hull today strongly appealed for world peace, primarily directed at China and Japan. Hull also reiterated his statement of July 16 regarding U.S. foreign policy, saying that more than 50 countries have formally recognized this policy as a principle of international relations, and both China and Japan have expressed their approval. In addition, there are various international treaties, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, which contain the same principles. Both China and Japan have signed these treaties. The U.S. government still firmly believes that these principles should be the foundation of international relations and should be universally implemented throughout the world, including the Pacific region. This statement was clearly made in response to Japan's reservations. At the same time, Hull solemnly stated that the U.S. government still intends to work hard to maintain peace in the Far East and protect its expatriates there. To this end, the government has dispatched a small number of Marines to Shanghai. The U.S. military has no intention of aggression, but wants to help maintain local security. Senator Warman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave a radio address tonight, strongly defending President Roosevelt's unwillingness to hastily implement the Neutrality Act. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 23rd)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently issued an appeal to China and Japan, advising each country not to engage in war and asking both parties to resolve their current disputes based on the principles recognized by most countries in adjusting international relations. "Since the outbreak of the conflict between China and Japan, the U.S. government has been constantly urging both parties to seek peaceful solutions. The U.S. government does not trust the two strategies of forming alliances and absolute isolation. On the contrary, the U.S. government believes that only by carrying out peace work can the various goals listed in my written speech of last month be achieved." Hull further explained that the government has now taken various measures to protect U.S. expatriates in China, saying that most countries, especially the United States, have interests and rights in Shanghai, so the situation in Shanghai is particularly "special." "U.S. troops in China have the responsibility to protect expatriates, and their mission is not of an aggressive nature. However, the scope of the current Far East dispute is far beyond the urgent issue of protecting the lives and interests of expatriates. In short, the U.S. government has great faith in its peace policy and is eager to put it into effect. It will do everything possible to ensure that the various basic principles of this policy are complete and undamaged, and that they are universally implemented in the Pacific and around the world." (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)

### Shanghai Troop Withdrawal Proposal

Our country's response to British statement accepts the proposal. Japan is cunning, and the British are disappointed.

[London] China has recently notified Britain that it is prepared to accept in principle the British proposal that Chinese and Japanese troops and warships jointly withdraw from the Shanghai area. Japan's reply has not yet arrived, but the British government is extremely disappointed with Tokyo's passive attitude. Japanese people in London all believe that Japanese reinforcements have arrived in Shanghai, and the date of victory is not far off. Therefore, they believe that if the Chinese army is driven out by the Japanese army, the need for a neutral zone will naturally disappear. Furthermore, although France has agreed to the British proposal, the United States feels that the effectiveness of this proposal depends on whether Japan complies. Judging from the current situation, it is difficult to achieve in reality. Therefore, China's agreement has no practical effect other than shifting the responsibility for rejecting everything onto Japan. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 24th)

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, and several other key cabinet members will hold a meeting in the next few days to discuss the war in Shanghai. According to British diplomatic sources, British policy is limited to protecting the Shanghai Public Concession and British interests in other places threatened by the war. This policy is not likely to change. It is expected that the cabinet members will decide to increase the number of British troops stationed in Shanghai. However, if the Japanese government can propose a compromise plan regarding the British proposal so that Western countries no longer have any concerns about the safety of expatriates and their interests in Shanghai, then Britain may not continue to send troops to Shanghai. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is currently resting at the seaside in Hampshire. He returned to London once in the middle of last week and will do so again this week. The Foreign Secretary will visit the Foreign Office this afternoon and report the current diplomatic situation, especially the situation in the Far East, to the Lord Privy Seal, Lord Halifax, taking advantage of the Prime Minister's temporary return to London on Wednesday, and discuss related matters. The British government has not yet received replies from the Chinese and Japanese governments regarding the Shanghai neutral proposal. Semi-official circles in Tokyo seem unsympathetic to this proposal, so there is considerable disappointment here. Although Nanjing has not officially replied, it is heard that it has a tendency to agree, which pleases the British. The British authorities in Shanghai are currently doing their best to protect British expatriates, but if the war around the Concession continues for a long time, it cannot be guaranteed that there will be no accidental deaths or injuries. Therefore, women and children have been temporarily moved elsewhere to avoid various inconveniences. The British government has issued an official announcement stating that it has decided to take various plans to protect the lives and property of British expatriates in the Public Concession and ensure their safety. According to the Navy Department, British ships in China are currently stationed at the following locations: Shanghai has one cruiser and one escort ship each; Wusong has one destroyer, one flagship, and one escort ship each; Putuo Island has two cruisers and one destroyer; Qingdao has one aircraft carrier and one destroyer each; Weihaiwei has one submarine tender, one mine-laying ship, one destroyer, and one escort ship each; Yantai has one destroyer; Qinhuangdao has one destroyer; Dagu has one escort ship; Nanjing has one cruiser. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 24th)

[London] The Daily Telegraph published an editorial today entitled "Japan's Dangerous Attempt," saying that if the Shanghai Public Concession is kept out of the war zone, the safety of Japanese expatriates can be guaranteed. The mediation by all parties seems to be rejected by Japan, which must be acknowledged. The steady forces in Japan have now been trampled on by the war-mongering military cliques. All those who sympathize with the Japanese Restoration cannot help but regret the decisions of the current Japanese authorities, which harm everything they have gained in the unprecedented progress of the past fifty years. Japan is now participating in battles in two places with a large army, and there is a trend to extend it to other places. Its financial and economic resources are unable to cope. Japan's assets, used for business in China, are already dwindling, and the benefits promised to its people in the new area of activity have not been realized. It may not be too late for Japanese politicians to discuss whether it is worth betting the country's entire economy on the victory of its continued aggression.

### U.S. Ambassador Returns Home; British Attention

Ambassador Gu Visits French Authorities

[London] Diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to the rumor that the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Bingham, is returning to Washington because it is related to Britain's proposal to form a joint U.S.-French front in Shanghai. Although this rumor has not been confirmed as of now, it is quite possible that Britain will make this proposal. However, there is no intention on the part of the U.S. to do so. Although the United States has expressed support for the British proposal to establish a neutral zone in Shanghai, it has stated that this is a purely passive measure, and the U.S. government has not considered any active measures. (National Maritime Telegraph dispatch on the 23rd)

[Washington] Regarding the war between China and Japan, the only issue that the U.S. government is currently paying attention to is the protection of U.S. expatriates in Shanghai and other places in China. President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and the President's key advisers, including senior army and navy generals, did not leave Washington last Saturday and Sunday because they wanted to pay close attention to the development of the situation in the Far East. The seriousness of the situation is evident. Regarding the protection of expatriates, the State Department had already instructed U.S. consuls in various parts of China to strongly advise their nationals to leave the war zone as soon as possible. However, these expatriates, on the one hand, have invested huge sums of money in China and are unwilling to give up, and on the other hand, they believe that they are under the protection of consular jurisdiction and do not worry about anything else. It is not easy to get them to withdraw. In addition, regarding the U.S. implementation of the Neutrality Act, well-informed sources believe that this move would only benefit Japan. President Roosevelt has decided to postpone it as much as possible. However, if Japan launches a large-scale attack on China, President Roosevelt will naturally implement it, which may not be entirely beneficial to Japan, because Japan will then have to buy goods from the United States in cash and use its own ships to transport them, which would be very inconvenient for Japan. The U.S. authorities have considered prohibiting the export of certain raw materials, such as pig iron, copper, and kerosene, to China and Japan, but they believe that if this move were to be implemented, Japan would definitely object immediately. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)

[Paris] The Chinese Ambassador to France, Dr. Gu Weijun, visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. As Foreign Minister Dalbos was on vacation and had not returned, he was received by Secretary Leuret, who discussed the situation in the Far East.

### Incident of the U.S. Flagship Being Bombed

U.S. Commander Reports That the Source of the Bullet is Unknown

[Washington] The Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Yarnell, reported to the Navy Department today that after a detailed investigation of the incident in which the U.S. flagship Augusta was hit by a stray bullet in the Huangpu River, it was impossible to prove the source of the bullet. All seventeen sailors who were injured have gradually recovered and are in no danger. However, both China and Japan have been asked to pay special attention to the direction of artillery fire in the future. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 23rd)

### Germany Worries About the Escalation of the War

Affects Export Trade

[Berlin] Regarding the war between China and Japan, German business and export people are deeply concerned about the expansion of the scope of the conflict between China and Japan, and say that German trade with China occupies an important position in Germany's total foreign trade, but it has now completely stalled. For example, China recently ordered a large batch of railway materials from Germany that could not be shipped to China, which is one example. Some observers now believe that Germany's future attitude towards the Far East incident may be based on the above-mentioned economic points. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)

### British and Indian Reinforcements Continuously Arrive in Shanghai

10,000-Ton Cruiser Moored in Port Awaiting Orders

[Hong Kong] The authorities here are preparing to send more British troops to Shanghai if necessary. The 10,000-ton cruiser Suffolk has sailed from Wusong to Hong Kong and is moored in Hong Kong. Upon receiving orders, it will immediately transport the Middlesex Regiment and a squadron of Indian horse artillery, which arrived in Hong Kong this morning from Singapore.

⊙Calcutta: The 5th Battalion of the 6th Rajputana Infantry has departed for the Far East today on the SS Elephanta, led by Colonel Ferguson. The 4th Battalion of the 19th Hyderabad Regiment is also scheduled to depart soon. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 24th)

### The Sino-Japanese War Is Bound to Be Protracted

Paris Times Commentary

[Paris] The "Times" recently commented on the Sino-Japanese situation, saying, "Judging from the current situation, a large-scale conflict between China and Japan is bound to be protracted. Will Japan decide to mobilize a large number of troops to protect its military prestige? Will China support a long-term war of resistance on all fronts? The current situation in Shanghai is very chaotic. Foreign concessions continue to suffer from the military influence of both sides, resulting in disturbances. If the safety of the concessions is not respected one day, the future disasters will be unimaginable. After the failure of the British proposal for the neutralization of Shanghai, the major powers are now jointly considering submitting diplomatic negotiations to both China and Japan again. The "Japan Times" has already declared that the war will last for at least one year. However, Japanese Army Minister Sugiyama said that Japan should quickly achieve military victory and never allow the war to be protracted, so it will adopt an offensive strategy. However, whether Japan can win in a short period of time depends on China's military strength. Regarding this level, although there is no definite information to prove it, it seems credible that China has unexpected military strength. As far as Japan is concerned, if the war zone expands more and more, it will not be in Japan's interest. Although Japan does not have to use all its national power to engage in war, it can engage in war with great strength, but after the area of responsibility expands, the military strength is dispersed, and it will naturally be impossible to win quickly. Based on the above difficulties, it is not known whether China and Japan can still open the door to negotiations. If so, countries related to the Far East can find ways to promote this negotiation," (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas telegram)

### Two More Battalions of French Troops Arrived Yesterday

Dutch Destroyer Enters Port

The French Concession authorities dispatched two battalions of French troops to Shanghai yesterday, loaded them into cars and deployed them at various street intersections to defend against emergencies. Sandbags have been heightened on all roads in the concession to prevent any eventuality.

The Dutch government, in view of the large number of Dutch residents in Shanghai, specially sent warships to Shanghai. The Dutch destroyer "Groningen" arrived in Shanghai from Batavia yesterday and is docked on the Bund, gathering with other foreign ships to increase the protective power of the Shanghai Public Concession. It is reported that the ship brought a team of marines, but the number is unknown.

### The National Salvation Public Bond Solicitation Association Was Officially Established

The General Association is located in Shanghai, with branches at home and abroad. The chairmen are Song Ziwen, Sun Ke, etc., as standing committee members.

The National Government, in order to encourage national salvation donations, the Ministry of Finance issued national salvation public bonds of 500 million yuan. After formulating measures for the collection of national salvation public bonds, it was announced on the 20th. Now, in accordance with the provisions of the measures, the "National Salvation Public Bond Solicitation Committee" is organized, and a general association is established in Shanghai, which was formally established yesterday.

The association handles all matters such as publicity and fundraising. It has one chairman and twenty-six standing committee members to handle all affairs, and also has four groups: the general affairs group, the publicity group, the fundraising group, and the audit group. Each group uses clerks as appropriate according to the complexity of the affairs, and cooperates to handle the affairs of each group. The association also establishes branches in important areas abroad and in provinces and cities in China to conduct fundraising separately. The Ministry of Finance has now appointed the general association.

The persons in charge are as follows: ㊀ Chairman Song Ziwen, Vice Chairman Chen Lifu, ㊁ Standing Committee members Sun Ke, Song Qingling, Li Shihui, Liu Shangqing, Ho Tung, Hu Wenhu, Li Qingquan, Jian Dongpu, Zhang Boling, Shi Zhaoji, Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, Yu Hongjun, Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Song Hanzhang, Wang Boqi, Zeng Yangfu, Liu Hangchen, Xu Xinliu, Zhou Song, Li Guoqin, Huang Boquan, Huang Zongyi, Huang Yizhu, Shen Chengzhang, etc., held a standing committee meeting at the association's address on Ferguson Road at 3 pm yesterday to discuss all work steps, and dispersed at about 5 pm.

Correction: Yesterday (23rd), this newspaper's evening edition carried a report that enemy soldiers were stationed on all floors of the North Sichuan Road Post Office. According to a certain gentleman from the post office, the post office is still open for business from 9 am to 5 pm every day, and the director lives and avoids inside at night, and there are no Japanese troops stationed there, etc. This is specifically corrected.

### The Commercial Press Raises 50,000 Yuan for National Salvation Donations

The company and its colleagues each contribute half of the amount. 10,000 taels of gold will be sent monthly starting at the end of this month.

The Commercial Press has stipulated the following measures to raise 90,000 yuan for national salvation donations: ㊀ 50,000 yuan for national salvation losses will be borne equally by the company and all colleagues. ㊁ Half of the 25,000 yuan borne by the company will be deducted from the cash revenue of the Shanghai Distribution Office and the cash remitted by various branches at 5% starting from August 1 until this amount is satisfied. ㊂ Half of the 25,000 yuan borne by colleagues will be used to collect the interest on long-term incentive savings for the six months from April to September of this year. The interest donated by each person in the previous item will be rounded up to 5 jiao if it is less than 5 jiao, and rounded up to 1 yuan if it is more than 5 jiao but less than 1 yuan. ㊃ For donations in the third item, the company will print a voluntary letter, distribute it to depositors for signature and confirmation, and then send it to the accounting department for deduction by the personnel department. When the voluntary donation in the previous item is less than 25,000 yuan, colleagues will make up for it with special donations. ㊄ Those who do not have long-term incentive savings but are willing to make special donations, or those who have long-term incentive savings and are willing to make additional donations, may join. For special donations and additional donations in the previous item, the person should contact the personnel department. Those in branches and factories should contact the managers and factory directors of the respective branches and factories and report to the personnel department. ㊅ The funds jointly donated by the company and its colleagues will be sent by the company to the official receiving agency for national salvation donations in five monthly installments of 10,000 yuan each, from the end of August to the end of December of this year. If there is a balance, it will be included in the fifth month's payment. It is commendable that the company is cooperating with labor and management in this extraordinary period to repay the country with huge sums of money. There are many factories in Shanghai with strong financial resources, and they should be inspired by this.

There were many enemy corpses in the Yunzaobang River and by the bridge. (2) About 2,000 enemy troops who landed in Zhanghuabang south of Yunzaobang were also defeated by us. Only 400-500 people remained, and it is expected that they will be eliminated soon.

The enemy regimental commander was killed by our army, and an enemy air force major was also killed.

It is also learned that some enemy troops landed in Nanhui yesterday afternoon and were all resolved by our army. An enemy standby ship outside Wusongkou was hit and sunk by our artillery. It is also reliably learned that the Kurume Division of the Japanese reinforcements to Shanghai has successively landed in Hongkou, Wusong, Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, and Lion Forest for combat. Because the positions were not secure, they suffered repeated defeats. More than half of them have been killed or injured, and their strength has been sharply reduced and they are completely defeated.

### Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses on Nanhui Beach

Luring the Enemy Deep and Concentrating Firepower to Sweep, Enemy Troops Were Caught Off Guard and Suffered More Than 1,000 Casualties

According to reliable information, at about 6:00 am yesterday, more than a dozen enemy warships, accompanied by dozens of small boats, arrived at the sea off Nanhui Beach and immediately used platoon guns to concentrate firepower and bombard our onshore positions fiercely. After a while, small boats fully loaded with infantry, about 1,200 people, carrying light machine guns and other military equipment, quickly approached the beach. The tide surged ashore. Our defending troops feigned weakness at the time and only used a small number of troops to deal with the enemy. The enemy then took advantage of the situation to go deep. When most of our defending troops waited for the enemy to gain a firm foothold, they used machine guns to concentrate firepower and sweep at the enemy's densely formed teams. At the same time, they used artillery fire to threaten the enemy's retreat. The enemy was in a panic. Our army seized the opportunity to charge and engage in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy was defeated, and there were heavy casualties. In this battle, only a hundred or so enemy troops survived. Our division suffered slight damage.

According to further news, the remaining enemy troops of about one hundred and several tens of people in Nanhui are still being surrounded and intercepted by our army on three sides. Because the beach there is very wide and the way back is cut off by our firepower.

### No Enemy Traces Along the Wusong Coast

There are still 200-300 Remaining Enemies in Yunzaobang, Surrounded by Our Army, Unable to Break Through and Get on Ships

According to reliable information from a certain military agency this morning, at 5:00 am today, it was reported from the front that the enemy who landed in Lion Forest, Paotaiwan, and Wusong had been completely resolved by our army after a day (24th) of sweeping operations. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Currently, there are still 200-300 remaining enemies in Yunzaobang, surrounded by our army and unable to break through and get on ships. They are still struggling. It is expected that they will be wiped out in one fell swoop this morning. Also, enemy corpses are scattered everywhere along the river and cannot be collected. The situation is extremely tragic.

### Two Enemy Warships Sunk After Being Hit

Our Army Has Strong Strength Along the River and Coast, Enemy Troops Will Never Be Able to Cross the Thunder Pond

According to reports from those who returned to Shanghai from the front, at 5:00 pm yesterday, our artillery team densely used heavy artillery to fiercely attack the enemy warships outside Wusongkou that were covering the enemy's landing. Two enemy ships were hit and sunk.

It is reliably learned that the rumors that the enemy troops landing outside the port had broken through our army's line of defense and had penetrated into a certain area are completely unfounded. According to reliable special news from the military, our side has deployed very strong forces at various ports along the river and coast. Recently, we have also reinforced the key points in each place with more than one division of troops. Even if the enemy troops want to desperately open a bloody path, they will absolutely not be able to cross the Thunder Pond.

Central News Agency: This morning (25th), around 0:05 and 1:30, our air force dispatched several times over the Huangpu River and Wusongkou to bomb enemy ships. The moonlight was bright and there were no clouds for thousands of miles, but the sound of engines was incessant. The enemy ships at Songkou and on the Huangpu River used searchlights to shine and fired anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately. Because the drivers were brave and careful and had superb skills, they were still exceptionally active among the enemy ships. Several bombs were dropped at the time, and machine guns were fired. According to several Western passengers on the Canadian Empress, who arrived at Songkou yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning, they witnessed a gunboat anchored outside Songkou being sunk by us and a destroyer being hit in the stern and seriously injured.

### Recent Situation of Jiangwan Position

The Top Floor of the Enemy Headquarters Has Been Confirmed to Be Destroyed by Our Bombing, Last Night's Small Contact, Our Artillery Destroyed the Enemy's Observation Post

This morning, a new mortar platoon leader from the X Division, Chuan Jinshan, arrived at a certain wounded soldier hospital. According to Platoon Leader Fu, who recognized the reporter from this newspaper, he has a long-term stomach problem and took the opportunity to be transferred to the hospital for treatment, and was not injured. The reporter asked about the recent situation on Jiangwan Road. According to him, the enemy troops are still entrenched in the southeast of Jiangwan Road, stubbornly resisting, relying on their extremely solid national defense work. Our army has repeatedly advanced and retreated at Baziqiao, which is a strategic relationship and it is not convenient to go deep, so they are still in a stalemate. At Chizhi College, the battle was very fierce at the beginning, and the school building has now been completely turned into ashes. Our army occupies the northeast corner of Hongkou Park. The top floor of the enemy headquarters at the Jiangwan Road intersection has been confirmed to have been destroyed by our army's artillery fire and bombs. The enemy's air force is very active and flies very low, using machine guns to strafe our positions. The wounded soldiers who entered the hospital today were injured by their air force last night. At about 9:00 pm last night, there was a small contact on Jiangwan Road. Our army's mortar team aimed at the observation post set up by the enemy on the roof of the Kailin Paint Company and bombed it. As a result, the observation post has been destroyed by us. It is learned that the hospital was established by Yousheng Travel Agency and is well-managed.

### The Enemy's Attempt to Shift the Battle Situation Failed

Reinforcing Three Divisions to Relieve the Siege of Hongkou, Our Head-on Pain Sound Landing Attempt Failed

The enemy troops in the Changshu, Hongkou area have fallen into a state of exhaustion, and the time of their annihilation must not be far away. From the beginning, the enemy's battle on this line was in a passive position, controlled by our superior forces, and unable to shift the battle situation. Now, the enemy wants to resolve the crisis in the Shanghai battle situation in order to use quick battles and quick decisions to defeat our army. Therefore, they reinforced three divisions to Shanghai, wanting to land with superior forces, contain the battle situation, and reverse their tragic situation. For several days, they have been attempting to land at various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the coast of Nanhui, but they have been repelled by our army and suffered great losses. It is expected that after suffering this heavy blow, the enemy troops will not dare to invade again in the short term.

### Our Central Route Reaches Broadway Road

Central News Agency, Reliable News This Morning ㊀ Our army's line of defense in Zhabei remains the same.

### Our Planes Hit the Enemy's Left Flank with Bombs

Enemy Planes Dropped Bombs in Our Eastern and Western Districts, But They Were All in the Fields and There Was Not Much Damage

After our air force made three night raids on the enemy's positions and warships last night, according to this morning's investigation, the enemy troops in the Songkou area suffered heavy losses. At the same time, the enemy soldiers in the Pengluojian area of ​​North Sichuan Road were also bombed and hit by a bomb. The explosion occurred immediately, and the enemy troops suffered heavy casualties. Our planes returned safely through the enemy's dense anti-aircraft gun fire.

After suffering this heavy blow, more than a dozen seaplanes and seaplane bombers on the enemy warships flew up urgently at about 5:00 am this morning, divided and returned to various areas in the east and west to scout, and dropped no less than twenty bombs in places such as ××. The huge sound at dawn this morning was also caused by the Japanese planes dropping bombs. However, our side suffered no losses.

Between 10:00 am and 12:00 pm, an enemy plane circled over Shanghai, staying in the sky between Xiaoshadu Road, Daxilu Road, and Nanyang Road for more than ten minutes before flying towards Songkou. Not long after, another enemy seaplane bomber flew up from Songkou and flew towards the southeast. At 11:20, another one was discovered in the sky north of Shanghai and dropped two bombs.

Several enemy planes bombed Pudong and Nanshi wantonly this morning (25th) and flew low to strafe our refugees.

### Wang Jingjiu, Commander of the Division, Inscribed Words for This Newspaper

### There Is a Saying That the Enemy Troops Have Changed Their Commanders

Leading a Reinforced Division to Shanghai, Repeated Landing Failures Drained Their Spirit

Xin Xin She said, reliable news, the enemy troops have indeed been successively sent to Shanghai, about one division, which is drawn from the troops stationed in the country, so the number is about 15,000 people. The rumor that there are two divisions is actually a false show of strength by the enemy. The commander-in-chief is Matsui Ishine, who is here to replace the commander of the Third Fleet, Hasegawa, in charge of the battle. The enemy, who has been trying to land at Wusongkou for several days, is the enemy's reinforcements, but after being severely damaged by our army, the large number of enemy troops trapped in the ships have lost their spirit.

### The Waibaidu Bridge Is Moored by British Warships

The Waibaidu Bridge was parked in front of the park in the evening by enemy warships, relying on the concessions for combat. Today, it has been changed to British warships. The position of the enemy warships has gradually shifted to the east, roughly at the westernmost part of the Huangpu River, and can only be parked in front of the China Merchants Bureau's warehouse. (There is now an enemy transport ship and a destroyer there.) Izumo has also moved one river tube to the east.

The extent of the loss can be imagined.

### Zhangbei Officially Recovered

[Zhangjiakou] Zhangbei is an important town outside the pass, and the enemy regards it as a lifeline. Therefore, it has been repeatedly gained and lost. After a dozen hand-to-hand combats, at 12:00 pm on the 19th, Liu Ruming personally led his troops to climb the city and charge before officially recovering it. The enemy suffered countless casualties and retreated to Baochang and Guyuan. We are sending teams to pursue them. Hundreds of men and women have been successively arrested in Zhang these days and are being interrogated. (20th Special Telegram)

### Our Army Fought Bravely to Repel the Enemy in the Counties of Liangxiang and Fangshan

In Areas Such as Meierling and Lutantan

[Baoding] The troops in Meierling, Lutantan, Pingdingshan, Beicheying, Nanliyuan and other areas in our Liangxiang and Fangshan counties repelled the enemy separately on the morning of the 23rd. At 7:00 am on the 20th, the enemy used a combined force of infantry and cavalry of more than 500 people to launch a fierce attack on our Magaozhuang and Yangtougang positions on the border of Fangshan County under the cover of tanks and artillery fire. Another part of the enemy, about 200 people, advanced towards our Nanguan and Bashimudi positions from the Dafangchang area. The battle situation was extremely fierce. Our officers and soldiers calmly responded to the battle, and the enemy failed. We used guerrilla troops to cross the river from a certain place to attack the enemy's rear. The enemy suffered heavy losses and casualties and retreated in a panic. Also, in the Beicheying area, after our army defeated the invading enemy at 11:00 pm on the 22nd, it captured the surrounding villages and highlands and took advantage of the situation to attack Xiangyuan and Xiaojueer. On the one hand, we sent plainclothes troops to attack Lutantan. The enemy was attacked from the front and back and collapsed. Our army captured Lutantan and the surrounding highlands and advanced to the road from Shan Lutantan to Dafangchang on the 13th morning. At 8:00 am on the 22nd, the enemy once again attempted to counterattack our Beicheying position. Our army fought fiercely. At 2:00 pm, the enemy opened four cannons and bombarded our position with more than 400 shells. At 4:00 pm, the enemy increased to more than 800 people. Our officers and soldiers, seeing the enemy repeatedly reinforcing, knew that its main force had already been shaken and were extremely excited. They engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Because our army's morale was increasing day by day, their courage was taken away. The artillery fire they fired was completely ineffective and disintegrated. Also, in the Shitituli area, the enemy used a combined force of infantry and artillery of more than 500 people to attack our Pingdingshan and Zhaojiazhuang positions and used smoke screens in an attempt to cover up. Our army rushed forward, and another small unit detoured out of the left side of Dingshan and engaged in fierce battles with us, and launched a fierce artillery attack. Our two companies, Dan Moumou, bravely died at this time, but the enemy suffered even more casualties. In the end, our army defeated them. In this battle, the enemy fought with the main force of the Pinghan Line and used various new weapons to help the battle. Our soldiers, without exception, were brave and fought fiercely for the highlands and fought bloodily with the enemy for several days, going in and out seven times. Although the enemy reinforced again, they ultimately failed. The number of their deaths was several times that of ours. The stubborn enemy was very depressed after this blow.

Currently, rice merchants in the production areas are planning transportation methods. River-borne rice that has arrived in transit has been successively loaded onto wharves for sale. However, many of those that were halfway through loading have been resold to Chizhou Port and will not proceed to Shanghai. The local bean and rice industry and the two grain associations of the Bund have dispatched personnel to various production areas to instruct them to continue loading rice to Shanghai and have selected safe towns as trading and unloading locations.

### Enemy Warships Block Ningxing Ship from Entering Wusong

The Ningxing steamship of the North Company of the Shanghai Municipal Council, used to transport refugees to Ningbo, had completed negotiations with all parties. The ship sailed from Guotongsha to Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning, taking advantage of the gradually diminishing gunfire at the Wusongkou, and still flying the Shanghai Municipal Council flag. It was originally scheduled to enter the port at 10:30 AM. However, when the ship arrived at Wusongkou, a Japanese warship suddenly hoisted a red flag, prohibiting it from approaching, or it would open fire. Under this threat, the Ningxing ship turned around and quickly sailed back to Guotongsha to dock. It immediately sent a telegram to Shanghai to report the situation, and the Shanghai Municipal Council is re-negotiating with the Japanese naval commander, requesting that they release the people so that refugees can be transported to Ningbo in the afternoon. The Longshan ship, flying the Italian flag, is also expected to arrive in Shanghai today and will transport refugees to Ningbo.

### Miscellaneous Comments

— Xiang

A telegram from London on the 24th states that China has informed Britain that it is prepared, in principle, to accept Britain's proposal for the joint withdrawal of Chinese and Japanese troops and warships from the Shanghai area. Japan's response has not yet arrived, and the British government is quite disappointed. Japan is an aggressor nation, and our country is a nation that has been invaded. Our country sincerely wishes for peace. However, under the principle of "joint withdrawal," it may be acceptable. Otherwise, we can only offer the advice of "resisting the enemy to the end" and await Japan's own repentance.

The Japan Times claims that the war will last for at least a year. However, Army Minister Sugiyama says that Japan should quickly achieve victory militarily and will not allow it to drag on. Therefore, it will adopt an offensive posture. This statement is truly bizarre. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, when and where has Japan ever taken a defensive posture militarily? Our troops have always taken a defensive posture, waiting quietly for a year or two before speaking again.

### The Pinghan Frontline (3)

— Xi Min

What impressed me most on the front lines were two things: first, the general decline in the morale of the people in the north and the laxity of popular organizations; and second, the particular rampancy of traitorous activities. China has always been a nation of disunity. In recent years, due to the severity of the national crisis, the central and southern provinces of China have trained many militia teams under the attention of the government, which can be regarded as having made some progress. However, in the Hebei Province, past political measures have often been somewhat at odds with the central government, so the training and instruction of farmers, who constitute the vast majority of the population, has always been neglected. Farmers have limited knowledge of national consciousness. Because they lack training and practical understanding, it is simply impossible to enrich and develop it. This shortcoming is particularly serious today, when the entire Chinese nation needs to participate in the war of resistance! The famous German general Ludendorff once said that the unity of the spirit of the entire nation is the basic condition for victory in war. This is truly an immutable conclusion. But in Germany, its war effort is aimed at outward expansion, invading small nations and countries. This war is only for the purpose of securing reasons for Germany's economic relief and acquiring markets for manufactured goods, so the benefits of the war are not for the majority of the Chinese people but for a few upper-class elites. Because of this, in order to mobilize the whole nation to fight and shed blood for the sake of a few capitalists in order to compete for markets, Germany's ambitious soldiers had to create a false theory that the Germanic nation is inherently the most superior, and actively exclude Jews, arguing that communism and religion are Jewish conspiracies. They used such far-fetched methods to unify the spirit of the nation. Although we cannot help but admire the efforts of military conspirators, the people will inevitably recognize the falsity of these theories from the facts. Japan, the only robber in the East, is now mobilizing the entire nation to invade China. The methods and goals of their fascist soldiers are absolutely identical in nature to those of Germany in the West, so their results will be just as unsuccessful. Although the soldiers of the invading country have emphasized the importance of unifying the spirit of the entire nation, the social structure will ultimately make their efforts vanish into thin air.

However, in our China, things are completely different. China is a nation oppressed by Japanese imperialism, and the entire nation unanimously demands to overthrow the enemy who is invading their territory and sovereignty and to strive for national freedom and independence. Therefore, as long as the war of resistance breaks out, the entire nation will unite sincerely and unanimously. Our national spiritual unity does not need to create theories that violate the truth, as Ludendorff did. However, the morale of the people in the north is unexpectedly low, which is almost inexplicable to us, and the laxity of the organization due to the decline of morale is undoubtedly a major defect in the establishment of the great combat power of the entire nation against the enemy. Therefore, the organization and training of the people is particularly necessary in the front. In order to achieve the final victory in the War of Resistance, how to organize and train the people, so that the strength of the people is organically linked to the fighting of the army brothers, should be the most urgent task today. When the reporter met Mr. Wen Guolin, the director of the training department of a certain division on the front line, he talked to me very sincerely about the various difficulties in organizing the people in the front and the difficulty in carrying out political training work in the army. After careful consideration of this issue, I feel that the organization and training of the people in the future must be carried out in close cooperation between the army, the government, and popular organizations in order to achieve results.

On the front lines, we heard many extremely serious rumors that local administrative officials in a few counties had abandoned their cities and fled before the enemy was even discovered. How can such administrative officials lead the people and train the people? Therefore, this reminds me that the national salvation groups in the rear should strive to cultivate personnel who are deeply rooted in the people.

Secondly, regarding the issue of traitors, traitors can be captured from time to time on the front lines. Among these arrested traitors, eight or nine out of ten are poor wretches who cannot solve their livelihood problems and are driven by the enemy at extremely low prices. Their skills are very poor. One night, the reporter stayed at a certain commander's residence on the front line. The station sent a traitor, and asked him where he worked. He said that he was a brother in the 37th Division of the 29th Army. When asked who the commander of the 37th Division was, he was stunned and did not know how to answer. The enemy drives such traitors not to inquire about military intelligence, but mainly to sabotage transportation and so on. For a few dollars, they forget their motherland and risk their lives for the enemy. It is both painful and pitiful to think about.

The reporter has long believed that the most fundamental way to deal with these traitors is to step up the organization and training of the people and raise the people's enthusiasm for patriotism and resistance to the enemy. In this way, the people can directly eliminate the local traitors, making it impossible for the traitors to act. At the same time, the army is indeed very serious about paying attention to traitors, but there are also shortcomings, because I feel that whether it is the government, the army, or popular organizations, there should be a special organization responsible for eliminating traitorous organizations, so that there can be systematic investigation and cracking down. When we capture traitors, we should not only impose severe punishment, but more importantly, we should use various methods to get him to confess his accomplices in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop. This is definitely not something that ordinary military officers or brothers can handle. As a result of the reporter's investigations in various places, many traitors have been transferred east and west after being arrested, and extradited to the second and third agencies for interrogation and sentencing. The time is dragged on for a long time, which can allow the traitor's accomplices to make preparations, and it is naturally much more difficult to capture them. I hope that the government's special service groups should all go to the front lines of the War of Resistance at this time to specialize in eliminating traitors, and popular organizations in the rear should also double their efforts in publicizing and acting to eliminate traitors.

As a result of the reporter's observations on the front lines, I am not concerned about the strength of my country's army's combat capabilities regarding the final victory of our country's War of Resistance. What is most urgent is to pay attention to how the people and the army will become one in the future. I would like to end this article with this sentence, hoping that everyone will pay attention to this issue.

### The Federation of Commerce Associations Calls on Merchants Nationwide to Donate Money to Relieve the National Crisis

Everyone should contribute to the country to the best of their ability. The first national salvation donation will be made up of business income and worker's wages.

The National Federation of Commerce Associations of this city wired to all provincial and district commerce associations and commerce associations at home and abroad yesterday, (Briefly): Extremely Urgent. It has been found that since the Lugouqiao Incident, the bulwark of peace in East Asia has been destroyed by the enemy. The self-defense war of resistance of our Chinese nation has also begun at this time. The recent defense of Nankou, the recovery of Chahar Province, the battle of Shanghai, and the defense of various places, the enemy has exhausted the full power of the navy, army, and air force, and ultimately failed to succeed. This fully demonstrates the central government's determination to respond comprehensively and the loyalty of our front-line soldiers to sacrifice their lives on the border. However, the strong invaders are still not at ease, and the self-defense resistance has a long way to go. At this critical moment, we should strengthen the unity of the people and concentrate the strength of the people to overcome the national crisis together. This month, on July 30th, a telegram was sent to the National Federation of Commerce Associations and people from all walks of life to organize anti-Japanese support associations in various places, and it is assumed that it has been handled accordingly. Now it is the beginning of a long-term resistance, which is also the moment of final sacrifice. All Chinese people should contribute to the country to the best of their ability. Our soldiers have already fought with blood and flesh as the vanguard, and our people should contribute wealth to support the rear. This telegram is sent to your association, hoping that you will investigate and, in addition to working hard to guide free donations, also inform various factories and stores to completely donate one day's business income and various staff and workers to donate one day's wages, collect them to your association, and directly remit them to the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government in the two capitals as the first national salvation donation for merchants nationwide. To save the country by destroying families, Bu Shi was a model in the Han Dynasty, and Zheng Youxian was a model in donating wealth to reward the army. People today should not give way to the ancients. This matter concerns the life and death of the entire nation and country. Please pay attention to handling it carefully and earnestly. Sincerely pray, President Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Commerce Associations of the Republic of China respectfully kowtows.

### Rumors are Rife in Xiamen, and Many Residents are Moving to Gulangyu

Thousands of people have moved to Hong Kong in the past few days. Business circles in southern Fujian automatically refuse enemy goods. Bandits are willingly acting as traitors and are being hunted down.

Xiamen Correspondence. Of the Japanese warships stationed in Xiamen, the cruiser Yubari has been in Xiamen since its arrival on July 9 and has not gone elsewhere. The rest come and go without a fixed pattern and are anchored behind Gulangyu without any other action. Therefore, Xiamen appears to be calm on the surface, but rumors are rampant. Since the 3rd of this month, many people have moved to Hong Kong and Gulangyu. Wealthy people are moving to Hong Kong in large numbers, and middle-class families are moving to Gulangyu. On the 8th and 9th, as many as 1,000 people went to Hong Kong by boat. Including the previous week, a total of more than 3,000 people have gone. On the 12th, several hundred more people went to Hong Kong by boat. Those who returned home after doing business in the Nanyang region and those who have relatives and friends to turn to in the Nanyang region have also traveled to the Nanyang region by British, Dutch, and Philippine ships. The number of people moving to Gulangyu was especially large on the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th. Moving carts and boats can be seen everywhere. According to estimates by rice shops, the population of Gulangyu has increased by more than 10,000 in recent days. Many people from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in the interior have also moved to Gulangyu. In recent years, Gulangyu has lost its importance, and property prices have fallen, with many empty houses. However, within a few days, they have all been rented out. Families with spare houses and landlords with houses to vacate are also renting them out, and many are renting houses in case they need to move. Rents have soared, increasing fourfold compared to normal times, and contracts are only allowed if four months' rent is paid in advance. As for the prices of goods on Gulangyu, they have also risen sharply, which shows the unease in people's hearts.

The military and political circles in the interior of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou are very active in preparing for emergencies, and the anti-Japanese support movement and the fundraising movement are also very enthusiastic. The merchants and people of the counties in southern Fujian have automatically refused enemy goods and have held meetings to establish oaths. They will be implemented immediately. For example, all merchants in Anxi swore not to buy or sell enemy goods, and those who violate the oath will be regarded as traitors. Stone Code cloth merchants swore that those who violate the oath three times will be subject to the confiscation of all property. On the 11th, the Shishi cloth merchants returned the shipped enemy goods in their original boxes to Xiamen. All other counties are doing the same.

A small number of frustrated bandits in southern Fujian have recently engaged in traitorous activities, such as Zhang Xiongnan and Chen Weijin, who have gone back to Dehua and Nan'an in Jinjiang, and Lü Zhenshan and Guo Zong, who have contacted certain parties in Xiamen and Hong Kong. However, Zhang and Chen are difficult to suppress because of their scars, and Lü has only a few hundred people and is being besieged in Yongchun. Guo has only 20 or 30 people. Zheng Mingzhi, the current captain of the Quan Shui De car road guard team, was bought by a certain party to be the head of the traitors in Jinjiangnan'an. On the night of the 7th, Zheng went from Jiudu in Nan'an to Quanzhou City and was surrounded and arrested by the garrison on Dajie Street. Zheng escaped by car that night. A search of the city that night yielded nothing. On the night of the 8th, the garrison captured Zheng's wife, Xie Xiuying, his son, Zheng Jinchun, and nine others in Jiudu and sent them to Quanzhou. They also confiscated the weapons of Zheng's road guard team in Honglai. According to reports, Zheng was originally a famous bandit in southern Fujian and served as a battalion commander in Chen Guohui's troops. He owned a number of firearms. Last year, he served as the captain of the Quan Yong De road guard team and was then bought by a certain party. He moved his family to Jiudu, and he himself often took his own car to run around Quanzhou and Yongchun, and his activities were mysterious.

### Yangzhou Captures Disguised Enemy Spy

—Also Detains Several Suspects—

Yangzhou Dispatch: The Jiangdu Police Bureau on the morning of the 18th, arrested a person of unknown nationality who did not speak the language, resembling an enemy spy. He was escorted to the county government, where Magistrate Ma interrogated him and provided paper and pen, ordering him to write a confession. He wrote the characters "Door Hundred Big Three." He was immediately sent to the political police station. This reporter, upon receiving the news, went to investigate and saw him bareheaded and barefoot, wearing only dirty white cloth shorts, looking like a beggar. However, his eyes were bright and piercing. He had foot bindings. He sat with his knees bent, his soles facing upwards, supporting his buttocks. He was also instructed to write his origins, and he wrote "Exit Pass People" not door path "Plant Middle Fire" light ash born sky fire □" and other characters. At that time, the court was opened again, and this reporter attended the hearing. The interrogating officer interrogated him in Japanese, but he mumbled continuously, with only one phrase discernible, sounding like the Shanghai dialect for "twenty-one years old." The interrogating officer, unable to proceed, sent him back to detention. Later, a request was made to detain him with the special affairs team. It was reported that he had previously been in a certain field in the western suburbs, where he was arrested and sent to the police station. However, after interrogation, there was no recordable confession. He was released on parole and police were dispatched to follow him back to his residence, but he returned to the police station and was sent to the county government. After the court hearing, an examination of his physique showed that his skin color from his waist to below his knees was white, proving that his hair, skin, face, and appearance were all disguised. According to several cart pullers, a month ago, he had been disguised as a semi-mute and foolish beggar around the bridge in the sixth district of Yiling County. The Yiling police station on the morning of the 18th, escorted a suspected traitor, Wang Yunru (from Hebei), to Yangzhou. Wang had only practiced medicine in Yiling for a short time when he was inspected by the local Baozhang (chief of a bao, a unit of local administration), and the police searched his residence, seizing nine seals, a diary, a detailed map of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line, a map of Zhenjiang, and two personal business cards with the title of former Songjiang County Physician. He is currently being interrogated at the police station. On the same day, a young man surnamed Shen, who lived in the alley opposite the Longevity Temple in the city, who usually wore Western suits and leather shoes, suddenly disguised himself as a vegetable vendor and cut telephone lines, which was discovered. He is suspected of being a traitor and was also arrested by a certain agency. Another young man surnamed Meng is being held for interrogation.

### Hospital Visit to Refugee Mothers

— Ping

Twins, six-month miscarriage, mother's life in danger. Funding is insufficient, hoping for enthusiastic donations from all sectors.

(Special Report from this Newspaper) Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, compatriots from the war zones have crowded into the concessions, and some have even come from the four suburbs of Shanghai. They have managed to save their lives, but their property may have already been sacrificed in the fierce artillery fire. Who caused these countless homeless refugees to encounter such a tragic situation? This is something we must clearly understand. Our lives and property can be sacrificed, but we must give the ambitious aggressors of militarist countries a head-on blow. This reporter has visited several refugee shelters. Although they feel the sadness of wives and children being separated and families being destroyed, they eagerly hope for the "final victory," and they believe that the "final victory" belongs to us.

Currently, according to statistics, there are about 120,000 refugees in Shanghai and more than 200 shelters. The shelters provide two bowls of porridge and one meal a day, so survival is naturally not a problem. However, there are many expectant mothers among the refugees, and we should plan for them as soon as possible. Therefore, six female obstetricians from Huimin and Renhe Hospitals, Zhang Liling, Sheng Mingqi, Yan Yongjiang, Guo Huizhen, Lu Mingyu, and Zhang Biru, along with Mr. Wang Yuefeng, organized a "Shanghai Refugee Maternity Hospital." The hospital is temporarily located at 1085 Gordon Road, at the Living Kindergarten. This reporter made a special visit this morning.

After sending in a business card, Dr. Sheng Wenqi very diligently hosted a tour of the facilities. First, we went to the delivery room, where a delivery bed was placed in the center, and against the wall were two cabinets filled with surgical instruments and various medicinal liquids. Because part of the school was used for the setup, the equipment is naturally a bit simple. But for pregnant women, this is such a great manifestation of the spirit of human mutual assistance.

The wards are three classrooms, with a total of eighty beds now. The number can be increased to one hundred if needed. Deliveries are handled by the six doctors mentioned above, with Miss Zhang Liling as the chief physician. She went to Osaka, Japan, to study at the Red Cross Hospital last January, and because of the outbreak of the Shanghai War, she returned to the country to establish this "Refugee Maternity Hospital." There are nine nurses, three of whom were sleeping in the ward last night because they were on the night shift. This spirit of service deserves commendation!

There are currently two pregnant women in the hospital. One was sent from the Nanyang Wireless Telegraph Training School on Baylor Road (which also houses refugees). Perhaps the fetus was injured while fleeing, and she miscarried last night. The fetus was only four months old. Who is responsible for this innocent little life? I can't help but ask. Fortunately, the mother is safe.

The other was sent from the Great World Shelter. She was also injured on the day of the bombing and miscarried at six months, and they were twins. Dr. Sheng also guided me to see this pair of ill-fated infants. They were placed quietly in a porcelain basin like a pair of kittens, their eyes closed. They did not see the brutal actions of the militarist country. Is this fortunate or unfortunate? The mother bled excessively because the placenta did not come out for a long time during the miscarriage, and she may have caught a cold during the typhoon that passed through Shanghai that day. She now has "postpartum fever" and has not yet emerged from the danger period. When this reporter went to the ward, I saw her staring at us. Her face was as pale as wax paper, and her breathing was a bit rapid. I originally wanted to ask her about her escape and the miscarriage, but seeing such a tragic situation, how could I bear to ask her to speak? She may be thinking of her husband, whose survival is uncertain, and her two lovely children. This is truly an extreme human tragedy!

Dr. Sheng finally told me that this "Refugee Maternity Hospital" is a private organization, and funding is not very sufficient. She hopes that all sectors will make enthusiastic donations. This not only benefits pregnant women but is also a very important task for the rear.

One more thing to clarify is that the hospital accepts pregnant women sent from various refugee shelters or with a valid certificate. Even if you call, they will still make house calls. The telephone number is 37766.
