### The Situation in Beiping and Tianjin is Worrying, Japanese Troops on the Front Lines Continue to Increase

Kawagoe has no preparation to come to Beijing for negotiations. Japan’s intentions are unfathomable, it is rumored there are other plans. Kashii's illness worsens, Hashimoto acts in his place.

[Tianjin] The situation in Beiping and Tianjin is extremely worrying. After Feng Zhi’an’s troops retreated, although there has been no fighting on the front lines, the Japanese side has delayed withdrawing its troops, and their intentions are unfathomable. Military staff are running around and active, with other new plans. The overall situation will develop within a few days. (This newspaper’s urgent telegram at 2:10 AM on the 24th)

[Tianjin] Kashii is currently seriously ill and unable to get out of bed. The affairs of the Japanese military in Tianjin are being handled by Chief of Staff Hashimoto. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)

[Nanjing] Evening News reports reliable information that regarding the issue of ceasefire and troop withdrawal between China and Japan, as of noon on the 23rd, the telegrams received in Beijing only mention the withdrawal of a small portion of troops. However, the extent to which negotiations should determine the withdrawal, and the boundaries of the area, have not been reported in detail by Song Zheyuan. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)

[Beiping] Song Zheyuan handles political affairs. He arrived at the political affairs committee to work at 7:00 AM this morning. (Telegram on the 23rd)

[Tianjin] After half a month of negotiations over the Lugouqiao Incident, the military conflict has come to an end as of the 22nd. If the Japanese army does not create further problems, the situation may temporarily ease. However, the Japanese troops on the front lines have not yet fully withdrawn. Whether the situation can be restored to the state before the 8th, and whether the Kwantung Army will return to outside the pass, is of great importance. Ambassador Kawagoe has consistently shown no preparation to return to Beijing for negotiations, and the future is not optimistic. However, according to news from the local authorities, if the Japanese army sincerely withdraws its troops, it is expected that the situation can be restored to the state before the 8th within a week. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)

[Tianjin] The deployment of Japanese troops has not stopped at all. According to information from the road, five trains of Japanese soldiers are still stopped in Qinyu, and there are indications that they will continue to move west. On the morning of the 23rd, it was also heard that more than forty Japanese heavy-duty trucks loaded with a large amount of military supplies went to Fengtai. At 5:00 PM, forty-odd empty heavy-duty trucks returned to Tianjin. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)

### Japanese Troops in Da Jing Village Opened Fire Again Yesterday

[Beiping] At 5:00 AM this morning, Japanese troops in Dajing Village fired five shells at our army’s defense lines again. We have once again raised a question with them. Katō is going to Tianjin today to meet Kawagoe to report on the Lugouqiao case and ask for instructions on everything. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)

[Beiping] According to those who fled from Dajing Village to Beiping for refuge, the Japanese troops have indeed withdrawn from the railway line, but only by a distance of about one or two li. The number of Japanese troops in the Dajing Village and Wulidian area has not decreased. The Japanese troops close to the railway line are under strict guard, with a machine gun post set up every fifty steps. All important road crossings leading to Beiping and Fengtai are guarded by Japanese troops, who conduct detailed interrogations of passersby. There is no sign of them withdrawing back to Fengtai in the short term. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)

### The Agreed-Upon Steps for Troop Withdrawal Between Both Sides

[Beiping] When both sides decided to withdraw troops on the 20th, it was originally divided into three steps: ㊀ Our side withdraws troops from the Yamenkou and Babaoshan area; ㊁ The Japanese side withdraws troops from the Wulidian, Dajing Village, and Dawayao area; ㊂ Our side withdraws troops west of Lugouqiao, restoring the previous situation. Up to now, a large number of Japanese troops in the Dajing Village and Wulidian area have not withdrawn, and the Japanese army is withdrawing during the day and increasing at night, which is baffling. Negotiations are continuing with the Japanese side. (This newspaper's telephone report at 3:25 AM on the 24th)

### Lugouqiao Once Faced a Tense Situation

[Beiping] In the Lugouqiao, Dajing Village, and Dawayao area, there are approximately two to three thousand Japanese troops. As of the afternoon of the 23rd, there was still no preparation for withdrawal. Moreover, several artillery units were added on the 22nd. That night, they went to the Shagang Heights southeast of the Lugouqiao Station, set up the artillery pieces, and aimed the muzzles at Wanping County, the Lugouqiao Stone Bridge, and Changxindian. After our side received the report, the security team in the city immediately went to the city walls to be on guard. At the same time, our troops in the Lugouqiao area were also prepared to move out. The reporter happened to enter the city for inspection at this time. Due to the severity of the situation, he left the city after a one-week inspection. By 8:00 PM, the situation had eased. As of the afternoon of the 23rd, there had been no conflict, and both sides were still in a stalemate. According to the agreement, the Japanese troops attacking the Wanping County and Lugouqiao area should have withdrawn on the 22nd, but as of the 23rd, they had not yet done so. Their repeated breaches of agreement have long been known to the world. It is expected that the future will still be difficult to be optimistic about. According to one of our military officers, in the battle at the Huilong Temple northeast of Lugouqiao, the enemy and we engaged in close combat several times. In the end, due to the power of our army's broadswords and the spirit of patriotism, dozens of enemy soldiers were killed. Therefore, the enemy army buried landmines to prevent our army from charging. At noon on the 23rd, there were rumors that a small portion of Japanese troops in Wulidian had withdrawn, but this has not been confirmed. According to Jin soldiers on the front lines, the Japanese army often declares withdrawal during the day, but then advances again at night. Therefore, a large-scale withdrawal is not credible. Wanping County and Lugouqiao are currently defended by our security team. Once the Japanese army withdraws according to the agreement, the 29th Army stationed in the area will also withdraw. There are no Japanese troops at the Lugouqiao Station, and everything is under the control of our personnel. The highlands about half a li southeast of the station are garrisoned by Japanese troops. When the reporter took the Pinghan train past the area at 2:00 PM on the 23rd, he saw the Japanese troops still in the trenches aiming at our troops about one li away, and they were still building trenches, with no sign of withdrawing. There are many bullet marks in front of Lugouqiao, which is now guarded by our soldiers. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)

### Japanese Heavy Bombers Depart for China

[Nanjing] According to information, Japanese military supplies are still being shipped to our country in a steady stream. Osaka recently detained seventeen merchant ships for military transport. In addition, fifty Japanese military aircraft, including a squadron of heavy bombers, departed from Japan yesterday for standby. The Japanese Air Force commander also flew along with the aircraft. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)

[Baoding] At 12:00 noon on the 23rd, a Japanese reconnaissance plane reconnoitered at low altitude over the station for a long time before leaving. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)

[Beiping] Aircraft have been constantly flying and circling over Beiping city for several days. From 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the 23rd, several Japanese aircraft flew over Beiping city one after another, as well as Nanyuan, Beiyuan, Xiyuan, and Lugouqiao, conducting low-altitude reconnaissance in the suburbs. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)

[Beiping] A Japanese plane circled over Beiping today for half an hour. At night, everything was quiet in the Wanping and Babaoshan positions. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)

[Zhengzhou] At 3:55 PM on the 23rd, another Japanese aircraft reconnoitered over Bian, then headed west. At 4:05 PM, it arrived over Zhengzhou, circled once, flew north, reconnoitered at high altitude over the Yellow River Railway Bridge, and then flew northeast. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)

### Kawagoe Stays in Tianjin to Meet with Local Authorities

[Tianjin] According to local officials here, the Chinese and Japanese troops at Lugouqiao have begun to withdraw, and the incident that occurred this time has come to an end. After the Lugouqiao Incident, a large number of Japanese troop trains came to Tianjin and transferred to Fengtai. Sources said that a total of 30 troop trains had arrived from outside the pass, with more than 7,000 personnel, more than 1,200 horses, and other items such as tanks, cars, and 30-40 airplanes. They are currently stationed in Tianjin, Fengtai, and other places, and there is no intention of withdrawing. Personnel from the Japanese military have unofficially indicated to officials that the mobilization of Japanese troops is complicated, and they will gradually withdraw after a short wait, but there is no date. Kawagoe is still in Tianjin. On the morning of the 23rd, Nagai, the Japanese consul stationed in Tianjin, visited Secretary-General Ma Yanchong of the municipal government, stating that the Lugouqiao case has been resolved and expressed his respect for the municipal government's maintenance of the local area in the past. It is said that Sogawa, the president of Xingzhong Corporation, and Sakatani, the director of the South Manchuria Railway Company, arrived in Tianjin on the 22nd.

[Beiping] The situation in North China is still worrying. Japanese troops increased their military strength in Wanping and Lugouqiao again on the afternoon of the 23rd. There is currently a company of Chinese troops in Babaoshan, and the Chinese troops in Yamenkou have been withdrawn.

The presence or absence of Japanese troops will depend entirely on the situation. (Central News Agency Reuters telegram on the 23rd)

### Imai Expresses No Intention to Withdraw Troops

[Beiping] Imai stated that whether the Japanese front-line army will completely withdraw will depend on whether the Chinese army has the sincerity to withdraw first before gradually withdrawing. The time is not yet right. After the front-line army withdraws to Fengtai, whether it will be stationed in Fengtai, transferred to other places, or transferred back to its home country will depend on the Chinese side. There has been no conflict near Lugouqiao recently. Whether the reinforcement units that the Japanese side has transferred into the pass after the Lugouqiao Incident will be demobilized or transferred back outside the pass will depend on the orders of the Ministry of the Army.

### Japanese Aggression Against North China Was a Premeditated Scheme

The *North-China Daily News* reports that the current Lugouqiao Incident is not merely an attempt by Japan to resolve the issue of Chinese troops in Hebei Province. This can be known by looking back at past events. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has planned to gradually develop and deepen its influence towards the area beyond the Chinese Eastern Railway according to its agenda. For example, in November 1931, Japan earnestly declared that it would never cross the railway line and even claimed to have no relationship with Puyi. However, by the end of the month, it attacked Qiqihar. The following April, it established the "Manchukuo" and installed Puyi as its ruler. Later, it formally announced that it did not want to seize Jehol, but in the winter of that year, it annexed the province, as well as part of Hebei Province. The section of the Beining Railway line reaching Shanhaiguan was also included. Then it began to covet Chahar Province. In the summer of 1935, it took the opportunity to establish the "East Hebei Autonomous Government" and created a demilitarized zone. In the winter of 1936, it again sought to achieve its goals in Suiyuan by exploiting the rebellion of Mongolian troops. However, Chinese troops resisted bravely and were not successful. However, in September of that year, it occupied Fengtai on a pretext. As a result, the control of both the Beining and PingSui Railways fell entirely into the hands of the Japanese. On June 29th of this year, while Soviet and Japanese diplomatic representatives were discussing the division of land rights for islands in the Heilongjiang River, Lieutenant General Honma of the Japanese Army returned home from England, where he had attended the coronation of the British monarch. This lieutenant general was experienced, insightful, and highly respected by the Japanese. When asked about Soviet military vehicles, he replied that the Soviet army had been greatly shaken by Stalin's purges and was currently not worth paying attention to. Consequently, on July 1st, Japan adopted a tough stance on its demands regarding Heilongjiang, which, although resolved after mutual concessions, was actually unfavorable to the Soviet Union. In the first week of July, rumors of impending movements by Japanese troops in Beiping spread, causing considerable unrest. As expected, on July 7th, the current incident was triggered during Japanese military exercises near Lugouqiao. What Japan is most concerned about in the Chinese hinterland is securing the economic benefits it hopes to gain from occupying Manchuria. To solidify these benefits, it must be able to resist Soviet attacks. Although, as Lieutenant General Honma said, there is no need to fear this at present, it is difficult to guarantee that the Soviet Union will not become an enemy of Japan in the future. Therefore, it is now taking advantage of the Soviet Union's inability to focus on external affairs to make the left wing of the line from Heilongjiang to Suiyuan deeply rooted and flawless, so that it can concentrate on the economic issues it values most. This move will make "Manchukuo" and North China an economic unit. If "Manchukuo" does not have direct trade relations with North China, it will not be able to obtain the benefits of occupying the area. Hebei and its northern regions have abundant natural resources. Japan intends that once it can control these resources, not only can the economic success of occupying Manchuria be achieved, but also the economic needs of the home country can be guaranteed. Therefore, the opportunity that Japan has gained today to amass a large army in North China seems to have been created with careful consideration, in order to take the opportunity to carve out another large corner of important Chinese territory. To say that this incident was not premeditated is truly burying one's head in the sand. Japan's foreign policy has once again been overcome by the ambitions of the military, and a tragic drama may begin again.

A Harbin dispatch from the *North-China Daily News* on July 15th reports that although there is little information about the North China Incident here, Japanese troops are very busy transporting supplies on the railway lines and in the Songhua River. Transports pass through here continuously, heading for North China or the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan. Many bombers stationed near the Russian border in recent months have also been moved. The Japanese currently do not seem to fear a Soviet invasion. Locals are therefore puzzled by the Japanese attack on Soviet gunboats in the Heilongjiang River several weeks ago, which was likely intended to test whether the Soviet Union would take a tough course of action or simply end the matter with a protest. The number of Japanese soldiers killed or wounded in the attack is unknown. It is reported that at the funeral of the two Russian soldiers killed in Hailanpao, speakers vowed to avenge this humiliation.

### The Illusion of Peace

— Hua

In recent days, due to the retreat of our troops from Lugouqiao, the situation in North China on the surface seems to have gradually eased from tension to peace. As a result, some people feel that the most serious stage of the situation has passed, and we have avoided war and achieved peace. This psychology of hoping for peace through luck is reflected in the trend of the public bond market and the current neglect of the situation in Peiping and Tianjin. In reality, such an illusion of peace is a major crisis in our movement to resist the enemy and save the nation.

We should point out that when the initial conflict broke out at Lugouqiao, our brave 29th Army defended our territory and fought to the death, inspiring the entire nation to respond in unison, we were grasping the most favorable and optimistic conditions for resisting the enemy and saving the nation. However, after enduring the enemy's repeated insincere ceasefires, mobilizing large reinforcements from outside the passes and from their own country, and then treacherously bombing the suburbs of Beiping and Wanping, while at the same time coercing the Hebei-Chahar authorities to hold negotiations in Tianjin and accept humiliating conditions, these humiliating conditions are now being implemented one by one. At this time, although we see a superficially easing atmosphere in Beiping and Tianjin, in reality it is precisely indicating that another great shame and humiliation for our nation has been created. And in the near future, the extremely dangerous situation in North China will unfold even more rapidly.

We only need to consider: The 100,000 Japanese troops have already concentrated in Hebei. Will they quickly retreat? The Tianjin postal authority has been interfered with. The Tanggu pier has been occupied. The entire Beining Railway has been seized. What kind of situation will Hebei become? Furthermore, the loyal and courageous 29th Army under Feng Zhi'an has been transferred away from Beiping. The strategically important area of ​​the Baishi Mountain in western Beiping is now defended by security forces. What a heartbreaking blow this will be to the loyal and courageous soldiers! And the vast old capital of Beiping has no troops to defend it, allowing the enemy army to run rampant. In other words, Beiping City will become like eastern Hebei. How serious is this development? Moreover, the 17th Division is stationed in Zhuozhou, and Lugouqiao, this military stronghold, will follow in the footsteps of Juejue Terrace and become the object of Japanese control. In the future, the northern end of the Pinghan Railway will again fall into the hands of the enemy. How precarious will the situation in western Shanxi and southern Hebei be?

All of the above points are absolutely contrary to the four ultimate positions of our country stated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in his speech on the 17th. This situation is obviously intolerable to the people of the entire country. The basis for the Japanese actions at present is the agreement they signed with Zhang Zizhong in Tianjin on the 19th. The contents of this agreement have not been published, but the Japanese side believes that the agreements previously signed between the Japanese side and the local authorities of Hebei and Chahar have all been recognized by the central government, so this agreement will naturally not be a problem. The government of our country should issue the most severe refutation of this absurd and outrageous statement.

We believe that all past agreements that have damaged our country's territorial sovereignty should not be recognized. And the agreement that the Japanese side coerced the Hebei-Chahar authorities into signing this time should be refuted immediately. The transfer of the loyal and courageous troops of the 29th Army, the obstruction of activities to resist the enemy and save the nation in Beiping, and the permission for 100,000 invading troops to stay within our borders will create a very serious crisis in North China in the future. At this time, every Chinese person must not harbor the slightest illusion of peace. We believe that the dangerous situation created by the invaders in North China has reached the final point of our endurance. We must concentrate all the power of those above and below to strike head-on against the invaders' conspiracy to plunder North China.

[Tokyo] The Diet is scheduled to hold a special session on the 25th. The Emperor will personally attend the opening ceremony. The first matter will likely be the passage of a resolution supporting the government's policy toward the North China Incident. It is also expected to pass a resolution expressing gratitude to the Japanese garrison in North China. The Diet opening ceremony must be held before the Emperor on Sunday. But the Diet has already convened this morning at 9 AM to elect various committees of the House of Representatives. Koyama, a key member of the Minseitō party, has been elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Kanemitsu, a key member of the Seiyūkai party, has been elected Deputy Speaker. On Sunday, the Diet will engage in various debates and other routine matters. Regular business will begin on Tuesday, at which time Premier Konoe, Foreign Minister Hirota, and Navy Minister Hoshino will attend and deliver speeches. Judging from the situation, the government can safely pass through the special session of two weeks. (Central News Agency, 23rd)

[Tokyo] The 71st special session of the Diet was convened on the 23rd and formalities were completed. The House of Representatives will be established as soon as the departments are determined on the 24th. The House of Peers will hold the opening ceremony on the 25th, and the House of Representatives will convene on the same day. The House of Peers is scheduled to proceed with deliberations on the 26th. After delivering policy speeches on the 27th, debates will begin. Due to the state of affairs, all parties in both houses have decided to advocate a national unity stance to support the current cabinet. As all bills are those resubmitted at the end of the previous Diet, there will be no special turbulence in this session. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] Premier Konoe will deliver a policy speech at the special Diet session. A draft has already been submitted for discussion at the cabinet meeting today. The Army and Navy Ministers and other cabinet members all expressed various opinions, which have not yet been concluded. It is planned that the cabinet will decide on the 24th, and the government's policy must be clearly communicated to the people regarding this North China Incident. Therefore, Director-General Taki of the Legislation Bureau will revise it again, and then submit it to the cabinet for endorsement. (Domei, 23rd)

### British Indulgence Fuels Japanese Aggression

Russian Newspaper Issues Strong Criticism, Chinese Resistance Grows Stronger

[Moscow] *Pravda* states, "Japan's aggression in North China is, of course, a major blow to the interests of other capitalist countries, and especially to Britain. However, we must point out that the British government has adopted a policy of compromise and indulgence towards aggressors in both the Far East and Europe. This policy, such as the recent commencement of British-Japanese talks, is unequivocally beneficial to the aggressive plans of Japanese imperialism. The incident in North China is part of Japan's preparation for a major war on the continent, and must be given serious attention." (TASS, 22nd)

[Moscow] *Izvestia* published an article that bitterly criticized the significance of the North China Incident. It began by saying, "The events of July 1937 bear a great resemblance to the Japanese seizure of Manchuria in the 'September 18th' Incident of 1931. It is easy to point out that, as six years ago, Japan is concentrating troops to intimidate China, while at the same time pretending to be calm in the hope of reducing the attention of the great powers. This significant similarity leads observant observers to believe that the current North China Incident is merely the first stage of a long-planned and comprehensive Japanese plan to conquer China for the second time. The success of Japan's occupation of Manchuria in the 'September 18th' Incident was the result of the passive attitude adopted by the Western European powers. There is no doubt about this. And Britain's open indulgence was the main factor in promoting Japanese aggression. At that time, a segment of British politicians completely misjudged the relationship between the powers in the Far East, believing that after Japan occupied Manchuria, it would not expand into China but would develop in other directions. Today, Britain is once again tending to adopt the same position as in 1931, which is truly lamentable and strange.

"The British Conservative newspapers, as six years ago, are still attempting to downplay the North China Incident, as if it has nothing to do with the interests of other countries. In other words, they are actually supporting the Japanese military clique and helping it cover up its well-prepared military actions. The British Conservatives are now repeating a policy in the Far East that has failed in the past, not only in the Far East, but also in East Africa and Western Europe. Conservative politicians are clearly intimidated by shows of force and intimidation, regardless of whether these methods come from the Far East or Central Europe."

*Izvestia* went on to point out that in 1931 Japan announced that its aggression would be limited to the territory of Manchuria, but in the end, it completely broke its promise and seized Rehe, created the puppet "government" of Eastern Hebei, forced the establishment of the so-called Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and seized six counties in northern Chahar. "Today, Japan is once again using force to occupy Beiping and Tianjin in North China, and is progressively preparing to invade central China by force. And its activities in Taiwan and other places even more clearly prove that southern China is also within its aggressive plans. In this situation, what is the use of still attempting to obtain a promise from the Japanese military clique to only partially continue their expansion plans? The only time that Japan will abandon its aggressive plans is when a certain government stops indulging such plans."

*Izvestia* then elaborated on the fact that British Under-Secretary of State Cranborne denied in May 1937 that Britain "intended to disrespect China's sovereignty," and asked, "Does not Britain's current erasure of the extreme importance of the North China Incident mean that Britain does not respect China's sovereignty? Not only that, but it even means that Britain is abandoning its interests in China, while at the same time demonstrating that London is repeating its miscalculations about the relationships between powers in the Far East."

Finally, *Izvestia* discussed the fundamental difference between the events of July 8th, 1937 and the "September 18th" Incident of six years ago, saying, "Without mentioning the decisive factor of the Soviet Union's many times stronger national power, there are also two points that should be pointed out. Since the past six years, the Chinese people's anti-Japanese movement has developed significantly, while Japan's rear has been greatly weakened and disturbed due to six years of adventurous policies. The current high prices in Japan, the expansion of the strike wave, the difficulties of financial rescue, and many other factors prove that the launch of this new stage of aggression against China is taking place under conditions of extreme domestic instability. On the other hand, since the outbreak of the new Sino-Japanese conflict, we have seen the increasingly strong development of China's anti-Japanese movement. At the same time, national consciousness and the people's hatred of the invaders have also been extremely aroused.

A few years ago, Britain's position in fact determined Japan's victory. Now, a serious moment has come again. The world powers, especially Britain, must again adopt a definite position. Will the North China Incident and the attitude of the powers toward it become the most important factor in the international situation?" (TASS, 22nd)

### British House of Commons Re-Discusses North China Issue

Japan Refuses Third-Party Intervention, Japanese Ambassador to Britain States

[London] The British House of Commons re-discussed the North China issue this afternoon. Conservative MP Hepworth asked, in view of Japan's continued annexation of Chinese territory, could Foreign Secretary Eden declare that the British government would also refuse to recognize future annexations, as in the case of the Three Northeastern Provinces? Eden replied that the situation had not yet developed to that extent, so Hepworth's question seemed premature. Eden added that he hoped Hepworth would no longer expect him to predefine the government's attitude. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 22nd)

[London] Regarding the North China Incident, the British government is now actively urging the United States to jointly act as a mediator. According to the *Evening Standard*, France will also participate in this action, but the hope of success is very slim, because in addition to the United States not necessarily participating in the mediation, the Japanese government strongly rejects any intervention. It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Britain has solemnly stated to British Foreign Secretary Eden that if the Japanese government were to accept any foreign mediation at the beginning of this crisis, it would inevitably arouse public anger throughout the country and overthrow the government. (National Seafarers News, 23rd)

### Eastern Newspaper's Opinion

[Tokyo] The Japanese newspapers do not consider the redeployment of the 37th Division in North China as a solution to the North China situation, believing that the fundamental points of the conflict still exist. Unless the root of the trouble is eradicated, future disputes will continue to arise. It is expected that Japan's policy regarding this matter will undergo major changes. According to the *Asahi Shimbun*, the Japanese government is advocating sending a key politician to Nanjing to begin negotiations on a fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese problem. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 23rd)

(Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)

### A Collection of Information from Northern Chahar

[Zhangjiakou] During the evolution of the incident, the situation in northern Chahar is: ㊀ Several Japanese officers have been flying between Rehe and Huade in two or three planes, and have been holding secret meetings at each destination. They have been doing this for more than ten days without interruption, in a hurried manner, with extremely confidential content. ㊁ Special agents in Huade and Zhangbei are actively purchasing grains and miscellaneous items from various parts of northern Chahar and transporting them to Rehe, to be stored for military use in wartime. ㊂ Military transportation between Zhangjiakou and Duolun is frequent. Military supplies from Huade are being transported back to Duolun. ㊃ The airport at Shangdu, which was rushing to completion, has been suspended. Of the more than 500 workers employed, young and strong men have been selected and enlisted into the ranks by bandits. ㊄ Li Shou-hsin has not yet returned. It is said that Li is in Chengde, and another says he is still detained in the puppet capital. (Special Dispatch, 23rd)

### New Economic Agreement Established Between Japan and Italy

Regulating Mutual Commercial Relations, Sugimura Transferred to Ambassador to France

[Rome] Sugimura Yōtarō, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, went to Paris this morning at 11:00 to take up his new post as Ambassador to France. Representatives from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and embassies of various countries were all at the station to welcome him. Before leaving Rome, Sugimura Yōtarō had negotiated an agreement with the Italian government to regulate the mutual commercial relations between Japan and the Italian colonies, but without any clauses of a political nature. According to reports, Japan's trade with the Italian colonies has always been carried out through merchants from India, Jewish countries, and the Near East. In the future, it will be replaced by the Italian economic system. As for the rumors that Abyssinian Emperor Selassie had granted concessions to Japan, and that Japan had requested the United States government to maintain this, these are not accurate. It is said that Japan did not obtain this concession. (Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)

### Britain and Italy Plot and Struggle for Supremacy in the Mediterranean

Rumors of Italy Building Fortresses on Spanish Islands, Modernization of Gibraltar Port Fortress

[Paris] It is rumored that the islands of Mahon and Ibiza in the Spanish Balearic Islands have been taken over by 600 Italian military experts, who have installed long-range artillery there to control the Mediterranean. It is claimed that the two islands have begun to be transformed into Mediterranean fortresses, with anti-aircraft guns, naval guns, underground aircraft hangars, machine rooms, powder magazines, and airfields large enough to accommodate 40 naval aircraft. In view of this rumor, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has begun investigating it today. At the same time, it is reported that Italian officers have begun training 20,000 Spaniards, who could replace the Italian and German volunteers if the countries agree to withdraw their volunteers. Officials strongly claim that neither of the above two reports could be confirmed, but believe that if they are true, they are part of the rebel army's plan to cut off the connection between Madrid and Valencia. It is reported that because of the complexity of the international situation, Britain is eager to improve its relations with the Spanish National Army. Spanish Fascist leader Robles is currently serving as a representative of the rebel army, and also represents Portugal. If Britain reaches any agreement with the rebel army, Portugal can also participate. (National News, 22nd)

[London] A British government spokesperson told the House of Commons today that the expansion and improvement of the Gibraltar fortress began in 1934 and is still ongoing. He also said that, in the public interest, it is not appropriate to disclose the details and costs of this modernization plan. (Haitong News, 22nd)

### Britain Proposes a Questionnaire to Break the Deadlock on Non-Intervention

Endless Debate on Procedural Matters of Compromise Proposals; Requesting Clear Expressions from All Related Countries

[London] The subcommittee under the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War previously appointed a technical committee to draft methods for monitoring Spanish ports. The said committee convened at 11:00 AM today, with secretaries and naval attachés from the embassies of all related countries in attendance. According to well-informed British sources, British experts have decided to request that all related countries submit written opinions within three days, expressing themselves clearly. This is to prevent these countries from using procedural debates to endlessly delay stating their true intentions. Britain may also present a questionnaire to the related countries, requesting responses by Monday or Tuesday of next week. This questionnaire is expected to include six or seven questions. Once France's views are clearly understood, a decision will be made today. It is reported that Italy is still using all diplomatic means to avoid the responsibility of failed negotiations. (Havas Agency, 23rd)

[London] Regarding the discussion process for various proposals concerning the non-intervention issue in the Spanish conflict, it is heard that the British government has now drafted a brand-new plan. However, they do not intend to notify other governments of this plan until the subcommittee convenes. Furthermore, since the subcommittee must first discuss this new plan at its next meeting, the examination of the proposals themselves will inevitably have to be temporarily shelved. It is also heard that the final form of this new plan is still under discussion by the British government authorities, but it is not impossible for it to be submitted to the subcommittee before the end of this week. At the same time, the Italian representative in London stated that Italy has no intention of refusing to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers from Spain. Angelico Grandi, the Italian ambassador, has also declared to the British Foreign Secretary that Italy's attitude is not aimed at shelving the issue. However, the Italian side feels that granting belligerent rights to both sides in the Spanish war would be a way to enhance the monitoring system, so it should be discussed before the issue of volunteer withdrawal. But this view does not completely negate the possibility of compromise. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Pacific Defense Issues

Question Raised in British House of Commons

[London] Member of Parliament Mandel of the Liberal Party raised a question regarding the construction of defensive works on the American-owned Aleutian Islands and the British-owned Hong Kong in the Pacific Ocean. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, gave an immediate reply, stating that the Ogasawara Islands, Amami Ōshima, and the Ryukyu Islands all belong to Japan and are not mandated territories under the League of Nations. Their defensive works were stipulated by Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty, which requires them to be maintained in their original state. This is the same as for the Aleutian Islands and Hong Kong. However, since the Washington Naval Treaty expired on December 31, 1936, the effect of Article 19 has not been extended. The future defense of these islands should be decided by the related countries through appropriate measures, without any further restrictions. As for the islands mandated by the League of Nations to Japan, namely the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, and Mariana Islands, they are still subject to the restrictions contained in the mandate system and may not build naval or military bases or construct defensive works. As for the defense issues of the islands belonging to Japan and the United States (i.e., the islands restricted from fortification under Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty), we are not fully aware of future plans. Speaking of Hong Kong, we are only renovating the original defenses, which is permitted under Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty. No other new measures have been decided. (Havas Agency, 23rd)

Consequently, both Czech and Romanian individuals criticized him, leading to his forced dismissal. (National Maritime Telegram, 22nd)

### Changes in Senior Soviet Government Officials

Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Appointed; Mikoyan Succeeds

[Moscow] The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union has decided to appoint Mikoyan, the Commissar of the Food Industry, as the Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Yulkin has been appointed as the Commissar of Soviet State Grain and Livestock Farms. Furthermore, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) has decided to appoint Bulganin as the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR.

### Soviet Purge

Extremely Broad Scope

[Paris] "Le Petit Parisien" correspondent in Moscow, Roussaniani, recently published a lengthy article detailing the Soviet purge and continuing to list the surnames of senior Soviet officials recently condemned. He stated briefly, "For several weeks, the purge carried out by the Soviet authorities has been extremely broad in scope." In the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, following the dismissal of Deputy Commissar Krestinsky, those who have been subsequently dismissed include former Ambassador to Turkey Karakhan (who previously served as Ambassador to China), former Ambassador to Spain Rosenholz, former Ambassador to Afghanistan Stark, Director of the German Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs Stein, and Director of the Administrative Department Sukman. In the People's Commissariat for Health, those dismissed include senior official Kaminsky. In the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade, those included are senior officials Rosenholz and Roganosky. In the People's Commissariat for Agriculture, those included are senior official Tsilko and Deputy Director of the State Farm Affairs Bureau Ostrolovsky. In addition, it is rumored that former Director of the Political Police Department Syrtsov, President of the Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Yaroshevsky, former editor of Pravda and old friend of Lenin Rabinovich, and many scholars are suspected of being counter-revolutionaries. The managers of the National Grand Theater, National Small Theater, and the Art Theater are all in custody. Other senior personnel from the State Bank, various factories, various trade unions, and various economic organizations, regardless of whether they are technical or administrative personnel, who are suspected of being reactionary have been dismissed. Regarding the various republics, People's Commissars of the Russian Republic Derotaite, Chervyakov, Diagov, and Benack, and People's Commissar of Light Industry of the Georgian Republic Ramishvili, and People's Commissars of the Uzbek Republic Gotyaev and Kukunshen have all been dismissed. In the Far East, since the recent two months, more than 214 reactionary elements have been sentenced to death. "The above is a general overview of the Soviet purge. It is to be expected that the reactionary elements, in addition to those who have already been executed, will be investigated and dealt with according to the law." (Havas Agency, 23rd)

### US Judicial Reform Plan Dies

Senate Orders Judiciary Committee to Draft New Bill; Major Blow to President Roosevelt

[Washington] President Roosevelt's Supreme Court reform bill died today because the Senate recently voted 70 to 20 to refer the bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instructing it to prepare a new proposal. Before the Senate vote, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a meeting. Vice President Garner acknowledged that the Supreme Court reform case was no longer an issue, but asked the committee to mediate the dispute with sincere words and tears in his eyes. Therefore, the Judiciary Committee agreed to request that the case be returned to the committee, so that a new method of dealing specifically with the problems of the lower courts could be drafted within ten days. It is heard that the new plan drafted by the Judiciary Committee will include cases involving constitutional law being able to be directly appealed to the Supreme Court, and the appointment of lower court judges not being limited by the age of existing judges. (Reuters, 22nd)

[Washington] Regarding the judicial reform bill proposed by President Roosevelt, the Senate recently overturned the amendments passed by the Judiciary Committee. This is the first major political blow to President Roosevelt since he was re-elected last November. The reason is that this amendment does not mention the Supreme Court at all, but only stipulates the issue of the advancement and retreat of judges in the lower courts, and advocates that the president should only select successors when judges leave office, rather than using age as a standard for retirement. This attitude of the Senate has shocked my political faction, who deeply believe that the Supreme Court will continue to obstruct the president's various plans to improve the economic structure and improve the lives of workers. (Havas Agency, 22nd)

### US Farmers Borrow Money at Low Interest to Purchase Land

Both Houses Pass Bill; Presidential Veto Ineffective

⊙Washington Regarding the law that allows farmers to borrow money to buy land and reduces interest rates, both houses of Congress recently passed a bill to extend the effective period for one year. However, President Roosevelt vetoed it because it would increase the next budget expenditure by $30 million. The House of Representatives specifically proposed a review of the bill on the 13th of this month, and still maintained the original plan with a majority of 260 votes to 97 votes. The Senate also maintained the original plan with a majority of 71 votes to 19 votes today. Both houses passed it again with more than two-thirds of the votes, so the presidential veto was ineffective, and the new law was established. (Havas Agency, 21st)

### US Government Gold Reserves Decrease

The remaining balance is $1,170,821,774. It is understood that this is the result of the currency agreements concluded between the United States and China and Brazil. (National Telegram, 22nd)

### Marconi's Remains Buried

Solemn Ceremony

⊙Bologna The funeral of Marconi, the great inventor of wireless telegraphy, was held here today. The ceremony was very solemn. In the morning, 200,000 people gathered on the streets and corners to watch the funeral procession. The procession proceeded from the station to the Basilica of San Petronio. After a special train from Rome arrived here, the Civil Administrator of Rome officially handed over Marconi's remains to the local governor of Bologna. Then the army fired a salute to pay tribute, and Archbishop Soga blessed the remains. The vehicles then set off towards the Basilica, with Marconi's wife and daughter following in the vehicle. The Duke of Genoa represented the King of Italy, and the Minister of Education represented the Italian government, also holding wreaths behind the vehicle. The remains were then buried in the Marconi family's cemetery. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Wu Dingchang Discusses Adequate Grain Reserves in Various Regions

[Nanjing] Minister of Industry Wu issued a statement on the grain issue, stating that in the past, whenever something happened, a few merchants in various cities would take the opportunity to create rumors in an attempt to make huge profits. Citizens did not investigate and were often alarmed. This kind of phenomenon has become a habit. This time, after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the national public was very calm because of the good harvests of last year, and there was no problem with their lives. However, a city or two still had doubts about the grain issue. This is because they did not understand the current situation of grain supply and demand and were deceived by rumors spread by a few people. I cannot but clearly inform you of the facts. Rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains were all harvested well last year. The output of Hsien and Keng rice increased from 87,050,700 shih tan (a unit of dry measure) in the previous year to 87,100,020 shih tan, an increase of 465,000 shih tan. The output of wheat increased from 42,605,200 shih tan in the previous year to 46,150,500 shih tan, an increase of 2,550,300 shih tan. The fact that the original rice and wheat were more than in previous years has already become a fact. (At least an average of two shih tan of grain and rice and one shih tan of wheat or more can be allocated to each person, regardless of age or gender, and miscellaneous grains are not included.) Now that the autumn harvest is very near, there are still quite a lot of food reserves. I will also list the average market prices of rice-producing areas in the past week as proof. I hope that the authorities in major cities should, first, explain the actual situation of grain supply and demand at any time and prohibit rumors; third, there is currently no need to use manpower to restrict the sale of grain; second, the governments of major cities should establish grain transportation and marketing agencies. If the people transport and sell themselves, and they do not have enough capacity, they can entrust this agency to handle it at any time. If the local agencies do not have enough capacity, they can entrust the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau to assist them. In areas outside of cities, because the stock of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains is quite large, there is no problem at all, and there is no need to pay attention. (Special dispatch, 23rd)

Any payments that have not been offset should also be submitted to the Ministry for offsetting and transferred to the treasury accounts in accordance with the prescribed procedures, so as to facilitate the closing of accounts. As for the income tax for fiscal year 25, which has received more than 5.7 million yuan, exceeding the budgeted amount by more than 700,000 yuan, since the tax revenue is collected by the bank on behalf of the government and remitted to the national treasury as it is collected, it has in fact already been closed at the end of the year, so it is not included in this collection call.

### The Activities of Japanese and Taiwanese Residents in Xiamen

Commander Okuma Stationed in Xiamen Commands Fleets in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou; Taiwanese Residents Request the Japanese Consul to Order Marines to Land; Provincial Government Orders All Agencies to Actively Protect Overseas Chinese

Xiamen Correspondence: The Lugouqiao Incident has caused great tension. The activities of Japanese and Taiwanese residents in Fujian Province are particularly noteworthy. A brief record is as follows: ① Commander Okuma of the Japanese Fifth Squadron arrived in Xiamen on the 9th aboard the flagship Yubari, and remained in Xiamen until the 20th. Following Gulangyu, the two Japanese warships Asagao and Asakaze, newly arrived in Fuzhou, separated at Qingwangu Bay on the 18th. However, the warship Hatakaze arrived in Fuzhou on the 19th. Currently, all Japanese warships in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou are under the警戒 of the Fifth Squadron, with Okuma commanding from Xiamen. ② At 6:00 PM on the 18th, eight foreigners arrived by motorboat at Elephant Nose Peak Mountain in Songyu County (the starting point of the Zhangzhou-Songyu Road) across from Xiamen. Six of them, carrying cameras and other equipment, landed to survey and photograph the mountain. This was discovered by the local militia, who immediately reported to the stationed troops there. Several warning shots were fired, and the foreigners hastily got into their car and fled. That evening, Songyu was placed under special curfew. ③ Jinmen County is an island outside Xiamen Port. At 2:00 PM on the 18th, a strange plane flew from northwest to southeast over the county seat, flying very high and unidentifiable by color. ④ Taiwanese residents in Xiamen have been daily submitting requests to the Japanese consul, asking for a large military force and warships to be sent to Xiamen, and for marines to be landed to protect overseas residents. They also requested permission to organize a plainclothes volunteer corps. The Japanese consul replied that the time was not yet ripe. On the night of the 20th, the Taiwanese residents held meetings in three locations. The Japanese consulate sent Japanese police officers to the scene. ⑤ A certain authority sent residents Chen and Zheng to Zhangzhou and Quanzhou to gather military intelligence. Both are intellectual professionals. Chen had previously served as a staff member in a Zhangzhou agency, and Zheng was previously involved in the handling of unclaimed goods in Quanzhou. People in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou rarely recognize them as Taiwanese residents. ⑥ The towns in the third district of Jinjiang County outside the south gate of Quanzhou are coastal areas and have long been a base for activities of Taiwanese residents of a certain party. On the 15th, three drifters came from Xiamen to Shishi and stayed at the home of a Mr. Zeng. The next day, they summoned five doctors surnamed Cai, who are Taiwanese residents in Quanzhou, for a very secretive meeting.

To actively protect overseas residents, the provincial government, on the 19th, ordered the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and the Xiamen Municipal Government to re-investigate in detail the number and occupational status of Japanese and Taiwanese residents in Fuzhou and Xiamen. Those who meet the qualifications after verification with the Japanese consulate will be given strict protection. Xiamen Mayor Li Shilin flew back to Xiamen from the province on the 20th and immediately summoned all police chiefs to strictly protect foreigners. There are very few Japanese residents in Fuzhou and Xiamen, about 300 in each. There are fewer than 1,000 registered Taiwanese residents in Fuzhou, and over 9,000 in Xiamen, with an estimated 18,000 unregistered. The Heshan Special District Office (i.e., all of Xiamen outside the Xiamen urban area) has also received provincial orders to re-register in detail the household registration of foreigners, all to prevent future troubles.

Due to the impact of the Lugouqiao Incident, in addition to public prices fluctuating with the Shanghai market, the prices of various Japanese goods have increased. From July 8th to 19th, within ten days, rice increased by 6.5 to 7 jiao per hundred market pounds, beans increased by 1.5 to 4 jiao, soybean oil increased by 1.4 yuan, and flour increased from 4.4 yuan to 5.2 yuan per bag (July 21st).

### The Sandbags on the Streets Have Been Removed

Beiping Correspondence: Last night, I heard from an American priest at Fu Jen Catholic University that the American consulate had said tomorrow (the 20th) is a crucial moment. However, for over ten days, I have developed a habit of not easily believing things. On the 15th, I heard that the enemy was fiercely attacking. On the 17th, I heard that the enemy had issued an ultimatum, demanding the army withdraw within 24 hours, but war has not yet broken out. The situation is consistently depressing. Some time ago, there was a rumor that a certain railway bureau director had been detained. Yesterday, there was another rumor that a certain mayor's residence had been bombed. None of these have been verified. It only shows where the people's hearts lie. In fact, these two important figures are the most powerful elements working for peace.

I have been running around inside the city for a week. Today (the 19th), I wanted to go outside the city to take a look. I went out at 10:30 AM. Xizhimen was still only half-open, with many sandbags piled up beside it. After the curfew at night, this sandbag surface would be full of the 29th Army brothers, standing ready to fire. The suburban avenues were still peaceful. I only saw a few people moving into the city. When I got to Tsinghua Garden, I heard that there had been shooting and shelling all night yesterday west of the school, because plainclothes troops were causing trouble in Hongshankou, west of the Xiyuan barracks. The school was generally quiet, but some people were leaving the school with luggage. Because I wanted to pay attention to every minute of the development of the incident in Beiping, I was afraid of being trapped outside the city and not being able to participate in the great scene, so after lunch, I took the 1:00 PM bus back to the city.

The school bus passed Xisi Pailou. The 29th Army soldiers beside it were moving sandbags. Since the shelling at Lugouqiao, sandbags had been piled up at each city gate and each important street intersection in Beiping. For ten days, the sandbags had been increasing. From initially arranging a row of sandbags, only able to lie down behind them, bag after bag was added, gradually allowing kneeling fire and providing cover for machine guns, to now allowing standing fire behind them, with wide and deep trenches dug beside them. I watched the 29th Army brothers working hard there, wearing only white shirts, and a feeling of gratitude welled up in my heart. I thought about how a few friends had volunteered to help them stack the sandbags higher the day before yesterday and yesterday, and I said to the classmate in the same car, "We should go down and help them. This can give them considerable encouragement." As I was saying this, the school bus had already driven past.

I got off the bus and walked to the intelligence department of the All-Circles People's Anti-Enemy Support Association. A friend greeted me with a sigh, "The news is bad."

"Is the enemy launching a general attack tomorrow?" I thought of the news I had heard yesterday. Unexpectedly, the reply I received was, "That would be great. The news is that we have accepted the conditions. The sandbags on the streets have all been removed."

I told them not to believe it easily, because I had just seen them seeming to be adding sandbags on the street. But another person said that he had just ridden his bike to the main streets in the eastern and western parts of the city and that they were indeed being removed. I had no choice but to admit that I had overlooked it. Several people were grumbling and angry in the courtyard. The intelligence in the room still had to be sent out: "Peace, or humiliation?" in large characters. Below it was, "Rumors of the Sino-Japanese Agreement Being Signed in Tianjin"... "Sandbags on the Streets of Beiping Are Being Removed..." For the past few days, professors had been working together in the support association, hot and busy, but now they had been doused with cold water.

"Chairman Song has returned to Beiping. He passed by Fengtai. The Japanese soldiers even saluted him. When he arrived in Beiping, he denied that he had signed anything," someone reported.

"Perhaps he will still deny it," another person continued. "People on the street saw the sandbags being removed and all said 'It's over.' But their tones were different. Some were heartbroken, and some were relieved."

"We have been busy for several days. We definitely won't be allowed to do this again," a third person predicted. "What about the 29th Army brothers? They have chopped down enemies and been wounded, piled up sandbags and stood guard. Now they have to tear it all down themselves and have to withdraw from the city of Beiping. How can they endure this?"

I thought of the countless wounded soldiers in the Weishu Hospital, especially the two 29th Army soldiers around seventeen years old. They were groaning and moaning while telling us how they used their "broadswords" to chop off many heads, how happy and satisfying it was. There was also that platoon leader at Fuchengmen, who puffed out his chest and lectured us, "We soldiers are willing to go to the front line and risk our lives. We hope that you all will take care of things in the rear." He was so spirited, so proud of what he said. But now I can't bear to think about their heroic resistance, their heroic sacrifices, and their excited appearance.

Walking out of the support association, I sat in a rickshaw and thought, "For more than ten days, I gave up writing and disrupted my daily life. Now it's back to normal. We still have to endure this and turn this anger into accumulated strength, waiting for a more violent eruption. Before my eyes, I still have to pick up the pen and first report these events, paying tribute to the 29th Army brothers who died for the nation."

Passing by Xisi Pailou, the sandbags were indeed removed. Cleaners were sweeping the ash and dirt on the side of the street with bamboo strips.

But in front of the Beining Railway Business Office and the China Travel Service, there were still large piles of suitcases and trunks being loaded. I thought, "They heard the news. Are they heartbroken or happy?" (July 19th afternoon)

### Suzhou

### Hangzhou

Various Counties Prepare to Raise Autumn Silkworms

Due to the climate this year in Zhejiang Province, the spring and summer silkworm seasons in various counties were not good, and the silk cocoon collections were poor. In order to remedy the rural economy, the Provincial Authorities are massively promoting autumn silkworms. They have separately ordered 550,000 improved silkworm egg sheets from various silk farms in Jiangsu Province, and 840,000 sheets will be supplied by various farms in Zhejiang Province, to be distributed to various counties in the silkworm-raising areas. Because the autumn silkworm season is about to begin, the 500 supervisors from the various improvement zones have been hired, and they are scheduled to depart for work on August 1st. There are only about 10,000 dan of summer rain pasture altogether, and the collection office will be completely closed at the end of the month. The provincial expenses and affairs will be handled concurrently by the improvement zone.

### Wuxi

Strenuously Arguing Against the Wheat Business Tax

The Wuxi Business Tax Bureau recently received orders to investigate the flour mills and collect a temporary business tax on wheat from the grain dealers on behalf of the brokers. The Chamber of Commerce sent letters to Tong Ru Mao Xin, Jiu Feng, Guang Feng, and various flour mills, as well as wheat dealers stationed in Wuxi from other places, to discuss the matter at the Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning. At that time, the Suzhou Taihe Flour Mill was reporting the shipment of wheat, but the Business Tax Bureau did not issue a tax-exempt passport because it did not have the procedure for collecting the temporary business tax on its behalf, resulting in the suspension of transport. The factories were all extremely indignant, and unanimously decided to telegraph the ministry to strenuously argue against the tax, and to hire lawyers to prepare to sue according to the law.

Two Bizarre Murder Cases

Behind Rongxiang Town in the fourth district of the county, there is a Lotus Mountain. The graves on the mountain are numerous, and it is rarely visited. At the foot of the mountain is a village called Gongxiang, belonging to the Da Chi township in the fourth district. Zhang Hairong, a resident of the village, often had the grass and trees on his graves cut down by others, so he ordered his eight-year-old niece, Xiuzhen, to watch over them. At 5:00 PM on the 21st, Xiuzhen went up the mountain again, but when she passed behind the ancestral grave of Yu Peigen halfway up the mountain, she suddenly discovered a corpse lying in the weeds. She was so frightened that she ran wildly down the mountain and told the villagers. The corpse was tall and burly, wearing a white-collared western shirt on its upper body, yellow khaki western pants on its lower body, gray socks on its feet, and round-toed black cloth-soled leather shoes. A soft-brimmed straw hat was left beside the body. The face was rotten and blurred and unrecognizable. The back of the head had been eaten by wild animals. Judging from the situation, the corpse had been lying there for a week. On the 22nd, the heads of the twenty-third and sixth tus of the area, Han Rongsheng and Ding Jinfu, reported to the court, requesting an autopsy. Also, the male corpse on the first branch road of Zhoushanbang, named Dai A’de, was an employee of the Youyi Printing House. There were wounds on the neck and serious injuries on the chest and abdomen. It was indeed a bizarre murder case. The murderer was definitely not one person. The court has already verified the facts and has begun an investigation to arrest the murderer according to the law.

### Zhenjiang

Tao Xiaodong Establishes a Women's Vocational School

Ms. Tao Xiaodong is extremely enthusiastic about the women's movement.

It is divided into four departments: archives, commerce, crafts, and general studies. The Chen family building at No. 4 Yicheng Lane on Dashikou Road is temporarily used as the school building. Yang Shuwang (wife of Director Zhou), Li Songhu (wife of Director Zhao), Wang Huangying (wife of the director of the provincial hospital), Leng Yuqiu, Ye Xiufeng, Jiang Wenyu, Wu Yun’er, Lin Kanghou, Yang Weiyu, Pan Yangyao, and others have been hired as school board members, and preparations have been completed. Enrollment has officially begun, and many women from all walks of life have come to register in recent days.

### Changshu

Fruit Disturbance Occurs

The local police station, for the sake of public health in the summer and the health of the people, has appointed health police to specifically inspect various food stores. According to reports from various fruit shops to the guild, the health police arbitrarily find fault. For any fruit that has even a slight blemish, they immediately detain and fine the people involved, causing both mental and material sacrifice. They convened a meeting of the same industry to dare to petition the county party headquarters for relief. If this is not successful, the entire industry will close down to avoid accidental losses, which is a very serious situation. On the 23rd, the police station convened a meeting of the town chiefs in the city and countryside to report on the progress of the sanitary inspection. It is hoped that persuasion from all sides will prevent the situation from escalating.

### Nantong

Commemorating National Heroes

### Baoshan

Planning to Establish a Cotton Weaving Factory

He will purchase machinery in the near future, and once it arrives, he will install it and start work on schedule.

### Ningbo

Intensifying the Urging of Accumulated Grain Collection

Deng County's landlords, homeowners, merchants, and other accumulated grain owed from the twenty-fifth year, as well as the accumulated grain of wealthy households about to be levied, are all to be collected. The previous provincial order to revise the standards for collecting accumulated grain refers to the accumulated grain to be collected from July of the twenty-sixth year to June of the twenty-seventh year. Therefore, the amount for the twenty-fifth year should still be collected according to the original amount. The county government, fearing that the payers would misunderstand the year and use the already-lowered collection standards as an excuse, ordered the authorities to intensify collection and explain to the payers to avoid misunderstanding.

### Haizhou

Traitors Buy Up Copper Coins

Recently, it has been discovered in Jiaoshuikou Town, Guanyun County, that traitors have been entrusted by a certain party to secretly buy up small copper coins worth ten cash each, pack them into bags, and transport them by boat to Qingdao. Currently, various small shops in the town lack small copper coins for change, which is quite inconvenient.

### Xiaoshan

Occurrence of Cholera

Xu Jixiang, a farmer in Longshan Middle Street Alley in Xiaoshan, suddenly suffered from cholera on the morning of the 20th, with vomiting and diarrhea. Dr. Mao Zaimin from Dongxiang Hospital rushed to treat him, but he was on the verge of death and seemed difficult to save.

### Jiangyin

### Jiashan

Arrested Traitor Escorted to County

Wu Wengou, the captain of the police brigade of the county government, has been working hard to investigate and arrest traitors in recent days.

Suspicious items were found on him, and he was escorted to the county for detention.

Concealing Smuggled Opium Reported

Wu Zhu, a resident of Xiangtai Sheng Sauce Garden on Lower West Street, Fengjing, Jiashan, was previously reported by 保长 Shen Xinyuan for selling opium with his son-in-law. The Public Security Bureau dispatched police to arrest them, seizing more than 100 yong of opium and arresting Wu Zhu and his son-in-law. However, only 30 liang of opium were handed over to the county. Locals believed that concealing opium was a crime and reported it to the provincial government, which has sent personnel twice to investigate in detail.

### Hefei

Adding a Branch Line to the Pu Xin Road

The Jinpu Railway Survey Team has been surveying the Puqin Road in Hefei since January, and their work has been quite fast. However, they have now received an order from the Ministry of Railways stating that, in addition to repairing the Puqin Road, it has also been decided to add a branch line to the Puxin Road to facilitate transportation. They are also to survey this line to facilitate progress. After surveying the area, the team determined that the Puxin branch line passes through the boundaries of Fei County, including Lan'ganji, Wenji, Shitangqiao, and Dianbu. It was decided to set up stakes along the line within days to serve as measurement standards, and the two county governments were instructed to order the twenty-sixth district to take extra care to protect them.

### Funing

Confiscated Smuggled Wheat Boats

For several days, boat prices in the county have been soaring due to merchants smuggling goods out of the area. County Magistrate Zheng Shuxian, realizing this, issued a strict prohibition. Yesterday, the Goudun Police Station confiscated ten boats that were smuggling wheat, and sent the boat owners Yao Guangyou, Yan Dezhao, Mao Xueliang, Zheng Bingchen, Zeng Guangdao, Shi Shande, Zhang Baoguo, and others to the county government for interrogation.

### Xiang Songpo and Others Telegraph Chiang and Song, Volunteering to Fight the Enemy

Li Ling Also Went to Beijing to Petition

Mr. Xiang Songpo, a revolutionary pioneer, is extremely indignant about the rampant actions of the Japanese. In the past two days, he telegraphed Chiang and Song separately, saying: ① To Chairman Song in Beiping and all the soldiers of the 29th Army, We salute you. The Japanese army is tyrannical, provoking attacks, humiliating our national rights, and seizing our territory. What sentient being can endure this? Your resistance is courageous and inspiring, and worthy of the heroes of our nation. Now the government has a firm attitude, and the people are united as one. The morale of the front line is even more elevated, and the survival of the nation is at stake. Having retreated into obscurity on the Shanghai waterfront, I am still willing to follow the spirit of the Premier's overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and restoring the Ming Dynasty, leading the able-bodied men in the country who have always taken safeguarding the nation as their duty, and volunteering to the government to rise up and deal with them. I am willing to sacrifice myself. I respectfully express my feelings to encourage each other. Xiang Haiqian bows in reverence. ② To Chairman Chiang in Nanjing, I salute you. The tyranny of the Japanese is shocking the world. Reading Your Excellency's announcement of the Four Principles, with the determination to sacrifice to the end as a guarantee for the survival of the nation, your words are stern and your righteousness is just, and both China and foreign countries are drinking from it. Although I am not talented, I believe that as an outsider, I can lead the able-bodied men in the country to fight to the death with the brutal invaders. As long as there is one breath left, I will have no concern. I am grief-stricken and awaiting orders. I respectfully express my feelings. Xiang Haiqian bows in reverence.

Also, Mr. Li Ling, director of the Shanghai China Detective Agency, recently, in light of the serious national crisis, went to Beijing today to volunteer to the authorities to fight against the enemy. According to Li, at this critical juncture of life and death, our people can no longer afford to wait and see. We must destroy our homes to relieve the national crisis, and be prepared to be the government's rearguard, in order to fulfill our duties as citizens.

### Business Leaders in Metal Industry Decide to Prevent

Outward Transport of Scrap Iron

Several trade associations in this city's metal industry, including the metal scrap industry and the metal parts industry, have noted that since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, unscrupulous individuals in this city have begun secretly collecting scrap iron for outward transport. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a joint meeting was held on the third floor of the City Commerce Bureau to discuss preventative measures. After representatives from each association presented the advantages and disadvantages, and contributed their opinions, a decision was made on measures to be implemented after approval from the City Social Affairs Bureau, effective immediately.

### Overseas Chinese Federation Sends Telegram to Overseas Chinese, Urging Joint Effort in National Crisis

The Overseas Chinese Federation, in order to jointly face the national crisis, sent a telegram by express mail to returned overseas Chinese nationwide, stating that since the September 18th Incident, six years have passed. The military and civilians nationwide have been cultivating national strength and seeking peace, not hesitating to endure humiliation and burden and turning blood into tears. However, the nation's land is finite, while the enemy's ambition is insatiable. The violent Japanese have already forcibly occupied the four northeastern provinces, creating a puppet state in the past, and then invaded eastern Hebei and northern Chahar, disrupting the hinterland. Today, they launched the Lugouqiao Incident, attempting to sweep across North China in one fell swoop, in order to fulfill their dream of conquering China and dominating East Asia. Today's event, as Chairman Chiang has pointed out, has reached the final critical moment for the nation's survival. All citizens with life and spirit must mobilize and engage in resistance under the leadership of the government and great leaders, defending the homeland and recovering lost territories. However, unity in action is paramount, and strength can only be concentrated through concerted effort. The Federation believes that overseas Chinese have always been known for their patriotic fervor, and the comrades in returning overseas Chinese groups have made special contributions to the nation. Now, it is planned to start with overseas Chinese groups in various domestic regions, thoroughly connect and solicit opinions, in order to achieve unified national salvation. If you agree, please reply immediately. We eagerly await your response. The Overseas Chinese Federation.

### An Open Letter to Women from the China Women's Support Association

The enemy's bayonets are pointed at our hearts; let us join our male compatriots in shouldering the responsibility of national salvation. The China Women's Anti-Japanese Support Association, initiated and organized by He Xiangning, held its inaugural meeting at He's residence at 4:00 PM on the 22nd. The wives of Sun Song Qingling, Kong Xiangxi, Cai Yuanpei, and Yu Hongjun were invited to serve as directors, and personnel were assigned to various groups such as general affairs,慰劳, recruitment, and rescue, and will begin active work immediately. It was also decided to expand and establish branches throughout the country. The Association specifically issued an open letter to women nationwide yesterday, the original text of which is as follows: Since the "September 18th" Incident, the enemy, like wolves and tigers, has occupied our four northeastern provinces and invaded and disrupted our North China. This time, the provocative and violent act at Lugouqiao has especially aroused the indignation of our entire nation. Everyone is thinking of rushing to the front lines to resist the war. We all feel that our years of enduring humiliation and seeking peace have only emboldened the enemy to become even more reckless and rampant. They neither respect international conventions nor disregard our national sovereignty. What diplomacy is there to speak of? Now is the final moment for our nation to fight for survival. Only national unity and resistance against the enemy is our only way out. Chairman Chiang's recent declaration of four points is precisely the common aspiration of our country, both government and public. All our compatriots, men and women, are willing to shed our last drop of blood rather than see our nation perish and become slaves to a foreign power. However, resisting the enemy is the responsibility of our entire nation. Our young and strong women compatriots can naturally also bravely go to the front lines and take up arms to fight. However, generally speaking, for our sisters, everyone can do something for support work, such as rescue,慰劳, and so on. Now that the war is about to begin, and in such hot weather, the heroic soldiers on the front lines are bathed in blood in the trenches, and the disaster victims in the war zone are under enemy fire, with no homes to return to. Please think about it, who doesn't have brothers and sisters? Who doesn't have parents and children? The enemy's bullets and bayonets, who dares to guarantee that they can escape? Therefore, we specifically initiate and organize the "China Women's Anti-Japanese Support Association" to join our male compatriots in facing the national crisis and mobilizing organizations throughout the country, shouting loudly: Now is the final moment for our nation to fight for survival. Sisters who unanimously do not want to be slaves to a foreign country, please get up quickly. Those who have strength contribute their strength, those who have money contribute their money, those who can go to the battlefield go to the battlefield, and those who can rescue and慰劳 come out to do rescue and慰劳 work. The enemy's guns are already aimed at our hearts. The enemy's knives are already raised at our necks. We cannot seek to survive by luck, nor can we seek to preserve ourselves partially. Going forward is our only way out. We can only unite to resist the war, resist the war, resist the war! Patriotic women compatriots, please get up quickly!

### Actively Carrying Out Emergency Rescue in Times of Emergency

Liu Ruiheng Convenes Leaders from All Walks of Life to Discuss Measures; Requests 200,000 from Song Ziwen for Emergency Use

Leaders from all walks of life Organize Emergency Rescue. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the National Government's Department of Health, came to Shanghai from Beijing on the 21st due to the tense war situation in North China. That evening, at the International Hotel, he invited more than 20 leaders from the city's medical, pharmaceutical, and financial sectors, including Wang Xiaolai, Wen Lantao, Lu Bohong, Yan Fuqing, and Li Ting'an, to discuss the organization of emergency rescue measures during times of emergency. According to Liu, under the current tense situation on the front lines in North China, there is an urgent need for preparations for emergency rescue. Therefore, all regions should promptly find ways to establish emergency rescue organizations, and maintain close contact with local Red Cross societies and local health agencies to prepare for the arrival of times of emergency. At present, it is particularly necessary to urgently carry out emergency rescue for soldiers on the front lines in North China, because we cannot sit idly by and watch the lives of heroic soldiers who have sacrificed for the country perish when medical efficacy can save them, and so on. Subsequently, other attendees expressed their opinions on the preparations for engaging in emergency rescue, and all expressed their agreement in principle. It was decided to formally discuss the progress in the near future. It is also learned that Liu's visit was motivated by the lack of rescue supplies in our country, so he has consulted with Song Ziwen to find a way to allocate 200,000 to purchase medicines, gauze, cloth, bandages, rubber plasters, and other items to meet needs.

Women Pay Attention to Air Defense and Rescue

The Shanghai Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association believes that people should have various preparations for emergency situations, and that air defense and rescue work are extremely important. It deeply feels the lack of knowledge of women in air defense and rescue, so the board of directors decided to establish a rescue class to teach battlefield rescue and simple treatment methods free of charge. Anyone interested in or enthusiastic about rescue work is welcome to enroll. Registration begins today at the Public Education Center and Renhe Hospital on Molly Avenue. Classes are scheduled to officially begin on August 15th. It is stipulated that every week from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, battlefield rescue bandage science and first aid general treatment methods will be taught. From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, knowledge of air defense and anti-poisoning will be taught. The course is scheduled to graduate in three months. According to the person in charge of the association, in this time of national crisis, everyone has the duty to serve the country, and our female compatriots should also rise up to save the country, and it is especially appropriate to take on rescue work. It is also learned that the Shanghai Women's Promotion Association is now initiating the organization of rescue teams, with 21 people per team. When each team is fully staffed, a doctor will lead the team to stand by for departure.

Red Swastika Society Work Report

The Lugouqiao Incident in Pingxi occurred. The World Red Swastika Society Rescue Team has already dispatched a team to the war zone for relief. The previous report has been recorded. It is now heard that the Shanghai General Office of the Association has sent a letter reporting the work situation of the team, saying: Since the team set out to the war zone to implement relief, the average number of soldiers and civilians treated daily is more than 256, and 5,000 doses of summer medicine are distributed daily, which is not enough. On the 13th, the team departed from Chechengmen and detoured through Bali Village, Agricultural College, Madaomiao, Hetaoyuan, Zaolin Village, and Siqingdi villages to Wanping County. A total of 112 injured and sick soldiers and civilians were treated outside the west gate. In addition, the poor people in the county city and surrounding areas were unable to make a living due to the incident. The team, together with the village chiefs, provided emergency relief to more than 160 people. On the 14th and 15th, team members were dispatched to various important urban areas for patrols and treatment, and summer medicine was distributed. Subsequent work situations will be reported in due course.

Disaster Relief Association Trains Rescuers

In order to comprehensively discuss the relief of war-zone refugees, the Joint Relief and Disaster Relief Association of Charitable Organizations established a design committee the other day to be responsible for planning and carrying out related matters. It is now learned that the association believes that the training of rescue personnel is the first priority for rescuing refugees. Therefore, it plans to consult with the Buddhist Association to quickly prepare 50 people under the age of 20 to 40 to engage in training, and it has been decided to use the Poor Children's Hospital as the training location.

### Famous American Educator Talks About the North China Incident

The Activities of the Japanese in North China Arouse Strong Discontent in Western America

The Continental News reports that Mr. Anderson, a famous educator who has served in Shanghai for many years and is now the principal of the American Field-American Guardian College, is in Shanghai for a short summer trip. Dr. Anderson and his wife arrived in Shanghai on Sunday. They originally intended to lead other American travelers on a trip to North China. However, they have now canceled this trip due to the incident in North China and returned to their home country. Dr. and Mrs. Anderson plan to stay in Shanghai for a few days to visit their old friends and are scheduled to leave for the United States on August 2nd. Dr. Anderson has been leading a tour group to China every year since he left Shanghai in 1931. Yesterday, Dr. Anderson told a reporter from the Continental News that the sentiment in Western America is that the Japanese occupation of the Northeast is a fait accompli, but everyone is angry and dissatisfied with the activities of the Japanese in North China. At the same time, they admire the stability of China's internal situation. Americans are now greatly concerned about Chinese affairs. Dr. Anderson is familiar with Far Eastern affairs and gives 30 to 40 lectures on Far Eastern issues in the United States every year. He previously served as a professor in the Department of Education at Shanghai University for eight years, and then as the principal of the American School in Shanghai for six years.

### Jiangsu and Zhejiang Ban the Transport of Dry Cocoons, Causing Panic in Shanghai Silk Factories

The Silk Factory Industry Association Holds a Meeting Yesterday; Decides to Request the Authorities of the Two Provinces to Lift the Ban

Since the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces banned the exit of dry cocoons ordered by various silk factories in Shanghai from the provinces, various silk factories in this city are very panicked. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association and the silk industry unions of the Fourth and Sixth Districts held a joint meeting to negotiate a request to the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to lift the ban, and the Hezhai and Yuanchang factories in Zhabei were shut down due to the exhaustion of raw materials. The details are recorded below.

Stock Only for Two Weeks

The raw materials of various silk factories in this city are all supplied by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The daily demand for dry cocoons is about 600 loads, and although the current stock of dry cocoons in this city varies from factory to factory, the average estimate is only enough for two weeks. Therefore, once Jiangsu and Zhejiang ban the transport of dry cocoons to Shanghai, it will be difficult for various silk factories in this city to last.

Ineffective Negotiation to Prohibit Loading and Transport

According to the statistics, there are the largest number of silk factories in the Zhabei District and Xinzha Road. The total number of silk factories in the city is 44, with about 10,484 silk reeling machines and about 10,000 workers. Since Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces banned the exit of dry cocoons, various silk factories in this city have been extremely panicked. It is also heard that the dry cocoons ordered by a silk factory in Wuxi have also been prohibited from loading and transporting by the authorities of Jiangsu Province. Although negotiations have been conducted, they have not been effective.

Reasons for the Ban in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces

The reasons for the ban on exit from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this time are: First, the output of dry cocoons in the two provinces this year is not large. Whether it is sufficient for the silk factories in the two provinces needs to be investigated in detail before it can be known. In the future, if there is a surplus, it will be allowed to exit. Second, in the past, dry cocoons transported to Shanghai were often resold for export, resulting in a decreasing stock of dry cocoons in the country. In order to maintain the country's silk industry and adjust the domestic supply of silk cocoons, the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have temporarily banned their exit.

Impact: Two Factories Stop Production

It is heard that the Hezhai and Yuanchang silk factories of Gujiawan, Hengbang Road, Zhabei, have little stock. Since Jiangsu and Zhejiang banned the export of cocoons, the source has been cut off. Therefore, they will stop production today. The factory has about 500 workers. Yesterday, the factory authorities specifically notified the Sixth District General Silk Industry Union and the Silk Factory Industry Union.

Joint Meeting Decides to Petition

Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the executive members of the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association, the raw material maintenance committee, and representatives of the silk industry unions of the Sixth and Fourth Districts held a joint meeting at the meeting place of the Silk Factory Industry Association. In addition to reporting the ban on the exit of dry cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the situation of various silk factories in this city, it was also decided to issue a statement and petition the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the municipal government, and the central government to safeguard the silk industry and the livelihoods of workers in this city. The meeting ended at about 8:00 PM.

### Fulunheng Silk Factory Labor Dispute Resolved

Wage Restoration; Resumption of Work Yesterday

The Fulunheng Double Palace Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road, Hongkou, has been open for many years. The manager, Shen Shunpei, has been doing well in recent years. The factory employs more than 300 female workers. Because they requested the restoration of their original wages and the increase of workshop equipment, which was not accepted by the factory, all the workers refused to enter the factory on the 1st of this month, announcing a strike. They reported to the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union and requested that personnel be sent to negotiate. The standing directors of the union, Chen Xiupu and Yang Hongmei, based on the wishes of the workers, made a request to Manager Shen of the factory. After several negotiations, a resolution was reached the other day. The resolution was: (1) The wages of female workers in the first-class workshop will be restored to 47 cents starting from June, and the rest will be done by analogy. (2) Hot water tap equipment will be added to the workshop as needed. (3) Work will be resumed uniformly on the morning of July 23. After the above items were agreed upon by both parties, Chen Xiujin, Yang Hongmei, He Bin, Qu Jimin, and others were sent by the union to lead all the female workers to enter the factory for work resumption uniformly at 5:00 AM today (the 23rd).

### French Gunboat Orphee II Arrives in Shanghai

Since the North China Incident, the situation in this city has suddenly become tense. Various countries have dispatched warships to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the French gunboat "Orphee II" sailed from Changqi to Shanghai and is now berthed on the Bund of Guangdong Road. It forms a Y-shape with the British warship "Falkesto", and the American warship "Sacramento", facing the Peace Statue at the intersection of Edward Road from afar.

### Shanghai Section of the Jin-Hu Railway

Double Track Project Begins

The Ministry of Railways borrowed 800,000 pounds from the China-British Bank as project costs and to purchase locomotives for the laying of double tracks on the Shanghai section of the Jin-Hu Railway. The first phase of 400,000 pounds has been used to order steel rail materials from England. They will be transported to Shanghai in late August. The Ministry of Railways believes that the Liao Project is very important and must be completed immediately, so it has ordered the two railway bureaus to proceed as soon as possible.

### Journalists Association Holds Second Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday

Request Efforts to Rescue Wang Yanshi; Strive for Anti-Japanese Propaganda

The Shanghai Journalists Association held its second Executive Committee meeting at the association's meeting place at 5:30 PM yesterday. The committee members present were Zhu Chaoran, Ma Chonggan, Hang Shijun, Nie Shiqi, Sun Menghua, Sun Run Shen, Zhang Jiping, Wang Wenbin, Feng Youzhen, Shao Xubai, Qu Shaoyi, Xu Chihen (Hang's representative), and Qian Hua. Feng Youzhen was the chairman and Nie Shiqi was the secretary. The resolutions were as follows: (1) Regarding the case of the Tianjin reporter Wang Yanshi being arrested by the Japanese army, and what the association should do, it was resolved to send a telegram to the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee and the Tianjin Municipal Government to find ways to rescue him, and to慰劳Wang's family. (2) Regarding how members of the association should prepare for work in this emergency period, it was resolved that: (a) The association will notify all members to concentrate their efforts and strive for anti-Japanese propaganda. (b) Schedule a current affairs forum, nominate committee members Wang Wenbin, Zhang Jiping, and Qu Shaoyi to prepare for it, and invite committee member Zhang to convene the meeting. (3) Regarding whether the association should hold emergency training and nominate members to study and contact the case, it was resolved that the association should hold it, and committee member Ma Chonggan was nominated to study it.

### Tianjin Stocks of the State-Run China Merchants Bureau are Safe

It has been said that more than 300,000 bags of flour stored in the Tanggu warehouse of the State-Run China Merchants Bureau have been forcibly seized by the Japanese army. According to the person in charge of the bureau, all the flour in the Tianjin bureau's Tanggu warehouse has been transported to Tianjin and is safe. This is specifically recorded.

### Current Situation of Ocean Transportation

Current Tonnage of Ships Exceeds Demand

According to news from the shipping industry, the increase in world sea freight rates has become a universally acknowledged fact. However, according to the London Shipping Association, the current increase is not enough to offset the expenses of sea transportation. The Association's report last year stated that although the activities of the world's shipping industry are sufficient to offset the needs of tonnage, and sea freight rates have almost reached the standard of 1929, the costs of sailing and construction have continued to increase. Therefore, all shipping companies are suffering from irreparable depreciation and expenses. It further proves that the price index from July 1936 to January 1937 shows that ocean freight rates increased by an average of 58%. However, this increase is only half of that in 1920. The recent surge in the steel market is the main reason for the increase in sea freight rates. Because the demand for steel in countries such as Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Japan is endless, even in the summer months, there have long been concerns about the supply of steel, and the price has soared. The cost of ships, which use steel as their bones, has also increased exponentially. Even scrap steel has encountered the same impact. However, on the one hand, China's current tonnage is insufficient, and shipping companies have long been concerned about the difficulty of supplying enough ships. Recently, many ships have moved their business elsewhere in order to obtain higher profits, and the remaining ships are even more insufficient to meet the needs of freight transport. In summary, those who lease ships are the luckiest and most profitable.

### Yichang Water Level Continues to Rise

48 Feet, 5 Inches

According to a report received by Jianghai Customs yesterday, the water level in Yichang rose from 48 feet and length inches the day before to 49 feet and 3 inches, approaching 50 feet, and the rising trend has not stopped. There is a tendency to break the highest record of 1933, which is extremely worrying. As for the lower reaches of Bai Hankou and below, the water level is still unstable.

### Ch'u Min-i and Others Organize Hsün Society General Assembly Scheduled

10:00 AM on the 25th, Cheng I Society at the Great China Marketplace

### Student Circles Grieved by National Crisis Launch Propaganda Movement

Six Propaganda Guidelines Established

Since the situation in North China has become critical, student circles in this city, grieved by the national crisis, plan to expand the propaganda against buying and selling smuggled goods to awaken citizens to resist foreign aggression and defend against the enemy. They are currently requesting the approval of the Anti-Smuggling Association. The established propaganda guidelines are as follows: ㊀ Smuggling undermines our national industry and commerce, weakens our national strength, and reduces our ability to resist the enemy. On the other hand, smuggling strengthens Japan's aggressive power. ㊁ Smuggling is Japan's economic aggression, while armed invasion is Japan's military aggression. We should resist Japan's military aggression while also reducing Japan's economic aggression. ㊂ To reduce smuggling, we must rely on the public not to buy or sell smuggled goods. On the other hand, we must also defend our territory by force and strictly enforce armed anti-smuggling measures. ㊃ North China is now under Japanese military invasion. This is Japan's plan to annex the entire China. We should resolutely resist. Otherwise, North China will become the second Northeast, and the entire China will be in danger. ㊄ Although Japan's military strength is considered strong, if we can unite and resist, we will have a chance of victory. Our people should now prepare all manpower and resources to support the government's resistance against Japan. ㊅ Japan's manpower and resources are delivered from afar to China. As long as the entire country is united and resolutely resists to the end, the final victory will ultimately belong to us.

### Ma Chan-shan Speaks on Thoughts on the Situation in the North

We must not forget our Northeastern land and compatriots. Now is the time for righteous armies to be active during the green gauze tent season.

Mr. Ma Chan-shan, former Northeastern anti-Japanese general and member of the Military Affairs Commission, recently traveled north, staying in Tianjin for a month, and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically visited his residence yesterday to inquire about his observations and thoughts on the situation in the North. According to him, all officers and soldiers of the 29th Army, especially those from the brigade commander level downwards, are determined to fight to the death and are calmly preparing for war. Outside rumors mislead the public, and some misunderstand Chairman Song. Song's resistance against the enemy at Xifengkou created a glorious page in the history of our nation. He is determined and will not have different thoughts. Song once told me that he would follow the orders of the central government in everything and would never succumb to any conditions from the Japanese. He would never make decisions on his own; otherwise, he would be spurned by the people of the country and not be obeyed by his subordinates. Our people love peace. As the saying goes, "We will not offend others unless we are offended." Now is the critical moment of life and death for our nation. All parties should unite, the country should be unified, and all people, young and old, should know that the national crisis has reached this point. There is only one principle: to follow Chairman Chiang's proposal for resistance. We must not forget our Northeastern land and compatriots. The volunteer armies are still constantly going to the front. According to investigations, the total number is about 50,000 to 60,000, or perhaps more. It is now the green gauze tent season, and it is the time for the righteous armies to be active.

### Verdict Concluded on Appeal of Two Criminals in Assassination of Tang Yu-jen

Both Liu Chen-nan and Ch'iu Chi-yü Recant Their Confessions; Lawyers' Arguments Focus on Physical and Eyewitness Evidence; Sentencing Scheduled for 8:00 AM on the 30th

Tang Yu-jen, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, was shot and assassinated on December 25th of the 24th year of the Republic at around 5:00 PM in Shanghai. He was riding in his personal car and alighting in front of his private residence at No. 235, 20 Village, Gansdon Road in the French Concession when he was suddenly shot and killed by assailants who fled the scene. Criminals Liu Chen-nan from Hubei and Ch'iu Chi-yü from Shaoxing were successively captured by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the Public Concession Police. The French Concession Police took them back for a two-month investigation, which concluded with the Special No. 2 Court's Police Affairs Office filing a public prosecution against them for murder. The Criminal Court President Liao repeatedly conducted court hearings, which concluded with the judgment that both criminals, Liu Chen-nan and Ch'iu Chi-yü, were habitual offenders who committed joint murder and were sentenced to death with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Dissatisfied with the verdict, the criminals presented reasons and hired attorney Hsü Ho-ling as their agent to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Criminal Court Judge Wang Yüeh held an investigatory hearing and scheduled another hearing. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Criminal Court President Wu T'ing-ch'i of the Third Branch of the High Court, accompanied by Judges Ch'en Ta-ch'i and Wang Yüeh, visited the Criminal Court No. 3 to specially convene an en banc hearing. Prosecutor Tung Ch'i-ming also attended to perform his duties. Attorney Shan Fei-hsi of the Police Affairs Office represented the prosecution. Attorney Hsü Ho-ling, the defense attorney for the appellants, also appeared on time. The court ordered that the appellants Liu and Ch'iu be brought before the court. They were first questioned about their age and reasons for the appeal. Liu Chen-nan testified that he had been arrested and imprisoned for a kidnapping case and was released in April of the year before last. Later, he lived with his parents, wife, and children on Roberts Road. On October 10th of last year, Hsü Tzu-mo came to find me. My father called me to meet Hsü in Zhaofeng Garden. After talking, I sent Hsü to the corner of Jiaozhou Road and was arrested by detectives who came towards me. At the Public Security Bureau, I was tortured with the tiger bench until I fainted twice. When I woke up, they told me that the main criminals who killed Tang Yu-jen, Yang Yu-sheng and Ch'iu Chi-yü, had been arrested in Hong Kong and Shanghai and had confessed that I was also involved in the matter. After saying this, they treated me to a meal and then pressed my fingerprints. All the confessions were written by people inside the Public Security Bureau. I did not understand the contents but was told to confess. Now I have been sentenced to death, which is really unjust. I request justice. I have been to the house of Miss Li, Yang Yu-sheng's mistress. I met her in the 25th year of the Republic. After being released from prison, I asked Yang to introduce me to a job. Yang told me to go to Guangdong with Xiao and stay in the YMCA. After meeting Yang, I returned to Shanghai because there was nothing to do. The four hundred yuan mentioned in the original trial was given by Yang to Xiang Xingchang to cover room and board expenses and was not a reward for us. I do not know who rented the house at No. 233 Gansdon Road. Question: You previously confessed that the house was rented by Yang Yu-sheng and Xiao Pei-wei, that you had lived there for two days, and that it was the base for killing Tang Yu-jen. Why are you denying it now? Answer: The Public Security Bureau told me to say that. Ch'iu Chi-yü then testified that he was released from prison on October 24th of the 24th year of the Republic. He met Yang Yu-sheng in prison. Yang was released from prison before me. A few days after I was released, I met Yang Yu-sheng, Xiao Pei-wei, Xiang Xingchang, Li Lan-ting, and Liu Chen-nan at No. 10, Junyi Lane, Beller Road. Yang told me to go and kill Tang Yu-jen. I refused. He said that in Chinese territory, Liu Luyin could guarantee your safety. I still refused. They prevented me from fleeing. On the 28th of that month, they told me to go to Guangdong. Everything I confessed before was extracted under torture and is all false. I request that Liu Wan, Tang's maid Wang A-mei, the butler in the apartment Hsü Wei-chang, and the gatekeeper Tai Chin-piao be summoned to the case for cross-examination. At this point, the court considered the investigation complete and the facts clear. It then ordered the debate to begin. After the attorney for the Police Affairs Office made his arguments, the defense attorney for the appellants argued that the physical evidence in this case, the shell casings from the shooting and the number of shots fired, had not been studied in detail by the original trial. The witnesses were questioned separately in the original trial. They were very clear that there were three people who shot and killed Tang Yu-jen, but they all said they did not know what the criminals looked like, which is obviously contradictory and unacceptable. To make people confess willingly, it is necessary to summon the witnesses again for cross-examination to provide a basis for the verdict. After the arguments were finished, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 8:00 AM on the 30th. The appellants were returned to custody.

### Shao Yue-ju Embezzlement Case Arguments Concluded

Shao Admits to Settlement, But Knows Nothing About the Check

Shao Yue-ju, a shareholder of the Yang Qinghe Jiuji Jewelry Store who had been closed, was recently arrested by the General Police Station for defrauding creditors Shi Yiji, Guo Zhoutao, Kuai Shaoqingzhi, Kang Renchu, and four others of more than 90,000 yuan. He was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and ordered to post 5,000 yuan bail pending further investigation. As reported in this newspaper yesterday morning, the Special Court continued the interrogation. Attorney Jiang Baolian of the Police Station stated the case. Creditors Guo Zhoutao and Shi Yiji then testified. When questioned, the defendant Shao Yue-ju testified that the Yang Qinghe Jiuji Jewelry Store had a total of 16 shares, each worth 2,500 taels of silver. I had four shares. Later, the jewelry store went bankrupt, and the plaintiffs filed a civil lawsuit. I agreed to compensate them for one-fourth, totaling more than 23,000 yuan. Because I was in Qingdao, my second son, Shao Xiaosong, came forward to reach a settlement. Shao Xiaosong then testified that his father was ill and had gone to Qingdao for recuperation, so I came forward to reach a settlement with the plaintiffs. As a result, a settlement was reached at the law office of Attorney Zhang Shizhao, and 23,000 yuan in cash, one-fourth of the amount, was paid. He therefore held a settlement agreement. He did not know anything about the check or the paper. After mutual arguments between defense attorney Fan Gang and Police Station attorney Jiang Baolian, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the morning of the 28th of this month.

Unexpectedly, she developed an illicit relationship with Zhang. Wang Shouchen had heard about it but had no evidence and was reluctant to make it public to save face. Li even used a large sum of money to help Dr. Zhang open the Yongchun Hospital on Beihai Road. Recently, she rented a house at No. 19, Tongfu Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, as a place for secret rendezvous. Wang Shouchen found out and reported it to the General Police Station. On the 19th, at around 1:00 AM, Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng and Western Detective Tierden rushed to arrest them. Li Xiulan and Zhang Boren were arrested in the house and taken back to the police station. After questioning, because both had fixed addresses, they were not detained but ordered to leave. A report was prepared by the detectives and submitted to the First Special District Court to issue a summons for a hearing on a set date.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Sir, We have just received a letter from the Tianjin Fellow Industry Association of Flour and Food Grains in Shanghai, stating that the Shanghai Shin Pao, Shih Shih Hsin Pao and Ta Kung Pao today reported that more than 300,000 bags of flour, worth hundreds of thousands of yuan, had been seized by the Japanese army from the two warehouses of the Tianjin Tanggu Merchants Bureau. We were shocked to read this. After investigating, we found that there were no large quantities of flour stored in Tanggu, and that the Tianjin warehouses were located in the British Concession, so there was no seizure. Furthermore, there was no such thing as the Japanese army forcibly seizing flour. Our fellow industries have daily telegrams and there is no such news. It was also reported that the merchants convened an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss ways to remedy the situation and telegrammed the Hebei-Chahar authorities to request relief, which is even more unfounded. We hereby solemnly declare to your association that we must request that your letter be sent to various newspapers for correction, so as to avoid rumors being spread by unscrupulous people to confuse the public. We sincerely hope that your association will do so. Sincerely, Shanghai Flour Mill Industry Association.

### National Products Manufacturers Association Requests Speedy Establishment of a Special Bureau for the Management of Military Supplies

Presented to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to Prevent Traitors from Buying Supplies to Aid the Enemy

The China National Products Manufacturers Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, requesting unified control of national defense necessities and the establishment of a special management bureau. The original telegram reads: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, according to reports, there are traitors in this city who, disregarding the national entity, are willing to be exploited, purchasing large quantities of grain and national defense necessities for export to the north, transported from Tianjin and Qinhuangdao to areas outside the customs, to supply the enemy's military needs. The association held a temporary emergency meeting on the 18th to discuss the matter. It was unanimously agreed that Shanghai currently lacks a special bureau to strictly manage the export of national defense necessities, leading these treacherous merchants to use the concessions as a shield, disregarding the overall situation and seeking only private gain. It was decided to submit a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to jointly establish a specialized agency with relevant municipal agencies and organizations to be responsible for management. In addition to the association notifying all member manufacturers to register all types of supplies related to national defense, we hereby submit a telegram to your ministries for review and implementation, which would be in the public interest."

### Batavia Basketball Team to Participate in the National Games

Preliminary Selections Decided

(Batavia Correspondence) The second preparatory meeting of the Batavia Basketball Association's Restoration Preparatory Committee addressed the issue of participation in the National Games. In addition to specifying the preliminary list of basketball representatives selected from Batavia, several other proposals were also discussed and resolved.

The meeting stipulated that the number of female basketball players registered was only fourteen, and all were temporarily selected. Due to the lack of formal men's basketball games in the past six months, it was difficult to discern individual skills in just a few tryout matches, so several players were also provisionally selected. Both sides will await several practice sessions for careful observation before announcing the official lineup. The preliminary player selections are: (Female) Li Daosun, Rao Chunmei, Zeng Li, Lin Shiliang, Su Xuechu, Liu Wuliang, Chen Yongxue, Lan Shunliang, Ye Jinliu, Chen Hanliang, Xu Xinlan, Li Shuhuan, Su Yiyi, Miss Tang; (Male) Wen Jingduo, Huang Huabing, Xu Huaneng, Lin Pingyan, Liu Wenxuan, Xu Baolong, Liu Guokang, Zhang Jinyuan, Xiao Feng, Hu XunJin, Tang Chongcui, Huang Wenzhao, Huang Yaohua, Li Kunsheng, Yang Qianliang, Chen Qinghuo. Also, Xu Zhiwen, Chen Yusheng, Li Zhiren, and Wen Yongxin, who have registered but have not yet appeared, may be given a fair opportunity if they can attend practice at least once within the specified time.

The West Java District Qualifying Tournament is scheduled to be held in Batavia on July 10th and 11th. The Batavia side is designated to cover the food and lodging expenses of the athletes from various regions, which will be costly and require immediate fundraising. In addition to inviting Consul Lin, Li Jifu, Chen Longji, Situ Zan, Pan Taisheng, Wang Bingzhi, Chen Xingyan, Hong Yuanyuan, Lin Shuiqing, Yang Xiangzhi, and others to serve as fundraising advisors for the West Java District Basketball Qualifying Tournament, others are also being sought for consent.

### 1937 Wimbledon Tennis Championships (11)

— Our European Correspondent Lieshan

Day Nine

The matches between Buggy, Kramm, Austin, and Parker, the final four in the men's singles, are the most important events of the day. Many people had predicted that the final would be between Buggy and Kramm, so they didn't seem to pay much attention to the other matches. Although Buggy defeated Parker with a score of 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, the tension of the match far exceeded the expectations of the general public. Buggy actually lost a set, which was a first for him in 1937, and Parker was the first person to do so. Parker played brilliantly today. He is truly the second-best player in America. After watching the match, a British journalist sighed, "Britain will not have any hope of regaining the Davis Cup within ten years!" (Both Buggy and Parker are only twenty-one years old this year.) The next day, a Daily Herald reporter said, "If Parker doesn't win the World Championship within two years, I'll eat my hat!" In short, this was the most exciting match of this year's Wimbledon. The United States has at least a 70-80% chance of winning the Davis Cup this year.

▲ Buggy Defeats Parker

People who have watched Buggy play always have the feeling that no matter how fierce the opponent's skills are, he always has confidence and always has the upper hand. When he plays against ordinary second- or third-rate players, he almost always has a "cat playing with a mouse" attitude. But today he was anxious. This was the first time we saw Buggy looking flustered, and he even changed his racket several times.

After the first set started, Buggy still maintained his usual unhurried attitude. It wasn't until Parker took a 4-2 lead that he realized something was wrong, but it was already too late. Parker not only returned Buggy's most powerful weapon, his cannonball serve, but also his "unparalleled" volleying skills. When the ball reached the opponent's court, it was often saved by Parker, which left Buggy helpless. Parker won the first set 6-2.

In the second set, Buggy's carefree smile disappeared. Although Parker still won two games, taking a 2-0 lead, Buggy then used all his skills and won two games in a row. But Parker did not give in easily. When it was Buggy's turn to serve, he actually won this game again, making the score 3-2. When it was Parker's turn to serve, he cleverly won this game again, making the score 4-2. At this time, the whole audience was cheering for Parker, hoping that something unexpected would happen. If Parker could win two sets in a row against Buggy, who would dare to guarantee that Buggy wouldn't lose the third set? If that really happened, it might become the first miracle in Wimbledon history. However, Buggy was ultimately skilled and bold, and this was also Parker's peak. After that, Buggy returned to normal. After a fierce competition between the two sides, Buggy won four games in a row and won the second set.

In the third set, Buggy again fell behind with a score of 2-3. He still showed his old problem today: his forehand shots often failed to clear the net, but his backhand shots were truly excellent. After several exchanges, he finally took the lead with a score of 5-4. At this time, Parker's momentum was gone, and Buggy won the tenth game, with a score of 6-4, winning the third set.

In the fourth set, Parker already looked tired, but Buggy became more and more courageous. At this time, Buggy was the real Buggy. Parker had no ability to resist his volleying skills. As a result, Buggy won again with a score of 6-1.

▲ Kramm Defeats Austin

In contrast to this match, the match between Kramm and Austin seemed very tense in terms of the score, but it was actually a dull affair. There was a slight competition in the first set, with Kramm winning 8-6. The second set was even more one-sided, and Kramm did not find it difficult to win. There was only a dramatic battle in the third set, but it also became more and more boring. Kramm took a 5-3 lead. Austin, in a helpless state, put up a desperate fight because he was Britain's top player, and it seemed too shameful to lose three sets in a row in front of the British audience. So the score went from 5-5 to 12-12. Kramm seemed to see that Austin's goal was only to win a set and had no other extravagant hopes, so he was a little casual and let Austin win two games in a row, with a score of 14-12. This set took a total of forty minutes. The next day, a British newspaper said that this was a "marathon" tennis match.

In the fourth set, Kramm almost effortlessly won. After a few minutes, he had already won with a score of 6-1, which was not out of the general expectation. The two players in the final this year are Buggy and Kramm.

The men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles have mostly reached the fourth week of the competition. Except for the Australian men's doubles team of Crawford-MacGrath, who were eliminated early, the remaining "main players" have all safely passed. The women's doubles "main players" Mrs. Sporting-Mrs. Yekebushi were defeated today. Considering the strength of the opponent, they were just an ordinary pair of players, and the entire audience sympathized with the fate of these two. As for the elimination results of the mixed doubles, the American team of Buggy-Mrs. Mapu and the French team of Petra-Mrs. Mashu are the strongest, and the American team seems to have a higher chance of winning the championship.

### Overview of Jiangsu Provincial Middle Schools

Significant Progress in Recent Years

Before the 21st year of the Republic of China, there were more than 20 Jiangsu provincial middle schools because middle schools and normal schools were combined. After Director Zhou Fohai took office, recognizing the need for professional training in normal education and the urgent need to expand vocational education, he abolished the combined middle and normal school system in the autumn of the 21st year and designated eight middle schools, including Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Taicang, Huaiyin, Donghai, Rugao, Suzhou Girls' Middle School, and Xuzhou Girls' Middle School, to specialize in normal schools. In the following year, Suqian, Yancheng, Songjiang, and other middle schools were successively converted into vocational schools with glass and advanced chemistry departments. As of the 25th year, together with the Jiangning Junior Middle School established the previous year and the public Nanjing Middle School, there were a total of 12 middle schools (normal schools, rural normal schools, and vocational schools are not included). Among them, Shanghai Middle School, Yangzhou Middle School, Suzhou Middle School, and Zhenjiang Middle School had more grades and larger scales. Zheng Tonghe, the principal of Shanghai Middle School, Zhou Houhushu of Yangzhou Middle School, and Jiang Zhuzhu of Songjiang Girls' Middle School have served the longest, for more than ten years. In terms of the "area" of each school site, Zhenjiang Middle School covers 850 acres, followed by Shanghai Middle School with 450 acres, Yangzhou Middle School with 260 acres, Suzhou Middle School with 152 acres, Jiangning Junior Middle School with 100 acres, Xuzhou Middle School with 90 acres, Changzhou Middle School with 56 acres, Nanjing Middle School with 37 acres, Nantong and Huaian each with 35 acres, and Songjiang Girls' Middle School with 30 acres, with Nanjing Girls' Middle School's 20 acres being the smallest. The school has already purchased 80 acres of the Sheshan base in Hanxi, Nanjing, to build a new school. In terms of "students," Shanghai Middle School has 26 grades with 1,295 students, Yangzhou Middle School has 23 grades with 952 students, Zhenjiang Middle School has 21 grades with 951 students, Suzhou Middle School has 11 grades with 937 students, Nanjing Girls' Middle School has 14 grades with 559 students, Nanjing Middle School has 11 grades with 648 students, Nantong Middle School has 12 grades with 511 students, Xuzhou Middle School has 11 grades with 480 students, Changzhou Middle School has 10 grades with 334 students, Songjiang Girls' Middle School has 10 grades with 396 students, Huaian Middle School has 9 grades with 388 students, and Jiangning Junior Middle School has 5 grades with 193 students. In terms of "faculty," Shanghai Middle School has the most with 102 people, followed by Yangzhou Middle School with 99 people, Suzhou Middle School with 92 people, Zhenjiang Middle School with 77 people, Nanjing Girls' Middle School with 52 people, Xuzhou and Tongzhou each with 45 people, Huaian Middle School with 41 people, Changzhou and Nanjing each with 35 people, Songjiang Girls' Middle School with 34 people, and Jiangning Junior Middle School with 25 people. The regular expenses of each school in the 25th year were 149,819 yuan, Yangzhou Middle School 134,836 yuan, Suzhou Middle School 126,099 yuan, Zhenjiang Middle School 116,504 yuan, Nanjing Girls' Middle School 65,517 yuan, Xuzhou Middle School 62,423 yuan, Tongzhou Middle School 61,738 yuan, Changzhou Middle School 51,892 yuan, Huaian Middle School 48,751 yuan, Songjiang Girls' Middle School 47,831 yuan, Jiangning Junior Middle School 30,000 yuan, and Nanjing Middle School 44,850 yuan. (Explanation) There are only two girls' middle schools, but all schools except Changzhou Middle School are co-educational. The large expenses of Shanghai, Yangzhou, and Suzhou Middle Schools include vocational education equipment expansion costs. Because of historical reasons, the three schools also offer science, engineering, commerce, civil engineering, and chemical engineering departments. In addition, all the subjects offered by other schools are ordinary subjects, divided into senior and junior high school departments (Jiangning Middle School will add a senior high school department in the next year), mostly double-track, three-track, and single-track. Nanjing was originally a public school, but it received a lot of provincial subsidies. It is the oldest school among the middle schools in Jiangsu Province.

### Shanhai Industrial School Group Goes to Annam as Little Teachers

Hoping Annam Youth Overseas Students Return to the Country

Annam overseas Chinese Shen Jinquan and Lin Lichen returned to China two years ago and entered the Shanhai Industrial School in this port as Little Teacher researchers. They have now completed their studies. Except for Lin Lichen, who is still staying in Shanghai to continue his studies, Shen Jinquan took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili wheel to Hong Kong last night and transferred to Saigon. According to Shen's departure statement to reporters, "I am now nineteen years old and Lin is sixteen years old. Because we were isolated from Chinese culture in Annam, we returned to China some time ago, hoping to bring what we have learned in China back to Annam and pass it on to our compatriots. Therefore, we studied at Shanhai Industrial School. I am determined to be a Chinese Little Teacher in Vietnam because the people in Annam are relatively insensitive and there are not many young people who are advancing. If our overseas Chinese want to develop academically, returning to the motherland is the best way. Therefore, I hope that all young students traveling to Vietnam can return to China to study."

### Securities

Public Bonds Rebound with Short Covering and Arbitrage: Prices Surge by 2.6 to 4 Yuan, Aided by Collateral

Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a surge in short covering, long positions, and arbitrage trading in public bonds. The flourishing scene of the past has reappeared, demonstrating the confidence of bondholders. However, a certain bank was furious because the interest rate for spot market of Type Wu bonds was even higher. Therefore, there was a rumor that public bonds could be used as collateral at 80% of the market price with a monthly interest rate of 6%, with no limit on the amount of collateral accepted. As a result, in the first and second sessions, the spot market of Type Wu bonds was heavily traded. This shows that some financiers are blindly speculating and neglecting legitimate speculation. At the opening yesterday, there was more arbitrage trading in No. 6 and No. 43. No. 5, 18, 37, 50, and 54, etc., were bought, while No. 10, 35, and 44, etc., were still sold. The market price averaged 2.6 to 2.8 yuan higher. In the second session, Type Wu bonds for this month surged 1.35 yuan due to swap relationships. The price of Type Ding bonds for this month also rose slightly by 0.05 yuan. From the forward market, the price continued to rise, becoming stronger later. Type Jia bonds for this month also rose 2.45 yuan. The bullish sentiment among the speculators gradually intensified, but the excessive surge was slightly concerning. As a result, the market price rose by 2.6 to 4.05 yuan. No. 96 also rose by more than 1 yuan. The total trading volume was 31.1 million yuan. The results of the price changes are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).

U.S. Stock Market Demand Remains Good

Although there was profit-taking in the New York stock market yesterday, most of the demand remained good. If there are no particularly adverse developments, the market conditions should rise even higher soon.

### Yarn and Cotton

Chinese Yarn Higher Than Foreign Yarn by More Than 10 Yuan, Marked Yarn Continues to Rise

The yarn market continues to soar, thanks to a good atmosphere and rising securities prices. Sales of spot yarn are improving, and foreign yarn prices are also rising. The Sichuan merchants have strong purchasing power, and warehouse stocks of yarn are shrinking daily, leading to market confidence. However, the current market price of yarn has reached a high level, with the price of 20-count yarn reaching 282-283 yuan, more than 10 yuan higher than foreign yarn. Moreover, various parties are continuously purchasing large quantities, and the excitement is slightly cooling down.

Nearby and Forward Contracts Rise Again by About 2 Yuan

At the opening of the marked yarn market, contracts for all months continued to rise. Market sentiment was lively, and spot yarn business was also doing well with strong buying interest. Contracts for this month surged 3.6 yuan, while forward contracts rose 1.1-1.4 yuan. After the second session, it was heard that public bonds had also risen, making the market even more stable. However, some people were unwilling to speculate due to the increasing banditry, so trading felt especially quiet. By the time the market closed, it was weak and fell back slightly. As a result, contracts for all months rose by 1.1 to 2.5 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. Sold: Tongxing 200 bales, Yiji 200 bales, Yuanda 200 bales, Hexing 250 bales, Ruida 950 bales, Shenda 350 bales, Shenji 350 bales, Guda 350 bales, Shengyuan 650 bales, Tonghe 200 bales, Xincheng 600 bales. Bought: Dafu 650 bales, Chengji 300 bales, Dafeng 1000 bales, Taixing 350 bales, Xingchang 500 bales, Renfeng 350 bales, Jiankang 900 bales, Xinhua 1150 bales. The highest and lowest prices for half a day are listed on the left.

Spot Yarn Sales Still Decent

Yesterday, various merchant groups purchased a total of 1335 bales of spot yarn, with prices rising by 1-2 yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below.

Cotton Expected to Rise but Instead Falls

The cotton market initially rose but then retreated, with the trend remaining normal. Old cotton is not needed due to the lack of demand from cotton mills. As for the domestic production of new cotton, the current weather conditions are favorable. Overseas, U.S. cotton is steadily declining. Therefore, although the yarn market is gradually rising, the cotton market is moving in the opposite direction.

August Old Cotton Falls Another 0.6 Yuan

At the opening of the marked cotton market, most people believed that the environment would improve and the yarn market would rise again, so short sellers began to cover their positions, and the market continued to advance. August contracts rose 0.5 yuan, but the forward contracts for new cotton felt increasingly weak. However, after entering the market, it was heard that U.S. cotton and Indian cotton were both adjusted, and the market returned to a sluggish path. The price of August old cotton fell again, and new cotton production entered a whirlpool. As a result, August contracts fell 0.6 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the remaining contracts fell 0.15 yuan, except for December contracts, which rose 0.05 yuan. Sold: Tongxing 1100 dan, Dafeng 1000 dan, Yuanda 1000 dan, Senkang 1100 dan, Tongfeng 800 dan, Fukang 700 dan, Tonghe 700 dan, Shenchang 700 dan, Ruida 700 dan. Bought: Dafu 3900 dan, Yuanyi 1700 dan, Jinghua 1000 dan, Xincheng 3300 dan, Yikang 800 dan, Xinxing 800 dan. The highest and lowest prices for half a day are listed on the left.

Japanese Factories Actively Purchasing Cotton

For spot cotton consumption, Japanese factories are gradually becoming more active in purchasing. However, Chinese merchants have no interest, mainly because the recent sales of spot cotton yarn are not weak, and the local cotton futures market has stabilized, boosting confidence. Therefore, Japanese merchants purchased 1000 bales of new cotton, for a total transaction volume of more than 2000 bales. 84 bales of Yao cotton arrived at the wharf.

Qinghan Yarn Prices Also Quickly Rebound

▲ Osaka: August 23rd Osaka Telegram: Spot yarn fell 1 yuan. 16-count fan surface 235 yuan, 40-count five-star 350 yuan, 42-count pheasant 365 yuan, all unchanged. 20-count goldfish 254 yuan, fell 1 yuan. Three-product futures yarn rose 0.5 to 2.6 yuan, near-term 258.9 yuan, far-term 243.9 yuan. Also, cotton futures fell 0.15 to 0.3 yuan, near-term 72.7 yuan, far-term 74.4 yuan.

Favorable Weather Reports, U.S., British, and Indian Cotton All Decline

Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with favorable weather and smooth cotton harvesting in the South, especially in Vicksburg. At the same time, there was a lack of buying stimulus. Contracts for all months fell 2-4 points. Initially, local merchants bought, and there was a rebound, but unfortunately, no one followed up, and foreign merchants and New Orleans began to sell off, and the market became sluggish again. Weather forecasts indicated good weather in the East, cloudy and rainy conditions in the Central region, and cloudy conditions in parts of the West, except for Oklahoma. At the close, short positions were covered, and the market tightened. Spot prices fell 3 points, and futures prices ranged from unchanged to down 5 points. British spot cotton fell 3 points, and futures fell 4-5 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by European exporters and short covering, but later retreated due to beneficial rain in parts of the Central Provinces. Nagpur rose 0.75 rupees, Oomra fell 2 rupees, and Berar fell 0.75-1 rupee. Original telegram recorded on the left (August 22nd telegram).

### Piece Goods

Activity in Local Cotton Cloth Strengthens

Yesterday, the piece goods market saw a positive trend for white fabrics. Spot goods of popular brands like Dongpi's thin cloth, Gaodang's leading brand, and Wufu, etc., were scarce. Dye factories continued to increase their demand for blue cloth from the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. As a result, purchasing was strong. The yarn market gradually rebounded, and confidence was strengthened. The market price rose another 5 cents per piece. Total transaction volume for the day was 500-600 pieces. Foreign firms opened a few hundred pieces of recent-production Labatong thin cloth and thin twill. Business in Dongpi's department store goods consistently declined, while the activity in local cloth strengthened. The Guangdong merchants continued to add 400-plus pieces of thin twill and coarse cloth from factories in Shanghai and Changzhou, and 100-plus pieces of thin cloth. The Changsha merchants were handling 60-70 pieces of thin cloth and thin twill. The Jiangxi merchants had already left Shanghai, and new goods were slowly arriving. The purchased goods were being packed and shipped daily. Inland wholesale in this street tightened credit, and the market became even more stagnant. Business in the retail stores was even more deserted.

### Finance

After the opening, the HSBC rate remained flat. The near contract had been hardening. Banks were trying to sell off, while foreign firms and Huayi were buying, but the situation was stiff. However, the Japanese exchange rate was stable. In the future, foreign firms will continue to buy U.S. dollars, while overseas firms will sell off. Sassoon tried to boost the U.S. dollar swap, but there were many bids. At the close, the selling price for the near contract was 1 shilling and 2.25 pence for the British pound, and 29.5625 yuan for the U.S. dollar, which was still flat compared to the previous close, but there was still a possibility of further easing.

### Grains

Rumors of Export Bans in Hunan Province, Xiang Glutinous Rice Prices Soar by About 0.2 Yuan

Yesterday, spot sales of Xiang glutinous rice were active both in the North and South. In the South, Xiamen, in addition to Shantou, was actively buying. In the North, there was also outflow from Jijiang. Arrivals of coarse rice had not been strong recently, while demand within the local market remained strong. It was rumored that the local government in Hunan Province had banned exports, leading to a unified upward trend in sentiment both locally and abroad. Production areas also sent messages saying they would slow down sales. Market prices immediately jumped up 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Total offerings for the day included 7566 bags of Gan rice, 4920 bags of Xiang rice, and 850 bags of coarse Sha-Han rice. Although reports of lower prices for foreign wheat were seen, continued orders were not made due to unprofitable transportation.

Bai Geng and Bo Dao Reduced Prices to Sell

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, nearly 30 sources from various merchant groups supplied a total of 6200-6300 shi of goods. The local sales market turned sluggish after the forenoon, so market conditions became weak. Fortunately, there were not many arrivals. As a result, the price of slightly thicker early Geng rice depreciated slightly by a few cents to about 0.1 yuan, and the price of Bo Dao rice fell by 0.1 yuan. Du Yang and Jian Dai were weak, while Yin Bian Yuan was mediocre.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few arrivals of boats from various merchant groups downstream, about 20 boats. At the opening in the morning, trading was exceptionally quiet, causing prices to fall back by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Later, because of the small price cuts, merchants slightly bought up the particularly Bai Geng rice, bringing the price back up by about 0.1 yuan. Lower and middle-grade rice fell by about 0.2 yuan. Bo Dao was scarce, so merchants' appetite was still acceptable, and prices were strong. Du Jian was weak, and Bai Yuan was stable. Other goods were also weak.

New Yellow Soybeans Increased, Lowered Again

▲ Soybean Cake Sales Market Still Active

Yesterday, the new yellow soybean market showed mixed signals. Due to uneven arrivals and sales, the trend was to increase prices first, then lower them again. At the opening, there were over 200 bags of Chengmen beans. The price of Jiangqiao beans fell 0.03-0.04 yuan, while prices of Sanyang beans fell 0.08-0.09 yuan. Over 280 bags of Duchang beans were traded for the first time, with prices ranging from 6.05 to 5.9 yuan. The Yamabento street dealers bought them. The market for soybean cake remained active, with over 22,000 pieces of current and forward soybean cake traded. Prices continued to rise by 0.01 yuan, which helped stabilize the old soybean market. Oil extraction plants were also actively buying. Yesterday, the pure market traded over 500 bags of various soybeans.

Wheat Flour Still Without New Transactions

Yesterday, the wheat flour market only settled transactions for the day, without any new developments. Due to practical difficulties, the market was even more quiet. As for the ban on wheat flour exports, a solution has been determined. Those who are not suspected of aiding the enemy will be permitted exports with certification from the municipal chamber of commerce and trade associations. If the ban continues to be rigidly enforced, it will not only affect the social economy, but also the working class. Regarding wheat, because wheat flour will soon be able to circulate, merchants and factories have had discussions. However, factories want to lower prices slightly, while merchants want to raise them, so they have not reached an agreement, resulting in no transactions. A new agreement may be reached next week.

### Oil Market

Tung Oil Arrivals Are Scarce, Signs of Turnaround, Domestic Inventory Still Very Abundant

The white tung oil market has been in decline since the beginning of summer. The main destination for foreign firms is the United States. It is now reported that the United States has an inventory of over 30,000 tons, which can supply their needs for 5-6 months at a consumption rate of 5-6,000 tons per month. Therefore, exports from our country have not been enthusiastic in the last month or two. The lowest price in the Hankou market is only 45-46 yuan per dan, including tax. Recently, due to the scarcity of arrivals, there has been a slight turnaround. According to last night's Hankou telegram, the price has risen to 50.34 yuan. However, a detailed investigation reveals that the inventory in various producing areas is abundant, so although there may be a temporary upturn, it will be difficult to sustain. Although there are still 3-4 months before the new production season, the national inventory is estimated to be 600,000 dan, which is significantly higher than in previous years. Therefore, the future market is expected to be long-term weak and short-term volatile. This port relies on Zhejiang tung oil for supply. Since the recent suspension of freight trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway, arrivals in Shanghai have been cut off, and the market is quite scarce. Measures are now being taken to transport by waterway, and arrivals have slightly increased, but the transportation time has been extended and freight costs have increased, so each shi needs to be around 50 yuan.

### Dried Goods

New Almonds Sell Most Actively to Guangdong

The almond harvest is very abundant this year, and the market was expected to decline, but due to the sudden changes in the situation, transportation in Pinglü countryside has been significantly blocked, which has prevented the market from being flooded with supply. Yesterday, Xishan Baiyu Biang almonds opened at 140 yuan, medium-grade at 132 yuan, Beishan almonds at 110 yuan, Zhangfang Xing almonds at 110 yuan, Yunjun Kuangyou at 104 yuan, Jiudaomei at 72 yuan, and medium-grade almonds at 68 yuan. Recently, purchases have been most concentrated in Guangzhou, followed by foreign firms and pharmacies. Local retail is also very active, and market conditions are stable.

### Silk and Tea

Chinese and French Silk Prices Gradually Approaching ▲ French Companies Made Inquiries Yesterday

Yesterday, the silk market became more stable, and silk prices in Japan and the United States also rose (New York near-term up 2 cents, far-term up 1 cent, Yokohama spot up 5 yuan, far-term up 15 yuan). Local users were more active in purchasing, and speculators also increased their buying activity. The offered prices generally rose by more than 10 yuan. Foreign firms made inquiries. It is rumored that White Factory B-grade silk with no uniformity of 20-22 strands was sold for 790 yuan, but this has not been confirmed. If this news is confirmed, the Chinese and French market prices would be very close, and the European silk market, which has been holding back for a long time, should be able to expand. Yesterday, 70 dan were traded in the local market and 20 dan in the Indian market.

Report on Raw Silk Exports for the First Half of the Month

At the beginning of this month, the domestic rising trend was strong, and foreign sales decreased significantly due to the large difference in silk prices. According to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, 798 dan were exported to Europe, 485 dan to the United States, and 110 dan to Asian and African ports, for a total of 1393 dan. The total exports for the past one and a half months were 3267 dan, a decrease of 1389 dan compared to the same period last year. Silk prices have risen significantly. The export volume and silk price comparisons for this period are listed below for reference.

Black and Green Tea are Both Firm

Yesterday, the foreign tea market was even firmer. Black tea from Qimen, Fuliang, and other areas continued to be sold, and the overall market sentiment was upward. Prices rose by 1-2 yuan. Qimen floral tea, sold over 1000 boxes to Russian firms, and the offering price was 33-34 yuan. The market was not deserted either. Both Lufang and Tuzhuang Zhenmei teas saw slightly stronger trading. Jinlong, Xiehe, and other firms purchased quite a bit, and market prices have been trending upward. Among them, the fine needle eyebrow item was particularly popular.

### Sugar Market

Some Transactions in Coarse Granulated and White Sugar

### Forbidden Books, Poetry

— Wu Cun

July 22, 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937], the newspaper reported that negotiations for the Lugou Bridge Incident had concluded. Our side, in accordance with the agreement, withdrew troops, while the Japanese side increased the transport of military supplies. "Peace" was hoped for, yet the entire nation grieved.

The Shen Bao reported on the 23rd, a telegram from Tianjin:

Since the 18th, Japanese troops have been stationed at the Tianjin Post Office to inspect mail. The post office has reported this to the central and local authorities separately. After repeated negotiations with the Japanese military by the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, Li Wentian, understanding has been reached with Hashimoto and Fujii. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the Japanese personnel stationed at the post office to inspect mail were ordered to withdraw and no longer inspect. On the same day, the News reported a telegram from Peiping [Beijing]:

The Supervisory Office recently investigated and banned the sale of a large number of publications in bookstores within the city, including The Voice of North China, Northeast Knowledge, Anti-Japanese Frontline, Anti-Japanese General, Anti-Enemy Life, International Knowledge, The People's Road, Patriotic Anthology, Reading Life, Chinese, The Voice of China, Sanmin Monthly, Guilin Monthly, etc., more than sixty titles in all. The police bureau has been ordered to prohibit their sale.

“You give me a peach, I will repay you with jade.” Since you have agreed to stop inspecting mail, and have received our "understanding," we will certainly strictly prohibit the sale of publications, to show "friendship." You don't inspect, I will ban. "It is not retaliation, but will forever be good." We are originally of the same language and culture, two extremely loving "major nations of East Asia"!

Such a grand event, how can it not be recorded! — The poem says:

Bloodstains fresh by Lugou Bridge,
Laughter and talk fill the cultured city.
Who says opening the door invites the thief?
Our generals dearly love peace.

The Supervisory Office submits its imperial ban,
Innocent books and newspapers bitterly sink.
A storm rages through the literary city,
A heart of reciprocating gifts.

Don't say the divine land sinks,
The Chinese land is devoid of ethics.
Only pity the moon over the Wu-ting River,
Forever shining on the souls of warriors!

### Do Not Discuss National Affairs

— Jia Qian

There was a time when public places had a "Do Not Discuss National Affairs" rule, the reason for which is unknown and bewildering! Perhaps it is like what the new lyricist said, "National affairs are none of your business, just play mahjong." But, can "national affairs" really be "none of your business"? That is not necessarily the case. Even if "China is so disappointing, so people dare not speak their minds," (see Zeng Jinke's "Reply to a Young Man's Letter"), if a citizen "talks" about "national affairs," whether with reason or without, it should not be considered a crime, right? However, because "national affairs cannot be managed, so we can only not manage them," thus putting "profound pain in this sentence (i.e., 'play mahjong') to vent the bitterness of the time" (Reply to a Young Man's Letter) as a reason for "Do Not Discuss National Affairs," which I think is inappropriate.

At this time, on the eve of a storm, young people all feel bewildered and bitter, but the new lyricist also heard people shouting various slogans at that time. Slogans may not necessarily be put into practice, but it is possible to see many young people finding a way out in their bewilderment and bitterness from these slogans. The government has also made a clear statement about "opening up freedom of speech." Then, in addition to being disappointing, China should not make people afraid to speak their minds!

Looking at the enthusiastic public sentiment after the Lugouqiao Incident, everyone can "talk" about "national affairs." If, because of bitterness, you gather four people to fill a table and "play mahjong," I'm afraid amidst the clamor of "blank tiles" and "central wind," you won't realize that "today's Hebei and Chahar will become yesterday's Northeast Four Provinces."

The view of "Do Not Discuss National Affairs" is wrong. There is no need to use excuses such as fearing that illegal elements will take the opportunity to cause trouble. Every citizen has the right to "talk about national affairs," and it is precisely because we want to "talk about national affairs" that it has aroused the interference of the Public Works Department, who believes "we are fish and meat." Yesterday's "Li Bao" reported: "Last night (22nd) at 11 pm, many young people gathered on the grass of the Bund Park, discussing the current situation out of concern. However, as the number of people increased, the police saw this and drove them out of the park. The young people believed that discussing the current situation was a common occurrence, and there was no illegal behavior, so they remained in the park. Seeing this, the police notified the police station to arrest

## Page 16

many people. As a result, four young people were arrested and then released."

"The authorities in the concessions have forgotten that their position is that of a concession, and they treat us entirely as a colony." Zhou Jianyun said these painful words at the preparatory meeting for the Shanghai cultural circle's movement to abolish the right of the concessions to censor opera and films. Of course, the concession authorities will not forget that their position is that of a concession. Those who treat us entirely as a colony want us to forget that it is a concession, so movies are not allowed to have maps of the Northeast Four Provinces, and singing salvation songs in the park is considered an "offense." "Being concerned about the current situation and gathering to discuss" is naturally something that those "police officers who eat the emperor's food and repay the emperor's favor" think should result in imprisonment.

In the past, parks in the concessions had signs saying "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed." Now, at least they have paid a one-dollar head tax and can enter and exit freely. But "when you get to the concession, you must forget that you are Chinese!" In the shadows of green vines, by the Han River pond, it is best to have couples together, whispering sweet nothings. Then, even if the number of people "increases," they will drag their batons and quietly avoid you. If you want to sing salvation songs and talk about the current situation, this will inevitably conflict with "treating us entirely as a colony," because their position is still ultimately a "concession."

People are hoping that we "do not discuss national affairs"—this is probably not far from the "policy of keeping the people ignorant." China is so disappointing, but can the common people "just not care"?

We want to "talk about national affairs." At 1 am on the 23rd, our newspaper received an urgent telegram from Beiping: After China and Japan finalized an agreement on the morning of the 21st for both sides to withdraw troops, the Japanese troops in the Dajing Village area, five miles from Lugouqiao, should have withdrawn at the same time. However, as of 6 pm on the 22nd, the Japanese troops showed no signs of withdrawal and increased the number of large and small steel cannons by more than 20. A large amount of poisonous gas was also transported to the area east of Lugouqiao... Who allowed them to "decide" this "final agreement"?

### Roar, China!

— Li Gan Zuo

### A Century of History of the Böcking Factory in Tegel, Berlin, Germany

July 22, 1937, marks the centenary of the most famous Böcking factory in Tegel, Berlin. A grand celebration was held in Berlin, Germany. The founder of the Böcking factory and his descendants' history of founding the factory are listed below:

The factory was founded by Vogt Theodor Böcking, who was born in Weißblau, Germany, in 1804. He first learned carpentry there, and later had the opportunity to work in a foundry and machine factory. Because of his hard work, he was soon promoted to manager. At that time, he was still young and not satisfied with this environment. He gathered all his savings and founded a small-scale machine factory in Berlin in December 1836. The first batch of products made were 16,000 screws. At that time, 50 workers were employed. By mid-1837, a relatively complete machine factory was established. The power required at that time was only driven by two horses, and the furnace used bellows. On July 22, 1837, the first cast iron was produced, and this day was designated by Vogt Theodor Böcking as the anniversary of the factory's founding.

In the spring of 1838, the first steam engine manufactured by the factory was completed. Since then, the manufacturing method has been gradually improved, and products such as looms and sugar-making machines have been produced. Furthermore, steam engines, steam boilers, and water pumps have also begun to be manufactured.

In 1841, the first locomotive was made. Since then, a large number of locomotive orders have been received, making the factory's business prosperous. Vogt Theodor Böcking believed that locomotives would be in great demand, so he worked on improving them and striving for excellence. Before long, this product became the most famous in the world. Later, due to insufficient supply, it was expanded into a large-scale manufacturing factory.

In 1847, steel and iron plates were produced. At this point, Vogt Theodor Böcking was able to fulfill his original ambition of not seeking foreign goods. A year later, he bought another machine factory. When the factory started, Böcking wanted to further develop his business and strive for independence, so he leased coal and iron ore mines upstream of the Schellieser for self-sufficiency. Unfortunately, at this time, he abandoned everything and passed away in 1854.

Albert was the son of Vogt Theodor Böcking. At that time, he was 25 years old. He inherited his father's ambition and engaged in business operations. Later, products such as shipping machinery, railway materials, and ship hulls were produced. During the war from 1870 to 1871, he manufactured military equipment such as mines, torpedoes, and gun carriages. As for the manufacture of locomotives, it had become a world-renowned honor product.

Albert Böcking passed away in 1878. At that time, the number of staff in the Berlin factory and Schellieser was twice that of when his father passed away. Because his sons and descendants, Einar, Ernst, and Carl, were still young, his father Albert authorized the board of directors. However, the directors were afraid of taking responsibility, resulting in a slight decline in the factory's products.

In 1894, the three brothers grew up and took responsibility. The eldest brother, Einar, was in charge of the mining operations upstream of the Schellieser, but he tragically died in a mining accident in 1897.

Ernst and Carl, seeing that the old-fashioned machinery was not very suitable, decided to establish a new factory in Tegel. This factory was prepared in 1896, and production began in 1898. The equipment in the factory was extremely sophisticated and comprehensive, and the products were even more complete, such as refrigerating machines, air gas compressors, and Mammut pumps. Before long, all the equipment for chemical plants and oil presses were also available.

When the European War started from 1914 to 1918, the factory specialized in manufacturing military weapons. After the war, it worked hard to operate, and products such as steam turbine oil presses were produced. However, after the war, the vitality of various countries had not recovered, and sales were stagnant. The domestic railway administration was also unable to purchase new vehicles, so the factory was slightly affected.

By 1930, the Böcking factory had produced 12,000 locomotives. In 1933, it merged with the Lemida factory. Since then, business has been revived, and orders from various countries are crowded. The number of employees is increasing daily, so an engineering office of the Lemida Böcking Machinery Factory was established in China at Room 704, Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road, Shanghai.

▲ The annual China Insurance Yearbook, since it was compiled and published by Shen Leichun in 1935 and 1936, has been greatly praised by insurance scholars and insurance practitioners for its novel materials and rich content, and its reputation has grown day by day. When compiling this year's yearbook, in order to gather wisdom and expand planning, insurance industry leaders from all over the country were widely sought to provide local surveys, so as to have a clear understanding of the insurance business in various places. Economists from all over the country were also invited to state their opinions on the insurance business, so as to provide assistance for insurance practitioners to improve. Therefore, the 1937 China Insurance Yearbook is not only beautifully decorated and well printed, but also the content and materials are much better than before. It is heard that the book has been scheduled to be published today, and the price is still four yuan. All major bookstores and the society at 42 Hehe Lane, Xiafei Road, are selling it on consignment.

### Stamp Collecting Gossip

— Chen Jianxia

"Things in the world are valued for their scarcity," this saying is truly an unbreakable maxim. General antique collectors regard rare antiquities, such as Xia cauldrons, Shang burials, Jin calligraphy, and Kang inscriptions, as treasures, worth a fortune. This is the principle.

Stamps, after being used, seem to have become waste. But there are many old stamps in the world that are considered priceless treasures, and people are scrambling to obtain them. Isn't that unbelievable?

The history of stamps in European countries is very long, so there are also many stamp collectors. Their interest in studying stamps far exceeds other antiques. There are stamp dealers who specialize in buying and selling stamps, large companies that organize the circulation of stamps, and special books that study the era, form, value, and identify authenticity. Almost all old stamps are treated like ordinary goods. Each stamp has a certain standard price, and sometimes old stamp exhibitions and on-the-spot auctions are held. Due to the different trends in supply and demand, there are even changes in market prices. Therefore, the purpose of many stamp collectors is not only to love treasures, but also to regard it as a kind of savings that can be used to profit.

China's postal service began during the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, only about forty years ago. But there are already many famous and valuable old stamps that are well-known. The earliest commonly used stamps only used a square red paper, stamped with a wooden chop with words, which was considered effective. The paper quality was poor, and the handwriting was not very clear. Although there are still remnants, the value is not very expensive. Probably because this kind of old stamp is prone to forgery, it is not valued by general stamp collectors. Among Chinese stamps, the most valuable is a red stamp with small characters meaning one yuan. At that time, this stamp was temporarily issued as a commemoration of Empress Dowager Cixi's birthday. Later, it was abolished because the characters were small and replaced with large characters. There are only a few with small characters, and now each one costs more than 1,500 yuan. In addition, there are also deformed variations such as the large-character one-yuan dragon gate inverted cover, which are all high-priced treasures in national stamps.

In short, any special and rare stamps can be used as rare goods for stamp collectors. I remember eight or nine years ago, when airmail stamps were first issued, during the first three days of the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai airmail route, the post office used red stamps for commemorative purposes. General stamp collectors bought stamps and sent letters like crazy, and even filled an empty letter with airmail stamps of various prices in order to obtain a red stamp as a pleasure. A friend of mine spent about 300 yuan in this battle, and as a result, he got many colorful old stamp envelopes. Those who didn't know it must have laughed at him as crazy. Who knew that before long, a stamp collector from Jiangxi came and offered a price of 80 yuan to exchange for an envelope. The two people's negotiations still recognized each other as very affectionate!

The most famous stamp collector in China is Zhou Jinjue, who is known as the Stamp King among insiders. It is said that all his stamps are worth no less than two or three hundred thousand. He even has four of the above-mentioned small one-yuan red flowers connected together, which can be regarded as a rare treasure among national stamps. No stamp collectors at home and abroad are not envious of it. In the past, Yuan Hanyun, the son of Hongxian, was also a stamp collecting expert, but later, due to economic reasons, there was news that he had transferred his entire stamp collection. I don't know where these stamps are now.

As for the method of stamp collecting, the first condition is certainly inseparable from money. If you have sufficient financial resources, you can freely choose and purchase your favorite boutiques, and after summing them up into a collection, you can immediately have a magnificent view. Secondly, regardless of whether they are new or old stamps, you can try to collect them within the scope of your ability. It is best if a friend is responsible for receiving and sending in a company or organization, and it is easier to entrust them to arrange for it. Accumulating in this way will inevitably lead to various different styles, and then try to exchange them with others, trading what you have for what you don't have. It is not impossible to form a stamp collection in this way.

If the stamp collection is spectacular, you must then demand a formal sophistication. The stamp album must be exquisitely decorated, and each stamp should be surrounded by transparent cellophane, so that it can permanently preserve its color. The gluing procedure should also not be sloppy. Specially made adhesive paper should be used so that you can freely change its position. Such a stamp collection, no matter what its value, must be very magnificent. When you feel inspired, it is fun to take it out and admire it, and its pleasure is no less than that of ancient books and famous paintings. Then collect at any time, and treasure it at any time, you can develop a lasting habit, and you can improve your appreciation of emotions. Especially in terms of valuation, you can assemble the zero into a whole, not only without losing a penny, but perhaps also having considerable benefits. Isn't it several things at once?

### Application of Basic Footwork in Tap Dance

— Zheng Lio

One of the quintuplet footwork methods - The Four-Cut Note: I have an impression, I remember when I was young, I saw several song and dance groups from Shanghai in a certain place. It was the time when the Li school of singing and music was popular. What I saw was so-called tap dance. The onomatopoeic word, but they wore rubber-soled cloth shoes, and didn't make a single sound, the mechanical jump from side to side, seems not to have disappeared to this day, which shows that the abuse of foreign art will only be a laughing stock. Nowadays, naturally thanks to the influence and driving force of Hollywood dance, China has a foundation for tap dance. However, art has no borders, and is the natural evolution of mankind.

This kind of dance art is called iron-bottom dance in Hong Kong, Macau, and other places, and rapid foot dance in Nanyang, Singapore, Vietnam, etc. When I performed in the capital without a day this year, they made foot sound dance. Now, they usually still use the past terms tap or tap dance, which seems not to be the phonetic translation of the English TAP, DANCE. I think the name suggests, the foot jumps out of sound, the name foot sound dance is extremely consistent, or foot sound dance, and it is more appropriate to translate the meaning of the English.

Now let's talk about the four-cut note, because its foot sound needs to be more obvious. Its standard footwork is: ㊀ Lift the left foot forward and use the sole of the foot to land and make the first sound. ㊁ Then the heel lands and makes the second sound, and the body slightly sinks. ㊂ Lift the right foot forward and use the toe of the foot to land and make the third sound. At the same time, the left foot is off the ground and the body moves forward. ㊃ Use the heel of the left foot to land and make the fourth sound, while the right foot is lifted again and the body slightly sinks. Jumping down, you can continue to proceed with the right foot. The footwork is the same as above. The above is a total of four sounds, each estimated to be one beat.

Starting with a quintuplet, the four-cut note is four beats with a total of seven sounds—based on the four-cut note footwork and beats, without the difficulty of a three-section note, that is, first use the left foot to kick out the quintuplet, which represents the ㊀㊁ sound, in which the triplet occupies one beat, and the remaining two sounds occupy one beat, and the body slightly sinks, the remaining ㊂㊃ is the same as the above two beats, adding up to a total of four beats—four-section note foot position diagram:

### Introducing a New Amateur Opera Performer

— Ruo

The little amateur opera performer is Mr. Hu Fangming's third son, Hu Guorong. He is only nine years old, has a martial air about him and is already familiar with martial arts operas. In the past, I have visited the Shidai Piaofang (Opera Club) run by his father and saw him playing with spears and chanting gongs and drums, running among the guests, and every move was in harmony with the rhythm. I secretly marveled at his extraordinary character. Last spring, the piaofang felt a lack of martial arts actors, so they encouraged his father to let him learn the play "Baisuitan". Within a few months, his skills greatly improved. Later, at his father's 50th birthday celebration, I watched him perform this play. His stance was concise, his spear skills were skillful, and he was not only entering the hall, but also entering the room. As for the beauty of the art that all martial arts plays should have in his demeanor and small movements, it can be said that he is fully equipped. It is said that his father said that this play is on stage. This is the second time, and he has learned more complex plays such as "Bala Temple" and "Lion Tower". He is truly an outstanding talent rising up in the amateur opera world. The picture below is a still from his performance of "Baisuitan" as Mu Yuqi.

### Zhaofeng Garden on a Summer Night

— Fang Zhou

In the evening, the summer sunset cast two irregular shadows, swaying as they headed towards Avenue Joffre. The dust and exhaust fumes on the road almost suffocated us. Only when we saw the entrance to Zhaofeng Garden did we breathe a sigh of relief. A feeling of joy and ease filled our heavy hearts.

Stepping into the garden, we felt as though we had entered another world. The tree-lined paths, the lush green trees, and the soft, green grass revealed the vibrancy and beauty of nature. We forgot that we were still in the bustling city and temporarily pushed aside the troubles of life. A beautiful dream vividly unfolded before our eyes.

We followed a secluded path towards the shade in front. The grass and the groves were already dotted with young men and women. Although the setting sun was already behind the mountains, its golden afterglow, along with the red light of the evening glow, still peeked out to take one last look at the dim earth, as if with a touch of lingering affection.

The sun had reluctantly hidden behind the horizon, but it was still early. Therefore, there were not many people in the garden yet. Later, the sky gradually darkened, and the number of people in the garden gradually increased, and many chairs were filled.

The curtain of night quickly advanced into nature. The cool breeze of the summer night crept onto the grass by the river. The lovely moon quietly hid among the treetops, smiling and emitting a gentle light, which poured onto the ground like mercury, piled on the treetops, and flowed on the water surface. I couldn't help but exclaim with excitement.

—Oh, this beautiful world, this mysterious night, eternal god, may you remain in this world forever!

I got up from the chair and lay down on the grass by the river, gazing at the floating white clouds and the twinkling stars in a daze. Mei also sat down beside me on the grass, but she just sat there silently, without a word, as if savoring the beauty of the night.

The weeping willows by the river gently brushed the water's surface. As the breeze passed, the still river water flowed with silver-like ripples. Several lights were reflected on the bottom of the river like electric whips. A girl in a red dress led a group of lively children, launching three or five small sailboats on the river. As the boats sailed further away, we could only vaguely see them swaying with the wind, as if disappearing into the distant misty waves. Suddenly, a flock of ducks quacked and swam past, shaking all the small sailboats on the river. The surrounding area was filled with innocent laughter.

Under the moonlight, in the dimly lit areas, pairs of people sat side by side, talking about their love. Shadows of people were scattered across the green lawn like stars in the sky. The jazz music from the thatched pavilion across the river resonated with people's heartstrings, playing a lively tune.

A burst of melodious piano sound slowly drifted in from a small western-style house outside the garden, accompanied by a kind of sad song. I looked up in that direction and saw a dense grove of trees in one corner of the garden. The exquisite roof was faintly visible within the trees. A faint ray of light shone from the window, reflected on the leaves, causing the moonlight above to lose its charming tone and adding a layer of sorrowful color. The piano and singing came from this window.

Irregular footsteps beat out rhythmic tones. Summer insects chirped shrilly by the roadside. The frog drums by the pond and the cicada strings in the branches played a symphony of the summer night. People were talking and laughing, some giving eloquent speeches, some singing in low voices, and some playing the harmonica. All these noises broke the silence of the late night.

We lingered by the lotus pond. The large green frogs in the pond were originally croaking vigorously, but perhaps they heard our footsteps, so when we approached a clump of cattails, they stopped abruptly. A pond of verdant lotus leaves swayed gently, and several budding lotus flowers seemed to be nodding to us. Their graceful and slender postures looked even more beautiful and lovely under the moonlight.

"It's late," let's go back! Finally, we walked out of the garden gate, with light hearts, and set out on our return journey.

"Goodbye, Zhaofeng Garden on a summer night!" As I boarded the double-decker bus, I still craned my neck out of the window and softly bid it farewell, seeming to feel infinite reluctance and melancholy?
