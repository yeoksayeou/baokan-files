[Chongqing] The Finance Supervisory Office of the Field Headquarters is implementing the joint Sichuan-Kang provincial budget. Because the provincial government considers the Sichuan disaster to be unusually severe, it has postponed the collection of land taxes. Therefore, as of the end of May, the provincial tax revenue was short by 7,513,000 yuan, and the arrears of Sichuan-Kang military expenses reached 7,300,000 yuan. However, the Finance Supervisory Office has guaranteed and discounted for the Sichuan-Kang Garrison Headquarters and various armies a total of 3,260,000 yuan.

In addition to borrowing a million yuan from the Chongqing Banking Association on behalf of the Sichuan Finance Department, he also telegraphed Chairman Jiang to instruct the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank to temporarily borrow a million yuan, which has been approved.

### Full Text of the Verdict in the Assassination of Chairman Yang Case (Continued from Yesterday)

[Hankou] Liu Luyin, Xi Baizhou, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, Cai Qunjian, and Nie Jingquan were arrested in various locations including Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhu, and Hankou. A plan for a special operations team was also found in Hong Kong. The Hubei High Court Prosecutor's Office ordered the procurator of this court to investigate and prosecute.

Reasons: The following explanations are provided for each part:

(1) Regarding Cheng Bianchao: The deceased Chairman Yang was shot twice in the lower part of the right side of his back and shoulder blade. The two bullets exited through the lower part of his ribs. One bullet remained lodged in the upper part of the sixth rib. An autopsy report issued by the Hankou Tongren Hospital is attached to the file. It is confirmed that Chairman Yang died from gunshot wounds. It is established that the defendant Cheng Bianchao joined an assassination group through Fan Qishu's introduction in Hankou around September of last year, directly under the command of Yang Xiaoming. They first went to Sandao Street in Wuchang, near the Hubei Provincial Government, to assassinate Chairman Yang but failed. They changed the location and, on October 25th of the same year, took advantage of Chairman Yang's return to Hankou and shot him on the Jiangbian pier in Hankou, resulting in his death. He was immediately arrested as an active offender. A pistol, six bullets, and a magazine were found on his person as evidence. The defendant is an accomplice in the shooting of Chairman Yang and there is no doubt about this. His possession of military firearms and ammunition is a method of murder and should be punished with the crime of murder. Hankou's pier is a place with many military police. Daring to assassinate the highest administrative officer in broad daylight is extremely related to national prestige and local order, so he should be sentenced to death. The pistol, six bullets, magazine, and bullet head are contraband and objects used for the crime and should be confiscated.

(2) Regarding Xi Baizhou: In May of last year, the defendant Xi Baizhou went to Lushan with Yang Qixin at Xiao Zhun's request to investigate the daily life of Chairman Chiang. In August, Yang Xiaoming personally instructed him to continue to investigate Minister Zhang's whereabouts in Beijing with Yang Qixin. They chose the locations for the attack and reported them separately. Xiao Zhun and Yang Xiaoming prepared for the assassination. This has been repeatedly confessed by Yang Qixin. Later, he brought a pistol from Nanjing to Hankou. After Yang Xiaoming showed him a photo of Chairman Yang for identification, he went to Yidao Street in Wuchang with Cheng Bianchao and others to prepare for the assassination. He prepared for the assassination twice near the Hubei Provincial Government. On October 25th, under the command of Yang Xiaoming, he and Cheng Bianchao and others shot Chairman Yang to death at the Jiangbian pier in Hankou. Cheng Bianchao also confessed in detail. Xi Baizhou also stated in the Wuhan office of the Military Affairs Committee Chairman: "I went to Lushan with Yang Qixin to investigate Chairman Chiang's whereabouts. Yang Qixin wrote a letter to report to Xiao Peiwei. Yang Qixin told me in Nanjing that he wanted to assassinate Minister Zhang. We went to see Minister Zhang's residence and investigated the route. Yang Erqian told me to buy a gun and go to Hankou to work. The first and second attempts to assassinate Chairman Yang were in Sandao Street. Tan Rongxuan and I both carried guns, along with Liang Wubao. Later, when assassinating Chairman Yang at Jianghanguan, I actually carried a gun. I was a zhang away from where Tan Rongxuan was standing. The pistol I was holding was German-made, with five bullets," etc. He clearly admitted to the preparations for assassinating Chairman Chiang and Minister Zhang, and the execution of the assassination of Chairman Yang. The fact that Xi Baizhou committed the crime is extremely certain and cannot be denied by empty words after the fact. He should be charged with two counts of joint preparation for murder and one count of joint murder. However, the defendant joined an assassination organization with a general intention, continuously committing the same crime, so it should be considered as one crime. His possession of military firearms and ammunition is a method of murder and should be punished severely. For the crime of continuous joint murder, the defendant and Cheng Bianchao each held loaded pistols and assassinated Chairman Yang with ferocity no less than Cheng Bianchao, so he should also be sentenced to death.

(3) Regarding Cao Bingrong: The defendant Cao Bingrong denies any involvement in the joint assassination of Chairman Yang. However, according to Cheng Bianchao's confession on March 16th of this year, "Zhang Jiayi (i.e., Cao Bingrong) often came to play when we were doing this kind of work. Yang Erqian told Cheng Bianchao and Xi Baizhou what to do (referring to the assassination of Chairman Yang). Zhang Jiayi did not avoid it at the scene." Cao Bingrong also stated in the Wuhan office of the Military Affairs Committee Chairman: "On February 25th, I followed Yang Xiaoming back to Wuchang, to scout Chairman Yang's whereabouts. I knew he was going to Hankou for a banquet and followed him to the Jianghanguan pier. I stood among the people and acted as a marker during the assassination. I was near Jianghanguan and kept watch for them." He also stated in the Capital Police Department, "When Chairman Yang returned to the riverbank and went down the stone steps, we were arranged on both sides. Cheng and Xi both fired." Cao Bingrong initially participated in the planning of the assassination of Chairman Yang. Then he crossed the river with Yang Xiaoming to find out his whereabouts. When Chairman Yang returned to the Jiangbian pier, he was again on the scene keeping watch and making careful arrangements. Although he was only on the scene during the assassination and did not act, he joined the assassination organization with a contractual intention and used others to implement it. According to the Supreme Court's repeated precedents, he should be considered a joint principal offender in murder. However, considering the circumstances of his crime, there is still a difference from those who actually shot and killed, so he should be sentenced to life imprisonment.

(4) Regarding Yang Qixin: In May of the 15th year, the defendant Yang Qixin, at the request of Xiao Zhun's letter, went to Lushan with Xi Baizhou to investigate Chairman Chiang's daily life, considering Guanyin Bridge to be a suitable place for an attack. In August of the same year, at Yang Xiaoming's personal request, he returned to Beijing with Xi Xiangzhou to investigate Minister Zhang's itinerary, considering the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse to be a convenient location for sniping. He reported them separately to Xiao Zhun and Yang Xiaoming to prepare for the assassination. He has repeatedly admitted this and it matches Xi Baizhou's confession. This constitutes two counts of preparing for murder. However, Yang Qixin joined the assassination organization with a general intention, continuously committing the same crime, so he should be charged with one count of continuous joint preparation for murder. The danger caused by his crime is very great, so he should be sentenced to the highest degree of imprisonment for two years.

(5) Regarding Liu Luyin: The defendant Liu Luyin does not understand the hard work of seeking the country in Zhong'an. He has confessed (see handwritten confession) that he cannot be accused of innumerable instigations to murder. The special operations team plan drafted by Yang Xiaoming in the name of Xu Qun briefly stated that in order to develop the work group and achieve its mission, it is necessary to expand the organization. Because there are fewer opportunities in Shanghai, it is not easy to proceed according to plan, so it is necessary to shift the target to Beijing and Hubei, while Shanghai remains the place to lead and promote the work. Another group should be set up in Beijing and Hubei, named "China Youth Eliminate Treachery Special Operations Team." Note 2 regarding activity expenses refers to extraordinary times. 3. The preparatory expenses for extraordinary times are not included in the activity expenses and must be prepared in advance for necessary escape expenses after the event. The organization plan had a plan to expand from Shanghai to Beijing and Hubei. Why is there no legitimate work performance between Shanghai and Beijing and Hubei? Although the plan contains the words "eliminate treachery," the words "escape expenses after the event" in the latter paragraph and mutual reference and verification reveal that the words "eliminate treachery" are clearly a pseudonym for assassination. On the back of the plan, the words "2,000 yuan per month approved by Ru Yunhui" were written. Later, Liu Luyin admitted that he had approved it. Xiao Ruolu's written confession stated, "Liu Luyin instigated murder." There is no doubt that Liu Luyin instigated the organization of the assassination team. The assassination team's conspiracy to assassinate Minister Chiang, Minister Yu, prepare to assassinate Minister Zhang, Chairman Chiang, and execute the assassination of Chairman Yang all proceeded step by step according to the plan approved by Liu Luyin. Although he argued, "I did not read the contents of the plan and approved it based on oral descriptions." With Liu Luyin's position as a standing committee member, how could he rashly approve such an important document without reading its contents? He also claimed, "I resigned from the standing committee of the Civil Movement Association and was not aware of the case." However, since he had instigated the organization of the assassination team, even if he resigned from the standing committee later, it would not prevent the establishment of the crime of instigation. Furthermore, the special operations team members such as Cheng Bianchao initially had no intention of killing. Their preparation for murder, conspiracy to murder, and execution of murder were all based on Liu Luyin's instigation. Even if the instigated person did not commit a crime, or only reached the stage of preparation, for the person instigated to assassinate, except for the executed killing of Chairman Yang, according to Article 19, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Liu Luyin should be considered a attempted offender. However, it is only a case of one instigation act, that is, one act that constitutes several crimes, so he should be charged with one count of instigating murder with the heavier sentence. This court inquires and considers that Liu Luyin has been following Premier Sun since the Xinhai Revolution, engaging in the national revolution. He has repeatedly expressed his admiration for the central leaders during this court's interrogation. The sentencing should be mitigated. The plan is an object used for the crime and should be confiscated.

(6) Regarding Liu Luyin, Cheng Bianchao, Xi Baizhou, Cao Bingrong, and Yang Qixin's participation in a society: According to Article 154 of the Criminal Law, participation in a society with the purpose of committing crimes refers to those who commit unspecified crimes against unspecified persons. If Liu Luyin et al. intended to commit the specific crime of murder and plotted with multiple people, the act of conspiracy has already constituted the crime of instigating murder, so they should not be charged with the crime in the aforementioned article. Regarding this part, they should each be acquitted.

(7) Regarding Li Qunjian: Li Qunjian is Yang Xiaoming's adopted son. Because Yang Xiaoming and his wife have fled without a trace, the defendant was arrested and sent to court. Although he went to Hankou once on October 22nd of last year to find Yang Xiaoming to collect money, he left Hankou the next day. It cannot be proven that he committed any crime, so he should be acquitted.

(8) Regarding Nie Jingquan: Nie Jingquan was acquainted with Fan Qishu. In July of last year, Fan Qishu, using self-defense as an excuse, asked him to introduce him to Wen Maoguan to privately purchase a pistol and twenty bullets for 45 national currency. He has repeatedly confessed. He should be charged with helping to sell military firearms and ammunition without permission. However, the danger and damage caused by his crime are very great, so he should be sentenced to the highest degree of imprisonment for two years. (Unfinished) (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)

Commentary

### The Tremendous Turmoil in the Market

— Ren

Recently, the securities and commodity markets in Shanghai have experienced unpredictable and volatile changes due to manipulation by speculators. On the afternoon of the 8th, the bid prices for public bonds, flour, wheat, yarn, and cotton all surged wildly and excessively. The auction for flour and cotton yarn was even suspended. The intensity of the surge exceeded expectations. By yesterday, the market was even more chaotic. Flour, yarn, and cotton had no choice but to "trade on the blackboard." Wheat also rose to the point of auction suspension. This kind of huge turbulence has only been seen since January 28th. The reasons are varied and inconclusive. Some say it is because the Sino-British loan is difficult to establish and the currency system of our country will change. Others say it is due to the government's public bond policy and that there will be new developments. Rumors and absurdities vary from person to person. They are all the air released by the bulls to "fish in troubled waters." In the future, after the storm passes and the sky clears, it will not be difficult to return to normal. However, at this time when the huge waves are rising, we really cannot remain silent.

The urgent need to suppress today's prices has already been discussed in an article in this newspaper on the 4th. If prices continue to rise, labor unrest will become more widespread, and social stability and order will inevitably be completely destroyed. This has already been stated in our previous article. However, this is still limited to the scenario of slowly rising prices. If there is a wild and excessive surge like the recent two days, the harm will be even greater. It is important to know that China's economy today is in a transitional period. The implementation of the legal tender policy has not been two years. Although the people have gradually gained faith in it, the government still needs to work hard to promote it in the future. Moreover, the important goal at present is to stabilize the currency value. If the currency value is not fixed for a day, the people's faith will not be firm for a day, and the implementation of the legal tender policy will be subject to a heavy obstacle. However, the expression of currency value depends on prices. Whether prices are stable or not indicates the degree of currency value stability. Today's speculative merchants are using the weakness of the legal tender's foundation not being fully consolidated to create rumors and raise prices wildly. Although their private desires are satisfied, the credit of the entire national currency system will inevitably suffer a huge loss. This can be asserted.

Moreover, the wild rise in prices not only affects the credit of the currency system but may even cause the foundation of the currency system to be shaken. As a result of the wild rise in prices, the credit of the currency system is damaged. As a result of market psychology, there will be more and more buyers and prices will rise more and more. As prices rise wildly, currency chips will feel insufficient and more chips will have to be issued. The more chips are issued, the higher prices will be. Rotating and circulating, the foundation of the currency system will be shaken. Therefore, for the future of the currency system, the waterfall-like rise in prices is a heavy obstacle that cannot be ignored.

Furthermore, China today is on the path of economic construction. All aspects require materials, and external aggression is urgent. National defense construction is also fervent. However, in order to take into account the burden on the people, expenditures must be saved as much as possible. Today's excessive surge in prices is harmful to this principle. As a result, the people's burden may be increased due to construction, or construction may be abandoned in order to reduce the people's burden. One of the two must be chosen. If the former is chosen, today's people do not have the capacity. If the latter is chosen, the country's future can be worried about. The fact that prices should not rise wildly is further proven by this.

Although the wild rise in prices in the past two days is due to the manipulation of speculators and may not last, the adverse effects on all aspects in this surge are also very worrying. We deeply hope that the government will quickly seek countermeasures to prevent a spark from becoming a prairie fire. We especially hope that the gentlemen who are manipulating the market today will prioritize the country and the nation, quickly reflect on themselves, and seek a good aftermath.

### Vice President Kong and His Entourage Arrive in Germany and Receive a Warm Welcome

A Strong Atmosphere of Sino-German Friendship: Kong Receives Honorary Doctorate

[Berlin] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, arrived here from Beijing at 8:30 this morning. The station on Wilhelmstrasse was decorated with green and gold flowers and hung with the national flags of China and Germany. German Economics Minister Dr. Schacht and senior officials from various ministries, as well as Chinese Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang and embassy staff, were at the station to welcome them. Accompanying Vice President Kong to Germany were Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, Railway Vice Minister Zeng Rongfu, Secretary-General Weng Wenhao, Army Lieutenant General Gui Yongqing, Navy Rear Admiral Lin Xianxin, etc. When the train entered the station, Chinese overseas Chinese in Germany waved flags and cheered enthusiastically, and the situation was extremely warm. The Chinese embassy's military attache and military officers studying in Germany were all in full dress uniform, reflecting with the German Air Force's blue uniforms, the Army's grey uniforms, and the police's dark blue uniforms, especially eye-catching. After Vice President Kong got off the train, he was accompanied by Dr. Schacht to the station's VIP room. Dr. Schacht immediately delivered a brief welcome speech, expressing his pleasure that Kong had accepted his invitation to visit Germany. Kong also thanked him for his sincere welcome, and said that he would take the opportunity of his visit to promote the friendship between China and Germany. Kong and Schacht then went to the Bristol Hotel together. Vice President Kong will visit the Berlin Institute of Technology at noon today, and the school will present him with an honorary doctorate. (National Maritime Telegraph dispatch, 9th)

[Berlin] After Dr. Kong Xiangxi arrived in Berlin this morning, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Engineering by the President of the Berlin Institute of Technology, Janyim, at noon. Weng Wenhao, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan of China, who received a doctorate from the same school in Nanjing a few months ago, also attended the ceremony. Other observers included General Kittel, representative of the German Ministry of Defense, and senior officials from the Ministry of Education, Foreign Affairs, and Economics. When President Ya awarded the degree, he declared that the school awarded Dr. Kong the doctorate for two reasons: first, for Kong's outstanding success in the national economy, especially for stabilizing the value of Chinese currency in difficult times; second, for Kong's continuous efforts to promote Sino-German friendship, including the implementation of trade agreements. Dr. Kong then gave a reply, expressing his deep gratitude for the awarding of the degree, saying that this seat was completely unexpected, and considered it not only his personal honor, but also a manifestation of the recognition of China on the one hand, and a symbol of the excellent relationship between China and Germany on the other hand. Zha also continued that China, under the rule of General Chiang Kai-shek, has begun a great development, and the entire country is moving towards complete modernization. The development of science and technology urgently needs the assistance of German friends, especially German technical experts. After the ceremony, President Ya Yim and Dean Professor Storm led Vice President Kong to the school's newly completed friendship room for a meal, and Ya introduced Zha to the attendees, calling him a "disciple of Sun Yat-sen," and said that the Germans have always admired his extreme admiration, considering him to be the leader of the Chinese youth movement, and vigorously stated that both China and Germany attach great importance to youth. Kong went to the Technical University this morning to attend the ceremony, and visited Economics Minister Schacht at the National Bank. Schacht then went to the Bristol Hotel in the afternoon to return Kong's visit. (National Maritime Telegraph dispatch, 9th)

(National Maritime Telegraph dispatch, 9th)

### German Press Unanimously Praises

[Berlin] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Executive Yuan of China, will arrive here before noon on the tenth. All newspapers have recently welcomed him with articles. A German general report stated, "Vice President Kong cooperated with his brother-in-law, Jin Ziwen, using Chinese traditional methods and modern financial strategies, to protect the Chinese economy from harm. His merits are very numerous. Looking back to November 1935, after the Chinese Ministry of Finance decided to disassociate the Chinese currency from the silver standard, the general public was shocked, and some people expressed doubts. But the result of the implementation was remarkable, and the masses were convinced." The report also said that Vice President Kong built roads and founded schools in his hometown of Shanxi Province. He came to Germany this time as a representative of China, and we deeply express our respect. Our country and China have close and friendly relations in culture and economy, and both sides have benefited from it. This time, Kong led many military, political, and economic commissioners to come together, and we should take this opportunity to further improve the cooperation between China and Germany in the future.

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Gradually Taking Shape

Yoshida Ambassador Visits Australian Prime Minister to Exchange Views on Pacific Pact

[London] News from informed sources indicates that negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japan regarding Far Eastern issues are gradually becoming more concrete and turning into formal trial negotiations. Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Shigeru Yoshida, previously received instructions from Tokyo to begin formal negotiations with the British Foreign Office at the appropriate time. However, due to the recent change in the Japanese cabinet, it remains to be seen whether these instructions will continue to be effective. Therefore, the negotiations may be temporarily postponed. (Central News Agency, 8th, Havas dispatch)

[London] Regarding the proposal for a Pacific Pact put forward by Australian Prime Minister Lyons, progress has been made today. Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Shigeru Yoshida, recently visited Lyons at his hotel for half an hour. Details of the conversation were not released, but according to Reuters, this was purely exploratory and not of an official nature. It is said that the purpose of Yoshida's visit was to gather Lyons' detailed opinions, and it does not have significant diplomatic implications. The general public attaches great importance to this meeting, believing it to be the first direct contact between Australia and Japan regarding a conference of Pacific powers. Lyons may not formally discuss this matter with the American Ambassador to the UK, Bingham, in London. (However, according to reliable sources, the US government is interested in Australia's proposal.) (Central News Agency, 9th, Reuters dispatch)

[London] Australian Prime Minister Lyons today further explained his "Pacific Locarno" plan to the press. However, it is said that British Foreign Secretary Eden believes that the time is not yet ripe, as the international relations in the Pacific depend on the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations.

### France and Italy Submit Replies to Britain on the Issue of Safety in the Western Mediterranean

Anglo-German Compromise Based on Two Methods; Many Difficulties in Implementing the Plan

[London] According to official sources, the French government's written reply regarding the issue of ensuring the safety of warships from various countries engaged in surveillance work in the Spanish Mediterranean has been delivered to the British Foreign Office. The reply contains two suggestions: ㊀ Dispatching personnel from neutral countries to perform inspection work on the warships of countries participating in surveillance; ㊁ Including all neutral countries in the naval surveillance operations. It is said that the purpose of France's first suggestion is to clarify responsibility in the event of new incidents and to prevent attackers from finding excuses to shirk responsibility. The purpose of the second suggestion is to give the fleets of countries participating in surveillance an international character. These two French suggestions will be submitted to the London Adjustment Committee for discussion in the future. However, if Germany and Italy can resume work with the Adjustment Committee based on the previous suggestions put forward by Britain, then the French government will no longer insist on the above suggestions. (Central News Agency, 8th, Havas dispatch)

[Rome] Regarding the issue of ensuring the safety of warships from countries engaged in surveillance in the Western Mediterranean, the Italian government has sent a note replying to Britain's proposal. It rejects Britain's suggestion that the four countries participating in surveillance (Britain, France, Italy, and Germany) should immediately conduct consultations after the occurrence of new incidents. It demands that the countries participating in surveillance have the right to take retaliatory action independently. After this note was sent, the US Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, visited Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon to inform him of Britain's views on the Italian note. After consultations, it is said that Italy has accepted that consultations should be conducted by the countries participating in surveillance before retaliatory action is taken, but it is necessary to exchange views with Berlin before a final decision can be made. (Central News Agency, 8th, Havas dispatch)

[Rome] Political circles here believe that the reports that Germany and Italy have agreed to rejoin the international surveillance operations are premature. It is said that final agreement is still dependent on the determination of the manner in which warships from countries participating in surveillance can exercise their right to self-defense when attacked. (9th, Kuomintang Maritime News)

[London] According to responsible sources, the British and German governments have reached a compromise based on the following two methods regarding the issue of ensuring the safety of warships from countries engaged in surveillance in the Western Mediterranean: ㊀ When a warship from any country participating in surveillance is infringed upon, the other fleets should act in solidarity and consult with each other; ㊁ Countries participating in surveillance do not abandon their right to self-defense. There are still many difficulties in the implementation procedures of the above plan, so it will take time to adopt it. Italy opposes adopting this plan using normal procedures. The so-called normal procedures are: first, the plan agreed upon by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy is submitted to the Adjustment Committee for discussion and approval; second, the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War are requested to delineate safe zones for the warships participating in surveillance and to respect the safety of these warships. Italy is deeply concerned that once this issue is submitted to the Adjustment Committee for discussion, the Soviet representative may object or raise the issue of responsibility for the bombing of the Port of Almeria, thereby delaying the resolution of this issue. For this reason, Italy advocates that a request should first be made to the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War before submitting it to the Adjustment Committee for discussion. Conversely, the Soviet side believes that the governments of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy have no right to make a request to the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War, and that it should only be done by the Adjustment Committee. It also believes that the Soviet representative definitely intends to raise the issue of responsibility for the bombing of the Port of Almeria in the Adjustment Committee. Since Germany can demand guarantees because of the bombing of the "Deutschland," the Spanish Republican government is justified in demanding guarantees because of the bombing of the Port of Almeria. Although the opinions of both sides are absolutely opposed, the British side hopes to persuade Italy to accept the normal procedures and submit this issue to the Adjustment Committee for discussion first. At the same time, it hopes to persuade the Soviet Union to abandon its original intention and no longer raise the issue of the bombing of the Port of Almeria in the Adjustment Committee and demand compensation from Germany for the damage. In this way, everything can be easily resolved. The British side also believes that the most important thing is to make the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War accept the method of safe zones and respect the safety of the warships from countries participating in surveillance. If this can be achieved, then various guarantees for the warships participating in surveillance are no longer necessary, and the entire issue can be resolved. (Central News Agency, 8th, Havas dispatch)

### Incident of German Warship Being Bombed

German Government Issues Public Statement

[Berlin] Regarding the circumstances of the bombing of the cruiser "Deutschland" by Spanish government aircraft on May 29, the government has issued the following public statement based on a report from the Navy Department: "After the Italian destroyer 'Barletta' was bombed by Valencia government aircraft in the Port of Palma, Mallorca, the 'Deutschland,' in order to avoid incidents, chose the Port of Ibiza as a place to purchase food and anchor. The Spanish Nationalist forces did not use the port as a naval base, and the only warship anchored in the port was the 'Deutschland.' In addition, near the coast of the port were the German naval water tanker 'Neptun' and the German torpedo boat 'Leopard.' At around 7:00 PM on May 29, there were no Nationalist-owned steamers in the Port of Ibiza. The crew of the 'Deutschland' were resting at the time when two bombing aircraft suddenly flew over the 'Deutschland' and dropped to low altitude to bomb. At that time, the 'Deutschland' was at anchor and had the strength to defend itself, but because the reflection of the setting sun was strong, it was difficult to identify the emblems and markings of the two aircraft. It was not until after the bombing was completed that they were identified. The 'Deutschland' and 'Leopard' did not fire a single shot. Also, when the aircraft bombed, the Spanish government cruisers 'Libertad' and 'Méndez Núñez' and four government destroyers were seen on the ocean surface. Only a few minutes after the aircraft bombed, the destroyers opened fire and bombarded the coast of the Port of Ibiza."

### Madrid Continues to Be Bombarded

Casualties Reach 300

Madrid: The areas under the control of the Spanish government were again attacked today by enemy aircraft and artillery, resulting in a large number of deaths, with Madrid being the worst affected. More than one hundred people died and about two hundred were injured, mostly women. The bombardment lasted for an hour and a half, with about four hundred shells falling. The port of Bilbao was attacked from the air, resulting in the deaths of many civilians. However, although the Port of Valencia was also bombed by aircraft, the damage was minor, and there were reportedly no deaths. In addition, the Nationalist cruiser "Canarias" fired on several towns and cities along the northern coast of Barcelona, but according to official sources, there were very few deaths or injuries, and the damage was also minor. (Central News Agency, 8th, Reuters dispatch)

Gibraltar: Two warships sailing without lights fired more than twenty shots at the Nationalist-held Port of Ceuta in Spanish Morocco early this morning. The coastal artillery used searchlights to illuminate the warships and returned fire. (Central News Agency, 9th, Reuters dispatch)

### German-Yugoslav Talks Conclude

Public Statement Issued: Policies of the Two Countries are Approaching; Pro-French Students in Yugoslavia Demonstrate Against Germany

Belgrade: After German Foreign Minister Neurath held talks with Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović for two hours during his visit to Yugoslavia, although he made optimistic remarks to the press, it is difficult to expect the close political cooperation with Yugoslavia that Germany hoped for to succeed. It is said that this cooperation can currently only extend to the economic and cultural aspects. Furthermore, although the German Foreign Minister engaged in frequent socializing with key Yugoslav figures during the day, and the atmosphere on the surface was extremely harmonious, in the evening, hundreds of Yugoslav Jewish students gathered to hold a large-scale demonstration, shouting slogans such as "Down with Hitler," "Down with Fascism," "Long live France," and "Long live Democracy," which was enough to make the German guest feel uneasy. The demonstration was later dispersed by the police, and many people were arrested. The remarks issued by the German Foreign Minister today stated that various issues of mutual interest between the two countries had been discussed, and that the visit indicated that the policy goals of the two countries were similar and would make an important contribution to the peace of Europe. Neurath also presented the Grand Cross of the German Eagle Order to the Yugoslav Prime Minister today, and Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, the Regent, presented the White Eagle Order, First Class, to Neurath and invited him to a small banquet. (Central News Agency, 9th, Reuters dispatch)

[Paris] Regarding the visit of German Foreign Minister Neurath to the capital of Yugoslavia, the newspaper L'Ordre recently published an article by the famous journalist Madame Tabouis, stating that the negotiations between Germany and Yugoslavia concern the establishment of a permanent German-Yugoslav Economic Committee, which will become the central agency for Germany's future purchases of grain. All of Germany's purchases of grain from Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary can be handled through this committee. As for the political aspect, the talks conducted by Neurath with the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović have not been able to resolve most issues. This depends on the success or failure of the efforts made by Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck in Central European countries, especially in Hungary. The Paris Echo stated that the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović may follow in the footsteps of Polish Foreign Minister Beck in 1934 and sacrifice relations with Czechoslovakia and Austria in order to seek respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of his country. This can be known without Stojadinović's announcement. (Central News Agency, 9th, Havas dispatch)

### British Financial Times Discusses China's Economic Progress

[London] The Financial Times recently commented on the prospects for Chinese securities and mentioned the relationship between China and Japan, stating that "Japan is now changing its policy towards China, which leads one to expect the possibility of further understanding between the two sides, and it is believed that if China proceeds with international borrowing, Japan may also be one of the lending countries. Even if the change in Japan's attitude is disregarded, the progress made by China in finance and economy in the past two years is enough to make holders of Chinese securities happy. The main content of the talks recently conducted in London by Dr. H.H. Kung, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, is to discuss the possibility of new international borrowing. This borrowing is used to promote the economic recovery and industrial development plan led by General Chiang Kai-shek. The scope of authority of the Nanjing government is now expanding daily, so the railways in most provinces are already under the control of the Nanjing government, and the operating conditions of the railways have also improved in recent years. The Ministry of Railways has been able to formulate a plan to reorganize old debts. For this reason, if investors who specialize in taking risks and hoarding goods keep Chinese securities in their safe deposit boxes in the future, they can be assured of no losses."

### Japanese Government Decides to Implement Centralized Gold Policy

Controlling National Gold Production Industry; Urgently Seeking to Deal with Trade Deficit

[Tokyo] Because foreign trade has increased the number of import surpluses since the second half of last year, resulting in a greater increase in payments to foreign countries, a large amount of cash has been transported to the United States. It is also planned to continue transporting cash to the United States in the future. Therefore, the amount of cash that the government will transport to the United States this year exceeds the amount of cash purchased and received by the Bank of Japan. The Ministry of Finance fears that this phenomenon will be inconvenient for the government's cash transportation in the future. It has decided to implement a compulsory cash purchase method for the Gold Production Management Law in a special diet. The important points of the law are as follows:

㊀ Order gold producers to sell their gold to the Bank of Japan,

㊁ Strictly supervise gold producers to prevent the dissipation of newly produced gold,

㊂ But the market trading in gold remains free,

The current Bank of Japan's cash purchase law designates a certain gold producer to sell its gold to the Bank of Japan, and other gold producers are not bound by this law and can trade with anyone. However, the gold production management law decided to be implemented by the government forces all gold producers to trade with the Bank of Japan in order to strengthen the centralized gold policy. The quantity of gold produced in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan that the government and the Bank of Japan have purchased has always been as shown in the statistical table below, accounting for 62% to 84% of the total output.

In 1932, gold production was 23.014 kilograms,

The actual amount received by the government and the Bank of Japan was 15.812 kilograms, 68%. In 1933, gold production was 25.888 kilograms,

The amount purchased by the government and the Bank of Japan was 19.887 kilograms, 76%.

In 1934, gold production was 28.577 kilograms,

The amount purchased by the government and the Bank of Japan was 17.823 kilograms, 60%.

In 1935, gold production was 34.189 kilograms,

The amount purchased by the government and the Bank of Japan was 28.295 kilograms, 82%.

The remaining gold that the government did not purchase was used for industrial or decorative purposes, and its quantity only accounted for 20% or 30% of the total gold production. Therefore, the quantity obtained as a result of the government's implementation of the gold production management law to force the purchase of gold may not reach a huge amount. However, the government authorities hold the following views:

㊀ After the implementation of the gold production management law, the cash that has been dissipated everywhere through private transportation or other methods is concentrated in the Bank of Japan. There are special conveniences for investigating cash, and the amount of cash controlled by the government and the Bank of Japan can be increased. ㊁ As a result of forcing all gold producers to report in detail the amount of gold they produce and other matters, the government understands the current situation of the Japanese gold production industry and can observe its future. Therefore, a reasonable gold policy can be determined. ㊂ After the government investigates the actual situation of the gold production industry, it implements the rationalization of the gold refining industry and technical assistance for dealing with inferior ore, so that the Gold Production Promotion Law can be effective.

The government intends to temporarily take the above points as its goal, implement the gold production management law, and after observing the situation, restrict the use of gold for purposes other than currency. (9th, Allied News)

### World Gold Production Statistics

### Finance Minister Kaya Plans to Compile a Five-Year Industrial Plan

[Tokyo] Chugai Business News today reported that Finance Minister Kaya and Sun plan to compile a five-year industrial plan, requiring an expenditure of 2,250,000,000 yen. (Central News Agency, 9th, Reuters dispatch)

[Tokyo] "Manchukuo" established a five-year gold production plan last year in order to achieve a leap in industrial development. The newly appointed Japanese Finance Minister Kaya has always advocated a common economic plan between Japan and "Manchukuo." If Japan establishes a unified Japan-"Manchukuo" industrial five-year plan, then the Manchukuo industrial five-year plan is also an important component of it. Therefore, Japan attaches great importance to the content of the Manchukuo industrial plan. (9th, Allied News)

### Japanese Cabinet Decides to Establish Ministry of Health

Improving National Physique Considered Urgent; Special Diet Scheduled to Convene on July 23

[Tokyo] The Konoe Cabinet this morning passed the proposal by Army Minister Sugiyama Gen to establish a Ministry of Health. This is another plan of the military's national mobilization policy that has been adopted by the government. The establishment of the Ministry of Health was previously requested by former Army Minister Terauchi Hisaichi a year ago. The decline in the physical condition of the Japanese people, as well as the demands of a higher level of national defense, necessitate the establishment of a national health organization. According to the proposal put forward by the Army, the new ministry will include ten bureaus and thirty-six sections. Prime Minister Konoe has instructed the Planning Board to draft appropriate legislation and submit it to the next Diet session. The Army Ministry's proposed amendment to the Conscription Law aims to allow young people with mild myopia and partial deafness to be drafted into the army. The bill was submitted for discussion at the last Diet session along with twenty-four other bills, but none were passed. The Cabinet meeting today decided to submit this bill to the next Diet session for review. The Cabinet meeting this morning also decided to convene a special Diet session on July 23, lasting for two weeks. (9th, Central News Agency dispatch)

[Tokyo] Regarding the issue of the establishment of the Ministry of Health, the Planning Board is currently studying and drafting a draft proposal. Therefore, the Ministry of Home Affairs has also decided to proceed with the concrete draft proposal obtained through independent investigation and research, and submit it to the Planning Board as important reference material. The proposal of the Ministry of Home Affairs is drafted on the premise of unifying the health, hygiene, and medical institutions currently dispersed among various ministries and establishing a strong central agency. The institutions to be merged are:

㊀ All of the Health Bureau under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and all of the Social Bureau (this is based on a broad perspective of health and hygiene), ㊁ All of the school health and physical education facilities under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, ㊂ The medical and utilization cooperative societies under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, ㊃ The postal life insurance agency of the Ministry of Communications,

Other institutions, such as the medical affairs bureaus of the Army and Navy, are not included because they are special agencies. The medical institutions organized by employees of the Ministry of Railways and Communications are also not included under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health and are allowed to become autonomous systems. In short, the intention of the Ministry of Home Affairs is to use the establishment of this unified agency to enrich the facilities for national health and hygiene and to improve the general physique of the people. (9th, Allied News)

[Tokyo] At today's cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Konoe proposed that Foreign Minister Hirota concurrently serve as President of the Planning Board, which was unanimously approved by all cabinet members. (9th, Allied News)

### Observing the Solar Eclipse in the South Pacific

American Team Achieves Excellent Results; Photographs Corona's Various Colors

[Washington] Today's solar eclipse was observed by the American Geographical Society and the U.S. Navy expedition on Canton Island in the Pacific Ocean.  According to a telegram from team member Dr. L.J. Briggs, the observations were very good. During the total eclipse, the light intensity was approximately half that of a full moon. Many scientists had previously believed that the light intensity during a solar eclipse would not be so weak. This solar eclipse was visible within 5,000 miles of the Pacific Ocean, with Canton Island having the most advantageous viewing position. The island of Enderbury in Peru, however, was unsuitable for observation due to the sun being too low. The American expedition chose Canton Island, which belongs to the Phoenix Islands, located 1,800 miles southwest of the Hawaiian Islands and 2,000 miles northeast of Australia. The Phoenix Islands are all coral islands with low terrain. Although under British territory, there are no permanent residents. The American observation team's scientific arrangements were very thorough this time. The duration of the observed eclipse was four minutes and eight seconds, with totality occurring at noon. The observers focused on the solar corona (i.e., the ring of light surrounding the celestial body, which can only be seen during a total solar eclipse) and the chromosphere (i.e., the incandescent gas surrounding the sun), and took "spectral" photographs to study how high the water vapor emitted by the solar sphere can rise. The organizer of the team was Dr. Briggs, director of the research group of the American Geographical Society, and the team leader was Dr. Mitchell, director of the astronomical observatory at the University of Virginia. Mitchell was responsible for taking the spectral photographs. The "spectra were acquired when the moon had completely obscured the sun and just before the sun gradually emerged from behind the moon by a few seconds. Personnel from the U.S. Navy were led by Commander Hurlburt, director of the U.S. Naval Observatory. Other participants included Dr. McNally, director of the Georgetown Observatory, and Dr. Curtis, director of the University of Michigan Observatory. Curtis was in charge of observing the corona, while McNally took photographs of the various colors of the corona using various filters. (National Telegram, 8th)

### A Certain Party Sends More Aircraft and Armored Vehicles to Chahar North

Striving to Suppress the People's Spirit in Chahar North; Confiscating the Property of Righteous People's Leaders; People in Jehol Also Rise to Join the Righteous Cause

Wan Quan Dispatch: Since the people of various places rose up to defend themselves, a certain party, seeing the surging people's spirit, is now urgently seeking to suppress it. According to a dispatch from Jiabusi, at around 11:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, a certain party sent eight fighter planes and nine armored vehicles from Jehol to Jiabusi, intending to suppress the people. On the same day, two important officials from a certain party, carrying orders from the Kwantung Army Headquarters, arrived in Jiabusi by plane from Jehol. They immediately summoned the personnel of the Special Service Agency and the leaders of the puppet bandit army and administration to convey the orders and jointly discuss implementation measures. De Wang also rushed from West Sunite Banner by plane to participate. It is reported that the most important measure to be implemented immediately was to assign one person from a certain ethnicity to each bandit and puppet army officer above the rank of regimental commander in order to monitor them at all times. Special attention and strict supervision will be given to the actions of Chinese people serving in the puppet political organs in the future. After the meeting, the two important officials listened to the report from the head of the Special Service Agency on the true situation of the popular uprisings in various parts of Chahar North. On the morning of the 3rd, they flew back to Changchun by the original plane.

Zhao Xiangchun, the leader of the righteous people in Tao Miao Village (i.e., Toragai Temple), withdrew from the village at 3:00 AM on the 3rd and hid in various nearby mountain villages. He is still secretly active, contacting comrades, and attempting to rise again. It is reported that many people are responding, and his influence is quite strong, which has made him even more hated by a certain party. They have now ordered the puppet Chongli County Office to confiscate all the fields and other properties of Zhao Xiangchun and others, and sent people to Tao Miao Village to suppress everything. Furthermore, the puppet Chongli County Office, considering that the current location of the county office is not strategically important and fearing that it would be difficult to defend in case of an incident, decided on the 3rd to move to Xiwancun Village in the county, and began working on the 4th. According to a dispatch from Shangdu, after the popular uprising on the evening of the 1st of this month was suppressed by the puppet army, a certain party discovered that Yin Baoshan's troops stationed there were colluding with the people and arrested many people. On the morning of the 3rd, one platoon leader, two soldiers, and one plainclothes detective related to the people were executed by firing squad outside the north gate of Shangdu. According to news from Duolun, since the people of Chahar North have risen up to defend themselves, a delegation of people, numbering over a thousand, was discovered in the Susuqi'er area northwest of Chifeng County in Jehol. On the 2nd of this month, they surrounded and disarmed the local police and security teams, shouting the slogan "Recover the Lost Territory of Jehol" and preparing to advance eastward within days.

### An Overview of the Current Judicial Situation in Fujian Province

— Remarkable Achievements in the Past Three Years —

Fuzhou Dispatch: Since Tong Hangshi took charge of the judiciary in this province, there has been annual progress. Here is a record of the situation in the past two years:

(1) Case Resolution: In recent years, cases in Fujian Province, whether civil or criminal, have been put on track. According to statistics, the number of cases resolved in the 24th and 25th years of the Republic has increased by more than 10,000 compared to the 22nd and 23rd years. (2) Establishment of County Judicial Offices: Over the past year, judicial offices have been established in succession in Fuqing, Xianyou, Lianjiang, Fuan, Xiapu, Nanping, Changting, Shanghang, Longyan, Shaowu, Pucheng, Yongchun, Huian, Nan'an, Anxi, Tongan, Zhangpu, Zhao'an, Changtai, Gutian, Pingxi, Ningde, Wuping, Liancheng, Jianyang, Nanjing, Yunxiao, and Haicheng, a total of 28 counties. The remaining counties will also be established by the end of June of this year, so the entire province's judiciary will be completely separated from the administration and become independent. (3) Construction and Repair of Prisons: The prisons in various parts of Fujian were extremely dilapidated, and escapes were frequent. Therefore, in the past two years, the detention centers of the Fuzhou, Jian'ou, Jinjiang, and other local courts, as well as the old prisons of Pucheng, Nan'an, Fuqing, Fuan, Lianjiang, Yong'an, Haicheng, Zhangping, Chong'an, Jianyang, Youxi, Jianning, and Luoyuan counties, have been repaired. In addition, a new Fujian Third Prison has been built in Xiamen, and a new prison infirmary has been added to the Fujian First Prison in Fuzhou. Recently, the construction of the First New Prison in the provincial capital and the Fourth New Prison in Jian'ou has been planned. (4) Repair of Court Buildings: The court buildings in Fujian are all old and dilapidated and in danger of collapsing. In the past two years, a large auditorium and two large courtrooms have been rebuilt in the High Court, as well as a guard room (three rooms), the main and second gates, the president's office, the chief prosecutor's office, the waiting room, the offices of various departments, and halls, pavilions, gardens, and toilets. The inspection of the waiting area of the local court, the Jinjiang Local Court, and the fourth branch of the High Court has been supervised. The Longxi Local Court, concurrently the Third Branch of the High Court, and the Xiamen Local Court and the First Branch of the High Court have been relocated. Now, the addresses of the courts throughout the province have been completely renovated. In addition, active measures have been taken in areas such as inspection work, training prison guards, and supervising subordinates. Therefore, the achievements of the Fujian judiciary are obvious and are recognized by all sectors.

### Flooding of the Min River Causes Disaster in Fuzhou

Water Depth in the Southwestern District of the City Reaches Five Feet; Villages Along the River Are Submerged to the Roofs

Fuzhou Dispatch: Since mid-May, the Min River basin has been plagued by continuous rain, causing the river to swell and overflow onto the plains on May 29th, resulting in a flood disaster. By June 1st, the rain continued, and the water level rose further. The low-lying streets and alleys in the southwestern districts of Fuzhou were flooded, with water depths ranging from one foot to over five feet. All public buses were suspended, and people mostly took refuge upstairs. The Public Security Bureau and the Public Works Department dispatched security teams and engineering teams to rescue people by boat. At the same time, various charitable organizations prepared to provide porridge relief, as the low-lying areas, such as Wenzao, Yiqian Bridge, Micangqian, Sanxianzhou, Chating'an, and Shuibu Street, are mostly inhabited by poor people. Once a flood occurs, they cannot work or trade, and their livelihoods are completely cut off. In the suburbs of Fuzhou, the water level in the southwestern villages along the Min River is even higher than in the city. Areas such as Baoping, Jingtu, Ge Yu, Pan Yu, Tai Yu, Yi Yu, Wu Yu, Yang Qi, Huaian, Puxia, Huxi, Wu Shan, Jinjiang, Gang Dun, Ma Rong Neihu, Waihu, and over a hundred other villages have water depths of over ten feet on the plains, submerging the roofs. The riverbanks are indistinguishable, forming a vast expanse of water. The normal early rice crop, which was about to ripen, was swept away, resulting in even greater losses. The steamships traveling between Fuzhou and the upstream areas of the Min River, such as Shuikou, Yanping, Jian'ou, Sha County, and Minqing, have also been suspended due to the high water levels, completely cutting off transportation between the provincial capital and northern Fujian. In addition, most of the rafts of pine and fir wood that were being transported downstream from Ge Bei were also washed away, and timber merchants will have to send people to various ports in the southwest to redeem them after the water recedes.

It is known that Fuzhou usually experiences one or two floods every year in May or June. This is because the downstream channel of the Min River, from Hongjiang in the western suburbs of Fuzhou, through Taijiang in the southern suburbs, to Majiang at the mouth of the sea, is too curved. As a result, the sand and gravel carried downstream by the river accumulate along the way, making the channel shallower and impeding the flow of water. Therefore, once the late spring and early summer bring heavy rains and high water levels, the channel cannot accommodate the water and overflows onto the plains, causing floods, sometimes even two or three times in a season. The Water Conservancy Bureau planned this spring to build a stone dam about 50 li long on both banks from Hongjiang Huaian to Luozhou in Taijiang to straighten the channel and deepen it. The water from the upstream of the Min River can then flow straight down and directly into the sea, and sediment will not be trapped along the way. The section from Yiyu to Luozhou is already under construction. It is hoped that after the stone dam is built, the flooding in Fuzhou can be reduced. (June 2nd)

### Twists and Turns in the Negotiation of the Shantou Aoyama Case

Negotiations Stall Twice; The Japanese Side Is Uncompromising and Lacks Sincerity in Resolving the Issue

Shantou Dispatch: In the case of the Japanese Aoyama's assault in Shantou, the facts and evidence have been clearly investigated by both sides, and a solution could have been forcefully sought through diplomatic channels. However, the person in charge of the negotiations on the Japanese side, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Torpedo Squadron, Kuma Masayoshi, is brutal and unreasonable. He insists on achieving the demands made in the protest letter of the 27th, requiring the Shantou Municipal Government to punish the police officers who were carrying out their duties, provide compensation and apology, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Our authorities have immediately rejected this and are responding calmly. On the afternoon of the 31st, Shantou Mayor Huang Bingxun, accompanied by Ling Shifen and Huang Jing, went to the Shenzhou Trading Company on the second floor with Japanese Consul Yamazaki Seiichi, Japanese Police Chief Ide Kiyomi, Secretary Obata, and others to investigate and verify Aoyama's statements, which were completely consistent. That evening, both sides held a negotiation meeting on the third floor of the municipal government. They debated fiercely over legal and sovereign rights until dawn without reaching a resolution. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, the debate continued. Our side made the following points: 1. The household registration system implemented in Shantou, requiring certificates for moving in and out, was announced in the 17th year of the Republic by Mayor Huang Kaishan, and implemented by Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang Wodong. This prevents criminals from mixing in the city and greatly improves public order. This household registration law exists in Japan and modern countries and is the most effective law for maintaining public order. 2. The government's implementation of administrative orders is a right that an independent country should have. Notices have been repeatedly sent to the consuls of various countries, and overseas residents of various countries have reported their movements in accordance with the law. This has been done consistently, and the Japanese consul has neither denied it nor raised any objections. 3. The local government has repeatedly sent letters to the Japanese consul, requesting them to report the residential addresses of Japanese citizens in Shantou so that they can be protected. The Japanese side has neither reported them nor replied with the reasons for not reporting. 4. A very small number of Japanese residents in Shantou have reported their household registrations in accordance with the law, but the numbers are mostly untrue. It is reasonable and appropriate to conduct a careful investigation. 5. The Chinese police were assaulted by Aoyama, who did not wear a uniform or badge, while performing their duties. He was naturally regarded as an ordinary resident. Chinese police officers wear uniforms customized by the state and are public officials. Aoyama's assault on our public officials is illegal, and it is necessary to arrest him. 6. The police are not a diplomatic agency. It is proper procedure to detain a foreign criminal, interrogate them clearly, transfer them to the municipal government, and have the consul extradite them back for processing. The police station cannot privately release them on bail, which is only reasonable. 7. Aoyama's assault on the police officer is proven by clear evidence, and the injured party has a medical certificate. Aoyama should be punished, the injured party's medical expenses should be compensated, and it should be guaranteed that similar incidents will not occur in the future, infringing on our country's local administrative sovereignty. The reasons given by the Japanese side are based on the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, which states that Japanese citizens have the freedom to reside and trade in treaty ports. They also claim that our investigation of immigration certificates is inappropriate and that the failure to immediately hand Aoyama over to the Japanese consul for bail is insulting. They also said that Aoyama was also injured and was innocently arrested and humiliated. These are one-sided reasons from the Japanese side. Moreover, at this time, the Japanese side added the Matsukaze, Harukaze, Hatakaze, and Asakaze warships to Shantou to threaten us. Each ship has 120 marines. It is rumored that the Japanese side believes that the Aoyama incident is still minor and does not want Japanese citizens in China to have to report their movements and household registrations everywhere in the future. Therefore, they decided to take a tough stance. On the morning of the 4th, both sides negotiated at the municipal government again. During the meeting, the Japanese side strongly stated that although Aoyama's assault on the police was indeed a fact, since the police had arbitrarily invaded the residence of a citizen, Aoyama had no choice but to take legitimate self-defense measures. They said that the police officers tied up and escorted Aoyama, and then inflicted a beating on him, and that the police station did not stop it in an appropriate manner, which was extremely inappropriate. Our side also presented all the evidence and strongly refuted their absurdity. At around 10:00 AM, they dispersed without reaching a conclusion again. After the Japanese personnel left the municipal government, the Japanese consul submitted a request to the municipal government in writing, stating that: 1. Shantou Mayor Huang Bingxun should express regret for this unfortunate incident and personally apologize. 2. Police Chief Xue Hanyou, Chief Inspector Chen Bingyi, and Second Branch Chief Lu Junya, who mishandled the matter, should be immediately dismissed from their positions. 3. The Shantou Municipal Government should provide a written guarantee to the Japanese Consulate that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Our side immediately rejected these counter-demands. At present, the Japanese side has no sincerity in resolving the issue, and negotiations have become a stalemate. Ling Shifen returned to the province on the 5th to report, and Jizhu also returned to the province on the same day. This case may be transferred to the provincial authorities for handling.

### Changzhou

Major Fire in Xiying Lane

Xiying Lane in Wuyi County is the busiest market. Unfortunately, at 0:20 AM this morning (9th), a fire suddenly broke out at the Dingwuxiang Hardware Store. In an instant, the flames soared, and the heat was fierce, causing the fire to spread to the neighboring Yongchang Coffin Store, Zhou Wanxing Grocery Store, opposite Limin Coffin Factory, Huaxin Leather Hat Store, and Rattan Chair Store, a total of five stores.

Mr. Li's Report

Mr. Li Zhaohuan reported the significance of holding this exhibition, saying, "In addition to seeing the greatness of the Soviet Federal Republic politically, we also see the progress in its various constructions and cultural undertakings. Its various facilities are worthy of admiration by our people. Since the 1917 revolution, the Soviet government has spared no effort to protect children's health and education. The significance of this is a vital path to national strength. Now our association is holding a three-day public exhibition of hundreds of photos of maternal and child protection from that country, thanks to the YMCA for providing the venue. Although this is only a very small part, its significance is far-reaching."

Ambassador Bogomolov's Speech

Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov continued with a speech, saying, "Today, hundreds of photos of our country's achievements in maternal and child protection are on public display here. I have three points about this: ㊀ In the Soviet Union, men and women are equal, and women serve society like men. Therefore, the government is fully responsible for the education of children, so that women can still serve society with peace of mind. ㊀ The significance of educating children is more important than anything else. Children are the future masters of the country, so protecting children is protecting national strength. ㊂ The Sino-Soviet Cultural Association's organization of this event is not only a simple introduction to our country's achievements in protecting children, but also of special importance to the friendship and culture between China and the Soviet Union." Next, Zhou Junshang and Lu Ganchen of the Special Education Committee of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association gave speeches, generally saying that this exhibition was a first in Shanghai. Although the scale was not large, the significance was far-reaching. At about 7 p.m., photos were taken and the meeting dispersed.

Exhibition Period of Three Days

The exhibition is located in the east hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, with thousands of various photos, divided into ㊀ discussion of abortion bans, ㊂ various charts of maternity hospitals, ㊂ charts of maternal and child medical care, ㊃ charts of nurseries (including infant rooms and mobile nursery cars), ㊄ charts of kindergartens, ㊅ charts of children's seasonal playgrounds (including children's resorts), ㊆ charts of women participating in national economic construction, ㊇ education charts, ㊈ charts on women's participation in politics, ㊉ marriage registration and sports charts, etc. The exhibition is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, for three days, closing on the 11th.

### More Than Three Million in Income Tax Has Been Collected in This City

Negotiations on foreign income tax are underway　Business income tax is still under investigation

When the Ministry of Finance began collecting income tax in October last year, it requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform the embassies of various countries in China to inform foreigners to comply. Later, because several countries expressed objections, the Ministry of Finance requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue negotiations. Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance in this city, the collection of income tax from foreigners must be implemented in our country, but because the right of consular jurisdiction exists, it will inevitably be somewhat obstructive. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still continuing negotiations, so whether it can proceed smoothly in the future depends on our efforts. The income tax in this city has reached more than three million yuan, and the payers are for salaries and deposit interest. Business income tax is still under investigation. The Ministry of Finance has established income tax offices in 22 places across the country. The Income Tax Affairs Office in this city recruited a total of 15 instructors for the training class on the 2nd of this month and will assign them to work in various districts of this city within days. The 10 alternates will be fully recruited because income tax is still in its initial stage and there is a great need for talent.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Develop International Routes, the Pu'an to Open a Xiamen-Philippines Route

Consulting with the Ministry of the Navy to purchase and use　The Yichang-Chongqing route is determined to be restored

Since the maiden voyage of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xiamen-Philippines liner Haiheng, the results have been excellent during the trial period. The monthly ticket and freight revenue can reach 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. This route industry has always been dominated by the British merchant Taizhan's Anqing ship. Since the Haiheng started sailing, the overseas Chinese in Xiamen and the Philippines, motivated by patriotism, have all changed to take the national ship, which has made the Haiheng ship feel a lack of cabin space and insufficient supply. Because the structure of the Haiheng is not very suitable for the Xiamen-Philippines route, the bureau consulted with the Ministry of the Navy to purchase the Ministry's transport ship Pu'an for use in order to develop international shipping and improve the use of ships. During Liu Hongsheng's tenure, the ship was rented to operate summer routes to Qingdao, Putuo, and other places. The ship has a load capacity of 5,500 tons and a large number of passenger seats, and it is extremely beautiful and spacious, making it most suitable for sailing to Xiamen and the Philippines. It is said that negotiations have been completed and that it is temporarily rented. Because the trial voyage period of the Haiheng is about to expire, the bureau will send the Pu'an ship to Xiamen and the Philippines to take over the regular voyage and is currently preparing everything, it is said.

It is also heard that since the Emei ship ran aground, the company has temporarily suspended the Sichuan River route due to the lack of ships to dispatch. Now the Sichuan River shipping industry is quite developed and has planned to resume operation. The Hankou-Yichang route will be operated by the Kuaili and Datong ships, the Shanghai-Yichang route will be operated by the Jiangjing ship, and shallow-water river ships will be built at the same time at the Jiangnan Shipyard in order to operate the Yichang-Chongqing route. The first ship, Jinjiang, is scheduled to be launched on the 26th, and the Yichang-Chongqing route will be restored as soon as it is completed, it is said.

### The Ministry of Transportation Approved the Eurasia Route from Beiping to Hong Kong

Scheduled to start sailing next month, it will take 10 hours to reach　A new route for Sino-German shipping will be tested

The Eurasia Aviation Corporation is planning to open a long-distance route between Beiping and Hong Kong in order to seek international through transport with British Airways. It has been approved by the Ministry of Transportation and is scheduled to officially open in early July. The Sino-German air transport plan has also recently been drawn up with a new route, which will be tested soon. Our reporter has made a special trip to report the details as follows:

Opening a Long-Distance Route from Beiping to Hong Kong

According to the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, the company has planned to open a long-distance route directly from Beiping to Hong Kong in order to expand its business and facilitate air transport. The plan has been carefully planned for four months and is now ready. Yesterday, it was approved by the Ministry of Transportation to open the route. The British government authorities in Hong Kong have also recently allowed the company's aircraft to land in Hong Kong, and everything is no longer a problem. The flight route has been decided to follow the company's original Ping-Yue route and then extend from Yue to the Hong Kong station, connecting with the British Airways route, so that the Eurasia Company's Sino-European route can be connected with the British route before it is opened.

Officially Opened in Early July

After the Eurasia Company contacted all parties, the route has been officially scheduled to open in early July. It is generally stipulated that one flight will be opened each week. The detailed schedule and flight times, etc., will be officially announced within days. The route from Ping to Hong Kong is as long as 2,360 kilometers. The Eurasia Company has decided to configure the large twin-engine Junkers aircraft on this route, although the test flight will be carried out in mid-month. Each flight will take about 10 hours to reach, so after the opening of the route, it will be the longest of the existing civil aviation routes in our country.

Three New Radio Stations Added

The Eurasia Company has fully equipped the stations in Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, and Hankou for the opening of the Ping-Gang route. Recently, it has set up three new radio stations in Changsha, Chenzhou, and Guangzhou. The airport equipment in the above-mentioned places has also been prepared. Recently, the Eurasia Company also plans to add a staff dormitory at Longhua Airport, with various facilities such as a dining hall.

New Plan for Sino-German Air Transport

Also, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Sino-German air transport plan has been prepared for a long time. China's various obstacles have prevented it from being realized so far. According to reliable sources, the Eurasia Company authorities, in view of the importance of Sino-German and Eurasian air transport, in order to realize it as soon as possible, have recently proposed a new route. After consultations with all parties, there is sufficient hope for realization. Currently, only the technical part remains, because a certain segment of the new route in the plan, flying from the Chinese border to the European border, requires a non-stop flight of more than 2,000 kilometers due to the high mountains and ridges along the way. If the difficulty of this segment of the route can be solved, direct Sino-European air transport can be realized. The German Lufthansa Company has prepared a large aircraft suitable for long-distance flights for this purpose and is scheduled to test flight in August and September of this year. It is expected to test flight three times. If the results are good, the Sino-German air transport, which has been suspended for several years, can be resolved.

### Workers from America and Asia Silk Weaving Factories Petitioned Yesterday

Presented four demands　Workers did not disperse until late

The labor unrest in the silk weaving factories in this city has been going on for a long time. After the Social Affairs Bureau ruled on the handling methods, the labor and management sides violated the principles, making it difficult for the bureau to handle the situation. In order to seek an urgent solution, five of the radical elements of the labor unrest were arrested and brought to justice. Unexpectedly, at about 11 a.m. yesterday, more than a thousand workers from the America and Asia and other factories went to the City Party Headquarters to petition, presenting four demands: ㊀ Release the arrested worker representatives, ㊁ Revoke the arrest warrant, ㊂ Require the factory to accept the handling methods ruled by the Social Affairs Bureau and open the factory immediately, ㊃ Require party and government agencies to transfer the factory to maintain workers' food. After Mr. Zhang replied, the two items of releasing the arrested workers and canceling the arrest warrant must be investigated for the truth before they can be reviewed and handled. The City Party Headquarters is responsible for working with the Social Affairs Bureau to handle the issues of starting work and providing relief. However, the workers were not satisfied, so they still lingered outside the City Party Headquarters until about 7 p.m. The order was very good. The City Police Department was on high alert. In addition to the iron nets placed at the entrance of the bureau and at the intersection of Penglai Road, a large number of machine bicycles and more than a hundred reserve teams were also dispatched to maintain order in the worker teams, and two red guard vehicles were dispatched to park at the entrance of the City Party Headquarters to prevent accidents from happening.

The New Life Co., Ltd. of this city applied to the Ministry of Industry for exclusive rights to manufacture rayon and cellophane products within this city for five years, starting from May 1, 1935. As the company failed to commence production according to the scheduled date, despite repeated urging from the ministry, and two years have passed since the approval date (ending April 30th of this year) without any production, the exclusive rights have been revoked in accordance with the second provision of Article 9 of the Industrial Encouragement Law.

### Activities of the Japanese Economic Circle: Katsuji Uchida Arrives in Shanghai

Katsuji Uchida, a director of the Japanese Toyo Colonization Company, has arrived in Shanghai. His aim is to unite with financial and business circles of Japan in China to promote Japan's economic endeavors along the Yangtze River. Since the increased investment in the Japanese Shanghai Bank, short-term loans have been liberally extended to various shipping and steamer companies. Consequently, Japanese shipping companies in China have recently been secretly lowering prices, citing the rising water levels of the Yangtze River, in order to compete with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Jardine Matheson and Company, and Butterfield & Swire. Uchida also plans to explore short-distance shipping routes in northern China. The Sino-Japanese Trade Association hosted a banquet for Uchida at the International Hotel last night at 7 p.m.

### Japanese Consulate General Reports on Korean Independence Leaders

Mr. Zheng Possesses Theoretical and Practical Experience – Japanese Consulate General Suddenly Arrests Him on the 8th

According to the Japanese-language "Daily News," the violent activists in the Korean national independence movement and the anarchist and communist movements have recently been successively reported and detained by the Second Section of the Police Department of the Consulate General. The number of Koreans detained has reached ten, and they will soon be deported to the Korean Governor-General's Office. As a result, secret activities in this city have been greatly panicked. Unexpectedly, there are still stubborn remnants secretly plotting action. Namely, Mr. Zheng, a leader of the national movement, was tasked with rebuilding the movement and forming a strong underground organization. He secretly came to Shanghai from Nanjing. The matter was discovered by the police station of the Consulate General, and he was suddenly arrested on the 8th in a certain place in the city. After interrogation by the police station, it was learned that Mr. Zheng has considerable long-term experience in both theory and practice, and has a major mission in the future.

### Guangdong Commercial Inspection Delegation Passes Through Shanghai from Qingdao to Hangzhou

A delegation of twelve members of the Guangdong Provincial Commercial Inspection Group, led by Mr. Tan Guohua, departed from Guangdong at the beginning of last month and followed the Yuehan Railway to Hankou. Along the way, they inspected the tung oil production and rice market conditions in Hunan and Hubei provinces, and visited major factories. They then proceeded to inspect the commerce of Wuhu and Nanjing. Later, they traveled by train to Pingjin, Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao. It is learned that the delegation arrived in Shanghai on the Desheng wheel a few days ago from Qingdao. The delegation toured the city center and various famous areas the day before yesterday, and was scheduled to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train to Hangzhou yesterday afternoon. They will stay in Hangzhou for about two days, and then return to Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and other places for inspection, returning south on the 17th.

### Speculative Fever in Cotton Yarn: Negotiations Between Bulls and Bears

Bears Suspend Payment of 10 Million Yuan Security Deposit – Negotiations Ongoing, Trading Halted

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market created another strange phenomenon. During the eight trading sessions of the morning and afternoon, a certain large bull operator was particularly aggressively absorbing, but no one was selling. As a result, no transactions were made in all eight sessions. The near-term cotton yarn for the current month rose to 295 yuan, and the total amount of security deposit that the bears should have paid reached over 10 million yuan. Yesterday morning, the payment should have been made to the exchange as usual, but the bear traders in the industry, believing that such a huge wave was a result of speculative manipulation and unwilling to suffer this unnecessary sacrifice by repeatedly paying, unanimously allied to stop payment. Currently, the exchange authorities are negotiating with the large bull operators, such as so-and-so, offering them certain benefits and requesting them to stop the manipulation. Before the negotiations have a result, there will likely be a de facto halt.

### Zhu Qinglan Reports on the Disaster Situation in Sichuan and Gansu After On-Site Investigation

As the disaster situation in Sichuan and Gansu provinces was serious, Qinglan believed that it was urgently necessary to conduct an on-site investigation. On April 17th, he took Secretary Rao Fenghuang and departed from Nanjing for Shanghai. On the 19th, he flew west from Shanghai, taking Chongqing as the gateway to eastern Sichuan, arriving there on the same day. On the 20th, he went to nearby villages to inspect the disaster situation. It happened to be after the major fire in Chongqing and Jiang'an, and because the location was a hub, refugees from neighboring counties flocked there, and there were daily deaths. Therefore, he summoned local officials and gentry and immediately established ten urban and rural porridge kitchens, appropriating 30,000 yuan for expenses, and telegraphed the Beijing headquarters of this association to first allocate 1,000 yuan, and requested the Shanghai Charity Relief Association and the Ta Kung Pao newspaper to raise funds. At the same time, a major fire in Wanxian burned for three days, destroying over 4,000 households. He discussed relief with the officials and gentry of that county by telegram, deciding to provide each of the 5,000 extremely poor and dependent people with a relief fund of 6 yuan, totaling 30,000 yuan. In addition to allocating a relief fund of 10,000 yuan, the remaining 20,000 yuan was raised locally and handed over to Cheng Maoxing, the administrative commissioner stationed in Wanxian, and He Beiheng, the police chief of Chongqing, to be responsible for handling the matter. On the 21st, he flew to Chengdu and contacted and consulted with the provincial government, the provincial relief commission, and people from various counties. It was estimated that over 130 counties were affected by the disaster. Based on the actual investigations obtained from various parties, according to the disaster investigation standard table, it was decided that Zhongxian, Yuechi, and other counties were the most severely affected, and Xuanhan, Langzhong, and other counties were severely affected, with a total of 72 counties, and the rest were slightly affected. It was agreed to distribute the cash converted from the central government's relief bonds of 1 million yuan, totaling 714,000 yuan, as well as the 1 million yuan raised by the province, and the 280,000 yuan requested from the central government, totaling 2 million yuan, to be distributed according to the disaster situation, with some remaining to supplement the remaining counties. Qinglan's relief efforts in various places were all handled by charitable organizations with experience in investigation and distribution. This time, due to the long and obstructed roads, the expenses were very high, so he requested the provincial government's relief commission to select one investigation and distribution head from each county, totaling over 130 officials. They were personally instructed according to the established investigation and distribution regulations. After each investigation and distribution head arrived in the county, they again selected and dispatched dozens of investigators and distributors from the local area, instructed them, and examined and distributed the relief tickets to each household in groups, according to the procedures stipulated in the regulations. At the same time, the investigation and distribution head, together with the local government, posted notices, scheduling the distribution of funds by area based on tickets. The amount of funds distributed was based on 1 yuan per person as a unit. The work of checking households and issuing tickets took about three weeks for small counties and about a month for large counties. Because the relief funds were limited and the disaster was widespread and the population large, it was necessary to detail the methods and strictly screen to ensure that the disaster victims who could not survive without relief would actually receive relief. The investigation and distribution personnel in each county were sent out at the beginning of May to conduct household inspections and ticket distribution work. The fastest ones could be completed in late May. The Beijing Relief Association had remitted the relief funds in mid-May for storage for distribution needs. The emergency relief procedures could be completed in June. When in Beijing, he had jointly presented to the Executive Yuan with the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance to dispatch Hong San, a special commissioner for supervising the distribution of relief funds in Sichuan, who had assisted Qinglan in handling relief for many years and had completed the relief work in Xikang. He arrived in Sichuan in early May to implement supervision and distribution. The Ministry of Finance sent Inspector Cao to various places to inspect the disaster situation. After the inspection, he would discuss with the supervising commissioner and the provincial government's relief commission to appropriately increase the amount of relief in places where the allocated funds were slightly less, so as to make up for the deficiencies. As for the elderly, weak, and hungry people who were wandering and dependent in various places, in addition to Chongqing having other methods, the investigation and distribution heads in each county were instructed to first set up shelters when they arrived in the county to accommodate homeless male and female disaster children. Each person's monthly porridge ration was set at 1.5 yuan. In addition to providing food and clothing, they were taught to read and write and the knowledge that citizens should have, temporarily for a period of one year. The required expenses were raised by telegraphed to the authorities and philanthropists in Tianjin, Shanghai, Shandong, Qingdao, Hunan, and Guangdong. Funds had been successively remitted, and new and old clothing and pants and other items had been raised from the sea, land, army, police agencies, and charitable people in various places, requesting the Ministry of Railways to transport them to Xi'an on behalf of the victims, and requesting the General Headquarters to borrow cars for transportation. When Gansu Province was distributed to various disaster areas, He, the newly appointed chairman of Gansu Province, had taken office, so he compiled and sent the petitions of various places for reading and instructed them to quickly provide relief. Chen, the finance director of the Provincial Government, replied, agreeing to immediately find a way to postpone the tobacco tax or find other ways to offset it. If it could be implemented early, it could be of some help. The Gansu Provincial Farmers Bank had received an order from Chairman Chiang to allocate 500,000 yuan to handle farmer loans, but it had not yet been able to reach the Hexi counties. It was hoped that the power of politics could be used to promote universal loans to boost agriculture. It was heard that Ma Buqing, the commander of the 5th Cavalry Division stationed in Liangzhou, had distributed 10,000 stones of relief grain and 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in relief funds, and lent seeds to farmers, which the counties relied on for spring planting. Unfortunately, only 20% to 30% of the farmers had already planted, and still awaited the Farmers Bank's loans to be popularized as soon as possible. The small people in the most difficult areas of Hexi would have a chance to regenerate, and the disaster would not spread. This was a general plan for Gansu relief. (To be continued)

### Declaration from the Film and Drama Circles Protesting the Public Screening of "The New Land"

The Joint Meeting of the First Special Municipality Submits a Request for Negotiation to Stop It

Bu Wancang and over three hundred others from the Shanghai film and drama circles jointly signed a declaration yesterday protesting the public screening in China of the Japanese-German co-produced film "The New Land," stating that, "What is the significance of the Japanese-German co-produced 'The New Land' being publicly screened on Chinese land under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Settlement? The newspapers have already provided detailed critiques, but we feel it is necessary to further arouse serious attention from all sectors and express our opinions here. Friends, 'The New Land' is definitely not a promotional film. The significance it represents is the active aggression of fascist countries united against us. The Four Northeastern Provinces are our land, Chinese land that Japanese imperialism forcibly seized from our territory with bayonets. However, in this film, it has become the enemy's 'New Land,' a paradise for the ambitions of the invaders. In 'The New Land,' the invaders flaunt the resources of the Four Northeastern Provinces to their people and encourage them to migrate there, so that the Four Northeastern Provinces will forever become their colony, developing the rich resources there to supply them for further annexation. Japanese imperialists will interfere in our domestic national defense films and dramas, and many domestic films and dramas have suffered censorship due to Japanese protests, and even cannot be publicly performed. Not to mention the films transported to North China and the Four Northeastern Provinces. However, 'The New Land,' which promotes Japanese aggression, is openly transported to China for screening, and the several places that the Settlement Film Censor Office proposed to cut have not been cut at all. The Municipal Council has always been nitpicking in its censorship of domestic films and dramas, especially those with national defense significance, and is often unreasonably censored and subjected to various difficulties. So far, a script of 'A Corner of the City' has not been allowed to be staged because of the phrase 'The Northeast is ours.' But this time, the Municipal Council refuses to cut the film for 'The New Land' and pretends to be deaf and dumb without pursuing the matter. This is obviously their consistent policy of oppression against China and concession to the invaders. We should loudly protest the production of films like 'The New Land,' let alone that they are now transported to China for public screening. Can we keep our mouths shut and say nothing? If we still have a bit of blood and conscience, if we are unwilling to be slapped on the right cheek and then offer the left cheek to be slapped again, then we can only unite and shout out our protest, roar, friends, and let our compatriots recognize the dangerous significance represented by 'The New Land,' break the invaders' dream of anesthetizing the Chinese people, and let the whole world know the invaders' ruthless means and the Chinese people's indignation. Friends, roar at 'The New Land' and fight against aggression. If we continue to swallow our anger, then one day the entire China will become the invaders' 'New Land.' Roar, friends! ㊀ We demand that the government immediately stop the public screening of 'The New Land.' ㊁ We demand that the government lodge a serious protest with Japan and Germany, eliminate the negatives of 'The New Land,' guarantee that the same humiliating films will never be produced again, and apologize to the Chinese government and people. ㊂ We demand that the government revoke the Settlement's film and drama censorship rights and all cultural censorship agencies set up against China. ㊃ We demand that the government actively promote national defense films and national defense dramas to resist imperialist films that promote aggression. ㊄ We demand that the government use force to recover the enemy's so-called 'New Land,' our lost land."

The Joint Council of Citizens of the First Special District held its second executive committee meeting at its headquarters yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. More than twenty people, including Lin Kanghou, Zhang Yichen, Wan Futian, and Liu Zhongfu, attended. After Chairman Zhang Yichen reported on the association's affairs, the following cases were discussed: ㊀ The case of the Japanese Towa Cinema screening the humiliating film "The New Land" should be negotiated and stopped immediately. It was resolved that the case should be submitted to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiation and cessation. (Remainder omitted)

### American Express Employee Embezzles 5,000 US Dollars, Travels to Famous Scenic Spots Throughout the Country

Squandering Money Like Dirt in Brothels and Singing Halls Everywhere - Even Donated 3,000 Dollars to Frontline Soldiers

Liu Songlu, also known as Liu Paulo and Lao Kunnian, a Cantonese man aged 25, residing at No. 104 Chunyang Lane, Zhongyouheng Road, graduated from St. Francis College. He had been working as a clerk at the American Express Travel Service at No. 49 Nanjing Road since the year before last. He usually performed well at work, so he was deeply trusted by the manager, a Westerner named Kaideng. On November 6th of last year, Kaideng placed 5,000 US dollars (equivalent to 16,750 Chinese yuan) in an envelope and ordered Liu to seal it with sealing wax and mail it to Citibank in New York, USA. Unexpectedly, Liu had malicious intentions and embezzled the letter. He fabricated an identical letter and put blank paper into it, pretending it was US dollar bills, and mailed it. On the 16th of the same month, he resigned on the pretext of illness and used the money to travel leisurely throughout the country to famous scenic spots in Pingjin, Hankou, and Hangzhou. Because the money was not earned through hard work, he squandered it recklessly, spending money like dirt in brothels and singing halls everywhere. At that time, the Suiyuan War was raging, and Liu immediately donated 3,000 yuan to frontline soldiers. Every night, he indulged in singing and dancing to the fullest extent. On December 2nd, American Express received a telegram from Citibank in New York, and only then did they discover Liu's embezzlement. They immediately reported it to the General Police Station and ordered detectives to investigate. Because Liu's whereabouts were unknown, they requested the First Special Court to issue an arrest warrant for his arrest. Until recently, Hua Detective Sun Jishan and Han Shoushan learned that Liu was hiding in Hangzhou, so they rushed to meet the Hangzhou police detectives and arrested Liu in Qinghefang, Hangzhou, on the 6th of this month, and brought him back to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the case and prosecuted him for occupational embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Code. He said that, regarding the embezzled money, it was claimed that it had been spent, but the way he used it was unbelievable. Only 2,000 yuan was given to his mother, Liu Huo, and now detectives have recovered 570 yuan in cash, a pocket watch, a watch chain, and four rings. As for the rest of the money, he said that it had been used to repay debts, buy medicine for family use, and hire a lawyer. The defendant had also confessed to the police that he had committed the crime without denying it. This case should be postponed for further investigation into the use of the defendant's funds. Then, Kaideng, the manager of American Express, submitted a complaint about the circumstances. When questioned, Liu Songkun admitted that he had replaced and embezzled the 5,000 US dollars. As for the money, apart from 2,000 yuan given to his father and mother, the rest was spent on traveling and dancing in various places. There was no money left, and he was even pawning things to make a living. When I was arrested, the detectives found eight pawn tickets on my person, which was clear evidence. Qian Hongye, the head of the criminal court, verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for further interrogation at a later date.

### Shanghai Police Bureau Forbids Catching Field Frogs

The Jiangwan Supervision Office of the Shanghai Police Bureau has jurisdiction over many farmland areas. Now that it is between spring and summer, the sound of frogs is heard everywhere, and it is a breeding area for field frogs. Field frogs are beneficial insects that benefit agricultural crops, and the authorities have always protected them. However, ordinary people often greedily take them for food, and ignorant villagers also rush to catch them and sell them in the market. Yesterday, a villager named Mao Xiaozi in the area caught two large baskets of field frogs in one day, and was about to carry them out of the Jiangwan Station to Shanghai to sell them at a good price. Suddenly, he was discovered by a patrol officer, who detained him and took him to the station. The police chief of the battalion, An Taidong, gave him a face-to-face lecture and released him. At the same time, the police took the two large baskets of field frogs to a watery farmland and released them to benefit agricultural crops.

### Zhang Rongchang and His Wife Reconcile as Before

Divorce Case Settled in Court

Zhang Rongchang, a teacher (24 years old), married Jiang Yaoying (25 years old, from Kanggou, Pudong) five years ago. For the first two years, their love was quite sweet. For the past three years, the couple has been estranged. It has been three years since the wife has lived with her husband. Zhang Rongchang then sued his wife for divorce in the local court. His reason was that his wife had abandoned her husband, had not lived with him for three years, and he could not bear the loneliness of a widower and the lack of wifely love. Yesterday, after trial by Judge Tu Huazhou, Zhang Rongchang said his wife had gone to Ningbo two years prior and had not returned, and he was unable to meet her when he went to seek her. Thus, he requested a divorce, to avoid being suspended in name only. Jiang Yaoying, upon receiving the summons, arrived in court on time and confessed, "Because my parents forced me to marry, and the dowry was meager, I was despised and driven back to Ningbo. My grandmother and mother accompanied me back. For the first two years, we were still kind to each other. Later, my husband had an affair, so I was abused. When my father died at the age of 23, I lived in my uncle's house. In October, my uncle sent me back and I was beaten again. Helplessly, I still live in my uncle's house." Each side stated their case. However, when Zhang saw his beautiful wife, his heart blossomed. He said that he did not want a divorce. The judge said, "This is very good. Withdraw the lawsuit." Zhang then said, "But she has been out for several years, and I don't know where she lives. My reputation is very important." He meant to ask the court to guarantee it for him. The judge said, "This is a lifelong matter for the couple. How can the court guarantee it for you? If the couple is harmonious, they will naturally be happy." He instructed that Jiang Yaoying should be mindful of the meaning of following her husband and should be a suitable wife and mother. Both should go home and understand each other well. They then replied, "We obey," and a reconciliation was reached. They left hand in hand, reliving old dreams.

### Fan Wenyuan Abandons His Wife to Seduce Her Two Younger Sisters

The Defendant Claims He Discovered His Wife Was Not a Virgin When They Married Fifteen Years Ago

Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Meng Tingke of the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court heard a scandalous case of one arrow striking two targets. The plaintiff in this case is a Ningbo woman, Fan Ying, also known as Ying Xiu'e. The defendants are her husband, Fan Wenyuan, and her younger sisters, Ying Xiao'e and Ying Xiang'e. The details of the case are recorded below. Fan Wenyuan, a Ningbo native, is 32 years old and works in real estate. Fifteen years ago, through a matchmaker, he married Ying Xiu'e (now 33 years old), also from Ningbo. They resided at No. 30, Lane 640, Liaoyang Road, Hongkou. The couple's relationship was initially harmonious, and they had four children. For over a decade, they lived peacefully. However, Ying Xiu'e has four sisters. She is the second oldest. The eldest sister is already married. The third, Ying Xiao'e, is 28 years old, and the youngest, Ying Xiang'e, is 24 years old, and are both unmarried. Due to their familial ties, they frequently visited each other. Around November of last year, the relationship between Fan Wenyuan and his wife suddenly changed. Ying Xiu'e, claiming she could no longer endure her husband's abuse, quickly returned to her mother's home at No. 17, Lane 606, Gordon Road. Unexpectedly, on December 18th, Fan Wenyuan suddenly left home, and Ying Xiao'e and Ying Xiang'e also ran away from home. Ying Xiu'e immediately became suspicious, believing that her husband's and her sisters' departures were related. She began a secret investigation and recently discovered that her husband was indeed having an affair with both of her sisters. They were living together at No. 73, Shanghai Lane, Avenue Edward VII. She hired Lawyer Fan Gang to report the matter to the Huishi Police Station around 4:00 AM yesterday. Detectives Li Wenbin (Chinese) and Gibson (Western) were dispatched and found Fan Wenyuan, Ying Xiao'e, and Ying Xiang'e sleeping in the same room. They were immediately arrested, taken to the police station, and detained separately. They were then transferred to the First Special District Court. Police Station Lawyer Jiang Baolian charged them with the crime of disrupting marriage according to Article 2319 of the Criminal Code and presented the above situation. When questioned, Fan Wenyuan admitted to having a relationship with Ying Xiao'e and Ying Xiang'e simultaneously since March of last year. They first rented a house at No. 24, Nanlin Lane, Xinjiang Road, and lived together. On April 15th of this year, they moved to No. 73, Shanghai Lane, Avenue Edward VII. However, the cause of this case is quite complicated. "Because when I married the plaintiff, Ying Xiu'e, fifteen years ago, I discovered that she was not a virgin. I have tolerated this for over a decade. But the plaintiff's behavior has been improper, and she has previously eloped. I went to my in-laws' house to inquire about her whereabouts, and that's how I developed relationships with her two sisters. The details of what happened are too much to explain," he said. Ying Xiao'e and Ying Xiang'e also confessed to having an affair with their sister's husband. According to the plaintiff, Fan Ying, a Ningbo native, 33 years old, currently residing at No. 11, Lane 60, Gordon Road, "Fan Wenyuan is my husband. Xiao'e and Xiang'e are my younger sisters. In November of last year, I was abused by my husband and kicked, so I returned to my mother's home. Unexpectedly, in December, my two sisters and my husband disappeared at the same time. One day, I ran into them at the Empress Theater, and I realized they were having an affair. Now my husband is falsely accusing me of not being a virgin, which is completely inhumane," she said. The court ordered the three defendants to be detained and rescheduled the hearing for next Wednesday morning.

### Marrying a Concubine While Already Having a Wife

One Remaining Candle, Two Marriage Certificates: A'gen and His Concubine Sentenced

Wen A'gen, a 28-year-old Ningbo native who runs a knitting shop at No. 3, Avenue Road, married Ms. Dai (currently 24 years old), also from Ningbo, in the winter of 1930. They have one son and two daughters. Wen A'gen had an affair with Chen Xiuying (27 years old), a Ningbo woman living at No. 165, Dengtuo Road. Chen is six months pregnant. Knowing that he already had a wife, she refused to be a concubine. After discussions, Wen A'gen, with the help of his friend A'san and others as matchmakers, concealed the truth from his wife, Ms. Dai. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, at the Da Zhonghua Restaurant at No. 465, Dalian Bay Road, he invited friends and held a banquet with three tables, openly marrying Chen Xiuying. Afterward, they stayed overnight in Room 304 of the Da Hu Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. After settling everything, they moved from Dengtuo Road to No. 32, Lane 628, East Xihua Road, and began living together. However, after the marriage, his wife, Ms. Dai, discovered everything and rushed to the restaurant to confront them. It was already evening, and her husband and Xiuying had returned to the hotel. She took the remaining red candle used during their wedding ceremony as evidence. The day before yesterday, Wen A'gen returned to the shop, and Ms. Dai argued with him. He became angry and beat her violently. She took the opportunity to report the incident to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Detective Dong Qingquan was dispatched to No. 13, Avenue Road, and No. 32, East Xihua Road, to arrest Wen A'gen and Chen Xiuying. Two marriage certificates were found in Room 304 of the Da Hu Hotel. They were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Station Lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, prosecuting them for the crime of disrupting marriage according to Article 237 of the Criminal Code. Detective Dong Hua then explained the process of arresting the two defendants and presented the marriage certificates and the red candle. Ms. Dai claimed to have been married to A'gen for seven years and presented her marriage certificate, along with evidence of their one son and two daughters. Wen A'gen confessed to having known Ms. Chen for many years. Recently, she became pregnant, and he had no other choice. He denied having performed the wedding ceremony. Ms. Chen (i.e., Xiuying) confessed, "I am a Miss. I have known A'gen for many years. Now I am pregnant, so I had to marry him." Judge Xiao Xiecai sentenced Wen A'gen and Chen Xiuying to four months of imprisonment each, with a two-year suspended sentence. The remaining wedding candle was confiscated.

### Providing a Handgun for Robbery, Foreman Arrested

Wang Songshan Handed Over to the City Police Bureau

On January 29th of this year, a robbery occurred at the Peng residence at No. 25, Lane 79, Xiaojiu Hua Road, Nanshi. The robbers broke in, brandished a gun to silence the residents, and stole valuables worth over 1,000 yuan. Recently, detectives from the City Police Bureau arrested a local suspect named Zhang Linfu. He confessed that the handgun used in the robbery was provided by Wang Songshan, a Nanjing native residing at No. 24, Xinkang Lane, Lane 190, Yangzhou Road, in the Public Concession. Detective Wang Peiting, along with the suspect Zhang, went to the Yulin Road Police Station at 1:30 AM yesterday to request assistance in the arrest. Chinese and Western detectives secretly went to the address and arrested Wang and took him to the police station for detention. At 9:00 AM, he was transferred to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Station Lawyer Zhang Tianyin recounted the events and expressed agreement with the City Police Bureau's request for transfer, but noted that a formal letter from the bureau was required. Detective Wang Peiting, representing the City Police Bureau, explained that due to the urgency of the situation, he did not have an official document. He stated that the arrested robber, Zhang Linfu, claimed that Wang Songshan was his mentor (i.e., "Old Head") and had provided the handgun used in the Xiaojiu Hua Road robbery. When questioned, Wang Songshan, a foreman at the Ewo Mill in Yangshupu, claimed that he did not know Zhang Linfu and had not provided any handgun. Judge Xiao Xiecai ordered that Wang Songshan be transferred to the City Police Bureau for further investigation this afternoon.

### Gong the Monk's Wife Dies from Severe Injuries

Gong the Monk from Pudong, angered by his wife Yao Jinmei's insistence on divorce, waited for her near the intersection of Yanchang Road and Fenshan Road around 6:00 PM on the 7th, as she left work at the Jichang Factory. He knocked her down and slashed her repeatedly with a kitchen knife. Yao suffered eleven knife wounds and lost consciousness. She was taken to the Pudong Hospital by the police and then transferred to the Renji Hospital for treatment. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Yao died from her injuries yesterday evening. Her family has claimed the body for an autopsy.

### World Shipping Rates Continue to Rise

Recently, the global demand for shipping has been high, but tonnage is limited, and supply and demand are unbalanced, causing congestion. A year ago, the shipping rate for grain from the Plata River in Argentina to Europe was about 18 shillings per ton. Now, it has reached 35 shillings per ton. Shipping corn from the Plata River to the US Pacific coast and the St. Lawrence ports is 40 shillings per ton. A year ago, shipping sugar from Santo Domingo and Cuba to Europe cost between 12 shillings 6 pence and 13 shillings 6 pence per ton. Currently, it is about 27 shillings. A year ago, shipping scrap iron from the US to the UK cost 12 shillings 9 pence, and to Japan, it cost 14 shillings. Recently, shipping to Europe costs 26 shillings 6 pence, and to Japan, it reached 38 shillings, and the trend is expected to continue. Other industries are also setting record high prices, with strong momentum. Current prices are likely to rise further soon.

### Dongting Dongshan Native Place Association Holds General Meeting

### French Police Uncover Pornographic Photography Ring

The morals section of the French police recently received a tip that a studio for taking pornographic photos with Chinese, Western, male, female, old and young actors was located on the third floor of No. 301, Avenue Edward VII. Inspector Li Pai, along with detectives Qin Youyu and Tian Shiqing, led a team of Chinese and Western police officers to the location. They arrested Zhang Laosi (15 years old, from Nanjing) and Zhang Jinshi (41 years old, a woman from Changshu) and confiscated a large number of pornographic photos and a camera. They confessed that No. 29, Yuqing Lane, Baliqiao Road, and No. 17, Lixian Lane, were branch locations. The detectives continued to these two locations and arrested Gu Bishi (25 years old, from Suzhou) and Jin Zhaoji (25 years old, from Nanjing), and confiscated photos, undeveloped negatives, chemicals, and film. The main culprits, Gu Sifu and Ren Xihe, had already fled. The arrested suspects were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, the defendants, along with 52 dozen pornographic photos, 5 dozen Dongxiang photos, 8 dozen Western photos, 2 dozen photos of various Chinese and Western subjects, male, female, old, and young, 4 cameras, and various film and chemicals, were transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi explained the case and prosecuted them for manufacturing and possessing obscene photos and disrupting public morals. Judge Qiu Huanying questioned the defendants separately and ordered them to be detained and rescheduled the hearing for the 12th.

### Prosecutor Appeals Case Against Three Detectives

Searching People's Homes Without Reason: Freedom of Residence Will Lose Protection

Liu Bingyuan, the leader of the Sixth Squad of the Zhabei Detachment of the City Police Bureau's Detective Brigade, along with detectives Miao Yizhong, Wu Songshan, etc., were previously sued by merchants and residents of the area, including Ruan Defu, at the Shanghai Local Court for crimes such as infringing on freedom. Prosecutor Li Fen believed that a public prosecution should be initiated. After four public hearings by Judges Li Xuedeng and Yu Lude in the Third Criminal Court, the three detectives were found not guilty on the 8th of last month. The appeal period has passed since the judgment was sent. Now, Deputy Prosecutor Yang believes that the judgment needs to be appealed. In addition to already declaring an appeal, he also states the reasons for disagreement as follows: "Upon review of the investigation file No. 8261 of this court for the 25th year, Gu Naide and Niu Shiqi did not state that there were handguns or axes hidden in the homes of Ruan Defu and Shi Dengnian on page 6. During the investigation, Gu Naide was questioned and stated that he never said to the detective team that Ruan Defu and Shi Dengnian had handguns in their homes. The original judgment stated that Liu Bingyuan, Miao Yizhong, and Wu Songshan went to Ruan Defu's store and Shi Dengnian's home to search for handguns based on the statements of Gu Naide (i.e., Gu Xiaowuzi) and Niu Shiqi. It is unknown on what basis this was stated. It can be seen that the defendants did not search the homes of Ruan Defu, etc., based on the statements of Gu Naide and Niu Shiqi. Moreover, the defendants did not receive any tip-offs besides these statements. Without even human testimony, they somehow decided that Ruan Defu and Shi Dengnian hid guns in their homes, and then suddenly went to search. In the end they could not find any weapons. If this is permissible, then it means that the defendants can search people's homes at any time, arbitrarily and without reason. Then the freedom of the people will be left unprotected. The original judgment saying that the conduct of the defendants searching the home of Ruan Defu and Shi Dengnian was not a crime is truly inappropriate and should be appealed in order to remedy the matter."

### Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Association to Hold Board Meeting Tomorrow

Although the droughts in various provinces have been relieved by repeated appropriations of funds, in Henan Province, in addition to emergency work relief, reception centers have been established in Zhengzhou and Luoyang to accommodate refugees. Funds have also been allocated to the Gansu branch to actively provide relief. Relief efforts are also underway in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. However, at this time of year when the old harvest is gone and the new one is not in, famine victims are waiting even more eagerly. It has been decided to convene a meeting of all Chinese and Western directors tomorrow to discuss continuing to allocate funds. If any philanthropists are willing to help, donations can be sent to the association as soon as possible to relieve the disaster areas and the hardships of the people of Jiangsu.

### Negotiations Over Collision Between Taikoo's Shandong Wheel and Fishing Boat

The Incident Occurred Last Winter in the Waters off Putuo: Fishing Boat Sank, Seven Drowned

The Taikoo company's Shandong Wheel collided with Jin Zaiyu's fishing boat on November 8th of last year in the waters off Putuo, Zhejiang. The fishing boat immediately sank, and seven crew members, including Shao Afang, Lin Caiquan, Wang Jianjin, Wang Shunshuang, Guo Biliang, Zheng Deqing, and Chen Alian, drowned. Although the parties involved came to Shanghai afterward to negotiate with the company and file a complaint with the British Consulate, no results were achieved due to insufficient documentation. It is now known that the families of the deceased have collected documents and come to Shanghai to request assistance from the Ningbo Native Place Association and other organizations to continue to negotiate with the shipping company and the consulate for compensation.

### Boatman Disappears After Crossing to Another Boat: Adulterer Interrogated

Mother Accuses Zhu of Being Her Daughter-in-Law's Lover: Official, Considering the Seriousness of the Case, Summons Witnesses for Strict Interrogation

Ma Sifa, a 20-year-old man from Shandong, lived with his mother and two younger brothers and made a living by rowing a boat. They lived on a large boat in the Yangjing Port of Pudong. When Ma was 17 years old, his mother arranged for him to marry Wang as a child bride. Wang was younger than Ma. Two years later, when Ma was 19, they had a simple wedding at home. The young couple lived together on another sampan, living in each others pocket and with much affection for each other. After eleven years, Wang gave birth to a six-year-old son, named Fugeng, who lived with his grandmother on her boat. At midnight on April 14th of this year, Ma was already asleep in the middle cabin (as was his habit, he slept naked), while Wang was alone, planning to go to the Dinghaiqiao Yushan Port to pick up passengers. Ma suddenly disappeared on the way. On the 16th, Ma Wang suddenly reported to the Customs Water Police Station that their boat had been hit by a Chongming fishing boat in Pudong, causing the boat to list and take on water. Her husband then crossed to the fishing boat to argue, but was taken away and his whereabouts are unknown. She requested an investigation, etc. At 9:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd of last month, a naked male corpse was discovered on the beach of Chenjiazuipo in Pudong after the tide receded. The Water Police Station summoned Wang, who confirmed that the corpse was indeed her husband. However, the body had been scavenged by wild dogs, and the face, hands, and feet were damaged. The police chief ordered detective Yao Guofa to report the autopsy to the court and ordered Wang to claim the body. Recently, Ma's mother, Ms. Lü, filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing her daughter-in-law of colluding with an outsider to throw her son into the Pudong River at night to murder him. Her reasons for the accusation were that the sampan was allegedly hit by a fishing boat, but the hull was not damaged at all. Ma was sleeping naked on the boat, and when he woke up, he jumped onto the fishing boat and was taken away. Why were the quilt, mat, and three pieces of clothing all missing? If the boat had listed severely, causing the items to fall into the river, why were the pots, stove, bowls, and chopsticks intact? Furthermore, the middle cabin had taken on water, but the front and rear cabins were dry. She also accused Zhu Yunzhang (30 years old), a fellow boatman from the same village, of being her daughter-in-law's lover. The court, after receiving the complaint, arrested and detained Ma Wang for questioning. After the incident, it was well-known among the boatmen in the area. At the beginning of this month, hundreds of residents gathered on the No. 7 bridge on Pudong Avenue, eager to see Ma Wang executed on the spot for murdering her husband. The Yangjingkou police station sent a patrol officer to the scene to explain that the execution was just a rumor. The crowd dispersed after a long time. As for the main character in the case, Ma Wang, after several investigations by the prosecutor, the court recently sent bailiffs to arrest the adulterer Zhu Yunzhang. Due to the seriousness of the case, they were interrogated separately under strict conditions.

### French Concession Trials Small Automobiles

Fees Calculated According to Meter: Minimum Charge of One Dime

According to the Continental Daily, last year, a Frenchman named Rivie proposed to establish a small car company, charging extremely low fares for residents in the concession. He submitted a request to the Municipal Council for approval, but it was rejected. It is now known that the French Concession Municipal Council has approved the plan and issued vehicle licenses. The cars are expected to be on the road within about ten days. However, as the Public Concession has not approved the plan, the cars cannot currently enter the Public Concession. The cars will charge fees according to a meter, with a minimum fare of only one dime. Six Austin cars have already been delivered and will be tested first. If they are well-received, the plan is to gradually increase the number of cars.

### Jinshan Native Place Association Schedules Inaugural Meeting

Chen Taoyi, etc., Elected as Presidium

The Jinshan Native Place Association in Shanghai has been in preparation for nearly a year. It is now known that the association has decided at its fourth preparatory meeting to hold its inaugural meeting at the Minzhi Middle School on Weihaiwei Road at 1:00 PM on the 13th of this month (Sunday). Chen Taoyi, Gao Junxiang, Shen Siqi, Chen Duanzhi, and Wen Bing were elected as the presidium. Yang Daohong and Ye Xin'an will serve as recorders, and Chu Shichao as master of ceremonies. Gao Junbin, Wu Jialin, He Gongdu, Hu Youshan, and Yao Kunliang will be in charge. Gu Zhigang, Bao Huishu, Lu Shizhong, Jiang Guobin, Huang Jinghan, and Xu Xingxiu will be in charge of reception. In addition to submitting a request to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau to send personnel to provide guidance, all solicitation committee members have been notified to inform all members. Due to the limited time, it is not possible to notify everyone. Fellow townsmen from the county residing in Shanghai are welcome to participate. People from the county have always had a good reputation, and there are over five or six hundred people residing in Shanghai and working in various institutions and schools. To enrich the association's activities, all elders in the hometown, fellow townsmen living abroad, and people from all walks of life who support the association's objectives are welcome to join as members. The association's statement is recorded below:

"Our Jinshan is a small county, established only 100 years ago, with an area of only 40 li and a population of only 170,000. It is only a hundred or so li away from Shanghai. The number of people from Jinshan residing here, including the old and young, is only a few hundred. Yet, we are establishing a native place association. Why is this the case? The answer is: governing the country begins with governing the hometown, and self-improvement values unity. The people of our country are accustomed to selfish views and skilled in self-seeking. They lack training in collective and communal living and are ignorant of the ways of modern nation-building. Therefore, individually, they are still one of the world's outstanding ethnic groups, but collectively, they everywhere expose the shortcomings of their dispersiveness and lack of discipline. This is what our people should painfully reflect on and correct. What is the way of modern nation-building? It is to replace individualism with collectivism. The strength of collectivism lies in organization. The more tightly organized, the greater the strength of collectivism and the greater the welfare of individuals. The organization of native place associations in various places is intended to focus the mind and unite the will, and using the power of the collective to work for the general welfare. People who leave their hometowns are more likely to show sincerity and love for each other. Although the land of Jinshan is narrow and the number of people from Jinshan residing in Shanghai is small, it wants to unite and contribute its thoughts and talents to the nation and the country, and to work for the welfare of the public, then its aspirations will not fall behind others. Therefore, the organization of the Jinshan Native Place Association not only strengthens the bonds of friendship, but also aims to help the reform of the hometown's administration, taking the handling of the affairs of the native place association as a starting point and serving the nation and the country as the ultimate goal, using the native place association as a sharp tool and serving the people as an indicator, not abandoning the weeds, cherishing one's own broom, and I, the fathers, brothers, sisters, and aunts of my hometown, also feel that this is not wrong. Let me speak on the matter of the affairs of the Native Place Association and the responsibilities of our people. Jinshan is located in the southeast, a barrier for Beijing and Shanghai. Mengguwasi used to control seagoing ships, and the Ming Dynasty established a guard to defend against pirates. Whenever there were warnings of coastal defense, Jinshan was a battleground for the military. If they want to strengthen the borders, colonization is the way to do it, this is its one. The coastal lands are mostly saline and there is little water for storage. The households rarely hide their wealth, and the people's emotions are fierce and bandits are rampant. The sources of chaos are latent, and will erupt whenever there's a single touch. If we want to prevent any future danger, we must be clear about what comes first, this is its two. Our hometown used to be a lake country, where the Zhe Lake was at its peak. From the sea outlet, the Zhe River blocked the eastern river's tide from reversing. But now the river's strength cannot match the cloudiness, and the port becomes blocked and narrow. We wish to avoid droughts and floods, and must promote water control, this is its three. Over the years, the damage of locusts and caterpillars has been harmful, and famine has repeatedly occurred. The villages have declined and industry and commerce have withered. People have no food in their containers, and their homes are bare. They are tired from working all year, and are unable to receive a full meal. If we want to enrich people and their wealth, we must promote industry, this is its four. In the early years of the Qing dynasty, culture and artifacts were flourishing, talent flourished, high officials flocked to observe, for 300 years, the morale of scholars withered away, and the world's morals were lost, and the clean fragrance no longer occurred. A big saying is hard to continue, if we want to promote the culture, we must rely on education, this is its five. Other things such as supporting the county's government, reforming the ethnicity, providing guidance through discussions, constructing and planning projects will directly allow the hometown to become prosperous every day. It can also provide intangible convenience for outsiders. We workers serving in Shanghai, although lacking in talent, are able to display the way we live month after month, day after day. Looking back at our hometown, who does not have the ancestral residence of our ancestors, who does not think about their children and grandchildren flourishing, who does not want to make their hometown beautiful and good? In addition, with the establishment of this association, fellow people in Shanghai can share news with each other, help each other in their careers, have the opportunity to meet and discuss, have a time for entertainment, get guidance to study, get introductions to jobs, resolve disputes, celebrate marriages, console each other during funerals, rescue and support those in need, and encourage each other, and show through action that their strength extends from the hometown to a country and a nation, saving those in danger and rescuing those in need. Is it the chance to fix any problems? Anything is easy to start, and anything that is about to be held is huge, and I hope that all gentleman will come!"

### ### Robbery of a Cigarette and Cash Shop in the Mainland Market, Nankou

About Two Hundred Yuan Stolen

At about 10:40 last night, four bandits suddenly went to the cigarette and cash shop at No. 4, Lane 350, Jiujiang Road, which is the exit of the Mainland Market on Er Ma Road, to commit robbery. Two of the bandits were armed with guns. They first pretended to buy cigarettes and then used their guns to force the shop owner to open the door. They then monitored the actions of the men and women inside, forbidding them from making any noise. The two unarmed bandits searched the cash register and stole all the banknotes, silver dollars, and small change, totaling about one hundred yuan. They then fled without a trace. The shop owner immediately reported the incident to the Central Police Station, requesting them to pursue and apprehend the bandits.

### The Huangpu River Will Experience High Tides During the Dragon Boat Festival

A Total of Six Days Starting Yesterday - The Weather in This City Has Turned Sunny and Cool

The weather in this city suddenly became hot on the 7th, but after torrential thunderstorms in the afternoon, it finally cooled down. However, the air pressure immediately began to drop, and the sky was overcast, making it extremely unstable. By yesterday morning, the sky had cleared, and the sun shone through the clouds, but the weather was quite cold and cool, requiring the wearing of lined clothing, unlike summer weather. As a result, the cold drink stalls were deserted.

### Wife of Murder Victim Testifies Against Suspects in a Murder for Money

Witnesses Awaiting Summons for Further Questioning

In Sunjia Lane, Jiangwan District, a local man named Yang Daosheng (also known as Yang Daosheng, 40 years old) and Zhang Fucheng (42 years old) jointly opened a small teahouse and, after the Lunar New Year this year, opened a gambling den. A villager named Yang Qiusheng, who was a laborer, received thirty yuan in wages on the evening of March 29th and went to gamble. He lost five yuan. When he went outside, it was already midnight, so he walked to the bank of a field about a hundred steps away from the teahouse and was suddenly murdered by having his throat cut. His legal tender was also stolen. Afterwards, the wife of the deceased accused Yang Daosheng and Zhang Fucheng, as well as Gao Jinxiang and Gao Alin, uncle and nephew who were lookouts for the teahouse, of conspiring to murder for money. She said that Yang Qiusheng was killed one hundred paces from the teahouse and that the lookouts could not have been unaware of the event. Therefore, the prosecutor arrested Yang Daosheng, Yang Fucheng, and Gao Jinxiang, and prosecuted them for gambling and murder. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Lude opened the court to hear the case. The defendant Yang Daosheng testified that they jointly opened a teahouse and that the villagers played small mahjong games. The daily business was good, earning 1,000 to 2,000 cash, which was divided equally between the two of them. The deceased Yang Qiusheng did not often come to gamble. He said he did not ask Gao Jinxiang and Gao Alin to be lookouts. On the evening of March 29th, which was the 17th day of the Lunar New Year, he didn't know if the deceased came. He sent his oil-bottle son Yang Jingen home and returned home at three or four o'clock. He did not see Yang Qiusheng's body. It was not until five o'clock that a passerby saw it and found out. He had no grudges against Yang Qiusheng and did not know who killed him, and he did not know if the three of them had any grudges against the deceased. Zhang Fucheng also claimed that he did not know and that he lived in Aizhong Bridge, Jiangwan. Gao Jinxiang testified that he was sixty-eight years old and made a living by sewing for the public. He did not act as a lookout and knew nothing about the matter. The judge then questioned the deceased's wife and brother, who testified that the defendants were guilty. The court then summoned witnesses from both sides and adjourned the hearing to a later date. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Organizing a National Goods Banking Syndicate to Hold a Preparatory Meeting

Since the establishment of the Overseas National Goods Joint Operating Company, the financial community, in order to support the development of the national goods industry, has specially organized a National Goods Banking Syndicate. According to a reporter from Dagong News Agency, the organizational matters of the syndicate are still under discussion. Once the details are finalized, the steps for implementation can be decided and a preparatory meeting can be convened to discuss and decide on important issues such as syndicate funds and obligations. Currently, the national goods and financial circles have consulted several times, and the preparatory meeting will be held in Shanghai in the near future.

### "Family Words" is About to be Published

Celebrated women in the women's circle, Yu Huang Qianyi, Zhou Peng Wangquan, Cai Li Jishi Ning, Ye Debin, Mei Niumin Hua, Huang Huang Guibao, Cao Xu Hua, Hu Jiang Siyi, and the General Secretary of the YWCA, Ms. Xie Zuyi, etc., most of whom studied in Europe and America in the past, now either manage their families or devote themselves to women's movements. Considering that domestic women's publications that specifically discuss household management and are substantial in content, and can be used as a reference for virtuous wives and good mothers, are still not widely available, they have specially proposed to publish an irregular publication called "Family Words I," to provide for the reading needs of women across the country. It is understood that the first issue of Family Words will be published within days, with unusually rich topics covering children's education, family medical care, housing, clothing, food, cooking, and literary cultivation, revealing everything. There are also illustrations by famous artists to add to the reader's interest, and the printing is exquisite and the binding is beautiful, especially in terms of remaining matters.

### Shen Junru and Others' Defense Statement (3)

Therefore, at that time, it was believed that the government only needed to express its determination to resist the enemy and save the country, and the regime would easily achieve unity. Moreover, only when the government has a unified regime can it implement resistance to the enemy and save the country and achieve victory. Looking at the All-China National Salvation Association's declaration, after proposing "Establish a unified regime for resisting the enemy," only eight lines later, it continued to explain, "The People's National Salvation Front has no political ambitions, no attempt to seize power, but only wants to fulfill the sacred duty of the people to save the country. We do not help any party to seize leadership, nor do we help any party to fight for legitimacy, but only want to promote a unified regime for resisting the enemy" (see page 5). Further evidence is provided by the statement above, "Its (referring to the central government) leadership position in military and political affairs is not to be worried about" (see page 4), and the statement below, "This is a policy dispute, not a power dispute" (see page 5). On the one hand, it explains the central government's leadership position, and on the other hand, it declares that it not only does not争 seize power itself, but also does not争 for any other party to seize the central leadership position. Isn't it clearly obvious that there is no intention to change the government organization? The indictment ignores the context within the same document, distorts the meaning again and again by taking things out of context, and accuses the defendants of "not recognizing the current government as having the right to rule and wanting to organize another government outside the current government." This is a serious reversal of right and wrong, and the "promoting a unified regime for resisting the enemy" is misinterpreted as "organizing another government." Even in terms of wording, it is completely untenable. Deliberate consideration of the evidence leads to the opposite conclusion, which is not permitted by law. The indictment is deliberately fabricated, and the matter is extremely obvious. Moreover, the above-mentioned views and hopes of the All-China National Salvation Association have long been expressed by the government. Not to mention the declarations of the previous National Congresses and plenary sessions of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, the declaration of the Third Plenary Session in February this year also clearly revealed the national policy of "peaceful reunification," and stated that "only through peace will everyone know to unite sincerely and jointly face the national crisis." It also said, "Since July of last year, the cause of unity has gradually taken shape. Unity is something that was not fully achieved before, and should be completed in the future. Peace is the way to achieve unity." President Jiang's speech at the Central Commemoration Week on July 13th, "Unifying the country and saving the nation" also stated publicly, "In other words, it is for the sake of loving the country, maintaining the internal integrity of the country, demanding the overall awakening and unity, so that in the future everyone can work together harmoniously and unanimously to complete the great cause of resisting foreign aggression and reviving the country. Therefore, we cannot but use the spirit of the Premier to encompass everything and try our best to resolve it peacefully, in order to comfort our Premier and the spirits of our deceased comrades in heaven. Recently, all comrades in the central government naturally have the same mind and the same principle regarding the method of resolving domestic problems, and they have always adhered to the spirit of trustworthiness, peace, and all-encompassing, and used peaceful methods to handle all chaos." Therefore, the purpose and method of the National Salvation Association's suggestion of peaceful reunification is completely in line with President Jiang's statement. Unifying the regime is necessary for resisting the enemy and saving the country, peace is the means to achieve a unified regime, and negotiations between various parties to formulate a common program for resisting the enemy is the method of peaceful reunification. The National Salvation Association's suggestion is clearly in line with the government's fundamental policy. As for whether this method should be adopted, the government has its own discretion. A civilian organization, based on patriotic enthusiasm, has absolutely no illegality in making this suggestion. The indictment, due to its failure to understand the actual political trends, has made a slight error, resulting in a great deviation. Once pointed out, it will naturally be clear. If we look at the actions of the people of the All-China National Salvation Association, the defendants were once elected as representatives to petition the Third Plenary Session, and were received by Central Committee member Ma Chaojun. In addition, the number of petitions to local governments is too many to count. If they did not recognize the government's right to rule, why would they have taken these actions? In addition to the general assembly declaration, other documents of the All-China National Salvation Association also have many places that can be clarified with each other. For example, the first and second pages of the General Assembly Work Review state, "We should have policy disputes with the authorities, but we absolutely do not have power disputes. We are not in agreement on policies. Since we do not fundamentally爭 power, there is no question of agreement or disagreement." The sixth page of "Small Booklet for Unity and Resistance against Aggression" published by Junru Nai Qitaofen and Tao Xingzhi also states, "However, without the leadership of a government, relying solely on the automatic combat of the people will never have a promising future. If the central government does not have the cooperation of local authorities, it is naturally impossible to talk about resisting Japan, but if local authorities are in a state of opposition to the central government, even if they send troops to resist Japan, they may not have a chance of victory." Pages 1 and 2 state that there is hope that the Chairman will personally lead one "million-strong army to launch a national liberation war" (see the first paragraph of the defense reasons). Page 16 states clearly that there is "the right to rule China and the Kuomintang." All of these are sufficient to prove that the conclusions made in the indictment are completely inaccurate. (C) The indictment also states that the aforementioned statements are similar to the Communist Party's letter to the Kuomintang, which states, "We support the establishment of a unified democratic republic of all China" and "Support a unified national defense government of the whole country." However, the All-China National Salvation Association proposed to promote a unified regime for resisting the enemy, while what the Communist Party letter advocates is a unified democratic republic and a national defense government, which clearly refers to the government. Even in terms of wording, there is absolutely no similarity between the two. The indictment actually believes that they are exactly the same, not only failing to clarify the distinction between the government and the regime, but also having a deliberate intention to point a deer and call it a horse. (D) As for the indictment's statement that the various parties mentioned by the defendants are actually placing the Kuomintang in the ranks of various parties, it will be discussed in the three items listed later. It is also pointed out that the Communist Party letter was delivered by Nai Qi to Luo Qing, which does not conform to the facts, and will be explained in detail in the ninth item listed later. The second item of the indictment does not understand the distinction between the government and the regime, ignores the context, and is unaware of the central government's policies and statements. It unjustifiably expands the government's power, which is necessary for the war of resistance, and accuses the defendants of not recognizing the current government's right to rule and wanting to organize a government outside the current government, which is truly a willful and reckless disregard for right and wrong.

### Reflections on the "New Land" Incident and the Prohibition of the Shanghai Student Relief Entertainment Fair

— Luo Qiqing

After the German-Japanese co-produced "New Land," which "promotes puppet organizations and encourages Japanese people to immigrate to the puppet Manchuria," was screened at the Shanghai Donghe Theater for a week, the Shanghai Student Relief Entertainment Fair was prohibited because the program included "singing of the Spring Festival in Guannei and the Guo Guang Min Guang choir," and received a notice from the French Concession police that "all dramas must be suspended, and all songs with anti-Japanese significance should be stopped." These two events, when compared with each other, make us feel the sorrow of national subjugation, even in the concessions that are still our own land. Naturally, our compatriots in the "New Land" (?) which the enemy spent 700,000 Japanese yen to promote to the world, will suffer what kind of humiliation!

Regarding "New Land," due to protests from all walks of life, the Film Censorship Committee of the Public Works Department ordered the deletion of four points, including the words "Manchukuo," "Map of Manchukuo," "Bombing of the Great Wall," and "Japanese Soldier Sentry," but according to a report from a member of the Hongkou District at a meeting of the Lianhehui the other day, the film only deleted one or two points (but according to a friend who has seen the film, although the written words "Manchukuo" and "Map of Manchukuo" have been deleted, the pronunciation on the soundtrack still remains). Therefore, they requested that a letter be forwarded to the Public Works Department and the Japanese Consulate to lodge a serious protest, in order to stop it. Now that we cannot disrupt the theater showing the film and burn "New Land" like the Italian soldiers did to the "Abyssinian Film," even though it has aroused the anger of our national people, we can only wait quietly for negotiations and retreat to the way of "preserving wholeness by sacrificing fragments."

What about the Shanghai Student Entertainment Fair? After receiving the notice of prohibition, "the Preparatory Committee of the fair tried to earnestly negotiate with the French Police, but to no avail. They reluctantly suspended the meeting, closed the gate of the theater (Yameng Grand Theater) at one o'clock in the afternoon, and posted a notice stating that the date would be postponed. At the same time, the Preparatory Committee convened a Standing Committee meeting and decided to continue negotiations with the French Concession authorities, hoping to hold the event within the 20th of this month. If the French Concession authorities still insist on their original proposal, they will decide to hold it in the Chinese area or the Public Concession." We can only wait and see what the outcome of this "negotiation" will be.

However, what is the situation of our compatriots in Guandong, who are in deep water and fire? According to yesterday's (9th) report from our newspaper's Tianjin correspondent: In recent months, the news of our country's unity has spread throughout the four northeastern provinces. All oppressed youths believe that the motherland (note the words "motherland") is hopeful, and they have secretly engaged in collective national restoration movements. The new Japanese military police in the puppet territory are very busy with detection and are extremely strict with the inspection of letters and telegrams. Last month, the Harbin Harmonica Association was inspected by the Japanese military police for communication with Guannei, and anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese evidence was found. More than ten people, including Chen Baoluo, the translator of the Atlantic Cinema, were arrested one after another and imprisoned in the Japanese military police team, where they were subjected to harsh torture. It is said that several people have already died from unbearable torture. However, although the Japanese puppets have suppressed and prevented them in this way, they still cannot stop the vigorous patriotic movement among the people. The righteous army on the border of Jilin and Heilongjiang, hearing the news in mid-February that the motherland was preparing to recover lost territory, rose up to organize the righteous army and secretly arranged for internal response, with no end in sight.

In the "New Land" (?), naturally they have been deprived of even the right to "negotiate." They can only be oppressed, searched, and subjected to brutal torture. However, this still "cannot stop the vigorous patriotic movement among the people." They "all believe that the motherland is hopeful" and "organize the righteous army and arrange for internal response" regardless of hardship, causing "the Japanese puppets to be very panicked." Indeed, only "children without a motherland" know how lovely the "motherland" is, but do we really have to wait until we have no "motherland" before we stand up and "prefer to be shattered like jade"? I want to ask every one of the "people who do not want to be slaves"!

### Seeking the Path

— Ye Jiayi

I am a path seeker. Like a blind ant scurrying around in the grass!

When I was young, a gentleman I did not know gave me many lessons that my meager mind could not tolerate, but from his rich words, I was satisfied and carefree about my future. I was full of youthful enthusiasm, and I felt how brilliant the world before me was!

"Child, don't cry, go forward bravely, your path will be vast, and you will discover an oasis in the desert. Strive."

From then on, I began to walk. I love myself, and I love mankind. I also told others to walk my path. However, year after year, I found that my journey gradually became narrower and narrower until it was exhausted. I walked into a dangerous and steep valley, and there were no companions around me!

On the desolate road, I was hungry, thirsty, and tired, my heart trembling and my body frightened, but I remembered the words of my gentleman: "That is a necessary journey, but you must be more courageous."

I walked, lonely, walked, and endured: finally, again and again, my legs went weak, as if I remembered many whips lashing me into a daze, and many beasts attacking my only path. Gradually, I climbed up again, but my wounded body finally fell down again: moreover, the journey before me was covered by sand blown by the hurricane! Desert, hot, stuffy, and desolate desert.

——Madman——stubborn madman. Someone was looking at me with such contempt and saying.

——How pitiful! A lonely child! Some people also pitied me and said.

I was suspicious, I calmed down, I looked at a hot sun in the sky, I considered my path, but I believed I was not lost! So I was angry, and I stubbornly lifted my heavy steps, struggling on the journey with all my strength. I wanted to climb the peak I hoped for and make those who laughed at me with ridicule open their eyes.

The difficult road gradually became more and more abrupt. There were no fragrant flowers, nor any green grass to comfort my heart. But there were human bones scattered on the most dangerous side of the road. The sky was also dim, and the sun finally disappeared, silent like a battlefield after a war.

——That is the road of death, and someone else instructed me like this.

——Come back quickly. I seemed to hear the shouts of those companions who had walked with me before.

The front was hazy and endless, so I could no longer believe in myself…………

I came back, and the return journey was so short.

I came back, but in the end, I could not survive among those people!

The people of this world all despised me and secretly laughed at my stupidity. They were triumphant seeing me coming back in vain. So they rejected me everywhere, and all creation was against me. I could not confide in anyone, not even a flower, because these all belonged to their group.

I am still a lonely and depressed person! But I did not sob.

This world is indeed hot and stuffy, not only with fragrant flowers and fine wine, but also with unimaginable wonders. They indulge in smelling this allegedly fragrant breath, singing the allegedly mellow fine wine, but I see them all falling down in batches like mayflies, and no one ever gets up again! No one in their lively world cares about this fate!

I felt ashamed and suffocated! So I pitied them with the pity they had for me, each of them lost their souls and fell down without taking a step!

In a state of bewilderment and sorrow, I remembered the words of another gentleman:

"Young ones, carry the blessings of your unfortunate but happy parents in your hearts and go on a journey through the world. The future is vast, and it is also dim. But do not be afraid, for there will be a path in front of the fearless."

I, I am still a path seeker.

### First Time in the Dissection Room

— Ya Min

Entering the dissection room for the first time, I felt overwhelmed with constraint and timidity, a rapid, light thumping in my chest.

My newly made work coat was stiff with starch, the tight cuffs and collar making me uncomfortable. I had new anatomy books, new dissection instruments. The new work coat made a rustling sound as I walked through the door of the dissection hall, and the blood rushed faster in my veins.

The corridors were filled with the smell of decaying corpses and the pungent odor of preservatives. Leaning against the wall in the corridor waiting for the door to open, we newly minted medical students lost the childlike habit of joking around that we usually displayed when meeting. Restraining the smile on our faces, we also restrained the slight tremor in our hearts. We constantly glanced down at our new outfits, touching the thick books under our arms and the wooden box containing the dissection tools.

The door opened. The last professor to arrive at the dissection hall was the first to enter the room; it could be called a ritual, or perhaps everyone was hesitant to step forward. Don't laugh at the female classmates who were hiding behind others as if playing hide-and-seek; didn't I also summon my courage to enter this gloomy room?

The corpses were already laid out on the dissection tables, the white cloths covering them having been removed. The room was dark: the pungent smell of alcohol and "Formalin," and the peculiar odor of the corpses, filled the air, irritating our unaccustomed sense of smell and sight. A worker pulled open the black curtains on the windows (I truly wondered why this deathly color was chosen for the curtains, creating the cold, damp gloom of a cemetery in this room). One by one, the naked corpses were revealed in the glaring sunlight; their skin was a parched, brown color; some eyes were half-closed, glaring at people with resentment. The most terrifying thing was the tightly clenched teeth, exposed between the gray lips, making one unable to suppress a shiver.

I took out the dazzling silver scalpel, tweezers, and curved-tipped scissors; the book was also opened on the stand. Several people in the same group surrounded a corpse, looking at each other face to face, but no one dared to make the first cut. The female classmates, although restraining their panic, also felt a surge of shyness (they were still unaccustomed to a completely naked member of the opposite sex). They kept hiding behind others, fearfully but also tentatively glancing at the corpse.

The professor made a trial cut for us as a model, then walked around in the crowd, supervising. Gaining courage, I put my hand on the dry, withered skin of the corpse, and a cold sensation, like a small snake, crawled into my fingers. Thus emboldened, I held the knife in one hand and the tweezers in the other, and began to cut as the professor had done.

The knife and tweezers in my hand were clumsy, like an inexperienced boatman who didn't know how to maneuver his pole. These delicate instruments became heavy and awkward in my hands. Has anyone ever hesitated when using a knife and fork for the first time at the dinner table? I now feel the same embarrassment. My hand was shaking slightly, and it was difficult to pierce the skin with the sharp blade.

I cannot describe the slowness of time; it felt like a long time, but the clock tower had not yet signaled the end of class. One arm of the corpse had become blurred and indistinct under my hands, but I had not yet found the several types of tissues that should be there according to the book. The most awkward moment was when the professor stood behind me, his breath feeling like a burning pressure on my neck, making my face and neck flush. My hands became even more clumsy and disobedient. Fortunately, the professor was more tolerant of beginners; he simply smiled and walked away, without pointing out my mistakes. But I felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted, and I felt relieved.

Finally, I waited until the cuckoo-like double ringing of the end-of-class bell, packed up my books and tools, and walked out of the main door. The air was fresh, and I took a deep breath, exchanging an understanding smile with each companion who walked past me.
