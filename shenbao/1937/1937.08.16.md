### Our Troops, Immersed in Blood, Resist Aggression and Charge the Enemy Lines; We Have Surrounded the Enemy's Base

Yesterday Morning We Captured the Japanese Naval Club; Our Air Force Again Displayed Its Power in Bombing; Enemy Troops Along the Songhu Road Were Forced to Retreat Into the Concession; Enemy Troops Are Reinforcing, and We Are Prepared to Deal Them a Head-on Blow

Since the prelude to the great battle of Shanghai was unveiled, the Japanese army has consistently adopted a defensive posture, relying on solid fortifications. Our army, seeking to eliminate the stubborn enemy as soon as possible, has had to adopt an offensive strategy. Therefore, starting from the morning before yesterday (the 14th), orders were given to deploy the air force to assist soldiers on the entire front line, carrying out intense bombing and attacks, posing a significant threat to the strong enemy. Until noon yesterday, the fierce battle had lasted for more than twenty hours. Enemy and our troops charged through blood for more than ten times. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and their bases in the front and rear of Jiangwan Road and Yangshupu were completely surrounded by our troops. Yesterday morning, the Japanese Naval Club was recaptured by us. At the same time, enemy troops south of Dongbaoxing Road, north of Songhu Railway Station, and east of the railway line were also forced by our army to retreat into the concession area. From 1 p.m. onward, the battle gradually subsided, and although the sound of gunfire could still be heard intermittently, it was not very intense. After dusk and until 4 a.m. this morning, it became even quieter, as if it had entered a state of rest. Also, yesterday our air force, despite the overcast sky and all-day rain, still bravely went out to display its power and carry out bombing in the enemy's positions from time to time. Although enemy ships continuously fired with anti-aircraft guns and enemy aircraft attacked several times, several air battles occurred, but we were never damaged. The enemy army, having suffered setbacks and significant losses for days, has telegraphed its home country for reinforcements in order to put up a stubborn resistance. However, our authorities are determined, morale is high, and we are fully prepared and will have no difficulty in dealing them a head-on blow. Now, the battle situation on all sides yesterday is reported as follows:

We Occupied the Japanese Naval Club

According to the official report, yesterday (the 15th) at 9:30 a.m., our army occupied the Japanese Naval Club. A certain company commander of our regiment was wounded but refused to retreat and continued to advance bravely. We drove back the enemy troops. In this battle, we suffered more than twenty soldiers killed or wounded, and the enemy suffered more than two hundred soldiers killed or wounded.

After a day of bloody battle the day before, our army's left flank had advanced to Yangshupu, surrounding the Japanese army headquarters at the Gongda Yarn Factory. The right flank advanced to Jiangwan Road and North Sichuan Road, surrounding the command headquarters of the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces. At the same time, the air force was dispatched to bomb them, and after being attacked from above and below, the enemy troops were in a terrible state. Yesterday morning, the two sides engaged in artillery battles once. Under the cover of artillery fire, our army launched a fierce attack on the direction of Baole'an Road on North Sichuan Road at 9:30 a.m. yesterday, and occupied the Japanese Naval Club. Then, at about 12:30 p.m., our army in Zhabei attacked Sichuan Road again, and the fierce battle was intense. The sound of artillery and machine guns could be clearly heard in the special zone, lasting for about half an hour before stopping.

A reporter from the Central News Agency went to the front line yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. in heavy rain, and returned to Shanghai at 11 p.m. after meeting with a certain senior officer. According to the conversation, after our army eliminated the enemy troops in the Shuishui Road area four days ago, they took advantage of the advance. On the 15th, they crossed the Patriotic Girls' School and approached the Japanese Naval Club at the end of North Sichuan Road. Our army bravely advanced under dense rain of bullets. A certain company commander of a certain division took the lead, was shot and wounded. The soldiers planned to support him in retreat. The company commander was extremely loyal and courageous, disregarded his own safety and struggled to advance with his injuries. The morale was even more boosted and they fought to advance through blood. At 9:30 a.m., the Japanese Naval Club was occupied. More than 300 enemy troops defending the area were completely annihilated. The enemy troops launched a fierce counterattack south of the Japanese Naval Club at 2:10 p.m., and engaged in several hand-to-hand combats, but were bravely repelled by our army. The enemy suffered heavy casualties.

Our Army Encircled the Enemy Base

A report at 3:30 p.m. yesterday stated that the fighting continued through the night in heavy rain. At dawn yesterday morning (the day before yesterday), the sound of artillery and machine guns was particularly intense. After 7 a.m. until the date of publication, it was in a state of silence, with only occasional bombings. It was reported that our army on Jiangwan Road bravely attacked and made considerable progress, advancing from the Shuishui Road Zhizhi University area to the Jiangwan Road intersection, approaching the enemy's headquarters. In the Yangshupu area, our army approached the Gongda Yarn Factory and formed an encirclement. The remaining enemies resisted stubbornly and defended to the death, and are still in a stalemate.

Two Armies Confront Each Other on Old Bazili Road

Since yesterday, the traffic between the concession area and Zhabei, except for Red Cross ambulances or fire engines from various districts of the concession, could pass through the concession area east of the New Rubbish Bridge via the Old Rubbish Bridge, Old Zhabei Bridge, Pentang Nong Bridge, Tianhou Palace Bridge, Tap Water Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, to Waibaidu Bridge. However, the west side of the New Rubbish Bridge belonged to the junction of Chinese and concession areas, with the Suzhou River as the boundary. In the past few days, it was still possible to travel back and forth by boat shuttle, but yesterday only the ferry from Zhabei to the concession was allowed, and no ferry from the concession to Zhabei was allowed. Even if someone secretly crossed, once the security team or police noticed, they would stop them from landing. In order to understand the battle line between the Chinese and Japanese armies, the reporter specially went there at about 9 a.m. in the rain. Going through Beijing Road, the reporter saw that the river banks along North Suzhou Road from Sichuan Road Bridge to Waibaidu Bridge were completely guarded by Japanese soldiers. Every bridge from the north of Sichuan Road Bridge past the Post Office to the New Rubbish Bridge was guarded by Western soldiers. The reporter wanted to go to Zhabei via Sichuan Road Bridge, Tap Water Bridge, and Tianhou Palace Bridge, but was unable to do so. Later, the reporter went to Zhabei at Pentang Nong Bridge, and turned into the intersection of North Henan Road and Qipu Road. The reporter saw machine guns and small steel cannons set up on the small vegetable market there. Our army confronted the Japanese army on Wuchang Road at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Bazili Road. There were no pedestrians on the road, and it was empty. At around 10:30 a.m., a street sweeper in Taoyuanfang was holding a broom and was about to go out to sweep the road. Unexpectedly, he was shot twice in vital areas by Japanese soldiers and immediately fell to the ground. Later, an ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital. Also, near the Post Office at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Tiantong Road, there were two trolleybuses, Route 17 and Route 21. It was heard that when the trolleybuses passed there the day before yesterday morning, they encountered a fierce battle between Chinese and Japanese cars firing machine guns, so the drivers and passengers abandoned the cars and fled.

A Fierce Battle Before the Bazili Bridge

The day before yesterday (14th), after our air force dispatched for the second time at about 4 p.m., our army also launched a full-line attack at the same time, especially on the lines of Pudong and Bazili Bridge, which were the most intense. According to wounded soldiers who had retreated from the front line, they had been ordered by their superiors to attack the enemy troops on Jiangwan Road at 4 p.m. on the day before yesterday. "We belong to a certain company, and we followed a certain company commander in bravely shouting and charging. The enemy troops relied on fortifications and concentrated machine gun firepower to stubbornly resist. After a bloody battle of more than an hour, the enemy finally could not hold on and retreated, and our army was able to occupy a certain place east of the Bazili Bridge. A certain company commander was wounded (from Xuzhou) and has now retreated to the rear for treatment. The enemy also suffered heavy casualties, but the exact numbers are unknown.

According to another report, when our army made a bloody charge in the Bazili Bridge area the night before, a certain regimental commander Wu Qiuzhao and regimental deputy Zhang Zhige took the lead and were extremely brave. They were once in an extremely critical situation, but they were still unwilling to retreat, and finally waited for reinforcements from the rear to catch up, continue the attack, and complete their intended purpose.

Enemy Ships Opened Fire and Bombarded Pudong

Yesterday morning at about 6 a.m., the reconnaissance plane of the Izumo flagship parked in the Huangpu River in front of the Japanese Consulate again dispatched to scout our areas of Pudong and Nanshi, circling back and forth for about twenty minutes. When it was scouting Pudong, it even strafed with machine guns. Our troops stationed in Pudong immediately returned fire with machine guns for defense. The enemy plane could not hold on and flew back high. Until about 2 p.m., the enemy plane appeared over Pudong again. At the same time, the Izumo enemy ship opened fire and bombarded the Dongchang Road and Xinma Road areas of Pudong, with more than a dozen rounds. The local police force calmly dealt with it, and there was no damage. Our defenses there are now very strict, so there is no cause for concern.

A Fierce Battle Will Take Place at Dawn This Morning

After a night of fierce fighting and occupying the Japanese Naval Club, the battle on the front line has temporarily subsided. No sound of artillery has been heard until midnight. The air battle at 3 p.m. was not as intense as the day before. However, the curfew in the concession area, coupled with the cold wind and rain, made the scene in Shanghai even more desolate. It is heard that the Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties and significant loss of strength in the continuous battles, and is on the verge of collapse. Our side has suffered fewer casualties. Only more than 30 wounded soldiers from the front line have been brought back for treatment. The enemy fleet commander Hasegawa is begging for help from Tokyo in a critical situation. Part of the Kurume Division has arrived. Our front line has also increased its troops and is waiting in battle formation, vowing to inflict heavy losses on the invaders. According to a certain military officer, our side has not yet issued a general offensive order. According to general observation, there should be an unprecedented fierce battle at dawn.

The Kume Division Joins the Battle

According to reliable reports yesterday, the enemy has been telegraphing its home country for help due to the heavy setbacks suffered by our army in the past few days. Late the day before yesterday, the Kume Division had arrived in Shanghai, and yesterday it had joined the front line battle. Also, at about 2 p.m. yesterday, a part of the enemy army reinforced the south side of the Naval Club and launched a fierce attack on us, but was repelled by our army.

Japanese Troops Landed in the Gaoqiao Area

At 8:30 p.m. last night, according to reliable sources, it was said that at about 8 p.m. last night, a part of the Japanese army secretly crossed the river by boat and landed in the Gaoqiao area, apparently with a major plot, but our side has taken strict precautions.

The Japanese Naval Landing Forces landed at the Qichang Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau in Pudong at 10 a.m. yesterday morning, and put out sentries. Our army received the report and also sent troops to take a surrounding position, waiting for an opportunity to attack.

Japanese Reinforcements Arrive in Shanghai One After Another

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Japanese army, which has been fighting in the Hongkou area of the concession, has been fiercely resisted by our army for days. Our army has been advancing step by step, and the Japanese army's front line has been gradually shortened. Hasegawa, commander of the 3rd Japanese Naval Fleet stationed in Shanghai, has urgently telegraphed his home country for help.

Japanese Warships Are Being Mobilized Extremely Busily

According to the Central News Agency, the total number of Japanese warships moored in Shanghai as of now is 26. The afternoon before yesterday, another Japanese torpedo boat entered the port. Yesterday (15th) at 1 a.m., three more Japanese gunboats entered the port, and at 8:50 a.m. and 8:55 a.m., two more torpedo boats entered the port one after another. It was then learned that the three gunboats that entered the port at one o'clock had exited through the Yangshupu Wharf at 4:30 a.m., 4:45 a.m., and 5:05 a.m. one after another. In addition, a Japanese ship carried Japanese expatriates out of the port at 5:10 a.m. yesterday morning. Another gunboat traveled back and forth inside and outside the Huangpu River, which was very busy. Yesterday morning, the ship left the port at 8:10 a.m. and returned at 10:10 a.m.

The Enemy Army Plans to Land in Changshu

According to a reconnaissance report yesterday, seven enemy ships suddenly came to Yanglinkou and Baimaokou in Changshu, carrying a large number of marines, and appeared to be landing in the river area there. However, our troops stationed there have taken strict precautions, and if the enemy troops land, they will be dealt a head-on blow.

According to the Central News Agency, seven Japanese ships arrived at Xuxingjingkou in Changshu yesterday, and the marines had a landing attempt. However, our garrison has a strong force, and if the enemy lands, they will be dealt a head-on blow. The river defense is extremely solid.

The Enemy's Airfield Construction Was Destroyed by Us

The enemy's attempt to build an airfield near the golf course near the Fish Market has indeed been destroyed by us. The enemy is trying to build another airfield elsewhere. We have already detected it and are trying to prevent it.

According to reliable news from Pudong, the Japanese army is now forcibly recruiting civilians in the eastern part of Chuansha, outside Hengsha, to build and open an airfield as its air force base.

The Morale of the Front Is Extremely High

Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency went to the front line to inspect and witnessed that the morale of our army was extremely high and the defenses were solid, which was very inspiring. However, the front line has difficulty in supplying provisions, and it is hoped that the people in the rear will donate more food and supplies to comfort our loyal and brave soldiers.

Madam Chiang Kai-shek Comforts the Frontline Soldiers

Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, was very pleased to learn that our army was fighting bravely in Shanghai, and she specially sent a telegram to the frontline soldiers yesterday, commending them highly, and planned to raise a large number of comfort goods and transport them to the front.

Zhang Zhizhong and Others Inspect the Front Line

Zhang Zhizhong, commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison, and Yang Hu, commander of the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison, went to inspect various positions on the front line on the 14th, and the morale was greatly boosted.

The British Consulate Moved to a New Location to Work

In the past two days, because our air force bombed the Izumo flagship, which used the concession to shell our army, the air battles over the Bund and Waibaidu Bridge were extremely fierce for days. The British Consulate in Shanghai, located at the foot of Waibaidu Bridge, was in the line of fire. In order to avoid accidental injury, it moved its important documents and items to the Hamilton Building on Jiangxi Road using cargo trucks yesterday for office work. It is reported that many British troops are stationed in the British Consulate, and the Soviet Embassy, ​​the German Consulate, and other buildings near the Japanese Consulate are said to have similar preparations.

The French Concession Decided to Implement Air Defense

Since the unfortunate event of a bomb accidentally falling and exploding in front of the Great World, the French Consul-General ordered the French Concession Police Department yesterday morning to implement air defense immediately. In the future, the French Police Department will implement emergency protection for aircraft engaged in combat activities found in the high altitude of the French Concession.

### A Great Battle in a Rainstorm; Our Air Force Displays Its Power

Bombarding the Izumo Ship, Posing a Significant Threat; Engaging in Two Fierce Battles With Enemy Aircraft in Western Shanghai

At around 5:30 a.m. yesterday morning, a reconnaissance plane took off from the Japanese flagship Izumo, circled over the ship several times, and then flew to the Zhabei, Pudong, North Railway Station, Macartney Road, and other areas to scout. After about twenty minutes, the plane flew over the two concessions to the Nanshi area. It flew very high, as if fearing bombardment by our army. Before long, it flew east along the Huangpu River to scout the Suzhou River. In total, it took about forty minutes before flying to Songkou.

At 1 p.m., an air battle between the Chinese and Japanese air forces occurred over the area of North Zhejiang Road in Qipu Road. The sound of planes was noisy, and the sound of gunfire was rapid, but it left in a moment.

At about 2 p.m., a Japanese plane flew in from the southeast corner to scout the area around the North Railway Station, and dropped bombs. At that time, our army used anti-aircraft guns to bombard it. The enemy plane dropped a bomb in a hasty escape, and it fell into Qingchangli East Alley, opposite the North District Elementary School of the Public Works Department on Ke Neng Hai Road, injuring six people. The recovered fragments of the bomb were sent to the Public Works Department by the Huishi Police Station and the volunteers there.

At 3:10 p.m., an enemy plane flew quickly from the northwest sky to the east. One of our planes was chasing closely behind, and they fired at each other with machine guns for a while. The sound of gunfire was fierce, and the roofs near Qipu Road had stray bullets. At the same time, the Japanese anti-aircraft guns in Hongkou opened fire to attack, but it did not work. Our plane returned safely. Since then, the Chinese and Japanese air forces have been dispatched again to scout, but there have been no fierce battles. Enemy planes also flew to Pudong for activity at about 2 p.m.

At about 3:30 p.m., a plane from our side flew to Songkou to scout the movements of Japanese ships, and frequently bombarded the Japanese flagship Izumo. At that time, the ship and the 600 plainclothes Japanese soldiers stationed in the Rihua Yarn Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, urgently used anti-aircraft guns to attack our plane, firing no less than a hundred rounds, but our soldiers treated the danger as if it was nothing, and still bombarded the ship fiercely, and strafed downward with machine guns. Therefore, the surface of the Huangpu River was frequently in fierce battle, and the sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. After about twenty minutes, our plane turned back in the rainstorm. However, at this time, a Japanese plane suddenly rose from the Songkou area and chased after it. At the same time, the anti-aircraft guns set up on the roof of the Japanese-owned Zhengjin Bank and the Nisshin Shipping Company on the Bund also fired at the same time. Our plane was brave and agile, and immediately turned to meet the enemy plane for battle. It met twice west of Jing'an Temple and in the southwestern corner of the French Concession, where it borders the Chinese Concession, and then two fierce battles occurred over those two places. At that time, both planes flew very high, but the sound of machine guns could still be heard clearly on the ground, and it lasted for more than twenty minutes before it stopped. As a result, the two planes flew to the east and west respectively. However, when there was a fierce battle in the air, stray bullets injured people in many places. At the entrance of Jing'an Villa on Jing'an Temple Road, on the sidewalk in front of the new shop next door to the east, a carriage driver also had his left leg broken by stray bullets, and blood flowed like rain, accumulating into a pool. The glass window of the shop was close at hand, but it was completely unharmed. So-called lucky and unlucky, the injured carriage driver, named Zhang Wencai, lived at No. 9 Hong'anfang, McGregory Road, and his injuries were very serious, and his life was in danger. Then, an ambulance was seen continuing to transport an injured person, covered in blood, and already unconscious, who had also been injured by stray bullets nearby. At the same time, another man was seen tied to an operating bed, frequently irrigated with red potion, and his condition seemed very difficult to bear. After careful examination, it turned out to be a drunkard who was still living a life of drunken dreams, which is really sighing.

At 4:05 p.m. yesterday, Zhang Yunsheng, a 13-year-old boy from Zhenjiang, resident of No. 42 Jialu Road, French Concession, was buying biscuits to satisfy his hunger in front of the Deshin Jingguang Grocery Store at No. 48 Jialu Road, when he was hit in the head by a stray Japanese machine gun bullet, and his brains splattered, killing him instantly.

### Shanghai Consuls Visited Mayor Yu Twice to Discuss the Security of the Concession

If the Japanese Ship Izumo Leaves the Concession, Our Side Can Consider Not Bombing It; Initial Meeting; The Japanese Again Installed Anti-Aircraft Machine Guns on the Bank of Taiwan Building

Initial Meeting

Yesterday morning, the consuls-general of various countries stationed in Shanghai sent a representative leading consul to visit Mayor Yu, and put forward the following two points: ㊀ The consuls of various countries in Shanghai have considered Mayor Yu's statement the day before regarding the Japanese army's use of the concession as a military base, and will warn the Japanese side, but the attitude of the consuls of various countries is that if either party harms the lives and property of foreigners in the concession, the parties concerned should still be responsible; ㊁ The consuls of various countries believe that the flight of Chinese aircraft over the concession endangers the safety of the concession, and specially raised a protest. Mayor Yu immediately refuted, stating that, regarding the first point, all friendly countries should strictly maintain neutrality in the Sino-Japanese War, but they have allowed the Japanese to use the concession as a military base, which has fundamentally violated the principle of strict neutrality. Since the countries cannot stop the Japanese side, our troops naturally have the right to take necessary actions for self-defense, and therefore, they cannot be responsible for all the consequences. Regarding the second point, all countries must know that the concession is our country's territory, and the airspace of the concession is our country's airspace. The right to airspace is a part of our country's sovereignty. Our air force's flight in our own airspace does not allow others to interfere at all. Moreover, the purpose of the flight is to eliminate enemy ships that use the concession as a military base, and the countries should not interfere even more. Mayor Yu continued, according to reliable reports, the roofs of several Japanese banks and commercial firms in the concession are equipped with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, but the concession authorities do not interfere, which is very regrettable. This mayor specially took this opportunity to raise a protest. If they do not pay attention to stopping it, our air force will be afraid of bombing these buildings, which are not for combat but are actually used for combat. If an unfortunate result occurs at that time, the responsibility should be borne jointly by the concession authorities and the Japanese side. The two sides talked for an hour, and the leading consul then took his leave. Mayor Yu asked him if he had protested to the Japanese side, and he said that he was going there now.

Second Meeting

The leading consul of the Shanghai Consular Corps, Norwegian Consul General Ol, convened a meeting of the consular corps at noon yesterday after visiting the mayor. Regarding the protest raised by the municipal government that anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns were set up on the roofs of Japanese commercial banks and Japanese shops in the concession to attack Chinese aircraft, he ordered the Public Works Department to investigate in detail, but did not find the above facts. At the same time, after the consular corps questioned the Japanese Consulate General, the Japanese Consul General also replied that there were no such anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns on the roofs of Japanese buildings. At 4:30 p.m., Consul General Ol visited Mayor Yu again to report the progress, and said that he could invite Chinese officials to conduct a joint investigation, but when the investigation was completed and proved that there were no above facts, the municipal government should be asked to issue a public statement. Mayor Yu immediately said that, regarding what your leading consul said, the British Consulate General here has already received a notice this morning, saying that the police have searched and there is no such thing, so this mayor currently trusts the report of the British Consulate and believes that there is no need to send personnel to investigate for the time being. If it is discovered again in the future, it will be notified again. Ol continued, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Okamoto, is now expressing to the consular corps that Japanese military aircraft can not fly to the south bank of the Suzhou River, and hopes that your mayor can make the same expression. Mayor Yu immediately replied that the right to the airspace of the concession belongs to our country, so the Chinese air force's flight in the airspace of the concession is absolutely not subject to any restrictions, but if the consular corps can make the Japanese Izumo flagship stationed outside the scope of the concession, then for the sake of maintaining the safety of the concession, it is willing to convey the request of various friendly countries to the military authorities for consideration.

According to another reporter's investigation, the Japanese again installed ten anti-aircraft machine guns on the Bank of Taiwan building on Er Ma Road yesterday.

### Japanese Air Force Raids Capital Yesterday

Sixteen Heavy Bombers Flew from Taipei. Our Air Force Bravely Engaged in Battle for Two Hours. Six Enemy Planes Were Shot Down, and the Remaining Ten Fled. Only Minor Damage from Scattered Bomb Hits in the City.

[Nanjing] At half past three in the afternoon on the 15th, sixteen enemy planes attacked and bombed the capital in two waves. Our air force immediately took off to engage them head-on. Military police, government organs, and protective personnel were mobilized upon hearing the alert to maintain order. Citizens, upon hearing the alert, followed the instructions of the military police and remained extremely calm. During the first attack, aerial combat lasted for over an hour before the enemy was repelled, around 3:30 PM. About half an hour later, the enemy planes attacked a second time, first with machine guns. Our air force fought bravely, and anti-aircraft guns fired from all directions. By 5:00 PM, they were also driven back, pursued between Fangshan and Jurong. We shot down four enemy planes; two were destroyed outside Zhonghua Gate and Guanghua Gate. A total of seven bombs were dropped by enemy planes near Tongji Gate and Ming Palace, causing several casualties. The roofs of the Continental Bank and Miao Ji Company in Xinjiekou sustained minor damage from machine-gun fire. The shot-down enemy planes have been photographed and preserved. Investigations revealed they were manufactured by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding. The 250-kilogram bombs they dropped had their casings partially cracked. After a small plane was shot down by us, five enemy airmen died. Afterward, investigations at various hospitals showed that nine people were admitted to the Central Hospital, three to the Xiaguan Infectious Disease Hospital (including one severely injured), two to the Fengfu Road Health Affairs Office, and ten to the Houchengqiao Office. The patients at Meitan Port were treated by Bo'ai Hospital, all with minor injuries. Several dozen people died near the First Park. (15th Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] For days, Japanese planes have repeatedly bombed and raided various locations. At noon on the 15th, sixteen Japanese heavy bombers raided our capital. Fortunately, our air defense authorities and air force personnel were prepared and responded appropriately. Citizens remained calm and composed, without panic. In the two-hour air battle, we emerged victorious, shooting down as many as six enemy planes, with only ten escaping. Although several locations within the city were hit, the damage was minimal. Each enemy plane is said to be worth 500,000 Japanese yen. The material losses are already considerable, not to mention the casualties among the flight crews. The enemy planes flew from the air force base in Taipei, Taiwan. Our air defense authorities received reports as soon as they flew into Zhejiang province, and an alert was issued at 1:30 PM. At the same time, two fighter planes were dispatched to scout. At 1:55 PM, the enemy planes reached the airspace over Nanjing. We immediately sent a large number of fighter planes to engage them in combat around the Dajiaochang area of Nanjing. The battle was intense for a time, and the enemy planes were repeatedly suppressed before flying back into the city, dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns in several locations. Our planes pursued and engaged them, and anti-aircraft guns and machine guns throughout the city fired at the enemy planes. Seeing their efforts thwarted, the enemy planes fled out of the city. We continued to pursue them, engaging in fierce combat again between Dajiaochang and Jurong. As a result, six enemy planes were shot down, four of them falling in the suburbs of Nanjing and two near Jurong. The remaining ten enemy planes fled in disarray to the southeast at 3:20 PM. The alert was lifted at 3:30 PM. During this engagement, our air force personnel bravely fought off the enemy. Cai Shichang returned wounded, and his plane was damaged. Chen Youwei's whereabouts are unknown. The entire city expressed admiration for the bravery of our air force personnel. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] At 2:00 PM today, Japanese planes attacked the capital, and Chinese planes took off to engage them. This was the first time the capital had been subjected to an air raid. The enemy planes dropped bombs on places like the Ming Palace airfield, causing thick smoke to rise into the air. The raid lasted half an hour, with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns firing simultaneously. The enemy planes then fled south, but Chinese planes remained in the sky for a while to guard against further attacks. During the attack, four enemy planes flew low over the Reuters news agency office, and fragments of bombs fell into the courtyard. Half an hour before the enemy planes arrived, the entire city had sounded the alarm. Police, military police, rescue teams, and fire brigades were all prepared. Members of the civic training corps were also stationed on the corners of various streets. Residents of the capital had never seen an air raid before, so they did not perceive the danger. While the aerial combat was taking place, many were still chatting and laughing. Once the alarm sounded, all traffic stopped. When the all-clear signal was given, the entire city immediately returned to normal. It is reported that there were no casualties among the residents. A Reuters reporter toured the entire city and saw that two bombs had fallen on the Ming Palace airfield and five bombs had fallen outside Guanghua Gate. There was no major damage to either location. The enemy planes were sixteen three-engine German Heinkel bombers, divided into three groups. They reportedly came from Taipei, taking three hours to reach the capital. The bombs they dropped weighed 250 and 500 kilograms. It is said that six were shot down. It is now believed that two caught fire and fell east of the Guanghua Gate airfield, three were destroyed at Fangshan near Lishui, and one was destroyed in the mountains. A Reuters reporter witnessed one falling near the Guanghua Gate airfield. The people inside were burned beyond recognition. Villagers scrambled to collect pieces of the plane as souvenirs. (Reuters Dispatch from Central News Agency, 15th)

[Nanjing] On the 15th, Japanese planes raided Nanjing for an hour and a half, dropping a total of eleven bombs. Six bombs fell in the southern suburbs, one of which did not explode, causing only minor damage. Five bombs fell inside the city, one of which also failed to explode, slightly damaging some houses. Only a few residents were injured by machine-gun fire from the enemy planes, and their injuries were not serious. The enemy planes that raided Nanjing on the 15th were all Type 96 land-based attack aircraft manufactured by the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Nagoya Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, each worth between 300,000 and 500,000 Japanese yen. One of the planes shot down five miles outside Nanjing, identified as "Mitsubishi No. 41," was personally inspected by a reporter, who found a copper plate on the destroyed wing with the manufacturer's identification and aircraft number. All five people inside died from their injuries after landing. Name tags were found on their bodies, identifying them as "Ito Toshitada," "Akimoto," "Sakurai," "Tanaka Shohei," and "Naritasan." Each carried a Buddhist amulet from Naritasan Shinshoji Temple, and their hat brims bore the words "Kisarazu Naval Air Corps." Some had photos and letters from their beloved wives hidden in their pockets, stained with blood, a truly tragic sight. In addition, there were various aviation charts inside the plane, including a "Flight Route Distance Chart of China and Japan, Jeju Island, Taiwan, and Dalian Three Air Bases," which listed various locations, from Tianjin and Beijing in the north to Hangzhou and Ganzhou in the south, all of which are important cities. Lushan was also prominently marked. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)

[Nanjing] At 1:01 PM on the 15th, the entire city heard the alarm. At 1:45 PM, enemy planes were spotted in the skies over Nanjing. Eight planes, divided into two groups, attacked, first dropping a bomb on Zhongzheng Road. Our four city defense forces fired anti-aircraft guns. They then flew to Ming Palace and dropped two bombs before fleeing south. Over a dozen of our planes took off in pursuit. The alarm was lifted at 3:30 PM. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)

### Tang Enbo Telegraphs Operational Progress of Our Troops at Nankou

Enemy repeatedly reinforced, fierce attacks repelled. More than 30 Japanese aircraft bombed, failed to achieve results. Positions around Nankou Huyucun area remain unusually solid.

[Nanjing] General Commander Tang Enbo telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the 14th, reporting on the victorious battles of our troops at Nankou. The original telegram is transcribed below: "To Nanjing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: Since the 11th, the Japanese bandits have launched fierce attacks on the positions around Nankou and Deshenkou, first with over 1,000 infantry, 600-700 cavalry, over 20 artillery pieces, and 9 aircraft. Our troops are in high morale, responding calmly to the all-day battle, with only a dozen or so casualties. The enemy suffered many casualties. At dawn on the 12th, the enemy reinforced with over 5,000 infantry, 60 artillery pieces, and over 30 tanks, fiercely attacking the Nankou, Huyucun, Xinzhongkou, and Sulin Kou areas, launching five or six attacks that were all repelled by us. We suffered over 500 casualties, while the enemy doubled, with corpses piled up and in a terrible state. Moreover, over 30 enemy aircraft bombed but failed to achieve results. In this battle, relying on the calm response of our defending troops under Luo's command and the exceptional bravery of the officers and soldiers, we inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. The fierce fighting continued on the morning of the 13th, and we captured six enemy tanks. However, although our positions were heavily suppressed by enemy artillery fire, the officers and soldiers were loyal and brave, vowing never to retreat. I also strictly ordered them to hold their positions, that they would rather die than seek to survive. On the 13th, the enemy increased their forces by about two divisions to attack, repeatedly charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, but they were still repelled by us. At present, the positions around Nankou and Huyucun remain unusually solid. My unit has repeatedly received encouragement from your telegram, and coupled with the officers and soldiers being instilled with the principles and inspired by your virtues, we now embrace the determination to be invincible against the enemy at this critical juncture of national survival. Therefore, although we have been subjected to intense attacks from enemy artillery and aircraft in recent days, the officers and soldiers have been brave and calm, advancing one after another. Thanks to the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in heaven and your esteemed grace, we have been able to turn danger into safety and repeatedly defeat the strong enemy. In the future, we will follow your instructions more closely, remain calm and hold firm, consolidate our positions, encourage the three armies, bravely resist the war, and not lose an inch of territory. Knowing you are concerned, I respectfully report this. Further reports will be submitted after the end of the battle. Your subordinate, Tang Enbo, Cold Son Can Seal."

(Urgent Telegram, 15th)

[Qingdao] Regarding the Japanese sailor incident, the Japanese side is pressuring Shen Honglie to acknowledge that it was done by Chinese people, but Shen is refusing to yield, and the situation is becoming serious. There is news that the Japanese navy will land troops. (Special Dispatch, 15th)

[Qingdao] At approximately 0:40 PM on the 14th, a Japanese sailor was shot in a secluded spot on Zhejiang Road, causing extreme tension in the city. All stores closed their doors. By the time our police arrived at the scene, the Japanese navy had already taken the injured soldiers to the Japanese Resident Corps via motorized tricycle. Witnesses reported to the police station that they saw two Japanese sailors with a Japanese woman heading north on Zhejiang Road, and three other Japanese sailors came up from behind and opened fire on the two, causing the two sailors and the Japanese woman to fall to the ground one after the other. The three sailors who opened fire then fled. Subsequently, some Japanese arrived by car and took the injured soldiers and the woman away. This situation was personally witnessed by an American pastor living in the building across the street, who plans to provide written testimony. Afterward, Chinese and Japanese military police guarded the scene, and some British and American sailors also went to investigate. The Japanese Resident Corps then held an emergency meeting to discuss everything. The Japanese Consul stationed in Qingdao, Ohtaka, made a special visit to the municipal government to meet with Shen Honglie. He agreed that both sides should first investigate this incident and expressed willingness to resolve it through diplomatic channels in the future. Also, when the incident occurred, a Chinese man passing by on a bicycle was stopped and severely beaten by the Japanese, and then taken to the Japanese Resident Corps. The fate of the three people is currently unclear. The Japanese destroyer Shirayuki arrived in Qingdao on the afternoon of the 14th. There are now a total of five Japanese warships stationed in Qingdao. Also, after the incident occurred, the sailors of the Japanese warships anchored in the back sea lined up and prepared to land, but this was stopped after our negotiations. Generally speaking, it is believed that this incident was a planned action by the Japanese side. (Special Dispatch, 14th)

[Qingdao] (Delayed) The Japanese warship Tenryu, which was originally scheduled to leave Qingdao at 2:00 PM on the 11th, was still docked at Pier No. 2 on the 14th. At around 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th, two Japanese were suddenly shot in front of the St. Ursula Girls' High School, one being killed and the other seriously injured. When the gunshots occurred, pedestrians on Zhongshan Road and other streets were immediately panicked, and the stores closed one after another. Our police immediately took precautions to prevent any accidents. According to eyewitnesses from our country, the Japanese were indeed shot by a Japanese sailor. The two Japanese who were shot were in plain clothes, but the Japanese immediately carried the wounded to the Japanese hospital without reporting to our police officers. However, the Japanese side claimed that they were shot by a plainclothes team on bicycles from our side. At the time of the incident, a cyclist was captured by Japanese sailors. The Tenryu warship's marine corps is armed and ready to deploy, and over 20 heavy trucks were requisitioned for use within five minutes of the incident, and ammunition was being unloaded, causing a serious situation. Also, the Japanese Consul Ohtaka visited Mayor Shen at the municipal government at around 3:00 PM, still claiming that it was done by our plainclothes team. Shen rejected it and demanded that military actions be stopped immediately. Ohtaka did not oppose it, and both sides sent personnel to investigate the truth. Both sides are currently on high alert. Furthermore, according to various inquiries by reporters, the two Japanese victims were shot by Japanese sailors for refusing to be drafted to Shanghai to fight. Moreover, when the incident occurred, our citizens passing by saw Japanese sailors firing, but the Japanese side falsely accused our plainclothes team, which is clearly a premeditated plan with other intentions. (Central News Agency Telegram, 14th)

[Qingdao] (Delayed) Negotiations regarding the shooting of Japanese sailors Hattori and Tsujimoto reached a temporary conclusion at 10:00 PM. Both sides agreed to continue negotiations at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 15th. This place is still calm, and the rear is heavily guarded. (Central News Agency Telegram, 14th)

[Qingdao] Negotiations regarding the shooting of Japanese sailors here are still underway at 8:00 PM. According to the Japanese side, the two sailors who were shot, one named Hattori, is already dead, and the other, Tsujimoto, is in critical condition. Our authorities expressed three points to the Japanese side: 1. Both sides should jointly dissect the body of the deceased. 2. The arrested Chinese citizens should be released first. 3. Japanese warships should cease all military actions. However, the Japanese side insisted that our authorities admit that the shooting was done by Chinese people. Mayor Shen stated that the truth of this incident is still unclear. The Japanese side has no concrete evidence and cannot forcibly claim that it was done by Chinese people. Before the truth is known, if the Japanese side takes any military actions, the responsibility should be fully borne by the Japanese side. Judging from the current situation, negotiations are unlikely to be effective. The Japanese warship Tatsuta in the front sea moved to the back sea at 7:00 PM, preparing for an armed landing. We are also actively preparing for defense. There are currently five Japanese warships stationed here. (Central News Agency Telegram, 14th)

### Naval Authorities of Various Countries Notify Japanese Warships to Leave the Concession

To Avoid Bombing Hazards in the Concession, the Izumo Warship Must Be Immediately Relocated

Due to the air combat between the enemy and our forces that occurred the day before, and the opening of anti-aircraft guns, the naval authorities of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy stationed in Shanghai all believe that the Japanese flagship Izumo is actually the fuse. Considering that it occupies the docks within the concession area as a military base, thereby causing the concession area to also fall into a war zone, to avoid this danger and to protect the lives and property of foreign nationals within the concession, it is necessary to notify the warship to immediately leave the concession. Therefore, yesterday, the naval authorities of various countries jointly notified the warship, ordering it to leave the Huangpu River to maintain the peace of the concession. Unexpectedly, after receiving the notification, the enemy warship used the protection of Japanese nationals as an excuse to refuse to accept the notification. It is reported that the naval authorities of various countries are currently meeting to discuss taking further effective measures. (Shen Shi News Agency) The "Zi Lin News" reports that yesterday (the 14th), Chinese aircraft flew out to attack, their target clearly being the Japanese flagship Izumo. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is currently doing its utmost to request the Japanese authorities to relocate the warship away from the vicinity of the Japanese Consulate General.

Current Commentary

### Two Unfortunate Events in the Air Battle

— Xiang

The Sino-Japanese air battle the day before yesterday was caused by weather conditions and resulted in two unfortunate events. 1. During the battle, a bomb fell in front of the Great World in the French Concession, killing and wounding five to six hundred people. 2. A bomb also fell on the Bund of Nanjing Road, between the Hui Zhong Hotel and the Sassoon Building, killing and wounding fifty to sixty people. The occurrence of these two tragedies is very regrettable. However, in such a tremendous typhoon, it is not easy to accurately aim when dropping bombs. Therefore, under these special circumstances, this cruel result was likely to occur.

War is dangerous, and these kinds of unfortunate events could potentially occur at any time and any place. However, the responsibility for these tragedies should be entirely borne by the Japanese side.

1. Japan has already invaded our North China with a large army and further invades our Zhabei with a large navy. They have repeatedly declared verbally that the situation will not escalate or that it can be resolved locally, but in reality, they continue to transport troops and equipment, pressing closer and closer until they achieve their so-called "Continental Policy." No country can tolerate such ambition and insatiable aggression. There is no other way to compel them to self-reflect except to inflict the most severe blow. On the path of saving the nation and preserving our existence, there is no other way for our country to make them change their minds except to risk the lives of the entire nation in a decisive life-or-death battle with the enemy. Therefore, our country's decision to resist the enemy this time was made after repeated deliberation and careful consideration. There is no room for retreat.

2. Japan naturally gains considerable military advantages by using the concession as a base for military operations. We learned a great lesson from the January 28th Incident. Our country, fearing to harm the innocent, often has many constraints in its military strategy, resulting in considerable disappointment. Now, Japan is again following its previous tactics. Warships are concentrated in the Huangpu River, and troops are stationed in the Zhabei and Hongkou areas, using the concession as a shield and resisting stubbornly. This creates many constraints for our country militarily. Although we express our deepest regret for the occurrence of these unfortunate events, they are truly unavoidable.

Therefore, the only solution now is to request the relevant countries to inform the Japanese military authorities that if they wish to wage war, they should immediately withdraw all Japanese troops and warships from outside the Public Concession and not occupy the concession to wage war against us. Therefore, yesterday, Mayor Yu sent a note to the consular body, stating that "the military authorities of our country hope and request that the relevant parties in various countries immediately stop Japan from using the concession as a military base to attack our country's troops. Otherwise, our country cannot be responsible for any unfortunate consequences that may arise." The facts are clear. There should be no concealment. We ask that the relevant countries pay close attention to these events or excuse them.

### The United States Urges China and Japan Not to Endanger the Safety of Foreign Nationals in Shanghai

Roosevelt Will Issue an Important Declaration; Senator Borah Advocates Non-Intervention

[Washington] Following the outbreak of air combat between Chinese and Japanese forces in Shanghai, which has affected the concession, Secretary of State Hull issued a statement to the press, stating, "The government has instructed its ambassador to China and consuls in various locations to strongly advise American nationals to accept government protection so that they may be evacuated from dangerous areas." He added that there are a total of 3,000 American nationals in the Shanghai area, and there are sufficient warships of our country stationed in Chinese waters for the purpose of evacuation. At the same time, the government has lodged representations with the governments of China and Japan, requesting that they not subject the approximately 100,000 foreign nationals in the Shanghai area to danger. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

[Washington] According to Secretary of State Hull's announcement, the United States, following Britain, has requested that both China and Japan not use Shanghai as a base for offensive operations. The current U.S. Ambassador Johnson has gone to Shanghai to find ways to assist American nationals. Furthermore, the U.S. Asiatic Fleet is adequately prepared to evacuate 3,000 American nationals in a very short period after receiving instructions. The State Department is working day and night with the Navy to coordinate and dispatch warships to Shanghai in a timely manner to prepare for any eventuality. Hull also stated that U.S. diplomatic authorities and the Navy Department are constantly consulting with representatives of other governments on ways to protect foreign nationals in Shanghai. Hull expressed his deep regret for the deaths and injuries of American nationals and stated that U.S. diplomatic personnel in the war zone have received instructions to close public offices and relocate to other places if necessary. Furthermore, regarding the dispatch of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet flagship "Augusta" to Shanghai, the Navy Department stated that the ship has been ordered to act at its discretion in the local area. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that if the situation in Shanghai continues to change, President Roosevelt plans to issue an important declaration on Sino-Japanese relations on Monday or Tuesday. Senator Borah, on the other hand, advocates non-intervention, stating, "The world seems to have decided to adopt war, military equipment, and tax increases to achieve the goal of suicide. Therefore, I believe that the United States should remain outside of the Chinese Incident to maintain our civilization in the long run." (Central News Agency, 15th, Havas)

### French Press Sympathetic to Our Country

[Paris] Various newspapers here are commenting on the Shanghai war. The Communist "Humanité" reports that "Japanese imperialism is attacking China and attempting to seize the provinces of North China and the city of Shanghai. The Chinese nation, in order to defend its territory, safeguard its existence, and maintain its long-standing culture, so that it will not be trampled upon by barbarous fascism, has now risen up in unison and is determined to resist. All progressive elements around the world are expressing their sympathy, just as they sympathize with the Spanish nation. All peace-loving democrats know that a policy of neutrality is in fact a destruction of collective peace, which is an organization intended to assist invaded countries in a mutually supportive manner." The Radical Socialist Republican newspaper reports that "Shanghai is one of the wealthiest cities in the world, which Japan has long coveted. It is to be expected that China will resist to the death. Judging by the intensity of the fighting, Japan's hope of victory is still slim. However, the Japanese are stubborn in nature, and it is not impossible that some agreement will be reached through diplomatic means in the future. However, it is possible to assert that the war will be protracted." The leftist daily newspaper reports that "The outbreak of the Shanghai war at a time when Japan is waging war on the border of Inner Mongolia is by no means accidental. The grand plan set by the Japanese government is to establish an autonomous system in the provinces north of the Yellow River. China is willing to fight in Shanghai to contain it. As for Japan, the government waited quietly for six days after the Hongqiao Incident without making any decisions because it did not want to fight with a small number of troops, as it did in 1932. Therefore, there is no doubt that the war will not end easily." (Central News Agency, 15th, Havas)

### British and American Cooperation is Needed to Stop Japanese Atrocities

If China Can Sustain its Resistance, Japan Will Eventually Collapse

—Observations from the London Times—

[London] The attitudes of Britain and the United States regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute have recently been commented on by the London Times, which stated, "Regarding Britain, the Cabinet decided last month to adopt a neutral policy. The general view here is that unless it can act jointly with the United States, Britain will find it difficult to take a firm stance to suppress Japan. This is because if British troops are transferred from Europe to the Far East, the situation in Europe will immediately deteriorate. Most of the slight improvement in the European situation over the past twelve months has been due to Britain's military expansion, which is generally recognized." Regarding the United States, President Roosevelt may even take the opportunity to postpone the implementation of the Neutrality Act after Congress adjourns, so that he can supply China with arms. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

[London] The "Sunday Times" published an editorial today, stating that Japan's dispatch of warships and aircraft carriers, and the clamor in Tokyo newspapers about the Shanghai war, seem to be more than just retaliation. The conflict between the two sides has not yet reached the stage of a major war. This time, Japan's use of force is extremely misguided. Japan needs peace now, and its politicians all know this. Japan's most pressing question at present is clearly economic. Every step deeper into China increases the burden on its taxpayers and reduces their ability to pay taxes. The Japanese are patriotic, but the demands of their army will inevitably push their patriotism to the breaking point. China needs peace even more than Japan. Britain's position on the development of this disaster is relatively simple, namely, to care about China's peace and commerce. Britain needs the cooperation of the United States. Close cooperation between Britain and the United States is essential for the overall situation. It is hoped that this can be achieved soon. (Central News Agency, 15th, Reuters)

[London] Regarding the dispute between China and Japan, the "Sunday Times" recently stated that the Chinese government will file a complaint with the League of Nations in the near future, but it is not yet known whether it will wait for the League of Nations Council to hold its regular meeting next month or request that the Council convene a temporary meeting. "What China hopes is not to launch a collective security mechanism to deal with Japan, but to appeal to public opinion about Japan's renewed aggression against China." The newspaper also stated that Japan faces numerous difficulties in this dispute. China can sustain its resistance to Japan for a year. If that happens, the Japanese government's plan will be overturned. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

### American Newspapers Publish News of the Shanghai War with Large Headlines

[New York] The local newspapers are all publishing the news of the Shanghai bombing with banner headlines. The "New York Sun" has a banner headline: "Chinese Planes Bomb Japanese Warships, Bombs Fall in Crowded City Center." The "New York Post" carries the headline: "Chinese Planes Bomb Shanghai, Three Americans Killed." (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)

### German Political Circles Hope for an Early Resolution of the Dispute

### General Zhang Zhizhong's Heroic Speech at the Front Line

The Officers and Soldiers of This Army Vow to Not Coexist with the Enemy; We Will Achieve Final Victory with the Determination to Sacrifice

Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Garrison in the Nanjing and Shanghai area, at the request of reporters at 4:00 PM on the 14th, amidst pressing military affairs, calmly and resolutely delivered a speech as follows: This time, the Japanese imperialists provoked in Shanghai, using the so-called Hongqiao Airport Incident as an excuse to make unreasonable demands on us, intending to pressure our security forces to withdraw and dismantle defensive works. Our side, in order to defend our territory and fight for national survival, cannot accept these unreasonable demands. It has been repeatedly witnessed that Japanese soldiers in Shanghai have repeatedly violated our Hongqiao Airport, and their marines have crossed the boundary to set up posts. The intention behind this is self-evident. In the past, the security forces guarding the airport have always taken a tolerant attitude, enduring all kinds of insults. As a result, on the 9th of this month, a naval officer led soldiers to drive cars into and open fire on our guards. A security force soldier, Shi Jingzan, was shot and killed on the spot. Our side, having reached the end of our tolerance, had no choice but to return fire. The truth about the so-called Hongqiao Incident is roughly as follows. After the incident occurred, while the matter was under investigation by both sides, the Japanese side also used diplomatic means as a smokescreen to deceive the world. On the other hand, they shipped a large number of marines from within the country and mobilized regular troops, sending 34 warships and aircraft carriers to Shanghai, intending to exert pressure on us and force us to submit in humiliation. The Japanese side claimed that they came to protect 15,000 overseas Chinese, but in fact, overseas Chinese of the enemy side in Shanghai have never been threatened by our side. Even at the height of the tense Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, our local government provided meticulous protection to the Japanese overseas Chinese. Diplomatic personnel from various countries in Shanghai and overseas Chinese from various countries have witnessed this, which shows that the so-called pretext of protecting overseas Chinese is completely groundless. With a large army of the Japanese side gathering, there is no doubt that they are determined to attack our army, attempting to create a second January 28th Incident. The lives and property of our two million compatriots living in Shanghai are at risk of being destroyed by the violent Japanese artillery fire at any time. We only have a small number of security forces to bear the responsibility of protection. How can we rashly withdraw, leaving our compatriots to be slaughtered by the violent Japanese, and abandon our important responsibility of maintaining local security? Therefore, our rejection of the Japanese side's demands is extremely solemn. Moreover, while diplomatic negotiations were still underway, at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the previous day (the 13th), Japanese warships suddenly used heavy artillery to bombard our Zhabei area, and the sound of artillery continued throughout the night, causing heavy losses to our people. At the same time, infantry troops also rushed out of the boundary to attack our security force positions. Our side still responded with a calm attitude and never returned a single shot. Now, the Japanese side is launching a large-scale offensive with land, sea, and air forces. In order to defend our territory and safeguard our sovereignty, we can no longer tolerate it. As of today, peace has indeed been completely severed, and sacrifice has reached the final moment. Defending against insults and saving the nation is a righteous cause with no turning back. It should be solemnly declared that the peace of Shanghai has been shattered by the Japanese military bombardment, and the territory created by our ancestors with painstaking effort has once again been trampled by the enemy's iron hooves. We have no choice but to launch a sacred and solemn war of resistance with the determination of heroic self-defense. All the officers and soldiers under the command of this army vow to not coexist with the violent Japanese. For the past five years, we have been reminding the army day and night to make it our responsibility to avenge national humiliation and recover lost territory. The blood and flesh of our 100,000 soldiers will be the Great Wall to defend our territory. We will use the spirit of shedding blood on the Shanghai Great Wall to sweep the enemy troops out of our borders. We will not stop until we achieve the goal of protecting our complete territorial rights. Our compatriots throughout the country, especially the patriotic compatriots in the Nanjing and Shanghai area, should know that this war is actually the final juncture of the survival of the entire nation, the last reckoning of decades of humiliation and endurance. We are fighting for the oppressed to seek liberation, for the preservation of our national character, and for our 7,000-year-old divine Huaxia lineage to live, eat, sing, weep, and gather our nation here. We are fighting for the billions of years to raise our children and grandchildren here. We must be loyal, brave, and vigorous, yet calm and firm, persevering, and ready to shed blood, not hesitating to sacrifice, to shatter the enemy's dream of aggression. We will follow the instructions of our supreme commander, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and with the determination to sacrifice to the end, we will surely achieve final victory. It can be asserted that Shanghai, as a place where foreigners gather, is being wantonly provoked by the Japanese military today, which not only destroys the integrity of our territory but also harms the interests and safety of foreign nationals in Shanghai. All enlightened friendly people will surely extend their infinite sympathy to us, and this army will naturally do its best to protect them.

### Yang Hu Concurrently Serves as Shanghai Garrison Commander

Yang Hu, the Commander of the Songhu Police Force, was ordered on the previous day (the 14th) to concurrently serve as the Shanghai Garrison Commander. In addition to taking office locally on the same day in accordance with the order, he also issued a notice to inform the citizens to strictly prohibit violence and adultery and to maintain local security. It is reported that Commander Yang visits the front line from time to time and is unusually invigorated. The Shanghai Garrison Command's notice is recorded below: "It has been received that Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed the following: 'It is hereby ordered that the said officer be appointed as the Shanghai Garrison Commander. In addition to reporting and issuing separate orders, it is hereby ordered that the aforementioned be complied with, that he assume office and report accordingly. ' Upon receipt of this, I will comply and take office immediately. As we are in the midst of national crisis, prohibiting violence and adultery, and maintaining local security are our unavoidable responsibilities. We will certainly carry out the Martial Law Act in accordance with the law. In addition to reporting and issuing separate orders, a public notice is hereby issued for general information. This notice is issued on August 15th of the 26th year of the Republic of China. Garrison Commander Yang Hu."

### Strict Defenses Set Up Along the Suzhou Creek

Machine Guns Placed at Important Intersections; Barbed Wire Around the Creek

In order to increase the defensive strength of the northern district, the Shanghai Municipal Council added Western merchant corps yesterday morning, and negotiated with the British and American naval commanders stationed in Shanghai to dispatch elite naval personnel to various iron gate sides and blockhouses to conduct strict defense. All

Important locations such as the intersection of North Henan Road and Baoshan Road, the boundary road, the intersection of North Shanxi Road, the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Huaxingfang, and adjacent intersections, the intersection of Haining Road, the bridge on North Xizang Road, and the intersection of Mongolia Road were each increased to more than ten people yesterday, and weapons such as machine guns were deployed. Horizontal or circular sandbags were stacked in each of these locations. In addition, engineering personnel were dispatched to bring laborers to build wooden stakes about three feet long from the bridge on North Xizang Road along the Chinese area, passing through Mongolia Road, Alabastar Road, Xinjiang Road, and East Haining Road to the north, following North Zhejiang Road to the intersection of the boundary road.

Wire mesh is wound. Those who still reside within this kind of wire mesh and have not yet relocated are immediately ordered to move away. Therefore, even in strong winds and rain, the work is still extremely tense. In addition, the bridges on the Suzhou Creek from east to west were uniformly fitted with wooden frames wrapped in barbed wire yesterday. Only one gap was left on each bridge surface for people to come and go. It is heard that if the war extends to the northern district of the concession, the authorities will block the gaps in each bridge with the obstacles placed, cutting off north-south traffic.

### Defense of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Consolidated

Air Defenses Well Arranged in Various Places; Railway and Highway Defenses Especially Tight

A reporter from the Guomin News Agency has been inspecting the counties near Shanghai for several days, passing through Suzhou, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Kunshan, Wujiang, Changshu, and other counties. After interviewing the local garrison commanders, it was learned that the defenses of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are extremely solid and sufficient to destroy the enemy's forces. Special attention has been paid to air defense. In addition to the military authorities deploying active air defenses, they are also urging the people to prepare passive air defenses, which have all been properly arranged. The reporter also inspected the Jinghu, Huhangyong railways, the Sujia Railway, and the Xihu, Jiasu highways and saw that the road protection works had been completed long ago, and the bridges and other places were especially well guarded. The local people are working extremely hard for the anti-Japanese war, such as establishing rescue teams and publicizing air defense, which are all being carried out effectively and have achieved considerable results.

### Municipal Council Issues Passes

### Comforting the Frontline Soldiers of the New Life Movement, and Appealing to the Public to Calmly Face the Difficulties

To Calm the Public in Facing Difficulties

The Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association, in light of the brutal Japanese invasion of Shanghai and the commencement of hostilities, deeply admires our loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines who are fighting valiantly. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to Lieutenant General Zhang Zhizhong, the Garrison Commander of Nanjing and Shanghai, to convey their comfort to the frontline soldiers. At the same time, they issued a public appeal, urging people to economize on food and clothing, contribute their manpower and financial resources to the best of their ability, and calmly face the difficulties. The details are recorded below:

Comforting the Soldiers

To Commander Wen and all the soldiers fighting the enemy: The powerful enemy is invading, and we can no longer endure it. Since the Hongqiao Incident, enemy warships have gathered, deliberately escalating the situation. On the morning of the 13th, enemy troops suddenly rushed into the defensive lines of our city and attacked our defending soldiers. Their provocation is evident to all, both Chinese and foreigners. Fortunately, our troops resisted calmly and drove the enemy back. After 3 p.m., battles broke out successively in various parts of Zhabei. Our soldiers fought bravely, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The people in the rear share a common hatred and are willing to sacrifice everything to support our brave soldiers fighting on the front lines. With righteous cause, our army will be strong, and a grieving army will surely win. The annihilation of the vile enemy is as certain as if it were foretold. We hereby express our comfort and await news of victory.

Public Appeal

The powerful enemy is pressing in, gaining an inch and wanting a mile, devastating Tianjin and triggering conflict in Shanghai. At this critical moment when the nation is on the brink of collapse and the survival of the nation is at stake, our frontline soldiers are all loyal, brave, and fighting desperately against the powerful enemy. We, the people in the rear, should not hesitate to sacrifice and provide support to the soldiers fighting the enemy. The following six points are particularly important, and we hereby appeal to all citizens: ㊀ Face the difficulties calmly and do not panic. ㊁ Economize on food and clothing, and use old things for as long as possible. ㊂ Contribute your manpower and financial resources to actively participate in the war effort. ㊃ Please have all entertainment venues in the city cease operations immediately and use the entire premises to accommodate refugees. ㊄ Please urge citizens to actively report traitors. Anyone who provides food to the enemy, assists the enemy with labor, or deposits money abroad, and those preparing to organize local maintenance associations, are all traitors. ㊅ Please have citizens donate all scrap copper and iron to the government.

### Anti-Enemy Association Teaches Wartime Knowledge

The number of applicants has been very enthusiastic. The first session is already full. Originally, it was scheduled to be taught in two classes, from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. and from 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., respectively. Now it has been decided to change the teaching time to 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. every day. The courses are divided into International Knowledge, Military Equipment Knowledge, Poisoning Prevention Knowledge, First Aid Knowledge, and Air Defense Knowledge, etc. The location is still set at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road, Beijing Road, and experts have been hired as lecturers. It is said that the second session is now continuing to register.

### The Atrocities of the Japanese Army are Hair-Raising

The Innocent Villagers Were Brutally Murdered; Planned Bombing of Shanghai University

A Miserable Death of a Village Woman

Around 7 o'clock last night, according to those who had just escaped from the Yangshupu area, around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, they passed through Huasheng Road, Pingliang Road, and Taopeng Road, and passed the Wayside Wharf, and then entered the safe area via Broadway Road and across the Garden Bridge. Because they were exploring the way along the way, it took four hours. They did not see any Japanese troops along the way. It seemed that they were lurking inside the houses. The gate of the Oushan Wharf was tightly closed, with two Japanese soldiers standing in front of the gate. When passing the Nanyang Company, there was nothing unusual either. The only thing heard along the way was the frequent sound of artillery fire from the northeast. However, when passing Hongqiao outside the China Merchants Bureau's middle warehouse, they witnessed three corpses. One was an elderly man with graying hair, one was a child of ten, and the other was a young woman, all dressed as local villagers. It seemed that they were a family trying to escape the dangerous area from there. The old man and the child were stabbed with bayonets more than ten times all over their bodies. The lower garment of the woman's corpse was stripped off, and she was lying prone on the east end of the bridge. In addition to three or four bayonet wounds on the upper body, the center of the buttocks was also cut open with a bayonet. The death was extremely tragic. The Japanese army's cruel methods of harming innocent people are unmatched even by barbarian peoples.

Shanghai University in Danger

With the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the schools and important cultural institutions in the Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Yangshupu areas are now under the threat of enemy aircraft, and there is a danger of being bombed at any time. According to those who escaped from the Yangshupu and Jungong Road areas yesterday, the Japanese army is already planning to bomb the Shanghai University campus on Jungong Road. The Japanese army falsely claimed that Chinese soldiers were hiding in the Shanghai University campus and attacking the Japanese army with weapons. Therefore, the Japanese army will strike at it when necessary. Currently, most of the students and faculty who remain at Shanghai University have left the school three days ago and are temporarily living in the concession. Only a small number of school servants are left in the school. President Liu Zhan'en also stayed in Shanghai to engage in refugee relief work.

### The Situation is Serious for Several Days; Traffic Inside and Outside the City is Obstructed

The Number of Passengers Leaving Shanghai Has Decreased; The Border Between the Chinese and French Areas Declares Martial Law

The Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Operates as Usual

The Shanghai-Hangzhou train traffic operated as usual yesterday. There were three passenger trains to Hangzhou, and passengers were no longer crowded. Each passenger train from Hangzhou was attached with three to four freight cars loaded with food, firewood, charcoal, fresh vegetables, etc., to supply the needs of the people in Shanghai.

Traffic in the Chinese and French Areas is Obstructed

All areas in the southern part of Shanghai are as peaceful as usual, guarded by our police protection corps. Martial law is declared from 10 p.m. to 9 a.m., and traffic is cut off. All public vehicles are suspended. The trams and buses in the French Concession were still running the day before yesterday, but they were also suspended yesterday.

Inland River Ships Stop Running

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, water and land transportation has been suspended. The day before yesterday, passengers going to Shanghai and Hangzhou changed to inland river boats one after another, resulting in unprecedented crowding on various inland river routes. However, according to a report from the Datong News Agency yesterday morning, the five shipping companies of Yuantong, Liyu, Zhengchang, Yuchang, and Lixing on North Suzhou Road have all suspended inland river routes starting yesterday. As for the Shenhu route, Tianxing was requested by the Lake Society Committee to arrange for the company to tow two barges and carry about 500 passengers out of the North Suzhou River at 9 a.m. the day before yesterday. However, there were still many passengers who could not get on board.

### The Japanese Consulate Moves to a Warship to Conduct Business

After our air force bombed the enemy warship Izumo the day before yesterday, the Japanese Consulate on the Huangpu River, fearing that our air force would drop bombs again, moved important documents out of the consulate that night and set up offices on the warship.

### The Unfortunate Victims in Front of the HSBC Hotel

If the Wronged Souls are Conscious, They Will Curse the Japanese

The Continental Daily reported that yesterday afternoon (the 14th), during the air battle between Chinese and Japanese aircraft, two bombs fell into the Huangpu River, and the splashing river water swept onto the shore. Two more fell at the corner of Nanjing Road, HSBC Hotel, and Cathay Hotel. The time was 4:27, as the clock of the Cathay Hotel was stopped by the shock. A total of 145 people died, including guests and pedestrians on the road, and 70 were injured. One of the bombs that fell on the HSBC Hotel penetrated through the roof to the bottom floor. Among the foreigners who died were Mr. William, an accountant of the North-China Daily News, and a certain Russian. Among the injured was Dr. Lyschal, an American professor of international relations at Pomona College, who lost one leg, and Dr. Shafei, a German doctor, etc. Also, it is now known that among the foreigners who died in the bombs that fell in front of the Great World were Mr. and Mrs. Hao Nisibao of the West Coast Life Insurance Company, the American missionary Zhilinsen, the English doctor Robert, and the music teacher of the Public Concession, the Russian Aislin. Among the injured were also several foreigners, including two Frenchmen from the French Electricity Company, who have been sent to Guangci Hospital. Due to the severity of their injuries, there is fear of death.

According to eyewitnesses at the Bund Park at the time, when the HSBC Hotel was hit, the Chinese on the sidewalk and in the center of the road were unable to escape, and the number of deaths and injuries reached sixty to seventy. They were immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulances. The creation of this unfortunate incident may be due to the concession giving the Japanese the convenience of using it as a base for military operations. There is nothing but regret for the Chinese and Western people who died tragically.

### Rice Shops That Are Heartless and Treacherous for Aiding the Enemy Deserve to Be Killed

Transporting Rice to Aid the Enemy; Warrants for the Main Criminals; Raising Rice Prices; Fined 2,000 Shi

Wanxingshun at No. 1271 Haig Road, Xujiahui, and Shilianghao at No. 2006 Yangjiaku, are solely owned by Li Amei, a local. The business is very good. In the past ten days, the store has often used trucks to transport large quantities of white rice at night and sell them to aid the enemy. The retail purchase of rice was stopped, causing panic among nearby residents. Yesterday afternoon at about 1 p.m., another truck was loading dozens of shi of white rice at Wanxingshun, covered with boxes.

To Avoid Attention

The household registration director of the police station, Zhu Zhaoye, discovered the contents. The masses immediately clamored, and an apprentice was arrested and sent to the police station. It was found that the Meilin Company at No. 808 Hongqiao was selling it on behalf. The police were dispatched to arrest Chen Run, the manager of the company, and a chef. At the same time, the police were ordered to strictly arrest the fleeing principals and Qin, the manager of Daxing, and bring them to justice. The police station also found that Yongxiang Rice Shop at No. 2078 Haig Road had raised rice prices and disrupted the food supply, etc. The shop was detained and fined 2,000 shi of rice to be confiscated as a warning. Also, Xie Da Rice Shop at No. 102 Yuan'erdi Road

After the outbreak of the war, the words "Serving the Public, Tongju Lun" were written in red letters, and rice was sold for only one yuan. However, at about 2 p.m. yesterday, two private cars suddenly drove to the door of the rice shop, one with the concession registration number 11505 and the other with 8501. Twelve bags of rice were transported out of the shop, with six bags loaded on each car. Nearby residents said that the shop had stipulated that no wholesale food would be sold, but suddenly a large number of rice was loaded out. The residents rushed to the shop to peep and discovered that

There Were Japanese People in the Cars

Two Japanese people were escorting them, and the crowd was outraged, believing that the shop was selling grain to aid the enemy. They immediately attacked the car and opened the engine, setting it on fire. Two Japanese people then used knives to attack, and one person was seriously injured by the stabbing, but they managed to escape. One of the drivers who drove for the Japanese was also escaped. Another driver was beaten by the crowd and escaped to Xiahui Lane, Xiahui Road. The crowd chased after him and was taken to the police station by the police. The burning car was also extinguished by the fire truck called by the police station. As for the shop owner and witnesses, they were taken to the police station for questioning.

From 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM, more than 60,000 people, mostly the elderly, weak, women, and children, were rescued.

Privy Seal Transferred to Foreign Affairs; To Win Over Italy and Germany

[London] The "People's Daily" recently reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain is preparing to reorganize the entire British cabinet in order to make the reorganized cabinet more national in nature and to place the power of diplomatic supervision in the hands of the Prime Minister. As for the reorganization method, it is roughly planned to invite extreme conservative party leader Churchill and opposition liberal party leader Lloyd George to serve as ministers without portfolio. Foreign Secretary Eden will be transferred to Colonial Secretary, and the current Lord Privy Seal Halifax will be transferred to Foreign Secretary, because Halifax is quite favored by German leader Hitler.
