### He Yingqin Discusses Principles of Sichuan-Xikang Military Reorganization Plan

Military Headquarters Has Telegraphed Liu Xiang; When He Will Go to Sichuan Is Still Undecided; He Beihang Arrived in Lushan Yesterday

[Nanjing] Central News Agency reporter recently heard that the Central Government has formally telegraphed the Sichuan-Xikang Military Reorganization Plan to Sichuan-Xikang Pacification Director Liu Xiang. Uncertain whether it was true, the reporter went to the Ministry of Military Affairs on the 23rd to visit Minister He Yingqin and asked about the truth. He replied, saying that the military reorganization plan had been carefully revised and formally telegraphed to Director Liu on the 22nd by the Ministry of Military Affairs. The principles are as follows: (1) The Sichuan-Xikang troops will be directly under the Central Government by units of army (or independent division/brigade) and will be directly commanded by the Military Affairs Commission. However, for the necessary purposes of pacification, the Sichuan-Xikang Pacification Director may, with the approval of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, assign troops under his command. (2) The reorganization of the Sichuan-Xikang troops will be in accordance with the principles of military reorganization, and the main points are as follows: A. The number of troops will be reorganized and streamlined within the scope of the original military expenditure, and efforts will be made to gradually enrich their quality. B. The organization of each division will be based on the organization promulgated in 1937. C. Before the reorganization, all units must suspend the replenishment of troops. (3) The management of the troops will be based on the principle of centralized management by the Central Government, and the methods are as follows: A. Remuneration: The goal is to be able to issue rewards in accordance with the National Crisis Remuneration Regulations within the existing funds. B. The management agencies will be temporarily managed by the General Headquarters Accounting Office, and a Military Supplies Bureau will be established later to统筹辦理統筹辦理. C. The funds for each army will be directly issued by the General Headquarters. D. The clothing expenses for each army should be drawn from the original funds and transferred to the Central Government for unified production and distribution. (4) Personnel matters will be handled in accordance with the Army Personnel Regulations and will be directly under the Military Affairs Commission. (5) Military education will be under the jurisdiction of the Training Inspectorate. The original military officer and soldier education institutions should be taken over by the Central Government. (6) All military and political training will be handled by the General Headquarters Political Training Office. (7) Aviation and air defense matters will be handled by the Central Government in a unified manner. All aircraft squadrons, airfields, and factories will be taken over by the Central Government. When necessary for pacification missions, the Sichuan-Xikang Pacification Director may request the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission to allocate aviation squadrons stationed in Sichuan-Xikang under his command. (8) Military industrial and weapons manufacturing industries will be统筹辦理 by the Central Government. All manufacturing and repair plants will be taken over by the Central Government. (9) Military health matters will be uniformly guided by the Medical Affairs Department. (10) In order to reduce the burden on the people, the existing security and defense teams in Sichuan-Xikang should be reduced as much as possible. Local security can be maintained with the assistance of the national army. (11) The organization and funding of the Sichuan-Xikang Pacification Headquarters and its affiliated agencies will be re-examined to ensure that they are practical and that the savings can be used to supplement the weapons, ammunition, equipment, materials, and construction of barracks and training grounds for the Sichuan-Xikang troops. When Minister He reached this point, the reporter asked again, "I heard that the Central Government has decided to send a minister to Sichuan to preside over military reorganization matters. When will his honor be able to depart for Sichuan?" Minister He replied, "My duties in the Ministry of Military Affairs are very heavy, and it is really difficult to spare the time to go to Sichuan. If Chairman Chiang Kai-shek decides to send me to Sichuan to assist the Sichuan-Xikang generals in handling military reorganization matters, then the time in Sichuan will only be delayed by three to five days, at most a week. The time limit for the reorganization of Sichuan-Xikang troops is stipulated as one month to complete. There is no need for me to stay for a long time. As for when I will depart, it is still undecided." At this point, the reporter immediately took his leave. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)

[Jiujiang] Guling Telephone Report: Liu Xiang's representative He Beihang came to Lushan on a mission to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He arrived on the mountain on the morning of the 23rd via Hankou. According to reports, he is representing Chairman Liu to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report and seek instructions on everything. He will then go to Nanjing to visit Minister He to urge his dispatch to Sichuan to implement the Sichuan-Xikang military reorganization plan. Since the military reorganization plan was drafted, Chairman Liu and the Sichuan generals have repeatedly expressed their complete acceptance, because the significance of military reorganization lies in unifying the organization, improving the quality, and saving military expenses. Under this principle, there should be no dissenters. Therefore, the expressions of Chairman Liu and the Sichuan generals are from the bottom of their hearts. However, because the plan has been decided but the date of implementation has not been confirmed, Chairman Liu specially sent me to Lushan to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to request that a senior official be dispatched to Sichuan as soon as possible to preside over the reorganization of the Sichuan-Xikang troops so that the reorganization can be implemented as soon as possible. As for the implementation process, there are still many details that need to be discussed. Since the principles have been decided, the details should not be a problem, and everything should proceed smoothly. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)

### Executive Yuan Formulates Guidelines for Streamlining Central and Local Administration

And Principles for Reviewing Construction Projects

[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan's Administrative Efficiency Promotion Committee and the Construction Project Review Committee have been established. In order to promote their work, special guidelines for streamlining central and local administration and principles for reviewing construction projects have been formulated and circulated for implementation. The three guidelines are as follows:

▲Guidelines for Streamlining Central Administration

(1) The budgets of various agencies should be classified and compared based on the nature of the matters under their jurisdiction and the amount of work, and should be adjusted or revised appropriately with reference to their administrative plans, so that the various duties and undertakings of the state can be developed in a balanced and reasonable manner according to their needs and the complexity of the work. (2) The expenditure budgets of each agency should be classified and compared according to the matters under their jurisdiction, and the distribution of funds should be reviewed for any undue emphasis or underemphasis according to the nature and complexity of the various tasks, so that the various tasks undertaken by the agency can be developed in a reasonable manner. (3) Each agency should make every effort to save unnecessary consumption, and the savings should be used to increase construction efforts. A fixed percentage limit should be set for the proportion of officials' salaries in the total expenditure of each type of agency, so that it is not exceeded, and the funds for undertakings can be increased. (4) For agencies with independent accounting systems, such as railways, postal services, and aviation, attention should be paid to the economy and rationality of all income and expenditure figures and allocation methods. (5) All agencies should strictly implement the budget and final accounts system. (6) The relationship and distribution of powers between agencies should be properly adjusted to improve administrative efficiency. (7) The appointment, reward, and punishment of personnel in all agencies should be carried out in strict accordance with laws and regulations, and attention should be paid to matching people with positions to give full play to each person's strengths. The matters they handle should be carefully examined. (8) Administrative supervisors should be trained in stages, with special emphasis on spiritual education and the basic skills of local administration and local construction, so that what they learn is relevant to their needs and can be implemented.

▲Guidelines for Streamlining Local Administration

(1) Financial administration at the local level should be streamlined within a limited time frame, such as implementing the budget and final accounts system, the accounting system, the auditing system, and the independent treasury system in accordance with central laws and regulations, and training financial administration personnel. (2) In provinces and counties where land surveys have not been conducted, in addition to conducting land surveys in accordance with Article 14 of the Provincial and Municipal Land Administration Implementation Procedures, land declarations should be handled in designated areas within a limited time frame in other areas. The funds for the land declarations should be raised by the local government through overall planning, or by reducing administrative expenses or adjusting project expenses. The principle should be to avoid directly levying fees on the people. (3) Police administration should be streamlined in a thorough and practical manner, such as adjusting the organization, improving the service system, raising salaries, improving the quality of personnel, and enriching equipment. These measures must be implemented within a limited time frame. (4) Household registration should be completed within a limited time frame, baojia should be implemented, the people should be trained, and household registration changes or personnel registration should be carried out as the initial steps for preparing for local self-government. (5) Concrete central construction projects should be formulated based on local conditions and the urgent needs of the people, such as road construction, river dredging, and afforestation. Detailed plans must be made and implemented in stages. (6) Agricultural irrigation should be improved in a practical manner, and agricultural improvements should be promoted, such as推广改良種苗promoting the spread of improved seeds and seedlings, preventing and controlling plant pests and diseases, and testing and adopting improved agricultural implements and fertilizers. However, technical guidance should be provided by the central agricultural agencies. (7) The cooperative cause should be promoted according to the needs and capabilities of the country and the people, and people should be guided to establish various cooperative societies for credit, supply, production, marketing, consumption, public services, and insurance. (8) In accordance with regulations, relevant aspects of compulsory education and mass education should be actively promoted in stages, such as raising funds for compulsory education and mass education locally, dividing school districts, investigating school-age children and out-of-school adults, and adding primary schools and mass schools. (9) Local health facilities should be completed in stages, and medical relief and health care and prevention work should be carried out, with particular attention to rural hygiene. (10) County, township, and district administrative personnel should be trained centrally in stages. The training courses should pay special attention to spiritual training, physical training, and the essentials of local administration, production education, and self-government organization, so that what they learn is relevant to their needs and can be implemented.

▲Principles for Reviewing Construction Projects

(1) The term "construction projects" in these principles refers to national defense, economic, cultural, transportation, water conservancy, industrial, and construction projects. The plans and budgets for these projects shall be reviewed by the Construction Project Review Committee (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee"), and the progress of these projects shall also be assessed by the Committee and submitted to the President of the Executive Yuan for approval. The income and expenditure of special funds for these projects shall be reviewed and inspected by the Special Fund Review Committee for Construction Projects. (2) The Committee's review of various construction projects shall be submitted to the President of the Executive Yuan and sent to the competent authorities and the Committee for joint handling. (3) The Committee's review of various construction projects shall focus on assessing the coherence of the various plans and shall provide opinions in accordance with the provisions of these principles and submit them to the President of the Executive Yuan for approval. (4) Construction projects that have a significant impact on national defense or the people's livelihood, and those that require advanced technology, huge capital, or have a controlling nature, shall in principle be undertaken by the central government, but some parts may also be jointly undertaken with local governments and the people, taking into account the actual situation. (5) Special construction projects concerning a province or city that have a significant impact on the economy of the province or city or need to be promoted and improved shall, with the approval of the central government, be undertaken by the local government in principle, but some parts may also be jointly undertaken by the government and the people, taking into account the actual situation. (6) The government should make every effort to promote and encourage people to operate productive enterprises (such as fully purchasing their products, providing transportation convenience, and providing bonuses and interest guarantees). The government should avoid competing with private productive enterprises in operating productive enterprises, so as to invest in the most profitable and most needed areas. (7) Construction projects that should be undertaken by the central government should be handled separately by the competent central government agencies in accordance with the principle of division of labor. (8) Construction projects that should be undertaken by the provincial and municipal governments should be handled separately in accordance with the principle of regional division of labor, so that the construction projects undertaken in various places are suitable for their resource allocation, geographical environment, and market needs. The types and quantities of undertakings should be properly allocated in accordance with the needs of the entire country, and their interrelationships should be adjusted to make the whole country an entire economic unit. (9) The government should guide the business direction of productive enterprises that should be operated by the people, and make every effort to promote and encourage them, so that all undertakings can develop in a balanced and healthy manner. (10) Except in special circumstances, central and local governments should ensure that the income of a productive enterprise is sufficient to cover its expenses and have a surplus after a certain period of time (tentatively set at five years). (11) The source of funds for productive enterprises established by the central and local governments, if public bonds are issued, should be handled under the financial policy of the entire country, so as not to affect the market. In addition, there must be a concrete and detailed plan for each productive enterprise established by borrowing, so that the income of the enterprise itself can gradually repay the principal and interest of the debt within a certain period of time, so that the establishment of the enterprise can be a supplement to the government's finances, rather than a burden on the finances. (12) Each time central and local governments settle accounts for productive enterprises, they must set aside a certain amount from the net profit as a public reserve fund, and the remainder must be distributed reasonably in accordance with laws and regulations. The income from capital allocation should be used for the expansion of the enterprise itself or for other undertakings. (13) Central and local governments should prepare detailed budgets for productive enterprises, such as calculations of costs and estimates of market needs, for review. (14) Central and local governments should report detailed operating reports for construction projects that have already been undertaken, such as balance sheets, profit and loss statements, surplus distribution statements, property inventories, and the progress of previous years, as well as the employment, management, treatment, and equipment of workers, on a regular basis for review.

Current Commentary

### From Blum to Chautemps

— Bin

The cabinets of England and Japan changed not long ago. Now, the Léon Blum cabinet of France has also announced its resignation. The Blum cabinet, since its establishment on June 4th of last year, has just reached its first anniversary. During this period, Blum struggled while being attacked from both inside and outside, striving to deal with France's economic crisis while facing enemies surrounding him. Indeed, he has gone through countless hardships. This time, in order to break through France's financial difficulties, he submitted a bill to the parliament for full financial powers. Although the bill was passed by the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate repeatedly rejected it. Therefore, the Blum cabinet could not stand its ground.

France has always been a country that produces short-lived cabinets. Blum's ability to sit in the prime minister's chair for a year cannot be considered easy. Although the results of his administration during this short year cannot be entirely satisfactory, they are certainly not something that previous cabinets could have achieved. Roughly speaking, on the one hand, he tried his best to curb the rampant forces of fascism, and on the other hand, he tried to improve the lives of the masses. For example, the reorganization of the Bank of France, the dissolution of the Croix-de-Feu, the nationalization of the arms industry, the implementation of the forty-hour work week, the implementation of compulsory labor-management arbitration, and the implementation of large-scale public works projects were all efforts made during this year. In today's France, fascist forces can only operate silently in the dark. The number of unemployed has decreased. The purchasing power of the domestic market has gradually increased. Although the flaws in the finances still cannot be completely repaired, there has been some improvement. All of this must be said to be the merit of the Blum cabinet. Therefore, the Blum cabinet has won the support of the domestic working, peasant, and industrial classes, as well as all pro-democracy elements.

However, on the other hand, these enlightened "New Deal" policies of the Blum cabinet have aroused deep jealousy from domestic financial capitalists and all reactionary factions. Originally, France was a country of financial oligarchy. The wealth of the entire country was concentrated in the hands of two hundred families. Financial capital controlled everything. The Bank of France was originally a tool for oligarchic financial groups to dominate politics. Now that it has been nationalized, they naturally resent it immensely. They secretly tried every possible way to put the Blum government to death. They colluded with domestic and foreign fascist elements to make things difficult for the people's government everywhere. They obstructed the government's various financial measures and transported cash abroad in a continuous stream to shake the foundation of domestic securities credit, thereby creating a chaotic situation of plummeting securities prices and rising prices. In order to stabilize the social finances, the Blum cabinet requested the parliament to grant the government full power to control the nation's finances, but the Senate, which is the stronghold of the oligarchic financial forces in France, finally overturned the full powers bill passed by the Chamber of Deputies. This is the reason for the fall of the Blum cabinet.

However, the sabotage of a small number of oligarchic financial groups and reactionaries seems to be in vain. The departure of the Blum cabinet cannot weaken the power of the French Popular Front's unity. According to yesterday's telegrams, Chautemps of the Radical Socialist Party, with the strong support of the Socialist and Communist Parties, has formed a new cabinet. Six cabinet members are former members of the Blum cabinet. Léon Blum is still serving as Minister of State. In this way, although the prime minister of France has changed from Blum to Chautemps, the essence of the cabinet has not changed in practice. Moreover, after this twist, the unity between the Radical Socialist Party and the Socialist and Communist Parties may become even stronger. And continue to firmly implement the anti-fascist and anti-war policies. Therefore, from the perspective of peace in Europe and even the world, this change of the French cabinet may not be detrimental to the overall situation.

### Coordinating with England and Cooperating with Germany: The Axis of Japanese Diplomacy

England and Japan Are About to Start Formal Negotiations, Seeking British Understanding for the Promotion of the Continental Policy

[Tokyo] Regarding the fact that Japanese Ambassador to England Yoshida has received instructions from Foreign Minister Hirota and is about to begin formal talks with England, Japanese observers believe that "coordination between England and Japan and cooperation between Japan and Germany are the two axes of Japanese diplomacy." Although the form of cooperation between Japan and Germany is only the Anti-Comintern Pact, its substance is equal to a common front against the Soviet Union. Coordination between England and Japan is intended to gain understanding on both the China and trade issues, and especially to seek British recognition of Japan's continental policy. Japan attempts to promote the rapprochement between England and Germany through coordination between England and Japan and lay the foundation for cooperation between England, Japan, and Germany. Therefore, if coordination between England and Japan can succeed, the actual strength of Japan's continental policy will naturally be strengthened, and Japan will also be able to actively advance the issues of China and the Soviet Union." According to these observations, it seems to fully reflect Japan's exact motive for seeking coordination with England. However, whether Japan's continental policy can actually gain British understanding is still questionable. The editorial of the China and Foreign Commercial News this morning, titled "Formal Negotiations Between England and Japan," clearly holds a pessimistic view on the future trend of the negotiations between England and Japan. The newspaper first stated, "The fact that England and Japan can begin formal talks proves that the preliminary talks have already been successful. However, from the perspective of future practical issues, optimism cannot be guaranteed." The newspaper then pointed out that China is deeply concerned about the negotiations between England and Japan, and how England and China have tried to reassure China is something that deserves our close attention. The newspaper also stated, "Regarding trade issues, it is imperative to seek an overall adjustment, as partial understanding is of little significance. Also, regarding the China issue, some kind of understanding may be established, but it is feared that a complete resolution will not be easily obtained." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

### Germany and Italy Announce Withdrawal from West Sea Surveillance Plan

England and France Oppose Naval Demonstration, London Four-Power Talks Break Down

[Paris] Germany and Italy have recently announced their withdrawal from the Spanish Sea Surveillance Plan. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

[London] German Ambassador to England Ribbentrop delivered a note from the German government to the British Foreign Office this morning, stating that "After learning that the German cruiser 'Leipzig' was bombed twice on June 15th and 18th, the German government immediately notified the other three countries jointly monitoring the west coast of Spain, explaining that the German government did not want ships on international missions to be used as targets by the Spanish government again. The German government only requested the minimum guarantee for the safety of its ships, that is, a joint demonstration by the navies of the four countries to express the meaning of mutual defense. However, England and France did not agree to this minimum requirement. The German government regrets that it recognizes the lack of unity among the four countries and has been forced to decide to completely withdraw from the surveillance system." (National Huitong Telegram on the 23rd)

[Rome] The Italian government issued an official statement today formally withdrawing from the Adjustment Council. The original text is as follows: "The Italian government has decided to completely withdraw from the International Surveillance Agency and the London Non-Intervention Committee because it has detected a lack of unity among the four countries at the London Conference (this spirit is necessary for taking concerted action against the Spanish government)." (National Huitong Telegram on the 23rd)

[London] The ambassadors of Germany and Italy to England, after receiving instructions from their respective governments, have separately notified the British government that their countries have now decided to withdraw from the Spanish Sea Surveillance Plan but will still participate in the work of the Adjustment Council and continue to accept the restrictions stipulated in the Non-Intervention Agreement. (Central News Agency on the 23rd)

[London] Negotiations among England, France, Germany, and Italy regarding the attack on the German cruiser "Leipzig" have now broken down. It is reported that England and France advocated an investigation, while Germany and Italy demanded an immediate naval demonstration off the coast of Valencia to express the unity of the four countries. Since a compromise was not achieved, a new situation has arisen. As for the nature of the new situation, it depends on the unilateral actions that Germany decides to take. It is hoped that Germany will not immediately withdraw from the Four-Power Agreement, because although this consultation has failed, the mechanism established by the June 12 Agreement can still handle future events. German Head of State Hitler summoned his main advisers for a meeting to discuss and decide on Germany's future attitude towards the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War after receiving a report that the consultation had failed. People in Berlin believe that since negotiations have failed and the situation has changed, although officials deny that Germany intends to withdraw from the Non-Intervention Committee, since understanding cannot be obtained under the Four-Power Agreement, Germany should regain its freedom of action. People in Rome do not regard the breakdown of negotiations as unusual, and responsible parties acknowledge that Italy firmly supports Germany's demand for a naval demonstration outside the port of Valencia.

After the representatives of England, France, Italy, and Germany held their last meeting at the British Foreign Office, they issued a communiqué explaining the reasons why a compromise was not reached, saying that it was unfortunate that it was found impossible to agree on a plan that should be adopted for the case. On the one hand, it was believed that proposals that could improve the safety of the surveillance warships of the four countries should be studied jointly, but the circumstances at the time of the attack should be investigated first, and then measures should be taken against the parties related to Spain. At the same time, on the other hand, it was believed that the facts had already been clearly established, no investigation was necessary, and active measures should be taken immediately to maintain the unity of the four countries and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. What all parties failed to compromise on was the proposal to hold a demonstration by the warships of the four countries immediately off the coast of Valencia.

According to a communiqué issued in Berlin, it is certain that two Spanish submarines appeared near the "Leipzig" on the day it was attacked. This has been proven. The fact that two Red Army submarines fired on the positions of the National Army near Garahanda, east of Malaga, on June 16 is sufficient to prove the falsehood that no Spanish submarines had sailed out of port when the "Leipzig" was attacked, because the locations where the "Leipzig" was attacked on June 15 and 18 were both near Olen, which is half a day's journey from Garahanda. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)

### Germany Convenes Emergency Meeting

Military Leaders All Attend, Atmosphere in Berlin Quite Tense

[Berlin] The German government convened a meeting at noon today. In addition to the ministers, German Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder and Army Commander-in-Chief Fritsch also attended to discuss the content. It is reported that the meeting was about the German government's response to the repeated attacks on German ships by the Spanish government after the Four-Power Conference broke up. (National Huitong Telegram on the 23rd)

[Berlin] Since the Four-Power Conference broke up without result, the atmosphere throughout Germany has suddenly become tense, not only among government officials but also in public opinion. When the cabinet met to discuss this issue, countless excited and impassioned groups of people gathered in the square in front of the meeting venue, believing that an important resolution was about to be announced. According to political figures, the government may issue a statement this afternoon, indicating the steps and paths that Germany is prepared to take after the collapse of the Four-Power Conference on the surveillance of the west coast. Whether Germany will automatically take retaliatory steps or completely withdraw from the surveillance mechanism will depend on national public opinion. According to speculation by political figures, the German government may decide not to be bound by the current non-intervention policy. (National Huitong Telegram on the 23rd)

### Britain and France Maintain Close Contact

Prudent Actions Urged on Germany, Avoiding Endangering Peace

[London] Regarding the "Leipzig" incident, well-informed sources here have stated that the British and French governments agreed last night to separately instruct their respective ambassadors to Germany to inform the German government that, regarding all actions of the Spanish Republican government that could cause international disputes and endanger European peace, they must take steps to avoid them. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 23rd)

[London] British political figures deeply regret the confirmation that Germany and Italy have withdrawn from the monitoring plan. It is said that, fortunately, the German government has not yet acted freely, so as to endanger European peace. However, the Western Mediterranean monitoring plan is actually a safeguard for the smooth implementation of the non-intervention agreement. Now that Germany and Italy have declared their withdrawal, whether this agreement can continue to be implemented must be discussed. The British government will conduct talks with the French authorities. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 23rd)

### Geneva Observers Analyze the European Situation

[Geneva] Regarding the confirmed withdrawal of Germany and Italy from the Western Mediterranean monitoring plan, international figures here generally believe that this move could, to some extent, endanger the European situation. What is unknown is how Germany and Italy will use their restored freedom of action. In addition, it is generally believed that the Spanish Republican government should protest to the League of Nations regarding Germany's claims arising from the "Leipzig" incident, and request an investigation to clarify the truth. As to whether the intervention of the League of Nations Council will be effective, it is not possible to say. Furthermore, well-informed sources also stated that when the Council met last month, it entrusted the Spanish issue to the London Adjustment Committee for handling. Although Germany and Italy have withdrawn from the maritime monitoring plan, whether the Council will hold a meeting to discuss it is still uncertain. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 23rd)

### US Remains Silent

[Washington] Regarding the German cruiser "Leipzig" incident, someone asked Assistant Secretary of State Welles whether the US government intends to make representations to the German Ambassador to the US, Dieckhoff, as Secretary of State Hull did after the German warship recently shelled the Spanish port of Almería. Welles declined to comment, only stating that the State Department has not received any reports regarding the "Leipzig" incident. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 22nd)

### Italy and Germany Collude and Take Unified Steps

Retaining Full Freedom of Action, Italy Prepares to Send More Troops to Aid in the War in Spain

[Berlin] German officials are very dissatisfied after Britain and France rejected Germany's proposal regarding the "Leipzig" incident. Political figures have also stated that, according to the four-power agreement of the 12th of this month, Germany has been able to restore freedom of action and take all measures to respond to the attacks by Spanish government forces on the "Leipzig." It is generally believed that Germany should conduct a large-scale demonstration in the Mediterranean. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 23rd)

[Rome] Regarding the German warship "Leipzig" incident, after the four-power conference in London (Britain, France, Germany, and Italy) reached a deadlock, the Fascist Party headquarters here issued an opinion stating that Italy completely agrees with Germany's views. Germany will probably take strong measures to deal with the "red party" in Spain. Therefore, if Germany takes the lead in any action, Italy will certainly follow. As a result, the countries involved may even restore freedom of action regarding the Spanish issue. In short, Italy will follow Germany, rather than initiate anything. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 22nd)

[Rome] Judging from the situation here today, Prime Minister Mussolini seems to be seriously considering increasing reinforcements to help the Spanish rebel army in its war effort. It is reported that Mussolini may intend to send official troops to assist General Franco, commander-in-chief of the rebel army. However, it is not known whether he is prepared to openly intervene in the Spanish civil war. The most reliable sources say that at least several Italian generals have been ordered to prepare their troops in advance so that they can be sent abroad to serve at any time. One division of 15,000 men is now ready to move at any time. (National Telegram, 22nd)

### Spanish Rebel Army Reassures the Safety of Foreign Warships

[London] The British government recently sent a message on behalf of the four countries participating in the monitoring work off the Spanish coast to both sides of the Spanish conflict, regarding the safety of the monitoring warships. Today, the Salamanca Nationalist authorities have replied, stating that the Nationalist army is willing to provide complete safety for the warships of the four countries engaged in monitoring work on the high seas and elsewhere, and is prepared to designate safe zones within Spanish government ports so that the monitoring warships can avoid being mistakenly attacked by the Nationalist army. The Spanish government's reply has not yet been received. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 22nd)

Attacking Santander by Sea and Land

Andaye The Spanish Nationalist army's recent capture of Bilbao has resulted in obtaining many mining, steelmaking, and ironworking factories in the Bay of Biscay area. They are now advancing on the west bank of the Nervión River. The Nationalist army occupied this important industrial zone without much resistance. The Nationalist army is sending troops to attack Santander, where the government army's garrison has approximately 110,000 soldiers, but is lacking in equipment such as airplanes, tanks, and artillery. The Nationalist warship "Sevilla" has begun shelling the government army's positions along the Bay of Biscay. (National Telegram, 22nd)

### The People's Self-Defense Movement in Jehol and Chahar is Nearing Completion

Li Tingfang Has Ordered All Routes to Conduct Activities Separately; Rebels Have Repeatedly Held Meetings to Discuss Countermeasures

Wanping Communication The self-defense movement of the people in northern Chahar and western Jehol has been brewing for many days, and they have now contacted each other and are collectively called the People's Self-Defense Army. Its commander-in-chief, Li Tingfang, seeing that the Mongolian and Han people in various places have responded one after another, with great momentum, ordered the general commanders of all routes under his command on the 13th of this month to take unified action and advance separately, in order to achieve the goals of recovering lost territories and armed self-defense. So far, there have been traces of the People's Self-Defense Army in the area around Jingpeng Avenue and Lama Temple in Jehol, and in Guyuan, Chongli, Shangyi, and other places in northern Chahar, and they are currently in a stalemate with the puppet army. In addition, a Mongolian "Lawang Songye" led more than 2,000 Mongolian and Han righteous people, intending to go straight from the Houcaodi Pangjiang to the old nests of Jiasiasi and Prince De's Mansion, with great momentum. Li Shouxin, Prince De, and others have repeatedly held emergency meetings with a certain Yang officer to discuss countermeasures. He has ordered his puppet artillery commander, Ding Qichang, to deploy heavy troops around Shangdu, preparing to fight against the Self-Defense Army and prevent the Sui Army from taking the opportunity to attack. The situation on all sides is described separately below:

Guyuan Has the Potential to be Captured Soon

After Li Tingfang, commander-in-chief of the People's Self-Defense Army, ordered his troops to conduct activities separately, Li Ying, the general commander of the First Route, led more than 2,000 armed people from Heihechuan, Jehol, on the 13th of this month, and advanced towards Guyuan. On the 14th, Bao Yueqing, the commander of the puppet army's First Division, personally led the entire division to meet and intercept them, and the two sides immediately came into contact. At the same time, someone from the Self-Defense Army's branch team, commander Zhang Haifeng, also led more than 1,000 armed people with complete rifles and horses from Jingpeng County, Jehol, to Guyuan to meet them. On the 14th, Li Ying's troops also clashed with more than 800 bandits and puppet troops of the Fifth Army around Lama Temple. As of the 16th, the two sides were still in a stalemate. This People's Self-Defense Army, after starting from Jehol, has the potential to capture Guyuan soon.

Chongli County Seat Could Be Recovered Soon

Xing Ziqiang, who has prepared strength between Chongli and Zhangbei, waiting for an opportunity to revolt, has accepted the appointment of Li Tingfang, commander-in-chief of the People's Self-Defense Army, as the commander of the Third Route Guerrilla of the People's Self-Defense Army. On the 15th, he led more than 300 cavalry to attack Xiwancun, Chongli County again (the city is only 50 li away from Zhangbei). As of today, they are still in a stalemate. In addition, Tang Zhuoqun, commander of the Third Branch Team, has now been ordered by Li Tingfang to cooperate with Xing. In terms of strength, Chongli County should not be difficult to recover soon.

Mongols Have Awakened, Destroying the Old Nest Directly

In addition, Zhang Zhongying, the general commander of the Second Route of the People, previously led 500 armed people, intending to capture the 23 cavalry patrol team members of the Nanhaochuan Police Station. The entire squad took their rifles and horses to surrender to Zhang's troops. Zhang, knowing that the Nanhaochuan puppet army was already prepared, in order to avoid the important and take the light, ordered the cavalry patrol team to act as a guide and change to Shangyi County (i.e., Daqinggou). As of the 16th, it had not yet been successful. In addition, the Mongolian La Wang Songye (transliteration), deeply angered by the rebels' insane and crazy behavior, has recently united with Zhang Zhongying and personally led more than 2,000 Mongolian and Han troops, all cavalry, known as the Fourth Route General Commander of the Mongolian and Han People's Self-Defense Army, determined to go straight from the Houcaodi to Pangjiang and attack the old nests of the rebel Prince De's Mansion and Jiabusi in the Western Sonite Banner

The Disintegration of the Mongolians and Hans Hastens the Rebels' Collapse

Communications from various places in northern Chahar show that the people are arming themselves in self-defense and that the momentum is growing daily. The general rebels such as Prince De and Li Shouxin, as well as a certain Special Affairs Officer, are aware that the Mongolians and Hans in northern Chahar are disintegrating and that the rebels' situation is becoming increasingly desperate. Therefore, they are extremely fearful of each other and have repeatedly held emergency meetings to discuss countermeasures. On the 14th of this month, the puppet artillery commander, Ding Qichang, was ordered to deploy heavy troops in Shangdu, first, to prepare to resist the armed people's conflict, and second, to guard against the Sui East Garrison taking advantage of the internal disturbances to launch a sudden attack. As for the thorough prevention method of this People's Self-Defense, observing their recent uncoordinated actions, it seems that they already feel it is thorny. The only way is to win over the general rebel leaders such as Li Shouxin and Prince De, strictly order their subordinates to endure and wait for the opportunity, and after carefully investigating the true strength of the Self-Defense Army, they will have a corresponding way to deal with it.

### Aftermath of the Tianjin Sheng Nongyuan Case

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ordered the Tianjin Municipal Government to Thoroughly Investigate the Truth of the Corpse Burning; After Gu Enfu's Release, Traitors are Rampant Again

Tianjin Communication The case of the Japanese Sheng Nongyuan farm in Chentangzhuang, Tianjin County, being burned this month was extremely serious in the first ten days of this month. A certain newspaper in Pingjin attacked Chen Zhongyue, the magistrate of Tianjin County, as an anti-Japanese leader. After Magistrate Chen was ordered to temporarily release Gu Enfu, who privately leased state land, it was quelled. However, the newspaper still fabricated facts, first saying that the fire at Sheng Nongyuan was caused by students from a certain university in the suburbs of Tianjin at the instigation of Magistrate Chen. It then claimed that a dead body was found at the fire, and that it was the arsonist who accidentally entered the house and was burned to death. When the dead body was discovered on the second day of the fire, the newspaper first intended to prove that the body was that of a certain foreigner in order to expand the situation. Fortunately, Magistrate Chen had already inquired when he inspected the fire on the day of the fire that there were a total of fifteen Japanese in the garden, in addition to the garden owner, Shimain San, and his wife and son, there were also Sato, Kubokawa, Yoneda, Matsui, Sato, Miura, Abe, Seo, Ogawa, Jida, and Otani Kuragen, a total of twelve people, and none were missing. Therefore, the issue of the corpse did not cause any problems. However, although the corpse was proven to be Chinese, the question of the Chinese's surname remains a major question, and the reason for being burned to death is still a major question. After Magistrate Chen went to verify the results, the corpse was lying supine, with no muscle contraction, the neck stretched straight, and the color was charred black. Ma Xiangli, the prosecutor of the Tianjin District Court, inspected the scene and also believed that there were still many doubts about whether the state of death was being burned to death before death, or being burned after death. And who is the name of this corpse? Recently, it has attracted attention from all parties. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the burned corpse was Wang Hongjie, a detective of the Tianjin County Police Department. Because Gu Enfu was captured by Wang, a certain party hated him the most, and brought him to his death. At this moment, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed the Tianjin Municipal Government to thoroughly investigate. The reporter met Chen Zhongyue, the head of Tianjin County, on the morning of the 21st. According to Chen, the case of Gu Enfu's private lease of state land occurred in March of this year, and he was repeatedly ordered to cancel the lease, but he failed to do so, so he was arrested and detained at the end of May. The person who carried the warrant to arrest him was Mao Jinbo, the political police officer of the county government, not Wang Hongjie, and the county police station also had no one by the name of Wang Hongjie as a detective. It can be proved that what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs heard was a false rumor. Magistrate Chen also said that since February of this year, the county government has discovered as many as six or seven cases of land being privately leased or sold to a certain foreigner. The county government has complied with the orders to strictly ban them, but the traitors each rely on the concession as a protective charm, making it difficult to arrest them one by one. Since Gu Enfu was released by the Japanese leader through a strong case, ordinary traitors have been rampant again. In order to maintain national sovereignty, no matter how much the traitors resent me, I can only disregard my own safety and well-being for the sake of my duty. (21st)

### New Trends in Chaozhou-Meizhou Immigration

From Southeast Asia to Hainan and Western Fujian; The Authorities Cooperate and the People Are Happy to Abandon the Former and Embrace the Latter

Shantou Communication Chaozhou and Meizhou are densely populated. The residents of the fifteen counties are about 12 million, accounting for one-third of the population of Guangdong Province. According to a survey last year, Chaozhou and Meizhou have 1,062,000 acres of farmland, accounting for one-fifth of the cultivated land in the province. Barren mountains and open spaces are everywhere. In the past, the government had no plan for rectification, and allowed them to remain barren, resulting in a shortage of eight months of food crops each year, relying entirely on foreign rice to help the people. This is the general situation of Chaozhou-Meizhou society. Driven by the environment, many people crossed over to Hainan to seek a living. People passing through Shantou to go abroad

The average number of people per year is about 120,000, and only more than 80,000 return, accounting for one-third, residing in Siam, Malaya, Dutch East Indies, Java, Annam, India, and the Philippines. Southeast Asia has become a tailpipe for the excessive population of Chaozhou and Meizhou. People in the country who have traveled to Southeast Asia all agree that Southeast Asia is the second Chaozhou and Meizhou. The people of Chaozhou and Meizhou also regard Southeast Asia as their second hometown. However, in recent years, various ports in Southeast Asia have established immigration bureaus to restrict the number of people and increase the entry tax and residence tax. Therefore, before setting off, they do not dare to go to Southeast Asia rashly without raising three to four hundred yuan in travel expenses in advance. It is not easy for poor farmers in the countryside to raise such a large amount of travel expenses. Fortunately, the country has now been unified.

The National Economic Construction Committee has started planning to improve the people's livelihood. Although there has been no significant progress recently, land administration, land reclamation, afforestation, water conservancy, road construction, river dredging, etc. can all be gradually promoted according to procedures. The trend of Chaozhou-Meizhou immigration is gradually changing with the stability of politics. Now the government has decided to develop Qiongyai. The climate and products of Qiongyai are roughly the same as those in Southeast Asia. Chaozhou-Meizhou people living abroad have long been paying attention to Qiongzhou. Several years ago, thousands of households from Meizhou had moved to Qiongyai,

At present, if a poor farmer who wants to go to Southeast Asia can raise his travel expenses of three to four hundred yuan, he can move to Hainan Island and immediately become a small landlord who can support himself. In today's clear political situation, the new trend of immigration to Qiongyai has been fully expressed before the people. The second is immigration to western Fujian. The areas of Longyan, Liancheng, Qingliu, Changting, Yongding, Shanghang, Wuping and Ninghua in western Fujian are the birthplace of the ancestors of the people of Meizhou in the past. The records, customs, habits, and prices are exactly the same. In recent years, the Communists have occupied western Fujian and made chaos. The young men were coerced to flee north, the war zone extended for more than 20,000 li, and there were deaths everywhere. More than half of the land was barren.

Now the area of western Fujian is stable, and road transportation is convenient. Although immigration is said to be not as long-distance as going to Southeast Asia, there is no suffering from leaving the hometown. Moreover, the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry recently sent technicians to investigate the soil quality. The governments of Jieyang and Boluo counties are responsible for planning immigration matters. The Rural Cooperative Committee agreed to supply immigrants with clothing, food, housing, farming tools, seeds, etc., which will be repaid gradually in the following years. Therefore, the people of Chaozhou and Meizhou are happy to take this new path.

### Songjiang

Public Announcement of Land Prices Causes Repercussions

The land prices in this county have been announced by the Land Administration Bureau. Local people have generally pointed out that the assessed land prices do not refer to the reported prices, nor are they based on the recent market value.

The announcement procedures were also not submitted to the county government for review in advance, or submitted to the People's Representative Meeting for discussion and resolution, which is far from the provisions of Article 241 of the Land Law and Article 6 of the Land Implementation Law. Therefore, Cheng Weiru, chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, Du Gui, director of the Real Estate Management Office, Chen Qiushi, chairman of the Lawyers Association, and Zhang Baopei, chairman of the Charity Board of Directors, telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Land Administration Bureau to request rectification.

### The Yarn Exchange Turmoil: Central Government Strictly Investigates, 42 Brokers Suspended

Request to the Executive Chief for Remedies, Extension of Delivery Allowed for Three Days - Representatives from Various Yuan and Bu Continue to Investigate Manipulating Accounts in Detail

After the Executive Chief Wu Dingchang came to Shanghai to reinvestigate and meticulously review the brokers' accounts, the situation in the yarn exchange market took a turn for the worse. Forty-two brokerage firms were ordered by the Executive Department to suspend operations for two days starting tomorrow, punishing the exchange's brokers. Yesterday morning, the brokers paid their respects to Executive Chief Wu, requesting remedies. The Executive Chief specially approved a two-day extension for this month's delivery. The brokers' association re-nominated representatives to petition at 6 PM. Details of the situation are recorded as follows:

Yesterday Morning, the Yuan and Bu Continued to Investigate

After Minister Wu thoroughly investigated the board of directors of the yarn and cloth exchange and the account statements of various brokers starting on the morning of the 22nd, the investigation of the board of directors had already been completed. At 9 AM yesterday morning, Yan Shenyu, Director of General Affairs of the Ministry of Industry, Zhang Youlun, Commissioner of the Control Yuan, Yan Zhuang, Counselor, and Cen Dezhang, Counselor of the Executive Yuan, went to the exchange again to investigate in detail the lists of entrusted buying and selling, account statements, and bank and money shop transaction books of various brokers, all from May 1st to June 8th. It is said that the names of those who manipulated the market have already been found. After reporting to the central government in the future, they will definitely be severely punished according to the law.

Punishing Brokers, Requesting Remedies

Since the Executive Chief came to Shanghai to reinvestigate the market manipulation case of the yarn and cloth exchange and summoned all sixty-odd brokers to inquire about everything, forty-two brokers changed their agents and accountants to attend. Considering it a serious neglect of the law, in order to express sincere intentions, the Ministry of Industry, based on Article 42 of the Exchange Law, informed the exchange to instruct the forty-two brokers to cease business for three days starting from the 24th of this month (i.e., tomorrow) for processing. Because the 24th is the cotton delivery date of the month, and the 25th is the cotton yarn delivery date, the above-mentioned brokers who were entrusted to buy and sell this month's futures contracts will inevitably have to handle the delivery at that time. Now that they are punished with a suspension of business during the suspension period, they cannot trade and cannot entrust other brokers to trade on their behalf. Things are difficult and remedies are sought. It is said that Minister Wu agreed to extend the market delivery date by several days to avoid delivery difficulties. Cotton will be delivered on July 3rd, and cotton yarn will be delivered on July 5th.

Holidays on July 1st and 2nd

Yesterday, the yarn and cloth exchange issued Notice No. 2023, stating that July 1st and 2nd are bank holidays, and the exchange will temporarily close for two days. In addition to notifying the brokers' association, this notice is hereby issued. Another notice, No. 2026, stated that the exchange will be temporarily closed on July 1st and 2nd. It has already been announced that starting from the 26th of this month, all brokers will use bank and money shop drafts with a date of July 2nd for daily receipts and payments. In addition to notifying the brokers' association, this notice is hereby issued.

Convening a Meeting to Nominate Members to Petition

The brokers' association reconvened an interim full executive committee meeting at 11:30 this morning in the meeting room on the second floor of the exchange. More than 20 committee members, including official and alternate members, attended. Chairman Bu Wenmei announced the situation of the Executive Chief's visit to Shanghai to reinvestigate the yarn exchange turmoil and the suspension of 42 brokers for three days. Then, various committee members successively expressed their opinions. It was decided that Presidents Shao and Zhou would visit Director Du and accompany him to visit Executive Chief Wu, requesting exemption from punishment to maintain business. However, the Executive Chief did not consider it and resolutely refused.

Seventeen Firms Still Trading as Usual

The total number of brokers doing cotton yarn business in the yarn exchange market is 63, but 4 are empty shells, so the actual number is only 59. Now, 41 have been punished with a three-day suspension. The other 17 are still trading as usual today. In order to prevent instability in the market, the brokers' association specially convened 17 brokers at 2 PM yesterday to report the situation and sincerely guided the brokers to avoid accidents when trading in the market tomorrow (i.e., today). The brokers all agreed and left.

Market Prices Are Still Relatively Stable

Yesterday, the exchange market still opened as usual for four sessions in the morning and afternoon, for a total of eight sessions. The prices did not experience any sharp rises or falls. The fourth session prices for each month's futures contracts are recorded as follows: (Morning Market) June contract: 266 yuan, July contract: 268 yuan, August contract: 270 yuan, September contract: 27 yuan; (Afternoon Market) June contract: 269.5 yuan, July contract: 269.5 yuan, August contract: 273.7 yuan, September contract: 275 yuan. Afternoon market prices were slightly higher than morning market prices, but still stable.

### Executive Chief Wu Inspects the Flour Exchange, Strictly Prohibits Manipulation

Brokers to Hold Meeting This Morning

The flour exchange once experienced a storm on the 9th of this month. The exchange authorities tried their best to deal with it. They suspended new trading on the 10th, and increased the margin. The market stabilized slightly. New trading was resumed on the 19th. The market has gradually stabilized in recent days. Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry believed that flour was of great importance to the people's livelihood, so he was very concerned about the flour market. Yesterday afternoon at about 3 PM, he personally accompanied Wang Xiaolai and Yu Kaizhan, supervisors of the exchange, to the flour exchange. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Board, and Directors Gu Xinyi, Xu Qinan, and Hu Yunzhuang, received him. Minister Wu inquired in detail about the market prices and transaction volumes of each month in the exchange, as well as the rise and fall situation after the suspension and resumption of new trading. He greatly praised the board of directors for handling the storm and quickly restoring stability. At the same time, in order to prevent speculation and manipulation, he immediately issued a written instruction on the spot to Director Du to comply with. He left at about 4 PM. His hand-written instruction said: "Flour is related to the people's livelihood, and speculation and manipulation will absolutely not be allowed. Recently, it has been heard that the exchange's transactions inevitably violate Article 52 of the Exchange Law. In addition to the board of directors of the exchange already establishing restrictions and the Ministry sending personnel to investigate strictly, the chairman of the board should warn all brokers to carefully accept their entrusted buying and selling. Any entrustment from non-flour factories and firms must not be accepted. The board of directors is responsible for assessing at any time. If there is any violation, the Ministry will immediately punish them in accordance with the provisions of Article 42 of the Exchange Law." Wu Dingchang, 26.6.23.

### Not Buying or Selling Smuggled Goods, Requesting Punishment of Li Tonghua

Insuring Private Sugar Merchants - Most Illegal and Disobedient

The Shanghai Committee for Not Buying or Selling Smuggled Goods telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, Please see. Regarding the approval of the joint letter from 23 anti-smuggling comrades, including Yuan Xiaolu of Jinan, 'Respectfully informing that since the rampant smuggling in North China last year, the impact on the national economy and people's livelihood has been profound. Our government selected key points along the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways to first set up customs anti-smuggling inspection offices to curb smuggling. The customs inspectors at Jinan Station only have seven or eight people, which is insufficient. As a result, there were incidents of smugglers beating customs officers last year. Afterwards, the government, with a fearless spirit, worked hard to fight smuggling, dispatched six armed tax police brigades to be stationed in Jinan, and appointed Customs Officer Li Tonghua as the director of the Jinan Customs Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office for Public Roads to command anti-smuggling. Anyone with a conscience and a sense of national responsibility, bearing this important task, should eliminate smugglers and smugglers and do their best to abide by the law and fight smuggling to report to the government and the public. Unexpectedly, Li Tonghua was blinded by profit, lost his mind, and colluded with local ruffians, taking advantage of his position to collect insurance premiums from the city's smuggled sugar merchants in exchange for not dispatching police to investigate. The news spread on the roads, and everyone knew about it. The comrades believed that the bribery was conducted secretly and it was difficult to obtain evidence. Only by relying on facts to obtain evidence did they widely gather anti-smuggling comrades to investigate the location of the smuggled sugar storage and secretly report to the office. Li Tonghua used the excuse that the situation in Shandong was special and refused to fight smuggling and repeatedly rejected the secret reports. The comrades sent staff members to question him severely, saying that since he knew the situation was special, why didn't he report it to his superiors to cancel the office and withdraw the armed tax police to avoid setting up a dummy agency and wasting public funds. Moreover, since the pacification of the Xi'an Incident, the smuggling situation in Jinan has long improved. All Chinese and foreign smugglers should be vigilant. Why should he evade responsibility by saying that the situation is special? Li Tonghua, knowing that he could not refuse, pretended to accept, but never immediately appointed a member to go with the reporters to identify and seize the smugglers. He always delayed for one or two days, or even ten days, before investigating, during which he secretly instructed the smuggled merchants to transport the goods elsewhere to avoid being caught. Although the comrades had sent the facts of each case to the competent authorities for investigation, Li Tonghua possessed a lot of money and used his connections to remain safe and sound. The comrades had no choice but to select the cases with the most obvious evidence of bribery and the most illegal and disobedient acts from the confidential reports and filed a public prosecution with the Jinan Local Court. Now that the court has approved the subpoena, the comrades are deeply afraid that Li Tonghua is powerful and will hinder the progress of the case. They urgently request your strong support and ask you to forward this letter to the Director-General of Customs, requesting that he first order the suspension of Li Tonghua's position according to regulations during the litigation period to avoid suspicion and to avoid destroying evidence, so as to attract the attention of the national compatriots, so that corrupt officials can be punished and profiteers can be warned. and so on.' Accordingly, it should be presented to you. We beg you to investigate thoroughly. If it is true, we beg you to severely punish him to show the law and to safeguard the foundation of the country. We cannot help but hope for the best. The Shanghai Committee for Not Buying or Selling Smuggled Goods kowtows."

### Xingye Trust Society Sponsors the Pudong Waterworks, Held an Opening Ceremony Yesterday

General Manager Xu Reports on the Construction Process, Director of the Health Bureau Delivers a Speech, Hoping for Two Points

The Shanghai Pudong Waterworks, sponsored by the Shanghai Xingye Trust Society, held an opening ceremony yesterday morning (23rd) and invited people from all walks of life to visit the factory and offered refreshments. The details are recorded as follows:

Inviting People from All Walks of Life

The factory specially sent personnel to the Dongchang Wharf and the Bund Wharf on Beijing Road to receive people from all walks of life in Puxi after they crossed the river to Pudong. Then, the society hired special vehicles to transport them to the Pudong Waterworks on Youlong Road and prepared refreshments to entertain the guests. The Pudong Police Sub-Bureau temporarily dispatched police to protect the invited guests, including Fu Xiaoan, Qi Yanfang, Xu Peihuang, Li Tingan, Li Luqi, Shen Yi, Xu Xinliu, Wu Yu, Wu Yunqi, Zhou Zuomin, Lu Bohong, Yao Mulian, Xu Baoming, etc., more than a hundred people, who were warmly received by Xu Fu, General Manager of the Society, and Tan Boying, Manager.

Xu's Report

During the banquet, General Manager Xu first reported that the Pudong area is vast and the population is increasing day by day. Health and fire-fighting facilities have not been taken care of. The municipal government, in view of this, ordered our society to prepare for the establishment of a waterworks in October of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. After receiving the order, our society raised capital, hired experts, designated a site, built a factory, sought water sources, and studied water-making methods. Today, we have finally succeeded. This matter is related to public welfare, so profits and losses are not taken into account. Because the river water in the Youlong Road section is deeper, the factory is located here. All the machines are of the latest type and are powered by electricity. Although our society has put in a lot of effort, some of the equipment is not complete at the beginning of the establishment, and we will gradually expand the first phase of the water supply area, starting from Qichang Wharf in the north to Tangqiao in the south, and the second phase from Yangjing District in the north to Bailianjing in the south. The water quality currently produced has been tested and qualified by the Health Testing Institute. In terms of fire protection, it was suitable for the three fires that occurred in Pudong the other day, and the fire was extinguished immediately after the factory supplied water. The establishment of our factory has been guided by the municipal government and related bureaus, the assistance of local people and the waterworks in Zhabei and Nanshi, and the guidance of Chinese and Western guests today. I am deeply grateful.

Li's Speech

Li Tingan then delivered a speech, saying that the Pudong area is the most incomplete in terms of sanitation, with floating houses everywhere and clogged rivers. As the person in charge of sanitation, I feel ashamed, but the mayor is very concerned about sanitation in Pudong. He has ordered the bureau to prepare for the establishment of the Pudong Health Office in Pudong, hoping to establish it as soon as possible to gradually improve sanitation in Pudong. The establishment of your factory is of great help in terms of sanitation and fire protection. It is expected that after the establishment of your factory, citizens of Pudong can reduce diseases and their lives and property will be protected. However, I hope that in the future: ㊀ More attention should be paid to management so that citizens can use it happily. ㊁ Education should be promoted to make citizens aware of the benefits of using tap water. ㊂ The government and society should unite to expand business. In short, the establishment of the waterworks is of great benefit to the citizens of Pudong, so the authorities and society have a responsibility to develop it. Finally, Qu Shaoyi of the Pudong Fellow Association delivered a speech, and then Manager Tan and others led the guests to visit the entire area and dispersed.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Yuan and Ministry Again Requesting a Ban on Wheat Exports

Poor Wheat Harvest This Year - Should Inspect When Necessary

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry again yesterday, requesting a ban on wheat exports. The report stated, "The Chamber of Commerce convened the eighth members' congress on June 19. According to the proposal from the flour factory industry association members, it is proposed to ask the government to issue a clear order prohibiting the export of wheat to protect the people's food. The proposal stated that the domestic wheat harvest this year is declining, and the factory's raw materials will be difficult to meet the needs. There are rumors of foreign merchants shipping wheat, and there is a trend of insufficient food for the people. During this national crisis, considering economic construction and national defense resources, it is necessary to prohibit the export of wheat. A document has been submitted to the government, requesting that it be resolutely implemented. Later, the Ministry of Industry issued a reply, stating that the export certificates for wheat this year, according to customs reports, are not very high, and the numbers have been declining from January to March. The request to prohibit exports can be considered by consulting with the Ministry of Finance and submitting a report to the Yuan for approval in accordance with the temporary measures for food regulation when it is deemed necessary. These documents are on file. After hearing the order, the manufacturers should not sell them again. However, it is found that this year's floods and droughts in various provinces are all over the north and south, and the wheat harvest is less than 70% of last year. Last year, flour factories stopped working and reduced their labor force due to insufficient raw materials. Only half a year of business has been done. The statistics of flour tax can be reviewed. This year's wheat harvest is poor. If foreign merchants are allowed to ship it again without prohibition, not only will flour factories be difficult to maintain, but workers will be unemployed, and it will have a great impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, our association believes that when new wheat is on the market, foreign merchants have not yet shipped it in large quantities, so it is indeed necessary to prohibit exports. Therefore, we will re-enumerate the facts and respectfully ask your association to present them at the general meeting for discussion, and to forward them to the Executive Yuan, the Ministries of Industry and Finance, and to approve the promulgation of a ban on wheat exports in accordance with the temporary measures for food regulation to protect the people's food and maintain the flour industry. I will be grateful for your support. After discussion and deliberation, the general meeting believes that the ministry's reply that it will inspect the situation at any time and report the proposal for prohibition when necessary is originally for the sake of both agriculture and commerce, and is for the sake of adapting to the times. The 'inspecting at any time' should refer to the relationship between supply and demand. Now that the wheat harvest is less than 70% of last year, it is in line with the ministry's statement that it is necessary when necessary. It is agreed to forward it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry and to propose a ban on wheat exports. The case has been prepared and submitted to the Yuan (Ministry) for approval and implementation, which is for the public convenience."

### Shanghai Brewery Workers Still on Strike Yesterday

The Factory Recruited 30 New Workers; Old Workers Proposed Eight Conditions

The entire workforce of the British-owned Shanghai Brewery Company at No. 130 Yichang Road went on strike the day before due to the factory's refusal to meet their demands for wage increases and the reinstatement of dismissed workers. The details were reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the labor and management sides remained deadlocked. The old workers did not enter the factory to work, and the factory recruited 30 new workers in an attempt to resume operations. The details are as follows:

Cause of the Strike

The Shanghai Brewery has been in operation for over a decade, with a total of 175 workers. Its annual turnover is approximately one million yuan, making it highly profitable. The cause of this strike has been brewing for two and a half months. In May of this year, the factory dismissed three workers: Xu Xueqing, Zhang Changsheng, and Li Jiaji. Subsequently, the labor side nominated ten representatives to negotiate with the factory. At that time, the factory replied that it would consider their reinstatement after two months. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, the labor side again negotiated with the factory, reiterating the conditions for reinstatement. This dragged on until last week, when the factory promised to reinstate them this Monday. However, when the deadline arrived, the factory failed to fulfill its promise, which sparked public outrage. As a result, the situation escalated on the day before yesterday, and the entire workforce had no choice but to go on strike.

Eight Conditions

Afterwards, the workers put forward eight conditions: ㊀ Workers should not be dismissed without reason; ㊁ Demand a 20% increase in wages; ㊂ Pay double wages for one month at the end of the year; ㊃ Workers should not be verbally or physically abused in the future; ㊄ Issue one month's pension each year; ㊅ Dismissed workers should be reinstated on a specified date; ㊆ Wages should be paid as usual for Sundays when work is suspended; ㊇ Demand the dismissal of foreman Pan Hairong. However, after the conditions were proposed, the factory only agreed to the sixth condition and flatly rejected all the others.

Recruiting New Workers

After the entire workforce went on strike the day before yesterday, the factory, citing the urgent need for goods during the summer season and the workers' lack of intention to return to work, recruited thirty new workers to enter the factory and work, in order to resist the strike and maintain operations. The old workers, upon hearing this, gathered the entire workforce and waited in front of the factory gate to deal with the situation. The factory, upon learning of this, feared that an incident would occur, so it urgently telegraphed the police station, which immediately dispatched more than forty Chinese and foreign detectives to the factory to suppress the workers. At the same time, the police station dispatched more than one hundred Russian commercial corps members, armed with guns and ammunition, to surround the area and set up machine guns at the gate. Upon seeing this, the workers clashed with the detectives.

Workers Petition

Yesterday, all the old workers still did not resume work. The thirty new workers were strictly guarded by detectives as they entered the factory to work. At 10:00 AM, the old workers sent three representatives, Xu Xueqing, Zhao Jinyuan, and Sha Jinyu, to the head office on the Bund to petition the manager, Highcock. As a result, Highcock rejected all the conditions put forward by the workers. As the workers could not get their demands met, they decided to petition the General Labor Union and the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Party Department this morning (the 24th), seeking assistance and hoping for an early resolution.

### Disaster Relief Compilation

▲China Foreign Famine Relief Association

In view of the severity of the disaster situation in various provinces, the China Foreign Famine Relief Association believes that a large-scale disaster relief plan is necessary to save the disaster victims. Yesterday, it held a special executive committee meeting and decided to organize a planning committee to allocate various relief funds and review various specific disaster relief opinions. It is reported that the committee has now been established, with Zhang Nachuan and Finderlan as members, and has already begun reviewing plans from various parties to determine their suitability. It is reported that the association is currently in contact with the Ministry of Finance's Supervisory Office to simultaneously develop reclamation areas and build roads in Sichuan and Henan provinces, so as to provide relief to the disaster victims. In addition, the association's secretary, Baker, went to Sichuan to inspect the disaster situation. He is currently still in Chongqing and is expected to stay in Sichuan for two months to supervise the disaster victims and participate in road construction work.

In addition, since last summer, southern Shanxi has suffered from prolonged drought, and the people are displaced and unable to make a living. The Shanxi Provincial Government has sent a special telegram to the China Foreign Famine Relief Association for assistance (telegram text omitted).

▲Telegram from Chen Tiesheng

Chen Tiesheng, Deputy Director-General of the China Child Welfare Association, sent the following telegram from Zigong yesterday: To Xu, Director-General, and colleagues of the China Child Welfare Association, Museum Road, Shanghai. A large number of disaster-stricken children have gathered in the Fugong and Rong counties of southern Sichuan. Their situation is extremely pitiful. Miao Jianshuang, Director of the Sichuan Supervision Bureau, Wang Peiheng, Assistant, and Zheng Funan, Director of the Salt Field, have been devising methods to accommodate more than 200 children. This morning, Tiesheng accommodated seventeen disaster-stricken children who were about to starve to death in Dafengbao and raised nearly 4,000 yuan locally to jointly establish a shelter with this association. Telegram sent, Tiesheng.

▲Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Donate for Relief

The Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association recently received a letter from the Overseas Chinese Relief Association in Vietnam, stating that they had previously read reports about the severe drought disasters in Gansu, Sichuan, He, Nan, and Guizhou provinces of our country, with widespread suffering and many deaths. The news was extremely serious. The Kuang Lu Library Newspaper Agency and the Chinese Cloth Merchants Association in this port immediately convened a joint meeting and decided to organize the Overseas Chinese Relief Association in Vietnam and immediately start fundraising. The funds raised will be fully remitted to the Shanghai China Foreign Famine Relief Association for distribution. After the establishment of this association, it immediately requested the Chinese Consul stationed in Saigon to apply to the resident government for permission to raise funds for disaster relief, but approval has not been seen for many days, forcing them to proceed secretly, requesting some Chinese and Western philanthropists in the port to donate voluntarily. As of May 29th, they have raised 5,369.21 Vietnamese currency, equivalent to 8,000 yuan in national currency. Knowing that the disaster situation is urgent, like a spark, they remitted the full amount to the Shanghai China Foreign Famine Relief Association through the Saigon East Asia Bank on May 29th. They fully hope that the application will be approved as soon as possible, and they will continue to raise funds openly to provide continuous assistance to save the disaster victims. This special letter is sent to your association, requesting that it be published in various newspapers in Shanghai to show its credibility.

▲Scouts Scheduled to Fundraise

The Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Disaster Relief Association, in order to ask the city's Boy Scouts to collect public donations, specially issued a notice yesterday, stating that the drought disaster in Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces this year is extremely severe, affecting tens of millions of disaster victims and thousands of miles of land. The tragic situation has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers and is known to people from all walks of life. This association is coordinating relief efforts and making every effort to appeal for assistance. The central government has issued relief funds, and enthusiastic people have made generous donations, which have been remitted to the disaster-stricken provinces for relief. However, the disaster area is too wide, and relief is difficult. Telegrams have been received from various provinces stating that hundreds of millions of disaster victims are on the verge of death. Without continued relief, they will all perish. It is now scheduled for the 25th and 26th of this month to ask the entire city's Boy Scouts to mobilize and distribute flyers in the Public Concession to collect donations for relief. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate generously, no matter how much or little, according to their ability. Being able to donate even one more penny means saving one more life. On behalf of the disaster victims in various provinces, we implore you to grant your approval.

### Jiang Dingwen Flew to Shanghai Yesterday

Scheduled to Fly to Xun and Then to Lu Tomorrow Morning

Jiang Dingwen, Director of the Pacification Headquarters stationed in Fujian, was originally scheduled to fly from Fujian to Shanghai yesterday morning. However, due to bad weather, the plane was delayed. Therefore, it was not until 3:00 PM that he, along with Councilor Zhu Pingzhi and an adjutant, took a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Fujian to Shanghai. They arrived here at 5:40 PM that day, landing at Longhua Airport. Those who went to welcome him included the representative of Yang Huzi, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, Mrs. Jiang, and many relatives and friends of Jiang. After disembarking, Jiang went straight to his private residence on Anhe Temple Road to rest. It is scheduled that he will fly to Xun tomorrow (the 25th) and then to Lu to visit Committee Chairman Jiang. According to Jiang, he came here upon the telegraphic summons of Committee Chairman Jiang and is scheduled to fly to Xun and then to Lu on the 25th to visit Committee Chairman Jiang. He will stay in Lu for about three or four days and then return to Shanghai via Shanghai and then return to Fujian. Currently, there are still small groups of bandits in Fujian Province, and it is now decided to eliminate them within two or three weeks.

### Zhang Tielin and Others Initiate the Establishment of the China Timber Company

Head Office Set Up in Shanghai with an Office in Chongqing; Total Capital of Two Million Yuan, Half to Be Collected First; Dong Huaichang and Hu Junzhuang; General Manager He Beiheng; Sawmills and Timber Yards Established; Goods to Be Delivered by Next Spring

Zhang Jia'ao, Minister of Railways, was concerned that in recent years, foreign timber has been imported in large quantities, resulting in a huge drain on resources. In addition, with the active construction of railways, sleepers have always been supplied by foreign countries. If methods for self-sufficiency are not urgently sought, the loss of rights and interests will be endless. Therefore, last year, he specially dispatched expert Xia Songnian to Sichuan to investigate forests. Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry and Chairman Liu of the Sichuan Provincial Government also strongly advocated the forestry industry as an important industry in Sichuan Province.

Preparation Process

After the investigation, Xia Jun prepared a report on the Ebian Forest, believing that it has long-term logging value. In addition to supplying railway sleepers, a large amount of ordinary timber can also be produced. The Ministry of Railways believes that the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company has the mission of developing industries along the Sichuan Province line. This type of industry is actually related to the materials used for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Therefore, it instructed the company to work with the China Construction Bank and related parties to plan the management methods. For several months, the two companies have been working with the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Industry, the Sichuan Provincial Government, and the leaders of the Sichuan industrial sector to prepare for the establishment of the company. A preparatory committee was established first, and personnel were dispatched or local agencies were requested to handle the procurement of foreign machinery, the construction of highways from the forest area to the riverbank, and the selection of sites for timber yards and factories, in order to deliver goods in the spring of next year.

Formal Establishment

On the 21st of this month, the company was formally established at the Developers' Association at No. 181 Jiangxi Road in this port. The company name was determined to be China Timber Co., Ltd., and the company's articles of association were passed. Directors and supervisors were elected, and the first meeting of the board of directors was held to elect the chairman and standing directors and pass many important proposals. The company's share capital is a total of two million yuan. The Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Industry, and the Sichuan Provincial Government each subscribed for 200,000 yuan in shares to show their support. The China Construction Bank subscribed for 400,000 yuan in shares, the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company subscribed for 300,000 yuan in shares, and the Sichuan Industrial Bank subscribed for 700,000 yuan in shares. Half of them, one million yuan, has already been collected, and the remaining half is scheduled to be paid on August 15th.

Elected Directors and Supervisors

The names of the directors, supervisors, and general manager are as follows: Chairman of the Board: Hu Junzhuang; Standing Directors: Tan Xihong, Zhu Wenxiong, Liu Hangchen, Liu Jingshan; Directors: He Beiheng, Song Zi'an, Kang Xinru, Yang Cansan, Wu Shoutong, Xiang Jieren; Supervisors: Gan Jieyong, Fu Zuofu, Wei Wenhan, Zhou Jiansan, Qin Yingchun; General Manager: He Beiheng; Assistant Managers: Xiang Jieren, Hu Shuqian. The head office is located in Shanghai, with an office in Chongqing. Many important proposals were passed, including the methods for replanting and renewing forests after logging, which will also be handled in cooperation with the government's intentions. This large-scale timber company is a new creation in the country. Its future business prosperity can be foreseen, and it can add a different color to domestic timber.

### Fire on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei Kills and Injures More Than Ten People

Cause of the Fire Was an Exploding Gasoline Pot

At around 10:00 AM yesterday, in a tile bungalow at No. 1537 Jiaotong Road (west of Dayang Bridge) in Zhabei, a Shaoxing man named Xie Shouyu was running a steam oil factory. He only rented one side of the tile bungalow, and his work was all carried out in the open-air bamboo fence behind it. He employed an old chef named Li Dezhang, also from Shaoxing. For some unknown reason, the gasoline pot suddenly exploded. Li Dezhang was the first to bear the brunt, and his arms were blown off on the spot. His right arm was blown off at the shoulder, and his left arm was broken off at the lower arm. His whole body was burned, and his skin was broken and rotten. His eyeballs were also blown out, and blood and flesh flew everywhere, which was too horrible to look at. The surroundings of the area were all Jiangbei grass sheds, and sparks flew everywhere, spreading the fire to fifteen sheds. Fortunately, the Zhabei fire brigades rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and tried their best to put out the fire. They also brought ambulances to the scene to rescue the injured and send them to hospitals. According to the Zhabei Xinmin Road Pushan Hospital, Li Dezhang, whose arms were blown off, died immediately upon arrival at the hospital. His body is currently in the hospital's mortuary, awaiting inspection by the Shanghai Local Court today. It is currently unknown where the deceased's left and right arms are. His body was not wearing any clothes, as they were all burned off by the fire. Other injured people included Gao, an eight-year-old girl, who suffered burns to her head and neck; Liu Qiu, 38 years old, who suffered injuries to her face, hands, and feet; and Zhu Zhang, 34 years old, who suffered injuries to her hands and feet (all three were female). A man named Zhou Xiaode (male), 19 years old, injured his internal organs while fighting the fire. All of the above people (all of Jiangbei origin) were discharged from the hospital after being bandaged by Dr. Wu Guoqing. According to Han Baocheng, the local security officer of the 23rd district, there were still several people who were sent to the Renji Hospital in the concession and other hospitals. They were all slightly injured and discharged after being bandaged. There were about ten injured people in total. Luo Shiwei, a patrol officer from the Tanziwan Police Station, stated that the case investigation was complicated, so he had not yet filed a detailed report by evening.

### Three Italian Brothers Injured in Car Accident

Caused by Tire Blowout

Three Italian brothers, one of whom is an official at the Italian embassy, were riding in a car from Shanghai to Beijing along the highway yesterday. When the car was between Changshu and Wuxi, traveling at approximately 45 miles per hour, the front right tire suddenly blew out, causing the car to overturn into a ditch on the side of the road. The three Ross brothers suffered various injuries. One only suffered a few abrasions, one had a dislocated shoulder, and one had three broken ribs. The three lay in the ditch for some time until a freight car traveling from Beijing to Shanghai saw them and rescued them. They were helped into the car and taken to Shanghai after about four hours. The three are now being treated at the Country Hospital. Their car was completely destroyed and beyond repair and was abandoned in the ditch.

### Ten Ounces of Opium Seized on the Haiyan Steamer

### Beijing-Shanghai Pigeon Communication Competition

To Be Held in Mid-August

Since advocating the breeding of carrier pigeons, the Nanjing General Association of the China Pigeon Association has sought members from various places, and participation has been very active. The first phase, the long-distance pigeon communication between Beijing and Jiangxi, has been successfully completed and has become more popular nationwide. It is planned to establish branches in various places. In Shanghai, contact has been made with the Shanghai Pigeon Research Association, and the results have been very satisfactory. The association will be reorganized into the Shanghai Branch of the China Pigeon Association, and no separate organization will be established. As for the Beijing-Shanghai long-distance race, the Beijing and Shanghai associations are working separately, sending personnel to train pigeons every day. Recently, pigeons in Shanghai have flown back to this city from Changzhou. After two months of training, the Beijing-Shanghai flight can be successful. Therefore, this kind of competition must be held in mid-August.

### Retrial of Wang Xinggao, the Criminal in the Tang Jiapeng Assassination Case

Hearing Scheduled for Tomorrow Afternoon

Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing, was charged with instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, on June 18, 1933. After the case was discovered, the captured main culprit, Zhao Guangfu, reported it to the French Patrol Station, and Wang was arrested and sent to the Special Second Court, which sentenced him to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. After appealing, the Third Branch of the High Court reviewed the result, overturned the original verdict, and declared him not guilty. Within the appeal period, he was allowed to be released on bail for 20,000 yuan and a guarantor was always available. However, the French Police Department refused to accept this and requested the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court to file an appeal with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has already ruled to overturn the not-guilty verdict of the second instance and send the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for further investigation and trial. The reasons for the Supreme Court's judgment were that Wang had left home and no one had received the judgment. The document was handed over to the guarantor for forwarding. It is now learned that the case is currently being handled by Mr. Chen Daqi, who is responsible for the Third Branch of the High Court. After carefully reviewing the entire case file, he has scheduled a hearing for tomorrow (the 25th) afternoon and issued subpoenas in advance to inform Wang Xinggao and related witnesses. Many people will be present to observe at the time, and there will be another round of excitement.

### Trial Opens for the Assassination of Tang Youren Case, Two Defendants Appeal

Yesterday, the investigation was declared suspended. The two defendants repeatedly proclaimed their innocence in court.

In the case of the assassination of former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Youren, the perpetrators Liu Zhennan from Hubei Province and Sang Jiyu from Shaoxing, after repeated trials and investigations by Judge Liao Yilong of the Special Second Court's Criminal Division, were found guilty of repeated joint homicide and sentenced to death, with lifelong deprivation of their civil rights. Because the two defendants did not accept the verdict, they appealed to the High Third Branch Court. The details have been reported in this newspaper. While in custody in the detention center, the two defendants jointly selected lawyer Xu Heling as their defender and each submitted a written statement of reasons, approximately one thousand words in length, to the High Third Branch Court through lawyer Xu. The main points of the reasons were that after the incident, the bullet casings found by the police were verified to not have been fired from the handguns held by the two defendants. The initial trial judgment was based on coerced confessions obtained through torture by the police and entrapment by the Public Security Bureau. In reality, Tang Youren was not killed by them, and so on. Yesterday, the High Third Branch Court, through Judge Wang Yue of the Criminal Division, presided over the fifth court session, ordering the appellants Liu and Sang to be brought to court for investigation and trial. Defense lawyer Xu Heling also appeared in court on time. After questioning the two defendants about their acquaintance with Yang, Xiao, and others, as well as the circumstances of the plot to harm Tang Youren, the two defendants repeatedly proclaimed their innocence and denied the murder. Judge Wang reviewed the confessions and declared the investigation suspended, awaiting a scheduled retrial. The two defendants were ordered to be returned to the detention center.

### Three People Attempt Suicide by Drowning in the River, All Rescued

Mostly Due to Unemployment and Poverty

The day before yesterday afternoon, three men jumped into the Suzhou River and the Huangpu River, respectively, attempting suicide. Fortunately, all were rescued. The first, named He Rongchang, 26 years old from Shaoxing, jumped into the river from the Waibaidu Bridge around 5:00 PM. After being rescued by the water police, he confessed that he used to work as a waiter at the Jiangsu Hotel on Zhejiang Road and had been unemployed for a long time. The reason for his suicide was the loss of four pawn tickets, leading to excessive depression. The second, named Yan Chongming, 21 years old from Xiamen, jumped from a sampan at the Hongkou Merchants' Wharf around 7:00 PM. He was rescued by boatmen and sent to the water police station. He confessed that last spring, he obtained over a hundred yuan from his brother and came to Shanghai to seek a livelihood, but failed and ran out of money, leading him to resort to this desperate measure. The third, named Zhao Zihong, 55 years old from Shaoxing, jumped from the Waibaidu Bridge around 9:00 PM. He was rescued by the water police and confessed that he was lonely, impoverished, and plagued by illness, leaving him no choice but to take this drastic action. He mentioned having a nephew living near the North Station, among other things. The police chief dispatched detectives Xu Jielu and Jin Guifu, among others, to send them to their hometown associations and relatives for assistance.

### Yesterday Morning, Bandits Rented a Car to Kidnap a Nine-Year-Old Student

The Chauffeur Was Bound in a Remote Field in Zhabei During the Carjacking. The Kidnapped Boy is the Third Son of a Rich Rickshaw Merchant. The Car Was Found Empty Later That Day.

At the Yuning Automobile Company at the intersection of Yuqiaqing Road and Shantou Road in the Public Concession yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, three young men wearing long black silk robes and speaking with a Jiangbei accent suddenly arrived, stating that they needed to rent a car to pick up a guest on Binxing Road in Zhabei. They paid one yuan in advance. The company's chauffeur, Hua Yiheng, drove a Ford sedan with municipal license plate number 4533 and concession license number 18055. The three men got into the car, heading towards Zhabei. Unexpectedly, when the car reached a desolate area near the Siming Guild Hall on Binxing Road in northern Zhabei, the three young men suddenly pulled out handguns and forced the chauffeur out of the car, tying him to a bamboo fence with rope. The three bandits then got back into the car, drove it themselves, and parked it behind the First Special District Court on Rehe Road, lying in wait to kidnap a boy surnamed Lu. The Lu boy is the third and youngest son of the late Lu Changshun from Tongzhou, named Deming, who is only nine years old. Lu Changshun made his fortune by operating a rickshaw rental business, accumulating considerable wealth. The mansion at No. 74 Rehe Road was built by Lu himself. The eldest son, Lu Dexin, is the executive director and finance director of the Shanghai Rickshaw Guild and a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Ratepayers' Association. The second son, Lu Delin, is still studying. In 1937, the third son, Deming, is studying at the primary school attached to Nanyang Middle School on Kaifeng Road. Every day, he is escorted to and from school by a nanny. Yesterday morning at 7:45 AM, the nanny was escorting Deming to school as usual. Unexpectedly, just as they arrived at the school gate, the three bandits who had carjacked the vehicle rushed out from the side of the road, brandishing guns and threatening them. They pushed the nanny to the ground and helped Deming into the car, speeding north. The nanny witnessed the kidnapping of the young master and screamed and cried hysterically. At the same time, the Lu family heard the alarm and rushed to report to the Huishi Police Station, which had jurisdiction. The police immediately notified all bureaus of the concession and the municipal police to be on the lookout for the car used by the bandits. Meanwhile, the chauffeur, Hua Yiheng, who had been tied up in the remote field, was discovered by passersby and freed. Hua immediately reported to the Baziqiao Police Station, which had jurisdiction. It was learned that the carjacked vehicle was found yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the end of Binxing Road in Zhabei.

### Police Chief Commended for Protecting Against Robbery, Money House Rewards with Gratitude

On the morning of the 15th of this month, the old accountant of the Chunmao Money House on Doushi Street, Baolima Road, 16th P, carried a sum of 18,500 yuan to the bank. While passing Laobaidu Street, he was robbed by bandits. The police chief of the 16th P Branch, Lin Shao央, bravely recovered the full amount of stolen money. His bravery in fighting the bandits and protecting the victim was widely praised. The details were reported in previous news. It is now known that the Mao Money House expressed its gratitude to the 16th P Branch in a letter from Manager Ji Naoyang, attaching a reward to show his gratitude. The branch replied that protecting against violence and ensuring the safety of the people is the duty of the police and declined to accept the reward. However, the manager of the house insisted on giving the reward, so the branch is requesting instructions from the General Bureau to decide whether to refuse the reward.

### High Water Freight Rates and Few Routes, Foreign Timber Prices Rise

Foreign Pine Prices More Than Double; Construction Industry Suffers Severe Losses

Since the freight rates on Pacific routes have soared, all types of businesses in our country have been affected. The timber industry, due to the lack of goods from Russia and the United States in recent months, has seen prices skyrocket. Foreign pine has risen from six cents per foot to fourteen cents, an increase of more than double. Market prices continue to rise, making it impossible to suppress them. The construction industry has suffered significant losses. Negotiations have been held with major timber businesses, requesting the establishment of futures contracts for price fixing. The timber businesses have refused to agree. The Chamber of Commerce is currently acting as an intermediary. The timber used in the construction industry in this city is almost entirely supplied by Russia and the United States. Although our country produces pine, it has many knots and short trunks, making it unsuitable for construction. Fujian fir is too expensive, so there is no domestic timber that can replace it. If there are no more shipments from Russia and the United States, market prices will rise to the same level as during the European war.

### Cause of Death of British Woman Who Committed Suicide After Autopsy Still Unclear

Large Amount of Water in the Lungs of the Deceased; Stomach and Intestines Sent to the Public Works Bureau for Further Examination

Wu Yuanlong's wife, an Englishwoman (Kathleen Neary), also known as (Mary L. Wu), who had just married on January 1st of last year, suddenly arrived at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road at 11:30 PM on the 17th of this month and booked room 112. The next day at noon, the tea boy Zhang Chunlin discovered her lying stiff in the bathtub. He immediately reported it to the police, who sent her to the Public Qing Hospital. Resuscitation was ineffective, and she died. The police found a bottle containing one hundred sleeping pills in her purse, but only ninety-six sleeping pills remained. After the body was examined by the prosecutor assigned by the Special First Court, it was determined that the cause of death, whether suicide by poisoning or suffocation, required an autopsy. It is now known that the body was autopsied by forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan. The cause of death is still difficult to determine because there was a large amount of water in the deceased's lungs. Therefore, the stomach and intestines, and other related parts, have been sent to the Public Works Bureau Chemical Examination Office for chemical examination, after which the cause of death can be determined. The court is currently awaiting the chemical examination report from the Public Works Bureau.

Sentenced to One Year and Six Months; Granted a Five-Year Suspended Sentence

Liu Songkun, a Cantonese man residing at No. 104 Chunyangli, Dongyouheng Road, 25 years old, graduated from St. Francis College.

Wang Miaohong was acquitted and released.

### Judge Brings Robbers and Murderers to the Scene to Reenact the Crime

Complex Case Involving Two Groups of Bandits; Seeking the Truth to Avoid Wrongful Convictions

The case of the burglary and murder of Chen Tingzhang, a wealthy resident of No. 187 Yangjiazhai Road, Bei Dong, on the morning of May 4th of this year, was investigated by the Lao Zha Police Station of the Public Concession. Five suspects were arrested: Zhang Pingjiang, Chen Zhenghe, Chi Tiemin, Zhao Juzhen, and Xie Jindi. On the afternoon of the 19th, four more suspects were arrested: Wang Dian from Jiangbei, Wang Amao from Anhui, Jia Youyi from Zhenjiang, and Li Jinsheng from Hubei. They were escorted to the First Special Court. The court learned that the two groups of bandits arrested at different times did not know each other.

### Occasional Mistaken Receipt of Stolen Goods Invariably Results in Illegal Extortion by Detectives

Jade Jewelers Association Yesterday Requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Devise a Method to Stop It; Hope to Handle It According to the Silverware Industry's Practice of Accepting and Selling Goods

The Shanghai Jade Jewelers Association, because its members often mistakenly receive stolen goods, resulting in illegal extortion by detectives, specially submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which was forwarded to the Superior Bureau, requesting that the industry be governed by the same regulations as the silverware industry: old goods received for exchange should be retained for ten days, specifically awaiting notification from the police authorities. If the goods are stolen, the owner can prepare a receipt and take them back. After the deadline, no responsibility will be assumed, to demonstrate fairness and understand the merchants' difficulties. The submission stated: "The members of our association operate jade jewelry businesses, with exchange as the main principle. Inner stores and market shops pay full attention to the source of goods, as notified by the association. Imported goods such as jadeite and diamonds are rejected if taxes have not been paid. However, for old items owned by private individuals circulating in the market, transactions can be completed immediately as long as the price is reasonable. Inevitably, stolen goods are mistakenly received. However, the authorities, especially the detectives in the concession, often do not distinguish between right and wrong, and arbitrarily investigate, using pretexts to extort with fierce expressions that are incomprehensible, or slightly defend themselves with explanations, only to be blamed and insulted, even implicating thieves and abusing cruel punishments. This is unbearable. Although our association has repeatedly appealed, it has not been improved. Merchants seek profit with capital, how can illegal burdens be wrongly added? As for whether an item is stolen, how can one predict? Especially the faces of thieves, how can one distinguish them? Moreover, selling stolen goods does not necessarily mean being a real thief, and mistakenly receiving stolen goods is not intentional. Whose fault should it be? It is very clear. Today is an era of judicial enlightenment, how can such illegal shackles exist? The members of our association have suffered hidden pain, even resentment. We dare to request that the industry be governed by the same regulations as the silverware industry: old goods received for exchange should be retained for ten days, specifically awaiting notification from the police authorities. If the goods are lost or stolen, the owner can prepare a receipt and take them back. After the deadline, no responsibility will be assumed, to demonstrate fairness and understand the merchants' difficulties."

### Dispute Arises Over Land Enclosure at the Airport

Hundreds of Villagers Surround Bureau Officials; Patrol Officer Goes to Persuade Them to Disperse

The Eurasia Aviation Company at the Longhua Airport in this city recently wanted to expand the airport and enclose hundreds of acres of farmland in the Li Family Residence, Tang Family Residence, Xu Family Residence, and other places. When the landlords learned of this, they became very alarmed. They elected Hong Songying of the Flower and Tree Association, Gan Lixian of the Fresh Medicine Industry, and villagers Tang Rongtao and Shen Jinxiang as representatives. They appealed and petitioned to various ministries of the National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government to cancel the order and avoid the suffering of residents being forced to relocate. However, yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Yu Chubai of the Public Works Bureau and Ye Wenan of the Land Administration Bureau, accompanied by surveyors, went to the countryside to notify Zhu Kang, the local Baojia of the thirteenth village, to lead them to measure houses and erect wooden stakes. Zhu initially did not go, but eventually went after a delay. The officials had just finished measuring the flower sheds of Gao Guanfu and Gao Lianbao when hundreds of villagers, old and young, male and female, came out to stop them, pulling out the stakes and trying to surround and scold the officials. Fortunately, they were discovered and escaped into the airport office, where they were able to resolve the measurement. The local Baojia also fled. However, the villagers believed that the Public Works Bureau suddenly came to set up stakes and the Baojia did not stop them, believing that he had been instructed to do so. Therefore, everyone gathered at the residence of the 134th Baojia for discussion. The voices were loud and chaotic, and the order was disrupted. Women even smashed tables and scolded, causing trouble. The local police officer Song learned of this and, fearing a catastrophe, led the police to persuade them to disperse.

### 153rd Batch of Expelled Overseas Chinese Repatriated

Zheng Hongji and Nine Others

The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau announced that the 153rd batch of repatriated overseas Chinese arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese Zhudu Maru the day before yesterday.

### Shanghai County Government Issues Notice Limiting Time for Land Price Verification

From the 23rd to the 28th; Correct After Payment

The Shanghai County Government issued a notice to all districts yesterday, stating: "In the case submitted by Xing Zhigang, the district chief of the fifth district of our county, regarding the second phase of land price tax for this year, due to the modification of the tax amount, there are discrepancies between the mu and fen listed on the notification and the tax amount, causing doubts among the owners. Moreover, the collection point is far from the county, making it difficult to correct and pay the tax, which affects tax revenues. Furthermore, the deadline for tax payment is approaching. The district chief, in order to ensure national tax revenue and protect property rights, cannot bear to let the landowners miss the opportunity. Therefore, he sincerely requests that the Land Bureau and the Food and Taxation Office send staff to the district with books to notify the owners to complete tax payment within one week, so that all doubts can be quickly and thoroughly addressed, for the convenience of both officials and the people. The sentiment is touching." According to the investigation, the second phase of land price tax for this year has been collected since May 1st of this year, for more than a month. The collection amount has not yet increased. Although it is a busy farming season, it is not without influence. However, the fact that the owners do not understand the method of calculating the modified tax amount, resulting in doubts and thus fatigue, is also one of the reasons for the tax revenue shortfall. In order to enrich the tax and care for the people, and to consider both aspects, it is appropriate to approve the district chief's proposal to send staff to the district with books so that the owners can verify their taxes nearby. The Land Bureau and the Food and Taxation Collection Office will select cadres to bring the forms and reside at the first, second, and fifth district offices from the 23rd to the 28th of this month to handle the verification procedures. The first district will still be handled at the County Land Bureau, and the fourth district will be handled at the Sanlin branch office. A joint announcement is hereby made. All owners are requested to take note that if they have doubts about the modified tax amount and mu fen of the second phase of land price tax, they should go to the designated locations for verification as soon as possible. The government will then correct the discrepancies. The tax payment must still be made by the owners themselves. The deadline is approaching, so please pay enthusiastically. Do not wait and delay. This is a special announcement."

### Philips Comprador Shu Chengrong Embezzlement Trial

Defendant States Reasons for Debt; Not Entirely Due to Personal Misappropriation

Shu Chengrong, the comprador for the Shanghai Philips Company on Sichuan Road, a native of Ningbo, embezzled more than 100,000 yuan from the company in 1932 and fled without a trace. The company reported the theft to the police, who requested an arrest warrant from the First Special Court. After five years, Shu Chengrong was arrested by detectives Shangwu and Zhao Ziduo of the Huishi Police Station and escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin continued the trial in the eighth criminal court. The public prosecutor was raised and stated that after investigation, it was found that the defendant had successively embezzled a total of 110,366 yuan and 96 cents from the company. After deducting 6,061 yuan and 44 cents compensated by his guarantor, the five electrical companies, and deducting his commission of 20,101 yuan and 75 cents, he still owed the company 76,023 yuan and 76 cents. The prosecutor requested questioning of the defendant. The defendant confessed to the amount stated by the police, but stated that 20,000 yuan was owed by his predecessor, and approximately 30,000 yuan was owed by customers such as Mingda, Fulai, Ruiji, and Kangji. The accountant, surnamed Ni, owed approximately 15,000 yuan, and the warehouse was stolen of light bulbs worth 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Therefore, the deficit was accumulated over time. The defendant's defense lawyer, Yu Xiangqin, stated that the defendant's brother, Shu Chengde, was the comprador for the Lida Company and was responsible for the sales of Philips electrical products. He was highly successful. Philips established a company in Shanghai and appointed Chengde as comprador. In 1927, Chengde died, and the defendant took over the position. The following year, he signed a contract with the company, stating that all customer accounts were managed by the defendant, but the defendant was also fully responsible for any deficits. In this situation, the case is not a criminal matter. The contract is currently kept at lawyer Zhan Jiyin's office and should be investigated. The judge stated that the case still required investigation and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody to await a retrial and further investigation.

### Dense Fog Lingers Along China's Coast

Ships and Aircraft Affected

According to reports from ships and aircraft traveling along the Chinese coast, as reported by the North-China Daily News, the fog along the coast has been unusually dense for the past ten days, causing delays in arrival. The fog is moving slowly, and yesterday's (22nd) weather was the result of a low-pressure system approaching Shanghai. Pilots of the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangzhou flights were often forced to fly at altitudes higher than usual to maintain clear visibility. According to Father Gherzi, director of the Xujiahui Observatory, dense fog is common along the Chinese coast in June and is not unusual. However, this year, several low-pressure areas have moved eastward from southern China. The southeast and southwest already experience foggy weather in the summer, and the addition of this low pressure has caused the dense fog to linger along the Chinese coast, hindering shipping. When the low pressure passes, it leaves tropical air along the coast. The cold air from Siberia then begins to descend and condense, often resulting in rain and increased fog. Then another low pressure arrives, causing the fog along the coast to become pervasive and lack clarity.

### Wife Sues for Separation Due to Husband's Favored Concubine

Requests a Lump Sum for Alimony; Court Mediation Results in Reconciliation

Chai Zhaochang (age 32, from Ningbo), owner of the Yongfengnan timber business at the Jiuda wharf in Nanshi, is a wealthy man with two timber businesses. Ten years ago, he married Chai Wang Yinge (currently age 17), who bore him a son, now nine years old. The couple's relationship had never been fractured. However, seven years ago, Chai Zhaochang took "Xiumei" as a concubine, rotating between the two women without incident. Chai Wang Yinge, feeling neglected due to her husband's favoritism and lacking personal savings, hired lawyer Zhang Yaoming to petition the District Court to order a separation from her husband and to grant a lump sum of 3,900 yuan for alimony. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Zhijiu presided over the hearing. The defendant claimed he cherished his wife and did not want a separation. The judge then advised the plaintiff that once a couple separates, it would be difficult to reconcile in the future. If she was concerned about lacking savings, the defendant could pay her a monthly allowance. Consequently, the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff a monthly allowance of 22 yuan, with the defendant responsible for all expenses related to the child. The couple reconciled and agreed to be on good terms.

### Calculation Methods for China's Salt Administration Statistics (3)

Zhang Xinglian, Statistics Director of the Salt Administration

(Also Responding to Shi Guojun's "The Crisis of China's Salt Tax")

② Shi Lianjun states, "The Salt Administration claims that salt tax revenue in the 25th year (1936) increased to 200.5 million yuan, which differs significantly from the facts. In the 25th year, the Ever-Normal Salt system was used, pre-collecting 58 million yuan in taxes for the 26th and 27th years. Therefore, the actual revenue in the 25th year was only 147 million yuan, a decrease of 38.9 million yuan compared to the 185.9 million yuan in the 24th year." The method of calculating the pre-collected salt tax incorrectly assumes that the salt tax from the Yangzi River (揚子) and the four coastal areas (四岸) is uniformly 10.4 yuan per dan. It is important to know that 10.4 yuan is the highest tax rate in that area, and only about 57% of the salt released in the 25th year was taxed at 10.4 yuan per dan; the remaining 43% were taxed at rates below 10 yuan. This is the first error. The coastal surtax (岸附稅) on Huai salt (淮監) along the Yangzi River and the four coastal areas is not levied upon arrival but only upon release. Including the coastal surtax in the calculation is the second error. Whether it is a pooled salt (滙監) or refined salt (精鹽), the Ever-Normal Salt is not permanently stored without sale. In fact, a portion has already been released to the market, and the taxes paid on the released portion should not be considered pre-collected taxes and deducted. This is the third error. To investigate whether the initial statistics of 205,433,000 yuan for salt tax revenue in the 25th year include pre-collected taxes, a theoretical calculation can be made. The amount of salt released in the 25th year in various regions (based on the salt release permits) is multiplied by the actual tax rate, yielding the theoretical salt tax revenue for the 25th year. Although the theoretical tax revenue differs from the actual revenue, pre-collected taxes are not included. The calculation method is as follows:

Number of Salt Dans × Tax Rate = Tax Revenue

Example: Changlu 1,294,482 × 8.133 = 10,528,022

1,076,628 × 7.633 = 8,217,901

Using this method, the result is over 200.87 million yuan (excluding taxes on marine salt (漁監), industrial salt (工業用監), by-products, and exported salt), which is higher than the initial statistics. Shi Lianjun's incorrect calculation of the Ever-Normal Salt method proves the inaccuracy.

In conclusion, the arguments in "The Crisis of China's Salt Tax" represent the author's personal opinions and can be disregarded. However, they influence public perception and often lead to the spread of misinformation. For example, in an article titled "Relief and Assistance for the Salt Industry During Extraordinary Times" published in the Dagongbao (大公報) on the 17th of this month, Jianmi (監迷) states, "Last year, the Ever-Normal Salt was implemented twice, essentially pre-spending salt taxes..." This is an incorrect assertion based on Shi Lianjun's argument. Jianmi, who has studied salt administration for years, still falls into this trap. Therefore, the error in the cited statistical material ultimately causes the argument to lose its correct value. Given the significant implications, it is necessary to correct this. (End)

### The Underground Tinder

— Zilan

Not long ago, I saw a documentary called "Spain in Flames". One segment showed the people of Madrid rising up to build fortifications after the city was brutally bombed by the rebels. Among these people were many children, resolutely wielding pickaxes to dig trenches and carry bricks. For some reason, this brief scene of shared hatred and determination deeply moved me.

Now, we see the news that the port of Bilbao, held by the Spanish government forces for eighty-one days, has finally fallen to the rebels. The importance of the port of Bilbao and the reasons for its fall were discussed in detail in this newspaper's commentary on the 21st. Mr. Fu (輔) concluded by telling us that "the government forces will still have to go through a very arduous struggle to achieve the final victory: but this final victory will always belong to the people's government of Spain. Because any party that violates the will of the people and uses external force to seize power is bound to fail one day."

This conclusion is absolutely certain. Franco's "using external force to seize power" has not only aroused the anger of the Spanish people and the world's defenders of justice, but this anger has also taken root in the next generation. A Havas (哈瓦斯) dispatch from London on the 20th of this month reported:

"Recently, a group of five hundred Spanish children arrived in England from the city of Bilbao for refuge. They were received in the town of Northeast Stoneham (東北斯東漢鎮), where they were allowed to listen to radio messages from their hometown every night to soothe their homesickness: but when the news of the fall of Bilbao came out last night, the children were frightened and cried out, their concern for their country being truly rare! Ordinarily, if anyone mentions the name of Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, or Mussolini, the Italian Prime Minister, the children would respond by punching and kicking."

Children are innocent, and their likes and dislikes are completely reflected in their personal experiences: they have experienced the "benevolence" of Franco and his puppeteers, so they will naturally not forget the "benefits" of Franco and his puppeteers. "Punching and kicking" is only natural. Now, although they have taken refuge in England, they cannot but care about those who have experienced "benevolence" and their troubled motherland. "The news of the fall of Bilbao made many of the children feel that they must return home to help their parents and relatives" (see the Reuters dispatch of the day). This is enough to show that "justice resides in people's hearts", and it does not discriminate between old and young, male and female.

"The fall of Bilbao is certainly unfavorable to the position of the Spanish government forces," but regardless of whether "the second reason for the defeat no longer exists", even if Franco and his puppeteers gain some advantage in the near future, the people will continue to strike at the "party that violates the will of the people and uses external force to seize power", which is still inevitable. This tinder is not only buried underground, but also buried in the underground of the next generation.

As long as there is tinder, the fire will not go out! We will be optimistic about the final victory of the Spanish government forces.

### Secluded Alley

— Lu Jia

The secluded alley appears mysterious in the eyes of the townspeople due to the residence of foreign expatriates.

It is unknown when these foreigners, speaking different languages and wearing different clothes, arrived at this small town by train. They bought houses located in this dead-end alley from a bankrupt household at a high price that the residents were unwilling to pay, and then settled down. These expatriates with their mysterious whereabouts brought anxiety and fear to the residents because, according to their shallow knowledge, they were well aware that people from this country were forever associated with danger and evil. They would disrupt the town's decades of stagnant tranquility, and even cause damage to their property and lives.

Therefore, no one dared to look into this alleyway. Adults quietly warned their children. When meeting on the street, they exchanged the usual greetings and then exchanged rumors or speculations about these intruders. The entire town was like a boiling pot thrown into private deliberation, anxious and uneasy; and this alleyway appeared more calm, lonely, and secluded amidst the residents' invisible vigilance.

The expatriates hung a plaster-shaped flag with a white background and a red heart on the roof. To show that they had a fixed occupation, they also hung a wooden sign at the entrance of the alley: ×× Foreign Firm, Pharmaceutical and General Merchandise Merchant. But this only increased the residents' doubts, because there was not a single item of merchandise displayed in the simple display window, and the thick white paper on the glass of the wooden sliding door blocked the view from outside. This was in line with a local saying: "Who knows what medicine they are selling in their gourd." Sometimes, these expatriates left their residences and strolled leisurely on the town's narrow streets. Adults and children walked freely, gesticulating and laughing. The residents stared at the passersby with wary eyes, while holding their children tightly in front of them. In their hearts, they questioned their true occupation, their intentions, and their lives.

As time gradually passed, the alleyway remained as desolate as when they first arrived. This dead-end alley was located in a relatively quiet corner of the town, with only one exit leading to the street. And there were only one or two households in the short, narrow alley, so it could be said that the alley belonged to them. The rooftops were low, the walls were dilapidated, and the doors and windows were sealed with dust and sand. There was a pile of garbage at the entrance of the alley, as well as a puddle of greasy, stagnant water, covered with flies and insects. Everything was damp and calm, and only a flag faded to a yellowish brown was flying in the wind with a musty smell on the roof. If it weren't for the smoke rising along the rooftops in the morning and evening, it would really make people wonder if the house had been uninhabited for many years. The faded characters on the sign could still be vaguely recognized as a few clumsy ink characters: ×× Foreign Firm, Pharmaceutical and General Merchandise Merchant.

The secluded alley, like a trap, opened its insidious mouth in a place unknown to the simple residents, wanting to send the entire town into an immeasurable fate when the residents were unaware. But now, it was a mystery to the residents, an unsolvable mystery.

### Fishing Village

— Guan Yinxi

After several days of trekking and repeated fatigue, I finally arrived at this well-known fishing village.

Taking advantage of the natural environment, the village grew very beautifully. In front was a vast expanse of sea, and behind it was a large plain. Far away behind the plain was a cluster of lush green peaks. It was inhabited by about three thousand fishing households, with a population of more than ten thousand people. From the town to here, there was only a stone slab bridge built on a deep water field that could be used to pass. Due to traditional habits, the fishermen often broke the stone bridge to resist the官軍 (Official Army) from coming in to collect taxes. In other words, the power here did not belong to the government, but to another group of people.

The intrusion of these people made the village prosperous, but also made the village rot. On that only street, which was more than a mile long, there were quite a few modern cement buildings. One three-story building in the style of a memorial arch was the headquarters of these people. "Shangtian Fisheries Association." The ledgers in the association recorded the fates of the more than ten thousand fishermen, both happy and sad. Usually, they generously loaned money to the fishermen, and when the fishing season came, they had to hand over all the fish they caught to them to clear their old debts and borrow new debts. The association classified the fish and sent them to ice rooms on electric boats to be taken to the city to be sold.

The Fisheries Association openly had more than a dozen daily necessities stores scattered on the street, and secretly displayed opium dens, gambling houses, and brothels. The fishermen received money from the association's accounting office with trembling hands, and immediately handed it over to the hands of the people in charge of the daily necessities combination, opium dens, gambling houses, and brothels. The inflow and outflow and exchange of their money was just a formal change, just a cycle; the association was like the lungs, the money was like the blood, and the people were like the functional tissues in the human body. Blood starts from the lungs. After passing through the various functional tissues, it returns to the lungs.

Although the annual fishing season brought happiness and joy to the fishermen, it also brought them weakness, disease, death, and tears. They got fish from the sea, exchanged it for money at the association: but they also got opium addiction, smoking addiction, and morphine addiction at the opium den; they got gambling debts at the gambling house: they got venereal disease in the brothel, and they got tears in front of their families, wives and children, and parents. As a result, the brave youth became weak and old, while middle-aged and old people swam in death and pain.

Poverty and death spread quickly in this village, but they did not understand the real reason. The elderly unanimously sighed that the feng shui of their ancestors had changed, and the world was getting worse day by day.

At night, we strolled leisurely on the street. A small generator made the whole street bright and brilliant. Obscene songs, the sharp laughter of prostitutes, the drunken shouts of drunkards, intertwined with the sighs and resentment thrown out from the fishermen's cottages, and reverberated in the clear sky.

"The end of this village is near!" A missionary friend told me, shaking his head. He had moved here from the town because he received a subsidy of fifty yuan a month from the association. "All the people in the village have lost their humanity..."

"When there is no association for you to take a subsidy from, they can regain their humanity." I replied to him half jokingly and half seriously. "Your God is being used in the same way as their opium, Taiwanese prostitutes, don't you believe it? Think carefully..."

When I reached the end of the street, I didn't hear a word from him, and the faint light shone on his half-somber face.

### In the Prison Van

— Sen Shan

Time is the most capable of grinding down a person's arrogance. More than three months of prison life had already weakened my irritable nature considerably. The day I was awaiting for the sentencing finally arrived. The prison warden's rough roll call sounded like a whip lashing around my body. The human mind is the most contradictory thing; now I simply wanted to overturn my previous expectations and was unwilling to go to court to hear the sentencing.

From the pigeon-cage-like prison, I walked into the pigeon-cage-like prison van. (There were a total of eight of us.) The vibration of the engine gave us an indescribable stimulus, and our brains suddenly became sensitive because in the static, gray life, we rarely had access to even this small vibration. The iron gate, which had once swallowed us, now spat us out again. The prison van was already driving on the road.

It was just like a group of blind people who had been blind for a long time suddenly being able to open their eyes and see everything! Shops, food, people walking freely, replaced the lifeless, colorless iron bars, walls, and shackles. At this time, I even became jealous of the beggars begging for food along the street; "The true meaning of freedom is only clearly understood by those who have experienced prison life how to interpret it."

In prison, the things that made us happiest besides eating were talking about women. -- But now they exceeded the position of food. As soon as they caught our eye, they captured our entire focus, and even the colorful and once coveted noble foods were discarded without hesitation. Old Chen, like a hungry eagle, with a terrifying smiling light in his eyes, leaned his elbow on my arm: "Hey, woman, how beautifully her hips sway." Such behavior is not at all surprising in prisoners. No matter how reserved or proud of their rationality people are, living in this gloomy, completely isolated gray atmosphere, over time, their brilliant outer garments will slowly be damaged and eventually be stripped naked. At first, I thought this kind of person was too crude and unpleasant, but later I realized that it was the true face revealed after tearing off the mask. People must be in this place where there is no competition for fame and fortune, and under the extreme pressure of sexual desire and hunger, to show their most primitive appearance.

When we re-entered the prison van after the sentencing, there were only four of us left. -- The four were declared innocent and released. -- The car seemed emptier and more desolate than when we arrived. Old Chen began to speak with a bitter smile:

"Little Li, take another look, at this living road, the clear sky, especially the women like twisted candy. Once you go in this time, you won't be out of the iron gate for another two years, and I have one year and six months more than you."

That eighteen-year-old child—Jialin, with tears filling his eyes, his lips and nose twitching slightly: "Damn it, what law did I break to be sentenced to four years?" Old Tang, who had been silently watching, unexpectedly stopped his voice, patting him on the back and saying, "Little Zhang, what's the use of being angry? Didn't the four acquitted companions also sit for four months? What can we say who are guilty?"

The prison van quickly drove into the two huge iron gates that caused headaches just by looking at them, and the iron gates heavily dropped behind the car.

"I won't be able to go out again for another year." I silently whispered to the iron gate.

### Firefly

— Lin Jia

In the summer night's breeze, a firefly spreads its tulle-like small wings, flies over the vast and silent thatched huts, and uses a speck of dark green light to illuminate the dark and leafy jungle, glides over the valleys crisscrossed with jagged rocks, and descends onto the lush green tombstones, where it crawls, blinking on and off, as if it has lost something, patiently and tirelessly searching every grave.

When I was a child, by the pond, in the dense aquatic plants, or sitting on the bow of a small fishing boat parked between moonlight and water shadows, I quietly listened to the clicking sounds of the mussels and gazed at the swarm of fireflies that gathered and scattered and glowed on the water's surface. In the hazy atmosphere, it was as if countless small torches were floating restlessly, but in an instant, they disappeared into the black sea of night like a plate of golden specks flying down from the sky, mysteriously using their faint firelight to struggle against the heavy darkness, I loved their courage, and I cursed the night for greedily extinguishing that glimmer of light.

I heard a story about fireflies:

A firefly is a girl who loves freedom and light. She and her lover—a person who sank into the sea for the freedom of the entire universe—step by step plant flowers of freedom on the desolate earth. When he buries a fruit of freedom in the field, the firefly uses her lamp that breaks through the darkness to shine on the tender shoots. When this flower is strong, her lover has already planted another one in the front. They work tirelessly, not afraid of the thorns and jackals in the wilderness, in order to make the world blow the wind of peace and taste the fruit of love that falls from the freedom flowers. They persistently walk the road that no one has walked.

They forget winter and summer in the endless hard years. On a winter evening of fierce winds and heavy snow, the firefly's lover alone steered a wooden raft across the black, wave-filled Demon Sea. When the firefly shined the seeds she planted on this side of the sea to grow out of the ground and looked for her lover, the sky was already night. The sea was churning with huge waves, and her lover was gone. She shone her light, flying non-stop in the dark night, calling with her throat, but her voice was hoarse, and her lover did not answer. From then on, she gave up hope, and she radiated light on the young seedlings that had sprouted, hoping that they would grow strong. However, on the road she travelled, she often found a patch of bright red blood under the bright freedom flowers, and a pile of rotting bones. Many years later, a martyrs' tomb was erected there, and the freedom flowers she planted had been buried. In the dark night, she cannot forget her lover who pursued freedom. In commemoration, she spreads her small wings and looks for the red flowers.

The flowers are buried in the soil with the blood of the martyrs, the night is still thick, still quiet, under the dim shadows of the night, countless fireflies are scattered...
