### Chahar Northern Self-Defense Army Attacks Zhaoyang Town, South of Jiabusi

Engaged in Fierce Battles with Bandits and Puppets. Temporarily Retreating Due to Numerical Disadvantage. After Wang Ying's Troops Fled, Most Joined the Righteous Army

[Beiping] Zhangjiakou Telegram: Prince De is still residing in Jiabusi, and the situation in Gaodu is extremely chaotic. The Chahar Northern People's Self-Defense Army has repeatedly attacked Zhaoyang Town, 20 miles south of Jiabusi, and made contact with the 8th Division of the puppet Inner Mongolian Army, commanded by Bao Haiwu, and the 3rd Division, commanded by Wang Zhenhua. Wang's Song Regiment suffered considerable losses, but the Self-Defense Army eventually retreated due to numerical disadvantage. Prince De has been personally urging the artillery team, commanded by Ding Qichang, to defend Zhaoyang Town and Dehua.

It is also learned that the Yang Shouchang and Zhang Wanqing units of Wang Ying's troops, because their leaders were arrested and fled, have mostly joined the Chahar Northern People's Self-Defense Army.

Standing Committee member Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. After leading the attendees to pay their respects, Ye reported on the internal work of the Central Party Department. The ceremony concluded at 9:30 AM. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The National Government held its Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the 14th. Chairman Lin, Deng Jiayan, and other members and staff members of the National Government and various ministries, departments, and committees, totaling about 400 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the attendees to pay their respects, he reported that "Disaster relief is a national responsibility." The ceremony concluded at 10:30 AM. Chairman Lin's original report was as follows: "Some time ago, we often saw documents and reports on the disaster situation in various places in official documents and newspapers. This time, the disaster situation is very serious, whether in terms of the affected area or the number of people affected and the degree of suffering. Such a major event will inevitably have a great impact on our process of national salvation and national construction. Although the disaster areas have recently received rain and the government has issued large amounts of relief funds, the disaster situation has been considerably alleviated. However, in order to plan for the aftermath and think ahead, we should pay close attention to the course of this disaster. So today, I will raise this issue again for discussion. We must first understand the actual situation of this drought. According to various reports and newspaper records, it can be roughly divided into two aspects. First, the affected area. Provinces and regions that have reported being affected include Ningxia, Sichuan, Henan, Guizhou, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Guangxi, and other provinces. So this disaster is almost all over the southwest and northwest regions of our country, which cannot be said to be very extensive. Among these provinces, Sichuan is the most severely affected. According to reports, 126 of the 149 counties in Sichuan Province have been affected, including 11 counties that are the most severely affected, 34 counties that are moderately affected, 51 counties that are less severely affected, and 30 counties for which the level has not been determined. The second is Henan Province, which has 103 counties, of which 93 have been affected, including 27 counties that are the most severely affected, 34 counties that are moderately affected, and 32 counties that are less severely affected. Second, the number of people affected. We can also take Sichuan and Henan provinces as examples. There are more than 35 million disaster victims in Sichuan, and the total population of the province is about 70 million, with the number of disaster victims accounting for half of the province's population. Furthermore, Henan Province has about 32 million people, with more than 9 million disaster victims. In addition, the number of disaster victims in other provinces has not yet been calculated. Just from this point, we can imagine the severity of the disaster situation in various places. Third, the degree of suffering. For this point, we only need to look at the food of the disaster victims in various places to know what their suffering is like. In areas that are more severely affected, the disaster victims could initially use tree bark and grass to fill their stomachs. Later, when the tree bark and grass roots were exhausted, they dug up and ate a kind of sticky mud, which they call Guanyin mud or Xianmi. Eating this kind of soil causes indigestion, and they become swollen and soon lose their lives. This situation exists in both Sichuan and Henan. What I have mentioned above is only a general picture of the disaster situation in various places. What impact does this disaster have on our country and nation? Simply put, our country and nation are now on the road to revival. Such a serious disaster will naturally create obstacles to our revival work. First, in terms of the national economy, the foundation of our national economy is still built on the countryside. Now that the rural economy in the above-mentioned areas has been severely damaged due to the disaster, the result will naturally affect the entire national economy. In terms of national prosperity, a nation must be able to survive and prosper in the world by ensuring that every member of the nation has adequate living opportunities and a sound physique. With adequate living opportunities and a sound physique, they can then fight for the survival of their nation. Otherwise, if everyone is struggling on the verge of starvation and death, how can they have the spare time and energy to contribute to their nation? Now that there are so many disaster victims in our country, this is naturally a great regret for our national future. Furthermore, in terms of social and political order, social and political stability requires that people be well-fed and well-clothed. This is a certain truth. Now that there are so many people who cannot obtain the minimum means of survival, it is inevitable that the social and political order will be affected. We cannot but pay attention to this point. Now that the disaster situation is so serious throughout the country and its impact is so great, we must do our best to carry out disaster relief. Fortunately, most of the disaster areas have recently received rain, and the disaster situation has been considerably alleviated. Furthermore, the government has issued relief funds, which are now being distributed, and the disaster victims also have hope. I believe that this issue will not be so serious again in the future. However, because of the wide area of the disaster, the large number of disaster victims, and the limited relief funds of the government, it may be difficult to provide universal relief. Therefore, we still cannot but hope that all parties in the country will unite to assist the government in carrying out disaster relief together. Furthermore, in addition to treating the symptoms of disaster relief, we should also think about how to prevent such a disaster from happening again in the future. This is something that deserves our attention. I hope that all sectors of society in the country will work together. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Thoughts on the Tenth Anniversary of the Shanghai Machinery Industry Association

— Chui

The Shanghai Machinery Made National Goods Factories Association is holding its tenth anniversary celebration today. The association is a highly significant group in the area of national goods production. The number of national goods industries it encompasses has increased from 45 to 57. Its future development has no endpoint. On the occasion of this memorial, I would like to offer a few words as a celebration for the association.

1.  Our country's backwardness in production is undeniable. And the aggressive dumping of imported goods is also an undeniable fact. Under these circumstances, the country's social economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Only by actively promoting production on one hand and strictly implementing the motto of "Chinese people buying Chinese goods" on the other can the crisis be averted. Mr. Wu Zhihui's so-called "not buying things" is indeed a noteworthy saying. And the mission of the Machinery Industry Association to improve national goods is, at this critical juncture for the country, of utmost significance.

2.  At this time of war clouds gathering around the globe, the issue that we should pay the most attention to is production. Modern warfare is not only a scientific war but also an economic war. And if you want to enrich and develop the economy, you must first emphasize production. If production capacity increases, it can not only block leaks but also strengthen national power. Now, the purpose of the Machinery Industry Association is to enhance the effectiveness of production on the one hand and to study and improve the strategy of national goods on the other, both of which are fundamental conditions for production.

3.  The improvement and development of national goods are inherently the responsibility of each factory. But it also depends on the assistance of the government. We must know that the dumping of goods by the great powers relies on military force as its vanguard and also on national economic power as its backing. Now, our government should also do its best to encourage overseas trade, such as formulating regulations to protect the marketing of national goods, exempting machine-made imitations of foreign goods from tariffs, and so on. There is a need to quickly find solutions to all of these. As for the smuggling of inferior goods, it is a major problem today. The government must resolutely take effective measures to deal with it.

4.  There are generally two types of people who do not buy national goods. Those with weak economic capacity often do not care about inferior or smuggled goods, as long as they are cheap, they are happy to buy them. Those with sufficient economic capacity often seek refinement and splendor and harbor the prejudice that national goods are not as good as imported goods. In addition, in markets filled with smuggled and inferior goods, due to a lack of ability to distinguish, there are also quite a few people who mistakenly regard inferior goods as national goods. It is hoped that the association will continue to conduct extensive publicity for national goods, so that the public widely recognizes the obligation to use national goods. Do not say that the smallest thing is insignificant, or that the smallest item is irrelevant to the big picture. We must know that drops can become rivers and mosquitoes can become thunder. It is not a trivial matter.

Finally, in terms of national goods themselves, each factory must aim to be perfect, to constantly improve. The Chinese people's habits often involve imitating approximations, and then becoming self-satisfied. This is often why national goods are not easily welcomed. Secondly, the marketing of goods should be based on the principle of small profits and large sales. Because at this time of foreign goods dumping, when competing with foreign goods, setting prices too high will inevitably lead to elimination. Even in terms of the current social and economic situation, high prices will inevitably lead to sluggish sales. This is something that each factory should pay attention to.

### Completion of Singapore Airport

Construction Cost a Total of One Million Pounds; British Air Force Participates in Ceremony

[Singapore] The Singapore Airport, built at a cost of one million pounds, was officially opened yesterday by Sir Thomas, Governor of the Straits Settlements. After Sir Thomas finished his speech, he lit a beacon as a signal. The construction of the station is extremely sophisticated. The site was originally prone to miasma and only had a little water at high tide. Now, it has been raised with earth. The station's buildings can house post offices, restaurants, and hotels. The architecture is the latest style. The station has a deep-water pier that can accommodate seaplanes landing and mooring there. It also has clubhouses for the Imperial Singapore Aviation Club and the Volunteer Air Force. The Governor then made the first official landing on the Imperial Airways seaplane "Atlanta".

### Supply of Science Teachers in Japan Falls Short of Demand

Affected by Industrial Development

[Tokyo] In recent years, Japan's industry has been developing worldwide, and as a result of the active expansion of production capacity, there is an increasing demand for technicians from all sectors, which the Ministry of Education is unable to meet. Recently, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other subject teachers in secondary schools across the country have also been affected by this, resulting in adverse phenomena. Local education bureaus are feeling the difficulty of not being able to hire teachers and are actively consulting on countermeasures. The reason is that science teachers in secondary schools across the country have always been appointed from graduates of higher normal schools, but this is still insufficient. Graduates of various universities and higher industrial schools have also been appointed as secondary school teachers. However, recently, due to the rapid advancement of light and heavy industries and chemical industries, companies are making three times the profit. These secondary school teachers who graduated from universities and business and industrial schools are transferring to industrial companies. As a result, middle schools are feeling a teacher panic, especially the shortage of mathematics teachers. To alleviate the situation, the Ministry of Education is reportedly planning to establish more high-level industrial schools and temporary teacher training centers. (Domei News Agency, 14th)

[London] After the execution of senior Soviet Red Army generals such as Tukachevsky, the labor party newspaper, the Daily Citizen, published a commentary stating that those who love the country are most shocked and grieved by the recent events in the Soviet Union. It said that the Soviet Union has not only made great progress in domestic economic development, but also made significant contributions to world peace, and its future contributions are even more immeasurable. This is recognized by all who love the Soviet Union. But now, the Soviet Union is shrouded in a shadow of terror, which is only found in fascist countries, or is even worse than the Soviet Union. This is something we cannot understand, and even the repeated announcements from the country's officials are difficult to believe. (Central News Agency, 14th)

[New York] The US steel industry strike has been going on for three weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois have all been affected. More than 100,000 people have joined the strike. To date, there is no hope of a solution. The strike was initiated because three independent steel mills (namely, the Republic Chain Network Company, the Inland Steel Company, and the Youngerstown Steel Sheet Company) followed in the footsteps of the United Chain Steel Company and refused the union's right to sign work contracts on behalf of workers. The Industrial Organizations Committee then incited a strike to protest. Currently, Ohio Governor Taiwan has requested that President Roosevelt intervene and convene a meeting on the 16th of this month to discuss ways to resolve the strike. The auto industry strike in Monroe, Michigan, has not yet been resolved. The authorities have mobilized the militia to prepare for any eventuality. However, the auto industry union chairman Martin held a large-scale rally in Monroe to protest this move. As of 5:00 PM, no incidents had occurred. (Havas via Central News Agency, 13th)

[Paris] The French treasury will have large expenditures in the second half of this year to repay the £40 million loan from Britain (maturing in November this year) and the treasury bills issued by former Finance Minister Yaman Madan. In order to raise the necessary funds, Finance Minister Olyvar will submit a proposal at this afternoon's cabinet meeting, advocating for the reorganization of tax collection. The most important aspect is to increase the income tax rate for those with an annual income of 60,000 francs or more, so that the treasury's income is expected to increase by 400 million to 900 million francs.

### Pitiful! Also Lamentable!

Now there is a person who coughs from time to time, vomits blood from time to time, and has been treated repeatedly without recovery, resulting in a dismal look and a tired face. Suffering such a disaster, is it not pitiful?

Unfortunately coughing and vomiting blood, only to sit at home in boredom, lazily lying in bed, causing parents to be unhappy, wife to be sorrowful, and the family to be unfortunate to this point, how lamentable.

### Chaozhou Gun Execution of Smuggling Profiteers

Shande Yuanchang Firm Discovered Smuggling - Wang so-and-so incited smuggling and led vagrants into the interior - Arrested and turned over to the division for execution by firing squad

Since the authorities of Shantou, Chaozhou, and Shantou and Chaozhou began the anti-profiteering campaign this spring, those who colluded with vagrants to transport smuggled goods have been arrested. If the evidence is conclusive, they will be severely punished according to the law without any leniency. For example, Wang Jianmin of the Chenghai Party Committee, Hou Yingcheng, a leader of the Chao'an workers' circles, and Lin Xian of Jieyang were all executed by firing squad one after another. As a result, all profiteers have no way to operate, and certain cunning schemes cannot be carried out for the time being. It is said that a certain island across the sea from Shantou and Xiamen has seen its trade with Shantou plummet. Unexpectedly, Yang Jiechen, the manager of Deyuanchang Jingguo Firm on Ronglong Street in this city, still dared to smuggle goods on behalf of Zhenyu, Yongda, and other firms, secretly transporting them into the interior and making huge profits. Last month, 1050 cases of frozen cod imported by a certain country were exchanged by Deyuanchang, which led to the discovery by the industry's anti-smuggling association. It was planned to carry out the anti-profiteering punishment. Knowing that things were not good, Yang specially hosted a banquet for colleagues at Mingfang Restaurant the night before, using wine to explain and willing to pay a fine of 200 yuan and donate it to Cunxin Shantang to settle the matter. Also, Wang so-and-so from Chenghai usually colluded with vagrants to sell smuggled goods. Recently, as all merchants have already restrained themselves, Wang dared to do evil boldly, and also led vagrants to travel in the interior. He was currently arrested by the plainclothes team and handed over to the Chao'an Division for disposal. The division then received an order from the headquarters to impose the death penalty. On the 7th, Wang was executed by firing squad in Chaozhou City. (11th)

Travel Correspondence

### From Chengdu to Guanxian

— Geng Ya

Although the salt produced in Zigong is abundant, the 170,000 to 180,000 workers live in poverty all year round and cannot even support their families. It turns out that there are several very wealthy factory owners in Zigong, each with millions of dollars in income every year, but they do not invest in Zigong, nor do they save in other cities. Instead, they secretly transport and hide it in the "mountain villages" they built. In other words, the wealth specially produced in Zigong does not all benefit the Zigong market itself, but is hidden in the mountain villages. Therefore, what embellishes the prosperity of the Zigong market are many collection agencies, financial institutions, small industries and businesses, inns, restaurants, etc. However, there are still layers of exploitation involved. The so-called embellishment of prosperity is just a superficial article. This special situation is like the workers in Zigong who use windlasses to boil salt. Not only have they not enjoyed the appropriate benefits of salt production, but it has even affected their families. They cannot even afford the salt they produce.

It is said that there are several such "mountain villages" built under the above-mentioned relationship in the neighboring areas of Zigong. Among them, Da'an Village and Sanduo Village are the largest in scale. Sanduo Village can be seen remotely on the way from Neijiang to Zigong. It is built on a high hill of about 20 miles square, with city walls,碉樓 [碉樓 is a type of fortified multi-story watchtower/defensive structure common in southern China], and 100-zhang [Chinese unit of measurement] cliffs as the most dangerous natural outer walls. Therefore, although the local area has experienced many wars and bandit disturbances, it has never been captured. Currently, there are 300 to 400 households living there, all with the surnames Yan and Li. There is also a Western-style high-rise building that is particularly eye-catching in the sunlight. There are rice fields in the village that can be cultivated, and weapons that can help defend. There is only one road to enter and exit the village gate, and a custom-made household bamboo slip must be handed over to the guard to check. In this way, strangers cannot easily mix in.

After returning to Chengdu from Zigong, the reporter went to Guanxian. The bus run by merchants was in very bad order. The departure time was mostly based on the standard of gathering enough people. I was afraid that the number of people would gather before me, resulting in being left behind because of being full. So, I got up and went to the station before dawn. After passing through the West Gate and arriving at the station, I was lucky not to be left behind. So, I boarded the bus and set off. The construction of the Chengdu-Guan Road was even earlier than the Chengdu-Chongqing Road, and the road surface was still smooth and passable. Passing through Pixian, King Du Yu of Shu once established his capital here. He was a meritorious figure in the history of water control in Sichuan. According to legend, after his death, his soul turned into a "cuckoo," also known as "Zigui." It cries from early summer to late autumn, and the sound is slightly similar to "bitter cry," "bitter cry," calling again and again, its voice louder and clearer than the last. It is really like warning farmers not to forget the time for water control and disaster prevention. This is a myth. Further ahead, there are also the former residence monuments of Yang Ziyun and Sima Xiangru. This area belongs to the Chengdu Basin, where the water and soil are extremely fertile. Bamboo forests surround the villages, and green willows accompany the cars. The scenery along the way is like being in a painting.

Guanxian is located at the upper water inlet of the Sichuan Basin. Downstream to the southeast along the Minjiang River is the central plain of Sichuan Province. Upstream along the river is the northwest mountain area of Sichuan Province. The inclination is quite large. For example, Guanxian is only 60 kilometers away from Chengdu, but the terrain is as high as 300 meters. Guanxian's jurisdiction is very wide from east to west and very narrow from north to south, covering an area of about 24,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 200,000. Mountain areas are more than plains, accounting for about two-thirds. The Minjiang River runs through the north and south, dividing the county into two parts: east and west, commonly known as Hedong and Hexi. Hedong is a plain, and the county seat is in Hedong. Hexi is mostly mountainous, inhabited by Yi people, and the culture is relatively backward. Guanxian was once an important place where the forces of the Yi and Han people came into contact and rubbed against each other. Judging from the shapes of the mountain cities, majestic passes, and river trenches that it built, the meaning of military victory or defeat in those years is still left behind. Generally speaking, the most obvious difference between the Han and Yi people in Guanxian can only be seen in the economic sense. For example, what the Han people sell are things like cloth, tea, salt, and small industrial products, which are small in quantity and expensive in price. What the Yi people cross the Minjiang River bamboo rope bridge to sell are things like wood, firewood, charcoal, and medicinal materials, which are large in quantity and cheap in price. The contrast in the profits obtained by each other is naturally that the former is better than the latter. The scattered soldiers and ruffians in Guanxian City, as well as the Gelaohui [Gelaohui was a fraternal organization/secret society] party members in the four townships, often opposed the common people. It is said that the vagrants who cannot stand a firm foothold in Chengdu escape here to do evil. If they cannot stand a firm foothold again, they run across the bamboo rope bridge and hide in the mountainous area of Hexi, where they can escape everything. There is a saying: "Hedong people use sticks, Hexi people use knives," meaning that Hedong people resort to hitting, and Hexi people resort to killing. After hitting and killing, they then file a lawsuit. The county government receives an average of more than 30 lawsuits every day. However, once a judgment is made, regardless of victory or defeat, right or wrong, they will immediately stop the fight and rarely appeal. It is said that the Hexi knife wielders are all Gelaohui party members, especially arrogant and domineering, and arbitrarily oppress the villagers. Even those who are sent to be primary school teachers there must first join their society and collude with them. It can be seen that the county government's orders have not yet reached Hexi. Only last year's vigorous promotion of both kindness and power can be considered to be slightly more effective than before.

The current important policies promoted by the county government are: regarding the prohibition of opium, the county magistrate is responsible for prohibiting planting, and prohibiting transportation, sales, and smoking are still being handled in stages. Secondly, the granary storage should have reached the point of full warehouse storage since the promulgation of the granary storage regulations in the 17th year. However, in the past era of defense zones, all government orders were only conveyed by the provincial government, so there was not a single grain of grain in the granary storage. Later, because the defense zone system was broken and in view of the serious national crisis, 2,000 shi [Chinese unit of measurement, ~100 liters] were stored last year. Thirdly, training the strong has reached more than 30,000 people. As for civilian weapons, there are more than 3,000 firearms with brands, which are insufficient, so they are temporarily supplemented with knives and spears. I have seen the strong men gathered for training several times, most of them are enthusiastic and energetic, which gives people a very exciting feeling. In addition, special attention is paid to banning headscarves (i.e., beating the head), because it takes time and cloth to beat them, and they are also unsightly in appearance. In terms of urban appearance, this place is a trading center for the Han and Yi people. Most of the goods carried by the cars are transferred to the mountainous area by mule teams. Therefore, it is difficult to clean up cow dung and horse manure at all times.

The area of land is calculated in units of grain tax. Each grain tax is divided into 4 li, which is about one mu [Chinese unit of measurement, ~667 square meters] of land. Each two taels [Chinese unit of measurement, ~37 grams] of big grain (autumn grain) are levied at about 6.6 yuan, and small grain (spring grain) at 3.35 yuan, totaling less than 10 yuan. Each two taels of land can harvest more than 100 shi of grain. The small amount of silver was originally not heavy, but within a year, it is often levied on several years of grain, at least four times, which can be heavy. However, this is still the preferential treatment that the farmers of Guanxian get because they make great contributions to river engineering every year. If it is in other counties, the grain tax will still be higher than this standard.

According to last year's survey statistics, the main products are: tea 16,800 jin [Chinese unit of measurement, ~500 grams], which is divided into "belly tea," i.e., ordinary tea leaves, which are sold in various rules and regulations specifically for the Yi and Man villages; medicinal materials: Alisma 12,000 jin, Ligusticum chuanxiong 104,000 jin. The output in previous years was roughly the same as this number.

People without permanent property can also easily make a living. First, carrying charcoal; second, panning for gold. The placer gold produced in Shuimo Gully (90 li from the city) reaches about 2,000 taels per year, which is freely panned by gold diggers. No one has set up a factory to engage in large-scale mining.

### Xiamen Students Organize Movement to Resist Smuggling and Provide Disaster Relief

The organization was deemed non-compliant and the Party Department sent a letter to the Municipal Government to dissolve it - It will change its name and methods

Xiamen News: The "Xiamen City Secondary School Students' Joint Promotion Association for Resisting Smuggling and Providing Disaster Relief" was organized by students from various middle schools in Xiamen City. On June 5, representatives from various schools met and decided to hold the first preparatory meeting that day. On the 8th, the first preparatory meeting was held, and it was decided to hold the establishment meeting at Zhongshan Park on the 12th, followed by a parade to expand publicity. After that, the work of resisting smuggling and providing disaster relief will be carried out. On the 9th, after the news was published in various newspapers, the Municipal Party Department stated that the students' autonomous associations of various schools had not been legally established. The organization formed by the students' autonomous associations was naturally illegal. Moreover, the organization of the anti-smuggling association had not been filed for record, which was also non-compliant. The Municipal Party Department sent a letter to the Municipal Government, ordering it to dissolve the organization and sending police to monitor its actions. After the news came out, the student side immediately sent representatives Lin Guihe, Huang Chaoyun, and more than ten others to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government with a petition, requesting approval for filing. The original petition strongly stated that smuggling by certain parties was rampant and had recently spread along the coast, causing great harm. The drought in Sichuan, Henan, and other provinces was serious, and the starving people were everywhere. For the sake of national defense and humanitarianism, the students, as members of the people, should take responsibility. Therefore, they formed this association and decided to establish it on the 12th. They requested approval for filing and requested that personnel be sent to guide them at that time, etc. They also explained the motives and process of forming the association face-to-face. Xie Xinming, a cadre of the Municipal Party Department, received them and promised to ask the Provincial Party Department for instructions. They must postpone the proceedings until they receive a reply from the Provincial Party Department. Chen Shirui, the first section chief of the Municipal Government, received them and promised to report to the mayor on their behalf. By the afternoon, according to news from the Municipal Party Department, the Party Department believed that the organization launched and organized in the name of the students' autonomous associations of various schools had no legal basis. If they could change to launching and organizing in the name of student representatives of various schools and did not use the word "joint," it would not violate the law and could be approved. Otherwise, they would have to wait for instructions from the superior Party Department. It is reported that the Municipal Party Department has agreed to change the name to "Xiamen City Secondary School Student Representatives' Association for Resisting Smuggling and Providing Disaster Relief." Other proceedings have also been changed. The Municipal Government summoned the principals of various middle schools in the evening to discuss a proper solution. The anti-smuggling and disaster relief association may be established, but the organization and movement methods must be changed. (June 11)

### Songjiang

Bank Robbery Case Cracked

The Xiwai Dianye Bank was suddenly robbed of 10,000 yuan on New Year's Eve according to the lunar calendar. On the 12th of this month, Yang Shijie, the former chief of the detective team of the County Police Bureau, received a report that the main criminal in the case was hiding in Hengtong Road, Zhabei, Shanghai. He led detectives Wei Yunhui and several other detectives to go there, disguised and waited. Only on the 14th, at about 4:00 a.m., did they learn that the criminal was renting in Quanlefang on that road. Team Leader Yang and others bravely entered and arrested the robber Dai Abao on the spot, seizing a suitcase containing 7,016 yuan in silver dollars. That night, he hired a car to escort him to the Songjiang Bureau. The robber Dai confessed that he had colluded with a certain old class to commit the robbery. The Police Bureau Chief immediately telegraphed Zhang, the procurator of the District Court, on the evening of the 14th to jointly interrogate him and pursue the main criminal.

Trial of Maid Murder Case

The District Court opened a trial on the 14th for the case of college student Jiang Changchi killing his maid. The trial opened at 9:00 a.m., and more than 100 people were in attendance. Lawyers Zhang Shejie and Chen Kunyuan still appeared in court to defend him. The interrogating officer first questioned Jiang Changchi briefly, and then summoned Lu Zhongyu, the inspector of the County Police Bureau, and Liu Fenghao, the former town chief of the town, to inquire in detail whether the defendant was in a state of mental illness when he was arrested. Finally, his father Jiang Anren was questioned, but Anren suffered from mental illness and his answers were vague and irrelevant. At this point, the defendant's defense lawyer stated that the existence of the defendant's mental illness was not credible without forensic identification. He said that the defendant had a recurrence of his illness last summer and had consulted with Dr. Li Wangping of this county, and there was a prescription that could be used as evidence. He should ask the court to summon Dr. Li and his classmates from Shanghai to the court for questioning. The interrogating officer immediately approved the identification of the defendant's mental illness in this case and asked the Judicial Yuan to assign a forensic doctor to Songjiang for identification. He replied that there was no such equipment and asked to hire experts nearby for identification. The court has now sent a letter to Shanghai to hire experts to come to Songjiang for identification. Doctors and witnesses will be summoned to court for interrogation next time.

### Changshu

Continuing to Expand the East-West Trunk Road

The county has widened the north-south trunk road and is now tidying up the road surface, which will soon be completed. However, the east-west trunk line (from the west gate to Jiguan outside the east gate) will soon continue to be built. Currently, the town chiefs along the Qian River, regarding this matter, held a joint meeting yesterday and decided to offer two points of opinion to the authorities: 1. The east-west trunk road is lined with merchants, and construction should start on July 1 and last for three months to reduce losses to merchants. 2. The land price in the commercial market is relatively expensive, and widening it to eight meters is the most appropriate. Overwriting will be a great sacrifice. The above two points will be submitted to the county government by the Town Chiefs Joint Association for request.

### Wuxi

Pharmacy Illegally Manufactures Poisonous Pills

Tongjichun Pharmacy on Hanchang Road outside Guangfu Gate is a company funded by Xian Zhuxuan and has good business. The day before yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival. The store stopped employing Chen Shaoyuan in order to save expenses. Chen was unwilling and secretly reported to the First Police Station at about 9:00 p.m., saying that the store was illegally manufacturing opium-quitting pills, which contained opium ingredients in the half-summer of opium-quitting potion. Director Zhang received the report and immediately sent police officer Feng and police officer Ning to search. Unexpectedly, Zhu Hongjun, the accountant, tried to bribe them with 30 yuan in legal tender, but was rejected by the police. Zhu was detained, and a search was carried out. As a result, five packs of opium-quitting pills weighing about half a catty, a bottle of suspicious powder, and a can of black ten-production half-summer were found.

When they were captured, a total of 300 to 400 yuan in legal tender and silver coins were found on the bandits. They are now stored in the Taixing County Stolen Goods Warehouse. One of the bandits, Fang Zhenchun, and others, who were subsequently captured in the county, was captured by the Shangxugang Security Team and is still under investigation by the team. The police will be sent again to escort them back in the coming days. After the six criminals were escorted to Changzhou, Xu Baoguang, director of the Public Security Bureau, and Chen Qi, leader of the Detective Team, interrogated them at the Detective Team headquarters at about 10:00 p.m. During the interrogation, Xu Jiafa confessed that he had robbed Kuai Village Town seven times. The bandits gathered at a certain place from Shanghai, Wuhu, and Nanjing in three groups. When they arrived at the town, the big leader gave them red cloths as a sign. The slogan was "Our own people," "I got 21 yuan," and so on. The criminals were escorted to the county on the 14th for further investigation and handling.

### After the Haili Steamer Ran Aground, All Passengers Were Transferred to the Haizhen Steamer to Return to Shanghai

One hundred and thirty-four people are expected to arrive at 9:00 AM today. The ship will return to Shanghai after being stranded on the beach for five or six days.

The Haili steamer of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ran aground in the waters of Shipu, Wenzhou, with the fourth hold breached and flooded. Details were reported in yesterday's edition. Now the ship has left the reefs and sailed to a nearby beach, where it is stranded on the shore to prevent it from sinking after further water intake. All passengers on board were rescued by the Haizhen steamer at 4:00 PM yesterday and are expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. The rescue work of the Haili steamer is also underway. Further updates are recorded below:

Ran Aground Due to Accident

The Haili steamer's accident was due to a natural disaster, which was irresistible by human force, greatly different from the situation of the Haiyuan steamer. According to the report from Haili's captain, Xi Shibiao, yesterday, the cause of the accident was that the Haili was returning to Shanghai from Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Shantou. At 10:35 PM on the 12th, when the ship arrived in the waters of Wenzhou, near the Southern Yushan area of Shipu, the fog was very heavy, making it almost impossible to see anything. Due to the ship's schedule, the Haili was unable to anchor at sea and had to proceed with caution as usual. However, sailing in heavy fog is extremely dangerous. When the ship reached the foot of the Southern Yushan Mountain, there were many hidden reefs. As the Haili moved forward, the outer side of the fourth hold of the ship scraped violently against a hidden reef. The reef was as sharp as a knife, and the steel plate of the fourth hold was cut open by the reef. Seawater immediately flooded into the hold. This is the truth of the accident, and it was not that the reef pierced through the hull.

Stranded on the Beach for Emergency Rescue

After scraping the reef, the steamer continued to move forward. By the time Captain Teng realized that the hull was broken and that the ship was heavily laden with cargo and flooding, it was extremely dangerous. At this time, it was already 11:20 PM. Wanting to anchor at sea, but fearing that the ship might sink, Captain Teng, in addition to urgently reporting to the Shanghai Head Office and requesting rescue, decided to ensure the safety of all lives and property on board and to prevent the ship from sinking. He resolutely decided to steer the ship at full speed towards the beach of Taitou Mountain near Southern Yushan, and crash the ship onto the sandy beach there, so that the entire ship would be stranded on the shallow sandy beach to prevent the ship from sinking. By 11:30 PM, this emergency stranding work was successfully completed.

Three Steamers for Rescue

The company was extremely alarmed when it received the news of the accident. The Sihai steamer is regarded as the lifeline of the company's business and is a new ship that is watched by the whole country. Since its launch, no accidents have occurred. Now, two steamers have run aground in half a month, which is shocking. The Haili steamer alone is worth about four million yuan in terms of cargo and ship, and there are more than three hundred passengers and crew members, which is a huge matter. The General Manager and Deputy General Manager and others decided to send the Sanhai steamer, which was already en route, to be responsible for rushing to the rescue. One was the Haiyan steamer, which was sailing from Wenzhou, one was the Haizhen steamer, which was returning to Shanghai from Nanhua, and one was the Yongsheng steamer, which was chartered by the company. All were ordered by telegram to rush to the rescue. The company also ordered the Gongping steamer in Shanghai to stand by for later orders, in case it was needed to assist. The mission of the three steamers, Haizhen and Haiyan, was to rescue passengers and mail and transport them to Shanghai, while the Yongsheng steamer was to be dedicated to lightering cargo. Yesterday morning, all three steamers arrived at the scene.

Passengers Rescued

The company's original intention was to order the Haiyan to rescue and carry passengers to Shanghai. However, by noon yesterday, Captain Teng telegraphed that the Haiyan needed to stay there temporarily to assist with other rescue work. All passengers on board had been rescued by the Haizhen steamer, which had arrived in time, and transferred to that ship. Later, at 6:00 PM, a telegram stated that the number of passengers who had been rescued and boarded the Haizhen steamer included twenty-two in the grand dining room, fifteen in the first-class cabins, forty in the second-class cabins, thirty in the third-class cabins, and twenty-seven in the fourth-class cabins, totaling one hundred and thirty-four people. Some of them were transferred to the Haiyan steamer. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the two steamers left the waters of Taitou Mountain with the rescued passengers and headed straight for Shanghai. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai around 9:00 AM this morning.

Rescue in Progress

Currently, the Haili steamer is lightering the cargo in hold number four into the Yongsheng steamer, in order to empty the hold, pump out the accumulated water, and carry out patching and repair work. The No. 1 Haitefeng tugboat, which was sent by the Shanghai Head Office to tow and rescue the Haili steamer, reportedly arrived at the scene yesterday. The rescue tools and equipment that were brought were moved onto the Haili steamer starting at 7:00 AM yesterday to prepare for the rescue work. Moreover, fearing that there might be pirates looting in the waters, the original escort police on board were considered insufficient. The company requested the Ganlu warship of the Zhejiang Offshore Police Force to sail to the side of the Haili steamer at Taitou Mountain yesterday afternoon to provide protection. Six fully armed soldiers, along with machine guns, etc., were sent to the Haili steamer for escort. Yesterday, the company submitted seven telegrams sent by the captain after the ship's accident to the Ministry and notified the insurance department of the Central Trust Bureau. If the ship proceeds smoothly, it will take five or six days to rescue it to Shanghai for major repairs in the dock. Part of the cargo in the four holds has been damaged by water, along with the damaged hull. The loss due to the delay in the voyage is also enormous. The amount will be known after investigation and calculation.

### The Eurasia Shanghai-Hong Kong Route Opens on July 1st

The entire route is over 2,000 kilometers long and is expected to be completed in twelve hours.

Eurasia Aviation Company's planned resumption of the Ping-Guangdong route, further extending from Guangzhou to Hong Kong to complete direct flights between Ping and Hong Kong, has been approved by the Ministry of Transportation. Approval has also been obtained from the Hong Kong government to establish a landing station in Hong Kong, so all planning is proceeding very smoothly. It is learned that the equipment at each station on the entire route has been sorted out separately and will be officially opened on the first of next month. The company has also sent Huang Chao and Deng Haozhang to the south tomorrow morning to actively arrange everything in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The following are details from the Dagong News Agency:

Longest Route

Eurasia Company believes that Hong Kong has been vigorously managed by the British government for many years, and sea, land, and air transportation has become increasingly developed, so commerce is also becoming more prosperous. Airlines from Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and other countries have also set up terminals or liaison stations there, so Hong Kong has become an important hub for Far Eastern air navigation. In order to develop competitive business, the company plans to resume the suspended Ping-Guangdong route on the one hand and further extend it from Guangzhou to Hong Kong to operate Ping-Hong Kong flights. It is learned that this plan is already mature, and the route runs through South China and North China, following the Ping-Han and Yue-Han roads, passing through nine provinces, and is over two thousand three hundred kilometers long, making it the longest existing private route in our country.

Twelve Hours

For the section between Ping and Hankou on the Ping-Hong Kong route, the route has already been restored. The stations between Hankou and Guangzhou already have airports, radio stations, and other equipment, which can be used with slight adjustments. The newly added radio stations in Liuzhou, Changsha, and Guangzhou have also been equipped, so there is no problem with the entire route. It is heard that the aircraft that will be configured for this route will be large twin-engine Rong克斯 aircraft, flying back and forth twice a week. They will take off at 6:00 AM and complete the entire journey at 6:00 PM that night, so the long distance of two thousand three hundred kilometers can be completed in just twelve hours.

Assign Staff

Since all planning matters are generally in order, the company has decided to officially open the route on the first of next month and has specially appointed Huang Chao, Director of the Nanjing Air Station, and Deng Haozhang, Director of the Hankou Air Station, to take a boat south tomorrow morning, carrying all the station equipment and aircraft materials to Hong Kong and Guangzhou to arrange everything and set up offices to engage in business negotiations.

### The Municipal Federation Firmly Opposes the Tax Increase

Conserve Unnecessary Expenses in Order to Achieve Financial Reasonableness

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to increase the municipal general tax, arguing that the market has not yet recovered and taxpayers cannot afford it. Later, at the Taxpayers' Chinese Association's representative meeting on April 12, the following resolution was made on the proposal: "Regarding the proposal by the Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council to increase taxes from July 1, 1937, it should be postponed until next year for further review, and the Shanghai Municipal Council should be ordered to effectively reduce unnecessary expenses and collect overdue taxes this year in order to achieve reasonableness." However, at the Westerners' annual meeting on the 14th of the same month, it was resolved to "extend the implementation to January 1 of next year." The Federation regrets that two months have passed, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet implemented the resolution of the Taxpayers' Chinese Association, which represents the majority of the population and tax revenue. According to the Federation's spokesperson, if the Shanghai Municipal Council does not first eliminate financial waste, then even if the tax increase is extended to next year, it will still be firmly opposed by citizens and taxpayers. It is also learned that the Federation has scheduled to send a letter to the Taxpayers' Chinese Association within a few days, requesting it to supervise the Shanghai Municipal Council to effectively implement the resolution to reduce unnecessary expenses and collect overdue taxes so that the Council's finances can be rationalized.

The headquarters is located at No. 550 North Suzhou Road in this city, and the applied route will be sailed first to provide relief to the unemployed workers of the former China Merchants Inland River Bureau.

### The Yarn Exchange Dispute Continued to Be Mediated Yesterday, and Auctioning Will Resume Today

Vice Minister Cheng and Others Urged Both the Bulls and Bears to Reconcile Yesterday; If Reconciliation Fails, the Government Will Handle It According to Law

The New Voice News Agency reports that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has ordered the competent authorities to thoroughly investigate the yarn and cotton disputes in the Shanghai Commercial Yarn and Cloth Exchange market, and those who manipulate speculation will be severely punished. The Supervisory Yuan has sent special commissioners to secretly investigate after receiving the order. Cheng Tiangu, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, summoned representatives of the brokers' association yesterday morning to guide them to reconcile on their own. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the local association, will resume mediation, and auctioning can resume as usual today. The details are recorded as follows:

The Vice Minister Summoned Representatives Again for Talks

Cheng Tiangu, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, together with Counselor Chen Yu, Section Chief Kuang Yunwen, and Exchange Supervisor Wang Xiaolai, summoned Shao Wenmei and Zhou Shaokang, Vice Presidents of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange Brokers' Association, and Wu Fangqi and Pan Shouzhi, representatives of the bull brokers, again at the New Asia Restaurant at 10:00 AM yesterday, urging them to maintain the market and hoping that the bulls would make concessions to resolve the matter as soon as possible. Wu Wenqi and other representatives of the bulls stated that after receiving the advice from the Vice Minister and others, they contacted the bull clients who entrusted the transactions and agreed to make concessions in accordance with the closing price of last Friday for the sake of the overall market. Finally, Vice Minister Cheng ordered them to reconcile and that if reconciliation fails, the government will handle it according to law. They dispersed at about 11:00 AM.

Brokers Submit a Summary to the Vice Minister

The Yarn and Cloth Exchange Brokers' Association submitted a summary to Cheng Tiangu, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce. The original text is as follows: "Respectfully submit that the establishment of a market is originally intended to stabilize prices and assist industry and commerce. Since our government promulgated the Exchange Law, the management has been thorough, and merchants and people have praised it. However, recently, there have been occasional merchants outside the industry who deliberately monopolize public bonds and flour, and disputes have repeatedly occurred due to manipulation. Fortunately, your ministry resolutely handled the matter and eliminated the hidden dangers. Unexpectedly, the old habits have re-emerged recently, and they have vigorously purchased yarn and cotton in the yarn and cloth market, seeking to obtain a number of shares regardless of the market price. The quantity is huge, encompassing the entire city, causing the price of standard yarn and cotton to suddenly soar, exceeding the normal range. The price of futures cotton yarn has soared by more than 20 yuan in a few days, causing panic. Recently, it has been forced to suspend due to demand exceeding supply. It is found that the price of American cotton fell sharply by more than 40 points on June 8, and has continued to fall by more than 20 points recently. At the same time, Indian cotton has also plummeted by five or six rupees. Moreover, comparing the current yarn market price with the exchange's standard market price, the spot yarn price is actually cheaper by more than 5 yuan. Moreover, comparing the supply and demand situation between the buying and selling parties of the exchange's standard cotton yarn with the actual supply and demand situation of spot yarn, one side is in full swing, with demand exceeding supply, while the other side is sluggish and few transactions are completed. In the same time and the same city, the market conditions are so different, which is known to everyone as monopoly. However, these people disregard everything and do as they please. If they are allowed to act recklessly, the result will not only be that all the brokers in the association will bear the brunt and be sacrificed innocently. The consequences will be that prices will be raised horizontally, the people's livelihood will be endangered, foreign goods will take the opportunity to dump, and the country's leakage will become even greater. If this continues, the country's finances and social stability will be affected. The association feels that the situation is dangerous and dares not remain silent. Please, your Excellency, consider the people's livelihood and grant relief. Then, not only will all the brokers in the association be grateful, but we are also waiting for your urgent orders."

Du Yuesheng Urged Both Sides to Reconcile

Shao Wenmei and Zhou Shaokang, Vice Presidents of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange Brokers' Association, Wu Wenqi and Pan Shouzhi, representatives of the bull brokers, and Zhu Wenqi and Zhang Bojin, representatives of the bear brokers, visited Du Yuesheng, chairman of the local association, at 2:00 PM yesterday. After being urged to reconcile, the representatives of the bulls agreed to settle the price according to the market price on the 11th, and the representatives of the bears requested that the settlement be made in accordance with Article 154 of the exchange's business rules using the average price of the last ten days. They dispersed at about 3:00 PM. According to a reporter from New Voice News Agency, the market price last Friday (i.e., the red card) was 290 yuan for the June contract, 280 yuan and 35 jiao for the July contract, 280 yuan and 5 jiao for the August contract, and 280 yuan for the September contract. At the end of the last ten days, the June contract was about 280 yuan.

Negotiations for Reconciliation, Auctioning Resumes Today

After Cheng Tiangu, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, and Du Yuesheng, chairman of the local association, urged both the bulls and bears to reconcile on their own, the bulls have now agreed to make concessions, so reconciliation is approaching. The Shanghai Commercial Yarn and Cloth Exchange has decided to resume auctioning as usual this morning. Furthermore, Cheng Tiangu, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, Du Yuesheng, chairman of the local association, Mu Ouchu, Chairman of the Shanghai Commercial Yarn and Cloth Exchange, and Wang Xiaolai, Exchange Supervisor, and others held another meeting last night to exchange views on the bull's proposed concession plan and the bear's request for a price settlement plan and decided that the bull and bear sides would reconcile on their own. According to the Dagong News Agency, after the representatives of the bulls, Pan Shouzhi and Wu Wenqi, withdrew, they immediately returned to the exchange and, together with Shao Wenmei and Zhou Shaokang, the two presidents of the Brokers' Association, summoned the inside brokers and clients to consult and conducted consultations with the buying clients who entrusted the transactions in accordance with the instructions of the Vice Minister. However, the bull brokers' opinion that the price should be settled according to the market price on the 11th (last Friday) (i.e., the red card) was not approved by the buying clients. The general opinion of all the short selling clients is that the sharp rise in yarn prices this time has resulted in losses and that the transaction must be settled in accordance with Item 8 of Article 154 of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange's Business Rules, which states that "when a transaction cannot be closed and the danger to the broker and others involved cannot be reduced, the price may be settled using the average price of the ten days before." Only then will it be fair. Therefore, there are many difficulties in reaching an agreement on the settlement of prices, and consultations are still ongoing. It is rumored that the bull clients have agreed to make concessions, and the buyers and sellers have unanimously denied that the price will be settled according to the red card on the 11th.

The Ministry of Finance Issues Two Orders to Thoroughly Investigate

Order from the Ministry of Finance to the Exchange Supervisor (One of Them) and Order to the Shanghai Exchange Supervisor Regarding the Presentation of Telegrams Reporting the Suspension of Auctioning for September Yarn and Changes in Market Prices at Various Locations. I Request Your Supervision and Verification. I Have Read Both Telegrams. It is Found That There Have Been Occasional Changes in the Shanghai Exchange Market Recently. Previously, According to the Presentation by Ruichang Yarn Company and Others Regarding the Banning of Futures Yarn Speculation, the Ministry Ordered the Officer to Thoroughly Investigate and Provide a Reply. Subsequently, According to Yandai's Telegram Reporting the Reasons for and the Course of Market Changes, You Were Further Ordered to Report the Handling Situation for Record. Now, According to the Reported Details, It is Obvious That Speculators Are Deliberately Spreading Rumors in an Attempt to Disrupt the Market and Take the Opportunity to Profit, Which Is Truly Hateful. A Thorough Investigation and Strict Inquiry Should Be Made to Stabilize the Market. You Should Abide by This Order and Provide a Reply for Verification. This Order. (Second) Order to the Shanghai Exchange Supervisor Regarding a Telegram Reporting That Speculators Are Manipulating and Wildly Buying Up Yarn, Causing Yarn Prices to Continuously Soar and Suspend, and Asking How to Handle the Matter. I Request Your Approval and Instructions. I Have Read the Telegram. Recently, the Futures Yarn Market Has Been Severely Damaged, and the Changes in the Situation Have Been Repeatedly Ordered to Be Thoroughly Investigated and Strictly Investigated. Now, According to the Reported Details, You Should Investigate the Names of the Large Buyers and Sellers, Thoroughly Investigate to the Root, and Accurately Report for Legal Action in Accordance with the Law. This Order.

### City Police Bureau to Implement Rehabilitation for Smokers Under Thirty Years Old

Over 5,000 Smokers Have Re-Registered; Implementing a Permit System for Purchasing Opium to Facilitate Management and Inspection

Our city's smoker registration, which concluded on September 10th of last year, has led to the detention of many unregistered smokers by police precinct stations in various districts. To facilitate the planned implementation of a permit system for purchasing opium, approval was obtained from the National Anti-Opium Supervision Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission. Supplemental registration for smokers began on the first of last month, and as of yesterday, over 5,000 smokers had voluntarily registered. The bureau is on schedule to complete its anti-opium work and is currently planning the management of smokers and continued inspections. Details are outlined below:

Enthusiastic Response to Voluntary Registration

Since the City Police Bureau received approval from the National Anti-Opium Supervision Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission to conduct supplemental registration for smokers starting May 1st, over 5,600 smokers have voluntarily registered as of yesterday. All have been approved and issued permits by the bureau's Anti-Opium Section. Smokers residing in the foreign concessions need only register a communication address in the Chinese-controlled area to be eligible for registration. A request has been submitted to the Municipal Government to issue new-style smoker permits, implementing a permit system for purchasing opium to facilitate management and inspection.

Rehabilitation for Young Smokers

The bureau has decided to categorize registered smokers by age, dividing them into five phases of rehabilitation, each lasting one year, with a reduction of one-fifth each year. For the sake of implementing rehabilitation, those smokers under 30 years old will undergo rehabilitation first. However, given the city's limited rehabilitation facilities, including the Hu Nan and Hu Bei Opium Addiction Treatment Hospitals, the Criminal Rehabilitation Hospital Temporary Detoxification Center, with a total of 550 beds capable of treating 1,000 smokers per month, and the 20 registered hospitals designated by the Health Bureau to assist in the effort, the required bed space is still insufficient. The police bureau is currently collaborating with the Health Bureau to plan and expand bed capacity, with the intention of implementing this plan in the near future to completely eradicate opium addiction by 1940.

Processing Travel Permits for Smokers

This city is a major port for trade, with a high volume of smokers traveling in and out. Without established regulations for smoker travel, management would be particularly inconvenient, and smokers themselves would experience hardship. The bureau has drafted four principles for issuing travel permits to smokers: ㊀ When traveling outside the city, smokers must carry their original permit and obtain a travel permit for inspection by military police along the way. ㊁ The travel permit must bear the holder's photograph and is valid only for the individual, preventing impersonation. ㊂ No fees will be charged for travel permits. ㊃ The issuing agency for the smoker's travel permit will notify the anti-opium authority at the destination to ensure strict supervision. Any false declarations or failure to arrive at the declared destination will be subject to investigation. These travel permits are currently being prepared and will be announced and implemented soon.

### Customs Authorities Claim Smuggling in This City is Nearly Eliminated

Result of Social Sanctions and Customs Officers' Efforts

The continuous incidents of rogue Japanese nationals forcibly engaging in large-scale smuggling and assaulting customs officers have drawn widespread attention. Our customs authorities have protested to the Japanese consulate, but, it is said, have yet to receive a reply. All sectors of this city have organized boycotts of smuggled goods to curb smuggling, which has recently been extended to various parts of the interior. As a result, the clamor about smuggling has gradually subsided. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency visited customs authorities to understand the situation, inquiring about recent smuggling activities. According to them, smuggling by rogue Japanese nationals has indeed been eliminated. Not only has large-scale smuggling ceased to be seen, but even the previously scattered smuggling of items such as seafood has been declared eradicated, a complete elimination. This is not due to remorse on the part of the Japanese nationals or intervention from some party, but rather due to social sanctions and the diligent efforts of customs officers to combat smuggling. The peak of smuggling was around March and April of this year. Customs officers, unafraid of difficulties, diligently performed their duties, using force to stop such hard smuggling after several instances of bloodshed. Since the outbreak of smuggling in Shanghai, a total of two customs officers and four tax police officers have been injured. Smuggled goods seized by customs, such as gold bars, copper coins, and rayon, are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, dealing a significant blow to the Japanese nationals. Later, seeing that the hard smuggling policy had failed, the Japanese nationals changed their methods, secretly transporting smuggled goods and installing hidden compartments on various ships. During this period, customs officers faced the greatest difficulty in searching for smuggled goods, as customs personnel wore uniforms and worked on a fixed schedule, making it easy for the Japanese nationals to avoid them, allowing the smuggled goods to flow smoothly. Seeing the difficulty of searching, customs authorities also changed their anti-smuggling methods, offering rewards for information. Those who reported smuggling and whose information led to the seizure of smuggled goods would receive four percent of the value of the goods as a reward. Since the implementation of this method in mid-April, the results have been immediate. Several reports of smuggling are received daily, and the smaller ones are immediately investigated and broken up. For larger cases, when the smuggled goods are fully loaded, all members of the Class A and B search teams are dispatched to apprehend them in one fell swoop, according to the information received. Therefore, even scattered smuggling has been eradicated. The situation with the confiscation of smuggled goods is the best it has ever been.

### State-Run Transportation Agencies in This City Held a Joint Commemoration Week Yesterday

Minister Yu and Vice Minister Peng Attended and Delivered Speeches

State-run transportation agencies in this city held a commemoration week yesterday morning at 8:00 AM at the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation presided over the event. Formal ceremonies were performed.

Minister's Speech

Minister Yu said in his speech, "Whenever I come to Shanghai, I usually have to return to Beijing soon, and I don't have the opportunity to speak to everyone individually. This time, I am in Shanghai during the commemoration week, so I am taking this opportunity to speak to everyone. The Ministry of Transportation has made considerable progress recently, which could not have been achieved by any individual in the ministry. It is the result of the efforts and cooperation of all the personnel in various agencies. The Ministry of Transportation has done a great deal of work, and I hope everyone will pay special attention in the future. The government now has a comprehensive five-year construction plan, and each ministry also has a five-year plan. The Ministry of Transportation is no exception, starting from the 26th year of the Republic [1937]. However, there is a shortage of talent. Often, we want to do things, but there are no appropriate people for the job. Therefore, everyone must pay attention to talent and find ways to recruit them to overcome temporary difficulties. The postal service has done quite a lot. I went abroad to study in the past and know that some foreign postal services have 100,000 employees, and the United States has 200,000 employees daily. Our country only has 30,000 to 40,000, which shows that our postal service does not handle many affairs. There are still many villages that do not have postal service. The amount of postal savings in our country is only 57 million, which is not even a fraction of what foreign countries have. Why is the amount of postal savings in our country so small? The reasons are nothing more than the following: ㊀ Most people in the country are poor. When I went to Sichuan, I asked the local post office about the amount of savings deposits and learned that it was only 7,000 yuan, and most of the depositors were postal workers, which shows the poverty of the people there. ㊁ Our country only started postal savings in 1919, while foreign countries started decades ago. For example, Japan started in the Meiji 4th year [1871], which shows that the start was not early, which is also one of the reasons. ㊂ In the past, because the situation was not bad, fixed-term deposits of more than two years were not handled, adhering to the principle of stability and austerity. ㊃ Bank interest rates can reach one point [1%] or more, and even two or three points in the private sector, which is also a reason for the underdeveloped postal savings. In addition, third-class post offices do not handle savings, so people have no way to save, which is also a reason for the underdeveloped postal service. The current situation is very different from the past. Communication is extremely convenient, and the currency system has been unified. Starting from the 26th year of the Republic [1937], we must do our best to promote it. Other services, such as postal simple life insurance, must also be promoted, starting from the Ministry of Transportation and its affiliated agencies, and then to other government agencies and local people. Postal bureaus and savings bureaus must pay close attention to this business to achieve the goal. In terms of telecommunications, due to insufficient funding, not much has been done. Foreign countries often allocate funds from the government to operate this business, so they have sufficient strength and can easily see results. The Japanese government has proposed tens of millions of yuan to build the telecommunications industry, so the results are remarkable, and there is a three-year plan to universally establish cables. Our country's wired telephone network is expected to be completed within this year, and the wireless telephone network is expected to be completed by June of next year.

Shipping Administration

Within the five-year plan of the Ministry of Transportation, shipbuilding has also been determined. Although shipbuilding is difficult, large ships must be ordered from foreign countries, but foreign countries have already finalized their orders for 1940 and cannot add any more. Currently, the tonnage of foreign ships is about 19 million tons for the United Kingdom, about 12 million tons for the United States, and Japan can reach 5 million tons by the end of this year. Now foreign countries are very concerned about shipbuilding. Japan is also paying close attention to the shipping industry in the Tianjin area. Our government is also preparing to reward shipbuilding, some of which will be used to build new ships and some to dismantle old ships, and it is determined to be done in the 26th year of the Republic [1937]. However, there is a great lack of talent for driving, which should be given special attention. The progress in aviation is quite rapid. There are many transportation projects to be done, and transportation related to national defense is particularly important. The mission we bear is extremely important. I hope everyone will work diligently on all aspects of the business."

Vice Minister's Speech

Vice Minister Peng of the Ministry of Transportation then delivered a speech, saying briefly, "It is rare for colleagues from various agencies of the Ministry of Transportation to gather together today. The three major policies of the Ministry of Transportation have already been explained clearly by the minister, and I have nothing else to say. I can only share some thoughts. Our country's transportation is far inferior to Japan's. Japan not only has cables densely covering the land, but also has cables on the seabed. Their ships are not only sufficient for domestic navigation, but can also sail to Europe and the United States to carry goods from other countries back. Although our country has made great progress in recent years, it is still far behind foreign countries. Foreigners, no matter what they do, are constantly innovating and striving, always wanting to break records. Our people often have a mindset of 'good enough' and do not strive for progress, which is a shortcoming. Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that German and French aviation were cooperating, and the aviation line could directly reach our country. Although it is not known whether this is true, foreigners are not afraid of complexity and do not care about profit and loss, but always move forward and do it. This spirit is truly admirable. We are catching up as quickly as possible, and I hope all colleagues will work hard with the spirit of constantly striving to break records. The so-called five-year plan is something that all departments want to compete to do, so judging from the situation in recent years, our country has great hope. Please, colleagues, work together with one heart." The report concluded, and the ceremony ended at 9:00 AM.

### South China Rice Company to Open Before Autumn Harvest

Rice Mills to be Established in Wuhu and Guangzhou; Chen Bozhuang to Inspect Factory Sites in Guangdong

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the South China Rice Company, which was established in early April, has been actively working on internal affairs for more than two months. It was originally scheduled to open in mid-June, but due to the unfinished work, it has been decided to postpone the opening until before the autumn harvest. Its future business scope includes: ㊀ conducting or contracting for the buying and selling of five types of rice grains; ㊁ operating rice grain warehouse businesses; ㊂ establishing rice mills in areas with concentrated rice production. Mr. Chen Bozhuang, the general manager of the company, has already identified the site for the rice mill in Wuhu last month, and it is currently under construction. It is learned that Mr. Chen, in view of the prosperity of Guangzhou's commerce and to facilitate transportation, also plans to establish a rice mill there. He took a boat to Guangzhou a few days ago to inspect the site for two weeks and will return to Shanghai soon.

### National Products United Operations Company Expands Overseas Markets

Opening a National Products Commercial Firm in Singapore

Since its establishment, the China National Products United Operations Company has spared no effort in carrying out various tasks. In addition to separately planning to establish national products companies and national products stores in various parts of the country, it is also actively expanding overseas markets, striving to ensure that domestic products reach everywhere, and paying special attention to places where overseas Chinese gather, giving priority to starting there. It is learned that the company will soon open a Chinese National Products Commercial Firm in Singapore in the Nanyang region. The site has been selected on the upper floor of the Bank of China building on Cecil Street, a commercial center in the new port. A cooperation agreement has been negotiated with local overseas Chinese merchant Mr. Chen Yueshu. At the same time, advertisements have been placed in local and foreign factories producing domestic goods, stating that those who intend to promote their products to Nanyang can visit the company's business group at No. 224 Tianjin Road, Shanghai, between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM every day, bringing samples, price lists, and other documents.

### National Products Competition to Hold Manufacturers' Conference Today

Simultaneously Drawing Lots for Booth Locations; Construction of the Venue Nears Completion

The Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Joint Competition Conference, which has been actively preparing, will soon be completed. Participating manufacturers are preparing to sell goods. The conference venue covers 150 square zhang [a unit of area], and there are no specified levels. The location of each factory booth will be determined by drawing lots. Today at 4:00 PM, a representative conference will be held to determine the booth locations for participating manufacturers, and at the same time, a representative conference will be held to vote on the conference's procedures and publicity policies. The opening date of the conference is set for the 18th of this month, and preparations will begin on the 16th. The conference's general registration office was originally located in the Manufacturers' Association. Now, because the number of participating manufacturers is about to be full and the construction of the venue will soon be completed, all the staff have moved into the competition venue for office work from today. Participating manufacturers and inquiries about various matters related to the conference can directly contact the Penglai Market venue.

### Suzhou National Products Inspection Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

A Group of Thirty-Two People; Inspecting for One Day Before Returning

Suzhou's commerce has become increasingly prosperous in recent years, and national products have also gradually developed. In order to seek development, the local national products sector organized a national products company inspection group. Thirty-two people, including important officials of the Suzhou National Products Company, such as Zhang Yunbo, Rong Faqin, Hua Junren, Yu Jianru, and Yu Haoquan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and were accompanied by Mr. Xia Lejun of the China National Products Company United Operations Company to visit Shanghai's national products businesses. It is said that the purpose of this inspection is to focus on display layout, hospitality, and business matters. After completing the inspection yesterday, they returned to Suzhou that evening.

### Q&A on Postal Knowledge (28)

Recently, I saw several questions and answers regarding postal remittance for purchasing books in the Knowledge Column of the Guangzhou Guohua Newspaper on June 2nd of this year, stating that they were asked by Mr. Guo Yishan. Now, I will list the company's answers to this matter:

Q: I want to remit money to Shanghai to buy books because the book prices are very low. I don't know how to remit the money. Please answer the following questions: ㊀ Will the post office allow remittances of a few jiao [a unit of currency]? ㊁ If the post office does not allow it, are there any other institutions that can remit this amount? ㊂ What are the procedures for remitting money to buy books? ㊃ How can I remit money using stamps as currency?

A: ㊀㊁㊂ The post office can handle remittances. Amounts of one fen [a unit of currency] or more can be remitted by purchasing a postal money order from the post office. For details on the procedures for purchasing domestic money orders, please refer to the Q&A on Postal Knowledge in issue number 6 of this company. In addition, the post office has a method for ordering books on behalf of people. The post office has a catalog of books that can be ordered, which anyone can read. It contains detailed information on the name of each type of book, the name of the author or translator, the name of the publisher, the name of the publishing house, the publication date, the number of publications, the type of edition, how it is bound, the number of volumes in the book, the actual selling price, and the postage. If the book you want to buy is listed in that catalog, you do not need to remit money yourself. Just entrust the post office to handle it for you. The procedures are as follows: Obtain a pre-printed book purchase application form from the post office, fill it out according to the instructions, indicate what type of mail you want the purchased book to be sent by, such as airmail, registered mail, or express registered mail, and hand it over to the post office along with the book price and postage. Obtain a receipt, which is the second copy of the application form. When the purchased book is sent, the post office will send a notification slip, and you can bring the receipt to the post office to pick it up. The post office does not charge a remittance fee for the money given to the post office as the book price and postage. However, if the exchange rate from the place of application to the place of publication exceeds 2%, the excess amount will be charged. There is no exchange fee from Guangzhou to Shanghai. In addition, when receiving the book, you should check it carefully. If the book sent is not the same as the original book, you can immediately return it to the post office for return to the publisher and claim back the book price and postage you paid. If the ordered book has not been sent after three months (six months for remote provinces), the applicant can also use the original receipt to recover the book price and postage paid. The same applies if the publisher cannot send the book for some reason and returns the money.

㊃There is a postal remittance system between Guangzhou and Shanghai, so there is no need to use stamps as currency.

### Cholera Prevention Office's Public Announcement on Cholera Prevention

Prevention Methods Are Exceptionally Simple

Shanghai Cholera Prevention Temporary Office Public Announcement No. 1: ㊀ Summer has arrived again, which is the time when cholera may break out. To prevent it, this office will continue to work hard to engage in prevention. ㊁ This city and the two concessions still routinely inspect food and beverages, and all have clean tap water. For the poor, free tap water faucets are still open, or it is sold at a fair price. In the past, if cholera occurred, it usually occurred earlier in Pudong than elsewhere. In view of this, the Shanghai Municipal Government has set up a tap water authority to benefit the residents of Pudong. ㊂ Last year, the number of people who received injections was 461,354 in the Shanghai urban area, 224,036 in the Public Concession, 121,440 in the French Concession, and 15,320 in the two railway bureaus. This year, the health authorities of Shanghai and the concessions have prepared a large amount of preventive vaccines, and it is hoped that the number of people vaccinated will increase. The combined number of beds in the various epidemic hospitals is 1,030, including 180 beds in the Shanghai Municipal Hospital, 220 beds in the Public Concession Hospital, 160 beds in the French Concession Hospital, 160 beds in the Chinese Epidemic Hospital, 260 beds in the North Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital, and 50 beds in the Railway Hospital. ㊃ The first meeting of this year was held at the Municipal Government on May 14, chaired by Mr. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Health Department, and resolved various important preventive measures. On June 11, the aid epidemic group held a group meeting to compare and discuss the cholera epidemic in Calcutta, Bangkok, Saigon, Manila, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Shanghai. Calcutta has a monthly epidemic, but Bangkok and Saigon do not have a monthly epidemic. Manila has almost no epidemic. In Shanghai, it was found that most of them occurred at the end of June and July. This year, Calcutta and Bangkok have severe epidemics. From January 2nd to June 5th, there were 1,059 cases in Calcutta and 1,879 cases in Bangkok. ㊄ Research on cholera problems has made considerable progress in recent years. Two points are worth mentioning: one is that carriers of bacteria are not particularly dangerous, and the other is that suspected cholera vibrios can be transformed into the same as cholera vibrios under suitable conditions, and can kill experimental animals. ㊅ Shanghai has not had a cholera epidemic for four years, and none has been found this year. The weather is generally cool, only June 7 was suddenly hot, rising to 97 degrees Fahrenheit, and the temperature was 89.28. ㊆ The central and local health authorities hope to fundamentally eradicate cholera. However, the key to success lies in the consistent cooperation of people from all walks of life. ㊇ The prevention regulations are very simple. A summary is as follows: (A) Be careful about diet, especially raw and cold food. (B) In addition to personal vaccination, also advise family, relatives, friends, and servants to be vaccinated. (C) If you have a stomach illness, seek medical treatment immediately. If you have suspected symptoms of cholera, go to the hospital.

### Superstition Harms People, Chopping and Killing a Sick Child

He Shigen Pleads Guilty Without Denial; the Court Orders Investigation of the Truth

He Shigen, a native of Changzhou, is 32 years old and lives at No. 182 Menggu Road, Zhabei. He is a plasterer and an ignorant villager. He had four sons, all of whom died of illness. At 10:00 AM on May 7th of this year, his daughter He Laigui, who was only four years old, was dying of lung disease. He Shigen was misled by superstition, so he took He Laigui to Zhaohieli, Wuzhen Road, and chopped her to death with a kitchen knife, thinking that he could avoid the danger of losing his child from then on. The local security guard Shen Heshang found out and reported to the local court. Prosecutor Chen Jizu was appointed to examine the body and found that the deceased had chop wounds on the right corner of her forehead, the right side of her neck, and the right scapula. It was confirmed that she had been suffering from a long illness and was chopped to death. He Shigen was arrested and confessed, "Because if I raise one, one dies, I chopped him once to make a mark to see if he would be reincarnated next time, but I chopped him after he died." The official used the examination as a chop when he was dying, so he prosecuted him for homicide under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, but because the villagers were ignorant and superstitious and mistakenly violated the law, he asked for a lenient sentence to show pity. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Shanxiang opened the court. The defendant hired Lawyer Hu Yuanjun to defend him. The defendant confessed that he had given birth to three children, all of whom died of this disease, and that this child had been sick since birth. His mother also had a habit of having milk, so he hired a wet nurse, and the child also had measles. It is pitiful that my wages were all used to treat the child. I would rather go hungry. There are still parents, wives, and children in the family who depend on me to live. The child died again. According to the second landlord, a Ningbo native, if a child dies, I have to ask a Taoist to protect me. In order to save money, I took him out, saying that he was not dead, but in fact he had already died. The knife wound on the child's face was heard from people that he was a debt collector. As long as the law is broken, he will never be reincarnated again. In a moment of anger, I cut his face. There was no deception on his body. I beg your forgiveness. The court ordered a change of date to investigate the truth and interrogate again. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Using a Sturdy Figure to Impersonate a Detective and Extort Money

Xie Rongchang is Detained for Investigation

Xie Rongyuan, also known as Xia Rongchang, a Chinese police officer, No. 228, who had been removed from the French Concession patrol, lived on the upper floor of the Zhonghe Pharmacy at the intersection of Aige Road and Geluoke Road, and also opened a stove shop on Kaizi Road, living a comfortable life. However, Xie was burly and looked like a patrol detective, so he often used this opportunity to go out and impersonate a Bao Tan [a type of detective] to extort money, and his methods were so clever that he was never exposed. On the 31st of last month, he learned that Xiao Bodong (68 years old), a Cantonese owner of the Qin'an Inn at No. 156 Minguo Road, had a habit of smoking opium, so he and an accomplice took a pair of handcuffs to Xiao's place, pointing out that Xiao had privately set up a smoking den in the inn for people to smoke opium, and that the patrol had sent them to search. They handcuffed Xiao's hands, intending to take him to the patrol office for investigation. Xiao did not know it was a scam and begged to pay for a settlement. Xie initially asked for 500 yuan, but in the end agreed to 109 yuan, which was paid in full. After Xie got the money, he released Xiao and fled. The French Concession patrol learned about this and sent detectives to arrest Xie at the Xihu Bathhouse in Baxianqiao a few days ago. Xiao was summoned and Xie was mixed in with a large group of Chinese people, and Xiao was asked to identify Xie's face. It was found that Xie had also committed the same crime of intimidation and extortion in the Public Concession last year and had been sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying continued the trial in the first criminal court. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the police department, stated the case and prosecuted according to law. The defendant Xie Rongchang denied the charges and hired Lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him. The court said that the case still needed to be investigated and a new date was set for the 21st for further interrogation. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Transfer of Judges

Zhao Jixi, the chief clerk of the First Special District Court, was transferred to the Higher Court of Hebei Province. His vacancy was filled by Zha Minjian, a judge of the Civil Division of the court. Recently, the court ordered that Zha and Ni Minxiang, a judge of the Notary Office of the court, be transferred to each other. Both officials have taken up their new positions.

### Bund Constructs Flood Defenses to Withstand Huangpu High Tide

However, sewer water overflows frequently. Some suggest adding floodgates to sewers. Yesterday morning's high tide exceeded twelve feet.

The news that the Public Works Department is constructing flood defenses along the Bund's riverbank to prevent autumn floods has already been reported. Here are further details regarding the situation:

It Seems Possible to Build Defenses Against the Highest Tides

The height of the Bund's embankment is thirteen feet above the lowest tide. However, the highest tide in the Huangpu River has reached fourteen feet eight inches (according to the Dredging Bureau's records), exceeding the embankment by one foot eight inches. Therefore, the Public Works Department has stipulated that the height of the flood defenses being built along the riverbank be two feet. Thus, the height of the Bund's embankment combined with the flood defenses will be fifteen feet, which should be sufficient to withstand even a major tide exceeding fourteen feet.

Sewer Water Overflowing Causes Significant Problems

According to a certain gentleman, a reporter from Datong News Agency who is concerned about the Huangpu River's water conservancy and is usually very knowledgeable on the subject, he was asked for his opinion. He stated that the number of times the Huangpu River overflows from the embankment is very few. However, the number of times water overflows from sewers onto low-lying road surfaces is more frequent. This is because when the Huangpu River's water level exceeds eleven feet, the aforementioned low-lying sewers are likely to overflow, thus causing significant problems.

Suggestions for Prevention: Sewer Floodgates

Therefore, according to his opinion, in addition to constructing flood defenses along the riverbank, the Public Works Department should build iron floodgates that can be opened and closed in the underground sewers. When high tide is imminent, the sewer floodgates should be closed in advance. After the water level subsides slightly, they should be opened. This may be more effective than pumping stations in terms of flood prevention. This is because pumping stations can only be used to pump accumulated water off the roads after the tide has receded.

Yesterday Morning's High Tide Flooded Low-Lying Roads

Datong News Agency reporters have extracted the time and level of yesterday's Huangpu River high tide: During the high tide, sewer overflows were observed on particularly low-lying roads. Yesterday's high tide occurred at 3:20 AM, reaching a level of twelve feet one inch. This was only nine inches below the Bund's embankment height of thirteen feet and exceeded the Dredging Bureau's prediction by one foot eight inches. The reason for this was likely due to the weather and wind conditions.

### Shen Junru and Others' Defense Statement (8)

(C) The indictment also quotes the National Salvation Intelligence, which recorded the National Salvation Association's telegram to Zhang Xueliang to support the anti-Japanese resistance in Suiyuan. However, the same page of the intelligence also contains the content of the National Salvation Association's telegrams to the National Government and the Commander of the Chuan Zuo Yi Army, which were roughly the same, all urging a decisive battle against the Japanese and the dispatch of troops to support Suiyuan. The original text is available for verification and should not be arbitrarily interpreted. At that time, the situation in Suiyuan, which was being attacked by bandits and puppets, was extremely critical. The people of the country unanimously demanded that troops be dispatched to resist. The National Salvation Association also upheld its purpose of resisting the enemy and saving the country by sending telegrams to the central government and relevant parties to exert its efforts to appeal for help. Regardless of the fact that it was still at the beginning of the bandits and puppets' attack on Suiyuan and far from the Xi'an Incident, far more than the "two weeks" mentioned in the indictment, the content of each telegram had no connection whatsoever with the Xi'an Incident. Appeals for aid and the Xi'an Incident were two completely unrelated matters. If urging the dispatch of aid is considered collusion, and advocating resistance to the enemy is considered going astray, then many such documents were reported in the newspapers at the time. Are they all subject to accusations? (D) The indictment also mentions the "Private National Salvation United Association." However, the defendants, in their capacity as representatives of the National All Circles National Salvation United Association, petitioned the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and repeatedly petitioned and appealed to local authorities, as described in detail in Section 2, Item B above. How can it still be called "private"? If it is said that it was not registered, then it would be inconvenient in terms of diplomacy to approve the registration of an anti-Japanese organization. If it is not approved, it will lead to misunderstandings that hinder the anti-Japanese cause, causing unnecessary difficulties for the government and having no practical benefit. Furthermore, this is at most a procedural issue and has nothing to do with whether the defendants are guilty or not. (E) As for the issues of uniting various parties and factions, establishing an anti-Japanese regime, and advocating for the National Salvation Front, which are also involved in the indictment, they have already been explained in detail in Section 3, Section 2, and Section 4 above and need not be repeated. In Section 9, the indictment accuses the defendants of colluding with the military for sending telegrams requesting troops to aid Suiyuan, holds the defendants, who have been detained for two weeks, responsible for a sudden incident, and considers others' requests for the defendants' release as evidence of the defendants' guilt, determining that the defendants organized groups with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China and promoted doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. This is a deliberate attempt to incriminate people and is completely unfounded. (F) Section 10 of the indictment claims that Luo Qing participated in a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, implicating Nai Qi and also Junru and Taofen. Here, we will respond to the parts of Section 2 and Section 5 of the indictment that involve Luo Qing and Nai Qi together. (A) Section 10 of the indictment states, "Luo Qing admitted that he was responsible for organizing the Jiangsu All Circles National Salvation United Association." Section 5 states, "The defendants, because he had expressed support for the National Salvation Association, had Zhang Naiqi give the reactionary publication to Luo Qing, ordering him to be responsible for organizing the Jiangsu All Circles National Salvation United Association." Naiqi never ordered Luo Qing to be responsible for organizing any National Salvation Association, and the National Salvation Association never sent anyone out to organize any groups. Any National Salvation Association that was established elsewhere was organized voluntarily by the local people. Unless they came to the National Salvation Association to request to join, there was no relationship with the National Salvation Association. If the prosecutor wants to find out whether Naiqi ordered Luo Qing to be responsible for organizing the association, he should investigate the facts. How can he rely solely on Luo Qing's one-sided statement? Furthermore, even Luo Qing has never made such a statement. When the prosecutor asked, "Did he want you to organize the Jiangsu All Circles National Salvation United Association?" he replied, "Yes, I contacted him once, and he agreed to my proceeding with the Jiangsu All Circles National Salvation United Association" (see the investigative record of January 19, 1937). Later, when asked, "Did Tong Naiqi want you to organize the Jiangsu All Circles National Salvation United Association?" he replied, "He didn't tell me to organize it, I organized it myself, but I got his consent and contacted him" (see the investigative record of March 4, 1937). In his application to stop detention submitted during the investigation, he also stated, "The petitioner is engaged in the National Salvation Movement and has not joined its established organization. Regarding the National All Circles National Salvation United Association, he only had one private contact with Zhang Naiqi, the person in charge. Apart from theory and policy, their actions rarely involved each other and were even separated" (see page 103 of the first volume of the investigation). That is, even Luo Qing's statement and confession do not contain the statement that Naiqi ordered him to be responsible for organizing the association. (B) Sections 2, 5, and 10 of the indictment all involve Naiqi handing over printed documents to Luo Qing. When Luo Qing came to meet him, Naiqi gave him three types of printed materials because he asked for them: "Declaration of the National All Circles National Salvation United Association," "Political Program," and "Several Basic Conditions and Minimum Requirements for Group Defense Against Insults." As for the printed documents seized at the Jiangyin Hotel where he was staying when he was arrested, "Letter from the Communist Party to the Kuomintang" and Mao Zedong's mimeographed letter, they were not handed over by Naiqi. Think about it, all the printed documents in Naiqi's home were searched and taken away by the Municipal Public Security Bureau personnel at the time of his arrest and are still in the case file. However, there are no two types of documents in them. Furthermore, it is too implausible and fundamentally unbelievable to say that such documents would be casually handed over to a stranger whom he met for the first time. (C) Section 10 of the indictment also states that Luo Qing confessed, "Shen Junru and Zou Taofen were also present when I contacted Zhang Naiqi." However, this is not the case. Junru did not meet him at Naiqi's home, and Taofen never even went to the house where Naiqi was living at the time, so there was no possibility of them meeting. Xiao Naiqi moved into that house in September of last year, only one month before Luo Qing's visit. The indictment claims that Junru and Taofen happened to meet Luo Qing at Naiqi's home, but this is a trivial matter. If it were not contrary to the facts, why would it be brought up for rebuttal? In Sections 1, 5, and 10, the indictment ignores Luo Qing's clear confession that he voluntarily organized the Jiangsu All Circles National Salvation Association, arbitrarily claims that it was ordered by Naiqi, relies on Luo Qing's one-sided statement, strongly accuses Naiqi of handing over printed materials such as the Communist Party's letter, and believes that Junru and Taofen also met him. It is clear that this is a deliberate attempt to fabricate charges. Based on the above statements, it can be seen that the defendants are engaged in national salvation work, nothing more than seeking unity throughout the country to resist foreign insults. This is not inconsistent with the government's consistent policies and current measures. The indictment does not clarify the purpose of the National Salvation Association and the government's national policies. None of the ten pieces of criminal evidence listed can be established. Therefore, we dare to truthfully present the above, hoping that your esteemed court will conduct a fair trial, render a judgment according to law, declare us innocent, clear the injustice, uphold justice, and grant us the suspension of detention so that we can appeal and defend ourselves outside, which would be in the public interest. We respectfully submit this to the Jiangsu High Court.

### The Truth About the Kidnapping Case on the Xiangyang Maru is Revealed: The Main Culprit Has Been Arrested

Wang Lanfang is a Dan actor at the New Stage. She was arrested while dressed as the White Snake. Seven male and female kidnappers were sent to the court for trial.

Customs water police and detectives, together with investigators from the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, cracked a kidnapping case on the Japanese Nisshin Company's Japanese ship Xiangyang Maru in Hongkou the day before yesterday. Three suspects from Jiangbei, Li Zengshan, Ding Yucai, and Shi Jingyuan, along with four kidnapped Jiangbei women, Chen Lanying, Chen Xiaoshanzi, Zhou Zhaodi, and Wang Erxiu, were taken back for questioning. The details were published in yesterday's newspaper. The detectives in charge of this case were not afraid to ask for details and interrogated the suspects separately. Chen Lanying, one of the women, was eloquent and did not seem like a textile factory worker. She claimed to be siblings with Chen Xiaoshanzi, but they looked different. A torn and incomplete bill of sale was found on Li, which, when pieced together, showed that Wang Lanfang had signed it. Li insisted that Chen Lanying knew about this. Based on these three suspicions, the detectives repeatedly questioned Chen Lanying. Although Lanying was eloquent, she was clearly embarrassed. Chen Xiaoshanzi pointed out in person that she was not her sister. At this point, Lanying knew it was difficult to hide and confessed the truth, claiming her real name was Zheng Jinmei. She pretended to be Chen Xiaoshanzi's sister and used the name Chen Lanying. She worked at the Japanese China Textile Factory as a child. Two years ago, she was forced by her adoptive parent to break her virginity with a certain person from Shandong, who has since passed away. She is now having an affair with Wang Lanfang, a 26-year-old from Baoying who is a Dan actor at the New Stage Huaiyang Theater on Linping Road in Zhabei. This matter was initiated by Wang, who ordered me to lure several women out and sell them to the three suspects, Li, etc., with whom she is acquainted, which would yield huge profits. Later, a woman named Wang Erxiu, who had just come to Shanghai from Suzhou, went to the theater to ask the actor Tang Jinbiao for money. I learned that she had been abandoned by her husband, so I tricked her into going to Hankou to work and hid her in a hotel. Later, I went to the Xiaomuqiao shed in Yangshupu and lured out two acquaintances, Chen Xiaoshanzi and Zhou Zhaodi, who were textile factory workers at Yong'an. I also said that they would go to Hankou to work and could get higher wages. The three women were all hidden in the Sanyi Hotel near McGon Road. Wang raped Chen Xiaoshanzi once and then entrusted Tang Desheng and his wife Tang Zhang, from Haimen, to monitor them day and night. After negotiating the price with the three suspects, Li, etc., Wang wrote a receipt and handed them over to Li, etc., to take on the ship. The previous statement that they would be taken to Anqing was also false. In fact, there is no flower tax in the Xi'an area, so they took a boat to Hankou and then took a train to sell them there. Detectives Zhu Yaoshan and Shi Ajin rushed to No. 1480 Xinzha Road in the Public Concession and arrested the guards, Tang Desheng and his wife. At 9:00 PM, Detective Wang Haiquan and Zheng Jinmei were dispatched to the New Stage to arrest the main suspect, Wang Lanfang. However, since it was the Dragon Boat Festival, the theater was performing the entire White Snake Legend that evening. Wang was playing the main role of the White Snake in the play. She had already finished her makeup, dressed beautifully, and was about to go on stage. The detectives, together with the police chief of the police station, walked into the theater and arrested Wang backstage. The audience in the front hall suddenly heard that the White Snake had been arrested, and the fake play became real, which surprised everyone. The role of Bai was temporarily replaced by another actor. In order to avoid chaos in the theater, the detectives ordered Wang to remove her costume, exit through the back door, and take her back to the police station. When she saw that all the suspects in the case had been arrested, she knew it was difficult to deny, so she directly admitted the crime. The head of the police believed that Zheng Quanmei was instigated by the main culprit to commit this illegal act, so she was also listed as a defendant. Zhou An'di's husband, Zhou Dasi, and Chen Xiaoshanzi's brother-in-law, Kuai Maokuan, were also summoned. Yesterday afternoon, the seven male and female defendants were sent to the local court for trial.

### Fraudulent Film Company Sentenced for Fraud

Ma Guangyao Sentenced to Four Months

Ma Guangyao, a native of Shaoxing residing at No. 13, Lane 118, Fuxu Road, opened the Jinlong Film Company at No. 6, Quanfu Lane, No. 301, Chengdu Road, in April of this year. He posted advertisements in newspapers to recruit messengers and tea boys and also recruited male and female film trainees. At that time, more than ten people, including Zhang Wenfu, Yu Rongyi, Xu Zixian, Liu Hanqing, Chen Zixiang, Yan Riyi, Huang GuangKang, Ye Yutang, Tang Feng, Zhang Da, Zhu Wenyuan, Xi Lin Zhao Yun, and Li Aina, applied for the job or became trainees. However, they all paid a considerable deposit, ranging from 30 yuan to 1 yuan and 2 jiao. Before a month had passed, the Jinlong Film Company closed down, and Ma Wenyang fled without a trace. Zhang Wenfu and others jointly reported the case to the Chengdu Road Police Station. On the 3rd of the month, Chinese detective Sun Wenxi and detective Zhang Kuidong arrested Ma at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road and sent him to the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, the police station's lawyer, prosecuted him for fraud. Under questioning, he was remanded for further investigation. Yesterday, Judge Ye Shengchao continued the trial in the second criminal court. Ma Wenyang still confessed that the deposits were collected by Lu Tingfang, the owner of the Jinlong Company. He only took over from Lu on May 20 and closed down due to poor business. Judge Ye verified the confession and sentenced Ma Guangyao to four months of imprisonment for fraud to serve as a warning.

### Zhou Yongkang Sentenced to Twelve Years for Drug Trafficking

Zhou Yongkang, a local, was found to be carrying 105 small packets of heroin at around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, intending to sell them somewhere. He was found by Chinese patrol officer No. 1588 near Bazilu North Jiangxi Road, who suspected his behavior. He was stopped and the heroin was found on the spot and taken to the Hongkou Police Station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, recounted the previous events. The Chinese patrol officer then testified about the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant. The heroin was presented for examination. The defendant stammered in his confession. Judge Xiao sentenced Zhou Yongkang to twelve years of imprisonment, and the heroin was confiscated.

### Shanghai Literature Exhibition: Exhibits From Various Regions Shipped to Shanghai

Organizing Committee to Hold Meeting Tomorrow Afternoon

The Shanghai Literature Exhibition has been reported in various newspapers since its preparation began. Although the collection of exhibits is limited to one city and ten counties, the scope of the solicitation is almost national. Various regions regard Shanghai as a major port in the country and a focus of attention for various countries. Therefore, once it is launched, not only people from the ten counties will come forward to help, but also famous libraries and private collectors from various regions will enthusiastically collect exhibits. For example, Hangzhou and other places have also formed solicitation committees to discuss the methods of collecting exhibits. Various old families in the city, such as the Yao, Cao, Li, and Qin families, have also sorted out a large number of exhibits.

### Film Industry Union's Executive and Supervisory Committees Take Office Yesterday

Zhou Jianyun Elected Chairman; Approved Negotiations on the New Earth Case

The Shanghai Film Production Industry Association held a swearing-in ceremony for the executive and supervisory committees at the Pudong Building at 5:00 PM yesterday and held the first executive committee meeting. The details are as follows:

Election of Officers

The association held a swearing-in ceremony yesterday. More than 10 people, including He Yuanming, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and committee members Zhang Shichuan, Tao Bosun, and Zhou Jianyun, were sworn in. The first executive committee meeting was held, and Zhou Jianyun was elected chairman. The election of officers was held first. As a result of the vote, Zhang Shankun, Wu Bangfan, Shao Zuiweng, Zhou Jianyun, Zhang Shichuan, Zhang Yusheng, and Tao Bosun were elected as standing committee members. Then, the standing committee members elected one chairman from among themselves. As a result, Zhou Jianyun was elected. The heads of each department will be elected at the next meeting after the office rules are determined.

Resolutions

The following resolutions were passed: (1) Negotiations on the New Earth case, a film co-produced by Japan and Germany that humiliated China: It was resolved that (A) the Ministry of Propaganda and the Municipal Government should be requested to negotiate strictly, and (B) letters should be sent to the German Consul General and the Film Inspection Committee of the Public Works Department to inquire about the matter. (2) The Foreign Film Association came to the meeting to discuss holding talks to strengthen ties: It was resolved to hand it over to the Standing Committee. (3) The association had previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Propaganda requesting recognition of the Cantonese films in South China: It was resolved to approve the recognition. (4) The Shanxi Rongjin Donghai three major theaters sent a letter requesting an increase of one jiao per seat during the summer vacation: It was resolved to hand it over to the Standing Committee. (5) It was resolved to hire Ren Jinping as the secretary-general of the association.

Negotiations on the New Earth

Regarding the negotiations on the New Earth, the association passed two letters: (1) To the German Consul General in Shanghai: This film, "The New Earth" (TheNewOearth), produced by Japan, is full of military aggression and humiliating colors to us. According to the publicity, this film is a co-production between your country and Japan. Although this publicity is one-sided, we have not heard your country deny it. Our association is based on the fact that your country's leader Hitler recently met with our country's special envoy Kong Xiangxi, expressing concern for the health of our country's leader General Chiang Kai-shek and praising the prosperity of economic development, as well as the history of friendly relations between our two countries. We would like to ask again whether your country has fully approved the plot of this film co-produced with Japan and whether it is based on your country's position. This matter is of great importance to the relations between the two countries. Please reply in detail. (2) To the Film Inspection Committee of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession: Your committee has always paid attention to the deletion of plots that may cause international resentment or misunderstanding when inspecting films. The members of our association deeply understand the intention of your committee and often tolerate and accept it. Even for the deletions that go beyond this scope, we often remain silent. Now, under your committee's inspection, the premiere of the film "New Earth" is surprising. We do not know whether your committee has already gone through the procedures of inspection and deletion for this film and obtained the approval for performance. Please provide a detailed reply on the facts and attach a copy of the inspection regulations for research.

### Suggestion to Commemorate the Buddha's Birthday on the Full Moon Day of May

Tai Xu Suggests the Buddhist Association

The Buddhist community in our country has been arguing about the date of Shakyamuni Buddha's birthday. Some say that the bathing Buddha festival should be on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month according to the abandoned lunar calendar, while others say that the bathing Buddha festival should be changed to the eighth day of the fourth month of the national calendar. According to the opinion provided by Buddhist leader Master Taixu to the Chinese Buddhist Association, it is roughly stated that the bathing Buddha festival on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month should be the established practice in our country for the birth of Sakyamuni. However, Ceylon, Tibet, and various countries in Southeast Asia and the West have changed the full moon day of September in the solar calendar as the memorial day. If our country joins as one of the world's Buddhist countries, this day should also be used as the world's Buddhist memorial day to hold a suitable time for the opening ceremony. The Chinese Buddhist Association believes that this opinion is very important and will be discussed and adopted.

### Shanghai County Government Investigates Descendants of Local Worthies

And Solicits Funds for the Local Worthies Shrine

Yesterday, the Shanghai County Government, with Instruction No. 2702, directed all district offices, stating: "Recently, a letter was received from the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and Jiangsu Local Worthies Shrine Construction Committee stating that the construction of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and Jiangsu Local Worthies Shrine concerns the entire province.

### American and British Timber Shipped to Shanghai

Shipping Costs Double Due to Vessel Shortage

Since the resolution of the strike by American sailors, the shipping costs for timber from Washington State and British Columbia in America to Shanghai have doubled due to a shortage of ships. That is, the cost has increased from 8.5 yuan to 16 yuan per ten feet. The shipping costs from Japan to Hong Kong have also increased proportionally according to the above price standard. This is because the number of ships sailing in the Pacific Ocean recently is insufficient, while the goods waiting to be transported, such as timber, steel rails, and scrap iron, are extremely congested. Furthermore, the charter prices for ships by various merchants have also risen. Many ships originally destined for Europe are showing a tendency to change course to the Pacific to seek increased profits. It is now known that three ships are planning to make one trip at the beginning of summer.

### Dispute Over Raffle at Improved Household Exhibition

The Improved Household Exhibition has been open for two weeks now. Yesterday (the 14th) at around 2:00 PM, Chen Qinglin went to visit. Seeing that there were many raffle stalls, Mr. Chen drew a small box of Luopai fruit salt at stall number 24. To his surprise, upon opening it, he found a wooden block inside. Mr. Chen immediately argued with them. Unexpectedly, the Russian woman at the stall, angered by the leak of the secret, became enraged and called on an American man named Kltz, an employee of the Old Jinlong Foreign Firm on Suzhou River Road, who beat Mr. Chen severely without asking the reason, causing him injury. The tourists in the entire area gathered to argue, almost leading to a major disaster. Later, the Western police transferred him to the Chengdu Road Police Station. The police station, due to consular jurisdiction, did not handle the matter. Mr. Chen then went to the First Special District Local Court Procuratorate to verify the injuries. It is also heard that Mr. Chen plans to file a complaint with the American Consulate.

### Fu Wenhao Robbery Suspect Cites Bo Wenwei as Witness

Claims He Never Came to Shanghai Last July. Police Refuse to Investigate, Making it Hard to Accept

Lin Chuanyao, a Cantonese man with higher education who is currently working in an agency in Nanjing, recently came to Shanghai for leisure. AA, a famous socialite and former movie star from Sichuan named Chuan Wenhao, who lives at No. 72 Albert Road in the French Concession, reported him to the French Police, accusing him of leading a gang armed with weapons to rob her house of valuables worth over 7,000 yuan on the morning of July 21st last year. He was arrested and sent to the Third Special Court for interrogation and detention for investigation. These details have been reported in previous issues of the newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying from the Second Special Court visited the Criminal Division 1 to interrogate. The plaintiff, represented by lawyer Wen Chao, filed an incidental civil suit. Because police lawyer Gu Shouxi claimed that the police's investigation of the case was not concluded, he requested another week's postponement, so it was not presented. During the court's interrogation, Lin Chuanyao testified that he came to Shanghai on the 18th of last month and stayed with relatives and friends. For ethical reasons, it was inconvenient to disclose the names of the relatives and friends to avoid implicating innocent people. The key point of the case is not whether he had a residence during this trip to Shanghai. Rather, it is whether the defendant participated in the robbery at the plaintiff's house when it was robbed. The plaintiff pointed out that the defendant rented a pavilion room at the plaintiff's house on July 16th last year and later invited robbers to enter and commit the robbery. However, the defendant had not come to Shanghai last year. His whereabouts in July last year can be proved by Central Committee member Bo Wenwei. However, the police refused to investigate, making it hard for him to accept. He had absolutely no involvement in the robbery. He also retained lawyer Ma Leming to defend him. After verifying the statements, the court decided to reschedule the hearing for the morning of the 21st and the defendant was returned to custody.

### Muo Changwang's Autopsy Reveals Ruptured Intestines and Spleen

Three Workers Accused of Manslaughter - Family Files Civil Suit for 2,000 Yuan

Mu Changwang, a man from Taizhou who was 20 years old, was a worker in the fine yarn room of the Yufeng Yarn Factory, a Japanese-owned factory at No. 2866 Yangshupu Road. On the 20th of May, at around 7:00 PM, he was dragged by his fellow workers Gong Zhaolu, Li Jinfu, and Cao Changshan into a dressing room, where they forcibly stripped his pants. Mu resisted with all his might and suffered injuries to his abdomen. At around 3:00 AM that night, he shouted in pain, complaining of a stomach ache. He was sent by rickshaw to the Yufeng workshop on Dinghai Road for treatment, but died. Gong and the other two paid for a coffin and arranged for the funeral, carrying it to a wasteland in Jiangjiabang, Huade Road for temporary burial. Later, his fellow-countryman Dong Debao, who was in charge of meals, notified the deceased's father, Senxiang, who came to Shanghai from his hometown. He asked Gong Zhaolu and others to pay 100 yuan to settle the matter, but failed. He reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station. As it concerned human life, the Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to the Yufeng Yarn Factory to arrest Gong, Li, and Cao and detain them in the First Special Court. Mu Changwang's coffin was transported to the corpse examination site on Feilun Road to open the coffin for examination, awaiting a forensic autopsy. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Bianfen visited the Criminal Division 3 to continue the interrogation. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that according to the forensic examination, Mu's intestines and spleen were ruptured. This kind of injury is caused by strong pressure or squeezing of the abdomen. They are now prosecuting for manslaughter. The deceased's father, Mu Senxiang, in the civil suit, demanded that the defendants and Yin A'er and the other four people compensate all expenses totaling 2,000 yuan. Questioned, the three defendants testified that the incident was due to playfulness, leading to this disaster. Yin A'er was not seen at the scene. They asked for leniency. Judge Xiao ruled to return them to custody and reschedule for further review.

Spring and Autumn
— Like a Shadow

American aesthetics use the faces and figures of women to represent the word "beauty." This is the beauty of the flesh, not the beauty of the spirit.

The beauty of the flesh is something everyone sacrifices for in love. But when beauty fades and love wanes, it's like an autumn fan discarded. This is called a flaw in beauty.

The beauty of the spirit is fixed, permanent, and resides not in appearance but in morality. Moral beauty, beauty within, has the potential to overthrow all other beauty and be passed down forever.

Therefore, a tender hand cannot compare to Liang Hongyu's hand that beats the drum to aid the war effort. A face like a lotus cannot compare to Hua Mulan's face that faces the blade's edge. A beauty that could topple cities and states cannot compare to Xun Guan's rescue mission to break the siege and defend the nation.

Especially in the current situation, with powerful neighbors harboring ambitions, the beauty of Wang Zhaojun cannot bring peace. With lost territory yet to be recovered, the beauty of Sun Shangxiang cannot be used to entice. With the League of Nations involved, the beauty of Diao Chan cannot be used for espionage. Bearing humiliation and enduring insult, with national shame yet to be wiped away, the beauty of Xi Shi cannot be used for revenge.

I hope that all female compatriots across the country will break away from modern beauty, believe in true beauty, and perhaps become sacred among beauties. (Zhang Huaqiao)

### The Age of Mechanization

— Fang Zheng

On the shafts of our Chinese calligraphy brushes, there are always carved a few very upright small characters. It is said that carving these characters is very troublesome, and unless you have done a considerable amount of research, you absolutely cannot carve them! To understand the truth, last winter, through the introduction of a friend, I was able to visit the production department of a brush factory. What they call "troublesome" is indeed true, because it is already not easy to carve a small character on a brush shaft, let alone consider making it upright and beautiful! Therefore, it is said that carving one character takes one or two minutes, but only for "skilled workers," and beginners cannot do it. At that time, I felt that if there were a character carving machine, wouldn't that be very convenient and fast?

However, the evolution of matter surpasses everything, and the so-called "mechanization" is a sign of this era. Therefore, in the film "Modern Times," there is even the trick of using machines for eating, although it is satirized a bit too much, but in this ever-changing era, who dares to guarantee that it will not be invented and adopted by humans in the future? Isn't that right? I used to think that a character carving machine was just a fantasy, but now someone has actually invented it and it has appeared in our great Shanghai.

Last week, my colleague Mr. Huang and I went to a giant store to buy fountain pens. After we selected them, the clerk asked us if we wanted to engrave our names. Driven by curiosity, we finally agreed. The clerk then took out a piece of white paper the size of pressed tofu and asked Mr. Huang to sign his name himself. Mr. Huang also complied and handed in the paper. Afterwards, I saw the clerk put the strip of paper on a character carving machine that looked like scales, and also put the pen in a machine about a foot away from the paper. Then, he turned on the electricity, took a long needle on the machine with one hand, and gently pierced the strokes of the writing. When he finished piercing, we still thought it had nothing to do with the pen, but when the pen was taken out, the three characters "Huang ××" were already on it, and the pen marks were exactly the same, which was incomparable to the situation of carving characters on Chinese calligraphy brushes.

On the way back, I praised the greatness of mechanical power! But I also sighed that the status of mankind will be in danger of being taken away!

### Training an Eagle

— 19

Two well-meaning friends climbed a tall tree to search for bird nests, and surprisingly, they didn't come back empty-handed. They captured six eaglets. Afterwards, they acted as the mother eagle, busy every day trying to fish and buy pork, fulfilling their feeding responsibilities. One day, while catching frogs in the field, they almost got arrested by the police patrol team.

Another well-meaning me, seeing them so dedicated to feeding, asked: "Will these eaglets be worth money when they grow up?" Hearing this, they became very excited and told me the following.

They said that they didn't want to sell them for money, nor were they raising them for fun, but to raise them to catch pheasants and the like. However, eagles are difficult to tame, so they must first undergo some training. In the last week of training, the trainer and the trainee are extremely tired, having to stay awake for seven days and seven nights! The trainer orders the trainee to hide on his forearm, circling in the room day and night. The person cannot close his eyes, and the eagle cannot be allowed to close its eyes either. Only then is the training considered complete, and the eagle can serve its master.

The master goes out to catch pheasants, etc., holding a wooden staff in his hand, followed by a yellow dog, and an eagle hiding on his arm. When it is time to use the eagle, he stretches out his arm with force, and it will flap its wings and fly away, seeking the object that its master desires. Don't look down on this arm stretch, it takes seventy or eighty catties of strength to control this eagle!

It is also said that once an eagle is tamed, it will not escape halfway. And it will never forget the taste of an animal's blood after it has eaten it. It can serve its master with its sense of smell, sight, and without fail. The master's arm, because it is often hooked by the eagle's claws, has skin as firm as iron.

According to the story of Li Si facing punishment, wanting to lead a yellow dog and hold a gray eagle to leave Shangcai was impossible, which proves that the custom of raising eagles has existed since ancient times.

Modern culture has a tendency to move entirely to the southeast, and the beauty of the southeast lies especially in the three Wu areas. I, your humble servant, traveled to Suzhou and met the famous calligrapher Mr. Liu Ran, and saw that the peaches and plums under his door were truly numerous. Before the seat, letters from students asking about art were piled high. Recently, due to the requests of friends at sea, Mr. Liu specially established a branch in Shanghai to facilitate face-to-face instruction. The number of places is limited, and the tuition fee is not willing to be too high. (The current registration place is temporarily designated at the Shenxin General Company on Jiangxi Road, at Mr. Rong Yaosong's place. Telephone number 19620.) (Lin Zhipeng)

### Changing Nests, Mating Phoenixes

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter 14 (Wax Tears String Perfumed Curtains, Bid Farewell to Good Dreams, Jade Face Grows Thin, Water Pavilion Mourns Withered Glory)

Yashi pressed his hands on his chest, gave a slight bow, and smiled: "Ms. Jiang, you heard what Auntie said just now. Indeed, I'm a little tipsy now." Menglan said: "Well then, please go and rest, Mr. Liu." Yashi stood a few feet away, looking at her face directly. He stayed there for about two or three minutes, nodded with a smile, and went to close the door himself. Then he went back to the bride, sat down across the table. He had brought a bit of a smile, looking at the bride. Stealing a glance at the bride, he saw her sitting upright, without a trace of a smile on her face, so he could say what her attitude was. Naturally, the bride was shy, and her attitude was always solemn. However, besides being solemn, this bride also had a hint of resentment between her brows and eyes. Therefore, Yashi's smile also faded. He whispered: "Miss Jiang, you look a little unhappy. Are you dissatisfied with our marriage?" Menglan gave a slight curtsy and smiled: "You're taking it too seriously." Yashi said: "Otherwise, why do you look so unhappy?" Menglan smiled: "That's your misunderstanding. I'm actually a little ashamed..." When the word "ashamed" reached Yashi's ears, his heart suddenly jumped, and he couldn't help but stand up, widened his eyes, and asked: "What? You're a little ashamed? What do you have to be ashamed of?" Menglan smiled: "There's nothing out of the ordinary. You don't need to be alarmed." Yashi sat down again, still looking at her. Menglan said: "The word 'ashamed' that I said is not detrimental to my personality." Saying this, she put away the hint of a smile, and straightened her face again. Yashi said: "Then please tell me." Menglan knew that his eyes were shining, enveloping her whole body, but she pretended not to know, turned her head slightly, and looked at the pair of flower candles on the table. She saw the wax dripping down like wine from a wine strainer, forming threads. The small copper dish below, collecting the wax, was already full of solidified wax. She stared at it for a long time, forgetting to answer. Yashi shook the table a couple of times across the table, and asked with a smile: "You said you'd tell me the reason, why aren't you talking?" Menglan said: "It's not that I won't tell you, it's just that I'm afraid you won't believe me after I tell you." Yashi said: "It's something that's not related to your personality, so it must be a trivial matter. Just tell me, that's all." Menglan said: "What do you think of my body?" Yashi suddenly heard this, and of course was a little puzzled, so he bent his arms and placed them on the table, leaned forward slightly, looked at her, and said: "Your body looks very good." (983)

### Knowing How to Calculate

— Liang Neng

People who know how to calculate can always take advantage, or at least won't suffer losses.

For example, when the weather gets hot! Some families suffer from diseases due to unclean living conditions, resulting in a lot of medical expenses! Families who know how to calculate, however, know to buy some stinky disinfectant early, and sprinkle it around the house every day to kill harmful insects and bacteria, so they won't get infected with diseases and spend a lot of medical expenses.

However, the effectiveness of stinky disinfectant is very important. Generic stinky disinfectant is not as effective as the standard, and its disinfecting power is not enough.

Therefore, people who know how to calculate like to use "Arlene Stinky Disinfectant" because "Arlene Stinky Disinfectant" has sufficient effectiveness, exceeding the prescribed standards, and has a particularly strong disinfecting power. It has been selling for more than twenty years, and sales are getting better and better. And Wuzhou Pharmacy is currently holding a summer giveaway event. If you go to buy it these days, you can also get practical free gifts.

### Talking About Eyes

— Shaodong

The main function of the eye is not only as a visual organ, but also to convey emotions. The structure of the eye is very delicate and sensitive. For this reason, damage from external objects can easily occur at any time. Conjunctivitis, swollen eyelids, photophobia, tearing... these eye diseases are very contagious, and if treatment is delayed, there is a risk of blindness.

"Mingming Eye Drops" can cure all kinds of eye diseases. They are made using scientific methods and refined Chinese medicine. They are effective quickly and without any irritation. They feel comfortable and cool when dropped into the eyes, and the bottle is novel and easy to use. Because I know its effectiveness well, I am happy to talk about it.

### Short News

Wuzhou Pharmacy has a new "Liangdan Gourd" available, with an exquisite style that can be carried around. It can be used for both enjoyment and treating illnesses.

Travel Notes

### A Record of the Book Boat of Wuxing

— By Shen Yiliu

The lake district receives the spiritual essence of the Five Lakes, connects the throat of western Zhejiang, and silkworms and mulberry trees breed its abundant resources. The lakes and mountains nurture its elites. As a great river and heavenly prefecture, it is the most beautiful in the southeast. When China speaks of wealth and abundance, it must mention Jiangdong, and among the regions of Wu and Yue, the lake district is especially the first to be recommended. Civilization creates, building on past achievements and adding to their splendor, and its benefits are truly not limited to fish and salt. Since the rise of the Han Dynasty, it has long been known for its wealth, and those who survey the trends of China can find their direction here. Its land has a pleasant climate, and fish and rice are plentiful, which is the time of heaven; the mountains send forth green, and clear ripples encircle the jade, which is the spirit of the land; clouds and cranes compare their postures, and eyebrows and eyes are like paintings, which is the contribution of the people. At a time when the rich spring is just passing and the new green is just growing plump, the Prefect of Fengyi, with his official duties light and idle, abandoned his residence without a companion, sent a swift invitation to a guest, and made a tour around Tai Lake. Having exhausted the scenic spots of Yuyang and Yuanzhu, he went down to the Huan Yuan Pavilion, passed the Wanqing Hall, and entered the Yangxian Grotto Heaven. Half of the dust from his collar dissipated, and his heroic spirit was not yet satisfied. He went out of the Sea King Hall and looked at the mountains in the southeast, which were covered with rising clouds, and he was suddenly lost in thought. He raised his cup and said to his guest, "There is a great and beautiful place here. Why not follow me for a visit?" He immediately commanded the whirlwind chariot to rush towards it. Liezi rode the wind, and Master Hu could shrink the earth; before the rice was cooked, the envoy had arrived. Leaning on the majestic, towering pavilion, he stretched out and whistled, and his eyes were greatly opened. The Taoist site stretched out before him, and white sparrows covered it from behind. The blue waves of the lake encircled it like a mirror floating in the universe, and the setting sun shone on it, creating a myriad of forms. The weeping willows surrounded the sky, and the first fragrance arose, startling a glimpse of a phoenix. The painted boats had just passed. The Prefect was greatly pleased and said, "My old man is rambling about, and my mood is not shallowly revived. Where can I find a Peach Blossom Spring and take a boat on the Wuling River?" He left and returned, walking along the stream. A painted boat waited for the tide, and the hair of a Sui Dynasty maiden had not yet been gathered. Peeking slightly, there was a beautiful woman who lifted the curtain to greet the guest. He knocked and boarded the boat. With a soft oar stroke, the sound of oars slowly began. Gradually turning, the groves and pavilions became sparse, and layers of reeds surrounded them on all sides. Rowing towards the depths of the misty waves, suddenly a sweet voice came from behind him, saying, "Has the guest had tea yet?" The gazes of all turned back, and beauty was before them. Her hair shone brightly, and she was fresh as the morning light, with the dreams of yesterday not yet melted away. She presented her white teeth slightly, with the scent of tea in her sleeves, as she served tea to the guest. After a cup entered his mouth, all of his worries were dispelled. He asked for another cup, and she blushed. Collecting her clothes, she slowly retreated. When he tried to hold her, she fluttered away, her charming gaze turned several times, and the aftertaste lingered. In a daze, a clear song arose outside the window. Pushing open the window, he saw swallows skimming and orioles flitting, and floating clouds in disorder. The sound of the oars mingled with the song, like a yellow oriole coming out of a valley, harmonious and orderly. Her willow waist twisted slightly, like a flying swallow in the palm of his hand, about to leave in the wind. In the instant of turning her head for a glance, her spirit was flying, and the light of the waves was flowing, as if to stir up the sunken scales and bring down the flying feathers. He regretted that he could not raise up a disciple of Qu Yuan to ask her about it. Passing through White Sparrow Pond, the water was as green as oil, and a single strand of silk seemed to be a fairy crane flying from beyond the heavens. Suddenly the oar’s momentum lightened, and a delicate breath blew like orchids. After a short while, she stirred the ashes in the stove and re-boiled fresh water, washing away the dust for the mad guest in the snow, which was no different from a woodcutter understanding the language of flowers. Thereupon, he warmly inquired about the girl's background. Living on the Bi Lake, she had long been familiar with the misty waves. She was a descendant of a Wuling fairy, her name was E'e, and she was the youngest daughter of the King of Huo. Her eyebrows had not yet been trimmed, and her jade plate rolled like pearls. Her clear words were like dew in the wind. It was as if he had met Qin Cao in meditation and Chao Yun setting a tune. His far-reaching thoughts were not continued, and the first stage of meditation turned desolate. The Prefect arose with a start and said: This is enough to cleanse the lungs and liver, why use the Five Stone Powder! He wrote an impromptu poem with a plain brush: "The water before Vermilion Bird Mountain is like silk, the moth eyebrows beat the oar without reluctance; the soul-stirring willows by the Bi Lake, the southern breeze brings the lingering songs." Short dreams are like dust, and the song of horses is in the water. The heartless returning oar breaks the longing. With a sound of "take care," he vaguely saw the light silk covering the traces of tears.

### Two Great Discoveries in Astronomy and Botany

— By Jiaoxin

㊀ A Comet That Passes the Earth Every 300,000 Years

According to Dr. Davidson, President of the British Astronomical Association, a comet has appeared near the tail of the Big Dipper. This comet passed the Earth during the earliest prehistoric era, and has only now returned to visit us again. Dr. Davidson, while attending the Association's meeting in London, presented a model of this comet to the audience, indicating its trajectory in relation to the Earth and the Sun. According to Dr. Davidson's calculations, it returns to the vicinity of the Earth approximately every 300,000 years. This timeframe is roughly similar to that of "Peking Man" as determined by anthropologists. "Peking Man" is the oldest known human species in the world. After this appearance, it will take another 300,000 years before it appears again. According to Professor Tai Wenbo of the Carnegie Institute, humans may be extinct by then because humans concentrate too much on the development of mental power, they may not be able to survive after 300,000 years. This comet, which appears every 300,000 years, was discovered by the American astronomer Whipple, and is therefore called "Whipple's Comet." However, the observations on which Dr. Davidson based his age estimates are largely the work of two great British literary figures: Dr. Stevenson and Mr. He. Mr. He is also a famous British comedy writer and director. This comet is currently 124 million miles from Earth and can only be seen with a telescope. It was closest to Earth on June 20, at which time it was only 119 million miles away. When it departs from Earth, the farthest distance will be nearly 100 million miles. The number 100 million is 1,000,000,000,000. The vastness of celestial bodies is truly unimaginable.

㊁ Plants From 500 Million Years Ago

The Harvard Botanical Museum in the United States recently announced the discovery of the world's oldest terrestrial plant, a fossil shoot from the "Cambrian Period" 500 million years ago. According to Dr. Darrah, head of the museum's research department, this plant is likely a bare green stem without petals or flowers, discovered in a black oil shale specimen excavated in Sweden. The age of the higher plant species on Earth known today has been doubled by this discovery. Previous evidence indicated that plants initially originated in water, during the peak of the "Silurian Period" about 300 million years ago. Now we know that there were plants on land 500 million years ago. The discovery of "Cambrian Period" plants was made possible by a new method invented by Dr. Darrah. He said that it is now possible to peel off transparent cross-sections of one twenty-five thousandth of an inch thick from a fossil for microscopic study. The smallest plants that can be seen by the naked eye are wrapped in a waxy layer, which prevents them from absorbing water and makes them almost immune to decay. They all possess the most minimal elements required for terrestrial life. From the discovery of this oldest plant, we can imagine the antiquity of the Earth's age.

### A Confucianist Joint Sentence by China and Japan

In 1896, Xu Tianmian established the Datong School in Japan, under the direction of Kang Youwei, with the mission of revitalizing Confucianism. He consulted with Dr. Nemoto Tsumemine, a leading Japanese Sinologist, on methods for China and Japan to jointly promote Confucianism. The following year, on Confucius' birthday, a grand celebration was held at the Chinese Association. A couplet was hung in the hall, which read:

"Sharing the same race and the same script, and able to connect through the same teachings, we will not allow the West to show its tiger's eyes;

Great Qing and Great Japan, from now on will achieve great things together, gazing afar at the East Asia celebrating the journey of the qilin."

Now, Japanese soldiers are single-mindedly focused on plotting against us. If they could act as the above couplet says, and support each other under the principle of equality, then the yellow race would become increasingly prosperous. Otherwise, both sides will suffer, and the fisherman will reap the benefits!

### A Glimpse of the New-New Company's World of Childcare Products

— By Langgan

The New-New Company recently held a "World of Childcare Products" event, focusing on the four aspects of children's "nurturing, education, physical development, and hygiene." I made a special trip to visit it once, and I will describe what I saw below:

㊀ Belonging to "Nurturing," it encompasses two parts: clothing and diet. In the clothing section, children's clothing, hats, shoes, socks, etc., for spring, summer, autumn, and winter are arranged in order, and all are of excellent quality and novel styles, especially at low prices, which are very suitable for the purchasing power of the common people. At the same time, there is a child clothing guidance department and a clothing making guidance department, specializing in answering questions from all walks of life about children's clothing and guiding clothing making methods. As for the diet section, all foods rich in nutrients are available, and Mrs. Whillin from England is responsible for guiding infant feeding methods. Whenever she encounters a child, she personally gives a cup of milk powder to show her hospitality, and parents who bring their children can observe and learn her infant feeding methods at this time.

㊁ Belonging to "Education," there are books on the words and deeds of famous people from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, as well as interesting stories and various wall charts, which are sufficient to enlighten children's wisdom and serve as good rules for children to practice. Those that are suitable for children's level and psychology are selected and listed for visiting children to browse and for parents to use as a reference for choosing educational materials for children. And every Monday morning, the spade club drama troupe is invited to perform "Good Mother," instilling knowledge of family education in the women's community.

㊂ Belonging to "Physical Development," in addition to a wide array of sports equipment, there is also a small sports field, with slides, swings, parallel bars, billiards, etc., for children to play and exercise. In addition, there are many hanging pictures, showing the postures of various sports, and explanations of sports techniques are added for children who come to play to imitate.

㊃ The "Hygiene" section has the widest scope, including both "medical" and "obstetric" aspects. For example, there are free vaccination rooms and dental examination rooms, all staffed by many experts who perform surgery and provide various common sense instructions at any time and anywhere, prompting people to pay attention to vaccination and other issues. Regarding the anatomy of physiology, the process of children's growth, the characteristics of pregnant women's pregnancy months, the methods of raising children, the methods of bathing newborns, the signs of children's illnesses, etc., they are explained by hanging pictures, clarified by models, stated in writing, or demonstrated by instructors one by one, all in great detail. The equipment for the above items is also widely displayed, forming a grand spectacle.

㊄ The toy department is also attached, but the scope is very wide. The various toys on display are not just for children to play with, but all contain educational meaning. For example, building blocks and jumping frogs can inspire children's scientific thinking, counting toys can instill arithmetic knowledge in children, and small model airplanes, submarines, tanks, machine guns, and other toys can make children accustomed to playing with them, reducing their fear of killing weapons and enhancing their martial spirit.

㊅ The children's paradise, although affiliated in nature, is very expensive and has the greatest attraction. In addition to showing movies every afternoon, the New-New Garden's various entertainment troupes are invited to take turns performing dramas, magic, comedy, acrobatics, opera, and Suzhou operas in the morning, free for people to watch, thereby attracting people from all walks of life and children to visit.

Looking at the entire exhibition, it is full of educational significance, especially the children's paradise, which is beautifully arranged and very suitable for children's psychology. The kindergartens in schools can be well used.

### Night Voyage

— By Fulou

The sky is completely dark. A waning moon hangs lonely in the sky, which is so blue that there is not a single cloud. The stars twinkle like diamonds. The sea is extremely calm, except for the soft murmurs of the waves lapping against the hull: there is no other sound. No one on the ship wants to speak. The dim mast lamp sways in the air like a ghost, just like a faint life floating in the sea.

Since my father was swallowed by the sea, my mother has never been willing to let me go far away, to travel by water. Our family's inherited fishing business came to an end. But this time, I am doing my father's business again. For the sake of feeding a few mouths, and because of my own incompetence, I finally obeyed the manager's order and went to sea to do this life-threatening job of supervising fishing.

Besides the foreman and me, there are fourteen young sailors on board. They are born with the habit of not talking at sea, so the atmosphere is even more沉闷, as沉闷 as the Black Sea, as the desert, as the graves on the barren mountains.

Thinking of my father's death, my heart trembled incessantly. ... Ten years ago - that tragic scene from ten years ago played out in my mind like a movie. It aroused my sadness, aroused my fear of not being able to grasp life.

It was a windy day after the Beginning of Summer. I was in school when suddenly Baldy Er from the east of our village rushed into our classroom, covered in sweat and gasping for breath, and said: "Erguan, ... Erguan, hurry back! Your mother is crying and has fainted! ... Your father has been swept away by the wind, and also a dozen people from the village. ... The boats are all gone, only the bodies have been brought back. ..." I was as if struck by lightning, and I cried in fright. I didn't have time to report to the teacher, and I didn't even take my schoolbag. I limped and stumbled, crying and walking with Baldy Er. When I got home, my mother had already cried and fainted, and her tears had dried up. The aunts from the neighborhood were crying with her, and sorrow enveloped the entire village. Looking at my father, it was a face I had never recognized before. His eyes and nose were blurred, and his chest was as big as an ox's belly. ... He ran out of the house with a smile, and now he brought us tears and sorrow to enjoy.

Calculating, it has been a full ten years! In these ten years, this sad image has followed my mother and me closely. In my dreams, my mother often woke me up, repeatedly urging her son not to do the job of fishing,宁可 beg for food, 宁可 starve. ...

And in these ten years, what my mother and I have suffered is颠沛 and流离. The only time the living people in our family are alive is on the day of my father's anniversary, when we cry heartily and complain to the dead. I have sold rice wine, and even worked as a butcher, the most heartless profession. But what can give us food and clothing? Except for Shenjiamen - my hometown - the special profession of fishing.

The boat passed the mountain peaks, and several gusts of wind blew from the mountain, and the sea surface began to stir slightly. The foreman held the rudder, and the boatmen held the net wefts and boom ropes, waiting for the fish shoal. It is said that the fish shoal will pass by at this time.

After about two hours of sailing, the Big Dipper clearly illuminated the vast sea, and the wind was not getting calmer. The sea waves slightly lifted its lips, as if telling us the whereabouts of the fish shoal. The nets had been lowered on the boat, and the boatmen were preparing to carry out their obligations to the boss. Everyone was silent, the sparks of cigarettes swayed in the sea breeze, and they listened intently to the news of the fish shoal.

"Gurgle! Gurgle! Gurgle!" The sound of the fish shoal drifted clearly across the sea surface, and everyone on the boat was as excited as if they had discovered a new continent. Our boat sailed towards the sound of the fish shoal, and the work on the boat suddenly became tense. Casting the net, retrieving the net, adding salt, ... busy.

When the sky was white in the east, the fish shoal dispersed. Our cabin was fully loaded with five compartments, and joy hung on everyone's faces.

When I got home, my mother and wife celebrated me as if I had awakened from a serious illness, but I myself was deeply worried. - What if I don't come back next time?

### Song of Homesickness

— Written and Painted by Huang Shiying

— Dedicated to the Compatriots of the Northeast

My hometown that I have been away from for five years,

My hometown is better than my loving mother,

The locusts occupy the rivers and mountains of the Northeast,

Shame fills the homes of the country!

Oh, hometown!

The rivers and mountains are still the same, but the scenery is completely different!

Unbearable to look back, full of misery!

I miss that lovely hometown,

That fertile land,

That abundant produce,

That boundless mine,

That dense forest,

Xing's great Great Wall,

That is our lovely hometown!

Who made its country change color? Lost overnight!

Now, ah, they have all been fed to the wolves and tigers!

I look at that distant hometown,

I only see enemy riders running rampant.

I look at that lovely hometown,

I only see lambs being devoured,

I listen to the sound from my hometown,

I only hear wailing and crying!

I shed tears of shame under the moon!

Tears cannot wash away the stains of shame in my hometown.

Listen:

Boom! Boom! Boom!

That is the roar of the masses resisting the enemy!

Only with our flesh and blood can we drive the enemy out of the border! Long! Long! Long!

That is the sound of the cannons of the independence and liberation of a weak nation.

Cannonballs pierce the chest of the invaders, I am willing to serve on the battlefield and win glory for the country!

Return my hometown to me, and my hometown shoots out the light of the motherland.
