### The Judicial Yuan Clarifies Doubts

[Nanjing] The Guangdong High Court requested an interpretation of whether a falsely accused person can request a review. The Judicial Yuan's interpretation is as follows: The crime of false accusation requires the intent to subject another person to criminal or disciplinary punishment as an essential element. In addition to infringing on the interests of the state, it also has the intent to infringe on personal interests. The falsely accused person can file a private prosecution. If he accuses the prosecutor and the prosecutor makes a decision not to prosecute, he can also request a review directive to comply with. (Special dispatch, 27th)

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Qianjiang Bridge Overturning Tragedy

— Du

Since the Qianjiang Bridge began construction, the project has been progressing quite actively. As the deadline approached, efforts were stepped up, digging mud and building piers were carried out late at night. The cold night, strong winds, and heavy dew made the work already extremely difficult. Unexpectedly, the overturning accident occurred due to carelessness during the night crossing. Of the hundred or so workers on the boat, only thirty were rescued, and the rest were swept away by the current. As of the most recent salvage, the confirmed number of drownings has reached seventy-eight. Some of the deceased workers' fate is still unknown. In total, more than 700 bridge workers died, accounting for one-tenth of the total. This cannot be said to be a shocking tragedy. After this incident occurred, those directly responsible should feel deeply pained. Even those in other places who usually care deeply cannot help but express their deep sympathy. Building the Qianjiang Bridge is not an easy task. The greatness of the project is widely recognized. Now, this unexpected misfortune has dampened the enthusiasm of the workers and affected the progress of the project. It is difficult for the general public to accept this. Before the aftermath is properly handled, I would like to offer a humble opinion.

All difficult and dangerous projects have their obstacles. The key is for those in charge to control them properly to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Regarding the Qianjiang Bridge project, there have been past incidents of damage, either due to the sudden outbreak of illness or due to the impact of disasters. Since these cannot be prevented by human effort, one can only accept fate. However, this matter is different from the past. The workers were crammed onto the boat, causing the helmsman to panic. The ferry boat was overloaded, causing it to capsize in the middle of the river. After the accident, there were no emergency measures or proper rescue efforts. Only a few of the hundred or so strong men were spared from becoming food for the fish. It is clear that the training was poor, the control was lax, the equipment was lacking, and the response was disorganized. The past responsibility is easy to discuss. Regarding future punitive measures, there should be a thorough rectification. Not only should there be proper equipment for late-night crossings, but other unexpected events must also be planned for. If human efforts are exhausted, then there will be no resentment in death. This is something that those in charge should repeatedly consider. The deceased workers should be given generous compensation to comfort the spirits of the dead and encourage the living. It is said that the contractor has agreed to pay 150 yuan per person and transport the coffins back to their hometowns. The Hangzhou General Labor Union also plans to request the provincial government and the Ministry of Railways to provide relief to the families of the deceased. This is a fair request, not an excessive demand. In order to urge the bridge project to move forward, the authorities should make a commitment as soon as possible.

Finally, I have one more thing to say. Completing the bridge project on schedule is the most important thing today. The occurrence of this tragedy should not be used as an excuse for delay. Instead, efforts should be doubled to expedite the completion of the project. Based on the lessons learned from this incident, it is clear that the ferry is dangerous. The section of the Qianjiang River near the Liuhe Pagoda is originally narrower and shallower. However, due to overloading, this disaster still occurred. The Yi Ferry has a vast river surface and is filled with countless passengers. There must be situations where people are competing to be first. Just imagine how much more terrifying it would be. To eliminate future crises, the only way is to complete the bridge as soon as possible to allow direct passage. Moreover, the deceased worked hard day and night and looked forward to its completion. Now, this magnificent bridge is beginning to show its towering form, but those who participated in the construction have not been able to celebrate their success and have instead met with a fatal accident. The regret of failing after nine piles of earth is always on their mind in the underworld. If those who survive can take this as their responsibility and do their best, then the contribution to the project will greatly increase. The workers in the underworld can also rest in peace.

### French Chamber of Deputies Discusses Strengthening National Defense

Demanding Unified Military Orders and Mechanization of the Army. The President Orders the Nationalization of Ammunition Manufacturing

[Paris] The French cabinet held a meeting today, at which President Lebrun personally signed seven orders stipulating that several aircraft manufacturing factories be converted into state-owned companies. This is in accordance with the French government's policy of nationalizing a portion of the ammunition manufacturing industry. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies discussed national defense issues this afternoon. Member of Parliament Reynaud gave a speech, stating that the army is not as strong as other countries in terms of numbers, and the government should make efforts to improve armaments to compensate for this. In addition, armaments factories should be established throughout the country to avoid the disadvantages of concentration in one place. He also said that when Germany marched into the Rhineland on March 7th last year, the French government sought the opinion of the military authorities. The answer was that if the French army wanted to take action, the mobilization time required in advance was extremely long, and the cost was extremely high. Based on this, France must have a strong mechanized force so that it can mobilize quickly when necessary. The general staff of the navy, army and air force should also be merged into one, and a grand marshal should be established to command the three services so that military orders can be unified in times of crisis. Regarding the air force, he said that the United Kingdom and France each have 1,300 new-style aircraft, while Germany has 2,000. Therefore, it is also necessary to build more aircraft and organize air defense. In addition, regarding the army, the armored division compiled by the Minister of National Defense Daladier during his tenure as Minister of the Army in 1932 has not been improved recently. Although France has new tanks, their number is far less than Germany. Therefore, the mechanization of the army is extremely urgent. Finally, he said that the government's procedure for reorganizing armaments can ask the working class to cooperate in order to see the results as soon as possible. Yaqinuo, a member of the Republican Democratic Union of the right wing, declared that France's border defenses are quite strong, and even if other countries launch a sudden attack, it will be difficult to succeed. However, the organization of the border defense forces should be flexible so that they can participate in offensive warfare instead of focusing on defensive work. The leader of the Republican Democratic Union, namely former cabinet member Maran, then spoke, advocating the speedy organization of passive defense work, and that all young people in the country should receive military training.

### Resolution of Two International Disputes

Language Issues in Alexandria and Antioch. Turkey and France Establish a Compromise

The League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting Ends Today. The Next Ordinary Meeting is Scheduled for May 24th

[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council is extremely pleased to have resolved two thorny disputes. The dispute between France and Turkey was resolved by agreeing to form a committee to draft a concrete code for the Sanjak. Various issues concerning Danzig have also reached a compromise. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

[Geneva] The current session of the League of Nations Administrative Council will probably come to an end tomorrow. An informal meeting was held today, and it was decided that the next ordinary meeting of the Administrative Council, namely the 97th session, should originally be held on the first Monday of May (May 10th). However, because King George VI of the United Kingdom is scheduled to hold a coronation ceremony on the 12th of that month, it was postponed by two weeks to the 24th of that month. As for the meeting of the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference, it is scheduled to be held on May 6th. In addition, there are three items on the agenda for tomorrow's meeting of the Administrative Council.

㊀ Following the appointment of Lester, the High Commissioner of the League of Nations stationed in the Free City of Danzig, as the Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations, the successor has been internally determined to be Lieutenant General de Graff, the former Chief of Naval Staff of the Netherlands. It is expected to be formally appointed at tomorrow's meeting of the Administrative Council.

㊁ Regarding the issue of the Turkish minority in the cities of Alexandria and Antioch within Syria, a compromise has now been reached on the language issue that the two sides finally disputed. (According to the Turkish representative, the cities of Alexandria and Antioch should only use Turkish as the official language, which France considered inconvenient to follow.) Therefore, the two sides have reached a complete agreement, and the agreement will be filed at tomorrow's meeting of the Administrative Council.

㊂ Regarding the evacuation of refugees accommodated in the embassies of various countries in Madrid, Spain, a method will be decided at tomorrow's meeting of the Administrative Council.

In addition, regarding the issue of re-distribution of raw materials, the Administrative Council has appointed representatives from 14 countries to organize a special committee to study it. Because the International Labor Bureau previously raised this issue for discussion at a meeting in 1919, French Foreign Minister Tarbos advocated that the Bureau also send a representative to participate in this committee in order to achieve better results. The Administrative Council approved it. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### Anniversary of the Nazi Party's Rule in Germany

Hitler to Issue Declaration

[Berlin] Germany will hold a celebration this Saturday to mark the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule.

It is heard that the election of the new speaker of the Reichstag is also on the agenda. After the completion of the above matters, Hitler will deliver a speech on domestic and foreign affairs. Hitler's speech is quite long, and it will take about two hours. He will respond to British Foreign Secretary Eden's recent call for Germany to cooperate in seeking peace. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Continued Trial of the Soviet Russian Counter-Revolutionary Case Reveals Conspiracies of Germany and Japan

German Engineer Testifies to Inside Story - Japan Subsidized Huge Sums - Hollywood Actors Also Involved

[Moscow] The trial of seventeen former high-ranking Soviet officials accused of counter-revolutionary activities continued today. A German engineer named Stamm, employed at the Gusbass coal mine, testified in court with shocking revelations. He claimed that many German engineers working in the Soviet Union had tried to recruit him into a conspiracy of sabotage and espionage, telling him, "You are here working for Germany, not helping the Bolsheviks," to stir his patriotic feelings. When he refused, they called him a coward and a traitor. Eventually, an official representative of Germany in Novosibirsk came to persuade him to engage in anti-Soviet activities, promising assistance if he were exposed. Stamm's testimony also mentioned the German engineer Stickling, who was convicted last November for allegedly plotting sabotage in Siberian mining areas. Therefore, it is generally believed that the prosecutor intends to implicate the 35 German nationals arrested since last November in this case. At the opening of today's trial, Judge Ulrich clashed with the prosecutor because he did not allow the defendant Stroilov to testify about his relationship with the German military attaché in Novosibirsk. After a formal protest by Prosecutor Vyshinsky, the judge allowed Stroilov to continue his testimony, but warned him not to reveal the names and nationalities of foreign representatives. It is said that the German consular officer instructed Stroilov to engage in sabotage in the coal industry to prevent Soviet coal production from competing with Germany. Furthermore, defendants Livshitz, former head of the Soviet Railway Bureau, and Kenazhev testified that they had received 35,000 rubles and other items from Japanese secret agents as rewards for sabotaging railways and assassinating Stalin, Ukrainian important official Postyshev, and his Communist Party Central Committee member Sivers. Their testimony was followed by a detailed account of his life's misadventures by the defendant Aniol, which lasted for three hours, somewhat easing the tense atmosphere in the courtroom. According to Aniol himself, he had become a U.S. citizen, worked as a film actor in Hollywood, and finally joined various dangerous undertakings. He had narrowly escaped death several times while abroad before returning to Russia and joining the Trotskyist party. Aniol further confessed that in 1933, when the Chairman of the Soviet Council of People's Commissars, Molotov, inspected the Ural mines, he served as his driver and admitted that he had intended to drive the car off a cliff to kill Molotov, but at the last minute, he suddenly felt a nervous breakdown and did not carry out the plan. (Reuter, 26th)

[Moscow] Another shocking incident occurred today. The former director of the South Ural Railway Bureau, Kryazhev, confessed that there were over 1,500 train wreck conspiracies in 1934 and approximately 2,000 in 1935. According to his confession, he should be held fully responsible for the train accident that killed 65 people and injured 164. Kryazhev continued that he had been forced to hand over the army mobilization plan to a Japanese secret agent, who insisted that troop transport trains should be filled with the most virulent bacteria in the event of war and that trains carrying food supplies should be set on fire. (Reuter, 27th)

### Person Who Ordered the Tsar's Execution During the Russian Revolution

Arrested in Moscow

### Japanese Military Refuses to Cooperate, Ugaki Cabinet Fails to Form

Consultations with Senior Officials in the Imperial Court Yesterday Morning - Decision to Make Further Efforts to Overcome Difficulties

[Tokyo] Although there has been no significant progress in Ugaki's cabinet formation, he is still making a final effort. As of late last night, Ugaki had not indicated that he would abandon the task of forming a cabinet, suggesting that he still has other plans. However, general observation believes that it is very difficult to easily overcome the current difficulties. (Central News Agency, 27th)

[Tokyo] Ugaki's cabinet formation has entered its most difficult stage. This morning, Ugaki entered the Imperial Palace to meet with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa Kurahei to request that he report to the Emperor the greatest difficulties encountered in forming a new cabinet. The current situation has reached a point where Ugaki has no hope of obtaining a Minister of the Army unless extraordinary measures are taken. However, not only can such measures not be implemented at this time, but even if they were, they would only make the political turmoil more serious and make it more difficult to deal with the future situation. Furthermore, the cabinet formed by such a posture would also be unsustainable. Therefore, general observation last night and this morning believes that Ugaki has no other way to go but to abandon the task of forming a cabinet. This morning, Japanese newspapers unanimously expressed regret over the impending failure of Ugaki's cabinet formation. This situation makes our perspective on the current trend and future of Japanese politics even more profound. (Central News Agency, 27th)

[Tokyo] General Ugaki, on the third day of cabinet formation, met with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa on the morning of the 27th and is still making a final effort to form a cabinet. However, the current objective situation is still on the verge of failure, and the situation is extremely worrying. General observation from various aspects is roughly like this: It seems impossible for General Ugaki to ease the strong attitude of the army in the current situation using ordinary methods and means. Even if he exerts all his strength, it is doubtful whether he can open up the situation. The meeting with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa may reveal any solution. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

[Tokyo] The difficult process of General Ugaki's cabinet formation and the details of his meeting with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa are as follows, according to General Ugaki's close associates. Today, General Ugaki met with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa to report on the progress of cabinet formation. The cabinet formation headquarters has not given up its hope. The so-called resigning the imperial mandate or other so-called extraordinary measures are not being considered. There are considerable strong recommendations for the successor to the Minister of the Army, so it should not be completely impossible for someone to take office. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

[Tokyo] Senior officials in the Imperial Court stayed up late in the Imperial Palace last night, watching the progress of General Ugaki's cabinet formation, and talked with Prince Saionji for a long time by long-distance telephone. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

[Tokyo] The army authorities refused to recommend candidates for Minister of the Army to General Ugaki. However, General Ugaki issued a statement that he would continue to form a cabinet according to the established policy. The world believes that Ugaki must have a secret plan to achieve his cabinet formation goal. The so-called secret plan is: ❶ Although former Minister of the Army Terauchi stated that there were no candidates for Minister of the Army other than the few recommended on the 26th, General Ugaki is familiar with the internal affairs of the army, or after conducting personal negotiations with the people he deems appropriate, he will request former Minister of the Army Terauchi to convene a meeting of the three chiefs to decide to recommend that person as a candidate for Minister of the Army. ❷ Request the Emperor to issue an imperial edict to the three chiefs of the army to select candidates for Minister of the Army. However, General Ugaki, in view of the seriousness of the situation, is unwilling to take the second method. Therefore, Ugaki seems to be adopting the first method and exerting his final efforts. However, the army's opposition attitude is unlikely to be eased, and Ugaki's cabinet will inevitably fail. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

### Imai's Statement

Still Upholding the Spirit of Careful Agreement - Proceeding with Organizational Work

[Tokyo] Regarding General Ugaki's cabinet formation, Chief of Staff Imai Tadashigeru issued the following statement at the cabinet formation headquarters at 4:20 pm today: General Ugaki entered the Imperial Palace today and said that he was asking for a few days of delay. The so-called few days can be interpreted as two or three days, or five or six days, but it should not be taken as conclusive. He will definitely try to find a quick solution as much as possible, and he must not prolong the situation into a protracted war. The 28th should be the final period. This statement also cannot be clearly stated by me. As for the so-called quietly awaiting any imperial edict from the Imperial Court, this has not been considered. The delay in cabinet formation has caused misunderstandings and anxiety, which is extremely worrying. If our actions increase the country's concerns, we should absolutely avoid them. General Ugaki will probably take any action, but the results of his handling must be carefully considered. What General Ugaki is considering has nothing to do with the impact of today's meeting with the Minister of the Imperial Household. In short, how the situation is, I do not want to use the words "improve" or "reverse." Roughly speaking, our actions are based on what we think, which depends on what the internal situation is. It is not convenient to say how it is currently proceeding. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

[Tokyo] Imai Tadashigeru further said to others at 10:00 pm: Tonight, I originally intended to promote the cabinet formation, but I still have not come up with a plan and will wait until tomorrow. This place will thoroughly consider everything in accordance with the purpose of a satisfactory solution and will never use any legal means for the sake of obtaining a Minister of the Army. It is not possible to predict whether there will be a meeting with the army cadres on the 28th. However, this place will try to find a solution in a spirit of coordination. Any resolution or intention that violates this spirit has not been considered. The navy has not yet replied because the time to urge them has not yet arrived. In addition, there is no pre-determined priority for the army over the navy. In short, we will do our best to coordinate and solve the problem in a satisfactory manner and will never use any exceptional methods. The Minister of the Army issue must also be agreed upon by the three chiefs and should be achieved through a coordinated attitude. Before the goal is achieved, it is not yet anticipated whether to continue this state at any time or to ask for further delay. It is not known until tomorrow whether General Ugaki will meet with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa or pay a visit on the 28th, because there is currently no so-called planned action. As for conducting cabinet entry negotiations by telegram, there is no such thing. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

### Army Statement

Implementing Political Reform - No Attempt at Dictatorship

[Tokyo] Ugaki's cabinet encountered a fate of failure because the army's Three Chiefs Conference on the 26th announced that it would refuse to recommend candidates for Minister of the Army. The army believes that General Ugaki has no choice but to abandon the task of forming a cabinet and has no other way but to resign the imperial mandate. They also interpret the statement issued by Ugaki on the evening of the 26th as expressing his intention to resign the imperial mandate. The reason why the army refused the cabinet was not due to issues such as political platforms and policies, but because it considered General Ugaki an inappropriate person from the perspective of achieving the goal of military purification. The actual reason lies in Ugaki's personal affairs, so the army's refusal reason is absolute and there is no room for compromise. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

[Tokyo] Since the imperial mandate to form a cabinet was given to General Ugaki, various rumors have spread, claiming that the army's attitude is to prevent those who attempt to seize power and seek dictatorship, and others claiming that they will seek radical changes in the financial world. The army denies this under the following views and asserts that these rumors are deliberately slandering the army:

❶ Preventing Usurpation of Power: Considering the current relationship between the army and General Ugaki, the army is preventing the initiation of usurpation of power. However, when Commander of the Military Police Nakajima first met General Ugaki in a private capacity on his way to Kyoto and when General Ugaki visited General Terauchi, they did not advise him to resign. Also, the army did not obstruct his cabinet formation with the army's general intention or collective pressure. They only explained the internal situation in detail and stated that no one was willing to succeed as Minister of the Army. Finally, when General Terauchi visited General Ugaki, he reported that the Three Chiefs had formally agreed to select candidates for Minister of the Army and the results of coordinating with various candidates. Therefore, accusations of obstructing the usurpation of power and interfering with cabinet formation are absolutely inappropriate.

❷ Dictatorial Politics: The army's unwavering fundamental policy regarding political methods was stated in the statement on the 23rd, which is to always adhere to the unique constitution of the empire and carry out legitimate constitutional politics. Under the current circumstances, the only way to base is on this is to expect the development of a clear, proactive, and strong reformist politics. There is absolutely no attempt at dictatorship.

❸ Transformation of the Financial World: The claim that the military has the intention to carry out radical reforms of the economy, which will inevitably cause chaos in the financial world, is propaganda. The army's attitude towards economic problems is based on avoiding chaos and seeking to cope with the situation legally and gradually, in view of the current pressing situation. This is no different from the past. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

### Navy Authorities Temporarily Do Not Express Attitude

[Tokyo] General Ugaki met with Navy Minister Nagano on the afternoon of the 25th to request the navy authorities' understanding regarding the cabinet formation issue. The Navy Minister did not reply immediately. Navy Minister Nagano must consult with Prince Fushimi, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, who is currently taking refuge from the cold in Atami, and there are other various reasons. His reply to General Ugaki seems unavoidable to be delayed. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

### Japanese Youth Party Gives Advice to Terauchi

[Tokyo] The Greater Japan Youth Party organized by Colonel Hashimoto Kingoro submitted the following petition to Minister of the Army Terauchi today:

If you try to perfunctorily deal with the current political situation and misjudge the future of the empire, it will definitely not be allowed. If you release an arrow and miss the target of reform, you will have to pay for it even in death. We express our full support for the historical mission of the army authorities to thoroughly promote reforms in the central leadership with an unwavering determination and fervent devotion. We still hope to implement our original intentions in order to move forward. This is what we earnestly hope for. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

### Financial World Hopes

For the Emergence of a Powerful Cabinet - Early Stabilization of the Political Situation

[Tokyo] Because the army refused to recommend a successor to the Minister of the Army, Ugaki's cabinet is in danger of failing under the current objective circumstances. However, as the political situation becomes more urgent, what the financial world is most concerned about is the attitude of the army, which is a realistic force capable of influencing the political situation. Its political goals and the substance of its reformist trends are enough to determine the base tone of the financial world from now on, causing all nerves to concentrate sharply. It is believed that the new cabinet's policies will be more radical than ever before, so the so-called wartime system will be further promoted in both the political and economic fields, which the financial world is proud of. Therefore, we hope that a powerful cabinet that is expected by the public will quickly deal with the political situation, stabilize the situation, and clarify the direction of its political and economic movements.

### Uninvited Guests Break into Ugaki's Private Residence

Demanding Retreat in the Face of Difficulty - Hat Was Damaged

[Nanjing] General Ugaki entered the Imperial Palace this morning to meet with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa to discuss solutions to open up the difficulties in forming a cabinet. After returning to his private residence, three uninvited guests followed him into the room, intending to harm Ugaki. However, they were stopped by Ugaki's guards, unable to succeed. Ugaki was fortunately unharmed, but his silk hat was damaged. The three men have now been arrested and are members of the Farmers' and Workers' Alliance. They were not carrying weapons, only holding a petition demanding that Ugaki retreat in the face of difficulty and had no intention of causing harm. (National News Agency, 27th)

### Important Speech by Chairman Yuki of the Japan National Chamber of Commerce

Preventing the Impact of a Large Budget - Promoting Sino-Japanese Friendship - Supporting American Economic Policy

[Tokyo] The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry held a meeting of representatives of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry at the Industry Club on the 26th. Chairman Yūki Toyotarō gave a speech on the current situation, the content of which is quite noteworthy. Yūki briefly stated that the government has prepared a huge budget for this year and is trying to implement tax system reforms to deal with the serious international situation. This is indeed an unavoidable situation, but its impact on the financial and industrial worlds is extremely large. When the government implements this budget, we must make all-round plans to prevent its impact. The significant issues arising from budget increases, tax increase plans, etc., are rising prices. Rising prices are a global phenomenon. However, it is quite clear that unnatural price increases in Japan will not only have a negative impact on the financial, industrial, and trade worlds, but also pose a significant obstacle to the implementation of the budget. As for Sino-Japanese relations, China and Japan should always maintain friendly relations. However, I regret that recently, they have turned against each other at every turn. I said at the New Year's banquet to experts and the public in neighboring China, advocating the necessity of economic friendship between the two countries. Looking at the recent international trade situation, nationalistic economic concepts dominate the general situation, creating an unpleasant atmosphere between countries. I believe that opening up this dead end in the international economy and clarifying trade relations can ease the tension and will definitely contribute to world peace. Therefore, the urgent task now is to try to restore the international economy. In this sense, I express my greatest respect for the remarks of U.S. Secretary of State Hull. When we advocate economic friendship, we should conduct negotiations in a spirit of mutual concession to resolve trade issues, Chinese issues, etc. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

[Tokyo] Yūki, the chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who strongly advocated promoting Sino-Japanese friendly relations, advocated Anglo-Japanese economic reconciliation at a reception for parliamentarians on the night of the 26th, attracting attention. Previously, various circles in the financial world had plans to send goodwill missions to various countries, or intended to send economic reply missions to the British economic envoy Sir Henry Page Croft, the American economic envoy Frank Orren Lowden, and the Chinese economic envoy Wu Dingchang. However, due to changes in the situation, they were forced to suspend and were unable to realize it. However, various circles in the financial world, as in Chairman Yūki's speech, are very enthusiastic about the hope of economic cooperation with the above-mentioned countries. Therefore, after the current political situation stabilizes, the plan to dispatch economic goodwill reply missions is bound to be brought up again. In particular, the Japan Economic Federation believes that the International Chamber of Commerce Congress in Berlin in June is an excellent opportunity to send reply missions to the UK and the US.

### Serious Flooding in the United States - Government Actively Provides Relief

Victims Numbered 750,000 - House of Representatives Passes Huge Disaster Relief Bill

[New York] It is learned that the number of deaths due to flooding has reached 345, but the death toll is likely to increase after reports are received from many isolated people. To date, the total number of displaced persons has reached 750,000, and property losses are increasing daily, currently estimated at $350 million. The plague in Louisville is the worst of all the major cities, with 200 men, women, and children dying of exhaustion, and there is also a raging fire. Local police are now demolishing tall buildings to stop the spread. Red Cross officials are now working hard to provide relief, saying this is the most urgent event the organization has faced since the European War. Fifty planes carrying multiple doctors and medicines and food have flown to Louisville. It is generally believed that the worst period of the Ohio River basin has passed, but large groups of people are still working day and night to pile up planks and sandbags to secure the 300-mile-long dikes on both banks of the Mississippi River. They are trying to build a high wall to stop the torrents that are now pouring from the Ohio River into the Mississippi. It is reported that approximately 2 million acres of farmland in the Mississippi River basin have been flooded. At the same time, the Midwest is still suffering from drought, and the hope for rain is like the hope for floodwaters to recede in the flood zone. (Reuter, 27th)

[Washington] The lack of drinking water and the rudimentary sanitary facilities in the flood areas have caused great concern about the outbreak of serious infectious diseases. The number of deaths from the flood has now reached 132, and the losses have reached $300 million. This flood is feared to be the largest in American history. Volunteers are now busy piling up sandbags to dam the water in southeastern Missouri, indicating that the Mississippi River will also overflow. The Mississippi River is the eastern boundary of Missouri, 500 miles long. After the great flood of 1927, flood control structures worth $1 billion were built in the lower reaches of the river, and it will now be tested whether they are effective. Washington, Boston, and Philadelphia are sending planes loaded with serum to various disaster areas. At the same time, the Ohio River in Cincinnati, Ohio, is currently rising rapidly, and 200,000 more people may flee to shelters. The House of Representatives today passed a $790 billion disaster relief bill to provide government funds to help the refugees. (Reuter, 26th)

### Various Circles in Guangdong Province Actively Relieve the Current Rice Shortage

Imported Rice Allowed Entry with Half Tax, Still No Benefit; First Batch of Wuhu Rice to Guangdong Begins to Sell at Reduced Prices

Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong's grain supply has recently been short, and prices remain high. In recent days, officials, businessmen, and various circles have recognized rice prices as a serious social problem in Guangdong. If rice prices do not fall, people's livelihoods cannot be solved. In this difficult time of the year, ordinary people are already suffering economic hardship. If rice is as expensive as pearls, all businesses will become more desolate, and it is feared that this will lead to public security problems. Recently, bandits in the countryside have resorted to crime due to lack of food and clothing. Gangs in waterways and bandits in the green forests are taking the opportunity to be active, robbing homes, which is often heard. Robbing ships and looting vehicles are also common. However, to relieve the current rice shortage, the highest military and civilian authorities in Guangdong Province have repeatedly appealed to the central government to exempt taxes on foreign rice to allow temporary imports to regulate the market. However, after repeated appeals, the Ministry of Finance finally approved a half tax exemption on foreign rice, with the remaining half to be borne by the provincial government through bookkeeping. Although this measure shows the central government's deep concern for the food of the people of Guangdong Province, the cost of imported foreign rice with half tax exemption, including taxes, freight, and other expenses, does not appear to be low. Merchants are unwilling to purchase it because it is not cost-effective, and it seems that it will still not help to solve the current rice shortage. Therefore, all circles in the province held a meeting on the 23rd of this month to relieve the rice shortage and decided to promote the Provincial and Municipal Party Departments, the Provincial and Municipal Chambers of Commerce, the Rice Industry Association, the Miscellaneous Grain Association, the Banking Association, the Silver Industry Association, the Machinery Industry Association, the Shipping Industry Association, the Civil Ship Association, the Provincial and Municipal Education Associations, and other 19 organizations to jointly organize the Guangdong People's Food Relief Association. They will raise funds to purchase rice and sell it at reduced prices. At the same time, they will send another telegram to the central government to exempt taxes on foreign rice, order the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei to transport rice to Guangdong for sale, abolish export rice taxes, and order the China Merchants Bureau and the Yuehan Railway Bureau to allocate additional ships and vehicles to transport domestic rice to Guangdong for assistance. At the same time, the provincial government ordered the People's Food Regulation Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Provincial Capital Police Bureau, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the current amount of grain and rice stored, calculate the daily food needs of the people, and prohibit grain merchants from manipulating rice prices. The association has previously signed an agreement with provincial and municipal banks, under which the banking group will provide a loan of 4 million yuan to purchase grain from neighboring provinces and transport it to Guangdong. Of the 4 million yuan loan, more than ten banks will recognize the amount and raise 4 million yuan, which is called the banking group's grain collateral. The agreement stipulates that the weekly interest rate is 6%, and the interest is entirely borne by the People's Food Regulation Association. After this, for each purchase of rice, the banking group will provide 80% of the funds, and the People's Food Regulation Association will bear 20%. For example, for the purchase of 1 million yuan of rice, the banking group will bear 800,000 yuan, and the People's Food Regulation Association will bear 200,000 yuan. The profits and losses of future business operations will also be borne by the People's Food Regulation Association, and the Finance Department is designated as the loan guarantee agency for the People's Food Association. It is reported that the second batch of 32,000 bags of Wuhu rice purchased by the People's Food Association has already been transported to the provincial capital. The city of Guangzhou is divided into twelve districts, and each district is assigned a rice store to sell this Wuhu rice at a fixed price. It is expected that this Wuhu rice will be completely sold out within ten days. The general public still hopes that the People's Food Association will continuously purchase and transport assistance.

### New Mine in Xiamen Confirmed as Hard Manganese

Reserves of 400,000 to 500,000 Tons, Excellent Ore Quality; Private Prospecting Only Close to Ore Vein, No Illegal Mining Yet

Xiamen Correspondence: A person named Lu Zancheng in Heshan Huguo Village (also known as Zhukeng Lake), Saizai Mountain, outside Xiamen City, formed the "Jianxingyuan Mining Cooperative," appointed himself as manager, signed a contract with Yang Binfu, a representative of the Huguo villagers, and privately started prospecting. He has dug a mining pit seven zhang deep. The Heshu Special Zone Office discovered this, detained Lu Yang and related persons for strict interrogation, and investigated whether there was any background. After this case occurred, the Special Zone Office immediately reported it to the Provincial Government. Construction Commissioner Lin sent mining technician Chen Nie to Xiamen by car on the evening of the 24th. On the 25th, he accompanied Liu Jitang from the Special Zone Office to the mining area for inspection. According to Chen's announcement, the ore quality is confirmed to be hard manganese. The ore bed spreads around about 600 meters, with reserves of about 400,000 to 500,000 tons. However, the depth of the ore bed has not been explored, so it cannot be determined. The ore quality is quite good, with a manganese content of over 80%. Manganese ore is divided into three types: soft manganese, hard manganese, and rhodochrosite. Hard manganese can be used for steelmaking. Currently, the best quality can be sold for 80 to 90 yuan per ton, and the lower quality can be sold for 40 to 50 yuan. Because the reserves of this mine are not large, a small-scale capital of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan can be used for mining. However, its advantage is that it is located in Xiamen and has convenient transportation. The private prospecting mine has also been inspected. Only stones have been dug out, just close to the ore vein. Although there is manganese quality, the content is very thin and has not yet reached the ore layer, so it cannot be said that it has been illegally mined. I have taken samples back to the province for reporting and testing." Chen also said, "The Anxi iron mine is inconvenient for transportation, and the equipment requires too much expense. The Construction Department only spent 80,000 to 90,000 yuan on exploration last year. If mining is carried out, it will require a capital of more than 10 million yuan, which cannot be handled by the current financial and economic situation of Fujian Province, so we can only wait for the future."

### Anhui Province Treasury System Completed

Land Tax from All 62 Counties in the Province Will Be Collected by Local Banks on Behalf

Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Local Bank was originally a central organization for the provincial government to promote economic construction and activate local finance. Therefore, at the beginning of its establishment, it first focused on the establishment of a foundation and the investigation of the rural economy. In the past year, it has set up branches in Anqing, Bengbu, and Tunxi, and offices in 34 counties. In terms of organization, it has completed the initial plan. In order to strictly construct the economic structure and accelerate the promotion of business, it was decided to add offices in the remaining 26 counties and organize them all before the end of May. At that time, the bank's financial network will have spread to all 62 counties in the province, and the treasury system will be fully completed. Recently, it has decided to develop several plans and actively implement them: ㊀ The construction of new houses for branches and offices in various places will be subsidized by the province, and the rest will be raised by themselves. The bank has decided to raise 100,000 yuan first and start construction in ten counties including Dangtu, He County, and Wuwei. After completion, construction will be carried out in other counties in turn. This housing project will pay special attention to the equipment of the treasury. ㊁ In the future, all provincial and county warehouses in the province must be assigned to the bank for management. ㊂ In addition to the treasury custody library and other items, the business part of the county offices must add a land tax collection office to be in charge of land tax matters. The provincial authorities plan to successfully handle the land report of the entire province in the short term, and change the land tax to be collected by the bank on its behalf, so that the county government can devote itself to the promotion of administrative aspects. This reform of the land tax method will also make the people feel great convenience.

Land Report in Southern Anhui Scheduled to be Handled in March

In order to complete the land report, the Provincial Government decided to handle 21 counties in Wuhu and Xuancheng in southern Anhui this year, and has appointed Du Shihua, a technician from the Construction Department, to be in charge of guidance. In Wuhu, the Finance Department organized a survey team to handle it directly. It is heard that the captain of the survey team has been appointed Luo Chuke, and will start at the same time in March this year. However, in Yitai, Tiancheng, Xingchun Waitan, Xintang, Baoda, Donghu Tan, Minsheng, Ouyang, and Wuzhang of Wu, Ding Jianjun, director of the Wufan Reclamation Bureau and supervisor of the upgrading of the two counties of Sufan, will jointly handle it with the county government. A survey team will be organized and dispatched to work. In order to save expenses, Ding himself will serve as the captain of the team. Regarding the compilation and investigation personnel, the Provincial Land Bureau will transfer 150 people from Fuyang and other Qingzhang personnel to Yanhu or Anqing for training. In the future, the survey will be done entirely by triangulation, and it will be completed in four months. The compilation and investigation will also be completed in four months. Together with the procedures for upgrading, the entire process will be completed in ten months.

Financial Difficulties in Reorganizing Land Tax, Profit Sharing to Subsidize Localities

After the abolition of harsh taxes and miscellaneous fees, the local financial resources of Anhui Finance Department were short. The only way out to open up new sources of income is to reorganize the land tax. The province also only hopes that the land tax can be reorganized, and the provincial and county accounting policies can be coordinated to make it abundant. Therefore, it does not hesitate to allocate the provincial treasury's regular income to supplement the county's local finances. In the 24th year, it formulated the method of reorganizing the land tax, sharing profits, and subsidizing the county's local finances, and submitted it to the provincial government for review and approval. Since its implementation, it has achieved remarkable results, especially the bad habits of following the example of disasters in the past have been completely eliminated. The actual exemption has benefited the disaster victims. The number of annual levies has increased from more than 3.7 million yuan to more than 4.8 million yuan. As of the end of June of the 25th year, the counties that reported profits from the land tax in the 24th year included He County, Huaining, Su County, Hao County, Yingshang, Lingbi, Si County, Chuzhou, and Shucheng, except for Dangtu County. Those who continue to report have not yet been counted. This is the general situation of the reorganization of land tax after the promulgation of the profit sharing method in the 24th year of this province. Since the example of disasters has been eliminated, the reorganization of land tax should focus on investigating wasteland and eliminating abuses. The counties should be urged to handle it seriously. The 25th year's method of reorganizing land tax, sharing profits, and subsidizing the county's local finances will be continued, and the paths that each county should follow for reorganizing land tax and the standard amount of tax revenue increase will be specified in the attached table. Now, a copy of the method and the attached table are specially attached, and the provincial government chairman is requested to review and approve them. They have been submitted to the Standing Committee for deliberation and resolution as planned. (January 26)

The home of Yang Zhenqing, a resident of Five Households, Six Jia, Seven Bao, Guyang Town, Kuojie, outside the West Gate of this city, was preparing lunch at about 10:00 am today (27th). Suddenly, four thugs speaking with a Hakka accent came, holding pistols, shouting to forbid any noise, and brazenly robbed the gold necklace worn around the neck of the master's mother. Just as they were about to split up to search, the master's wife heard the alarm in the back and went to the Detai Clothing Store (that is, West Gate Avenue) across the river to report the robbery. The store immediately reported it to the police station by telephone and dispatched a team. Unexpectedly, the robbers heard the telephone report across the river and did not stay any longer. They took the stolen goods and fled west and south along the railway line. The 12th Security Brigade and the Detective Team received the report successively and split up to pursue them. Captain Yang personally led the detectives to chase south. At Huangyongtan, Mizidu, Liuqi Township, they forced and captured two robbers. One robber said.

### Kunshan Opium Smoker Commits Suicide by Drowning Out of Fear of Punishment

Qian Huichun, a farmer from Seven Households, Three Jia, Two Bao, Xigu Township, Third District of the county, smoked opium. Because his family was poor and unable to obtain a license, the police went to the countryside to search for opium smokers on the 25th.

His son, A Gen, is blind and his situation is very pitiful.

### Nantong's Coastal Defense Along the Yangtze River Blocks Fleeing Bandits

The District Security Command in the Tong area along the Yangtze River and the sea has ordered the police and water patrols in each county to strictly guard against the intrusion of fleeing bandits, since the bandits in Xinyangkou have been defeated by the major teams of the Provincial Maritime Public Security Third District.

Investigate and Prohibit the Encirclement of Yicheng Beach

### Robbery Occurs in Boai Township, Jiangyin

At about 12:00 pm the night before last (25th), more than ten bandits broke into the home of Sun Xuezhai in Boai Township, Third District, and brazenly robbed them, losing about 500 to 600 yuan worth of clothing and other items in legal tender, and left with a roar.

### New Site of Changshu Library Determined

The problems of the relocation of the county government and the library, which were involved in the establishment of the county court here, have now been resolved. The county court has determined the county government's house as the court site, and the county government will move to the library. The only thing that is vacant is the new site of the library. Initially, the authorities advocated moving the library's books to the private residence of the Zhang family, but this was opposed by a majority of people. Because the library has tens of thousands of books, all of which are rare copies, once they are placed in a private residence, it is inevitable that they will be lost. Therefore, they telegraphed the provincial government and other places to stop it. Later, an order came to the county from the higher authorities, saying that it should be handled carefully. Now, the county has allocated 20,000 yuan specifically for the construction of the library. At the same time, a committee for the construction of the library was organized. After surveying the Zhishan Party in Liang Zhaoming's reading center in Shimei, it was decided to use it as the library site. It has been decided at the meeting that construction will start next month. However, before the new library is built, all the books will be properly sealed and temporarily stored in the Zhang family's house.

### Xiaoshan Implements Tea Industry Cooperation

The Pingshui Mashe Shanlou Circle green tea in Shaoshan and Xiaoshan has always occupied an important position in the international market. Now, the tea farm jointly established by the Ministry of Industry and the Construction Department is actively improving it, and the future is promising. The organization of cooperative institutions should also be urgently needed for tea farmers, relying on group strength to utilize bank funds for development. According to Tang Xunze, director of cooperation from the Construction Department, the cooperative business is already actively in progress. Recently, it was decided to extend it to the tea industry. It is planned to convene tea farm directors, tea merchants, and tea farmer representatives by the middle of next month to discuss the organization of the Pingshui Tea Industry Production and Sales Cooperative. This plan has been largely drafted. It is reported that the cooperative will be formally established when the tea season starts this year.

The Chinese football team is scheduled to gather for practice at Shen Garden at 7:00 am this morning. However, whether Li Ning, Wan Xianghua, and Chen Zhenhe will be able to attend the trial match against the Interport Ideal Team this Saturday is of great concern to the general public.

After the championships of the Shangzi, Haizi, and Shizi groups of the City Sports Stadium Open Small Ball were produced one after another, the championship week began last week.

Otherwise, it depends on the results of the next game between Bailiang and Tiejin. If Bailiang wins at that time, it will be a three-legged situation, and a round-robin battle will be needed.

### 持志 Yesterday Lost to Five Dragons

Score: 50 to 31

Yesterday, the Shanghai Park basketball season opened with three games. The first game was between Youyou and Xiaguang of Group B, Part 1. Youyou had a full roster of talent, but due to imperfect coordination in the first half, they were behind 13 to 15. In the second half, they rallied strongly, with Cheng Yize, Sun Yize, and Sun Hupei scoring repeatedly, adding more than 30 points. Xiaguang only managed to scrape together 9 points. As a result, Youyou won by a large margin of 43 to 24. The second game was between Fuzhong and the Philippines of Group B, Part 2. The situation was relatively slow-paced. In the first half, Fuzhong only narrowly won 9 to 8. The final score was 26 to 15, with Fuzhong still winning. The final game was a Group A match between Chizhi and Five Dragons. Liu Jingfeng of Five Dragons was late, so Zhao Shouchang played the first half in his place. Liang Yunming, the main player of Chizhi, did not play due to an unhealed foot injury (he had already played against Mailing with difficulty last time). Gao Baosheng filled in for the right forward position, but the coordination was poor, leading to Five Dragons controlling the entire situation. Su Yinghai, who is best at basketball, was also unable to perform well yesterday. Therefore, except for the beginning when they were evenly matched, later it all became the world of Five Dragons. Although Chizhi showed some improvement in the final moments, ultimately time was not on their side. They suffered a crushing defeat of 50 to 31. Chizhi, who was invincible among the university teams of Western Qing, has also become a second-rate team in Shanghai Park. The progress of the game is as follows:

First Half

Wu Bixian won the jump ball in the center circle. He dribbled forward and scored, giving Five Dragons the first two points. Gao Baosheng broke into the basket and tied the score. Soon after, Wang Zhenlun shot from long range, and Li Zude made a free throw, putting Five Dragons ahead 5 to 2. At this time, both sides committed numerous fouls. Su Yinghai made one of three free throws and then scored again, tying the score at 5 each. Then both sides had double free throw opportunities. Xu Zhaoxiong made both, and Chen Xuechong made one and missed one. At 6 to 7, Chizhi fell behind from then on. After that, Li and Wu of Five Dragons added 5 points, making it 12 to 6. Gao and Chen of Chizhi scored, narrowing the gap to 10 to 12, and gradually getting closer. However, luck was not on their side. Gao Baosheng and Su Yinghai had multiple good chances under the basket, but they all missed. Li and Xu of Five Dragons, on the other hand, were successful on both sides, scoring three consecutive times, and leading all the way from then on, with a fierce momentum. After Chizhi called a timeout, they replaced Gao Baosheng with Xu Peisheng. After Chen Xuechong made it 12 to 21, Xu Zhaoxiong, Li Zude, and Wu Bixian of Five Dragons were unstoppable, quickly reaching 27 to 10. Chizhi showed some improvement with Qian Jincheng, and Chen Xuechong pushed the ball in under the basket. Five Dragons also called a timeout to avoid their momentum. Chizhi then brought Gao Baosheng back on. After that, the situation was very even. Zhao and Xu of Five Dragons made two free throws, and Chen Liangxiong of Chizhi also made two shots. The first half ended with Five Dragons 29 and Chizhi 16.

Second Half

After the break, Five Dragons replaced Zhao Shouchang with Liu Jingfeng as guard. Chizhi also replaced Chen Xuechong and changed Gao Baosheng to center, but it did not work out well. After the start, Five Dragons immediately increased their score by 6 points in one go, making it 35 to 16. Chizhi chased for two minutes before Zhang Liangxiong pushed a ball in with both hands. Then they got another point, but it was not worth the loss. Li Zude and Xu Zhaoxiong of Five Dragons shot accurately, adding as many as 11 points in an instant, making it 46 to 19. The victory was already certain. After that, Su Yinghai and Wang Jincheng of Chizhi successively withdrew and were replaced by Xu Peisheng and Shu Changge, which showed some improvement. Xu Nandeng immediately made a contribution, and Li Zude of Five Dragons also scored. But Xu and Zhan of Chizhi also scored, and Five Dragons brought Zhao Shouchang back on, but it was still difficult to stop their momentum. Xu Peisheng and Zhang Liangxiong then scored three consecutive goals, chasing to 31 to 48, showing a sign of revival. However, time was not on their side. There were only three and a half minutes left. The Chizhi players, due to being too anxious, missed four good chances by Zhang, Xu, and Gao. Then Xu Zhaoxiong of Five Dragons scored again, making it 50 to 31. Then Zhou Xuexian was brought on, and both sides made no achievements, and it ended like this. Five Dragons won a big victory.

### Boy Scout Self-Help Society Launches National Boy Scout Mobilization

Collecting Waste and Performing Entertainment to Request Approval and Implementation from the General Association

Since its establishment, the Boy Scout Self-Help Society of China has seen its affairs develop day by day. According to Zheng Haozhang, the person in charge of the society, in order to expand the Aid Sui movement and encourage the people's enthusiasm for saving the country, two suggestions have been made to the Nanjing Boy Scout General Association: one is a national general mobilization for waste collection. It is requested that the General Association issue an order to Boy Scouts in various places to collect all kinds of scrap iron, broken bottles, old paper, rotten cloth, and other items, and sell them publicly to raise funds to save the country. The second is a general mobilization for Boy Scout entertainment performances. It is requested that the General Association set a date and order Boy Scouts in various places to hold entertainment gatherings or bonfire gatherings, sell tickets, and raise funds to save the country. Both of the above mobilizations will be carried out by the Boy Scouts themselves, which is different from ordinary fundraising methods and will surely achieve significant results, and its own significance is also quite profound. It is heard that the society is currently awaiting approval from the General Association in order to actively promote it, and hopes that Boy Scouts across the country will respond.

### Glimpses of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Educational Administration

Increased Subsidies and Added Elementary Schools Last Year

In 1931, the Shanghai Municipal Council decided on an educational policy aimed at increasing the number of Council schools and allocating municipal revenue to subsidize private schools, so that educational facilities in the Public Concession could be expanded and improved. Since the implementation of this policy, the number of Council schools has gradually increased. There are now five schools for Western children, five middle schools for Chinese children, six elementary schools for Chinese children, and two night schools for workers. The number of students has increased to 8,831. For non-Council schools, a subsidy system is adopted. Private schools located in the Public Concession, whose management, equipment, and teaching achievements are considered satisfactory by the Council and require financial subsidies, can be granted subsidies by the Council. There are currently 223 subsidized Chinese schools. The number of Chinese schools applying for subsidies increased last year, and the amount of subsidies that the Council could allocate was limited. After consideration, it was agreed to increase the amount by 19,000 yuan compared to the previous year. After this, the educational expenses borne by the Council will be nearly one-seventh of the total house tax collected. At the beginning of last year, the Council added an elementary school for Chinese children on Peng Road. The school is specifically designed for students from poor families who cannot afford to study. The tuition fee is only three yuan per semester, including books and stationery. Students are divided into morning and afternoon groups, each group being taught for three and a half hours. The duration of study is four years. The subjects taught are all basic knowledge, in line with the curriculum standards of the primary schools prescribed by the Ministry. The school can accommodate 1,200 students, and there are currently 1,138 students. It is expected to be full this year. Two night schools are attached to the Huishan Road Elementary School (girls) and the Jingzhou Road Elementary School (boys) to provide young male and female workers with extracurricular tutoring. The courses include reading, writing, arithmetic, hygiene, and civics. The two schools currently have more than 800 students. Regarding the future policy of running schools for Western children, a special committee was organized by the Council in October last year to consider issues such as saving expenses and allocating funds. The committee is currently studying this.

### Municipal Social Bureau Reopens Lubin Elementary School in Zhabei

The Municipal Social Bureau has decided to reopen the Lubin Municipal Elementary School in the Zhabei District, which has been closed since the Shanghai War of 1937 for five years.

The school has now started registration and is scheduled to recruit new students on January 15th and 31st. The school address is Xing Shucun, Dongheng Hong Road.

### Several Secondary Education Issues Related to English Teaching (2)

— Wang Shijie

Second, the knowledge cultivated in secondary education should emphasize both theory and experiment. This point is particularly important in today's secondary schools in China. Thousands of years ago, a great scholar pointed out the harms of learning without thinking and thinking without learning, encouraging people to use their minds on the one hand and observe things on the other. The excellent spirit of Chinese scholarship has always been to practice what one preaches. Unfortunately, for hundreds of years, because Chinese scholarship lacked scientific components, the way of scholarship has largely become empty, focusing on theory and neglecting experiment. As a result, theory lacks experimental basis. This is a long-standing problem in Chinese academia. For the past two or three decades, everyone has gradually felt this harm and has been able to cooperate to correct this problem. Considerable achievements have gradually become apparent, but the root of the problem is too deep, and it is difficult to achieve universal results without a longer period of effort. This problem is true in universities, and perhaps even more serious in middle schools. In the past two or four years, the Ministry of Education has conducted a fairly widespread test on this issue, namely, the graduation examinations for middle schools and normal schools. Perhaps everyone has already paid some attention to the results of the statistics of these past years of examinations. The usefulness of this examination is because it is not limited to a few schools or certain provinces and cities, but is a universal test for various places and schools across the country. It uses a relatively reliable method to point out a major shortcoming in secondary education across the country, namely that the grades of general schools are very bad in subjects such as physics, chemistry, and schoolwork. This is a fundamental problem in current secondary education. If secondary schools are like this, higher education will certainly not escape the influence, and the remedies that higher education can provide are also limited. At present, to promote science education, we should not just be satisfied with being able to imitate the curriculum and do a few sets of experiments. Because if there is no deeper and more thorough understanding, even if these few sets of experiments are done well, it will not be much higher than performing a few scientific tricks. What is called a deeper and more thorough understanding is the scientific attitude and the spirit of experimentation. Looking at the current situation, everyone has already recognized the importance of this issue, which is a very gratifying thing. In recent years, whether in universities or middle schools, Tianjia has paid considerable attention and made efforts in scientific equipment, teaching materials, teachers, and teaching methods. We can recognize that this is just a scaled and systematic starting point. If we compare secondary schools with universities in these areas, the number of secondary schools across the country is too large, and the level of their achievements is probably much worse than that of universities. In the future, secondary schools should make special efforts, so that we can hope that the scientific attitude and experimental spirit of students across the country can be gradually improved through considerable cultivation. This spirit and attitude, firmly established in the minds of young people, not only provides them with a good foundation for doing scholarship, but also cultivates honest, faithful, responsible, active, disciplined, and unwilling to be perfunctory character and conduct.

### School News

Quanzhou-Tong'an Middle School, located on Longhua Road in this city, is funded and established by the Quanzhou-Zhangzhou Guild Hall in Shanghai and Guangzhou. The funding is independent and the management is strict. Recently, after Lu Xingyang succeeded as the headmaster of the school, all facilities have been further advanced. However, the school site has not been completely returned due to being borrowed by the municipal police bureau for police training, which restricts the number of students admitted. The school is truly cultivating children from poor families and admits students from all over the country, not limited to children from the same province. The tuition fees are also low, so the students who apply for the examination are always very crowded. The entrance examination for the current semester is scheduled to be held on February 1st.

### Securities

Sudden Increase in Interest in Buying Government Bonds

February Futures Up Around Fifty Cents on Average

Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange government bond market, March futures began trading. Due to a clearer turn in the current situation, public morale was increasingly boosted, and the market trend grew stronger. Major players were actively absorbing supply, and new shorts were wary, leading to tight supplies of publicly available shares. The trend for far-dated contracts was especially strong. Today is the settlement date for January futures, and the market is closed for one day. Yesterday morning, the market opened with an improved environment and high public interest, with retail investors actively buying, causing a uniform price increase of fifteen and thirty cents. Far-dated contracts traded about ten to thirty cents higher than near-dated contracts. In the second session, buying interest was even stronger, with numbers 16 and 77 seeing increased buying, while numbers 43 and 10 saw significant selling. Contracts such as 戌甲 continued to rise by ten to forty cents, while 乙種 for next month fell by five cents. In the afternoon session, number 77 continued to absorb a significant amount, and 戊種 for this month rose by ten cents.

A table comparing the price changes, highs, and lows is provided below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):

### Yarn and Cotton

Yarn Market Rebounds in the Afternoon

Although Production is Rapid, a Price Drop is Difficult

The yarn market fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, but the momentum was calm. Both the long and short sides have considerable opposing strength. Indian merchants are unwilling to give up their large positions in February futures, absorbing around 50,000 bales, and hedging in March and April for about 30,000 to 40,000 bales. In this situation, they are riding a tiger and cannot easily let go. As for fellow traders, seeing the rapid increase in yarn mill production and the loosening fundamental conditions, with a surplus of spot yarn, they mostly hold a "sell on rally" strategy.

Indian Bulls Maintain Position

The opening of the raw yarn market saw flat prices across all months. In the first session, January futures suddenly fell, and the counterparty's position turned loose, mainly because a portion of the market bought forward yarn from the factories and hedged it with raw yarn. At the same time, spot sales were weak, and the unrest in the bulk three-grade yarn market affected market prices, further dampening morale. However, Indian merchants remained steadfast in their hold on February futures. As a result, prices for all months fell by 70 cents to 1.10 yuan compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon session, with the slight recovery in the three-grade yarn market, it was said that Indian bulls were not letting go, and the counterparty's position tightened, causing market prices to rebound. As a result, prices for all months rose by 50, 80, and 90 cents compared to the morning close. Sold were: Yuda 3,100 bales, Yukang 500 bales, Zhenda 750 bales, Senkang 1,050 bales, Shenji 1,600 bales, Renfeng 800 bales, Yuan Yi 450 bales, Dachangcheng 1,150 bales, Da Li 2,150 bales, and Shengyuan 700 bales. Purchased were: Hexing 1,250 bales, Jinchang 2,150 bales, Mingde 1,400 bales, Fengshou 500 bales, Yichang 1,550 bales, Runkang 1,250 bales, Tonghe 1,150 bales, and Changfeng 650 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:

Cotton Market Lingers with Fatigue

The cotton market completely lacks vitality and remains in a state of circling and hesitation throughout the day. Trading in the market is becoming increasingly quiet, with both long and short positions adopting a wait-and-see attitude. As the end of the lunar year approaches, most are preparing to close their accounts. Market prices have nothing exciting to report.

Limited Activity in Raw Cotton Market

The raw cotton market opened with a uniform decline in prices for all months, exhibiting a fatigued and weak sentiment. This is because the actual demand from cotton mills is stagnant, and the yarn market is relatively weak, further dampening morale. However, trading in the market is very light, and the market is increasingly sluggish. As a result, prices for all months fell by 5 to 10 cents compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon session saw no activity, with minimal trading. The auction lasted only 40 minutes before closing. As a result, February futures rose by 15 cents compared to the morning close, while the others remained unchanged. Sold were: Renfeng 1,900 dan, Chunchang 1,200 dan, Shengyuan 1,000 dan, Yongchang 1,000 dan, Dafu 1,100 dan, Yongda 1,100 dan, and Tonghe 1,100 dan. Purchased were: Taiyu 3,100 dan, Wangtaixing 1,000 dan, Yikang 2,800 dan, Hexing 1,600 dan, and Dachangcheng 1,000 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.

Depressed Spot Cotton Consumption

Regulations for cotton mills require quietness. The source is 1,700 bales of Yao cotton and 1,768 bales of Tong cotton.

Sale of Mortgaged American Cotton Unlikely to Have an Impact

Although There are Reports of Increased American Cotton Acreage, Prices Remain Firm

Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices up 1 to 3 points for all months. However, the decision that the terms for selling mortgaged cotton would not affect the market was announced. Traders actively bought March and May futures in large quantities, making the market very active. Outside buyers also increased. All large long positions being closed were absorbed. Inquiries for spot cotton were numerous, and prices for high-grade cotton gradually increased. The cloth market was quiet but firm. Later, due to Agriculture Secretary Wallace's statement that there were plans to increase cotton acreage and lower prices, a reaction occurred in the market. Finally, the stock market weakened, long positions were closed, and prices continued to fall. At closing, the market was stable. Spot prices rose by 9 points, while futures rose by 7 to 11 points. British spot cotton rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 8 points. The Indian cotton market is closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 26th).

Three-Grade Futures Yarn Rises, Spot Yarn Falls

Dalian telegram of the 27th: Spot yarn fell by 5 to 89. 16-count belongs to Mian 240 yuan, down 6 yuan. 20-count Goldfish 260 yuan, down 8 yuan. 40-count Five Stars 395 yuan, down 5 yuan. 42-count Pheasant 385 yuan, down 5 yuan. Three-grade futures yarn rose by 1.90 to 3 yuan. Near month is 257.60 yuan, far month is 250.60 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 10 cents to 1 yuan. Near month is 74.45 yuan, far month is 76.70 yuan.

### Piece Goods

Sharp Increase in Cloth Prices, Reduced Transactions

Strong Demand for Plain Cotton Cloth in Spring from Various Regions Remains

Yesterday, raw yarn fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, and the cloth market continued to hold firm. Demand for undyed Dong piece goods from dyehouses on this street remained good, and futures continued to rise. Major holders were aggressively manipulating the market, causing a sharp increase of about 10 cents per piece the day before yesterday, especially for grey cloth, which rose by 15 cents per piece. However, it stabilized yesterday, mainly because loading by various customers decreased significantly in the past few days. Merchants and dyehouses on this street, seeing the sharp increase in the market, reduced their purchasing interest. As a result, transactions for Dong piece goods were not strong the day before yesterday. About 100 to 150 pieces of Qingdao-bound fine cloth, fine twill, and dyed cloth were purchased by various merchants on this street. Heavy and light-weight coarse cloth from factories such as Ewo and Chentai were purchased by merchants on this street and inland Guangdong merchants for more than 400 packages. Sales of fine twill from this factory were sluggish, and production remained large, so the market sentiment was difficult to boost. Sales were flat. The spot price of spring damask is about one cent higher per yard than the original order price. Merchants from distant Sichuan and Guangdong have purchased some spot goods. Inland and local merchants still have a strong interest in hoarding, and storage is done in various places when prices are low. Transactions are particularly strong.

### Grains

Far-Dated Flour Re-Enters the Four Yuan Level

Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, showed an initial flat trend followed by increases in prices for all months. The price of foreign wheat and the Chicago wheat market opened high. However, due to weak exports and Agriculture Secretary Wallace's statement that wheat acreage would be expanded and prices would fall, speculative long positions were closed, causing prices to fall together. At closing, the results were mixed, with gains of 1.25 to losses of 0.25, and minor gains of 0.48 for Chicago Canadian. Therefore, the opening price was very calm, with very little up and down compared to the previous day's market. However, January has passed, and the closing date is approaching, so traders are mostly waiting and watching. But outside investors are quite willing to buy, and the factories are unwilling to hedge, so although trading is quiet, prices are rising by two to three cents. When the afternoon session opened, trading remained sluggish, because the long positions were slightly offering, and the actual sales to various regions remained stagnant, so there was a slight softening. According to traders' speculation, during the closing period, because all industries are preparing to close, trading will be quiet, and the market will pass peacefully.

Outside Buying Interest in Wheat Futures is Strong Again

Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a slightly better trend for all months after opening in the morning. Because January is in delivery, the total amount is said to be as high as 119 cars. With this situation, stockpiles were inevitably cleared, causing unexpected activity. Therefore, although foreign wheat was slightly lower, buying interest was relatively stronger. February and March were good by three to four cents. April and June initially showed fatigue, then rebounded. When the afternoon session opened, it was said that the goods delivered this month were returning to the factory, and those with spot goods in hand were mostly hedging, causing the market sentiment to return to flat. Because factories are not greedy for spot wheat, customers are hedging at any time according to standards, so no transactions were seen.

Summary of January Miscellaneous Grain Deliveries

Deliveries of miscellaneous grains were all strong. 28 cars of standard soybeans, 10,000 dan of soybean oil, and 70 labels of standard foreign sesame were delivered. In this situation, the domestic miscellaneous grain reserves are really abundant. It is unthinkable that speculators have excessively raised prices in recent months.

Foreign Sesame Continues to Fall by 15 Cents

Yesterday, the price of foreign sesame fell because the goods owner was closing out, but the foreign firms remained unmoved. About 1,000 tons were still traded through the Central Trust Bureau, with prices said to be 14.85 yuan and 14.75 yuan. With the turn in soybean market conditions in Dalian, morale was stabilized, but the outbound route could not be excited, so the market has not been easy to rise. Yesterday, it was estimated that five cars of Bengbu beans were taken by oil mills. More than 200 packages of Dingjia Zhou beans from this street's mainland were traded, as well as two to three hundred packages of Hankou Zhadou beans, 408 packages of 98 Winter beans, and more than 100 packages of Pinghu Doudou beans.

Slight Improvement in Hexia Rice Market

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of various currencies was less than before, only arriving on the 27th and 28th, with about 5,700 to 800 shi of goods, including thin rice on the 13th. The sales market on this street continued to be active, and groups such as Baowei also handled more than 2,000 packages of thin rice, so the price of thin rice rose by about one jiao. The price of thick japonica rice also increased by one jiao to one jiao and a half. The Du Yangjian market also showed activity.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, ships from various ports in Hexia on the 26th and 27th, the sales of various goods in the market were mobilized, and the white japonica rice in the market rebounded by one jiao and a half. Fu rice also followed closely, the price of thin rice increased by seven to eight cents, the price of Yangdu Bujian increased by nearly one jiao, the price of Kejian was slightly tight, and the price of Baiyuan increased by several cents. The rest of the goods also had an upward trend.

### Silk and Tea

Increasing Shortage of Dried Cocoons, More Silk Mills Shutting Down

Yesterday, the foreign silk market remained weak. Japanese and American silk prices continued to decline. New York recent futures fell by two and a half to three points, and spot Bin fell sharply by 20 yuan, with JinCai falling to the 885 yuan level, and futures also fell by 18 yuan. Therefore, the export silk market in this port became increasingly lifeless, and the white factories followed the market decline, with sluggish trading. Both domestic and foreign sales were extremely small, and trading records were difficult to use as a market standard. Silk mills continued to shut down due to the tight supply of raw materials. As of mid-August last year, there were 48 silk mills operating in this port, with 11,118 silk reeling machines. Later, due to the increasing shortage of dried cocoons, they were gradually forced to shut down. As of recently, only 15 factories remained, including Jiyu, Jiu Yu, Fu Li, Hengcang, and Xinchang, with only 3,200 machines. However, they will also stop production one after another due to the unsustainable supply of raw materials. Yesterday, foreign firms in this port sold a total of 40 packages, and the price of white factory goods fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Metals

Authorized Black Iron Sheets: Traders Reluctant to Sell Lightly

The price of 18-gauge authorized black iron sheets has increased from 13 yuan to 14 yuan yesterday, and trading is very strong. However, traders do not have many spot goods and are reluctant to sell lightly, so the market is unusually tight. According to a market survey, sales reached more than 2,300 bundles, purchased by thermos bottle factories and enamel factories. A small amount was also sold to out-of-town groups.

Special Article

### Observations on the Export of Dried Cocoons

— Jin Sheng

Recently, the issue of exporting dried cocoons has become a serious concern. Some say they are being shipped abroad to manufacture munitions, while others say local silk mills are being forced to shut down. There are many different opinions, and it is difficult to reach a consensus. The Silk Mill Association of this city has held emergency meetings to find ways to stop it. The Shanghai Shen Bao newspaper published a special edition on the 8th, which also included Mr. Jianping's remarks on the large-scale export of dried cocoons, with many comments on national economic planning and people's livelihood. However, this is only a superficial observation. If viewed from a strict perspective, the crux of the matter does not seem to be the pursuit of profit by a few cocoon merchants, but rather the survival of the entire national silk mill industry. The author of this article has been working in silk mills for many years and is very interested in discussing this issue. Therefore, I will briefly express my views, which should be welcomed by those who care about the silk industry, and also provide some reference for government agencies.

Although there are more than 100 silk reeling factories in this city, there are actually only 50 or 60, with 40 or 50 in operation. Some of the remaining factories have been dismantled, some have been reorganized into cloth factories, and others have been converted into other factories. This is because it is not easy for operators to succeed.

The quality of silk mill products depends on the quality of the machinery. At present, most of the silk mills operated by the Zhejiang Provincial Government have been upgraded with the latest multi-line machines. Private silk mills have also installed new-style machines with government loans. The factories operated by Xue Shouxuan, a silk industry tycoon in Wuxi, and the newly established Xingye Company have also been converted to multi-line machines and heavy reeling machines. This city is different. Except for Baotai, Ewo, Jiyu, Zhongxing, and five or six other factories that have been upgraded with semi-new-style heavy reeling machines, most are still using Italian-style silk reeling machines from decades ago. Reeling silk is against Che Lin. Five years ago, the multi-line machine of the Mimikawa style, which was considered the latest style, is now considered obsolete and has been replaced by the new-style machine produced by Zengtan Company.

The importance of silk mill machinery is as described above. Now, silk mills in this city, with old-style machinery, have difficulty meeting the uniformity requirements for silk production, and the silk body is not clean. Therefore, in the author's opinion, the export of dried cocoons is more reasonable because foreign countries have newer machinery, better technology, and need high-quality raw materials to reel high-grade silk. As for manufacturing munitions, I dare not speculate, because silk is a major export of our country, and if cocoons can be used to make munitions, why can't silk? From this point of view, silk cannot be exported either. Therefore, the author believes that the export of dried cocoons is not only not pessimistic, but also something to be congratulated on. The country with the largest silk production in the world is our eastern neighbor, and the raw materials are also the best. This time, the buyers of cocoons did not seek them from Japan, but from our country, which shows that the raw materials of dried cocoons in our country are of excellent quality and are still being adopted by foreign countries. In the future, how should our country's silk be improved and strive for excellence is the effort of those who operate silk mills.

The national dried cocoon production in the spring, summer, autumn, and late autumn seasons last year was estimated at about 300,000 dan. According to the Yun Ri Bao newspaper, the amount to be exported this time is only over 1,000 dan, which is less than 1%. It is hoped that the leaders of the Silk Mill Association will not consider the prohibition of exports as having done their best. They should immediately investigate the purpose of foreign cocoon purchases. If it is indeed being shipped for silk reeling, they should lead the national silk mill industry to catch up quickly, such as how to improve machinery and how to improve technology, so as to change the current 1% export into a continuous export. Then the future of the silk industry will be promising.

As far as the author knows, the reason why silk mills in this city are forced to stop production is not because of the depletion of raw materials, but because the purchase price does not match. At present, there are still tens of thousands of dan of dried cocoons stockpiled in the warehouses of this city and Wuxi. Unfortunately, the current market price of dried cocoons is 200 yuan per dan. Calculating the reeling of one dan of silk with 430 to 440 catties of raw materials, the cocoon cost must be 800 to 100 yuan, plus the other cost is 70 to 80 yuan, so the cost of each dan of silk must be more than 900 yuan. According to the current average silk price, each dan is only about 800 yuan, not only no profit can be made, but also the cost must be lost. That is why operators have to find another way to survive. As for the high-grade silk sold abroad, although the price is also more than 900 yuan per dan, the reeling of this silk must have the latest machinery and well-trained workers to be effective. Furthermore, since the government implemented raw silk inspection, the products of local silk mills have been difficult to pass the grade. Most regard exports as a daunting task and have to consider the next best thing, which is to sell to domestic silk weaving mills. This phenomenon cannot be denied.

Regarding the prohibition of exports, it does not seem to be a thorough solution, because the raw materials related to the national economy and people's livelihood are not only dried cocoons. For example, flour mills related to people's food have not prohibited the export of wheat, and textile mills related to people's livelihood have not prohibited the export of cotton. Now, considering the export of a small number of dried cocoons as very important is really abandoning the essentials and pursuing the trivialities, which makes foreigners laugh. Now try to prove the facts of the former double palace silk factory, which can be used as a lesson. In the spring of 1931, there were six double palace silk factories in this city. At that time, they conspired to prohibit the export of double palace cocoons so that the raw materials were sufficient to be self-sufficient. On the one hand, they asked the government to increase taxes to avoid foreign transportation, so that the tax silver paid for each dan of double palace cocoons jumped from three taels to eleven taels. In fact, it was making a cocoon to bind itself. How long did it take? Most of these six double palace silk factories could not bear the burden and closed down one after another. Only one is still struggling to survive. At the beginning of the double official silk factory's idea, it was thought to be perfect, but unexpectedly, the benefits of itself have not been received, and the harm of the industry has been tasted. At present, the annual double palace tax loss of silk merchants is no less than hundreds of thousands of yuan, which cannot be said to be a huge number. Therefore, in recent years, cocoon merchants have not hesitated to transform the best double palace cocoons into cut-mouth waste cocoons and transport them for export. This one thing can serve as a proof.

In conclusion, the export of dried cocoons should seek salvation methods from the root, and it is definitely not to close the door and conserve, which will lead to the phenomenon of creating a deep-sea drive fish and driving sparrows into the jungle. The author's reckless participation in the final discussion, try to describe the remedy as follows.

㊀ “Promote seed production” so that silk merchants and cocoon bank leaders in this city can intervene in the silkworm seed situation without being alienated.

㊁ Sericulture cooperation and production and sales cooperation to avoid cocoon merchants hoarding.

㊂ “The government should use the international market to stipulate the price of domestic cocoons and silk”, and cannot use the market price of the Japanese and American exchanges as the standard, because the price was raised by 50 or 60 yuan per dan in both spring and autumn last year.

㊃ “Improve machinery”, all old-style machinery in silk mills must be improved.

㊄ “Cultivate technicians and improve worker skills” so that the products will become more and more sophisticated.

㊅ “The government controls the sales agency and establishes overseas sales offices” so that the national silk cocoon trade can be unified.

All of these are related to the overall plan. At the beginning of this happy year, everything is new. If we can work hard to carry out, then all problems will not be difficult to solve. The author's pipe-watching is very limited, and the vastness of the sea is vast. If it is extended and broadened, then it will be fortunate.

### Cavendish

— Songshan

Henry Cavendish 1731-1810

The great British chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish was born on October 10, 1731, in Nice. In 1742, he was sent to a school in Hackney to study; in 1749, he entered Cambridge University. He left Cambridge without obtaining a degree and went to Paris to specialize in mathematics and physics.

Until the age of forty, he lived a meager existence on a small allowance from his father. In his later years, he inherited a large fortune. Having been accustomed to poverty, sudden wealth only added to his troubles and exacerbated his eccentricities. He detested socializing, refusing all engagements except for attending meetings of the Royal Society and the weekly Thursday dinners at his members' club. He seemed to strive to avoid attracting attention. Even his relatives rarely encountered him; he allowed his heir only a brief meeting of a few minutes each year.

He grew increasingly averse to seeing people. He would write his daily meal requirements on a piece of paper, place it on a table in the hall, and have the maid take it to fulfill the order. If the maid was seen by him, she would be dismissed. His favorite dish was leg of lamb. One day, a guest stayed at his home for a meal. The maid asked him from behind the wall what dish to serve the guest. He said, "Naturally, leg of lamb!" The maid anxiously asked, "How can a single leg of lamb be enough?" He frowned and said, "Then two will do!"

He was tall and thin, and his clothes were extremely old-fashioned and rarely changed. When the tailor came to take his measurements, he deliberately put on tattered clothing. He spoke haltingly and always appeared shy and uncomfortable in front of people. Because he feared women, he never married. Only one portrait of him exists, created by an enthusiastic painter who first measured his clothes and hat and then secretly added his facial features.

On February 24, 1810, he died quietly in Clapham. His estate was substantial: seven hundred thousand pounds in cash, eight thousand pounds in annual land revenue, and fifty thousand pounds in his own bank. After his death, his body was buried in All Saints Church in Derby. In 1927, those who revered him erected a monument on his grave to commemorate him.

Cavendish's scientific work was extensive, but he published little during his lifetime. Many of his research findings were made public only after his death. His first contribution to the Royal Society was a chemical treatise titled "Factitious Airs," which mainly discussed "inflammable air" (hydrogen) and "fixed air" (carbon dioxide). He was the first to recognize hydrogen as an element. He determined the specific gravity of the constituent gases of air and their solubility in different liquids. He discovered that the "fixed air" obtained from decay and fermentation had the same properties as the "fixed air" obtained from chalk. He also made significant improvements to scientific experimentation, such as the use of desiccants and the correction of gas volumes for pressure and temperature. Later, he published a paper titled "Analysis of London Water," in which he stated that water containing lime could absorb "fixed air"; lime and "fixed air" combined to form chalk, which could precipitate along with the chalk originally in the water. In 1783, he studied the composition of the atmosphere, spending almost sixty days on the air experiment. In 1781, he concluded that the proportions he had previously obtained were correct and that there was little difference in air from different locations.

Three or four years later, his paper, "Experiments on Air," was published, containing his great discovery: the nature of water and the composition of nitric acid. John Warltire had previously conducted an experiment in which air and hydrogen were mixed and subjected to an electric spark, resulting in a reduction in volume and the formation of water mist. Cavendish meticulously repeated this experiment: burning a mixture of two parts hydrogen and five parts air produced water; he also mixed hydrogen and oxygen in a specially made glass vessel and obtained water by passing an electric spark through it. In this experiment, he discovered that the water produced contained nitric acid. In a second paper, he described his method of discovering the composition of nitric acid. He also found that one-one hundred and twentieth of "incombustible air" was a different gas from the known gases. Argon, discovered a hundred years later, was actually hinted at by him.

Although he believed in the "phlogiston theory," he was not as stubborn as Priestley. His paper "Experiments on Gases" mentioned that many natural phenomena could be explained by Lavoisier's theory. However, he still did not accept Lavoisier's theory, adhering to his "phlogiston theory."

Apart from two unimportant papers, Cavendish's writings on electricity were compiled by James Clerk Maxwell in 1879 as "The Electrical Researches of the Honourable Henry Cavendish." From this book, we can learn that he had anticipated the research work of Coulomb, Faraday, and others. He had studied the capacitance of Leyden jars, the power of static electricity discharge, and had even anticipated Ohm's law!

He also studied heat. If he had published his results quickly, he undoubtedly would have been credited with the discovery of latent heat and specific heat before Joseph Black. In 1783, he published a paper discussing the freezing point of mercury, expressing doubt about the Fluid Theory of Heat. His final achievement was the experiment to determine the density of the Earth, using an instrument given to him by Rev. John Michell. Initially, he thought the density of the Earth was 5.48, but after twenty-nine experiments, the average obtained was 5.448. His later work discussed the height of the aurora and the improvement of astronomical instruments.

George Wilson wrote his biography, which was published in 1851 by the Cavendish Society. It contained all of Cavendish's published and unpublished works. Some of the instruments used by Cavendish are still preserved in the Royal Society. In order to commemorate this sage, the seventh Duke of Devonshire built a "Cavendish Physical Laboratory" for him. He kept Cavendish's surviving works in the Royal Society. In 1921, his previously published and unpublished experiments were compiled into a book called "The Scientific Papers of the Honourable Henry Cavendish," containing two volumes: "Electrical Researches" and "Chemical and Dynamical Researches."

Cavendish was a very great scientist, but unfortunately, his temperament was too eccentric, and he was unwilling to publish in a timely manner, leaving many important discoveries behind, and therefore could not enjoy great fame. Otherwise, I think he might have surpassed Sir Isaac Newton!

### How to Study Philosophy (8)

— Yan Yilin

Fu Shu, published by Sanjiang Bookstore

(3)

The most important characteristic of this book is its objective explanation of philosophical research methods, the summary of the content of philosophy, and the summary of the history of the development of philosophy. Even when explaining what philosophy is as a science or why philosophy should be studied, it uses its objective viewpoint. For example, the explanation given for the word "philosophy" is from an objective standpoint, as can be seen from an accurate and specific description. If you read idealistic philosophy, it begins by leading you into a vague and mysterious world, making it unfathomable. This is naturally not a matter of the reader's level but because its content has no solid basis. If its mystical cloak is removed, the emptiness of its theory cannot be concealed. But this does not mean that idealists deliberately mystify, but because they have not maintained a correct research attitude, and many objective reasons have pushed them onto the forked road of philosophy.

When discussing why philosophy should be studied, the same objective approach is used. The author clarifies that the requirements of philosophical research are caused by the guidance and compulsion of human practical life, and also says that because of writing and practice, there is also a need to study philosophy. This specific statement is fundamentally based on objective aspects.

Because this book discusses research methods from a scientific point of view, it pays special attention to empirical and experimental methods. Therefore, it advocates using an objective mirror in the study of philosophy. To understand the natural philosophy of each era, it requires verifying the truth of the natural things that can be discovered and recognized in that era. To understand the social philosophy of each era, it is necessary to use the mirror of social reality, seeking the essence, form, and theoretical verification of philosophical thought on the social foundation. And it inevitably takes practice as one of the research empirical methods, recognizing practice as the only advanced research method that enables the theoretical system to develop from the inherent stage to a new stage.

This scientific viewpoint is passed through every chapter of the book, which means that the author is standing on the correct standpoint to talk about "How to Study Philosophy" and the summary of philosophical content and its history of development.

Since this book discusses philosophy using scientific research methods, it inevitably contains the meaning of "criticism"; this is also one of the main characteristics of this book. Containing the meaning of "criticism" is a good introductory book. When we read introductory books on various subjects, we often feel a great regret—that is, the content of introductory books often merely piles up many different opinions in a chaotic manner. Its author simply transmits various different sounds like a phonograph, leaving beginners at a loss as to what to follow. Introductory books on philosophy, especially those with complex content, are more prone to this problem. Since this book contains the meaning of "criticism," it will naturally enable beginners to directly enter the door, understand the gains and losses of its basic schools, and not be left to wander aimlessly or be misled by the theories of various schools, not knowing what to follow, or even unfortunately running onto the wrong path.

Another major characteristic of this book is that it unintentionally leads the reader into the correct philosophical thought. This "leadership" effect originally speaks from the correct standpoint and is the inevitable influence given to the reader by an introductory book containing the meaning of "criticism." In fact, it is the author's proper task; an author writes a book and distributes it to the world, naturally wanting it to be beneficial. In particular, so-called introductory books must lead readers into correct thought or give readers basic and systematic knowledge, and only then can it be said to have fulfilled its mission.

The above are the main characteristics of the content of this book. Here, let's examine its formal aspects.

The most important characteristic of the formal aspect is that the form is extremely concise. This can be divided into two aspects: first, in terms of the organization of the entire book, because the order of the narrative follows the correct thread, it feels exceptionally precise. Especially when talking about the outline of philosophy, it is like a botanist wanting to know the age of a tree and seeing the annual rings on the cross-section of the tree trunk, giving the reader a very accurate understanding and understanding of the subject of "philosophy." This book uses extremely few pages to explain the summary of philosophical content: on the one hand, it presents the key points of philosophical content, and on the other hand, it puts forward the views of the two major basic camps of philosophical schools on the fundamental propositions of philosophy. This specific and essential explanation method is undoubtedly the most economical. When explaining the summary of the history of the development of philosophy, the same economical means are used. It makes a new division of the periods of the history of the development of philosophy, which is a reasonable and economical narrative method. Moreover, in the narrative, it constantly pays attention to the historical ups and downs and the progress of the two major schools of idealism and materialism. The second is the compactness and conciseness of the writing. Although it repeatedly explains the research methods of philosophy and the outline of philosophy, when we read it, we only feel its compactness and conciseness because this repetition in explanation is not regression but a higher progression. In short, the compression of the form is often the element of presenting its outline, which increases the reader's attention, and the effect is to quickly give people a correct understanding, so as not to make people fall into a state of confusion due to the chaotic order of the narrative. Therefore, it is said that a good book is determined by the merits of both its content and form, and a beautiful form is also a necessary component of a good book.

Looking at the entire book, the characteristics of the content are: objectively discussing philosophical research methods, outlines, and their history of development; it contains the meaning of "criticism," and it leads the reader into the correct philosophical thought; the characteristic of the formal aspect is that it has an extremely economical form. These characteristics are where its value lies. (End)

### Yuan Changying's The Peacock Flies Southeast and Other Plays (4)

— Kuifeng

2. Other One-Act Plays

D. Overall Play Structure

The conscious effect of Yuan Changying's creation of various one-act plays can be seen roughly in the first section. The epochal significance and value of each play need not be discussed at present.

However, from the current perspective, some places in the technique of criticizing each play cannot be said to be perfect.

If a script is not only used for performance, but also as a script to be read, I can say nothing more. However, there is no playwright who does not hope that it can be performed, otherwise, it loses the meaning of the play itself.

Regrettably, most of these five one-act plays are not suitable for stage techniques. To put it briefly, there are huge problems in plays such as The Living Poet and The Frontline Soldier. In The Living Poet, the section where the yellow dog catches the cat is probably impossible to realize; in The Frontline Soldier, the appearance of Sun Yat-sen's spirit has two such scenes inserted in one act, plus (dimly on the back curtain: suddenly a vast ocean appears; a violent storm and rain at sea compete to rage; thunder and sea roar, shaking people's hearts, on this gloomy and stormy sea, a large ship faintly floats, the ship is full of terrified creatures looking at each other, frowning. The ship is unsteady in the middle of the sea, and there is an obvious danger of sinking, only one rope is on the shore, and a group of people are desperately dragging it. Among the people on the shore, one appears particularly tall and majestic. This is clearly Sun Yat-sen……)

These should belong to stage effects, but such stage effects are often used for revolving stages of Journey to the West-style ghost plays, which cannot be done in spoken drama. At the same time, this kind of play that is close to illusionistic expression is not a technique that spoken drama should use.

Of course, it is not easy to be fair to criticize from the current perspective. However, to mention its obvious shortcomings, even in the situation at the time, it was probably a play that was not suitable for stage performance.

The author's efforts in creating drama can be seen in this booklet. At the time, this achievement of the author was perhaps a very rare harvest. From a historical perspective, Yuan's ability to expose the various aspects of society at that time has its own value that cannot be buried. For such a playwright, we extremely hope that she will continue to work hard and create more scripts that meet the needs of the current era.

Recently, in the Literary and Art section of the Ta Kung Pao, I read a prose poem in the form of a one-act play by Yuan, Lakeside Xuanwu. It is evident that the author has not forgotten the creation of plays. However, the subject matter and expression methods of Lakeside Xuanwu, regardless of whether they meet the needs of the era, the food that the text itself gives us is indeed not enough.

A literary worker who follows the advancement of the times, on the one hand, certainly has his own unique ideals, and on the other hand, should also look back at reality. This is a feeling I have after reading Yuan Changying's new and old plays.

Note: I personally read very little, and I don’t have many opportunities to browse magazines and books. I expect that Yuan has other plays that I have not discovered. The viewpoint of this article should specifically state that it does not summarize all of Yuan's dramatic works. (End)

### "The Story of Money" (Part 1)

— Yupuo

Published by Commercial Press

"The Story of Money" by Norman Angell, the British political commentator and economist, can be called a very valuable and interesting book of common knowledge of economics. There are more than a thousand kinds of books on the records, history, and opinions of money that have been published in the world. However, they are either too specialized in the material, too profound in the viewpoint, or too dry in the writing, and are not easily understood by the general public. Among them, this "Story of Money" does not have the shortcomings of similar books, so it is easy for the general reader to read and understand. Because of the story style and simple language of this book, we can read it in one breath, and it is full of fun. Not only do we know the various situations and stories of ancient and modern money in various parts of the world, but also understand the principles and theories of money, and also gain some common knowledge of economics. Indeed, it has exhausted the functions of interest and knowledge for our readers.

This is not an accidental achievement of the author writing this book, but it is due to his intention, so he can achieve the perfect purpose according to his plan. He clearly stated his writing purpose in the preface: ㊀ The experience of mankind with money; ㊁ Several important experiments of mankind with money and their results; ㊂ The various errors that mankind has made on money. In addition, he has also predetermined such standards for the application of materials: "This book is completely for the general public, and all those that are too specialized in nature will be avoided as much as possible, except when necessary to understand the fundamental problems." He wrote according to his own announced writing purpose and standards, so he was very successful.

Now, let's briefly talk about the content of this book. The book includes fourteen chapters, from the formation of money, the initial money, the lending of money and its interest, the paper money produced with the rented money, to the collapse of modern monetary institutions, and opinions on monetary reform. Everything about the history, phenomena, and all issues of money is discussed, which can be regarded as the ultimate in perfection. Among these chapters, the "First Money" chapter is the most interesting; the author adopts a paper style to explain the definition and function of money, and uses a story style to narrate the forms, materials, and their values and credits of the first money in various parts of the world. As for the author's view on the definition of money, it is quite correct. He said this:

What is called money must have four conditions, namely: ㊀ It can be circulated to pay for the price of goods and their silver; ㊁ When receiving it, it is prepared to pay to others; ㊂ When receiving it, there is no need to give special inspection and occupancy to its quality and quantity; ㊃ When receiving it, there is no need to ask about the credit of the other party. (See page 72)

Originally, the definition of money is the most difficult to explain; this is because it is impossible to summarize all the phenomena of money in one word. However, the author can explain the broad meaning of money from the above four conditions, which can be said to be difficult and valuable. Furthermore, he further supplements the above definition from the function of money, which gives a clearer explanation of his definition. He said:

As for the function of money, the general definition is generally considered to be a medium of transaction, a measure of value, a standard of debt repayment, and a accumulation of value. In other words, those who can fulfill the four functions of medium, scale, standard, and accumulation are money.

Recently, the Lunar New Year is approaching in the blink of an eye. The one-cent auxiliary coin is especially useful for buying and selling and giving change. It is heard that the director Chen Xing has specially ordered the chief engineer to rush to cast coins within the possible range of mechanical power. On weekends and holidays, the machines are working as usual. About 1.6 million one-cent auxiliary coins can be produced every day, which is sufficient for circulation. It is sufficient for the factory to do its best to serve and ensure that there is no shortage of auxiliary coins that the people need most.

### Resolution of the Bone and Ivory Carving Industry Labor Dispute

All Workers Resumed Work Yesterday; Employer Recognizes Unified Wage

The workers in the bone and ivory carving industry went on strike after many shops failed to implement the unified wage, which was agreed upon at the labor-management mutual aid conference of the industry and announced on January 1, 1937. The industry's trade union then petitioned the Party and government authorities and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for assistance. Fearing the expansion of the labor unrest, the higher authorities ordered the trade union members to resume work first and await mediation. After receiving the order, the industry's trade union immediately ordered all workers to resume work yesterday morning. Fang Rusheng, a representative of the Federation of Trade Unions, together with Mi Zengxiang, the employer representative of the industry's labor-management mutual aid association, and Yang Guoliang, the labor representative, went to various shops to persuade them. The shops agreed to stamp their seals and recognize the implementation of the unified wage and to settle the accounts according to the agreement on January 1. The labor dispute was then resolved.

### Directors of the Guangdong-Hankou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways Met Yesterday to Discuss

Solutions for the Shanghai-Guangdong Through Train; Vehicles Will Be Leased from the Wan Guo Company; Expected to Be Implemented in October This Year

The Shenshi News Agency reports that the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong are the essence of Southeast China, with highly developed agriculture, industry, and commerce. Since the opening of the Guangdong-Hankou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Zhejiang-Gan Railways last year, the central provinces have been able to connect, which has had a great impact on regulating inter-provincial finance and developing national economic construction. However, the five provinces have not yet been able to connect by train. Recognizing this, the railway authorities, led by the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, initiated joint transportation on the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou Railways, so that direct through trains could run between Shanghai and Guangzhou, which is very different from the current transportation between Shanghai and Guangdong, which relies solely on foreign merchant ships. This can also recover huge losses.

Meeting Yesterday

The leader of this matter is the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Zhou Zhongqi, the deputy director of the railway, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Du Zhenyuan, the director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Together with the directors of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, they held a meeting at the Railway Building yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter. The attendees included Du Zhenyuan, Zhou Zhongqi, He Molin, and Xiao Weiguo. The following resolutions were made: 1. Joint transportation on the three railways will follow the model of joint transportation between the Shanghai-Nanjing and Tianjin-Pukou Railways. 2. The funding issue will be handled jointly by the three railways. 3. The vehicle allocation will be borne by the three railways, and the application for rental from the Wan Guo Sleeping Car Company will also be made. After reaching an agreement with the Wan Guo Company within a few days, they will jointly formulate measures and submit them to the Ministry of Railways for approval, and then implement them on a scheduled basis.

Shanghai-Guangdong Direct Service

Yesterday, according to Zhou Zhongqi, the director of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau, the issues of joint transportation on the three railways have already been resolved. Once the Qianjiang Railway Bridge project is completed in August of this year, the Shanghai-Guangdong through train service can begin in October of this year. The train service has also been largely decided, with one train departing from Shanghai and Guangzhou every day, aiming for the most complete and fastest speed, completing the entire journey in more than forty hours. The train will pass through Hangzhou, Nanchang, Zhuzhou, and other places, allowing passengers to view the scenery of several southeastern provinces of China. Therefore, it is expected that this route will definitely develop in the future.

Hangzhou-Yushan Track Replacement

As for the issue of replacing the tracks on the Hangzhou-Yushan section with heavy rails, it is also being actively carried out due to the operation of through trains. According to Du Zhenyuan, the director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, the first batch of rail materials for the track replacement on the Hangzhou-Yushan section will arrive in Hangzhou in March, the second batch in April, and the last batch in June. By October, the replacement will be completely completed. Currently, the reconstruction of bridges on the Hangzhou-Yushan section with steel and concrete is progressing rapidly. It is heard that the business of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was quite prosperous last year and is expected to develop even more in the future.

### Liu Hangchen Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

Liu Hangchen, the Director of Finance of the Sichuan Provincial Government, recently went to Nanjing from Shanghai to report on the financial situation of the province to the authorities. Having completed his official duties, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. He is expected to stay for two or three days and then return to Sichuan with Fu Zhenwu, the Chief of Staff of the Sixth Route Army Headquarters.

### Death of Austrian Consul Walter Mühler

The Austrian Consul in Shanghai, Walter Mühler, passed away at his residence on Anhe Temple Road in the French Concession yesterday morning due to illness, at the age of 50. Mühler had been ill for a long time and had been unable to go to the consulate on Sichuan Road to work. His remains were sent to the International Funeral Home for cremation that day. His wife is currently living in Shanghai and has no children. Mühler had lived in Shanghai for 18 years and was well-known among the Austrian community. He also served as the director of the export department of the Lu Lin Trading Company for many years.

### Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Withholding Income Tax Should Follow the Example of the Silver and Money Industry

Various Chambers of Commerce Jointly Send a Telegram Request

Representatives from the Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxian, and 14 other chambers of commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing the other day, stating: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, the silver and money industry is allowed to deduct 10/1000 as a handling fee from the 50/1000 tax rate for withholding income from savings interest. This has already been implemented in Shanghai. Our associations believe that other companies, businesses, factories also receive savings deposits and have the same responsibility of withholding. The method should be uniform. We request that the Ministry approve the handling of the silver and money industry by analogy, to show fairness. Awaiting instructions, the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce, Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, Changshu County Chamber of Commerce, Qingpu County Chamber of Commerce, Kunshan County Chamber of Commerce, Fengxian County Chamber of Commerce, Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, Yixing County Chamber of Commerce, Wujin County Chamber of Commerce, Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, representatives attending the Income Tax Research Association, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully kowtow."

### National Mining Survey and Statistics of the China Mining Association

In order to understand the domestic mining situation, the Mining Association of the Republic of China conducted a large-scale survey last year. It has now been compiled into a detailed table. The table lists a total of 143 mining companies, with coal mines accounting for the majority, followed by tin mines. Other metal mines, such as lead, copper, manganese, antimony, etc., are even rarer. The total amount of capital, excluding nine companies that did not list it, reached a total of National Currency 103,824,953.60 yuan, plus English gold 4,264,328 pounds and Hong Kong currency 337,550 yuan. China is rich in mineral resources, and less than one-tenth of them are currently being developed. At this time of active construction, we must rely on the continued efforts of the Chinese people. Based on the information obtained from the association's survey, statistics are compiled and described as follows:

Types of Mineral Deposits

During the survey, the association first sent letters to the construction departments of various provinces to find out that there were no fewer than 900 mining companies under their jurisdiction. Then, they sent survey forms to each company separately. They gradually received responses from 143 companies. The larger-scale mines in the country have not been missed. As for the small and medium-sized mines, or those that have just been established, or those that have been suspended midway, or those that have changed addresses, it was not possible to fully investigate them all. However, by compiling statistics on the mines that have already been investigated, we can see a general overview of China's mining industry. Among the 143 companies, coal mines account for 62%, tin mines account for 11%, iron mines account for 3%, tungsten mines account for 6%, other metal mines account for 8%, and stone mines account for 9%. The total amount of capital for each type is: coal mines total more than 98.1 million yuan, tin mines total more than 3.3 million yuan, and although there are only two gold mines, they also have 1.4 million yuan. Stone mines and other metal mines are relatively few.

Distribution of Each Mine

First, let's talk about coal mines. The distribution is the most in Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and Hebei, followed by Sichuan, with nine companies. However, their scale is not large, and the highest capital is only 50,000 yuan. Hubei and Anhui provinces are next. There are also one or two in Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Chahar, Guangdong, Hunan, Guizhou, Suiyuan, Yunnan, etc. Calculating the amount of investment in coal mines in each province, Hebei Province has the most, with 21,160,000 yuan and 3,400,000 pounds. Shandong Province is second, with 15,370,000 yuan. Henan and Shanxi provinces each have 11-12 million yuan. In this high tide of developing North China, the development of its business still needs to be self-planned, so as not to have its rights encroached upon by others. As for all coal mines, the production and sales volume in the previous two years was: 13,203,47 tons produced in 1934 and 11,812,465 tons sold; 14,015,527 tons produced in 1935 and 13,640,735 tons sold.

Mine Production and Sales Volume

The production and sales volume of other mines are as follows: Iron mines produced 589,482 tons and sold 563,425 tons in 1934; produced 728,874 tons and sold 720,525 tons in 1935. Tin mines produced 2,204 tons and sold 1,564 tons in 1934; produced 2,272 tons and sold 1,822 tons in 1935. Placer gold produced 20 taels and sold 16.94 taels in 1934; produced 8.66 taels and sold 10.13 taels in 1935. Other metals such as lead, steel, antimony, and manganese produced 48,838 tons and sold 38,318 tons in 1934; produced 26,347 tons and sold 43,481 tons in 1935. Stone mines produced 64,496 tons and sold 20,623 tons in 1934; produced 28,249 tons and sold 18,582 tons in 1935. China's tin production is known for the Gejiu tin mine in Yunnan Province, with a capital of 2 million yuan. It produced 700 tons in 1934 and 600 tons in 1935, all of which were sold abroad. In Guangxi Province, there are 14 tin mines, with a total capital of more than 12 million yuan, most of which were recently established, which shows the province's efforts in developing the mining industry.

He Yuanming was elected as chairman.

Chairman's Report

After the formalities, Chairman He Yuanming first reported on the significance of initiating the organization, stating that various industry associations in Shanghai, in view of the fact that the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules of our country have been promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government on October 1st of last year, and have begun to be levied from the 1st of this month, all our companies, businesses, shops, factories, or individual capital of more than 2,000 yuan, and freelance professionals, etc., have the obligation to pay taxes. At the time when the new tax is being levied, people across the country are deeply concerned. However, it is feared that the people of the country cannot fully know the relevant laws and regulations, and the tax collection procedures are extremely cumbersome, the calculation methods are very complicated, and the accounting issues are particularly important. If there is any negligence, the gains and losses will be significant. However, up to now, there is no widespread research group on income tax accounting issues. Therefore, we have gathered colleagues from various industries to initiate the organization of the Income Tax Accounting Problem Research Association, with the aim of researching income and contributing opinions to the government authorities, while also enabling colleagues themselves to understand how to declare taxes. Countries such as the United States have been implementing income tax for a long time, but they still have amendments every year. At the beginning of our country's implementation, how to solve all the problems that arise needs to be jointly researched and discussed. Therefore, the association has the necessity of organization and the value of permanent existence. After He's report, accountant Xia Sunhuan delivered a speech on income tax accounting issues. The original words were very long and are omitted.

Election of Preparatory Members

Immediately, Luo Qinghua, He Yuanming, Shen Weiting, Zhao Erchang, Ba Lingyun, Wang Lianfang, Luo Zhenhua, Song Zhongqing, Sun Wuqi, Jin Chuxiang, Hong Songqing, Hu Shouqi, Zhu Yangwu, Li Qingfan, Wang Yucheng, Zhang Dafu, Yuan Hongwen, Xie Cufu, Zhu Ya Kui, Wang Jingdong, Fu Youming, and 21 other people were elected as preparatory members. It was also decided to hold the first preparatory meeting at 1:00 PM on the first of next month, which will be convened by He Mingjun.

### Continuation of Special Cash Guarantee Method

The Bank Association publishes the full text

Summary of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" 1. Type A Guarantee Deposit (calculated based on three times the monthly salary of the employee)

The principal will be fully refunded when the employee leaves the bank, and the interest will be calculated at an annual rate of 1.2%, with half paid to the employee and half used for public reserve funds.

2. Type B Guarantee Deposit (calculated based on 2% of the employee's monthly salary)

This guarantee deposit is a substitute for canceling the guarantor, which is equal to the guarantee fee for group credit. It is not necessary to refund this amount, but out of consideration for the employees, if there is no case of fraud, it can be fully recovered when leaving the bank, or the balance can be recovered after deduction of compensation.

3. Internal Guarantee Deposit: The Bank of China authorities have approved several million yuan, or the sum of half of the interest on Type A guarantee deposits and the full amount of Type B guarantee deposits. According to the above three public reserve funds for guarantee deposits, assuming that the total number of employees in the entire bank is 1,800 and the total annual salary is 1.6 million yuan, more than 100,000 yuan can be obtained in the first year. After five years, including interest, approximately 800,000 yuan can be obtained.

4. Joint and Several Penalties: After an employee fraud case occurs, other employees in the same branch who have one of the following circumstances shall be subject to joint and several penalties. The method shall be handled in accordance with the regulations on employee rewards and punishments.

I. Those who handle the job jointly or jointly with the same branch.

II. The direct supervisor of the same branch.

III. Other persons who are determined by the chairman and general manager to be subject to joint and several penalties.

5. Reward for Reporting: If an employee fraud is discovered or reported by the supervisor and other employees, so that the bank is not subject to or reduces losses, the discoverer or reporter shall be exempt from joint and several penalties, and the bank shall also reward them. The method shall be handled in accordance with the regulations on employee rewards and punishments. However, if the reported case is found to be untrue, it shall be punished by the authorities.

Plan of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method"

Employee Service Guarantee Rules

Article 1: The guarantee of employee service in this bank shall be handled in accordance with these rules.

The term "employee" in the preceding paragraph refers to all employees of the bank.

(Explanation) The second paragraph of this article is the definition of an employee, which clearly defines the scope and object of the implementation of these rules in order to prevent disputes in interpretation during implementation.

Article 2: Employees shall pay a Type A guarantee deposit in the amount of three times their monthly salary.

(Explanation) The characteristic of this method is to cancel the guarantor, so a considerable amount of cash must be paid to guarantee the amount. The amount is set at three times the monthly salary, which is not too high. In fact, there is no difficulty in making it easier than finding a guarantor, and part of the guarantee deposit and interest (see Article 5) can be returned in the future. It is beneficial to the employees themselves, with no loss. Assuming that the total annual salary is 1.6 million yuan, the bank will collect more than 400,000 yuan in guarantee deposits and obtain more than 24,000 yuan in annual interest, which will be used as part of the bank's reserve fund for preventing fraud losses. The guarantee can be said to be consolidated. (It is said that the British Midland Bank also has similar methods).

In order to consolidate the guarantee, the limit of Type A guarantee deposit can be stipulated to pay one year or half a year's salary, but it is feared that at this time of extreme social and economic distress, most employees with ordinary family backgrounds will find it difficult to raise funds, so after careful consideration of the situation, it is stipulated that it will be three times the monthly salary in order to be practical and easy to implement. If there is still concern that employees will find it difficult to raise funds, the previously deducted savings can be used, or deducted from the year-end bonus, or paid in installments.

Article 3: Employees shall not be assigned to a position until they have paid the total amount of Type A guarantee deposit as stipulated in the preceding article.

(Explanation) This article is exactly the same as the nature of Article 2 of the current guarantee rules. Since the strong rules require employees to comply, and the special cash guarantee system is a newly created method, in order to be effective, it must be strictly enforced, so they must wait until the Type A guarantee deposit is paid before they can be assigned to a position.

Article 4: The head office shall issue a Type A guarantee deposit passbook to the employee for the Type A guarantee deposit paid by the employee. This passbook shall not be transferred or mortgaged.

(Explanation) Issuing a guarantee deposit passbook is a certificate for the bank to receive the guarantee deposit. Prohibiting transfer or mortgage is to protect the consolidation of the guarantee deposit.

Article 5: The employee's Type A guarantee deposit shall be stored in a special account by the head office, and the interest shall be calculated at an annual rate of 1.2%, compounded every six months. However, the interest to which the employee is entitled shall be 0.6% per annum, and the remaining 0.6% shall be allocated to the employee guarantee reserve fund (see Article 11 of these rules).

(Explanation) Because half of the interest on the Type A guarantee deposit must be used for the employee reserve fund, the bank has specially increased the interest rate so that the employees will not suffer any losses. Both parties will be taken into consideration, and when the bank interest rate is reduced in the future, it can also be appropriately reduced to the stipulated amount. Half of the gold interest is allocated to the employee guarantee interest, so that the guarantee deposit paid by the employee will not be completely shelved. Half of the guarantee deposit is used to increase the strength of the guarantee.

Article 6: If there is an increase or decrease in the employee's salary grade or a change in position, the amount of the Type A guarantee deposit shall be increased or decreased separately in accordance with the provisions of Article 2.

(Explanation) Since the amount is stipulated to be three times the monthly salary, if there is any change in the employee's salary grade or position, the amount of the guarantee shall be increased or decreased accordingly. (To be continued)

### Fire on Rue Pesson Last Night, Elderly Woman Burned to Death

Old Woman's Sister Jumps from Building and is Seriously Injured, Niece Missing, Fire Spreads to Neighboring House

At around 7:00 pm last night, a fire broke out at No. 19, Lane Yu Kang, Rue Pesson, French Concession. An elderly woman from Ningbo was burned to death on the spot. The elderly woman's sister jumped from the building and was seriously injured. One niece of the elderly woman is missing. The fire also spread to the residents of No. 13 next door. Details are recorded below.

Ten Families Living in One House

No. 14, Lane Yu Kang, No. 19, Rue Pesson, French Concession, is a single two-story Shikumen building. The second landlord is a man from Ningbo, Chen Long, who works in the shipping industry. He is currently in Hong Kong and has not returned. The second landlord, in addition to living in the front building on the second floor, rents out all the other vacant houses, and even adds a third floor on the second floor, which is also rented to people. There are as many as ten families living there.

Old Woman Too Miserable

The front building on the added third floor is rented to Liu Quansheng (62 years old), a local resident. Liu used to run a paper shop, but is currently unemployed and suffers from a serious illness. He is staying in the hospital for treatment and has not yet been discharged. Liu had an affair with an elderly woman from Ningbo, Ms. Lu, 56 years old, nineteen years ago. According to her, the woman is from Shipu, Ningbo, and her mother's family name is Wang, named Tianxiang. She later married a man named Lu and had a son named Zhongkun, 32 years old, who is currently in prison in Ningbo for a crime and his sentence has not yet expired.

Fire Suddenly Breaks Out in the Living Room

The woman and Liu have been in an affair for as long as nineteen years, and have been living together. They have moved to Lane Yu Kang for several years. The woman's sister and niece, Xiao Xiang (23 years old), also live there. At 7:30 last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the living room of the house in the back. At the time, there were several tenants playing mahjong upstairs. When they heard the alarm and rushed down, the ladder had already been burned. Everyone fled separately, and the order was in chaos.

Buried in the Fire

At the time, the elderly woman, Ms. Lu, was in the room. When she heard the alarm, she planned to go downstairs to escape, but the woman was fat and had small feet, and was unable to escape. She was buried in the fire. The woman's sister also jumped from the building and was seriously injured. Fire brigade members first took the woman's sister to the hospital for treatment, and then tried to pull out Ms. Lu's body and carry it to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan branch to wait for a report to the Second Special District Court for examination. After the fire was extinguished, one of Ms. Lu's nieces, Xiao Xiang, was still missing.

Rumors About the Cause of the Fire

As for the cause of the fire, it is said that an eight-year-old girl living in the back living room was careless when burning a kerosene stove, causing the disaster. The police are currently investigating. In addition, the fire also spread to No. 13 next door, which was also completely destroyed.

### Hongkou Police Crack Down on Counterfeit Currency Gang

Organized by Brazilian and Polish Immigrants, Japanese National Hasegawa Taken to Court for Interrogation

A certain Japanese national reported to the Hongkou Police that a Brazilian immigrant, Abete Erfang Denghuilimu Tuiji, a Polish immigrant, Airike Zhangdamenggu, and a Polish woman, Yaolaipaituole Nai, were planning to jointly counterfeit Central Bank banknotes. At 4:30 pm the day before yesterday, detectives from China, the West, and Japan were dispatched to No. 12, Lane 34, Haining Road to arrest the four men and women.

And Arrested Them Together

A steel printing press, an iron, two large and small glass bottles filled with liquid, and wooden boxes and clothes boxes were found in the residences of the men in No. 91 and No. 519, Huanlong Road, French Concession. In addition, there were also two Central Bank one-yuan banknotes, and their numbers were exactly the same. After careful examination, it was discovered that the last digit of the A ticket number was washed off with chemical water and filled in with the digit 3, so it was consistent with the

B Ticket Number

Yesterday morning, the police escorted the captured criminals and various exhibits to the First Special District Court, where Judge Ye Shengchao opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the case and requested that the criminals be punished in accordance with Article 329 of the Criminal Law. Then the witness, Japanese national Hasegawa Kiyoshi, appeared in court and testified about the details of contacting the defendant to counterfeit banknotes. He roughly said that he

Lives on Haining Road

No. 12, Lane 20. A few days ago, he met Huilimu Tuiji in the French Concession, who said that he was good at making counterfeit banknotes, and introduced the other defendants to meet. He also took out a Central Bank one-yuan banknote, one of which had its number altered. The people then incited him to cooperate and asked him to raise 5,000 yuan to start counterfeiting. Because he had little money, he discussed this plan with his

Wealthy

Friends, and agreed to meet with the defendants at No. 12, Lane 24, Haining Road at 4:30 pm yesterday afternoon. He reported to the police at the same time and was arrested together. However, after being questioned in court, all four defendants confessed that they were using the name of making counterfeit banknotes to lure the Japanese national's money, saying that the Japanese had recently been selling heroin and other drugs in the French Concession to poison the people. One day, at No. 95 of a certain place

In the Swallow's Nest

He met Hasegawa Kiyoshi who came to sell heroin. They were moved and used the excuse that they could make counterfeit banknotes to lure him into cooperation, so as to swindle money from him. In fact, they were not real counterfeiters, so all the objects were temporarily prepared, etc. Judge Ye verified the confession and said that the case still needed to be investigated, and ordered the defendants to be detained and interrogated again next Monday.

Reported in the Newspaper

The Japanese-language Daily News said that since the Shanghai Incident, counterfeit banknotes have been rampant in the streets, and victims have been heard one after another. The Japanese Consulate General's Police Department, after secretly investigating, suddenly arrested five criminals, Japanese national Hasegawa, Persians Fuden and Taiqi, Polish national Menige, and Romanian Badrna, etc., on the 26th by Koenoi criminal and other officials, together with the Hongkou Patrol Room, inside Bao Yuan Fang No. 12, Haining Road. The criminals used tracing as the basis and changed the ten-yuan banknote to twenty-yuan, and Hasegawa also talked a lot to the Japanese that he had obtained the world's only medicine from India, which could turn a one-yuan banknote into two banknotes, inducing the Japanese to invest 30,000 yuan, after which he could make a fortune, etc., by means of blackmail. In addition to escorting the four foreigners to the Special District Court, Hasegawa was detained at the Japanese Consulate General.

### New Games Notice Movie Theaters to Add Party, National Flag, and Premier Images

Utilize the Opportunity to Cultivate People's Patriotic Enthusiasm

The New Life Movement Promotion Association believes that movies have a great influence on social education. Therefore, it has specially ordered that each movie theater add party, national flag, and Premier and Chairman leader images before each show, and broadcast the party song and stand up to pay tribute, in order to cultivate people's patriotic enthusiasm. The New Games Association of this city has sent letters to the movie theaters in this city for implementation yesterday. The original letter is recorded below. The sender respectfully states that he has received the New Life Movement Promotion Association's Yun Zi 123 official letter, which states, "It has been found that movies have a profound impact on social education. Some movie theaters play foreign national anthems or other improper songs at the opening or closing of the show. From the standpoint of national education, it is a great loss of opportunity. In order to cultivate the people's patriotic enthusiasm, the following procedure can be added to the opening of each movie theater in the future, depending on the situation of the film being shown on that day: 1. Party and National Flag, 2. Premier's Image, 3. National Government Chairman's Image, 4. Leader's Image, and play the national anthem (party song) at the same time to make the audience stand up and pay tribute. After the ceremony is completed, the official film will be shown. I hope that your association will inform the movie theaters to implement it." In addition to sending letters separately, corresponding letters are sent, and I hope your theater will implement it.

### The Ye FuKang Case: Court Detains Wang Hanqing

Witness Hu Jinkun's Testimony: The Judge Finds It Too Bizarre

Ye FuKang, a former judge of the Shanghai Local Court and a lawyer, was accused by Wang Han卿 in the Ministry of Justice of embezzling huge sums of money under the guise of defense. The case was handed over to Tang Ruxiu, a prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court, for investigation and prosecution. After repeated trials in the criminal court, Wang Hanxiang suddenly requested withdrawal during the trial, admitting to making false accusations. Considering the matter unusual, the court ordered Wang to appear, but he avoided doing so, making it impossible to interrogate and judge. Yesterday, Judge Lu continued the trial, with witness Hu Jinkun appearing in court. The judge asked: "You said last time that lawyer Gu Ao used a 20,000-yuan receipt as a guarantee for Ye FuKang's settlement, but Gu said in court that there was no such thing." Hu replied: "The settlement negotiations were at Gu's place, and Gu came to the Da Yi apartment a second time to discuss it." The judge asked: "Why haven't you found Wang Hanxiang as you were instructed?" Hu replied: "I went to Hankou on November 27th and ran into Wang at Mao Yongji Inn in Dazhimen on the 28th. I immediately asked him how his lawsuit with Ye FuKang was going and suggested that he come to Shanghai with me. He said that his wife, Wang Zhangshi, was not dead, but he was divorced from Wang. As for the details of the case, Wang needed to ask his scribe to inquire with Wang Zhangshi before coming to Shanghai. We agreed to go to Shanghai together on the 30th, but unexpectedly, when I went on the 29th, Wang Hanxiang avoided meeting me again. I returned to Shanghai on January 12th and don't know if the withdrawal papers were filed." The judge asked Wang Fuyou about Wang Zhangshi's whereabouts. Wang replied that he didn't know. The judge said: "What you're saying is too bizarre. Wang Hanxiang sent a withdrawal paper immediately after you arrived in Hankou. Weren't you just going to get this paper?" Wang replied: "I don't know anything about it." The court adjourned the case for another hearing and sent a letter to Hankou to request assistance in interrogating Wang.

### The Zheng YiZhi Family Estate Lawsuit

The Property Is Managed by Younger Brothers; Concubine Sues the Court for Liquidation

Zheng 鎰zhi from Chaozhou started his career by operating special businesses, accumulating considerable wealth, not less than a million. He married a woman from his hometown, Zhou, who gave birth to a son named Guo Kai, currently over twenty years old. At the time, he also took Zhang Shuyun, a woman from Shanghai, as a concubine, who also gave birth to a son and a daughter. The son's name is Guo Xiao, currently twelve years old, and the daughter Yue Zhen, currently fifteen years old. Zheng 鎰zhi died of illness in the winter of 1924. At that time, the children were still young, so he entrusted all his property to his brothers Zheng Qiting, Zheng 鎰zhi, Zheng Zuo, and Zheng Jian for joint management. After Zheng Qiting and others accepted the will, they determined that Liu would pay Zhang Shuyun and her children 300 yuan per month for living expenses, to be withdrawn by voucher. Later, it was increased to 4,000 yuan per year. Recently, Zhang Shuyun, seeing that her children had grown up, claimed that her uncles and others had not reported any accounts for the property they had been managing for more than ten years. Therefore, she asked Zheng Zhan Ting and others to hand over the accounts for liquidation. However, Zheng and others suddenly claimed that they had not managed Zheng 鎰zhi's property. Zhang had no choice but to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, together with her children, through lawyer Du Xi against Zheng Qiting, Zheng Jian, Zheng Zuo, Zheng Hui, Zheng Zhou, and Zheng Guo Kai, demanding the handover and liquidation of accounts. The court accepted the case, and yesterday, Judge Luo Can opened the Civil Fourth Court for interrogation. Zheng Zhou and Zheng Guo Kai were absent, while the remaining defendants also retained lawyers to appear in court. They denied managing the inheritance. However, the plaintiff's lawyer presented evidence that the defendants were still managing Zheng 鎰zhi's property in Leyu Lane. After Judge Luo's interrogation, he ordered the case to be adjourned for another hearing.

### Shi Xiangyun's Father Dies; His Concubine Gives Birth to Triplets

Xiangzhen's Brother Believes It Dishonors the Family and Files a Lawsuit with the Court to Dissolve the Relationship

Shi Xiangyun, a veteran female Suzhou opera singer, has performed at the Great World, New World, and other amusement venues in this city, and is quite famous for singing Kunqu opera. She lives at No. 46 Tongkang Lane, opposite the Slaughterhouse in the French Concession. Recently, Shi Xiangyun was about to marry someone surnamed Lin, and the wedding preparations were underway, but the performances were suspended and she stayed at home. Her brother, Shi Xiaoyun, also known as Shi Qingtang, is in a troupe with a woman named Wu Lanying and broadcasts Suzhou opera on various radio stations.

Singing Suzhou Opera

He lives with his sister Xiangyun in the same place. Shi's father, Shi Xikang, is deceased. During his lifetime, he was over sixty years old when he took a woman named Leng as a concubine more than ten years ago. Leng is thirty-one years old this year. After giving birth, she had a daughter named Lanbin, who is twelve years old this year. Since entering the Shi family, Leng has also learned to sing Suzhou opera. After mastering the art, she took the stage name Shi Feixia and performed in the same troupe as Shi Xiangyun and others, also singing Kunqu opera.

Important Supporting Role

After Shi Xikang died of illness last spring, Leng suddenly changed her mind and behaved improperly. She became pregnant and gave birth earlier this month. She went to the Zhongde Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital for delivery. Unexpectedly, she gave birth to triplets, one male and two female, but two died and one survived. Leng rented a residence at No. 47 Fuzhifang in Changxing Lane, Belle Road, after completing her confinement. Shi Qingtang, Shi Xiangyun's brother, believes that the son

Born to Leng

Is not a descendant of the Shi family and that it is a disgrace to the family and affects the reputation. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Shi Leng Feixia and her son to dissolve the relationship. The court responded to the lawsuit, and Judge Liao Yuan visited the Seventh Civil Court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to hear the case. The defendant was absent. According to the lawyer representing the district's notification, "Our lawyer has learned that the defendant in this case has appointed a lawyer to represent them and should request an adjournment for another hearing," etc. After reviewing the words in court, it was ruled that the hearing would be adjourned to February 4 for another hearing.

### Public Works Bureau Road Workers Held a Representative Meeting Yesterday

Describing Seven Reasons and Arguing Reasonably; Issued a Declaration Appealing to All Sectors for Assistance

The Great Gongshe reports that the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, in order to implement cost savings, will lay off nine-tenths of the Chinese road workers, which will leave more than 1,200 workers in the district unemployed. The public is panicked. In addition to submitting petitions to various parties the day before yesterday, a general representative meeting was convened yesterday afternoon. Many resolutions were discussed and a declaration was issued. Details are recorded below.

Representative Meeting: Over a hundred road worker representatives from the Public Works Bureau, including Liu Huanwen, Wang Shuangfang, and Huan Buying, held a meeting at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Liu Huanwen was elected as chairman and the ceremony was performed. The chairman reported on the reduction of government personnel by the Public Works Department. All workers requested to organize a mutual aid association. The chairman then submitted it for discussion. The following motions are recorded: ㊀ How should road workers defend themselves against the sudden layoff by the Public Works Bureau? It was resolved: (A) To organize the Shanghai Public Concession Road Workers Mutual Aid Association, (B) To issue a declaration, (C) To petition and appeal to party and government agencies and various groups, (D) To send a letter to the Public Works Bureau requesting them to withdraw their order, (E) To pass the declaration and draft, (F) To appoint Liu Shuowen and 14 others as executive committee members. ㊁ How should we advocate for the Public Works Bureau to withdraw their order? It was resolved: To argue reasonably based on the following seven reasons: 1. For government staff reduction, senior staff with monthly salaries of thousands or hundreds of dollars should be reduced. 2. The tightening of the social economy is actually due to the increase in the unemployed population. 3. Recently, the road lines have been lengthened and the road surfaces have been widened, increasing the amount of work. 4. The number of vehicles is increasing daily, and the roads are easily damaged and require more repairs. 5. The original workers have tasted the wind and rain and braved gunfire during the January 28th Incident, risking their lives for the cause. 6. Recently, wages in various industries have increased, but road workers have not requested an increase in wages. 7. Frequent recruitment of workers has many malpractices and is not easy to assemble at once. ㊁ How should assistance be provided if laid off before the reorganization plan is resolved? It was resolved: If one person is laid off, all work will be stopped. The meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM.

Declaration: I, a road worker serving in the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau for decades, have been tasting the wind and rain, working diligently, morning and night, paving roads, to achieve today's prosperity in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, we have suddenly suffered a complete elimination by the Bureau. Looking back on the past, we cannot overcome our indignation. Considering the future, we cannot overcome our sadness. The Bureau has stubbornly adhered to its nature, and the workers have no effect from their appeals. We have no choice but to rise up with powerful organizations and resolutely oppose the Bureau's unreasonable oppression. We hope that all sectors will advance and teach us, not let us become displaced. It is a great fortune. According to the Bureau's excuse, laying off workers is due to reducing expenditures. However, in reality, the salaries of over a thousand road workers are not as much as the benefits of nearly ten senior foreign employees of the Bureau. If we really want to reduce expenditures, we should also reduce the generous salaries of senior foreign employees. Why must we make thousands of workers unemployed and increase social unrest? Therefore, making it difficult for us low-level Chinese workers is unreasonable in one way. As far as road administration is concerned, the road lines are gradually lengthening, the road surfaces are gradually widening, and the railway engineering is becoming more and more complicated due to the increase in vehicles. It seems that only road workers should be added, but why is there a layoff? It is really unreasonable in two ways. In view of the recent situation of workers in various industries requesting wage increases, but our road workers are still working as usual, the people who are safe, self-conscious, and have no faults are still suffering from unemployment. This is unreasonable in three ways. During the January 28th Shanghai War, all the defense projects were completed by our road workers braving the gunfire. The injured and the dead are a matter of fact. Now, with a cruel heart, those who are loyal to their duties and have made contributions have not been given any consideration. This is unreasonable in four ways. In short, the Bureau's arbitrary layoff of our road workers is unreasonable and is based on the concept of contempt for our Chinese people. When we are recruited for work, we are now ordered to leave, and we believe that we are of no importance and helpless. But we workers will never degrade our personality or harm the national system. We must unite and argue reasonably. We will not give up until we achieve fair treatment and a reasonable solution. I hereby post my sincerity and hope that the public will understand.

### Japan's Leap Forward

— Wen

In neighboring Japan, the current 70th session of the Diet has stirred up a great storm. The result was the resignation of the cabinet. The military, as the main force behind this change, stated in their published opinions on politics that the future cabinet must be able to correctly recognize the times to facilitate Japan's leap forward. We cannot but pay attention to the "leap forward" of our friendly neighbor.

When it comes to the history of Japan's modern leap forward, some aspects certainly make people have to admire it. With the Sino-Japanese War, plus the Russo-Japanese War, and the opportunity of the European War from 1914 to 1918, Japan developed at a rapid pace. Today, it also has another "Manchurian Utopia," with "30 million people, without suffering or worry," as its huge appendage. Looking at the current situation, it has developed to the point where it can no longer develop. However, with this consistent military victory-driven leap forward, it has also attracted more enemies at home and abroad. For example, domestically, it has sacrificed the people's minimum living requirements to maintain its excessive military budget, which is more than that of other countries. Abroad, not to mention the United States and the Soviet Union, even Britain, which has always been friendly before and after the European War, also feels uncomfortable with it. More importantly, whether China will remain silent for a long time is an even bigger problem, causing Japan, in the midst of its leap forward, to worry day and night and be unable to sleep soundly. All of this shows that along with Japan's rapid leap forward, on the other hand, are terrible domestic and foreign threats. This situation, of course, cannot make Japan, which is in the midst of its leap forward, retreat halfway. The only way is to seek even more leap forward. There is a Chinese saying that goes, "If you don't do it, don't do it; if you do it, do it thoroughly." Another saying goes, "It's hard to get off a tiger's back." The only way is to drive the tiger to devour people. The Japanese military's reason for wanting even more leap forward at a time when Japan has nothing more to leap forward is for this reason.

Putting aside ethnic hatred, from a cultural point of view, Japan's rapid progress in recent centuries cannot but make us admire it. It is also for this reason that we are very sorry for the Western culture that Japan has accepted in recent years, given that Japan has taken a path of having to leap forward even further and being unable to get off a tiger's back in the past ten years or so. In the past, Japan accepted foreign culture, and it was considered one of the most active and advanced countries in the world. Many of our people indirectly inherited Western culture from Japanese culture. But now, as Mr. Zhou Zuoren said, "There is only militarization to speak of." Those who want Japan to leap forward into military adventure do not feel that it is sad, but from the standpoint of pure culture, hopeful Japanese thinkers and cultural workers cannot but regard it as a painful thing.

We are very worried about the extremely dangerous future of the friendly neighbor's national policy, which is being led by military adventurism. However, this worry must first be directed at ourselves. Looking at Japan's leap forward in the future, there will be no other path. If there is, it is our vast divine land. Here, galloping horses and wielding spears are enough for the friendly neighbor's army to show its power. Come on, other places are full of thorns, but this is the only smooth road! However, whether it can be smooth to the end, please be careful first, and don't "an old woman of sixty binding a child," or you will regret it too late!

### Kowloon City

— Yu Lu

From Hong Kong, taking a ferry to Yau Ma Tei or Tsim Sha Tsui, you can transfer to a "bus" to Kowloon City.

People who come to Hong Kong for sightseeing will probably always hear locals introducing this place:

"Let's go see the Sung Wong Toi! Also, don't forget to eat wontons in Kowloon City, which are very famous. Moreover, there are also the oil vegetables or white flower kale that have just been picked from the fields, which are even more delicious...

Cantonese people love to eat, and scenic spots often start with "eating." Saying this, people will naturally be moved. Because in Guangzhou, perhaps tourists will still miss the fresh vegetables from the fields in Xiaobei and Shahe. Therefore, as long as you have heard this introduction, you will always want to go to such a place to play for a while. So, without any difficulties, as long as you have money, you can set off.

On the bus, we crossed the road and came to the suburbs. Strangers are most likely to mistake Kowloon Tong for Kowloon City, because the names are so similar. However, as long as you are a humble tourist, the bus ticket seller is often the best guide.

Along the way, we saw the yellow mud hills that were being mined, and also saw the fields. Thus, we were heading towards Kowloon City.

When the bus arrived at the station, a gentle, evergreen field stretched across the front. The first thing that caught our eye was often the very large advertisement sign made of leather for the ×× Airport. It tells ordinary Chinese people that there is a "Royal" airport there, and the airport has an aviation school, as long as you have money, the certificate signed by the Royal can be obtained after the "training period is over"—but, you must understand: Kowloon City is not a concession.

After getting off the bus, the pleasant wind of the fields will give you a fresh smell. For the nose and respiratory organs that have been smoked by the coal smoke of the city, this will give you a different and indescribably comfortable compensation. Thatched cottages and simple houses are also not seen in this gorgeous Hong Kong. In a vulgar word, this is completely "Chinese flavor" (Note). Precisely because of this, perhaps the pleasure it gives people will exceed everything in this island port.

——Isn't this just the countryside?

Yes. It is the countryside, a territory coveted by others. It, this countryside that is a bit reminiscent of paradise, is now, just because it is close to Hong Kong and the Kowloon Peninsula, which are concessions, also suffering from the general fate of our country——being bullied and invaded.

However, casual passers-by will not think of these things, they will just conveniently ask people: Where is the place to eat?

The place to eat is a small village tea house-like thatched cottage. The front door can be seen from the back door. It is very small, and the equipment is also very simple. There are several wooden tables and some haphazard benches. There is no boasting advertisement, and even the signboard is omitted. However, what is enough to call people is the vegetable field surrounding the small shop on three sides. The rapeseed flowers in the field are blooming vigorously, and the appearance is already tempting enough. On the other side is the front door, facing the main road; the back door leads to a field ridge, and if you keep walking, there is another "old shop."

When guests arrive, the waiter (server) greets them with a smile. The food here is very simple, only fried wontons, shrimp fried noodles, wonton noodles, and chop suey. But just these few styles are enough to satisfy people. In hot weather, because there are many people resting in Hong Kong, their business is most prosperous. Sometimes, when the guests are happy, the tables and chairs can also be placed outside, even on the field ridges. Although it is not very cold in winter, the wind is not conducive to business, so they call this time "slack season."

Sometimes, some nosy guests will ask them about the forced relocation (Note), and they are very optimistic——

"We have been fighting this lawsuit for several years, they dare not do anything. We are united, are we afraid of them?"

Kowloon City, this is a primitive, simple, paradise-like countryside!

(Note) Royal—a name like this is most prestigious in this bird port. Some higher-class Chinese people, I don't know if there is so-called "repression" at work, always disdainfully say that everything dirty and immoral is "Chinese flavor."

(Note) Kowloon City, if we have been reading newspapers recently, I believe this name is definitely not unfamiliar. The rulers of the Kowloon Peninsula are ambitiously trying to deceive and expel the villagers in the surrounding area.

### Runaway Coolies

— Especially

——Miscellaneous Mountain Travels

To have coolies run away halfway is a particularly unlucky thing, and in the coolie trade, there is some taboo about this.

Eating lunch... no, one can’t say it like that. The so-called “lunch” is actually long past the time. Originally, on mountain roads, eating cannot adhere to a fixed schedule. "Rushing to the tip and landing at an inn," one can feed one’s belly anywhere, as long as one is hungry. It means to open up your stomach as much as possible and stuff it! Passing by everything that can make you bloated to death, yet the cost is unexpectedly cheap.

It was time to get up again, and there was another flurry of activity. According to the rules, whatever someone carried or shouldered, once it was assigned, there would rarely be changes except in cases of necessity. The coolies did not need to be assigned partners each time. Thus, when about to depart, they would search for their partners without needing to be urged. However, today was a bit unusual. Partners shouldered their goods, one load after another, and walked away. In the end, four loads were left and no one could lift them. They searched around, and then shouted from the beginning to the end of the street, but where was any trace of them?

Young Zhang, the foreman, shouted himself hoarse and walked back angrily, veins appearing bloodshot in his eyes, the blood vessels on his forehead throbbing, muttering to himself: "Four ran away, those sons of turtles!" Looking back, the four remaining partners still stood there blankly. Time was passing, and of course they couldn’t stay there for long. The first group had already started climbing the mountainside in front, winding along slowly like ants.

No matter how one looked at it, the old coolie leader could no longer bear the heavy burden of shoulder carrying. What about the two coolie leaders, Zhang and Li? They tacitly assumed the roles of two missing coolies, but there were still two short, so it was necessary to find others.

After leaving Zhengzhi Street, coolie Zhang was still muttering: "Good, you sons of turtles, making me suffer to death. If I run into you, I'll beat you to a pulp!" Walking on the rugged road, his anger still hadn't completely dissipated. At the same time, because he was bearing the responsibility of leading the way, if there was a pool of water on the side of the mountain, or a branch on the side of the road, he had to shout like the other coolies!

——A sea of water ahead!——

——Green reeds on the left!…

Following, the partners in the rear would respond—

——Open the mirror to take a photo!

——Lift the pole over the big peak!…

Today, the signs of rain didn't seem to lessen. The mountains that looked not far away, like “seeing a mountain and thinking you can run to it,” were tightly covered by dark clouds. The mountain haze and dark clouds gradually merged together, and the valley in the encirclement was even darker. The water in the stream was particularly rapid these past few days. Usually, after several impacts and filtrations, it was so clear that one could see the fish swimming at the bottom, but now, it was so murky yellow that one couldn't see anything at all. The reason was said to be due to flash floods in the mountains ahead.

According to the usual practice of traveling, when passing Huangyazi, one should actually make another quick stop, nibbling on a couple of ears of fresh corn that just came out of the pot, but the weather was indeed too bad. The fine rain was already falling diagonally. Dropping by the inn and rushing on the road, this thought hung in their hearts. They raised the oilcloth and hurried on the distant journey. Ahead, the clouds pressing down on the mountain peaks were even lower.

When they reached the "Tea Pavilion" at the top of the mountain, the rain was heavy. The quilts in the sedan chairs were already half-wet. After calculating, there were still about ten *li* to the next inn. It looked like the weather would hinder their progress. After discussing, they decided to temporarily stay overnight at the Tea Pavilion. Speaking of the Tea Pavilion, it was really not a place for lodging. There were only six or seven rooms for mountain product businesses in total. In the tea pavilion on the left, there was a large tea vat, with three or four chipped cups hanging outside. Because the distance between the two stops was relatively far, and this was also a passageway up the mountain, “going up the mountain” always made people thirsty in hot weather. Thus, the Tea Pavilion compensated for this need.

After repeatedly negotiating with the homeowner, they finally agreed, leaving some empty spaces in each room for us. Sitting on long wooden benches under the grass shed, we inquired about the local customs here. Suddenly, a burst of shouts rose from the room, so violent, stern, and mixed with the sound of punches. We were shocked and rushed in hastily. Ah! What could we say? Two runaway coolies were comfortably lying in bed smoking, and Zhang, the coolie leader who had been grumbling all the way, grabbed them and started beating them without saying a word. The old coolie leader was cursing, and many people were shouting. Later, the result of the mediation was that the two of them would still return to the group, and when it was time to eat at the county town, they would treat the coolie leaders to several *liang* of yellow wine as compensation. That was how the matter was resolved.

Unable to sleep at night, I listened quietly to the sound of the mountain streams and the crisp sound of rain hitting the thatched shed.

### A Novel School for Difficult Children in England

— Special

In the town of East Sutton, England, there is an old 17th-century mansion where a young psychologist, Mr. Shao, has established a special school. It is exclusively dedicated to a kind of psychological education experiment for stubborn and difficult children. The entire school only has over twenty students. The youngest is only five years old, and the oldest is seventeen years old. Half of them were sent there because their parents and teachers believed that they were impossible to discipline, because these children vehemently opposed ordinary rules. The other half had also been taught at various psychological guidance centers but their bad habits could not be corrected. Only then were they sent to Mr. Shao for guidance. They all suffer from various neurological disorders, including a few who suffer from kleptomania.

Mr. Shao ordered the students to establish a "Police Court" and to formulate their own laws and enforce them themselves. The authority of the school staff is not greater than that of the students. The student chairman of the court can also sue and punish the staff. The staff cannot impose corporal punishment on the students, but in the event of extremely serious incidents, they can also use force against the students. When the court opens a case, after the witnesses have finished their testimony, the students listening to the trial raise their hands to decide whether the defendant is guilty. If the defendant does not comply with the court's judgment, he can be sued again, but the second punishment will be more severe than the first, and he can also be deprived of his rights. The greatest punishment is not to allow him to participate in any social life in the school. Those who have committed offenses may be ordered to compensate for the loss, which is deducted from their pocket money. If a large amount of money is stolen, after a thorough investigation, the offender's personal belongings may be auctioned off to compensate, or he may be fined to work on campus, paid at a rate of two pence per hour. A local farmer once came to the school to complain that several children were chasing his sheep for fun. As a result, the weekly meeting of students and staff passed a law prohibiting scaring sheep. One child violated this law, and the court fined him one penny. One student put nearly a hundred small fish in a glass bottle, and many died from overcrowding. After another student reported it, a law was passed requiring students to obtain a license for raising fish or other pets, with a license fee of half a penny each. Their every move is restricted by the group. For example, if a student wants to ride a bicycle, he must first be tested in driving on the road in front of two students. Only after passing the test will he be issued a license to ride a bicycle outside.

Mr. Shao initially allowed students to not attend classes at school if they did not want to. They could get up whenever they wanted and go out whenever they wanted. But after Mr. Shao's guidance, they surprisingly did not want to enjoy this excessive freedom. They are now able to abide by the new system and develop according to routine. According to Mr. Shao, these students have the hope of becoming good citizens in the future.

### Grand Theater Screens "The Great Detective Donner"

New Work by Superstar William Powell

Starting today, the Grand Theater will screen Warner Brothers' glamorous detective blockbuster "The Great Detective Donner" (Private Detective 62). The film stars the great William Powell and features the beautiful actress Margaret Lindsay. The film tells the story of an international detective who retires to become a private detective and is ordered by the private detective agency to investigate the secrets of a romantic girl. As a result, he falls in love with the girl and discovers that the detective agency he serves is actually a secret organization of villains. The plot is full of twists and turns and is very interesting. William Powell plays the great detective Donner in the film and his acting skills are excellent, adding a lot of color to the film.

### Behind-the-Scenes at Lianhua Studio

In "A Match Made in Heaven," Lan Gen has the most shots, with a total of 500 shots in the whole play, while Han Zhan has more than 350.

In "A Pearl Lost in the Sea of People," materials from a guide agency are needed. Director Zhu Shilin and actress Li Lili are both laymen in this field. They once asked the experienced veterans of the main factory and benefited a lot.

The cinematographer of "Spring Comes to the World" is Huang Shaofen. His artistry is originally good, especially when he is filming Yan Yan, which makes him even more excited, so he makes Yan Yan even more beautiful.

When Yin Xiucen has nothing to do, he often likes to go to the recording room to eavesdrop on the work of the studio. It is said that he only hears the sound but does not see the person, like listening to ventriloquism, and its wonder cannot be described in words.

Han Lan'gen looks as thin as a salamander, but his appetite is double that of others. Sometimes he can eat eight bowls in one meal—believe it or not.

Hong Jingling used to play roles like counselors and doctors, so he has the nickname of a standard counselor.

### Lan Ping as Kadlina in "The Thunderstorm"

### Cathay Screens "Spring on a Yacht"

A light and fluent romantic comedy

The wide-mouthed, funny actress Martha Raye and the petite, exquisite actress Shirley Ross are both the protagonists of "Kaleidoscope." They also co-starred in a romantic, funny singing blockbuster "Spring on a Yacht" (Hideaway Girl), which opens today at the Cathay Grand Theatre. The film tells the story of a young girl who, because she is forced to marry a boor, is unwilling and tries to escape at the wedding. At that time, another woman steals the boor's precious jewels, but everyone suspects that the girl stole them. So they report to the police to investigate. In order to avoid attracting attention, the girl temporarily pretends to be someone else's bride and hides on a yacht, and all kinds of unexpected things happen constantly. The film is not only full of laughs but also has many opera scenes.

### Minxin News

After "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit" was accompanied by music, it was largely pre-screened in theaters. The excellence of the results and the touching emotions made the viewers present praise it incessantly. This kind of realistic story can happen in any Chinese family, and it can be so tense, tragic, intense, and moving, which is something that no other film has ever achieved.

"New Humanity" is currently shooting a scene in Zhao Jiaxiang's residence. Hu Rong has taken off his Western suit and leather shoes and put on cloth shoes and a long robe, and he also has a round-topped hat on his head.

"Mysterious Female Detective," directed by Ren Pengnian and starring Wu Lizhu, is in preparation for filming.

Jin Qingyu is now focusing on revising the script of "Fratricide" so that he can focus on directing work during production and avoid the trouble of having to take care of everything.

Tian Han once sent Minxin a new script called "The Blacksmith Shop"

A total of twenty or thirty people participated in the music accompaniment work for "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit." Every time they worked until late at night, they would eat Cantonese pot noodles for supper, which was very interesting.

Recently, in addition to Lin Chuchu, Hu Rong, Wang Guilin, Xu Kunwu, and Chen Renzhi acting in "New Humanity," Li Kengdi's younger brother Li Xi has also been on camera. His cleverness is just like Li Keng in the silent "Humanity" of that year.

### Chen Yumei Stars in Taiping Flower

The famous novelist Zhang Henshui has many works. "The Story of Laughter and Tears" and "Happy Enemies" have been adapted for the screen successively. Now, his famous book "Taiping Flower" will also be made into a film by Tianyi Company.

"Taiping Flower" is named Taiping, but it is actually not peaceful, just like the movie "All Quiet on the Western Front" says it is quiet, but in fact, there is a big war going on. Therefore, "Taiping Flower" is a great work reflecting the current era.

Under Tianyi's active preparation, "Taiping Flower" will be filmed soon, starring Chen Yumei, and jointly directed by Shao Zuiweng, Wen Yimin, and Zuo Ming. This is undoubtedly a blockbuster film that will cause a sensation in the film industry.
