### Enemy Intensifies Attacks on Liuhang and Luodian Line, Our Troops Withdraw Westward to Defend New Positions

Our left and right wings maintain close contact.  Days of bloody battle result in 2,000-3,000 enemy casualties.  Our troops in Jiangwan advance towards the enemy via Qimei Road.  Fierce fighting in Zhabei yesterday, enemy suffers heavy losses all day.

Since the enemy's fourth general offensive began, they have been fiercely attacking our lines for days. The intensity of the fighting is unprecedented since the start of the Shanghai battle. The left flank of our positions from Luodian to Liuhang and Gujiazhai has been the target of concentrated enemy air and ground fire. Our troops have been holding their positions firmly, responding calmly. In addition to artillery fire against enemy positions, we have engaged in hand-to-hand combat whenever enemy infantry advances, inflicting heavy casualties. Consequently, in recent days, various key strongholds have been contested fiercely, with the enemy suffering two to three thousand casualties under the bullets and bayonets of our loyal soldiers. Our reputation has struck fear into the enemy's heart. Starting from the first day, the enemy has concentrated artillery and aircraft fire on our positions, firing thousands of shells and conducting dozens of bombing raids each day, causing some damage to our left flank fortifications. For strategic reasons, after inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, our troops have orderly withdrawn from the Luodian-Liuhang line along the Hutai Highway to strongholds 1,000 meters west of the highway. As of the time of this report, the enemy has not dared to advance on Liuhang. Our new fortifications have already been strongly emplaced, allowing for flexible offense and defense, and maintaining close contact with our right flank positions in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Miaohang, with no impact on the right flank battles. Currently, our right-wing troops are facing the enemy across the Yunzaobang River. However, we still have strong forces holding the area around Chongmingtangzhai and Dongqiangzhai on both sides of the Hutai Highway on the north bank of the Yunzaobang, preventing the enemy from advancing. Yesterday morning at 1:00 AM, the enemy shifted forces attacking Liuhang and Gujiazhai and launched an offensive there. After a brave and fierce battle by our troops, the enemy was routed in about an hour. At around 8:00 AM, the enemy launched another attack with heavy forces. The sounds of cannons and machine guns shook the surrounding areas. Our troops fought with redoubled courage, advancing without retreating, and after two hours of fierce fighting, they finally repelled the enemy. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle. Our troops continue to hold their positions there, persisting against the enemy. The enemy troops along the north bank of the Yunzaobang are currently entrenched in places like Zhouzhai, Dongtangjiazhai, Huzhai, and Dongyangzhai, confronting our troops south of the bank. In the morning, both sides fought fiercely with artillery and machine guns, with our troops holding a clear advantage. The enemy's attempt to cross the river and invade the south bank is destined to fail.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 10:00 PM on the third that our troops in Jiangwan are still taking the offensive. After the enemy troops south of Sanmin Road, north of Qimei Road, and west of Songhu Road withdrew towards the city center, we immediately searched and advanced. At 3:00 AM today, we used a portion of our forces with superior weaponry to cross Qimei Road and attack the enemy, charging through enemy lines for about an hour before returning to our original defenses. After daybreak, enemy aircraft came to assist in the battle, dropping multiple bombs and concentrating artillery fire to bombard us. We also returned fire, and the mutual bombardment continued for a long time. Furthermore, the enemy still occupies the area around Lujiajiao north of Xiangyin Road, currently building fortifications in front of and behind Tongde School, apparently intending to hold out stubbornly.

Our newspaper's correspondent obtained the following news from the front: (1) Yesterday, the enemy launched an attack near Gujiazhai, and was met with machine-gun fire from one of our units, resulting in over two hundred enemy casualties. (2) The enemy breached a section of the Yinjiajiao line near Liuhang yesterday, but our fresh troops immediately arrived and launched a determined counterattack. As a result, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated, and our lines were restored to their original state. (3) The enemy at Beitianlu Temple and Tongde Medical College has completely withdrawn, but the enemy at Lingnan School shows no sign of retreat. (4) On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 2nd) at around 9:00 AM, our troops shot down an enemy aircraft from our positions. At around 6:00 PM, another enemy aircraft was hit near Gujiazhai and immediately caught fire and was destroyed. (5) The enemy troops that withdrew from the area west of the city center were transferred to the area south of Liuhang, from Gujiazhai to the Yunzaobang area, to reinforce their forces. The enemy had repeatedly failed to attack Jiangwanzhen and Chizhi University, and has changed its strategy, shifting its focus to the aforementioned areas. (6) According to intelligence, enemy Major General Masaki Jinzaburo of the young officer faction will reportedly arrive in Shanghai within the week, but his mission is unclear.

### Fierce Fighting in Zhabei All Day Yesterday

Catholic Church and other positions lost and regained.  Enemy casualties exceed 1,000, finally unable to withstand and retreat.

In the Zhabei sector, the enemy launched a fierce attack on Bazilu [Targets Road] the day before yesterday, but after being dealt a heavy blow by us, they were forced to retreat. The day before yesterday reinforcements were called in from Jiangwan. From daybreak, enemy artillery incessantly shelled that sector. Shells rained down like rain, and several enemy planes circled overhead, dropping many bombs. Our troops calmly responded, steadfastly defending their positions, without budging. Around 8 AM, a large detachment of enemy infantry, under the cover of tanks, launched a fierce attack on our positions from Zhongxing Road and Baoshan Road. Our troops immediately engaged them. By about 10 AM, the enemy retreated slightly because of extremely heavy casualties. However, after half an hour, they again reinforced their troops and continued their attack. The two sides engaged in close-quarters combat for more than an hour, the ferocity of the fighting unprecedented. By the afternoon, due to slight casualties on our side and a significant disparity in numbers, we moved to a pre-arranged position in order to preserve our strength. The enemy then occupied the Qixiu Girls' School and the Catholic Church. Simultaneously, although the enemy used all its air, ground, and artillery power to fiercely attack us at one point, their casualties reached seven to eight hundred, far exceeding our own. Therefore, by about 4 PM, they were already showing signs of collapse. In the evening, after reorganizing, our troops launched a vigorous counterattack and organized suicide squads, each carrying several hand grenades, rushing into the enemy lines and throwing them unexpectedly. The enemy, caught off guard, suffered countless losses as we killed and captured many. The enemy retreated in disarray, and our troops immediately regained their original positions. Because movement at night was inconvenient, we did not pursue. In summary, enemy casualties yesterday totaled around a thousand, while our casualties were only over a hundred, nearly ten times fewer than theirs. The heroism of our troops in resisting the enemy, and the strength of our positions, can be seen from this. Yesterday morning, enemy artillery continued to fire incessantly, and planes were dispatched continuously. It is expected that there will be more fierce fighting today.

Furthermore, according to two reports from a Central News Agency war correspondent at 10 PM and 12 AM last night on the battle situation: At 2 AM yesterday, the enemy army, led by tanks, launched a fierce attack from Guangdong Street, firing small artillery and machine guns indiscriminately at us. Our troops calmly responded, fought bitterly for a long time, and ultimately, due to damage to our fortifications, were briefly overrun by the enemy. Our troops fought and retreated, preventing the enemy from penetrating deeper. Subsequently, we received reinforcements of fresh troops, and our morale was boosted. We cooperated in a counterattack, intercepting and killing the enemy in a bloody battle, driving them back and restoring our original position. By this time, day had already broken, and enemy planes took off to bomb and shell us fiercely with artillery, aiming to destroy our fortifications. Around 9 AM, enemy infantry continued to advance towards Baoshan Road, Guangdong Street, and Dongbao Road, but after our counterattack, they ultimately failed. The two sides remained in a stalemate, and enemy artillery continued to shell us fiercely. At 2 PM in the afternoon, the enemy again attacked Baoshan Road, Zhongxing Road, and Dongbaoxing Road. Seeing that our fortifications were slightly damaged, the enemy charged fiercely. We divided our troops to the left and right, ambushing them in hidden places. After a portion of the enemy had charged past, the ambush troops rose up, cutting them off. The leading troops, about forty men, were immediately surrounded by our forces. Enemy tanks urgently fired artillery to provide cover for their retreat, but after our fierce counterattack, the enemy tanks were nearly destroyed by our bombardment and retreated in panic. The surrounded portion was trapped in the core and completely annihilated by our dense gunfire. Around 4 PM, enemy planes and artillery again launched a joint bombardment, which continued until evening. At about 7 PM, the enemy, with two to three hundred men, attacked Qiujiang Road, Dongbaoxing Road, and other places in several groups. We met them head-on, and the sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. After about two hours of stalemate, the enemy, seeing that we were heavily guarded and there was no opportunity to exploit, retreated towards North Sichuan Road at 9 PM. At the time of the report, the enemy was still stationed there, not yet gone. If they have other intentions, according to observations, there will be more intense fighting on the morning of the 4th.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 10:30 AM on the third that several enemy planes were active in the airspace over Zhabei since early morning, while the enemy naval landing forces entrenched in Hongkou were very busy, gathering in large detachments in the North Sichuan Road area, apparently intending to launch a major attack on our North Station area. Our Zhabei defenses are extremely strong. If the enemy attacks, they will definitely not succeed. Our troops have also been placed on high alert, prepared to kill the enemy.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 5:20 PM on the third that about two enemy divisions, comprising the fourth batch of reinforcements, had mostly arrived on the first of this month and were stationed in the Yangshupu area. Our troops expect that the enemy will launch a large-scale attack on our Zhabei front line, so we have strengthened our defenses and are waiting in full battle array. This morning, a large detachment of enemy troops gathered on North Sichuan Road, and then several enemy planes circled in the airspace over our positions, covering their troops, and launched a fierce attack on our North Station and Baoshan Road area. Although the enemy relied on tanks, they did not make any progress after being intercepted by our powerful weapons. As of the time of the report, the fierce fighting was still ongoing.

Since early yesterday morning, the enemy has been continuously shelling our Zhabei area with heavy artillery. The explosive power is enormous, indicating that the caliber of their artillery is very large. However, our troops have also frequently returned fire with heavy artillery. From morning to night, the booming sound has been continuous.

### Fierce Fighting Occurred Yesterday in the Suburbs of Gujiazhai and Shenjiazhai

Enemy attempts to cross the Yunzaobang River have been thwarted by our brave resistance.

In the Liuhang area, the fighting has shifted southward. Yesterday, fierce fighting occurred in the suburbs of Gujiazhai and Shenjiazhai villages. Enemy attempts to cross the Yunzaobang River have been thwarted by our brave interception. We are intensifying our vigilance to prevent the enemy from attacking again.

The Central News Agency reports, our agency's war correspondent reported at 10:30 AM on the third that the enemy is fiercely attacking our Luodian-Liuhang line in an attempt to cut off our Hutai Highway. The intensity of the artillery fire is unprecedented. The enemy is also using a large number of tanks, continuously attacking, causing some damage to our defensive fortifications. Our troops are fighting with flesh and blood, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, and are currently holding Liuhang and defending the Shenjiawan and Linjiazhai line, confronting the enemy in a strict array. If the enemy attacks, they will be met with a head-on blow. It is expected that future fighting will focus on the right of Liuhang, all the way to the Yunzaobang River line. We have secretly strengthened our defenses.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 10:30 AM on the third that the enemy troops entrenched on the north bank of the Yunzaobang River in places like Huzhai and Zhouzhai launched an attack on our bridgehead this morning, but were forced to retreat after being met with a fierce counterattack.

### Fierce Artillery Battles Erupted Twice in Pudong Yesterday

We are on high alert, and the enemy's attempt to land has failed.  Enemy planes drop incendiary bombs, destroying several thatched houses.

At dawn yesterday, our artillery positions in Pudong suddenly unleashed a fierce barrage on enemy bases in the Yangshupu area. After being hit, the enemy fired back from enemy warships in the Huangpu River, and the mutual bombardment lasted about an hour before stopping. Towards dusk, another fierce artillery battle erupted in the Huangpu River. First, around 6:00 PM, two enemy planes circled and scouted several times over the areas of Lanni Ferry, Lujia Ferry, and Lujiazui in Pudong. One of them dropped a red signal and strafed downwards with machine guns, while the other dropped several incendiary bombs, hitting civilian houses in the area. The houses immediately caught fire, and black smoke filled the air, and the flames soared into the sky. Enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River continuously fired at the area where the fire started, and enemy boats also moved restlessly along the Pudong bank of the river. The atmosphere in the Huangpu River suddenly became tense. Our Pudong troops were on high alert at all the docks along the river. The enemy boats seemed to see that our side was heavily guarded, so they did not attempt to land. Our side also returned fire with several shots at the enemy warships, and by about 6:30 PM, the sound of artillery had subsided, but the fire did not extinguish until about 9:00 PM at night.

Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, the enemy again used two motorboats carrying twenty to thirty marines to patrol the Chunjiang Wharf area, attempting to attack Pudong, assisted by two aircraft bombing the Pudong area. For a time, the sound of artillery roared, lasting for half an hour. But ultimately, because our troops responded calmly, the enemy did not succeed and fled immediately, and the sound of artillery and airplanes stopped.

### Our Air Force Night Raid Achieves Success Again

Reliable sources report that the night before last (the 2nd), our air force carried out a night raid on Shanghai, dropping several bombs on enemy positions in the Yangshupu area. Two of them landed in the Gongda Yarn Factory, with a loud explosion that reverberated far and wide. As for the fourth night raid by our planes the night before last (the 1st), one bomb landed in the Dakang Yarn Factory, causing significant damage to the enemy.

Last night and this morning, several of our reconnaissance planes came to Shanghai to scout enemy positions and movements in the Yangshupu and Dinghai Island areas. Although the enemy fired intense anti-aircraft artillery, our flying generals calmly maneuvered through the gunfire, and after completing their mission, safely returned to base.

### Enemy Casualties Reach Over 30,000

According to the military headquarters' announcement, since August 13th, the number of enemy casualties is estimated to be over 30,000, with about 16,000 killed in action, about 12,000 wounded, of whom about 2,400 died en route to their home country. Cholera has also been discovered in the enemy army, spreading rapidly, and about 200 have died from the disease.

### Large Numbers of Enemy Corpses Loaded for Return Home

Since the enemy began its fourth general offensive on the 28th of last month, it has met with determined resistance from our troops and suffered very heavy casualties. In addition to one enemy Red Cross ship having already sailed to Shanghai on the first of the month, carrying away more than 800 wounded and dead enemy soldiers, another large enemy Red Cross ship arrived at 3:15 PM yesterday, docking at the north wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. Subsequently, another batch of enemy corpses and wounded soldiers, about a thousand in number, were loaded for return to Japan.

### Additional 2,500 Enemy Troops Arrive

The enemy's fourth reinforcement force, consisting of one division and one brigade, totaling about 40,000 men, had all arrived in Shanghai by the 1st of this month. However, in order to launch a major offensive, the enemy decided to send another elite division to Shanghai. The first batch, consisting of about 2,000 cavalry, arrived yesterday. This morning (the 3rd) at around 6:00 AM, two enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, the Hakuba-san Maru No. 278 and the Shin-ko Maru No. 168, arrived, fully loaded with enemy troops, about 2,500 men, and sailed to Shanghai, docking separately at the Osaka and Huishan wharves, where they disembarked successively. The Shin-ko Maru No. 168 transport ship has a displacement of nearly 10,000 tons, and its size is unprecedented among enemy transport ships. When the ship came to Shanghai, all the upper and lower cabins were packed with enemy troops. At the same time, heavy artillery was unloaded. It is said that the majority of this second batch that arrived are enemy artillerymen.

### Enemy Artillery Bombards Shi Xianggong Temple

Our positions are strong, with no major losses. The enemy attacks several times, suffering heavy casualties.

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 3rd. Regarding Luodian, on the 2nd, the enemy used airplanes for reconnaissance, and shelled the area around Shi Xianggong Temple and Cao Wang Temple all day long, with over a thousand shells falling, but because our army's positions were solid, there were no major losses. At the same time, the 42nd regiment of their infantry, about a thousand men, also attacked our army's positions several times. Around dawn, the enemy also released smoke bombs to cover the advance of their infantry. After our army fired fiercely, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated without support. On the morning of the 3rd, the enemy attacked again, and fierce fighting is currently underway.

### Enemy Aircraft Rampage Everywhere Yesterday

Zhabei

At 9:00 AM yesterday, twelve enemy planes appeared over Zhabei, dropping over a dozen heavy bombs, attempting to destroy our defensive fortifications on the alert line, but the bombs dropped were aimless, so aside from destroying several civilian houses, there was no military loss at all. Until 11:00 AM, six enemy planes still lingered, constantly bombing. Three bombs fell near the Macgregor Road station, with no loss on our side.

Dachang

Yesterday morning, several enemy planes flew to the Dachang area to drop bombs, intending to destroy our defensive fortifications, but this area is densely populated with our anti-aircraft units, so the enemy planes, seeing our anti-aircraft fire, hurriedly flew away, causing the bombs they dropped to be even more aimless, so our side's losses were minimal.

Pudong

Yesterday morning, three enemy planes circled and scouted the area of Nanshi and Pudong at around 8:00 AM, occasionally strafing pedestrians with machine guns, and dropping four bombs near the Osaka Wharf warehouse across from Wangjia Wharf. It so happened that there were over twenty street urchins scavenging there, causing them to be affected. The enemy planes then flew north. At the same time, the enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River also fired several shots at Pudong, before quieting down.

Nanshi

At 7:00 AM yesterday, two enemy planes flew to the Nanshi area to reconnoiter, flying low when they reached the vicinity of Rihui Port and Tushanwan in Xujiahui, as high as the buildings, strafing downwards with machine guns, causing injuries to two civilians who could not avoid in time.

Western Shanghai

In the Caojiadu and Yujidun areas of western Shanghai, around 7:00 PM the night before last, several enemy planes flew to the area to drop bombs, destroying several civilian houses on the spot, and killing or wounding twelve or thirteen villagers. Upon hearing the news, the Seventh Rescue Team rushed to the scene and transported the injured to Shanghai for medical treatment.

At 5:01 PM the day before yesterday (the 2nd), an enemy plane circled and scouted over Tushanwan for over ten minutes, then opened fire downwards with machine guns over the Sacred Heart Hospital on the triangular area of Xietu Road, injuring a villager in the foot. At 6:30 AM yesterday morning, another enemy plane came again, constantly reconnoitering the area, causing great panic among the local Catholics. It is now known that the local church bishop was very surprised that the enemy plane suddenly shot at innocent Catholics, and so will send the collected bullet casings to the French Consulate to request that they negotiate with the enemy headquarters to stop it.

Kunshan

Transportation circles report that at 1:40 PM yesterday afternoon, eight enemy planes scouted for a long time near Jiaxing, dropping several bombs at the station, killing or wounding over twenty civilians. Although the tracks were damaged, they were repaired immediately, and traffic was not obstructed. The plane flew south, and was discovered over Kunshan at 7:30 PM, also dropping bombs, causing slight damage to the station building, but fortunately no one was injured. Also, at 4:30 PM, enemy planes were active and flew low in the Zhenru area, strafing our civilians with machine guns. Whether anyone was affected is still under investigation.

### Enemy Continues to Ship Munitions to Shanghai

In recent days, the enemy has been shipping large quantities of munitions, ammunition, and other military supplies. Those arriving today (the 3rd) included five enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships. The items loaded and their docking situation are as follows: (1) No. 154, the Hebei Maru, fully loaded with war horses, unloaded on land at the Huangpu Wharf. (2) No. 204, the Zhaotuan Maru, fully loaded with munitions, unloaded at the Osaka Wharf. (3) The Eleventh Liangyou Maru, fully loaded with oil and diesel, unloaded at the north wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. (4) The transport ship Shiretoko (no Chinese name), fully loaded with coal, unloaded at the middle wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. (5) At 9:30 AM this morning, another enemy transport ship, whose name is unknown, sailed to the north wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, and unloaded a large batch of munitions. The No. 91 transport ship Haguro Maru, which sailed to Shanghai yesterday, is still docked at the Huangpu Wharf, continuing to unload munitions. Yesterday morning, the No. 260, No. 324, No. 282, and No. 158 ships, which transported enemy reinforcements to Shanghai, and the No. 72, No. 104, and No. 115 ships, which transported munitions to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, had all sailed out of the Songkou and returned to Japan before dawn today.

### Enemy Air Force Suffers Heavy Losses

Command aircraft has been destroyed by our side. Many elite combat personnel have died.

An enemy plane was active in the airspace over our army positions in Dachang the day before yesterday, and one was hit by our anti-aircraft guns, and its fuel tank immediately caught fire, exploded, and fell into our army's positions. Both pilots were killed. According to the enemy's announcement, they were Petty Officer 3rd Class Tatsuo Shinohara and Seaman 1st Class Misaburo Takarai. Also, the aircraft that was shot down by us in Shimonoseki when it raided Nanjing on the 25th of last month was their command aircraft, piloted by Squadron Leader Lieutenant Colonel Sakamoto and Aviation Petty Officer 1st Class Wakita. Both men were known as elite combat personnel of the enemy air force and enjoyed a strong reputation. Sakamoto was ordered to come to Shanghai to participate in the war, but it was less than half a month before he was killed by our anti-aircraft forces when he again attacked our capital on the 22nd and 23rd of last month. Also, Major Masamoto, who was killed in Zhabei on the 29th of last month, was a classmate of Sakamoto and was also known for his fighting ability. The heavy losses of the enemy air force are evident.

### Concession Health Bureau Clears Decaying Corpses in the Hongkou Area

Enemy troops inhumanely massacre our innocent children.

The area from Broadway Road to the end of Yangshupu Road in the Hongkou District, as well as the areas of Zhaofeng Road, Tilanqiao, and Zhoushan Road, has seen the expansion of fighting to the areas mentioned above due to the occupation by Japanese troops. Dead bodies litter the road and can be seen everywhere. Roadside corpses have decayed after being exposed to the sun and dew for fifty days, resulting in the breeding of epidemics in the Hongkou District, which was nearly spread throughout the city. Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department prevented it from happening by making every effort to put out the epidemic, which made it possible for the epidemic to be contained. However, the corpses in the Hongkou District and the rotten food still had to be removed in order to prevent future epidemics. Therefore, the Concession Health Bureau found a way to completely remove the corpses from the roads using chemical methods. As of yesterday, some of the work has been completed. But the scope is too wide, so the work is very difficult. The workers work in the war zone every day, disregarding danger, and are to be commended for their spirit. It is known that the corpses consist of soldiers from both sides. In addition, most were poor Chinese people who were unable to escape, resulting in them suffering from the enemy. However, there were also many victims of stray bullets. However, the most tragic victims were the children massacred by the enemy troops. It is reported that five boys and girls, who seemed to be siblings, were killed by enemy troops in a certain house near Tilanqiao, and their parents are nowhere to be found. The enemy troops' inhumane nature can be seen from this.

### The Enemy Has Attacked the Area Around the Municipal Cemetery Several Times, But Has Been Repelled By Our Troops

Our Miaohang positions remain unmoved.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 10:30 AM on the third that after the enemy troops retreated eastwards from the Jiangwan area, a large detachment of infantry has now gathered in the area of the Municipal Cemetery and Lingnan School on Zhongshan North Road. Since the night before last, they have begun to attack our positions in the Yinjiazhai and Zhangjiazhai area, coming on with great force. Our troops used machine guns and rifles to fire densely, preventing the enemy from advancing and forcing them to retreat to their original positions. Afterwards, they attacked several times, but our troops fought bravely and repelled them. Our troops also did not pursue and firmly defended our original positions. Since 3:00 AM yesterday (the 3rd), the enemy has been shelling our Miaohang area, continuously firing dozens of shells, but they were all aimless, and our fortifications remained unmoved, with no other losses. By daybreak, the sound of artillery gradually subsided.

### The Economic Foundations of China and Japan and the Prospect of the War of Resistance

— Zhou Xianwen

The sound of cannons in Shanghai on "August 13th" clearly demonstrated China's attitude towards resistance. Currently, the issue of concern for people throughout the nation is merely the prospect of the War of Resistance. Regarding the future of the War of Resistance, what we must first sternly criticize is the absurd estimation of a small number of "weapon-only theorists." They only see that the enemy's planes are more numerous than ours, and the enemy's cannons are more fierce than ours. They then, intentionally or unintentionally, worry about the future of the War of Resistance. Of course, we do not deny the importance of weapons in warfare, but anyone with a bit of "modern knowledge" must know that today's war is definitely not just a competition of weapons, but a duel of the entire manpower and material resources of the belligerent nations. Regarding manpower, this belongs to the issue of mass organization, which will be discussed in another article. Regarding material resources, this belongs to the issue of economic mobilization, which will now be briefly mentioned.

If we want to judge the prospect of this War of Resistance based on the material resources of China and Japan, that is, economic mobilization, the most crucial method is naturally to investigate the economic foundations of China and Japan. Since machinery gained an advantage over manpower in production tools, handicrafts have gradually declined, and the agricultural economy has also deteriorated day by day. What has risen in their place is the newly emerging machine industry. And this newly emerging machine industry must gradually shift from light industry to heavy industry. This is the destiny predetermined by historical development, and it cannot be reversed by human power. Therefore, in the past five or six years, this reporter has repeatedly written articles explaining the arrogance of those revivalists who insist that China must still be established on agriculture, that is, that agriculture should remain its economic foundation. They are either "blinded" and cannot see the general trend of historical development, or they are "ignoring their conscience" and intentionally catering to the "China agriculture, Japan industry" theory of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation promoted by Japanese imperialist scholars. Although this reporter also acknowledges the importance of agriculture, I have always believed that if China does not want to be a vassal of other countries today, our economic foundation must be rebuilt on industry. We should "catch up head-on" with heavy industry and "save" China "from the root." These revivalists may not fully understand this principle, but the clever and malicious Japanese imperialist scholars are as clear as day. After their promotion of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation failed, they used "lightning speed" to give China a serious blow, preventing China from ever recovering. This is the economic explanation for why Japan launched this war.

Now, Japanese imperialism no longer allows us to calmly rebuild our economic foundation. During this period of the War of Resistance, we must still do our best to build heavy industry and try to change our economic foundation. However, we should frankly admit that Japan's economic foundation has already been built on industry, while China's economic foundation cannot break away from agriculture. From the perspective of economic development, we are indeed "one step behind." In other words, since the Opium War, under the dual oppression and exploitation of imperialism and feudal remnants, our machine industry has gradually risen, and our agricultural economy has gradually declined, but our national economy is still based on agriculture. Regarding Japan, although Japan is a late-developing capitalist country, and although many industrial raw materials are not available within Japan, Japan has after all embarked on the road of industry. However, precisely because Japan is a late-developing capitalist country, and because many industrial raw materials are not available within its country, Japan's economy is still stuck in the stage of light industry.

Since the economic foundations of China and Japan are as described above, then from an economic perspective, what is the prospect of China's War of Resistance?

Because Japan has long formed a capitalist country, and Japan's economic foundation is no longer in agriculture but in industry, according to the characteristics of capitalism, Japan will naturally benefit from a "quick decision" in this war. They quickly mobilize their machine industry on one hand and quickly raise huge amounts of war funds through advanced financial institutions on the other hand. They dream of "making China surrender in one fell swoop." As for China, because its economic foundation is not in industry but in agriculture, according to the characteristics of the agricultural economy, China will naturally benefit from "protracted resistance" in this war. Currently, our machine industry cannot talk about mobilizing for war and is busy retreating to safe areas instead. The five hundred million yuan of national salvation bonds, after being raised for more than a month, has not yet reached half of the amount. All of this is a natural phenomenon under an agricultural economic foundation and is not at all cause for pessimism. Moreover, Japan is still a late-developing capitalist country, its heavy industry is not very developed, its light industrial products must seek markets overseas, and many of its industrial raw materials must rely on imports. Therefore, as long as we can persist, after a considerable period, Japan will inevitably find it difficult to continue. The prospect of the War of Resistance is very optimistic. Of course, here we must also frankly admit that because our economic foundation is in agriculture, we can be more economically sustainable in comparison. However, because our heavy industry is not as good as Japan's, our need for ordnance and ammunition relies on overseas suppliers, even more so than Japan. However, since we have already pointed out the absurdity of "weapon-only theory," coupled with international public opinion sympathizing with us, as long as we work hard, there should be no problem with the supply of overseas ordnance and ammunition. Because of this, as long as we are determined to persist, and do not hesitate to sacrifice, final victory will surely be ours. Even more because of this, we should of course not be arrogant in victory or discouraged in defeat. Regarding the initial military setbacks on the front lines of the War of Resistance, we must consider them to be expected (in terms of strategy, we must adopt guerrilla tactics at a certain period) and be determined to fight repeatedly after each defeat. For the sake of national survival, we should do so. For the sake of personal careers, we should also do so. That is to say, during this period of the War of Resistance, even for the sake of our personal careers, we must be prepared to persist. Some people now hope that the war will end quickly, or fear that the war will be prolonged. Regardless of whether their motives are pure, the reason is that they do not understand the differences in the economic foundations of China and Japan. The result is that it will have an extremely bad impact on the prospect of the War of Resistance. We must thoroughly eliminate this mentality.

Judging from the economic foundations of China and Japan, the prospect of the War of Resistance is as clear as day. We should have a thorough awakening, not be afraid of sacrifice, make persistent efforts, be determined to persevere, and use all of the nation's manpower and material resources to strive for final victory.

### Counter-offensive on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line: Enemy at Sangyuan Stubbornly Resists

### Han Fuqu Sternly Denounces the Japanese for Spreading Rumors and Provoking Discord

Issues a statement hoping that Chinese and foreigners will not fall for the enemy's tricks. The enemy on the Tianjin-Pukou front is concentrating all its forces to attack us fiercely.

Jinan Correspondence: Since our country launched a full-scale war of resistance, we have given the enemy a head-on blow. Recently, the enemy, exhausted and out of ideas, has resorted to its old trick of division and sowing discord, doing everything possible to provoke discord, in order to achieve its ambitious desires. However, our central and local authorities have already seen through the shameless tricks of the ugly enemy, and the people of the country, upon hearing of them, also dismiss them with a smile. According to the Reuters dispatch from Beiping on September 27, Japan sent Doihara by plane to Jinan to meet with Han Fuqu, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army and Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, to discuss the autonomy of five provinces, etc. No one believes this unfounded rumor, and the central and local authorities will never fall for their plot because of this. Han was extremely resentful upon hearing the news, fearing that friendly countries would not understand the truth, and issued a written statement on the 29th, hoping that the people of the country and foreigners would not fall for the enemy's tricks. The written statement is as follows: "Yesterday, foreign newspapers published reports that the Japanese Doihara came to Jinan and discussed the autonomy of five provinces, etc. This kind of unfounded rumor is really not worth a knowing person's smile. This time, our country's war of resistance is the only way for China to strive for survival. All of our soldiers have an unshirkable responsibility to protect the country and defend the people. I, who bears the important responsibility of military and political affairs, resist the enemy and defend against insults, and everything I do is in accordance with the orders of the Central Government and follows the guidance of the supreme military leader. Yet the enemy wants to use its trick of division and sowing discord at this time, provoking discord and confusing the ears and eyes, which is extremely hateful. I sincerely hope that the people of the country and friendly countries will not fall for the enemy's tricks and will not believe rumors, then the country will be fortunate." The enemy on the Tianjin-Pukou front has been concentrating all its forces to attack south in recent days. We have also concentrated reinforcements and are fighting desperately, so the fighting is extremely fierce. According to a telephone call from Dongguang, at about 11 p.m. on the 28th, a squadron of enemy soldiers was discovered thirty miles northeast of Dongguang, fiercely attacking our positions. At the same time, Huji, more than ten miles north of Nanxiakou, was also attacked by enemy soldiers. Our army divided its forces to meet them and fought fiercely, killing many enemies. A certain division commander of our army picked and compiled a dare-to-die team in Dongguang, and eight soldiers volunteered to participate. A certain division is in the process of reorganizing and preparing to launch a counter-offensive. Our steel armored car is patrolling the Nanxiakou area, but because the artillery fire is fierce, the north-south fork in the road at Nanxiakou Station has been destroyed by artillery fire. Our steel armored car has changed to defending Dongguang. As of the morning of the 29th, our troops had all concentrated at the predetermined locations. Our steel armored car is guarding the northeastern station outside the Beiyang flag. A section of the railway north of Dongguang Station has been dismantled. At 9:10 a.m. on the same morning, the sound of artillery fire was very loud to the east of Dongguang Station, and an enemy plane bombed and strafed the station. According to an investigation, it was because enemies had sneaked in from the right flank to attack our position. We discovered them and gave them a head-on blow, killing many enemies. However, the turnout north of Dongguang Station was again destroyed. At 11:45 a.m., the front-line battle was tense, and multiple teams of enemy plainclothes soldiers were detouring and causing chaos. We encircled and suppressed them separately, and they were mostly wiped out. A certain unit of our side is waiting for orders to advance north north of Lianzhen. At 2 p.m., an enemy heavy bomber arrived at Lianzhen Station to reconnoiter and strafe. Then, two more planes arrived, both bombers, and strafed the station. Our steel armored car suffered slight damage. At 4 p.m., an enemy plane arrived at Lianzhen Station, circling and bombing, dropping six or seven bombs. We suffered no losses.

Also at 7 a.m. on the same day, four enemy planes were discovered in Ju County. At 7:10 a.m., they flew southwest through Linyi. At 7:20 a.m., they passed Fei County. At 7:30 a.m., they arrived at Zou County. At 7:45 a.m., they arrived at Jining, dropping five bombs at the drill ground and one bomb at the railway station, injuring one of our workers. The enemy planes also flew low and strafed with machine guns. They left at 8:30 a.m. The four planes flew southeast through Zou County at 8:50 a.m.

### Songjiang

Enemy planes harass Songjiang for days

According to a person from Yulaimiao Township who came to Songjiang, at about 4 a.m. on the 27th, several enemy planes suddenly came and circled over the Huangpu River several times. There were two customs enforcement ships parked there. The enemy planes dropped two bombs, one ship was slightly damaged, and one bomb fell into the river and did not explode. At about 5 p.m. on the 29th, an enemy plane attacked and scouted the Puhui coast of Songjiang for about ten minutes before heading to the southeast corner. A quarter of an hour later, three more planes came and still circled the Pujiang Mizidu area to scout for about an hour before dropping three bombs and leaving.

### Ningbo

Execution of Twenty Traitors

Since the Shanghai battle, traitors in Ningbo and surrounding areas have taken the opportunity to operate, scout military affairs, secretly draw maps, and spread poison powder. The military and police agencies have rigorously investigated and arrested a large number of them. As of the 24th, those who have been interrogated, convicted, and sentenced to death by firing squad include Xia Dehou, Seng Kecheng, Seng Zhenghui, Seng Nengci, Li Pinwei, Ying Xiaolian, Zhao Xinliang, Li Afu, Ye Alin, Gu Ahua, Wang Aer, Gu Kangchun, Fang Jichang, Wang A’gen, Hua Xiaopin, Seng Nengxin, and others, totaling twenty people.

### Shaoxing

Execution of Traitor Lü Hongxiang

On the 29th, the District Command, acting on orders, executed the traitor Lü Hongxiang by firing squad at the large parade ground. The criminal colluded with Li Bixian, a worker at the Japanese Toyota Spinning Mill in Shanghai, who was also a traitor. Disguised as someone deciphering characters, he investigated household registration and transportation conditions in Xinchang Chengtan and other places, reporting to the enemy.

### Behind the Scenes: Important Figures in the Enemy's Naval and Air Forces in the Songhu Battle

Naval Leaders Lack Combat Experience; the "Four Heavenly Kings" of the Air Force Are Mostly Dead or Wounded

Tokyo Dispatch: Regarding the Japanese Navy that initiated the battle in Shanghai, the outside world only knows Hasegawa and Okawachi as the key figures. In reality, there are three or four other important roles. Hasegawa Kiyoshi is a vice admiral who once served as the Vice Minister of the Navy. He has the appearance of a rural schoolteacher. The Japanese government, considering his political acumen, specially appointed him as the commander-in-chief in Shanghai, where international relations are complex. However, his announcement to foreign embassies about the bombing of Nanjing only resulted in fierce international repercussions. His chief of staff, Sugiyama Rokuzo, is a rear admiral. A large number of "thousand-stitch belts" sent by the National Patriotic Women's Association were distributed to the front-line soldiers by Sugiyama, but he himself did not use them, knowing it was an unconscious act, he cunningly used it to win over military hearts. The fleet adjutant, Lieutenant Commander Fujino Hiroshi, is fluent in English, French, and German. Among the Japanese who are not proficient in foreign languages, he can certainly show off his abilities in Shanghai. Commander Okawachi once served as the captain of the battleships Yakumo and Iwate. This time, he returned to the country without being summoned, but made a statement to the government, saying that he advocated finding a way to end the Shanghai battle, otherwise, it would be quite unfavorable to the Japanese side. Okawachi's staff included Lieutenant Commander Fujita Risaburo, Lieutenant Commander Takeda Isamu, and Lieutenant Commander Yamauchi Eiichi. The adjutant was Captain Fukumi.

In the naval aviation corps, there are so-called Four Heavenly Kings, who are the most outstanding figures in the Japanese naval aviation corps, namely Major Wada (Tetsusaburo), Captain Takahashi (Kakuichi), Captain Shiroai (Sadayoshi), and Captain Yamashita (Shichiro). However, after bombing the Jinghu area, they were either killed, wounded, or captured. The Four Heavenly Kings have no longer appeared in the sky. Among these four, Wada was the team leader (according to recent reports, the Japanese flying team leader Captain Yamashita was captured, but in fact, Yamashita was not the team leader). The captured Yamashita has always had a reputation for acting without speaking. Now he silently surrendered, which is in line with his usual reputation.

### Feeling Ashamed for Weakness and Failure to Seek Treatment, Failing the Nation's Expectations

The war of resistance has begun. The military and the people are united. Everyone must be prepared for mobilization. There are many weak people in the rear. Evacuation is still a problem. How can they be loyal to the country? Yuanda Company is now located next to the Xinguang Grand Theater on Ningbo Road. Xinxiang Tongjie is twelve yuan per month. Beef sweat is four yuan per month.

### A Briton Writes to Correct the North China Daily News Editorial

Britain Should Not Be a Friend to Both Sides; It Should Fully Sympathize with China

The North China Daily News recently published an editorial opposing the implementation of economic sanctions against Japan and boycotting Japanese goods. Immediately, a Briton, signing as "Boycott," submitted a letter for correction, holding a fair view and indignant words. The translation is as follows: To the Editor of the North China Daily News, Newspaper reporters cannot please everyone. Some harsh letters addressed to you have clearly stated this. I do not want to condemn you for demeaning your noble profession by using your pen to write words of great error, etc. However, I am surprised that a certain foreign reporter in this port recorded the frivolous defense of the Japanese Consul General Okamoto in his monthly magazine, without uttering a word of condemnation for his lowly and unreasonable rejection of newspaper reporters. Is the reporter tacitly approving Okamoto's contempt for foreign reporters in this port? This is another matter. However, you have already answered it with a very powerful article. If he, who has been subjected to this shameful slander, remains unmoved, that is his own business, and I do not want to say more. This morning, in your editorial, you did not approve of the implementation of sanctions against Japan and boycotting Japanese goods, and you thought that Britain could be a mediator in the Sino-Japanese dispute because Britain should be considered a friend to both sides. I know that mentioning the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, or the Kellogg-Briand Pact is enough to cause laughter. I admit that those who laugh have reason to ridicule the issue of treaty obligations. However, as a Briton, I secretly think that our country cannot be a mediator in this tragedy, and I think that Britain should not be a friend to both sides, but should realistically announce and fully express sympathy with China. The reasons are as follows: ㊀ Britain, China, and Japan are all signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty, which states that whenever the signatories believe that the overall situation requires full and frank discussion, it should be discussed. Japan replied that it could not tolerate foreign interference. ㊁ Britain, China, and Japan are all signatories to the Paris Pact, which states that the contracting parties shall not resort to war to resolve international disputes, regardless of how they arise or what their nature is, and all must be resolved by peaceful means. Japan replied that it would fight China to the end. ㊂ China proposed that all Chinese and Japanese troops in North China should be withdrawn, and the Lugouqiao Incident should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations. Japan refused this proposal, and the war broke out and quickly spread to the entire China. Britain and China are both members of the League of Nations. Japan withdrew in anger because of its opposition to the League of Nations' resolutions and recommendations regarding its invasion of Manchuria. China has applied to the League of Nations, and if the League of Nations pays attention to it, it can take effective measures to show that member states disapprove of Japan's actions. Now, your attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute is that you believe that implementing sanctions will cause harm, so it should be avoided. You also strongly disapprove of boycotting Japanese goods as an expression of British public opinion, saying that it will only increase and not eliminate the war. This is the reason why you oppose the implementation of sanctions against Japan. Furthermore, you believe that formal sanctions and informal boycotts will prevent Britain from acting as a mediator in the Sino-Japanese dispute when the time comes. Indeed, mediation cannot be combined with concrete actions against any party, but why should Britain take such a neutral attitude in this case? Some may argue that China is "anti-Japanese" and is united with communism, just wanting to force all "foreign devils" to leave their country. Let us assume that their words are true, but Japan's errors in the above three points are facts. Therefore, Britain's position should not be to stand by as a neutral person, waiting for others to ask it to mediate, but should realistically announce that it stands on the side of the victim. However, it is impossible to hope that the government will make such a frank declaration. Mr. So-wei-bi is now advocating the conclusion of a new treaty to protect Shanghai, saying that this is a treaty with "sharp teeth." The League of Nations Covenant is not without sharp teeth, but the great powers dare not use it for reasons that politicians consider extremely satisfactory. This is also the case for the great change of September 18, the atrocities committed in Abyssinia, and the "accidental event" in China today. British citizens have no reason to say that they should not take the only remaining path, which is to boycott Japan in every possible way to show that they do not approve of Japan's actions. The British people have always had a reputation for upholding justice. If they cannot order their government to publicly state that they do not approve of Japan's invasion of China and disregard for treaty obligations, then they should at least refuse to spend a penny to help the country that completely despises its words.

[Geneva] The subcommittee of the League of Nations Advisory Committee held three consecutive meetings today to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute, lasting more than twelve hours. There are no longer any differences in internal opinions. The three countries of Britain, France, and China have reached an agreement on the following principle, that is, there are some facts that can be verified and have been proven to be true, and the draft resolution of the subcommittee should be a reasonable conclusion of these facts. The subcommittee held its first meeting in the morning, when it examined the report submitted by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol. The content is divided into three points: ㊀ The origin and development of military actions in the Far East; ㊁ The obligations of Japan to China in accordance with the Paris Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty; ㊂ The obligations of Japan to other countries. The representatives of Poland and China had a verbal battle during the discussion. The Polish representative argued that the subcommittee should draft a report describing the history of the Sino-Japanese dispute, and said that the prestige of the League of Nations had been hit once in 1931, and now it should be cautious in dealing with the Far East issue. The Chinese representative, V.K. Wellington Koo, refuted it, saying that the subcommittee could not just draft this kind of report to evade responsibility. The second meeting was held at 3:30 p.m. to continue the discussion. The last meeting was held in the evening and ended at midnight, when the draft report was completed. Its content traced the events of the Far East incident and explained Japan's obligations under the Paris Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, as well as the fact that Japan violated these obligations. The chairman of the subcommittee, Latvian Foreign Minister Munters, will use this report as a basis, together with the League of Nations legal experts, to draft the final resolution. People in the British delegation declared after the subcommittee adjourned that the draft resolution would be submitted to the Advisory Committee for a vote and then passed by the League of Nations General Assembly. "The tone of the draft is firm, and it should be at least equal to the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on the Spanish issue." (Havas Telegram, 2nd, Central News Agency)

[Washington] The Scripps-Howard newspapers claimed today, "If the League of Nations invokes the covenant to punish Japan, then we can expect that the United States will also take similar actions. Of course, the United States will not directly participate in the League of Nations' resolution, but it will not do anything to hinder the League of Nations' efforts to make Japan realize its mistake."

### The Spanish Case Was Rejected by the League of Nations General Assembly

The Resolution Drafted by the Committee Was Abandoned Due to Opposition from Portugal and Other Countries

⊙Geneva The resolution on the Spanish issue, which was established by the Sixth Committee of the League of Nations on Thursday after overcoming many objections, was rejected by the League of Nations General Assembly today. Portugal and Albania voted against it, and fourteen other countries abstained. Thus, the case failed to obtain the legal unanimous consent and was defeated. The representatives of South Africa, Southern Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Bolivia, Venezuela, Albania, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Switzerland, and Portugal all expressed their opinions, believing that this case could not improve the Spanish issue, and the recognition of foreign volunteers stationed in Spain and the statement that the policy of non-interference would be reconsidered if the negotiations for the withdrawal of volunteers failed were particularly unsatisfactory to the public. Therefore, South Africa, Argentina, Austria, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Chile, Cuba, Hungary, Southern Ireland, Panama, Peru, Switzerland, Uruguay, and Venezuela all did not vote. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd, Central News Agency)

[Geneva] The Irish Free State today advocated for the small countries that sympathize with fascism in the League of Nations General Assembly and opposed the United Kingdom, France, and the United States' request that Mussolini withdraw the volunteers currently in Spain. The vote resulted in thirty-two countries supporting the committee's recommendation, six countries opposing, and fourteen countries abstaining. Therefore, since this recommendation must be approved by everyone to pass, it has been abandoned. The President of the Irish Free State, Eamon de Valera, believed that if Mussolini was forced too much, the precarious peace in Europe would be in greater danger. The representative of the Spanish government still firmly stated that he would continue to work hard to make the League of Nations declare the United States and Germany as aggressor countries. (National Telegram, 3rd)

⊙Geneva According to responsible sources, the amendments proposed by Austria and Hungary when the League of Nations General Assembly discussed the resolution on the Spanish issue today were at the suggestion of Italy. Italy had already decided on the future talks between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. If Germany did not participate, it would refuse to attend. Since it did not want the League of Nations General Assembly to pass a resolution stipulating that the three countries should talk, if it failed, the current non-interference method in the Spanish Civil War should be terminated, so it tried to obstruct it at the last minute. However, the result of the vote was that the amendment was rejected. In addition, the representatives of the United Kingdom and France held talks with the representatives of Austria and Hungary all day today, asking them not to vote against the League of Nations General Assembly resolution. Austria and Hungary finally abstained and did not act in concert with Albania and Portugal. The United Kingdom and France were very satisfied with this. The representative of the Spanish Republican government, the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Asgarade, recently gave an interview to a reporter from Havas, saying that although the result of today's vote in the League of Nations General Assembly was not unanimous, it lacked value in law, but the significance of the resolution was still very important. All countries that voted in favor must recognize that they are bound by it. It is now generally believed that Spain should submit the entire issue of the Spanish Civil War to the League of Nations Administrative Council, hoping that the Administrative Council will pass a resolution to decide the future of the non-interference policy, so that it will have value in law. (Havas Telegram, 2nd, Central News Agency)

⊙Geneva It is generally believed that this move is enough to show the attitude of the vast majority of member states, and its political significance is extremely important. As for the mediation work currently being carried out by the United Kingdom and France, they should continue to work hard in accordance with the spirit of the resolution, because most member states have given their support in spirit.

### The United Kingdom and France Issue Notes to Italy

Convening a Three-Country Meeting to Discuss the Volunteer Issue

[Rome] The British Ambassador, Sir Grummond, and the French Chargé d'Affaires, Blanc Tal, jointly delivered notes from their respective governments to the Italian Foreign Minister, Ciano, at 5 p.m. today, inviting Italy to conduct negotiations to discuss the issue of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War. Foreign Minister Ciano promised to consult with Prime Minister Mussolini and submit a reply. According to reports, it was originally believed that Italy would definitely refuse to discuss the matter without the participation of Germany. However, the United Kingdom and Italy will soon hold talks to promote bilateral relations. Therefore, the general public attaches great importance to the British Ambassador and French Chargé d'Affaires' visit to Foreign Minister Ciano today. (Havas Telegram, 2nd, Central News Agency)

[London] The British Commonwealth Government recently issued a note to the Chairman of the Committee for Adjusting the Non-Interference Method in the Spanish Civil War, Lord Plymouth, the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, saying that the supervisory system of the non-interference method has failed and the Adjustment Committee must file it. Therefore, the supervisory method of the Spanish land border should be abolished in the same way as the sea surface supervisory method, and the land border between France and Spain should be opened. (Havas Telegram, 2nd, Central News Agency)

[Berlin] Political figures here attach great importance to the note submitted by the Soviet Russian government to the Nongyu Association, requesting the opening of land supervision in Spain, so that military supplies can be returned to the Spanish government. According to reports, the French Foreign Minister Dalbos also made a threat to open the Pyrenees border when he met with the Italian Ambassador in Geneva. Therefore, this move by Moscow is obviously intended to materialize France's threat, and it is hoped that London will stop this aggressive movement. (National Haitong Telegram, 3rd)

[Moscow] The Soviet Union's Foreign Ministry has denied the news reported by many European newspapers that the Soviet Union sent a letter to the Non-Interference Committee in the Spanish Civil War, requesting the opening of the Spanish border so that troops and war equipment could be freely transported in to support the Valencia government.

### The Canadian Peace Association Demands Sanctions Against Japan

The Anti-Japanese Movement in the United Kingdom Is Resumed; The Leader of the Liberal Party Condemns Atrocities

⊙Toronto The National Executive Committee of the Canadian Peace and Civil Liberties Association today wrote to the Canadian Prime Minister, King, asking him to immediately adopt sanctions against Japan, an aggressor country. The association also advocates boycotting Japanese goods. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd, Central News Agency)

[London] Lord Meston, Chairman of the British Liberal Party, recently published an article asking all Liberal Party organizations across the country to do their best to condemn Japanese atrocities. The article said, "How can we sit at home and imagine the tragedy in China? Japan is extremely vicious, like a devil's cruel behavior, deliberately and repeatedly committed, simply the worst barbaric behavior in history, and expelling Japan from the realm of civilization, measures that can make our protests effective, are not our responsibility. What we can do is to express to the government that we are willing to support any plan that the government will adopt to stop this horror and make this atrocity never happen again. We should at least participate in arousing the moral consciousness of our country and the world, and share our righteous indignation." (Reuters Telegram, 3rd, Central News Agency)

[London] The Executive Committee of the Scottish District of the opposition Labour Party recently issued a declaration, calling on the party's branches and trade unions to "express their deep disgust at Japan's unprovoked attack on Chinese civilians in a scientific and barbaric manner," and asking the British government to take the initiative to work with countries around the world to implement the following measures: ㊀ Implement the League of Nations Covenant, ㊁ Immediately sever diplomatic, economic, and social relations with Japan, ㊂ The member states of the League of Nations should prohibit Japanese ships from entering their ports, ㊃ Prohibit the sale of various goods to Japan, ㊄ Do not sell various raw materials and materials that can be used for military purposes to Japan. The conclusion is that the British government should solemnly declare that, once it obtains the approval of other countries, the United Kingdom will submit all international disputes to the International Court of Justice for processing.

⊙Wellington, New Zealand The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Savage, announced today that the Labour Federation and the Port Workers' Federation have agreed to persuade the unions affiliated with the federation to work for Japanese ships.

The Arabs seem surprised to see the government taking unexpected measures, but there is no real reaction yet. The Arab general strike scheduled to be announced today has already been implemented in Jaffa, where public sentiment is very agitated, but no incidents have occurred yet.

Due to Losses in the Shanghai Battles

[Nanjing] According to reliable financial sources, the market prices of various Japanese stocks, such as Kanebo (鐘紡), Teijin (帝人), and Japan-Russia Fisheries (日俄漁業), are declining daily. As of the end of September, many have fallen to 40% of their pre-China invasion prices, with some falling to over 30%, an unprecedented phenomenon in recent years. While this is closely related to the current tax increase bill and the implementation of capital adjustments, the fundamental reason for the instability is the losses in the Shanghai battles, causing apprehension and unease in industry and commerce.

### Japan Attempts to Conceal and Falsely Accuse Our Fishing Boats of Carrying Weapons

The Crime of Massacring Fishermen is Clearly Exposed; The Brutal Face Has Long Been Revealed

[Nanjing] Enemy submarines have repeatedly sunk our country's fishing boats off the coast, resulting in the deaths of 500 fishermen and drowning, with only 50 survivors. The detailed circumstances have been widely reported in Chinese and foreign newspapers. The Hong Kong government, since all fishing boats are registered in Hong Kong, ordered a detailed investigation. According to reports from rescued fishermen and conversations with crew members of the German ship "Hohenfels", the enemy's brutal massacre of non-combatants is an undeniable fact. Public opinion in various countries has strongly condemned it. The enemy, knowing they are in the wrong, and violating public law and humanitarian principles, have provoked public outrage. Initially, they dismissed it as unfounded rumors. Then, they falsely claimed that their submarines were elsewhere conducting exercises. Their clever sophistry has further aroused the resentment of civilized nations. The British Trades Union Congress and the Archbishop of Canterbury, among others, have proposed joint economic sanctions. The enemy, realizing they can no longer deny the truth, issued a statement on the evening of the 1st through the Navy Ministry's adjutant. According to Domei News Agency, the adjutant avoided mentioning fishing boats, instead stating that Chinese sailing boats come in various types, with larger ones capable of carrying 500 tons of cargo and equipped with machine guns and cannons. They listed "examples" of Japanese warships being attacked by armed sailing boats, claiming that "the Japanese military, for self-defense, had no choice but to suppress their attacks. The resulting damage was self-inflicted and had nothing to do with Japan." Whether our fishing boats are equipped with weapons is best known by the registering authority, the Hong Kong government, requiring no further debate. As for the claim of attacking Japanese warships, it is even more ridiculous. Japanese news outlets are very effective at spreading information. As a rule, before any action, they fabricate facts and falsely accuse us of acting first, as a basis for attacks and destruction. If they are abandoning the term "fishing boat" and using "sailing boat" instead, then there is no doubt that our civilian sailing boats will be subjected to indiscriminate bombing. If they claim that fishing boats are also considered armed sailing boats in the eyes of the Japanese, then why didn't the Japanese announce the attack on their warships on the day the damage occurred, waiting until after global condemnation and failed denials to offer this retrospective account? The butcher's brutal face has long been exposed. Attempting to cover up only reveals their growing anxiety. (3rd, Central News Agency dispatch)

### Japanese Right-Wing Elements Strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact

Desiring to Transform it into a Military Alliance; Currently, this Move is Highly Unlikely

[Nanjing] Japanese domestic right-wing elements have recently been loudly advocating for strengthening the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact. According to a certain foreign observer here, this Japanese proposal is merely wishful thinking. Their so-called strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Pact seems to aim to transform it into a military alliance. However, there is a widespread belief in Japan that, under the current circumstances, hoping for Germany to jointly invade Russia with Japan is impossible. Last autumn, Japan dispatched Lieutenant General Watanabe to Germany to exchange views with German military authorities, intending to conclude an agreement and obtain this consent, but it was unsuccessful. Furthermore, the German industrial and commercial sectors now also oppose a Japan-Germany alliance, as the current Sino-Japanese conflict has caused considerable losses to German trade with China.

These great achievements are evident to all. We admire your hard work and deeply respect you. Now that your health is gradually recovering and you are departing for a change of scenery, Xiaolai and others, looking up at your departing banner, although it is only a temporary separation, feel a deep sense of attachment. We respectfully offer this flower basket for your enjoyment and hope for your early return to comfort the hopes of people at home and abroad. We eagerly await this. Respectfully, and wishing you well," etc. The authorities also sent personnel to accompany senior officials from the British Embassy to the dock to see him off. Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's wife also traveled with him. According to sources from the Huadong Reporter, the Philippine government has granted Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen two months of leave for his recuperation in the Philippines. Therefore, after two months in the Philippines, he is expected to return to Shanghai in December.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Economic Severance with Japan

— Appropriate

The development of Japanese imperialism has always been based on the Chinese market. Economic severance with Japan is undoubtedly our most effective and necessary means of resistance. The boycott movement of the fourth year of the Republic (1915) dealt such a profound blow to Japan. Everyone should still remember that.

The Shanghai business community only formally launched a national economic severance with Japan after fifty days of all-out war. This is worthy of deep contemplation.

I think that many of our businessmen have been too deeply drugged by the theory of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in the past. They thought that it was only the Japanese warlords who were invading us, and that the Japanese zaibatsu were still good friends. Little did they know that the rise of the Japanese military's power is a natural demand of Japanese imperialism. The Japanese warlords must support the war of aggression. And military aggression and economic aggression are two sides of the same knife that slaughters our nation.

Now more than 100 Shanghai trade associations have unanimously supported the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's declaration of economic severance. We hope that this movement will rapidly spread throughout the country. Just look at how enthusiastically the people of friendly nations are carrying out boycotts of Japanese goods out of sympathy for our country. We have suffered at the hands of the enemy. If we still do not thoroughly awaken, wouldn't we become the most shameful numb nation in the world?

### Letter to Compatriots in the Northeast

Compatriots in the Northeast—

You are all Chinese who speak Chinese, you are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Why are you acting as cannon fodder for foreign devils from the East who speak a different language and have different blood?

The graves of your ancestors are being trampled by foreign devils. Your homes and fields are being occupied by foreign devils. Your parents and siblings are being enslaved by foreign devils. Your five hundred million compatriots, who have shared the same ancestors, language, customs, and ethics for thousands of years – all of us are being bullied by foreign devils. Compatriots in the Northeast! Haven't you recognized who your enemy is today?

No, I think you have already recognized them. However, since the "September 18th Incident," you have been living an inhuman life under the iron hooves of foreign devils; you are being oppressed everywhere and have no freedom anywhere. Although many compatriots in the Northeast have engaged in countless heroic struggles with the foreign devils, their strength is too small, and their hearts are willing but their power is insufficient. However, I believe that you are not discouraged by this, and that you are only waiting for the opportunity to come, and that you will wage an unprecedented decisive battle with the foreign devils to wash away the shame you have suffered in the past; to avenge all the suffering compatriots, to win back a breath for your ancestors, to seek a way out for your future generations! Compatriots! In the past six years, you have endured countless hardships; we compatriots in the mainland have not forgotten you for a single moment, nor have we stopped wanting to help you for a single moment, but the mountains and rivers are far apart, and we cannot get the opportunity. But now the time has come! We are fighting because we do not want to be slaves to a conquered nation, and we do not want our compatriots, who share the same ancestors, language, and blood, to live forever under the iron hooves of foreign devils – that is, to help you. We have officially started the war with the foreign devils, and we have won great victories in Suiyuan, Hebei, and Shandong; one part has already entered Rehe through northern Chahar, and we are about to fight back to your hometown, compatriots! This is an opportunity that has not been available in the past six years! Near Shanghai, we have wiped out more than 30,000 enemies, shot down more than 200 of their planes, and captured countless prisoners; now the enemy can no longer resist, and no army dares to attack, so they are forcing you to come from the Northeast to be cannon fodder. Compatriots! How vicious the enemy is! However, this is also the opportunity for us to take revenge and avenge our shame. Let us all join together and aim all our guns at the foreign devils to vent this anger!

We know very well about your current suffering, that you are being monitored by foreign devils and cannot drag your guns over here; at the same time, your families are being held hostage by the enemy in the rear, and you cannot escape, and we hate this very much for you! So we are now about to counterattack, compatriots! This is a matter of life and death. If you do not quickly organize yourselves, kill the foreign devils, and join us in fighting back to our hometown, then you will never have the opportunity to tell of your suffering. At the same time, you must think that if you still do not dare to act and want to help the enemy attack our compatriots who are resisting the war, then your lives will also be lost, and who will take care of your wives, children, and parents? Compatriots in the Northeast! This is the final juncture. Everyone make up your minds. When we attack or the enemy wants you to attack us, kill all the foreign devils, bring your guns, and join us to wipe out the enemy completely, and then kill them all the way back to the Northeast! At that time, not only will you preserve your wives, children, and families, but you will also avenge your ancestors, make great contributions to the country, and the government will definitely reward and treat you well, wouldn't this be the best way out? Compatriots in the Northeast! Make up your minds! Let us all join together and charge towards our enemy! Charge! Kill all the foreign devils whom we cannot live under the same sky with! Our slogans are:

Chinese do not fight Chinese!

Fight for revenge and to avenge our shame!

Kill all the foreign devils and fight back to our hometown in the Northeast!

### Customs Brokers Discuss the Import of Enemy Goods from Hong Kong

Disguised and Reshipped to the Interior for Dumping; Hope for Close Attention from All Parties

According to statistics on import and export trade released by the Japanese, a large number of goods are still being transported to our country in the past month, which has attracted the attention of various circles in our country, and they all advocate that economic severance with Japan should be realized immediately. According to people in the customs brokerage industry here, since the August 13th Anti-Japanese War, there has indeed been no import of enemy goods in this city. Other ports such as Guangdong and Xiamen, as well as the Yangtze River area, have also had no enemy goods shipped to them. At the same time, because most of the coastal areas have been closed to ports, it is also difficult to import private goods. However, in Hong Kong, unscrupulous merchants import a large number of enemy loans, disguised as domestic goods, and transported them to various places by foreign ships, and the number is also not small. Therefore, merchants in various industries should pay close attention.

### Securities Exchange Public Bond Transactions Settled as Scheduled

### We Continue to Make Progress in Jiangwan, Enemy Troops Fiercely Attack Our Zhabei Position

Four Enemy Giant Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb, Enemy Aircraft Surrounded in Air Battle over Western Shanghai, Fierce Battles Near Guangfu Today

The enemy is using its full force of naval, land, and air forces to attack the left flank of our line from Luodian to Liuhang Gujiazai. For days, our army has fought bloody battles and repeatedly frustrated the stubborn enemy. The Liuhang Gujiazai area has become the center of fierce battles. Our army has killed thousands of enemies, destroyed many enemy tanks, and captured countless military supplies. The enemy's artillery fire has been constantly bombarding day and night, with a total of more than 10,000 rounds in the past few days, which can be said to be extremely wasteful, hoping to achieve a fluke victory. Our army, because the goal of attrition warfare has been achieved, in order to avoid excessive sacrifice, has automatically moved our left flank position 1,000 meters to the west. The fortifications of the new position are more solid, and we will give the enemy a head-on blow. This newspaper's reporter met a foreign military expert this morning, who deeply praised the bravery of our army. He felt that this time, the rapid and orderly withdrawal to the west was particularly appropriate. He said that the enemy is still continuing to shell our empty positions, not daring to go deep. Although the enemy has temporarily gained control of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, its general military losses in recent days have exceeded our imagination. It is not worth it to obtain progress of hundreds of meters at such a price. In addition, the enemy's military plan is to concentrate heavy troops to attack our left flank, while at the same time transferring a part of the elite infantry in the city center to Zhabei to attack our right flank, attempting to cut off our Jiangwan Miaohang line. Fierce battles have been raging in Zhabei for days. Street fighting is extremely advantageous to us. In the melee, the enemy's casualties are numerous. From last night until this morning, the enemy's artillery has been constantly bombarding our Zhabei position. The enemy is using tanks as cover and constantly attacking us, but they have been repelled. Our line stands firm.

In Jiangwan, our army has advanced to the vicinity of the International Recreation Ground because the enemy forces west of the city center have withdrawn.

(Special report from this newspaper) This morning, a reporter from this newspaper received the following news from the front lines: 1. After withdrawing one kilometer from the line of Liuhang Gujiazai Changbang, our army is holding on to the newly built strong fortifications, and is preparing to counterattack within days. The area west of the Diging River along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway is our army's警戒 line. The North Taiping Bridge in Liuhang has been destroyed by us. Although there are now a small number of enemy troops crossing the river, the enemy's heavy weapons still do not dare to advance west easily. 2. Fierce battles have been raging east of Shixianggong Temple for days. Our army is holding on to the dangerous terrain and constantly sending large forces to pursue and attack, but the enemy has never dared to advance. 3. The enemy east of Caowang Temple has been heavily shelled by our heavy artillery, and has suffered heavy casualties. Knowing that they cannot succeed, they are already showing signs of retreat. 4. Guangfu Town, five miles west of Liuhang, has been ravaged by enemy aircraft for days and has been reduced to scorched earth. 5. There have also been battles near Xiaotangzi, southwest of Luodian, but they are not very fierce. Our army is holding on to the Lianqi River in that area. The fortifications are solid, and there will be no problem in a long battle.

### Our New Position's Fortifications are Solid

Enemy Concentrates Fire to Fiercely Attack Our Guangfu, Liangtang, and Other Positions, Fierce Bloody Battles

Since the battle of Liuhang shifted south, extremely fierce battles have taken place in the suburbs of Gujiazai Shenjiazai and the surrounding areas in recent days. Yesterday, the enemy again used aircraft and artillery to concentrate fire and fiercely bombard our positions near Guangfu, west of the road between Luodian and Liuhang. Bullets rained down, but our army's positions stood firm. At the same time, its infantry launched a fierce attack on our line along Bailiangtang Beiluzhai. Our army bravely fought back, pouncing on the attacking enemy. Our artillery also retaliated. In addition to the infantry fighting, artillery fire was also fierce. From dawn in the morning until 4:00 PM, the fierce battle stopped. The bloody battle lasted for dozens of hours. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, but was unable to cross the Lei 池 one step.

Last night, the enemy's artillery fire fiercely attacked our Liangtang Beiluzhai west, and Beimeizhai area overnight, with more than a thousand rounds falling. This morning at dawn, a battalion of enemy infantry, with six tanks as a guide, covered their advance. Enemy aircraft were very active, and a fierce bloody battle broke out along the entire line. As of noon, the fierce battle has not subsided.

### The Enemy's Attack on Zhabei Comes to Naught

Fierce Battles on All Sides Since Dawn This Morning, Enemy Scampers in Different Directions, We Hit Them Head-On

(Special report from this newspaper) In Zhabei, the enemy's attacks have been particularly fierce in recent days. After a portion of the enemy forces west of the city center moved to Liuhang, another portion also changed course to attack Zhabei, apparently with other intentions, intending to encircle and attack the rear of our Jiangwan. For three or four days, extremely fierce street fighting has taken place in the area west of Baoshan Road, Fusheng Road, Guangdong Street, Baoxing Road, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Our army is calmly fighting back in that area and coping with it with ease. The enemy forces are dividing into small teams of one or twenty people each and scampering in different directions. They have been swept by our army with hand grenades and machine guns, and have suffered heavy casualties. They have retreated to the area of North Sichuan Road. Since dawn this morning, the enemy forces on all sides have again attempted to attack. For a time, the sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of pearls. More than a dozen enemy aircraft bombed Zhabei in rotation, dropping twenty or thirty bombs. Our army suffered very little loss. The enemy at Baoxing Road, Qiujiang Road, and Bazilu is still being severely beaten by our army and can do nothing.

This afternoon, four enemy giant bombers appeared in the sky over Zhabei and indiscriminately bombed. Our positions suffered very little damage. Our army in Jiangwan has advanced to the International Recreation Ground. Fierce battles have taken place this morning near Shixianggong Temple west of Luodian, near Guangfu southwest of Luodian Liuhang, and at various points south of Gujiazai and north of the Yunzaobang, and have not stopped as of noon.

From 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM this morning, the railway line about half a mile west of the North Station was bombed by enemy aircraft. Our artillery opened fire to attack. The area west of the Southern Baptist Church and north of the Makai Road Station was also bombed. There was also artillery fire at Qiujiang Road, Gonghe Road, the North Station, and the air field half a mile north of the Makai Road Station. There was also occasional fighting near Bazilu Heskell Road.

### Our Army Firmly Defends Shixianggong Temple

Enemy Troops Repeatedly Attack but are Repelled, 42nd Regiment Has Collapsed

In Luodian, our army is still firmly defending the line of Shixianggong Temple and Caowang Temple. For days, the enemy has been fiercely attacking our army on this line. More than a dozen enemy aircraft have been circling in the air, observing and releasing signals, indicating targets to the artillery behind. The enemy's artillery has then greatly bombarded, with more than a thousand rounds falling, but our army's positions are extremely solid and have suffered very little loss. The strength of the enemy's 42nd Regiment, which attacked this line, has also been mostly destroyed by us and has collapsed. Yesterday morning, enemy reinforcements joined in an attempt to attack. Enemy aircraft released a large number of smoke bombs to cover their movements. Yesterday, the fierce battle on this line did not stop all day, and was even more intense in the evening. Our army bravely charged forward, and the attacking enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. This morning, they already showed signs of collapsing.

### Enemy Aircraft Damaged in Air Battle over Western Shanghai

Many of Our Fighter Planes Pursue and Surround, Two Enemy Aircraft Injured, One Aircraft Has Crashed

(Special report from this newspaper) For days, enemy aircraft have been dropping bombs and bombing severely in Kunshan and Nanxiang. At around 6:00 AM this morning, more than a dozen enemy heavy bombers were circling over Luodian Liuhang and Nanxiang, dropping more than thirty bombs, but there was no major damage. At around 8:00 AM, when the enemy aircraft were complacent and preparing to return, suddenly twelve of our fighter planes flew in from somewhere and attacked the enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft hurriedly fought back. Within ten minutes, they scattered and fled. Four of them fled to the sky over Caojiadu in western Shanghai. Eight of our planes followed and pursued them, surrounding the enemy aircraft. For a time, the sound of machine guns in the sky was like a string of pearls. Two enemy aircraft were injured. The 旋斡 of Shanghai's Western District, I have seen two enemy aircraft crash near the bottom of Gordon Road Central Mint. Details are pending investigation.

At around 5:00 AM today, when it was still sparsely bright, thirteen enemy aircraft, including three teams of nine heavy bombers, flew to the southern city again, circling very low over Gaoyangmiao, Longhua, and Xujiahui in western Shanghai, constantly reconnoitering. After more than half an hour, they gathered and flew along Zhongshan Road towards Zhabei, and then indiscriminately bombed Zhabei until noon.

Starting at 6:00 AM this morning, twelve more enemy giant bombers, divided into teams of three, circled in the sky over Zhabei, and dropped more than a dozen bombs one after another. However, because they were flying too high and the targets were inaccurate, the bombs all landed on wasteland, causing us no loss.

At 5:45 AM this morning, a炮彈 fell at No. 2, Lane 163, Aierjin Road, injuring three men. At the same time, a炮彈 also fell near the Qianzhuang Guild Hall on Haining Road, injuring one man and two women, all of whom were sent to Renji Hospital.

### Enemy's New Mitsui Wharf Bombed

Our Placement of Explosives Exerts Power, Pudong Coal Industry Public Warehouse Also Damaged

At around 3:30 AM this morning, another loud explosion occurred in the Huangpu River, the sound resounding through the clouds. It was found that the new Mitsui Wharf of the Japanese-owned Qichang Warehouse in Pudong had been bombed again by our placement of certain explosives, sinking several wharves. At that time, houses and land within ten miles around were shaken, and residents were awakened from their sleep. They saw a ball of fire rushing into the sky, but it went out immediately. According to reports, the wharf had a large amount of coal piled up, and enemy ships frequently went to take coal. Last month, two wharves were sunk by our bombing. This is a continuation of the previous unfinished work of destruction, so that enemy ships cannot land to take coal again. The enemy ships in the Huangpu River were greatly frightened by this and fired frantically, bombarding Pudong indiscriminately. We also opened heavy artillery to retaliate, and the fierce battle lasted until dawn before it stopped. We did not suffer any losses.

Yesterday evening, enemy ships in the Huangpu River frequently opened fire to bombard our Pudong positions. At around 6:00 PM, they used flat-trajectory guns to bombard near Pudong. At that time, the Chinese Coal Industry Public Warehouse at the eastern end of Qichang Warehouse in Pudong was hit by a shell and caught fire. The warehouse had a large amount of coal piled up, and it burned quite fiercely for a time. The Pudong Fire Brigade drove to the scene, but was unable to get close because the fire scene was located on the front line of Pudong. The fire burned until midnight before gradually diminishing, but the embers were not extinguished, and it was still burning as of this afternoon, causing considerable losses.

### Red Cross Re-enacts Regulations on Rescue Badges

Shanghai Charity and Disaster Relief Association Issued to its Affiliates Yesterday for Compliance

After receiving the "Provisional Regulations on Rescue Badges Re-enactment" issued by the General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Shanghai Charity and Disaster Relief Association, the Refugee Relief Committee of the War Zone, has issued the regulations to all its affiliated shelters and the monks' rescue headquarters and branches stationed in the front, in order to prevent奸人 from mixing in and hindering military secrets, and to maintain credibility. The regulations are attached as follows: ㊀ In order to prevent奸人 from mixing in, hindering military secrets, and maintaining the credibility of this Association, we specially re-enact the Provisional Regulations on Rescue Badges. ㊁ All rescue personnel of this Association must fill out a volunteer form, stating that they will not participate in any work other than the purpose of this Association. ㊂ All rescue personnel who have filled out the volunteer form will be issued an armband and a staff certificate after being assigned a position by the Association. A photo of the individual will be pasted on the certificate, indicating the position, to show seriousness. ㊃ Rescue workers within the concession do not need to wear armbands. Their staff certificates are all stamped with the seals of the British and French工部局. If they are questioned, they should immediately hand over the credentials to prove their identity. ㊄ All rescue workers in the Chinese界 must wear armbands stamped by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs and hand over the staff certificate.

### British Labour Party Calls on Government to Impose Economic Sanctions Against Japan

Executive Committee Passes Motion Demanding Parliament Reconvene Early to Establish Stance; Cooperation with Other Nations Necessary, No More Appeasement

[London] The Labour Party's annual conference, scheduled to open tomorrow in Bournemouth, held a meeting of its National Executive Committee in the city today. The committee passed a motion on the Far Eastern situation, to be submitted to the conference for discussion. The motion argues that Parliament should reconvene immediately to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue (the British Parliament was originally scheduled to reconvene on the 21st of this month), and that it should cooperate with other nations to take various economic measures to halt Japan's actions against China. The motion states: "The conference warmly welcomes Major Attlee, Chairman of the Labour Party Parliamentary Group, who recently requested that Parliament convene early to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue in order to take all necessary measures to uphold international law and halt the shameful atrocities that violate humanity. The Chinese people, engaged in peaceful occupations on land and sea, are defenseless and have been subjected to brutal killings. The conference expresses its deep abhorrence and condemnation of these atrocities. If other nations continue to turn a blind eye to these barbaric methods of warfare, they will inevitably endanger world civilization and the safety of their own people. Therefore, these nations should no longer appease Japan. The conference strongly condemns Japan's unprovoked and planned acts of war against China over many years. It demands that the British government: (1) Prohibit its citizens from selling munitions to Japan or lending funds to Japan; (2) Work with other member states of the League of Nations and the United States to exert economic and financial pressure on Japan to halt its aggression against China; (3) From a humanitarian standpoint, provide medical and other assistance to the Chinese people. Furthermore, the conference calls on all compatriots to refuse to purchase Japanese goods to oppose Japan's barbaric actions." The Labour Party Parliamentary Group also held a meeting today to endorse Major Attlee's request that Parliament reconvene early. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 3rd)

⊙ Bournemouth: The National Executive Committee of the Labour Party met here today. Major Attlee, Chairman of the Labour Party Parliamentary Group, delivered a speech on boycotting Japanese goods, stating that all civilized nations worldwide have expressed outrage at Japan's barbaric actions. Japan's economy is inherently fragile, so a properly implemented boycott of Japanese goods could be successful. "The unsatisfactory global situation is largely the responsibility of Britain, because the British government has consistently appeased international situations in the past, refusing to address the root causes. For example, Japan's invasion of Manchuria, Italy's seizure of Abyssinia, and a certain country's military intervention in the Spanish Civil War are all clear acts of aggression. However, the British government has feigned deafness and blindness to these true facts. In short, the facts that are occurring in China today are a direct result of the British government's policies on collective security and disarmament. The British government only knows how to sympathize with the imperialistic nations of Japan and Italy, and does not understand that peace must be based on social justice," he said.

### Overseas Chinese Returning from Japan Talk About Widespread Discontent Among the Japanese People

Huge Military Expenditures, Increased Taxes, Unemployment Problems Worsening, Unreturned Overseas Chinese Urgently Need Relief

Yesterday afternoon, a group of 270 overseas Chinese returned from Japan and arrived in Shanghai. A reporter went to the New Customs Wharf to meet them, and interviewed Mr. Zhuang and others who had resided in Nara, Japan, for over 20 years. They provided detailed information about the current situation in Japan and the conditions of overseas Chinese in Japan. The details are as follows:

### Innocent Overseas Chinese Arbitrarily Arrested

Mr. Zhuang and others said that since the August 13th Shanghai Battle, overseas Chinese in Japan have been unable to read newspapers and magazines published in China. All such materials have been inspected and confiscated by the Japanese authorities. The only reading material available is the monotonous Japanese newspapers reporting the "victories" of the Imperial Army. Living abroad, we do not know the actual situation of the resistance war in China, so our anxiety and depression are beyond description. Therefore, those who can afford to return to China are eager to do so. Since the Shanghai Battle, all the actions of overseas Chinese have been closely monitored by the Japanese. If the Japanese authorities are even slightly dissatisfied, they arbitrarily arrest us. In Nara alone, over the past month, the Japanese authorities have innocently arrested as many as seventy or eighty compatriots. Regarding the disposal of the property of overseas Chinese in Japan, although the Japanese authorities have not explicitly ordered its confiscation, labor unions in various parts of Japan jointly agreed after the Shanghai Battle that if overseas Chinese in Japan want to return to China and sell their property in Japan, the purchase price should not exceed 15% of the original value. Therefore, if overseas Chinese want to return to China, the Japanese authorities have, in effect, confiscated their property. Although the Japanese authorities have repeatedly claimed to be responsible for protecting the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Japan, in reality, all the freedoms of overseas Chinese in Japan have been almost completely deprived. The total number of overseas Chinese in Japan is about 30,000. Two-thirds of them have already returned to China. The rest have not returned because they lack the means to do so. They hope that the authorities will provide relief.

Japanese People Full of Complaints

As for the situation in Japan, because Japan has mobilized three armies in Shanghai and North China, the total number is already very large. It appears that there are gradually no more troops to deploy in the country. Therefore, recently, it has begun to actively conscript soldiers. Many people in various regions have been forced to enlist. In terms of the economy, because Japan needs a large amount of military expenditure, it has increased various temporary taxes, greatly increasing the burden on the people. In addition, foreign trade has declined, there is overproduction, leading to sluggish sales and a sharp increase in excess imports. The cost of living has increased accordingly. The unemployment problem for the people has become increasingly serious. Therefore, the people are full of complaints, but because they are under the oppressive power of the warlords, they dare to be angry but dare not speak out.

Final Victory Will Surely Belong to Us

In summary, it can be seen that Japan is gradually showing signs of wavering. If we can persist to the end, resist to the end, and fight a protracted war, then the final victory will surely be in our hands. When Mr. Zhuang and others said this, the reporter, considering that they were tired from their journey, did not want to bother them further, and took his leave.

### League of Nations to Provide Financial Aid

This assistance plan is divided into three points: (1) The League of Nations will allocate 1,300,000 Swiss francs annually to assist China's epidemic prevention efforts; (2) The League of Nations Secretariat's current deposit of 300,000 Swiss francs will be immediately allocated for China's epidemic prevention; (3) Member states of the League of Nations will be asked to donate a total of 400,000 francs or more. The three items total 2,000,000 Swiss francs. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 3rd)

### Short Commentary

— Xiang

The Songhu Battle has lasted for over fifty days. The enemy has suffered heavy losses and paid a great price, yet they are still outside our first line of defense, unable to cross the line. However, the news coming from North China is mostly disappointing. Is it because the officers and soldiers are not risking their lives? Is it because the organization of the rear-area civilians is unsound? Or is it because those responsible for defending the territory are negligent, incompetent, and timid? It is truly incomprehensible. However, victory and defeat are commonplace in war. One more defeat means one more experience. We should rely on this experience and make persistent efforts to achieve final victory.

### On the Beijing-Shanghai Line

— Shi Ren

Farewell! Shanghai

As the train engine revved up its wheels, rushing along the winding tracks, the evening scenery of Shanghai gradually receded from the train window. With a sense of deep affection, the reporter cast one last lingering glance at the West Station, seeing the West Station and the suburbs of Shanghai shrouded in dark clouds, as if countless beacons were burning!

Ah! Sacred Shanghai, since August 13th, you have poured out the pent-up feelings in your heart, and you have ignited the sacred flame of all-out resistance for the Chinese nation, which makes me admire and love you. However, it is with this feeling of admiration and love that the reporter leaves you. Words cannot express the expectations I have for you.

The reporter's purpose in leaving Shanghai this time is to first go to Taiyuan, and then to other places, hoping to get a glimpse of the bloody battles on the battlefield. At the same time, I sincerely want to offer my own flesh and blood as fertilizer for the flower of freedom to bloom in the future. I silently ponder whether a weak scholar's life can withstand the life of a frontier soldier. Although I have doubts, the reporter's blood is already boiling. All the fetters of personal life and the affection between family members cannot bind the reporter's love for the land of my homeland! Therefore, at the moment of leaving Shanghai, although my heart is filled with thousands of emotions, after a moment, I gradually calm down, with only some tragic afterglow remaining in my heart. At the same time, facing Shanghai disappearing in the evening clouds, I sing a verse of praise:

"Until the day we meet again, until the day we meet again, may the glory of my God never leave you!"

Ah! But will we ever have a day to return and see each other again? My southern homeland that nurtured the reporter!

Random Thoughts on Songjiang

The third-class carriage is packed with pale-faced refugees, as if it were a tightly sealed can; the cries of children and the screams of women break the silence of the night.

To prevent bombing by enemy aircraft, the train only has two lights on, but they are covered with black cloth, casting dark shadows, accentuating the travelers' dim mood of displacement.

The train arrived at Songjiang. It was completely dark. There was nothing to see in the station except for one or two figures. Weeds stretched endlessly beside the station, and the chirping of insects reminded the reporter of the enemy's bombing of a Songjiang train the last time, so I suspected that the chirping of insects was the weeping of the lost souls of the refugees! It was unbearably bleak.

The train stopped for about an hour and then moved forward again, but stopped again after only ten miles because the iron bridge ahead was bombed, and the train could not pass. The passengers had to carry their luggage and wade across the bridge to the train on the other side. But because it was night, there were no lights, and the sleepers, soil, and rocks tripped people, it was truly a journey like the Shu Road. The reporter's luggage was difficult to simplify, but one box contained a dictionary, which was very heavy. The two shoulders were almost bursting, so I had to silently follow the crowd and move forward reluctantly. After reaching the train, the last few carriages were already full. I had no choice but to try to move forward through the passenger aisle in the carriage to the carriages in front, but because the passengers were crowded, the aisle in the carriage was already blocked. I could not move forward, nor could I retreat. All I saw was the wailing of babies and the sighs of rickety old people, which made the reporter deeply taste the misery of the displaced people. At the same time, even more than this kind of taste, is that the reporter caught a glimpse of the toughness and cohesion of the Chinese nation. That is to say, although the Chinese nation has suffered infinite trampling, pain, and misery, it can accept them one by one, but this kind of tolerance is by no means the tolerance of a servile nature, but the tolerance of wanting to achieve one's own goals through this kind of tolerance. All the trampling, pain, and misery cannot destroy their aspirations; just like the passengers in the carriage, although they are crowded and trampled, "or even shout 'I'm being crushed to death!'" they still eagerly seize their possessions, carrying, lifting, and moving forward in an aisle where they can only move one step in a minute; this kind of tough and cohesive character not only shows the characteristics of our nation, but also symbolizes the hopefulness of our nation's future.

Sudden Air Raid

The train from Shanghai to Beijing took a detour on the Sujia Railway. Many slogans alerting people were posted at major stations along the way, especially at Wuxi Station, which was the most thorough.

After arriving at Wujin, it was already bright. After waiting for about an hour, the train started again. When it arrived at Longtan, Xia Mountain was in sight, with layers of clouds. I thought that in this kind of weather, we would not encounter an air raid!

Finally, as imagined, the reporter arrived safely at Xiaguan at noon. There were military police checking at the station. Because the reporter was carrying a Japanese history book, I was thoroughly questioned before being released. But at this time, the air raid alarm suddenly sounded. Except for the passengers, everyone calmly ran away. Because the reporter had just arrived here, I was so panic-stricken that I did not know what to do. Fortunately, a passerby pointed to the air-raid shelter in the distance, so I carried my luggage and rushed to it. But the second alarm sounded again.

The air-raid shelter that the reporter took refuge in was dug under a rockery. It was already overcrowded. Rickshaw pullers, poor people, and passengers were all gathered together, so there was no so-called superiority or inferiority. The other two or three people who could not squeeze into the cave were lying on the weeds, using the grass to hide themselves and confuse the line of sight of the aircraft.

About thirty minutes after the second alarm, the buzzing sound of aircraft could be heard in the air, followed by the sound of bombing and anti-aircraft guns. According to a later investigation, it was known that a total of twenty-three enemy aircraft came, and seven of them sneaked into the city to drop bombs, but our side did not suffer any major damage.

When the enemy aircraft were soaring in the air, the people in the shelter were calm and composed, holding their breath and listening quietly. No one was making loud noises. Even two- or three-year-old children were not babbling. The good order showed the strictness of the peacetime air-defense training and the public's understanding of air defense.

About an hour later, the reporter jumped out of the cave because it was too hot inside and the sound of the aircraft had disappeared. Standing by the moat, I looked at the station from a distance. There was no one on the street, only some military police. When the all-clear alarm sounded at 2:15, the shadows of people reappeared on the street. The reporter observed Nanjing's air defense and felt that it had indeed reached a high standard. The calmness of the people and their mutual supervision—the condemnation of those wearing white clothes, etc.—were especially commendable. Thinking of the scene of Japan's air defense exercise last year, I felt that it was much inferior to China's. However, regarding Nanjing's air-raid shelters, the reporter believes that there are still shortcomings. The quantity is sufficient, but the quality is poor. Because of the rainy days for several days, the shelters have stored water, and the protective material on top of the shelter, in addition to sparse mud and wooden sticks, lacks solid fortifications. Therefore, this kind of air-raid shelter can prevent bombs and machine guns exploding outside the shelter, but cannot prevent bombs falling directly on the shelter. When ninety-six enemy aircraft attacked Beijing last time, a bomb fell directly on a certain air-raid shelter, causing the people inside the shelter to be scattered in blood and flesh. Therefore, it is hoped that the air-defense authorities of Beijing can gradually build more high-quality air-raid shelters.

A Tour of Beijing

It has been three years since I left Beijing. When I left Shanghai, I heard a broadcast on Japanese radio claiming that Nanjing had been turned into an "Avici" hell, and that various agencies had been turned into pieces of dust—at that time, I was half-believing and half-doubting, but I also thought that Beijing had suffered considerable losses!

However, the reality is inversely proportional to Japan's propaganda. The towering government agencies in Beijing not only still stand tall above the clouds, but even the small alleys are quietly without any traces of being bombed. The cultural institutions that have suffered the most damage from the air raids are more universities, such as the Literature Department and the Dentistry Department of Central University, the Central News Agency, the Central Broadcasting Radio Station, and other social enterprises such as the Central Hospital and the Xiaguan Electric Light Company.

In the eyes of the Japanese, today's Chinese cultural institutions are anti-Japanese propaganda agencies, and today's Chinese intellectuals are anti-Japanese elements. Therefore, due to this ignorant misconception, cultural institutions have become their targets of attack. Destroying National Central University is not enough. Then there is Tongji University, Soochow University, Fudan University, Central University..., at the same time, it is not enough to humiliate the students studying in Japan, but also to shoot the students in Tianjin and Beijing: this kind of destruction of culture is really hateful, but don't be pessimistic, we should remember that the Germanic nation once gave Western European civilization the Dark Ages, but soon there was the Renaissance era centered on Italy! Today, Japan is using vicious destruction on our culture. In the future, we will also have a splendid Renaissance era: no! Not only a Renaissance, but our glorious national revival era.

Accompanied by a friend, I toured the Central News Agency and Central University. The Central News Agency has been completely destroyed. Although the four walls are still standing, the doors and windows are dilapidated. The surrounding areas have also been affected. Central University also suffered considerable damage. Because the Central News Agency was destroyed, the next day's Central Daily News only published half the size of the Shenbao Evening News due to the exhaustion of news sources, and the size of other newspapers was even smaller; but recently the Central Daily News and Xinmin Evening News have restored the size of the newspapers after the Shanghai Battle (the size of Shenbao Evening News), and the other newspapers have become even smaller; although they are located in the capital, they are much more inconvenient to get all the news than in Shanghai.

Because the reporter was in a hurry to go north, I did not have time to stay in Beijing, so on the day after arriving in Beijing, I crossed Pukou and went north. Looking back at the vast Yangtze River, I felt refreshed. Remembering the sentence "The Master said, 'It passes on like this, not ceasing day or night!'" my heart was already like a peaceful realm. (September 29, 1937, Pukou)

### Suzhou Creek Crowded with Boats

Inland River Small Transportation Routes Open

Recently, Suzhou Creek has been crowded with boats, especially the section from Tianhougong Bridge in the east to Xinlaji Bridge in the west. They are intertwined horizontally and vertically, truly giving the impression of boats covering the river. Among them, there are also many inland river small transport vessels anchored in that section, such as Xiemao, Fumao, and Dayou. In addition to Xiemao towing refugee ships to Suzhou yesterday, the other small vessels are all under the dispatch of the Shipping Administration Bureau today and tomorrow, carrying passengers to Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and other places, so the shipping routes are quite active.

### Trade Associations Prevent Enemy Goods from Being Mixed in for Sale

Special Attention Should Be Paid to Counterfeit Goods

After Japan set up customs in Shanghai to collect commodity taxes, various industries, such as South goods, sugar, fruit, cotton cloth, hardware, woolens, etc., are deeply concerned that enemy goods will be mixed in and dumped on the market. Trade associations in each industry have sent people to conduct strict investigations. Moreover, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has declared an economic break with Japan. Therefore, all our people must not buy enemy goods again, and special attention should be paid to enemy goods that are impersonating other foreign goods. According to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency who inquired with the Customs, the goods that arrived in Shanghai recently, in addition to Japanese goods, had very few goods from other countries such as Britain and the United States.

### Municipal Government Establishes Children's Hospital

To Rescue Children Affected by the Disaster, Madam Hardoon Assists

In view of the fact that there are many children affected by the disaster after the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, and that epidemics have recently broken out, causing many deaths, the Shanghai Municipal Government has launched the establishment of a children's hospital for the purpose of providing relief. After Xu Shengchan, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, consulted with Mr. Yu Qiaqing to find a solution, Mr. Yu transferred the matter to Ji Juemi. As a result of Ji's consultation with Madam Hardoon, she generously agreed to lend a building at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road (the original site of the Ningbo Industrial Bank). Madam also expressed that when the children's hospital is closed in the future, she is willing to adopt homeless children. Preparations are underway for the personnel, medical, and material aspects of the children's hospital, and it will be realized soon.

### Overseas Chinese in Menggala Generously Donate 50,000 Yuan to Help Refugees

The Charity Federation Deeply Appreciates Their Concern for the Motherland

The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association sent a letter of appreciation yesterday to the Overseas Chinese Relief Committee in Menggala for donating a large sum of 50,000 yuan to help refugees and showing concern for the motherland, which is commendable and admirable. It also hoped for a continuous supply of assistance. The original letter is recorded as follows: In reply, we have received the large envelope and appreciate the generous donation of 50,000 yuan for the relief of refugees. We have already replied by telegram. We hope that you will understand and observe that the public are concerned about the motherland, compassionate for the displaced, and generously provide assistance from afar. The reputation of benevolence has spread, and the beneficiaries are not only the victims. The colleagues of our association are also inspired by righteousness. The merits are boundless. The Shanghai Battle has lasted for nearly two months. The people in the front have suffered the poison of the enemy, and bombings are everywhere. Homes are reduced to ashes, and flesh and blood fly horizontally. The inhumane situation is rejected by the whole world. It is the duty of this association to provide as much relief as possible, to organize rescue teams to go to the front line, to rescue the people from danger, to set up shelters to provide food and lodging, to set up hospitals to treat diseases, to send them away at any time, and to accommodate long-term evacuees. There are often 40,000 to 50,000 people. The cost of food, medicine, and all expenses now requires as much as 5,000 yuan per day. As the war prolongs and the area expands, refugees come one after another, never ceasing. Without rice to cook, the coming days will be difficult. We hope that you, the public welfare, will be generous and continue to provide assistance so that the relief work of this association can be carried out vigorously without fear of interruption. When the country is in trouble, saving the people is to save the country. Clouds and sky are full of hope. A receipt is attached, as well as a report on the work of this association. Please check it. This is what we hope for.

### Enthusiastic Exchange of Certificates by Real Silver Prize Savings Account Holders

The Central Savings Society, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, is reorganizing the Special Prize Savings of the China Industrial Bank. Starting from September 16th, it will first handle the certificate exchange procedures. Anyone holding a Class A certificate (i.e., 30 yuan) of the Special Prize Savings of the China Industrial Bank can exchange each certificate for one reorganized certificate of the Society, with a face value of 41 yuan and 66 cents in national currency, as a single full payment without having to pay any additional amount. If it is a zero-numbered savings certificate and the amount is less than the full number, the difference can be paid to make up the amount. If there are no funds to make up the difference temporarily, there are other mortgage methods to use the proceeds from the mortgage to cover the supplementary payment. Even if this certificate has been borrowed against and interest is owed, it still has the right to win prizes every month. Account holders can apply to the Society at No. 2 Dajin Road with their original certificates.

### Unimpeded Passage of Domestic and International Mail

Printed matter and books are being mailed as usual. As a result of efforts by the postal authorities to handle mail to and from Shanghai and overseas, mail from the Americas and Siberia to Shanghai is now rerouted through Japan. Therefore, it has been quite smooth for the past half month. For domestic locations and the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, transportation is provided by foreign merchant ships, which is faster than by land. Other areas in North China and the interior are also being mailed using extremely fast methods to avoid obstruction and delay. When the war first broke out, all printed matter and books were temporarily suspended from mailing, but this has now been restored to normal.

### Suspected Traitors Transferred to Court for Investigation

The Martial Law Command has decided that all suspected traitors apprehended from various sources for whom no evidence has been found will now be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court, where prosecutors will investigate whether there are any other criminal cases involved, and if not, they will be released on bail.

### Animal Society to Raise Funds for Animal Day Today

Today is World Animal Day. In order to expand the animal protection movement over the years, the Shanghai China Animal Protection Society has submitted a request to the Ministry of Interior, ordering the entire country to prohibit slaughter for one day, hoping to use government decrees to promote the idea of benevolence and patriotism in our society. Since the August 13th Shanghai battle, the Society believes that in this extraordinary period, psychological construction is essential for the nation, but material relief is even more urgent. The Society has therefore decided that this year's Animal Day should be dedicated to the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees. It is understood that the Society has already agreed with various radio stations in Shanghai to provide free broadcasts on animal protection, and that all donations to the Society's publicity expenses will be used for the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees. In addition, all members of the Society nationwide will be vegetarian for one day today, and the savings will be used to supplement relief funds.

### Feelings on Returning Home

[Z Wu Jisheng>

Wanting to return home, many feelings gathered, so I composed a few poems to express my feelings, to reveal the crimes of the Japanese invaders in China to the world, and to move the hearts of the benevolent to implement a comprehensive war of resistance.

Loyal friends have lived together for a long time, and it is unbearable to leave Shanghai suddenly. I especially feel that the road is long and it is difficult to meet again. When will my heart be free from sorrow?

I am grateful to my relatives and friends like Lei and Chen, and I cannot repay their kindness to express my heart. I only wish them peace and heavenly blessings, and that they send letters every year.

Loving peace and hating the enemy, it is difficult to avoid fighting on the battlefield. It is a pity that the soldiers are broken, but I envy those who leave their names in the national history.

The Japanese invaders bombed Shanghai fiercely, and innocent compatriots were trapped in misery. If I can return to my hometown now, I will also be heartbroken by the hoofprints and dust of the vehicles.

It is difficult for bombers to fly at night, so I took a night train all the way. Refugees are transported to avoid danger, and the kindness shown does not fall into vain.

Usually, everyone has a livelihood, but it is difficult to recover after being destroyed. Even swallows cry when they leave their nests, and it is even more sad to be ruined.

Internal strife has been absent for many years, and the survivors have gradually recovered. Before the vitality was fully restored, they were attacked by the Japanese invaders. It is heartbreaking and we vow to eliminate all evil.

The poor are forced by the Japanese invaders in Shanghai, and it is difficult to bring their families and children. They rely most on the benevolent for relief, and they celebrate their return home after escaping the tiger's mouth.
