[Nanjing] On the 17th, Chairman Wang met with reporters from various newspapers and news agencies in Taiyuan, as well as correspondents stationed in Taiyuan from other newspapers. The reporters raised questions about Sino-Japanese relations, the Communist bandits in the Northwest, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's health. Chairman Wang answered them one by one, speaking for about 30 minutes. Here is a record of Chairman Wang's remarks: (1) According to recent statements from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the arrival of the economic investigation group in China, there is much talk again about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. This is certainly what the Chinese people desire. However, past events are deeply imprinted in the minds of our entire nation and will never be forgotten. Therefore, no matter what, preparations for resistance must not be relaxed in the slightest. We must follow the declaration of the Third Plenary Session and work hard. For every minute we have, we must make a minute's worth of preparations. At the same time, we must always be prepared to make sacrifices. (2) If the Communist Party accepts the declarations and resolutions of the Third Plenary Session, then the central government should give them a path to reform. However, this is by no means tolerating communism. In the past, tolerating communism meant allowing the Communist Party to organize and propagate. Now, in this time of national resistance, we only have one path: that is, for the entire nation to unite and work together under a single goal and a single leadership for national resistance. Not only can the Soviet government and the Red Army not exist, but even the Communist Party's organization and propaganda cannot be tolerated by the doctrine of unity for national salvation. The theory of class struggle will inevitably incite riots and break up the entire front of national resistance. (3) It was reported a few days ago that Mr. Chiang will take a leave of absence for a month or two after returning to Nanjing, which may be true. However, this is only to prevent minor matters from disturbing Mr. Chiang's health so that he can recover sooner. As for major national policies, they will still be the responsibility of Mr. Chiang. We love and care for Mr. Chiang and sincerely hope for his early recovery. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 18th)

### European Travel Notes

â By Our European Correspondent, Lieshan

Twenty-two: The Logic of German Newspapers

Dr. Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda of Germany, is most proud of the fact that the tone of German newspapers has been unified under his command. Newspapers should be tools of the party and the government; this is the news policy of the National Socialist Party. National Socialists are particularly proud of the fact that German newspapers are all "unique and different from newspapers in other countries, not following the tide," exclusively publishing unethical news. In other words, the moral standards of German newspapers have been raised.

For example, last winter, King Edward VIII of England was in love with an American divorcee, which caused a conflict with Prime Minister Baldwin. Newspapers in various countries, even in England, reported extensively on this event. The only exceptions were German newspapers. German newspapers all published a notice stating that this event was an internal affair of the United Kingdom. German newspapers did not want to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, so they had to forgo this news. Therefore, they did not mention a word about it from beginning to end. It was not until after Edward VIII abdicated that many newspapers hurriedly issued extra editions, although by this day, most Germans already knew this story.

The opposite was the Xi'an Incident. When Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was detained, German newspapers immediately reported, based on news from the Japanese Domei News Agency, that he had been killed. On the other hand, they insisted that Mr. Zhang Xueliang was a communist. Thus, they used this as a pretext to attack the Communist Party at the expense of the Chinese. This rhetoric was no different from defending Japan's Far East policy. After Mr. Chiang Kai-shek returned unharmed and Chinese people in embassies around the world proved that China was a unified country, some German newspapers changed their original attitude, but some still said that the Chinese value face. Did Mr. Chiang Kai-shek lose face (?); was his position shaken? Therefore, the future of China is not optimistic. They even said that Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's leave of absence was purely a matter of face. In fact, we Chinese people are currently very aware of the seriousness of the national crisis and the need for unity. After the Xi'an Incident, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek not only did not lose "face," but on the contrary, his reputation among the people only increased. Because China needs Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. What the Chinese people cherish today is not Mr. Chiang Kai-shek personally, but the unity that has been achieved through great hardship.

In fact, the Xi'an Incident was precisely an internal affair of China. If German newspapers were willing to maintain their consistent stance of not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, then not only should editorials have a different attitude, but they should not even be mouthpieces of the Japanese Domei News Agency. Especially the rhetoric in the Ming Hsin News. We feel that this newspaper's comments on Sino-Japanese affairs are always more Japanese than the Japanese themselves. Perhaps this is where the straightforwardness of the Germans lies!

Twenty-three: What We Dare Not Say

In the eyes of Europeans, we Chinese are naturally an incomprehensible people, and similarly, Chinese customs are also an unfathomable mystery. Conversely, from the perspective of us Chinese, there are also many things in Europe that are unbelievable, such as the European concept of family.

Recently, I met a family. The father is a factory owner, and the mother is a widowed woman who has remarried. Her first marriage produced two sons. Traditionally, these two sons also live with their stepfather. The mother's first marriage only produced one daughter, a very presentable young woman of eighteen. Although the father is not yet fifty years old and has a very strong physique, the mother and daughter often argue about inheritance issues, even in front of the father.

Once, this family held a small banquet, and I was one of the guests. After the meal, everyone sat and chatted. Inadvertently, the topic turned to inheritance issues. The mother said, "Sir, look how unreasonable my daughter is. She told her father to give her all the property when he makes his will, and she will provide for my later years. Naturally, this is impossible." The daughter said, "Dad, isn't that right? After the inheritance is given to me, won't I take care of Mom? Isn't that right, Dad?" After she finished speaking, she gave her father a kiss affectionately. As a result, a conflict arose between the mother and daughter in front of the guests. As for the father, he just smiled and said nothing.

What we can understand in this situation is that the mother is thinking of her two sons. If the mother receives all the inheritance, then her two sons can at least get some. Precisely because of this, the young woman is unwilling. She naturally does not want her two half-brothers to share in this inheritance. However, what we cannot understand is that everyone is discussing his afterlife problems so openly in front of the father. We are not talking about any taboos, but what kind of feelings will such a conversation evoke in a healthy father! What makes us feel particularly strange is that all the guests present participated in the discussion, as if this were a very ordinary event. Everyone forgot about the father.

Europeans are, after all, Europeans. We Chinese would never dare to say such things.

Twenty-four: German Diplomats

A German said, "We have military men who are like military men, and we also have diplomats who are like military men. Part of Germany's tragedy lies here." Many people believe that the person primarily responsible for Germany's failure in the last European war was the German diplomatic corps. Some even say that in German history, apart from Bismarck, it is impossible to find a first-rate diplomat, although Germany has produced many famous generals.

The "Third Reich" is currently suffering from the same problem: a lack of good diplomatic talent. In all fairness, Europeans generally feel more terror toward Soviet Russia than toward Germany. But Germany does not have someone like Litvinov, so everyone feels that Germany is particularly terrifying. In recent years, Germany has been trying to forge a new path in diplomacy, but whether it will work is naturally a question.

One example: Last autumn, Dr. Greiser, the president of the Danzig Free City Council, represented Danzig at the League of Nations. After he finished his speech, he raised his right hand and gave a Hitler salute to the representatives of various countries. This not only caused the newspaper reporters from various countries in the audience to laugh, but even some of the diplomatic corps from various countries in the hall could not help but laugh. Dr. Greiser was angry. When he left the hall, he passed by the newspaper reporters' audience and specially made a face at everyone. The reporters from various countries naturally refused to let go, so a dispute arose. As a result, British Foreign Secretary Eden said that he did not see the grimace of Dr. Greiser, and the storm was temporarily calmed. The next day, newspapers from various countries said that Dr. Greiser's mistake was in regarding the League of Nations meeting in Geneva as an Arab street, which is why this joke occurred.

Another example: German Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mr. Ribbentrop (the signatory of the German-Japanese "Anti-Comintern Pact"), recently presented his credentials to King George VI of England and, instead of bowing according to British custom, he also gave a Hitler salute. In the eyes of the conservative British people, this was simply a deliberate insult. The British newspapers' antipathy toward this matter is naturally reasonable. According to the Hitler salute, in addition to raising the right hand, one must also shout: "Heil Hitler!" Why shout "Heil Hitler" to the King of England is something we cannot guess no matter what. Mr. Ribbentrop is a key figure currently in charge of German diplomacy. Perhaps he hopes to gain the respect and awe of the British in this way. If he really has such a thought, then he has misunderstood the British.

A French newspaper said that Russia and Italy are also new-style political systems, but their ambassadors bowed to the King of England as usual. Why is Germany especially happy to be an exception? I remember a joke that divides diplomats and women into two types of people. When a girl says "no," it means "maybe"; when she says "maybe," she has already agreed. A clever woman will never say the word "yes." The opposite is true of diplomats. A diplomat's "yes" is only equal to "maybe." When he says "maybe," it is already a "no." For example, Mr. Zhang asks Mr. Li to help with something. Mr. Li is a straightforward person who can directly refuse and say, "I can't." But if Mr. Li is a diplomat, he should say, "Maybe," or "Let me try."

The straightforward character of the Germans is sometimes lovely, but when applied to the diplomatic arena, it will make others "baffled."

Twenty-five: A French Female Reporter on German Men

Although Germany and France are only separated by the Rhine River, the two sides are two different worlds. Not only are the races, languages, and customs different, but even daily life has great differences. For example, good grooming is a habit of French women; even some men apply rouge and powder. Germany, on the other hand, is the opposite. Except for women in large cities, most German women are rough and do not carry powder compacts. Precisely because of this difference, hearing a French woman's comments on German men is naturally a very interesting thing.

About half a year ago, I accidentally met a French female reporter. When she heard that I also understood something about the current situation in Germany, our conversation focused on German issues. She said that for many years, she had been traveling to various parts of Germany almost once a year, with the purpose of listening to music. But since Hitler came to power, she had to cancel this customary trip because Germany no longer had real musicians. In her opinion, Hitler's crimes in art were more serious than everything else!

She said, "....German men? Ah! What a group of people who don't understand romance! Almost every German man is a soldier, at least containing the air of a soldier. The characteristic of a soldier is that he can give orders and obey orders. German men obey orders in the barracks during the day and give orders to their wives when they return home at night. This has almost become a habit. German men are the superiors of German women...."

"German men also have many advantages," she continued. "For example, they are good at organizing, their lives are disciplined, they have perseverance, they have a precise attitude when studying, and they have a complete theory, especially on political issues. Sometimes this theory is very wrong, but they have confidence and believe it is correct....However, what use are all these things to us women? They don't understand women, or they don't want to understand her. When they talk to you, they either tell you how good military exercises are, or they tell you that someone's theory has some weakness in some point, or they explain the wonderful use of some new type of machinery. We women want to hear this kind of dry and tasteless rhetoric, even war. You see, sir, this is the German man!"

"....What we women need to hear is tenderness, not a serious life problem. What we need is someone who understands our hearts a little, not a warrior. I often wonder if most German men understand the meaning of life at all?...." This was her conclusion.

This female reporter's statement is, of course, not without its pertinent points. However, we feel that letting French women criticize German men is like a Shandong man in the eyes of a Suzhou girl. The starting point is completely different.

Commentary

### Sincerity and Trust

â Beginning

Recently, some people have been very optimistic about national affairs because they have seen a new spirit of unity in the country. Others are pessimistic because they feel that this spirit of unity may disappear as easily as a fleeting flower.

Whether this spirit of unity can be sustained and whether national affairs can ultimately be optimistic, I believe, depends on the existence of two attitudes among the entire nation. What are those two attitudes? One is sincerity, and the other is trust.

To wholeheartedly accept these two attitudes, we must first ruthlessly point out our own shortcomings of insincerity and distrust. What time is it now? Can we still afford to avoid seeking medical treatment?

It must be frankly stated that until the present, although the entire nation has awakened to the idea of unity and cooperation, our actions may not fully correspond to this awakening. We still cannot avoid being insincere in our treatment of others, and we still cannot avoid being distrustful of others. If these two attitudes are not eliminated, the so-called unity will be like a paper lantern that cannot withstand even a slight breeze or light rain and will reveal its broken original form.

Sincerity means having nothing to hide or conceal and showing others that there are no hidden motives. If there is nothing to hide or conceal, then whether it is merit, fault, right, or wrong, it will be as clear as the sun in the sky, and everyone will be able to see it. At the very least, it will not arouse suspicion or misunderstanding. Throughout the past, many unexpected disputes encountered by those handling foreign affairs have been caused by insincere attitudes. As for showing others that there are no hidden motives, it involves the motive for doing things and is even more important than the previous point. If we promote something on the surface but harbor other calculations in our hearts or deliberately feint to the east while attacking the west, showing a straight face but concealing ulterior motives, that is even more likely to spoil things. Being frank and natural means having nothing to hide, and being sincere means that others will naturally not suspect that there are other motives. Sincerity is the general meaning of frankness and sincerity.

Trust means treating others with complete sincerity. Today, the Chinese people face the same destiny, bear the same tasks, and walk the same path. Since we want to hold hands and move forward together, how can we not treat each other with complete sincerity? Take resisting the enemy and defending against insults, for example. Under this general goal, the Chinese people should eliminate all suspicions, abandon all old grievances, and work together wholeheartedly. If there are still people harboring ulterior motives, thinking that some people are destined not to participate in the fortress of resisting the enemy and defending against insults, that is simply implementing a policy of suicide. A thinker once said something wise: Faith can produce the facts that are believed in. Conversely, without faith, the facts that are believed in will naturally never be produced. This statement can also be found in many examples in our ordinary interpersonal relationships. For example, there is a Mr. Zhang who is very good to Mr. Li, but Mr. Li does not trust Mr. Zhang, harboring ulterior motives and thinking that Mr. Zhang has no good intentions. Therefore, his attitude toward Mr. Zhang also changes. If this continues, even a good friendship will break down. People without faith often play out tragedies. They may not know that they are the creators of the tragedy.

Sincerity and trust are a ring; it cannot be formed if one is missing. If you are insincere to others, how can you ask them to trust you? If you cannot trust others, how can others be sincere to you? Therefore, in the present time when "the country will be destroyed any day now," we Chinese people, regardless of whether we are high or low, whether we are in the government or in the private sector, or what social class we belong to, should treat each other with sincerity and meet each other with trust. Only in this way will the so-called unity not become a superficial and forced union.

Perhaps some people think that the above-mentioned platitudes have the suspicion of "speaking on behalf of others." Then please pay attention to whether all Chinese people now have a common demand and a common program of action. Leaving aside right and wrong, before the theory and program of action are consistent, sincerity and trust may still be said to be not tolerated by strategy. Now that everyone is clearly calling for national salvation and survival in the same voice, can we still use such words to cover up and shirk responsibility?

Recently, many people have paid attention to the psychological transformation and construction of the people. We believe that sincerity and trust are the foundation of the psychological construction of the entire nation.

### Mussolini's Speech Expresses Hope that Britain and France Will Not Doubt Italy

His Visit to Africa Has No Hidden Secrets, Italy Wants to Live in Peace with All Countries, Belgian King to Visit England to Discuss Neutrality

â Tripoli Italian Prime Minister Mussolini held a ceremony here today to unveil a bronze statue of Caesar and gave a speech expressing hope that Britain and France would no longer doubt Italy. First, he said that he would not forget the League of Nations' attempt to block Italy's breathing. Then, he said that his visit to Africa had no hidden secrets or intention to invade others. The so-called democratic countries are making sensational propaganda, which is quite strange. In fact, Italy is willing to live in peace with the world both within and outside the Mediterranean Sea. Italy is willing to cooperate with anyone who expresses the same desire. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 17th)

[London] King Leopold III of Belgium is now scheduled to come here on the 22nd of this month for a three-day stay to hold important talks with the British authorities on the issue of this country's neutral status, especially the fulfillment of the obligations stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. What Belgium wants to obtain is "to have its neutral status guaranteed by the great powers, in other words, to have the great powers guarantee that no other country's troops will pass through the country to resist an aggressor." This is contrary to the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty and Article 16 of the Covenant. According to the general impression, Belgium may abandon its claim to "guaranteed neutral status" and only request the lifting of the obligations arising from the Locarno Treaty in order to restore full military sovereignty. As for the obligations stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant, they should still be adhered to in good faith. (Havas, Central News Agency, 17th)

### Two Million Workers in Paris Stage Half-Day General Strike

Protesting the Bloody Incident in the Suburbs, Implementing the People's Front Platform, Dissolving Fascist Groups

[Paris] Two million workers in the entire city staged a half-day general strike this morning in response to a notice from the General Confederation of Labor to protest the bloody incident in Clichy yesterday. The workers also held demonstrations in the factories and uniformly resumed work in the afternoon to show strict discipline. (National Telegram, 18th)

[Paris] Workers in various industries in the Parisian region affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor went on strike for half a day this morning and ended at noon. Public transport workers, according to the orders of the General Confederation of Labor, should not have participated in the strike, but they also stopped working and even resumed work early at about 11:00 a.m. so that workers outside the city could use public transport to come to Paris and resume work in the afternoon. In addition, all newspapers were published as usual, and civil servants also worked as usual. The city was very quiet. Political groups held lengthy talks to discuss how to deal with the changing situation. The People's Front held a meeting in the Clichy City Hall last night, attended by 3,000 people. The Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Doraire, and the leader of the far-left wing of the Socialist Party, Member of Parliament Bevan, gave speeches, demanding that the government dissolve all fascist groups, implement the entire People's Front platform, and purge the police organs. Subsequently, a resolution was passed advocating the establishment of a joint committee of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party in order to adopt various means to protect the people. The meeting ended without incident. (Havas, Central News Agency, 18th)

[Paris] The order for a half-day strike issued by the General Confederation of Labor last night seems to have been complied with by workers in various industries in the Parisian region. As a result, the activity in Paris this morning was not as great as usual. Shuttle buses stopped running from 7:00 a.m. Many citizens, because the strike order was issued late at night and they were not notified, waited for trains at the underground train station, but the underground trains had also been ordered to stop running, and they did not start running until 11:00 a.m. In addition, although employees and civil servants of public utilities worked as usual, the General Confederation of Labor ordered them to "adopt a method to show solidarity with other workers." It is noted that the strike movement is limited to the Paris region, and the situation is very quiet. As of 8:00 a.m., no incidents have occurred. (Havas, Central News Agency, 18th)

[Paris] The Paris Trade Union Coordination Committee recently issued a declaration to the workers of Paris, urging all workers to abide by discipline and not take any excessive actions. The purpose of holding a half-day general strike this time is to express the will of labor. What is this will? That is: ã All fascist groups should be immediately dissolved in their entirety; ã Colonel de la Rocque, the leader of the "French Social Problems Research Party," which was reorganized from the former Croix-de-Feu, should be immediately arrested; ã All anti-communist elements in the military, police, and public administration organs should be purged. In addition, the declaration also stated that the general strike was not intended to oppose the People's Front government. "The People's Front government should still be allowed to continue to hold power. The purpose of our general strike is nothing more than to support the government in its efforts to fight against the enemies of the people and all elements who have been bribed by foreign countries." (Havas, Central News Agency, 17th)

### Roosevelt Denies He Will Propose a Peace Plan

âWarm Springs, USA A report stated that the US government is currently planning to propose a peace plan at an appropriate time, with disarmament as its main focus. This statement was recently denied by President Roosevelt. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### Various French Left-Wing Factions Hold Meetings, Cracks in the Popular Front Deepen

Blum's Position Not Expected to Be Shaken; Interior Minister Announces Investigation into Bloody Incident

[Paris] Following the clashes between the fascist Social Studies Party and the Communist Party in the suburb of Clichy last night, which led to a bloody incident, it is generally believed that the position of the Blum cabinet will not be jeopardized. The General Confederation of Labor is also paying close attention and is determined not to create difficulties for the Popular Front government. The Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, Stonehouse, recently visited Prime Minister Blum and assured him that the unions affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor plan to hold a half-day general strike tomorrow at noon to protest. However, public utilities and civil servants are not included in the strike, so the local order is not expected to be affected. Today, the situation in the capital was as normal as usual, quiet throughout the day, with no incidents occurring. The police also did not take special preventive measures to protect public institutions and the Prime Minister's residence. Cabinet members held a meeting at 7:30 PM, which lasted for two hours. During the meeting, Interior Minister Daladier reported that a judicial investigation is currently underway, and the government has decided to take severe measures, strictly punishing anyone who violates the law. In addition, appropriate measures will be taken to maintain public order and social peace. After the cabinet meeting, cabinet members jointly issued a letter to the people of Paris, earnestly advising residents not to participate in any demonstrations that could disrupt public peace. They also stated that the working people have loyally supported the Popular Front government for ten months, which is commendable, and the government will continue to trust them. In the future, everyone should maintain a calm attitude and be wary of provocative actions, not to be fooled by them. In addition, various groups belonging to the Popular Front in Clichy held a meeting in the city hall tonight, which was approved by the government authorities beforehand, but only on the condition that the meeting be held inside the city hall. About three thousand people attended the meeting. At that time, some people were in groups on the streets, discussing yesterday's incident, but no other incidents occurred. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

[Paris] The parliamentary delegation of left-wing parties recently convened a meeting in the afternoon regarding the bloody incident in the suburb of Clichy yesterday. It was decided to send a delegation to visit Prime Minister Blum tomorrow morning to state the views of the left-wing parties on this incident. During the meeting, representatives of the Communist Party insisted that the fact that the French Social Studies Party convened a meeting in the working-class area of Clichy yesterday was an intentional provocation. Therefore, they demanded that various fascist-like groups be immediately disbanded. They also believed that the government's recent change in policy, the "suspension of implementation" of various social legislations stipulated in the Popular Front platform, has caused deep unease among the working class. For this reason, the Communist Party demanded that the government continue to implement various social legislations, especially the special grant system for the elderly unemployed, which should be quickly passed. The chairman of the Radical Party parliamentary group, Cambon, repeatedly stated that the party is determined to continue to support the Blum cabinet. However, from the perspective of the Radical Party's theory, freedom of thought and assembly is the primary right of all French citizens, and all parties must be able to enjoy it. The left-wing independent parliamentarian, Perret, said that the government must change its current economic policy, as this policy is too lenient towards the wealthy class and is not in line with the Popular Front's social program. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

[Paris] After the incident in the suburb of Clichy, the Popular Front government will continue to lead the country. Although some quarters say that this incident could cause discord between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, the confrontation between the Radical Socialist Party and the Socialist-Communist Party within the Popular Front is even more serious than the confrontation between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. The Radical Socialist Party has expressed opposition to the proposal for a half-day strike in the Paris area. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party want to investigate the responsibility for the incident. The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper, Le Temps, praised the courage of the police in maintaining law and order, saying, "From the police chief to the investigation team members, all have fulfilled their duties, which is a credit to the republican government and the nation." The Socialist Party's newspaper, Le Populaire, published an article by Blum's confidant, Rosenfeld, which stated, "The responsibility of the police at the time of the incident must be thoroughly investigated. Whether the superiors were too panicked and failed to direct properly, or even allowed their subordinates to act arbitrarily, hoping to alienate the Popular Front government and the working class, should be punished according to the law." The Communist Party's newspaper, L'HumanitÃ©, stated, "The government must punish the criminals, cleanse the various administrative agencies, and also have a way to control those who want to imitate the actions of General Franco in Spain and cause civil unrest in France."

[Paris] Former French Ambassador to Italy, Chambrun, was shot at today at the Gare du Nord by Madame Fountange, one bullet hitting his abdomen. Fortunately, he was not seriously injured and has been taken to the hospital for treatment. The woman, a former journalist, has been arrested. As for the motive, according to the woman's confession at the police station, "He caused me to lose my lover. Everyone knows this woman, there is no need to say it. I confided in him because he was friendly to me and a diplomat who should be able to keep secrets. But he told others about my secrets, so I attacked him to vent my anger." (National dispatch, 17th)

### Serious Situation of Arab-Jewish Conflict Throughout Palestine

Three Bombing Incidents in Jerusalem in One Day; British Authorities Consider Curbing the Unrest

âJerusalem Three bombing incidents occurred here tonight, injuring a total of seventeen people, several of whom were seriously injured. The first incident occurred on a major street at 7:00 PM, when there were many pedestrians, injuring sixteen people, including one policeman and four children. Shortly after, two bombs were thrown into a cafÃ© set up by an Arab on a major street, injuring seven Arabs, two of whom were seriously injured and immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Before long, the third bombing incident occurred. A bomb was also thrown into a cafÃ© opened by Arabs in the suburbs, injuring four people. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

[London] British Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore, in response to questions in the House of Commons today regarding the recent assassinations and riots in Palestine, considered them extremely regrettable. Ormsby-Gore stated that he was satisfied to hear that the Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem and other members of the Arab Higher Committee expressed outrage at the atrocities. However, illegal actions continue to this day. Ormsby-Gore also said that this matter occurred after a long period of unrest last year, so it is extremely difficult to maintain security. He recently consulted with the Palestine Higher Committee on methods to prevent riots. The Higher Committee will arrive in Palestine on Friday, at which time it will discuss emergency measures with the local military authorities. As for whether a state of martial law will be declared, Ormsby-Gore stated that the government is very unwilling to actively engage in it until it is certain that martial law can deal with the matter. When asked whether these acts of violence were directed by a central organization, Ormsby-Gore replied that these matters, regardless of where they come from, are the actions of local groups and are limited in nature, and have no relationship with the Higher Committee.

### British and Japanese Naval Main Battleship Caliber

The Dispute Between 14-inch and 16-inch Will Affect Battleship Tonnage Issues

[London] According to reports, the Japanese government will refuse to accept the main battleship caliber (14 inches) specified in the 1936 London Naval Treaty. Naval sources recently stated that even if this news is true, the United Kingdom does not intend to make any changes to its naval shipbuilding plan from 1936 to 1938. According to the opinion of most experts, a 35,000-ton battleship is suitable for installing 14-inch caliber guns, because the weight of the battleship can be saved, and the armor can be thickened, thereby strengthening the battleship's ability to resist artillery fire. As for 16-inch caliber guns, they can only be installed on 45,000-ton battleships, but the United Kingdom does not intend to build this type of battleship at present. If Japan decides to build battleships of 35,000 tons or more in the future, the British Admiralty may stipulate the construction of 45,000-ton battleships in its naval shipbuilding plan from 1938 to 1939 to respond. In addition, naval sources also said that the attitude adopted by the Japanese government will also have an impact on the Soviet Pacific Fleet. An agreement has been reached in principle between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union on naval negotiations, with the United Kingdom accepting a guarantee clause for the Soviet Pacific Fleet, that is, if Japan does not respect the qualitative restrictions specified in the London Naval Treaty, the Soviet Pacific Fleet will also be free from the restrictions of this measure, but the Soviet Union must immediately notify the United Kingdom in the event of such a situation. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

[London] Regarding Japan's refusal to accept the main battleship caliber (14 inches) specified in the 1936 London Naval Treaty, The Times recently commented that if the main battleship caliber is increased from 14 inches to 16 inches, the impact in the future will inevitably lead to a country using "technical" reasons as an excuse to increase the battleship tonnage to more than 35,000 tons, and thus naval shipbuilding competition will never end. It is known that this competition is not beneficial to any country. If the Japanese government can accept the restriction of the 14-inch caliber before April 1, this situation can be avoided. Otherwise, mankind's most insane behavior will be seen again today. In other words, the next half month is the only opportunity for countries around the world to prevent this action. If it is missed, the naval armaments of countries around the world will be engaged in unrestricted competition, and who should bear the responsibility will be obvious at that time. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the Japanese authorities will make a decisive decision, and that the content of the reply they submit will be better than what is rumored outside. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

[London] Today's news is that the United Kingdom and Germany are currently in the process of concluding a treaty to exchange naval construction plans every year. It is reported that the newly appointed British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, hopes that the treaty can be signed by both parties before taking a detour through New York to Japan. However, the Soviet Union happened to propose holding a European nine-nation naval conference at this time, which led to the delay of the treaty. (National dispatch, 17th)

[Washington] The Navy Department today published a notice inviting private shipyards to bid for the construction of a new battleship approved by Congress. According to preliminary estimates, the cost of this new ship is approximately US$50 million. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### "Female Lindbergh"?? Encircling the Globe by Air

Departing from East to West Yesterday

âOakland American female aviator Mrs. Putnam took off from here at 3:38 PM today, planning to fly around the world via the South Pacific. Mrs. Putnam was flying a Lockheed twin-engine monoplane. At the time of takeoff, it suddenly dropped sharply and almost fell into the cluster of cars near the airport. For a moment, tens of thousands of spectators held their breath and waited. However, it rose steadily not far from the ground and flew towards Honolulu. The weather was not good today, with rain all day long, so it was difficult to determine whether it could take off beforehand. However, it stopped slightly before departure, and the gentle wind blew slowly from the southwest, providing assistance during the ascent. Mrs. Putnam has one technician and two guides on board, carrying 900 gallons of oil. If this flight is successful, it will cover 27,000 miles, creating a record of circumnavigating the globe near the equator. After Mrs. Putnam arrives in Honolulu, she plans to go to Howland Island first, which is one of the stations in the Pacific established by the Commerce Department for the US-Australia air route. From there, she will reach Lae in New Guinea and then to Darwin, Australia. After Mrs. Putnam arrives in Australia, she plans to follow the Australia-England route to India, pass through the interior of Africa to Dakar, and then go to Brazil, north to Florida or Mexico, and return to Oakland. Mrs. Putnam's flight is not for speed, taking about three weeks. Its purpose is to study whether commercial flights around the world can be held, and there is no subsidy. All income is only the postage for the mail sent by philatelists. (National dispatch, 17th)

âOakland American famous female aviator, Ms. Earhart, or Mrs. Putnam, plans to make a feat of flying around the world, and recently departed from here, flying to the first destination, Honolulu. A few minutes before the departure, two commercial aircraft, one "Hawaii Clipper" and one "Pan American Clipper", flew westward via the same route. These three aircraft can have a competition in the Pacific. According to reports, Ms. Earhart has been preparing this flight plan for more than a day. It is from east to west, flying around the earth in a week, and trying to go along the equator. The lady once flew across the Atlantic in 1928, and the lady was the first American woman to fly across the Atlantic, so she has the reputation of "Female Lindbergh". (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### Spanish Government Using Morocco as Bait to England and France

Exchange Aid to Suppress Rebel Army; British and French Governments Decide to Reject

[London] It was learned today that the British and French had previously received a secret document from the Spanish government, requesting British and French aid to the Spanish government to suppress the rebel army, and promising special rights in Spanish Morocco as an exchange condition. After exchanging opinions, the British and French have decided to reject it. According to the opinion of diplomatic experts, this move by the Spanish government is a major diplomatic error and is harmful to the future of the Spanish government army and the rebel army's combat. As for the content of the Spanish proposal, it does not include the cession of land, but only the granting of a special military right, such as allowing British and French troops to pass through, or setting up naval and air force bases. British and French external experts have been ordered to draft a similar reply, stating the reasons for the rejection. (National dispatch, 17th)

### Chamberlain's Remains Cremated Today

British House of Commons Holds Memorial Service; Baldwin and Others Deliver Eulogies

[London] Today, the British House of Commons held a memorial service to commemorate the late great statesman, Austen Chamberlain. Prime Minister Baldwin and others delivered moving eulogies in silence and solemnity. The seat of the former Foreign Secretary was empty, while his brother, Neville Chamberlain, silently sat behind the Speaker's chair, listening to the elegies. Baldwin said that when he first entered Parliament twenty-nine years ago, Austen had introduced him. Although there were differences in political views for a short time after that, their mutual respect never diminished. Baldwin also said that Austen's achievements during his tenure as Foreign Secretary were immortal, and that he was also a great parliamentary scholar whose eloquence was unparalleled in the world. His entire political career was extremely impressive, and his ability to abandon partisan prejudices and promote his frank and selfless spirit in his later years further proved the greatness of his personality. Then, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Attlee, stood up to speak, praising Austen for his efforts to mediate among the great politicians of Europe, hoping to eliminate various difficulties through friendly understanding. He also praised Austen's efforts in the Indian constitutional issue. Liberal Party Member of Parliament Sinclair, representing his party, called Austen a great member of the House of Commons who was able to adhere to his aspirations and beliefs, and whose words were frank and sincere, but forgiving to his political enemies, which was his special feature. Former Prime Minister Lloyd George, Austen's first friend in life, said that Austen's death was a blow to his heart, and that millions mourned him, because they were convinced that the leader who made them deeply admire democratic politics had passed away. In addition, members of various parties who paid tribute to the former Foreign Secretary included Independent Labour Party Member of Parliament Maxton, etc. Austen Chamberlain's remains will be cremated on the 19th and then buried in the St. Margaret's Cemetery in Westminster.

### Important Resolution of the All-India Congress

Continue to Oppose the Constitution

âNew Delhi The All-India National Congress, which has been striving to oppose the Constitution in recent provincial assembly elections, resolved last night that provincial governors not exercising the special powers granted to them by the new Constitution is the only condition for party members to accept government office. This resolution was proposed by the Congress Working Committee and passed by a majority vote. Reuters News Agency learned from well-informed sources in London that the provincial governors of India are unwilling and unable to give Congress leaders any guarantees regarding the exercise of their special powers. If the Congress leaders insist on obtaining concrete guarantees regarding these special powers, it will be difficult to obtain them, and a complete deadlock will ensue. Mahatma Gandhi, who had not been involved in politics for a long time, joined the committee at the beginning of this week, and his compromise proposal was put forward, while Congress Chairman Nehru strongly opposed accepting office. With this new resolution, the Congress's front was maintained without breaking apart. However, it is still unclear whether a provincial government of the Congress faction can be organized, as both sides claim that the new resolution is a victory for their side. The opposition to accepting office believes that the guarantees required by the resolution will be difficult to obtain from the provincial governors, while supporters of accepting office believe that these guarantees are very vague and can be obtained. The Congress has a majority in six of the eleven provincial assemblies: Mumbai, Madras, Central Provinces, United Provinces, Bihar, and Orissa. The Congress is also the largest party in the assemblies of Bengal, Assam, and the Northwest Frontier. The Unity Party, which supports the Constitution, is organizing a government, and its leader, Sir Hayat Khan, is currently doing so. The new Constitution of India stipulates provincial autonomy and grants certain special powers to the provincial governors appointed by the British Emperor. The recent election was the first one held according to the new Constitution. The special powers of the provincial governors are roughly as follows: ã The right to take any action deemed necessary to maintain peace and security, even if advised against by administrative officials; ã Prevention of racial or other discrimination; ã Prevention of discriminatory or punitive treatment of goods imported from the United Kingdom or Burma; ã Protection of the rights of Indian states and protection of the rights and dignity of the rulers of each state.

### Japanese House of Representatives Passes Tax Increase Bill

With Amended Clauses

[Tokyo] Today's general assembly of the House of Representatives opened at 2:39 PM, and the chamber was full due to the submission of the tax increase bill. First, the agenda was changed, and Chairman Masuda reported on the progress and results of the Provisional Tax Increase Law and four related bills in the committee, and explained that the three parties of the Seiyukai, Minseito, and Showakai jointly proposed three amendments and six supplementary resolutions, all of which had been approved. Next, the entire bill was taken as a topic for the second reading, which was immediately discussed.

### Increasing the Burden on the People

Shakai's Chozo Mizutani first opposed in strong terms, launching a harsh attack on the Minister of Finance, saying:

This tax increase bill, whether indirect tax or direct tax, is still borne by the working masses. As for the huge military expenditure, it does nothing but impoverish the people. When should the expansion of national defense expenditure end? We are absolutely opposed to the tax increase that impoverishes the people. If you want to strengthen national defense, you should not increase the burden on the people, but should implement tax increases on capitalists or landowners. The so-called handshake between Finance Minister Yuki and the military is nothing but a handshake between the military and financial capitalists. This tax increase should still be historically denied by the oppressed class.

### Yuki's Consideration is Insufficient

After Mizutani's speech, there was a great applause. Next, Morinaga Takahashi of the Minseito rose and said:

Although Finance Minister Yuki's financial policy is good, I feel that there is insufficient consideration for the political results. Therefore, from this point of view, we have proposed six supplementary resolutions, hoping to pay attention to correcting them.

Hajime Irei (Kokumin Domei) rose and said:

We express our opposition to the amendment to Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Tax Increase Law, and we support the other parts. He read out the items of the National League's hopes, and said that this tax increase plan is based on the capitalist class and does not listen to the calls of the general public and small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists.

Tsuguyo Miyazawa (Minseito) rose and said that the temporary profit tax was originally intended to correct the crippled economy of urban and rural areas, so it should be abolished immediately when it is fundamentally corrected.

### Disturbances by the Minor Faction

Miyazawa then discussed the issues of local grant money, commodity prices, and the increase in national defense expenditure, and continued to speak without stopping. The chamber was quite tired of it, so the voice of "simple" rose frequently. At this point, Miyazawa made an inexplicable statement of support. At that time, Matsunaga moved to advocate stopping the discussion, which was decided because the majority of the Seiyukai and Minseito rose. But the minor faction suddenly caused a major disturbance. Kosaku Maeda (Second) jumped into the seat of the Minseito member and shouted loudly, and was escorted back to his original seat by the chamber guards. At this time, more than 30 members of the minor faction expressed their support and requested a roll-call vote on whether to stop the discussion. As a result of the vote, an absolute majority supported Matsunaga's proposal to stop the discussion, so the motion was passed.

### Final Vote Passed

The Speaker proposed to vote by standing up for or against, and with the support of the Seiyukai, Minseito, Showakai and other factions, the amendment reported by the committee chairman was confirmed and approved. The meeting adjourned at 6:13 PM amid the clamor and angry shouts of the minor faction. (Domei dispatch, 18th)

### New York Mayor Insults Hitler, Hull Apologizes to German Ambassador

States that the United States values freedom of speech, but festering resentment is not beneficial to both countries.

[Washington] The German Ambassador to the United States, Luther, protested again to the U.S. Department of State today because New York Mayor La Guardia made a speech at an anti-German rally, insulting German leader Hitler. Secretary of State Hull immediately replied, expressing his deep apologies again, and stating that the United States has always valued freedom of speech. It is futile to dwell on the past. He only hoped that the people of the United States and Germany would no longer participate in this type of increasingly bitter dispute, but would end it as soon as possible, change the subject, and engage in discussions in a civil manner, which would be beneficial to both countries.

The topics for discussion were roughly divided into: (A) The matter of economic cooperation in North China; (B) The matter of forming common opinions on diplomacy towards China; (C) The matter of forming a separate diplomatic plan for North China; (D) The matter of determining the guidelines for various related aspects in Ji-Dong, Chahar North, and Suiyuan-Mongolia; (E) Instructions for the future work of military attachÃ©s in various regions. The discussion lasted until 8:00 PM, when Tashiro hosted a banquet at his official residence. On the morning of the 17th at 9:00 AM, the conference continued at the same location, with a break at noon. Discussions resumed at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and concluded at 5:00 PM.

From then on, the Japanese side will implement the items that should be promoted in North China according to the resolutions of this conference, with Tashiro and Kita as the core, and proceed in separate ways. Therefore, the nature of this Tianjin Japanese military attachÃ© conference is quite significant. (Morning of the 17th)

### The Grand Gathering in Guihua

Wang and Yan Attend Memorial Service and Military Parade; Officials and Civilians Warmly Welcome Wang and Yan

Guihua Communication: To console the heroic spirits and encourage the living, Suiyuan Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the Jin-Sui Army Suppressing Bandits, Fu Zuoyi, decided to hold a memorial service on the 15th of this month in Guihua for the soldiers and civilians who died in the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War of the previous winter, where the army and the people fought valiantly to recover lost territory and preserve land that had not been lost.

Representatives from the central government, various high-level agencies, and local leaders all arrived in Suiyuan to participate, totaling about two to three hundred people, and arrived in Suiyuan successively starting from the 13th. Central representative Wang Zhaoming and Taiyuan Pacification Director Yan Xishan were originally scheduled to fly to Suiyuan on the afternoon of the 14th, but were delayed until 9:30 AM on the morning of the 15th due to yellow wind. Wang used the public hospital outside New City as his headquarters, while Yan stayed at Fu Zuoyi's residence next to the provincial government. Deng Zhexian, Wang Jingguo, Li Fuying, Wang Lengzhai, and others stayed at the Fengye, Jiaotong, and Baoshang Banks, and the Suiyuan Hotel respectively.

Memorial Service

The memorial service was held at the Martyrs' Park at 12:00 noon on the 15th. The arrangements for the venue were completed on the evening of the previous day.

Outside the shed, a large furnace burned sandalwood, with smoke swirling around, creating a solemn and tragic atmosphere. The participants all wore black gauze on their arms. Soldiers, students, people's militia, and people from all walks of life participated in the memorial service, with no less than fifty to sixty thousand people. At 12:00 noon, Wang and Yan arrived at the venue amidst mournful music. Wang wore a long robe and mandarin jacket, while Yan remained in military uniform. After arriving, they immediately performed the ceremony. Wang was the chief officiant, ascending the chief altar, while Yan stood in the center below the altar. Other military and government officials and visiting representatives stood on the left and right sides inside the shed. The entire assembly stood in solemn silence. After the chief officiant took his place, the entire assembly performed three bows amidst mournful music and thirty cannon salutes. After Wang offered flowers, there was a three-minute moment of silence, followed by the reading of memorial texts from various parties. After performing three more bows, the ceremony concluded amidst mournful music. Then the tomb was opened. At that time, the meeting...

Military Parade

At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 16th, Wang and Yan reviewed the troops at the Suiyuan Racecourse. The main gate of the venue was decorated with a pine branch archway. In the center were the three large red characters "Military Parade Ground," with the eight characters "Unite as One" and "Learn from Shame" in yellow silk on the sides. The review platform was built in the center of the south side of the venue, divided into two levels. The upper level was about five zhang high, with several rattan chairs placed for Wang, Yan, and others to sit on during the review. The lower platform on both sides was for Mongolian princes, local representatives, and participants in the review. It was wrapped in blue, white, and red cloth, and adorned with pine branches. Party and national flags were tied in bundles and inserted around the platform. Red and blue silk banners donated by various parties were hung on the middle, left, and right sides of the platform. The arrangements were simple, elegant, and magnificent. In the center of the platform hung a portrait of the Premier and a large oil painting of Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Around the field, there were fifty wooden pillars with party and national flags hanging on them. The parade commander was originally scheduled to be Zeng Yan Yi, but due to the arrival of Wang and Yan, Zhao Chengzhou, a lieutenant general, was appointed instead. Zhao arrived at the venue in military uniform at 8:00 AM. Wang Jingguo, Li Fuying, Tang Enbo, Zeng Yan Yi, Dong Qiwu, Peng Yubin, Sun Changsheng, and others arrived one after another. The troops to be reviewed arrived in succession before 7:00 AM, including three infantry regiments, one national army regiment, officers and soldiers of the 21st artillery regiment, one regiment of Peng Yubin's troops, two cavalry regiments, and a squadron of armored vehicles, totaling ten vehicles, along with two ambulance vehicles, and 10,000 militiamen from various villages and towns.

At 9:50 AM, Wang, Yan, and Zhao Piliang arrived by car. The military parade began at 10:00 AM. Commander Zhao Chengzhou, riding a horse, reported the number of troops participating in the review. Wang and Yan descended from the review platform and reviewed the troops together in an open convertible horse-drawn carriage. Xiong Bin, Wang Jingguo, Li Fuying, Tang Enbo, Peng Yubin, Sun Changsheng, Hui Yan Yi, and others followed on horseback. After 20 minutes, they completed a round of the field. Wang, Yan, and others returned to the review platform, and the parade began to pass in review. Wang Jingguo and Fu Zuoyi stood on either side of Wang and Yan, explaining everything as they went along. Infantry, artillery, and cavalry advanced in succession, lasting 40 minutes before it was completed. The uniforms and steps of the troops were neat and lively. The cavalry's movements were particularly agile, and the horses were all the same color, which was greatly praised by the audience. The national army wore khaki uniforms. This was the fourth class, only trained for a month, but their spirit was also good. After the parade, the troops gathered separately and lined up in front of the platform to listen to the address. At 11:00 AM, Wang presented memorial medals to the wounded soldiers. The wounded soldiers took their places and stood solemnly in front of the platform, with three representatives receiving the medals on their behalf. After the presentation, the master of ceremonies reported on the deeds of Zhang Yangxian and Zhang Ziqing. Wang also presented memorial medals. Zhang Yangxian was originally a steel armored car driver who made meritorious contributions while wounded during our army's attack on Bailingmiao on November 23 of last year. He has now recovered from his injuries and has been rewarded and promoted three ranks. After the memorial medals were presented, Wang and Yan delivered speeches in succession. Finally, Fu Zuoyi delivered a speech of thanks and encouraged his subordinates. The meeting adjourned at 11:50 AM.

Welcome Rally

At 3:00 PM that afternoon, all sectors of Suiyuan Mongolia and Han held a welcome rally for Wang and Yan at the public hall outside the old city. Two to three thousand people from all sectors attended. The scene was orderly and solemn. Fu Zuoyi presided over the meeting, with Wang and Yan standing on the left side of the platform, and Li Fuying, Wang Jingguo, Zhao Chengzhou, and Tang Enbo standing on the right side. After the ceremony was performed as usual, Fu delivered a welcome speech, briefly stating, "Today, Sui province has this opportunity to welcome Chairman Wang, a national hero, and Director Yan, who is responsible for the Jin-Sui region, in a united effort between Mongolia and Han, which is a great honor. Chairman Wang has endured great hardships and threats for the revolution before reaching today. We greatly admire his character and efforts. Director Yan has worked hard in the local area, especially in benefiting Jin-Sui. Last year, he presided over the War of Resistance and restored our confidence. Therefore, we should take the spirit of the two leaders as our spirit and the actions of the two leaders as our model, especially the Mongolian and Han nationalities in the border provinces, who can, under the leadership of the central government, make the relationship closer and the national defense more consolidated. Therefore, after the welcome rally, infinite hope is born." Next, Wang lectured on the central government's decision to unite sincerely and face national difficulties together, and the process of saving the country from extinction, and finally encouraged everyone with the words "China will achieve freedom and equality, otherwise, China will be the tomb of 400 million compatriots." Next, Yan gave a speech, saying that he would do his best to assist the development of Sui province, promote the sense of responsibility of civil servants, and be determined to preserve the integrity and safety of the land and people of Sui province. When Wang and Yan spoke, the audience stood up every time the Premier, Chairman Lin, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Chairman Wang, and Director Yan were mentioned to pay respect. Wang spoke a total of 14 times, and Wang and Yan bowed to thank the audience each time they paid respect. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

Farewell Banquet

The Sparrow Mansion Orchestra played music in the hall. Mongolian lords, local gentry, and Catholic priests were also invited, totaling more than one hundred people. Wang and Yan arrived around 7:00 PM. During the banquet, Fu first delivered a speech, briefly stating, "Distinguished leaders and guests, this time Suiyuan held a memorial service for the soldiers and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, and you came from afar, which is a great honor for the deceased and an encouragement for the living. Everything has not only been inadequate, but you have also been inconvenienced for a few days. In addition to gratitude, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you good health with vegetarian dishes and light wine." Next, Wang stood up and replied, saying, "Chairman Fu, distinguished leaders, fellow compatriots, you are shouldering heavy responsibilities in Suiyuan, the front line of national defense, and I greatly admire you. This time, I participated in the memorial service yesterday and the military parade today. Everything shows the spirit of military-civilian cooperation. I feel that the future is infinitely bright. In your busy schedules, you did not forget to entertain us, which shows your meticulousness in handling affairs. In addition to gratitude, I would like to borrow the host's wine to wish you all good health." From 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM, the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves in the midst of melodious music and dispersed. (17th)

### Fuzhou Merchants Request Reduction of Business Tax

The tax bureau's newly determined tax amount for merchants is four to five times higher than the merchants' own assessment.

Fuzhou Communication: The Fujian Department of Finance believes that the general business tax in this province is paid by merchants of various guilds based on their own assessments. This is not very accurate as the standard for taxation is based on business volume and capital. A special tax investigation was launched, starting with the provincial capital. The Provincial Capital Tax Special Investigation Office was organized in conjunction with the Provincial Capital Tax Bureau. A large number of investigators were dispatched to shops throughout the city to review accounts and investigate capital and business conditions, and re-determined the tax amount to be paid. Notices were sent to the shops to comply. If the shops believe that the newly determined tax amount is not very accurate, they can submit their accounts to the tax bureau within three days to request correction. However, the tax bureau notices received by the shops recently have been two to three times higher, or even four to five times higher, than the old amount. For example, the gold and silverware industry used to pay 1,560 yuan per year for the entire guild, but now they have to pay more than 30,000 yuan. Those who used to pay ten yuan per month now have to pay more than 390 yuan, which is really unbearable. Trade associations of various industries have been holding meetings for days to discuss how to deal with the situation. Many have sent the notices to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that they be returned to the tax bureau on their behalf, expressing that they cannot recognize them and demanding a re-evaluation. The situation is quite tense. The Minhou County Chamber of Commerce convened a special meeting on the previous day (15th). After representatives of various industries reported on the situation, it was resolved to request the authorities to comply with Article 4 of the "General Guidelines for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces" stipulated by the Ministry, which should not exceed 5/1000 at most, and to abolish all harsh and miscellaneous taxes. The standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Meihui, led more than 30 representatives of various industries to the tax bureau and the Department of Finance to petition, stating their difficulties. Furthermore, with the income tax about to be levied, merchants would be unable to bear the burden if the business tax were to be further increased. It was appropriate that the Director of the Department of Finance, Si Lie, was on leave due to illness, and no results were obtained. On the 16th, the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan, stating that the Fujian Department of Finance's reorganization of the business tax this time, promulgating the revised articles of March 1936, has been increased in intensity. At a time when various harsh taxes have not been abolished, the suffering of merchants is already deep, and it is really difficult to bear the burden. Recently, the Provincial Capital Tax Bureau has been distributing tax notices that exceed the articles stipulated by the Ministry by many times. If this is not resolved and improved, all merchants will inevitably go bankrupt. Now, the merchants are in a state of panic and vow not to recognize them. They implore that Chairman Chen be ordered to order the Fujian Department of Finance to collect taxes in accordance with the Ministry's regulations in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties, etc. At the same time, they also telegraphed the fellow-provincial associations in Beijing and Shanghai, requesting them to appeal to Chen Yi, the chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government staying in Shanghai, to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and quickly order the taxes to be collected as before. (March 17th)

### Suzhou

The Kailuan Mining Company Robbed

The Kailuan Coal Mine branch company near the train station outside Pingmen was robbed by four bandits at 7:00 PM on the 17th. The company's tea boy climbed over the back wall to report to the station's military police. Military Police Company Commander Deng immediately dispatched seven military policemen to pursue and apprehend them. However, upon reaching the destination, the bandits were just breaking out of the struggle. Seeing the military police arrive, they immediately opened fire and swept the area. Military Policeman Wu Peng was immediately killed by a bullet. Military Policeman Shi Youmin was seriously injured in the lower abdomen by a bullet and was sent to the hospital for treatment. One bandit, Bao Xin, was captured on the spot and sent to the regimental headquarters for interrogation that night. After this case occurred, people in Suzhou were impressed by the brave sacrifice of the military police, which is commendable and encourages future generations. A memorial service is planned in the coming days, and it is planned to bury the deceased military policeman in Suzhou and erect a monument to commemorate him.

### Wuxi

Discussion on Land Price Estimation

After handling the urban land price declaration, the Wuxi Land Administration Bureau is currently handling land registration. The Provincial Land Administration Bureau specially sent specialist Ma Yulin to Wuxi last month to estimate land prices. After arriving in Wuxi, Ma went to various places inside and outside the city to inspect and convened town leaders in the urban area for talks. He then used the prosperity and decline of the commercial districts as the standard for the height of land prices. As a result, the highest estimate was more than 15,000 yuan per mu, and the lowest was more than 1,000 yuan. After the land price estimation committee has discussed it once, it will be submitted to the province to prepare for the levy of taxes. The Wuxi Shanghai Fellow-Provincial Association believes that according to Article 6 of the "Rules for the Collection of Land Price Tax in Various Counties and Cities Revised in Jiangsu Province," regarding the regulations on land price tax rates, if the land price is high, the estimated price is already high and the tax is heavy. If the land price is low, the tax rate is high and the tax is even heavier. Compared to the original land price tax of 9 jiao and 6 fen and 6 li per mu, it has suddenly increased to 100 times or more than 60 times. The financial capacity of the people is limited. How can they bear the burden? Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, urging them to pay special attention to this comprehensive tax rate reform. After receiving the telegram, the Chamber of Commerce forwarded it to local public legal groups and scheduled a meeting of local gentry on the afternoon of the 20th of this month to discuss it.

Enthusiastic Ordering of Spring Silkworm Seeds

This spring silkworm season, due to the good harvest last year and the revival of the rural economy, and the recent rise in silk prices, farmers have shown an exceptionally strong interest in silkworm rearing and are ordering silkworm seeds in large numbers. According to statistics from the Silkworm Model Zone, approximately 3,000 sheets are ordered per day. In the past half month, including previous reservations, a total of more than 10,000 sheets have been ordered. The sales volume this year is expected to break all previous records. In addition to sending personnel to the countryside to provide guidance, the zone also conducts training classes for silkworm farmers. Technology Director Zhou Dao also went to the Qianzhou Town area of the 9th district on the morning of the 17th to provide guidance and promote all work. It is also reported that the province has issued 10,000 mulberry seedlings for planting in this county, which will be received by the Qianqiao Silkworm Experiment Field and allocated to the Anzhen Cooperative for planting.

### Changshu

Meningitis Found in the City

The weather was not very cold last winter, and the climate has not returned to normal in the spring. As a result, epidemics have occurred in Xicheng and other counties, and the epidemic has now spread to this county. A woman surnamed Mou suddenly died outside the South Gate the other day. According to the doctor's diagnosis, it was meningitis. It is spreading extremely quickly. There have already been several deaths near the Southeast Gate that were rumored to be caused by infection. Furthermore, according to general speculation, because the main road in the first urban expansion area is currently being widened, the ditches along the road are being excavated. The accumulated filth in the ditches evaporates after being exposed to the sun, causing this epidemic. The authorities are taking measures to prevent it.

### Changzhou

Robbery Occurs on Bo'ai Road

Zhou Mouliang, a resident of the middle section of Bo'ai Road outside Wu Yi Bo'ai Gate, is currently employed by Sassoon & Co. in Shanghai, leaving only his wife, Zhou Liangjin, at home to take care of the house, and renting the remaining rooms to Zuo Qingying. At around 1:00 AM on the 17th, six or seven bandits suddenly entered by digging a hole in the back wall. They tied up Zhou Liangjin and looted at will, leaving nothing of value. Zuo Qingying, who lived with her, was also affected. After about two hours, they left through the front door with their loot. Upon inspection after the incident, the total loss for both families was six to seven hundred yuan. By the time the police were notified to investigate, the bandits had already fled far away.

### Zhenjiang

Large Sum of Money Robbed from Qianzhuang

Dacheng Qianzhuang, located at the intersection of Tianzhu Street and Dongwu Street in Zhenjiang, was opened by Guo Yuzhang, a local. It has been in operation for 17 years. The business was quite prosperous at first, but the business has gradually declined due to the market. However, at around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, just as the partners were opening the door for business, four bandits suddenly arrived. One person was outside acting as a lookout. The other three, wearing blue robes, two holding box guns and one holding a Browning, speaking in a Shanxi accent, one in a Zhejiang accent, and carrying a bamboo basket, rushed in and ordered everyone in the qianzhuang to be quiet and drove them into a small room in the back. Then, the bandit with the Shanxi accent demanded the key to the silver box from Feng Xiangren, the teller of the qianzhuang. Seeing the bandit pointing a gun at him, Feng did not dare to refuse and handed over the key. The bandits opened the silver box and completely robbed more than 3,900 yuan in jiao notes stored in the box, storing them in the bamboo basket. They called the lookout and left through the door. The owner of the qianzhuang then reported the incident to the police. The police chief personally came to investigate and ordered a strict arrest.

### Ningbo

Over Ten Thousand Catties of Stored Grain Stolen

In the Jiqing Township of Yin County, there is a township granary built within the township office, storing grain accumulated over the years, amounting to a considerable quantity. The township clerk, who usually resided there, recently took leave to go to Ningbo due to his wife giving birth there. As a result, the premises were unoccupied at night. On the night of the fourteenth, a large group of thieves scaled the wall and entered, prying open the lock of the township office door, as well as the granary boards on both the left and right sides. They stole over 16,000 catties of stored grain from the two granaries on the right. The door of the left granary was also pried open, but the grain was not stolen. This incident was discovered in the morning by a passerby, who reported it to the township head. A deputy was dispatched by the county to investigate, but no leads have been found yet.

Education News

### Statistics on Education Expenditures of Various Provinces and Cities Across the Country for the 23rd Year

The Ministry of Education recently compiled statistics comparing the education expenditures of various provinces and cities across the country for the 23rd year. The main points are recorded below:

â²Central Education and Culture Expenditures: In the 23rd year, the central education and culture expenditures amounted to 33,819,365 yuan, education subsidies amounted to 9,229,172 yuan, and the expenditures on education organized by other central ministries and commissions amounted to 2,793,260 yuan.

â²Education Expenditures of Various Provinces and Cities: In the 23rd year, the ârevenueâ for education expenditures in various provinces and cities totaled 36,856,444 yuan, and the âexpendituresâ totaled 36,971,544 yuan. Among these, 5,463,882 yuan was âallocatedâ to primary education, 16,995,117 yuan to secondary education, 7,159,072 yuan to higher education, 2,358,686 yuan to social education, 3,066,484 yuan to various project expenses and subsidies, and 1,928,303 yuan to educational administration. The âsourcesâ of revenue for education expenditures in various provinces and cities included 25,168,483 yuan from provincial and municipal treasuries, 2,823,342 yuan from land taxes and their surcharges, 1,785,482 yuan from slaughter and brokerage taxes, 3,992,021 yuan from deed taxes, business taxes, and miscellaneous tax revenues, 2,094,634 yuan from fund and academic property rents, 506,299 yuan from tuition and lodging fees, 205,684 yuan from local administrative revenues, and 280,499 yuan from other income and temporary allocations. The âallocation of higher education expendituresâ in various provinces and cities was 904,558 yuan for specialized schools, 4,471,610 yuan for universities or independent colleges, 129,928 yuan for other academic institutions, and 1,652,976 yuan for overseas studies. The âallocation of secondary education expendituresâ was 6,548,497 yuan for junior middle schools, 2,018,892 yuan for senior middle schools, 4,048,657 yuan for normal schools, 931,599 yuan for short-term normal courses, 2,267,603 yuan for junior vocational schools, and 1,179,886 yuan for senior vocational schools. The âallocation of primary education expendituresâ was 360,349 yuan for kindergartens, 3,591,274 yuan for junior primary schools, and 1,512,259 yuan for senior primary schools. The âallocation of social education expendituresâ was 70,786 yuan for social education talent training institutions, 1,847,776 yuan for general social education institutions, 317,849 yuan for school-style social education institutions, and 122,275 yuan for other professional fees and subsidies. The average expenditure on education per person was 13 cents.

(Explanation) ã In the 22nd and 23rd years, the provinces with education expenditures exceeding 4 million yuan were Jiangsu and Guangdong. Provinces exceeding 3 million yuan were Hebei and Shandong. Provinces exceeding 2 million yuan were Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Guangxi, and Henan. Provinces and cities exceeding 1 million yuan were Shanxi, Peiping, and Beijing. Qingdao's expenditures were approximately 7-800,000 yuan. Guizhou and Suiyuan provinces each had approximately 3-400,000 yuan. Weihaiwei had over 100,000 yuan, and Qinghai had only over 99,000 yuan. As for the percentage of education expenditures to the total estimated expenditures of each province and city, the urban area with the highest percentage was Weihaiwei, with 29% in the 22nd year and 43% in the 23rd year. Nanjing had the lowest percentage in the 22nd year, at 8%. Among the provinces and cities, Anhui ranked first with 24%, followed by Jiangsu, Suiyuan, Henan, Guangxi, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, Jiangxi, etc., all between 10% and 20%. The rest were all below 10%, with Qinghai having the lowest, at approximately 5%.

ã Among the provinces, counties, and cities, Jiangsu had the highest education expenditures, approximately 10 million yuan, followed by Shandong and Henan, at approximately 4-5 million yuan. Suiyuan had the lowest, at over 200,000 yuan. Regarding the percentage of education expenditures to the total expenditures, Chahar had an exceptionally high percentage, estimated at over 60%. Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu all accounted for approximately 30-40%. Suiyuan accounted for 27-28%, and Jiangxi, which was only 16% in the 22nd year, increased to 24% in the 23rd year. According to the draft constitution announced by the National Government, the minimum central education expenditure should be 15% of the total budget (only 4.68% in the 23rd year), and the provinces, regions, counties, and cities should be 30%. It seems that the difference between the provinces, regions and the actual is still large, and the central government needs to increase it urgently. ã The sources of education expenditures in various provinces and cities mostly come from the unified revenue and expenditure of provincial and municipal treasuries. The only ones with designated education funds are Jiangsu's land tax and slaughter and brokerage taxes, which can generate over 4 million yuan annually; Zhejiang's packaging and business tax and tobacco and alcohol surcharges (although still paid by the provincial treasury irregularly); Jiangxi's annual allocation of 2 million yuan from the salt tax fund; Guizhou's annual slaughter tax revenue of over 300,000 yuan; and Henan's annual deed tax revenue of over 2 million yuan. Other provinces and cities are all under the unified planning and allocation of the provincial treasury, or rely on central government subsidies.

ã In the county and city parts, except for Guangxi, which is unified revenue and expenditure by the county government, most other provinces rely on land tax revenue as the main source. Henan Province has a significant amount of deed tax and miscellaneous donations, and Fujian Province also has a large income from education surcharges. The expenses for village schools in Shandong and Chahar provinces are raised locally, accounting for a considerable amount.

ã The average percentage of the entire education expenditure is highest for secondary education, accounting for 40-50%. Higher education accounts for 19%, primary education accounts for 13-14%, social education accounts for 6.38%, project and reserve funds account for 8%, and educational administration accounts for the lowest, at 5%. In the county and city parts, primary education accounts for the highest, at 65%, secondary education accounts for around 10%, social education accounts for 8-9%, project expenses decreased to 9% in the 23rd year, and educational administration accounts for between 7 and 8%.

ã On average, the higher education expenditures of various provinces and cities are mostly spent on universities and independent colleges (62.46%), followed by overseas studies (23.09%), specialized schools account for about 12-13%, and other academic institutions account for only about 1%. Secondary education expenditures are mostly spent on senior high schools, accounting for over 50%, normal schools account for about 30%, and vocational schools account for 20%, which is far from the Ministry's standard of 35%. In primary education expenditures, junior primary schools account for 65-66%, senior primary schools account for 28-29%, and kindergartens account for 5-6%. In social education expenditures, general social education institutions account for the most, at over 70%, followed by social education talent training institutions, and then school-style social education institutions, with other professional subsidies accounting for the least, at about 4-5%. ã Secondary education expenditures in various provinces, counties, and cities are still mostly spent on junior and senior high schools, accounting for 50%, normal schools account for 40%, and vocational schools only get 10%. Primary education expenditures are spent mostly on junior primary schools, accounting for about 70%, senior primary schools account for about 30%, and kindergartens are very few, less than 1%. Social education expenditures are also spent mostly on general social education institutions, accounting for 78-79%, school-style social education institutions account for 20%, and social education personnel training institutions are just over 1%.

ã Guangdong Province had the largest increase in education expenditures compared to the 22nd year, with an increase of about 22%, and Xikang increased by about +11%. Among the cities, Nanjing had a sharp increase of 76%, and Weihaiwei increased by 32%, which were the most significant. Other provinces and cities also had increases to varying degrees, but Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi had reductions. In the county and city parts, Shandong and Jiangxi both increased by 25%, Guangxi increased by 18%, and Suiyuan increased by 2%. Henan decreased by 1%, Chahar decreased by 6%, and Jiangsu decreased sharply by 17%.

ã Regarding the average expenditure on education at all levels per person, the cities bear a heavier burden. Beijing is 2 yuan 35 cents, Qingdao is also close to 2 yuan, and Beiping and Weihaiwei are both between 7 and 8 jiao. Among the provinces, Guangxi bears 2 jiao, which is relatively high. Most provinces are several cents of 1 jiao, with Guizhou having the lowest, at only 6 fen. In the county and city parts, Jiangsu, Guangxi, and Chahar each bear more than 2 jiao, while Shandong, Hebei, and Suiyuan bear about 1 jiao 4-5 fen. The overall average for all provinces and cities is 1 jiao 3 fen.

### Diagnostic Test of Engineering Ability of Zhongda Students

Conducted by the Educational Experiment Institute of Zhongda

In recent years, China's construction industry has become increasingly developed, and there is an urgent need for engineering talents. Young people with aspirations flock to it. Dr. Xiao Xiaorong, professor guiding the Educational Experiment Institute of the College of Education of Zhongda, noted that most high school students in our country strive to enter the engineering departments of universities, but many are eliminated either because they do not meet the physical and intellectual requirements, or during the entrance examination, or they change their majors midway after entering the university, or they have difficulty achieving success after graduation, which has a profound impact on vocational education. Therefore, he developed several engineering ability diagnostic tests to determine whether high school seniors and university freshmen have the qualifications to receive engineering education, so as to avoid wasting time, energy, and money. It is reported that he is now guiding graduate student Wu Jianglin to carry out this work. In addition to testing in major middle schools in Nanjing, Wu will also go to Shanghai and Hangzhou on the 14th of this month to conduct tests. It is expected that about 1,000 university engineering students and middle school students can be tested.

### National Art Exhibition

More Valuable Exhibits Arrive

The preparatory committee for the National Art Exhibition has recently received 8-9,000 exhibits sent by various parties. The National Peiping Library has also sent dozens of valuable exhibits from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, as well as manuscripts and ancient books by famous people, and ten kinds of Dunhuang manuscripts, including copies by famous people from the Jin, Wei, and Tang dynasties, which are rarely seen outside. At that time, people will be able to feast their eyes on them. Chen Danian, a collector from Guangdong, has over 1,000 kinds of ancient jade. In addition, Wen Youju painted a hand scroll of the scenery along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, one foot high and 530 feet long. Introduced by the Guangdong Education Department, he is willing to send it to the exhibition. However, he stated that the exhibition should prepare 40 large eight-immortal tables for display. The preparatory committee believed that the hand scroll required 40 large eight-immortal tables to be displayed, which would occupy one-third of the entire area of the venue. Due to the limitations of the site, it was really impossible to receive and display it. It has replied with a letter expressing regret.

(Nanjing, 18th) The organizing committee of the National Art Exhibition has decided to form an editorial committee and has hired 20 experts as members, with Teng Gu as the director. Their task is to write papers, disseminate knowledge related to the exhibits, guide criticism, and enhance social artistic taste. The association has also decided that the price of each admission ticket is 2 jiao, and half price for military, police, and students.

### Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Actively Promoting Compulsory Education

â²Adding Short-Term Primary Schools and Expanding Enrollment This Semester

â²Ordering Compulsory Enrollment Measures, Violators to Be Punished

Since the establishment of the Compulsory Education Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has been actively promoting compulsory education with all its might. The committee held its ninth regular meeting the other day, passed the implementation of the Compulsory Enrollment Law and various plans, and Xue Wei, an official of the bureau, broadcast a report on the current situation of compulsory education on the municipal radio station yesterday afternoon at 4:30. The details are as follows:

â²Adding Short-Term Primary Schools This semester, a total of 19 short-term primary schools, 1 ordinary primary school, 1 two-part grade, and 2 mobile education classes will be added. In total, 44 short-term primary schools with 104 classes were established in the 25th year, accommodating 5,720 students. There were 107 short-term primary school classes in the first semester and 91 classes in the second semester, accommodating 5,885 students. In the first semester, 5 ordinary primary schools (1 two-part grade) were added, and 1 school was added in the first semester. A total of 58 grades were added in the first semester and 11 grades in the first semester, accommodating a total of 3,500 students. Two-part systems total 30 grades, accommodating 3,000 students. There are 5 mobile education classes, accommodating 275 students. This year, a total of 18,380 students were enrolled. In order to increase the effectiveness of teaching, the Social Affairs Bureau also provided short-term training to all principals, teachers, and teaching assistants during the winter vacation, and they have now been assigned to work.

â²School-Age Children in the City The Social Affairs Bureau's survey of school-age children in the city has now been completed (excluding the special zone). A total of 53,763 school-age children in the city have been enrolled, 36,630 have not been enrolled, 606 have deferred enrollment, and 281 are exempt, totaling 108,115. Among them, the Yuejie Building Road has not been surveyed, and the primary school district of Zhongbishi Primary School in Yinhang District, Lukge Primary School, has not been surveyed. In total, since most of the students enrolled are over 12 years old and under 6 years old, and there are many students coming from the Kunlian Concession and various counties in Kunlian and Zou provinces, the number of children in the city is only over 108,000, which does not seem correct. The bureau has ordered districts with errors to report. In addition, the French Concession has not yet been contacted, and the Public Concession's 1935 survey by the Chinese Education Office shows that there are 9,066 in the central district, 18,973 in the northern district, 61,001 in the eastern district, and 49,502 in the western district, totaling 149,542. However, their ages range from 5 to 15 years old, which differs from the Ministry of Education's survey of those aged 6 to 11.

â²Implementing Compulsory Enrollment The Social Affairs Bureau has stipulated measures for implementing compulsory education and compulsory enrollment. For children who have reached school age and should be enrolled but are not, the following penalties should be imposed on their parents or guardians: ã Written warning: For those who should be enrolled but have not been enrolled for more than ten days after the start of school, the principal of the local primary school or the director of the short-term primary school will issue a written notice, advising their parents or guardians to enroll them within five days after the notice. ã Posting names: If the children are still not enrolled within the time limit after being advised, the principal of the school will post their names to serve as a warning and order them to enroll their children within five days of the posting. ã Fines: Those who still do not comply after the name posting and warning may be fined from half a yuan to two yuan within five days after the warning limit and ordered to enroll. ã Service: Those who are unable to pay the fine may be required to perform service and are still ordered to enroll.

### Chinese Basketball Team Going to Beijing This Morning

Two Games Against Central Military Academy Tomorrow and the Day After

The Chinese basketball team, which gathers the essence of Shanghai, failed to win the international championship this year, but its talents and skills are indeed superior to those of the past few years. For example, in the final battle against the United States, it had a 38-minute advantage. Although the final victory was still won by the Americans, the beauty of the performance at that time was truly worthy of praise. In order to observe the skills, a group of thirteen people took a fast train to Beijing at 8:30 this morning to play two friendly matches with the Central Military Academy basketball team, which dominates the capital. The order is as follows: ã Chinese vs. Military Academy: 4:00 pm on the 20th at the Amateur Court. ã Chinese vs. Military Academy: 3:00 pm on the 21st at the Amateur Court. The full team list is as follows: Coach: Li Xianjun, Manager: Shen Kunnan, Players: Wang Nanzhen (Captain), Feng Nianhua, Chen Xianglong, Kuang Yaoya, Zhou Dayun, Cai Yanxiong, Yin Guiren, Weng Renan, Chen Zongqi, Han Zhenyuan, Li Zude.

### Austrian Defeat Boosts South China's Hopes

Li Huitang Scores a Hat-Trick, Defeating Wireless; Bao Jiaping's Goalkeeping Also Crucial

(Hong Kong Dispatch) On Sunday the 14th, in the First Division of the Ordinary Cup Football Tournament, South China, relying on Li Huitang's three goals, surprisingly defeated the strong Wireless team by three goals, overcoming this difficult hurdle. The day before, Western defeated Austrian 4-2, greatly assisting South China. Thus, South China's record is equal to Austrian's, with only one game less. From now on, the future is bright, and there are no more obstacles in the remaining games. It seems the dream of winning three consecutive championships will definitely be realized. The current situation of the top four teams is listed below:

The number of spectators that day was particularly large. The stands in So Kon Po were full. Both sides regarded the match as facing a strong enemy and spared no effort. Tan Jiangbai of South China was absent, but Ye Beihua, who had been absent for a long time, suddenly reappeared as left winger. Zheng Jiliang retreated to fill the left back position. Weighing the strength of the teams, South China was indeed a step ahead. After the start of the match, the difference was immediately apparent. Li Huitang's shooting skills greatly intimidated the opponents. As expected, within twelve minutes, he scored the first goal. Wireless then got a penalty kick, but it was blocked by Bao Jiaping. The first half ended with a score of 1-0. In the second half, Wireless was not in good shape, and their left centre-back, Taylor, was injured and had to leave the field, leaving them with only ten players. They were constantly at a disadvantage. Li Huitang scored two more goals, winning 3-0. Old Bao of South China was cautious and prudent. Zheng Jiliang played left back, partnering with Li Tiansheng, and surprisingly performed well, defending properly. The three centre-backs were a cohesive unit. The forwards Cao, Li, Ye were mediocre, while Li and Feng were the most outstanding. Li used all his skills, dribbling, passing, and shooting, which was amazing. Wireless's formation was chaotic, their coordination scattered. Their attack was brave but lacked strategy, and their defense was indecisive in critical moments. Their defeat was therefore justified.

Li Huitang, National Player, Breaks the Enemy's Defense

Referee Mr. Li Lu blew the whistle to start the match. South China took the offensive first. Li Huitang was elusive, launching rapid attacks. Lawrence welcomed the attack. Soon, South China attacked again. Wan Lian committed a foul. Li Huitang took the free kick, shooting directly at the goal, but Lawrence caught it again. Wireless attacked twice, but to no avail. Li and Feng of South China, assisting each other, gradually pressed towards the enemy's goal, but did not succeed. Wireless switched from defense to attack. Zheng Jiliang bravely blocked Bailey outside the penalty area and was penalized. Evans lofted the ball towards the goal, but Jiaping caught it skillfully. Soon, Sullivan returned, passing the ball to Roberts for a deep shot, but it hit the post and went out of bounds. After twelve minutes of the match, South China was already in good form. Huang Meishun passed the ball from the center, and Li and Feng passed it on briefly. Huitang dribbled and advanced, shooting quickly, opening the scoring. There was a round of applause.

Bao Jiaping, Iron Hands Guard the City

Having conceded a goal, Wireless quickly tried to retaliate. After the restart in the center, within a few rounds, Torbett dribbled and advanced, passing diagonally to the left. Roberts moved forward to receive the pass, returning the ball to the penalty area along the baseline, hitting Meishun's hand. A penalty kick was awarded. Sullivan's kick was not strong, and Jiaping caught it with iron hands, saving the day. The forwards then attacked again. Li and Cao cooperated, forcing a corner kick. Taylor took it, and Jiliang returned it to the original spot. Huitang received the ball and took a long shot, the ball flying like an arrow, but unfortunately, it went wide. Wireless counterattacked, Sullivan shot from close range, and Taylor lobbed from afar, but both were collected by Jiaping. Torbett then charged up, passing to Sullivan for a diagonal shot from close range. Jiaping dived and saved the danger. The enemy soldiers were unwilling to give up. Evans intercepted the ball and passed it to Bailey for a cross. Lawrence responded from the left, shaking his head and heading fiercely, but it went over the bar. The half ended.

Wireless Loses Soldiers and Generals

Changing ends for the second half, the situation was no longer as tense as before. Wan Lian passed the ball to Torbett, who fired a long-range shot, but it went wide. Suddenly, Taylor, due to a collision with Li Zhaorong, fell and injured his hand, leaving the field. From then on, they fought with only ten players. South China often dominated the field. Liang Rongzhao lobbed the ball high, Lawrence caught it and passed it out, Meishun intercepted and sent it forward, Jingxiang slashed diagonally, and Beihua advanced quickly. Evans was forced to concede a corner kick, desperately trying to break out. Beihua was then injured in a brave battle and retired for a short rest. Both sides fought with ten players. Cao Guicheng penetrated the enemy's formation, and Jie Ting forced a corner kick. After Guicheng kicked it out, Bailey countered, passing a dangerous ball, but Rongzhao managed to break through the encirclement. Hui constantly moved back and forth in the enemy's formation. Guicheng forced a corner kick. Evans, outside the back line, did not guard his hand, and Huitang took the free kick, shooting straight at the goal, but it was again caught by Lawrence.

South China Returns Home in Glory

At this time, Beihua returned to the field. Wireless was gradually feeling unsustainable. In the 21st minute, Liang Rongzhao advanced from the back, passing the ball forward. The three forwards passed it five times, breaking through the defense and entering the area. Jie Ting touched the ball with his hand, which was seen by everyone, but was not penalized. Huitang's ambition was aroused, dribbling and passing through the crowd, firing a sharp shot. Clearly and precisely, the ball entered the goal, making it 2-0. Wireless struggled once, forcing a corner kick, but to no avail. Guicheng, who had been waiting for a long time, passed a wonderful ball from the center. Lawrence hit and kicked it, temporarily relieving the pressure. In the 28th minute, Li Tiansheng encountered the enemy, sending the ball forward with a big kick. Cao Guicheng dodged Jie Ting, passing it diagonally along the side to Huitang, who flew forward, Wilmer chasing hard but unable to catch up. Li shot from close range, scoring another great achievement, making it a clean score of 3-0. Wireless had no fighting spirit and could not score a goal. Soon, the match ended.

### Chinese Team to Play Portugal in International Cup Semi-Finals Tomorrow

â² 2:30 PM at Yat Yuen Stadium

This week's football highlight is the International Cup semi-final between China and Portugal on Saturday. This year, domestic teams have achieved very little. The issue of Tung Wah and Loyola's withdrawal from the Scott Cup has not yet been resolved, and the Chinese team has no hope in the First Division. Therefore, this International Cup match must be played with effort in order to win some glory for the Chinese. In addition, there will be two First Division matches: Kiang Nan vs. Lux and Westerners vs. French Merchants. The situation will likely be one-sided, with Lux and French Merchants undoubtedly winning. On Sunday, the most anticipated league match is between Chen Tan and Tsin Tak, with victory likely going to Tsin Tak. Another match will be between French Merchants and Sociedade. Although the French Merchants will be fighting for two days, they should have no problem against the weak Sociedade. The order of matches for the two days is listed as follows:

### Securities

Following the Lead of the Financial Sector

Public Bonds Surge to Prominence

Rising by $1 to $1.35

Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suddenly saw a special surge in the afternoon. All public bonds except Class A reached new highs. After brewing for several weeks, good news appeared and prices rose. As the March term was approaching, this triggered short covering, which further boosted the market. As the reporter predicted, the surge was particularly strong because yarn merchants and gold merchants followed the financial sector and bought in large quantities. The market suddenly became prosperous, and confidence soared. The trend is expected to continue. Yesterday, the market opened with mixed results, with fluctuations of only five cents. The stagnation in the second session was unprecedented. Although various public bonds were opened in turn, none of them, except for the current month's bonds, which were slightly down by five cents, showed any fluctuations. In the afternoon, numbers 10, 14, 34, and 77 suddenly saw buying, which quickly changed market sentiment and prices rose slowly. Class B forward bonds suddenly rose by as much as 65 cents, and the market became lively. At the close, numbers 10 and 35 continued to see buying, which again triggered short covering. Class D soared by $1.15, and the rest also rose by several cents to about $1. The result was that the current month's Class E rose by 65 cents, and the current month's Class A rose by 80 cents, the least. The rest all rose by $1 to $1.35. The total transaction volume was $8.33 million. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

### Yarn

Sichuan Sales Surge Again, Yarn Prices Soar

Shorts Suffer and Cover at a Loss

Market Advances Steadily

The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend intensified. This was because spring sales developed, and merchants rushed to purchase. Sichuan merchants bought even more aggressively, and Tianjin, inland, and Changsha merchants also searched for supplies. At the same time, the atmosphere of good news was strong, shaking confidence. Shorts, seeing the unfavorable environment, had to cover at a loss, and the market advanced steadily. All months broke through the $240 mark, reaching new peaks in recent times.

Standard Yarn Rises by $3.8

In the opening session of the standard yarn market, all months saw slight increases, but US cotton and grade three cotton both fell. However, local sentiment turned firm and bullish, and shorts took the opportunity to cover when foreign cotton fell slightly. As a result, the market rebounded from weakness, and each month jumped by $1.78 to $2. The forward months all broke through the $40 mark. By the close, it was reported that spot yarn transactions were less than before, with 1,300 bales sold, and prices rose by $1-2. The close was slightly lower. The result of the standard yarn was that each month rose by $1.7-9 to $2.1 compared to the previous day's close. The market was even stronger in the afternoon session. Due to good news about spot yarn, shorts rushed to cover, and the market became tighter. The forward months rose even more strongly. By the close, there was a further advance. It was reported that the spot yarn business was more than 4,000 bales. The results of the standard yarn were that each month rose by another $1.3, 4, and 5 compared to the morning session's close. It was found that 1,000 bales of Jifeng, 1,750 bales of Mingde, 8,050 bales of Gengfeng, 1,050 bales of Changyu, 1,350 bales of Shenji, 1,000 bales of Renfeng, 2,000 bales of Yicheng, 4,400 bales of Changfeng, 2,950 bales of Xiecheng, 1,400 bales of Hengchang, 1,100 bales of Changji, 1,100 bales of Ruid, 1,050 bales of Wang Taixing, 3,950 bales of Taichang, 1,250 bales of Dachang, and 1,400 bales of Tonghe were sold. 3,450 bales of Dafu, 2,550 bales of Hengyi, 2,550 bales of Jinchang, 1,750 bales of Zhenda, 4,600 bales of Hexing, 1,700 bales of Tongfeng, 2,800 bales of Fengtai, 3,900 bales of Dachangcheng, 4,450 bales of Dachang, 5,100 bales of Yuda, and 1,550 bales of Runkang were bought. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

Yarn Sales Exceed 4,000 Bales

Spot yarn sales remained active. Statistics show that merchants bought a total of 4,269 bales throughout the day. The selling prices were: yuan/bale, yuan/bale. The amount of purchases by each merchant is listed below.

Han Cotton Can Be Delivered, Cotton Prices Not as High as Yarn Prices

The cotton market continued to rise and the momentum was strong. This was because US cotton had been soaring for days, and Shanghai market had not yet risen enough. Yesterday, US cotton slightly retraced, and general speculators took the opportunity to cover, resulting in a dry market and a rebound in prices. However, according to some, this month's Shashi cotton and Hankou cotton can both be delivered, so the market slightly retreated at the afternoon close.

Standard Cotton Sees Both Short Covering and Profit Taking

In the opening session of the standard cotton market, all months saw increases, but US cotton fell while Indian cotton continued to rise. Shorts took advantage of the US cotton decline to cover, resulting in a tighter market. At the same time, the yarn market advanced, making the market even stronger, rising step by step. The result of the standard cotton was that each month rose by 3, 4, and 5 cents compared to the previous day's close. The market remained firm in the afternoon session, following the yarn market, but the momentum was not as strong as the yarn market. This was because profit-takers sold out, and the forward months had already risen above the $6 mark. The result of the standard cotton was that each month fell by 5 cents to 1.5 cents compared to the morning session's close. It was found that 4,200 dan of Jifeng, 4,200 dan of Dafeng, 5,500 dan of Changji, 3,300 dan of Shenchang, 14,300 dan of Taichang, 5,500 dan of Yichang, 3,400 dan of Runkang, 10,400 dan of Dachang, 6,300 dan of Shengyuan, 6,300 dan of Xinchang, 2,800 dan of Yuan, and 2,100 dan of Fukang were sold. 7,400 dan of Hengyi, 2,600 dan of Dafu, 8,800 dan of Yuda, 11,700 dan of Jinchang, 4,400 dan of Zhenda, 3,000 dan of Ruid, 3,400 dan of Senkang, 3,100 dan of Tongfeng, 7,000 dan of Dachangcheng, 3,300 dan of Xincheng, 4,400 dan of Wang Taixing, and 2,100 dan of Yuanxingchang were bought. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

Japanese Factories Increasingly Interested in Importing Cotton

Spot cotton consumption is still decent, and Japanese factories are buying more actively. There are no reports of sources.

US Cotton Sees Large-Scale Profit Taking

Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with mixed results. Each month varied from a drop of 3 points to a rise of 4 points. In the early morning, industry peers, Wall Street, and foreign merchants bought in. The forward months were particularly firm due to strong cloth sales. As the March term was ending today, long positions were closed out, resulting in relatively weak performance. This caused the price gap between the May and October terms to narrow. Spot cotton was firm. Later, industry peers and shorts bought in, and the market recovered slightly. However, large-scale profit taking and sales from New Orleans caused prices to weaken again. The closing was flat, with spot prices falling by 12 points and futures falling by 12 points to rising by 1 point. British cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures rose by 8 to 10 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to purchases by futures traders and European exporters, but weakened due to large-scale profit taking. Ultimately, various goods and stocks were strong, and shorts and the public bought in, causing prices to rise again. The final results were: Pingguo rose by 0.75 rupee, Aomla rose by 3.5 to 4.25 rupees, and Bairokh rose by 4 to 4.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 17th).

According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 18th is: Bairokh at 252 rupees, Aomla at 238.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees, and Pingguo at 199.75 rupees, down 0.25 rupees.

### Grains

Longs Accumulating, Forward Flour Particularly Strong

Yesterday's flour market saw firmness after the opening of the morning session. This was because the prices of foreign wheat in Chicago continued to be good, ranging from 245 cents, and in Canada, around 68 cents, and in Liverpool, up 2 pence. When prices opened, foreign wheat had risen for three or four days in a row, and this momentum was significant. However, as the near term was approaching settlement, the accumulated flour in this and other regions had very little real sales. In the midst of this surplus, confidence remained difficult to boost. The opening prices for March and April were only slightly better by one or two cents. Afterwards, both longs and shorts closed out in large quantities, and the market stabilized. June and July, on the other hand, saw good sentiment due to the high prices of foreign wheat, and rose by three or four cents. By the afternoon opening, both sides continued to close out March and April positions, and new trading was extremely sluggish. As a result, they only rose by two or three cents. July and August, on the other hand, saw long accumulation, and continuous cold and rainy weather made sentiment continue to be good for one or two cents. Based on the current situation, if there is no real sales support in the near term, the near and forward months may separate again.

Tianjin Merchants Dump, This Month's Wheat Plunges by 2.2 Cents

Forward New Wheat Unique in Spring Competition

Yesterday's wheat market saw the following: After the opening of the morning session, each month's market price rose by three, four, and five cents compared to the previous day due to the continuous rise in foreign wheat prices and the unfavorable weather. However, trading was sluggish, creating a stalemate. By the afternoon opening session, March and April were initially stable, but the Tianjin merchants' long positions in this month were sold off smoothly, causing sentiment to suddenly turn unfavorable and prices to plunge sharply. At the close, it was as low as $6.21. The price of April also fell by six cents compared to the initial opening price. June and later months had better sentiment due to the weather and foreign wheat, rebounding by three or four cents compared to the morning session. Spot wheat saw very few transactions, but the rain caused the price to improve slightly. The opening price for Jiangbei wheat was $6.37, and for Chongming wheat, $6.18, with only four or five hundred bags opened.

Puli Factory Soybean Cake Sold 8,000 Pieces

Tested by Shantou Merchants Yesterday

Soybean Sales Yard Continues to Be Quiet

Yesterday, Changzhou Puli Factory's four-brand soybean cake (Fat Brand) was inquired about by Shantou merchants, and 8,000 pieces were tested. Delivery was scheduled for the second half of March at a price of $2.08. Because it was the first time the price was opened, for the sake of courtesy, it was slightly more favorable compared to the prices of other factories. In addition, there were peddlers who wanted to trade, with a total transaction of 25,000 pieces of Dafu Factory's four-brand cake, including 1,000 pieces of spot goods at a price of $2.10, 13,000 pieces for April delivery at a price of $2.12, and 11,000 pieces for May delivery at $2.16. The market remained stable and there were no major changes. Soybean sales continued to be quiet, but sellers remained firm, resulting in a stalemate. Yesterday, only two cars of Yingzhou beans, 700 bags of Hankou Zha beans, 300 bags of Jiujiang winter beans, 50 bags of Shashi beans, and 150 bags of Du beans and Shahuang beans were opened.

Oil and Soybean Cake Still Without Honor or Disgrace

Yesterday, the standard oil and soybean cake market still lacked honor or disgrace. Only standard beans were arriving in abundance as spot goods, and actual sales were quiet. Brokerages had standard shorted, and cake and oil sales were also weak. However, the Dalian market was firm, and factories and customers rarely sold short. Therefore, the standard oil market saw little difference between this month and the forward months. The recent four or five months saw a slight improvement of five cents to one cent. Spot standard cake was not strong, and the near month was slightly down by 0.25 cents, while the distant month remained stable. Spot standard beans were dragged down by spot goods by 5 cents, while the forward month was flat, with a difference of 1 cent.

Rainy Weather Boosts Rice Prices

-Customer and Xian Cargo Owners' Thinking Is Also Firm-

(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was over twenty numbers of gangs, a total of five thousand two or three hundred stone of goods, inside which was light rice of eleven or twelve numbers, the sky was overcast and it was rare, and people's hearts and minds were high and tight. The sales in this street were relatively lively, and the sellers' voices were quite high. In the end, the thick japonica rice market rose again by five cents to one jiao, and the light rice Xi'an gang was able to handle nearly two thousand bags, and it also showed a few points. Duyangjian and Yinyuan were all close to the jiao.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday's source was not much, about seventeen or eight numbers, the market's cargo digestion was lively, and customers were tight and detached due to the cloudy and humid temples and the gradual reduction of river accumulation, resulting in tight shouting. The white japonica rice market for high-quality goods rose by one jiao, and the second-rate goods rose by about two jiao. Early rice rose outside the jiao, light rice increased by about one jiao. Yangdu Bujian also added nearly jiao, guest jian and Baiyuan prices also tightened several points, and the remaining various goods prices also increased by several points to one jiao.

(Customer Xian) Yesterday, guest Xian arrival and sales were both prosperous, the Cantonese gang's digestion did not decline, and people's hearts and minds continued to go up. The weather these days is too cold, and there is a lot of cloudy rain, and the spring flowers may not be damaged. The cargo owners' thoughts are turning firm, and it is suitable that the Cantonese sales are continuously being received smoothly, which makes the cargo owners more excited. In the morning, all the rice has been uniformly stepping up three or five points, and the aftermath of the afternoon has not been cut off. Hunan red rice has risen to 10 yuan and 05 cents, and other rice has also stepped up well. The red rice is larger than the day before by one jiao, and the other major ones are not the same as five or six points. The gastric Cantonese gang accounted for 70 or 80% of the total, and this street Shantou Beiyang Xi'an all had a little bit of embellishment. A total of 11,300 bags of Jiangxi rice, 4,550 bags of Xiang rice, 280 bags of Shashi brown rice, and 450 bags of tin brown rice were opened throughout the day.

Overseas Silk Market Is Booming

Yokohama Spot Prices Soar by 35 Yuan

Shanghai Silk Transactions Total 229 Bales

Recently, the overseas silk market has been booming. Silk prices in Japan and the United States have risen significantly, with the recent price in New York reaching 2.08 yuan and the spot price in Yokohama reaching 955 yuan, both of which are the highest in recent years. Yesterday, silk prices in the silk market, including both Nissin and Huasi Silk Products, rose by 0.03 yuan across the board.

Although there were rumors in the market that the recent surge in the silk market was caused by speculators and short covering on the exchange, the daily increase in domestic and foreign silk prices still felt like the beginning of something big. Foreign firms in this port, such as Lianna, Yuanchang, and Yuanfeng, continued to take in new silk. There were transactions in both coarse and fine grades. Foreign firms and local users sold and opened positions with each other, with a total transaction volume of 229 bales.

Shanghai Price Index for February

Has Recovered to Pre-Economic Recession Levels

36% Higher Than the Lowest Period

According to a report by the National Tariff Commission, the Shanghai wholesale price index and cost of living index (Note 1) for February 1937, compared with the previous month, wholesale prices continued to rise, while the cost of living remained unchanged. The total wholesale index was 122.9, an increase of 1.1% compared to the previous month and 16.6% compared to the same month last year, the highest index since December 1931. The impact of the world economic recession on China's prices began in the autumn of 1931. The Shanghai wholesale price index fell from 129.2 in September of that year to 90.5 in July 1935. As prices in various countries rebounded first and China implemented legal tender afterward, this index began to show an upward trend in November 1935. In the past three or four months, it has seen particularly rapid progress. This month's index is almost on par with the index during the economic recession (September 1935). The reason for the increase in this month's index is that it is the beginning of the Lunar New Year, and red markets typically rise, and the price of metals continued to rise sharply. The following is a comparison of the classified indices (Note 2) with the previous month:

Wholesale Classified Index 1. Compared with the previous month, the eight category indices showed a sharp rise in metals, a slight increase in miscellaneous goods and chemicals, and a slight decrease in fuels and building materials. The remaining three categories saw changes of less than 1%. The metal category index was 184.7, an increase of 7.1% compared to the previous month. Steel prices have generally risen sharply, and sales of various products have been quite smooth, so the red market prices have become even higher. The largest price increase was in French nails and white lead wire. The market price of French nails per barrel was 10.50 yuan last month and 13.00 yuan this month, an increase of 24%. The index for this category has been rising steadily since July last year, and the rise has been particularly sharp in the past four months. This month's index is 49% higher than the 123.7 in July last year. The main reason is the sharp increase in international market demand and soaring prices. The miscellaneous category index rose by 3.7% compared to the previous month. Enamel basins saw a price increase of more than 20% due to high raw material costs. Asphalt was selling well in foreign markets. Bran, raw cowhide, rough-edged paper, and newspapers were all in high demand and prices soared. The chemical category index rose by 1.1% due to the rise in alum and indigo oil. The fuel category index fell by 1.9%. Coal prices generally fell due to sluggish sales, and firewood prices also declined. The building materials category index fell by 1.1%. Liu'an boards, teak, and lime all saw weakness.

Wholesale Classified Index 2. Compared with the previous month, the two category indices both saw a slight increase. The raw material index rose by 0.1%. Among the four-month indices for this category, animal products and forestry products rose slightly, while mineral products and agricultural products fell slightly. Animal products rose by 1.3%. Pork and mutton prices rose along with raw cowhide due to high demand during the New Year. Forestry products rose by 0.3%. Asphalt, Douglas fir, and construction pine all saw rising prices. Mineral products fell by 0.4%. Although pig iron and alum both rose, coal prices generally fell, so the index still fell. Agricultural products fell by 0.1%. Suchang rice was active in both local and foreign sales. Jimoto rice prices rose due to demand during the New Year. Wheat also followed the upward trend of foreign markets. However, corn, sorghum, and beans generally fell due to sluggish sales, and tobacco leaves also saw a slight easing in prices as holders were eager to sell. The manufactured goods index rose by 1.5% compared to the previous month. The indices for both items in this category rose across the board. Among them, the producer goods index rose by 2.0%. Cotton yarn prices fell due to sluggish sales, and Japanese yarn prices plummeted. White silk prices fell sharply overseas, and foreign merchants were watching and exports were stagnant. Selling prices fell. According to New York telegraphs, the market price of silk from Shanghai factories was US$1.83 per pound on the 15th of this month, a decrease of more than 10% compared to the US$2.05 in the previous month. However, Jili dry silk saw a price increase due to a shortage of goods. Steel, iron, purple copper, bran, indigo oil, and newspapers also showed the same trend. The consumer goods index rose by 1.1%. Enameled basins, silk, and crepe all saw price increases due to the rise in raw material prices in recent months, which increased costs. Fine serge was being actively purchased in central China. Flour prices continued to rise with wheat prices. Prices for salmon, daylily, black dates, patterned labels, and rough-edged paper also rose. However, soybean oil prices have fallen frequently in recent markets. Fine twill and cotton gabardine saw sluggish sales. Fresh oranges arrived, sales were smooth, and hemp bags and Longkou vermicelli also fell.

Evening Banquet Hosted Jointly by the Chamber of Commerce and Four Other Groups

The first general membership meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association was held yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. One hundred and thirty-one members from both China and Japan attended. The meeting was presided over by the Chairman of the Association, Zhou Zuomin, who delivered a welcoming speech and report. This was followed by a speech by Mr. Kodama, Chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association. Subsequently, two motions, including the completion of organization, were passed. Kodama Kenji and others also went to Zhou Zuomin's residence at 10:00 AM yesterday morning for a preliminary symposium, followed by a luncheon hosted by Zhou. In the evening, they attended a joint banquet hosted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and four other groups, adjourning around 4:00 PM. The details of each event are recorded below:

Symposium at Zhou's Residence: Kodama and others went out to visit friends yesterday morning. Around 10:00 AM, at the invitation of Zhou Zuomin, they went to Zhou's residence on Yuyuan Road for a symposium. Directors of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, Xu Xinliu, Qian Xinzhi, Li Fusun, Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Liu Hongsheng, Lin Kanghou, Yu Zuoting, Zhong Bingfeng, Wu Yunzhai, Yoshida Seiji, Ube Takue, Yamamoto Takeo, and others were also invited to participate. Both sides raised various questions and exchanged opinions in a very cordial discussion. Both sides attached great importance to the organization of the association, hoping to enrich its content and actively carry out various tasks in this favorable atmosphere. Therefore, they drafted two motions, including the completion of organizational preparation, to be submitted to the general meeting for discussion. At noon, Mr. Zhou hosted a special luncheon. After the meal, Kodama and others returned to the International Hotel to rest. At 2:30 PM, they went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to attend the general meeting.

Agenda of the General Meeting: The meeting venue was set in the conference room on the third floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, simply decorated. In the center of the platform hung a portrait of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, flanked by the national flags of China and Japan. To the left of the platform were seats for the Chairman and Directors, and to the right were seats for the recorders. Members' seats were arranged in two rows, with a aisle in the middle leading directly to the platform. The press gallery was located on both sides at the rear of the room. Outside the venue, many police officers were on guard, and access was strictly controlled. After signing in, members were issued a triangular badge with a red ribbon to wear on their lapels. They were then led by ushers to the lounge to rest. At 3:30 PM, the meeting began with the ringing of a bell, and attendees entered the venue in an orderly fashion. Reporters from various newspapers with press passes were admitted upon presentation of their passes. The agenda of the general meeting was as follows: 1. Opening, 2. Secretary-General's Report, 3. Chairman of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association's Report and Welcoming Speech, 4. Chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association's Speech and Report, 5. Discussion of Motions, 6. Speeches, 7. Photography, 8. Adjournment.

Attending Members: Those present yesterday included Chairman Zhou Zuomin, Vice-Chairmen Xu Xinliu and Kodama Kenji, Directors Li Fusun, Qian Xinzhi, Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Liu Hongsheng, Yu Zuoting, Yu Qiaqing, Rong Zongjing, Du Yuesheng, Zhong Bingfeng, Wu Zhenxiu, Wu Yunzhai, Lin Kanghou, Yoshida Seiji, Ube Takue, Yamamoto Takeo, and members from both China and Japan, including Wang Xiaolai, Yu Gumin, Wu Qiding, Song Hanzhang, Zhang Peishen, Guo Bingwen, Huang Jiangquan, Yin Tong, Yuan Liang, Ke Ganchen, Xu Xinliu, Wang Yiting, Chen Bofan, Lu Bohong, Lu Ziwen, Li Zhishi, Zhou Wenbin, Xu Xiuzhi, Wang Liangtong, Xu Xungong, Qin Runqing, Zhuang Dezhi, Ye Fuxiao, Dohi Sen, Yamamoto Hitoshi, Yamazaki Suisai, Tanabe Teruo, Yabuki Keiichi, Sato Kiichiro, Tsutsumi Takashi, Ueda Kenjiro, Tachibana Saburo, Tanabe Terugoro, Habu Yoshikichi, Yamanaka Kiichi, Tatsukawa Danzo, Ishida Hideji, as well as Kato Keizaburo, Miyakegawa Hyotaro, Miyajima Seijiro, Fujiyama Aiichiro, Hori Arata, Akiyama Akihisa, Iio Ichiji, Aburaya Boichi, Shoji Otokichi, Ohira Ken, Toyota Risaburo, Ishida Reisuke, and others who came from Japan to participate. At 3:30 PM, the meeting was opened with the ringing of a bell. Secretary-General Xu Xiuzhi announced the opening, stating that the association had a total of 269 members, including 221 Chinese members and 48 Japanese members. There were 131 members present. According to Article 11, Paragraph 3 of the Association's Constitution, a general membership meeting must have at least one-third of the total number of members present to be convened. The legal quorum has now been met, and the meeting can proceed.

Chairman's Speech: After the opening, Chairman Zhou Zuomin took the stage and said, "Chairman Kodama of the Japan-China Trade Association and all the members have taken time out of their busy schedules to attend this meeting from afar. The members of this association are truly grateful and admiring. On behalf of all the members of this association, I extend my highest respect and welcome. Since the establishment of this association, it has been a year and a half. During this period, due to the political environment, the association's affairs have not progressed as expected, which I deeply regret. However, most of the important figures in our country's economic circles have joined this association, which shows that people in our country have a considerable understanding and sympathy for this association. I believe that Japan also has the same trend. Although the members of this association on both sides are people from the business community and have nothing to do with politics, in the current international situation, politics and economics are indeed inseparable. China and Japan were originally like brotherly countries, as mentioned yesterday. Therefore, the economic co-prosperity of the two countries should be developed to the utmost extent, as is clear. However, looking at the trade situation, which is the most important and realistic aspect of the economic relationship between the two countries, last year, Japan's share of China's total foreign trade was only 15.49%. Also, last year, China's share of Japan's total foreign trade was only 7.3%. Although there has been an increase in the last three years, the ratio is still only that. It is obvious that there is still plenty of room for development. If there is great potential for development, but its efficiency is not fully realized, there must be an obstacle in the way. What is this obstacle? The thorny political issues are well known to the world. Now, it is necessary to open up the difficult situation with a new understanding, as also mentioned yesterday. We have all heard and greatly admired Chairman Kodama's repeated great speeches. We firmly believe that now is the opportune time for the relations between China and Japan to improve. The members of this association should help eliminate the obstacles to this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to achieve emotional harmony and make all necessary preparations for cooperation to await its realization. Finally, I hope that the members of this association will exchange opinions frankly and fully on all matters that this association should promote or reform during this short session, thereby increasing the efficiency of this association. I offer my most sincere prayers."

Kodama's Speech: This was followed by a speech by Chairman Kodama of the Japan-China Trade Association, who said, "I am greatly honored to participate in today's meeting as the Chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association and the Vice-Chairman of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association. Chairman Zhou has already described the details of the association in detail, so I need not repeat them. I will briefly describe my impressions. The organization of this association began last year. At that time, the Chinese Economic Survey Mission went to Japan, and both China and Japan felt that it was a good opportunity. In order to make the relationship between the two sides more friendly, there was the organization of this association. Although the association has been established for a year and a half, none of the various hopes have been realized. The two associations in Tokyo and Shanghai have not had any actual consultations, which I deeply regret. This time, our delegation came to your country for inspection. After arriving in Shanghai, we went to Beijing. The impressions we received were very good. We had the honor of being received by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who gave a sincere speech, and met with various authorities of your country's government. After returning to Shanghai yesterday, we had several meetings with leading figures in the business community and influential people in the financial world. Although the time was very short and we did not discuss specific issues, we felt very happy. This alone is a prototype for future hopes, and I am sincerely pleased. Chairman Zhou mentioned just now that politics and economics have a close relationship. Due to the poor political environment, economic cooperation has encountered resistance. This is indeed an undeniable fact. However, the stimulation, environment, and atmosphere that we have obtained in your country this time are all very good. I firmly believe that if we take advantage of this good environment and atmosphere and work together, the expectation of friendship between the two sides will surely be achieved. I am willing to do my best for this, and I hope that you will all work together."

Passing of Resolutions: After the speeches, the resolutions were discussed: (1) Kodama Kenji, Zhou Zuomin, and Xu Xinliu proposed a motion to complete the organization of the association and prepare for its implementation. The motion stated: "Since the establishment of this association, due to environmental factors, it has not been able to progress as expected, which is greatly regretted. However, the establishment of this association originally had a purpose and a mission. To achieve its purpose and mission, it is natural to first determine the steps to be taken and complete the organization of its structure. This association sincerely hopes for the improvement of the environment, but if we wait until the environment improves before we start to implement it, we are afraid that it will be like digging a well when thirsty. Therefore, we should plan to complete the organization of the institution as soon as possible, and prepare all matters that should be prepared in a timely manner to await the opportunity and facilitate implementation. Among the things that should be prepared now, investigation and research should be the priority. Our two general associations originally have investigation departments, and we should immediately find suitable talents to take on their duties separately. Then, we should investigate and research in every way possible where this association can do its best, or accept the entrustment of various related parties and work on investigation and research within the possible scope, so that once the environment improves and the time for implementation arrives, it can be adopted. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly." The resolution was passed to proceed with organization based on the circumstances in both locations. (2) Kodama Kenji, Zhou Zuomin, and Xu Xinliu proposed a motion that members of the association should submit opinions on association affairs at any time and assist in construction. The motion stated: "The various matters that this association should prepare for implementation depend on the collective efforts of all to achieve the effect of collective effort. Since the colleagues of our two general associations are all influential figures in the economic circles of the two countries, if they have insightful opinions and matters that should be investigated and researched on various important matters of this association, they should be submitted to this association at any time so that we can consider handling them. If there are matters that need assistance from this association, we hope that they will not hesitate to provide support to facilitate implementation. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly." The resolution was passed. At 4:15 PM, after the discussion was completed, the entire group took photos in the main hall, had refreshments, and dispersed.

Chairman's Speech: Chairman Wang Xiaolai said in his speech, "Chairman Kodama, esteemed members, esteemed guests, I am deeply honored that you have taken time out of your busy schedules to grace us with your presence today. On behalf of the four associations, I would like to express my gratitude to Chairman Kodama, all members, and guests, and to express our sincere welcome. However, our hospitality may not be adequate, which is not in accordance with the etiquette of welcoming our distinguished guests. I sincerely apologize for this, and I hope you will forgive us. Chairman Kodama and the members are willing to spend valuable time to improve relations between the two countries and have come to China from afar. Before you entered the country, I had the opportunity to read Chairman Kodama's great words and insightful comments in the newspapers, which gave the people of our country a very good impression. I deeply admire this and believe that the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations will be achieved as a result of your visit. In the past few days, the sincerity and enthusiasm with which our government and business community have received you fully demonstrates how eager our country, both in the government and among the people, hopes to improve Sino-Japanese relations. Since the September 18th Incident, it is undeniable that China and Japan have unfortunately been in a state of opposition. However, we will never be discouraged by this, and we feel that this is precisely why we need to make even greater efforts to improve relations between the two countries. You are all leaders and pioneers in the business community of your country, and you must have the power to guide public opinion in your country. I would like to take this opportunity to boldly represent the people of our country and express their true intentions, so that they can be conveyed to the people of your country. I believe that Chairman Kodama's statement that 'Sino-Japanese relations can only be opened up by deepening mutual understanding and cultivating mutual trust' is indeed a perfect statement. Only when the people of the two countries can truly achieve mutual understanding and mutual trust will there be true friendship between the two countries. Since you and I are all comrades who are working hard to promote friendship between the two countries, we should not simply engage in meaningless diplomatic rhetoric at today's meeting. We should frankly reveal our thoughts. I believe that all intelligent people will feel the same way. China is a peace-loving nation, which has been recognized by the world. Recently, feeling the urgency of the national crisis, we have realized that we must unite the national spirit, establish a completely independent and self-reliant modern country, and obtain equal status with other countries in order to achieve true peace. In particular, we deeply understand that only with equal and mutually beneficial friendship and genuine and sincere cooperation between China and Japan can we guarantee permanent peace in the Far East and promote world peace. This is the fundamental national policy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the national spirit of China today. Self-defense is a necessary means of seeking independent survival and is by no means caused without reason. Since the urgent need for friendship between China and Japan is our common belief, there is no need to mention economic cooperation. You have come here to promote economic cooperation between the two countries. We deeply feel that it is not only necessary for the economies of the two countries to cooperate, but also a necessary way to promote friendship between the two countries. Looking at the Sino-Japanese trade over the years, it has not decreased due to the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations. On the one hand, this proves that China is by no means anti-Japanese, and on the other hand, it shows that the economies of the two countries have a close relationship. However, politics and economics are inextricably linked. Without improved political relations, economic relations cannot be promoted. Chairman Kodama once said that although there are many different opinions on economic cooperation, everyone sincerely feels that the improvement of friendly relations between China and Japan and the harmony of the people of the two countries are prerequisites. Under the circumstances of confrontation, it is extremely difficult to make cooperation proceed smoothly. This is indeed a penetrating statement. However, how to promote friendly relations between the two countries and how to reduce the difficulties in carrying out cooperation, in other words, how to eliminate the biggest obstacle between China and Japan at present, is nothing more than first improving the current special situation in North China. If you were to look at it from another perspective, you would have strange feelings. Your country has always believed in Confucius and respected the Kingly Way. Based on the principles of loyalty and forgiveness, the circumstances experienced by the citizens of China should be clear to you and need not be detailed. We have always admired Chairman Kodama and all of you as people who are truly working hard to promote friendship between China and Japan. Therefore, I take this opportunity to frankly express my thoughts without hesitation and ask for your candid advice. We will also accept it with twelve minutes of sincerity, which can be conveyed to our people. Only when we do not hold back at all and exchange our true intentions can the people of the two countries understand and trust each other. At this time of bright spring and the flourishing of all things, distinguished guests have come and are shaking hands and talking happily. The joy is difficult to express. From now on, the relations between the two countries will always be as bright as the spring sunshine, and the people of the two countries will go together on the road to prosperity. This trip by Chairman Kodama and others will not be in vain. I offer a toast to wish Chairman Kodama, all members, and all guests boundless happiness."

Kodama's Reply: Kodama Kenji, the head of the Japanese Economic Survey Mission, replied, "I am deeply grateful for the warm hospitality of the four associations. On behalf of the entire delegation, I would like to express my gratitude. The hopes we have for this trip to China have already been expressed to the correspondent of the Central News Agency stationed in Tokyo before we came to China. I believe you have already seen them. Moreover, what we wanted to say has been expressed completely by Chairman Wang's speech. I will listen carefully. However, I feel that there is a shortcoming. Most of you here are from the business community. According to our ideals, we should talk about business and what kind of business can make money and what kind of business will not lose money. However, what we are talking about is not this, but political issues. This is what we are ashamed of. I remember that I said yesterday that I hope that the people of the two countries can love each other so that we can hope for a solution to the national relations problem. In the work of making the people of the two countries reach mutual love, we can certainly not talk about politics. Today, China and Japan can take advantage of the banquet to express their thoughts and open their hearts, which is a good phenomenon that we have not seen since arriving in China. We hope that the feelings of the people of the two countries will gradually get closer from now on to achieve the goal of true friendship. Now, I would like to use the host's cup of wine to wish you all good health."

Entertainment to Entertain Guests: After the banquet, the four associations held entertainment activities at the association to entertain the guests. The Pudong Native Place Association specially sent Cai Futang as a representative to entertain. The entertainment program was Peking opera: (1) Xiao Gai Jiaotian's "Water Curtain Cave," (2) Lin Shusen and Cheng Shaoyu's "The Old City Instructing the Younger Brother," (3) Qilin Tong Wang Yunfang's "Aspiring to Join the Army," (4) Liang Xiujuan's "The Thirteenth Sister," Kun opera Zhang Chuanfang, Zhu Chuanming, Zhou Chuanying's "Touring the Garden and Startling the Dream," and stacking flowers.

Today's Receptions: Mayor Wu Tiecheng has specially scheduled a banquet at the City Hall at 12:30 PM today to entertain Kodama and others. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the Shipping Association will hold a tea party at the Guangdong Road Club. In the evening, Japanese Consul General stationed in Shanghai, Kawasai Tatsuo, will host a banquet to welcome them.

Municipal Discussion Conference Discussion Issues and Explanations (1) Review of the current municipal system (Explanation) The Guangzhou Municipal Government was established in 1920 when Sun Yat-sen served as the Extraordinary President. This was the earliest municipal government in Chinese history. In 1927, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and promulgated the Municipal Organization Law, establishing the three special municipalities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Since then, many cities have been established across the country, most of which have existed for ten years, except for Guangzhou, or at least several years. During these ten years, the Municipal Organization Law has been amended twice, once in 1928 and once in 1930. The current administrative system of various cities is based on the Municipal Organization Law amended and promulgated on May 20, 1930. Domestic municipal administrators have a considerable understanding of this current system. It is thought that European and American countries have a longer history of municipal administration than China, and their spirit of research and improvement increases with each year, enduring and unremitting, and is worthy of emulation. It is proposed to invite representatives and experts from various provinces and cities to take advantage of the Shanghai Municipal Government's tenth anniversary to conduct a review of the current municipal system for academic research and administrative reference. (2) The impression felt by citizens in the implementation of current municipal laws and regulations in various cities (Explanation) Various cities have formulated various individual laws and regulations and publicly announced rules to meet their needs. The purpose of laws and regulations is: 1. To define the scope and standards of administration; 2. To determine the rights and obligations of citizens; 3. To maintain public safety, health, and order; 4. To crack down on bad habits and behaviors. The above points are originally intended to protect, educate, and nurture the people and to enable administrative officials to know what to follow. However, what is the impact on citizens since the implementation of various laws and regulations, and are there any improvements that can be made based on the experience of implementation? It is proposed to take advantage of the tenth anniversary of Shanghai to conduct a review in principle and welcome citizens to express fair and practical opinions for reference in municipal administration. (3) The difficulties felt in the implementation of current central laws and regulations related to municipal administration (Explanation) The original intention of the central government in promulgating various laws and regulations related to municipal administration is to unify administrative laws and regulations and facilitate the people. However, the distribution of cities across the country, the customs and economic conditions of the people are different, and the environment is different. While many implementations are smooth, difficulties are also not uncommon. It is proposed to invite representatives and experts from various provinces and cities to express their opinions and discuss them in detail for central selection. (4) Discussion on municipal policy guidelines (Explanation) Municipal affairs are numerous and complicated. It is impossible to do everything at once. Regardless of domestic and foreign cities, it is not allowed due to limited human and financial resources. Only by considering national conditions, establishing policy guidelines, and determining the order of business based on the importance and urgency of the business can we proceed. The significance of this topic is to discuss a municipal policy guideline suitable for national conditions in principle, within the scope of economic permission in various places, under the national standing, and to give examples for reference by various cities.

Measures for Hosting Representatives and Experts from Various Provinces and Cities at the Municipal Discussion Conference 1. Representatives and experts from various provinces and cities shall report to the Preparatory Office of the Conference no later than 4:00 PM on July 6, 1937. 2. Representatives and experts from various provinces and cities shall be responsible for their own round-trip transportation and travel expenses. Meals and vehicles during the conference shall be provided by the Municipal Discussion Conference. Escorts should take care of themselves. 3. If representatives and experts from various provinces and cities need to book a hotel, please notify the Preparatory Office of the Conference before June 15th, and specify the grade, number of people, etc. for contact purposes. 4. The Preparatory Office of the Municipal Discussion Conference is located in the Public Utilities Bureau in the center of Shanghai. The telephone numbers are 7721 in the urban area and 46280 in the special district, and the cable registration number is 8338 for communication.

Datong News reports that the Harbor Quarantine Station held its sixth annual banquet at the New Asia Hotel at 8 PM yesterday. Over a hundred people from customs authorities, health officials, and leaders of the Chinese and foreign shipping industries attended, making it a grand occasion. The details are recorded below:

Guest List

Those present included Zheng Lai, Director of Customs Affairs; Meierhe, Inspector General of Customs; Zhu Changnian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs; Ba Runsen, Customs Commissioner; Li Ting'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau; Jordan, Director of the Health Department of the Public Works Department; La Bushuo, Director of the Health Department of the French Municipal Council; Cai Zengji, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Yu Qiaqing of the Sanbei Company; Jiali Ai of the Java China Japan Line; Zhu Meixian of the Ning Shao Company; Yang Meifu of the Taikoo Dockyard; Lu Bohong of the Datong Company; Sugiban of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha; Yamamoto Takeo of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha; Baodewei of the Dalai Company; Meiqushi of the Norddeutscher Lloyd; Briscillo of the Italian Shipping Company; and over a hundred others.

Banquet Situation

The banquet began at 8:30 PM, and Director Wu Liande, accompanied by Technician Wu Changyue, Secretary Zhou Zhongqian, Advisor Chen Yonghan, and Medical Officer Jin Naiyi, provided cordial hospitality. Toasts were exchanged, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. Halfway through the banquet, Director Wu stood up to give a speech and reported on the work situation last year. Then, Inspector General Mei delivered a speech, and finally, General Manager Jiali Ai of the Java China Japan Line gave a reply on behalf of the shipping industry, expressing his gratitude (the speech is omitted). The guests and hosts dispersed in joy at around 11 PM.

Wu's Speech

Tonight, I am deeply honored to have the authorities of the Customs, health officials, and leaders of the Chinese and foreign shipping industries grace us with their presence. This is the sixth annual banquet, and I am able to gather with you all. Therefore, I will briefly contribute some humble words and hope for your guidance. In the past few years, the shipping industry has provided a great deal of assistance and cooperation to us. I hope that we will continue to promote this spirit in the future. Our goal is to apply the latest international quarantine methods. With the assistance of the shipping industry, quarantine work can be further improved. Regarding the policy of quarantine management, we adhere to the following main principles: We share the responsibility of epidemic prevention with various coastal countries, closely supervise diseases transmitted by ships, and at the same time, we try to facilitate imported ships without interference, so as not to affect the prosperity of the port. Now, let me give you an example. In 1932, due to the tidal water of the Huangpu River, if all imported ships were to anchor in Wusong to wait for inspection, it would take too much time. Therefore, it was decided that from that year onwards, all ships could temporarily enter the port and dock for inspection, provided that they reported the situation on board in advance. Everything was normal, and there were no quarantinable diseases or deaths. The adoption of this measure seemed quite revolutionary, but judging from the results of the past few years, it can indeed prove the appropriateness of our handling. This reform has not hindered our work in any way or reduced its effectiveness, and our relationship with the shipping industry has increased because of this. It is now heard that the health authorities of the Port of New York in the United States have recently made a similar reform, that is, under certain conditions, passenger ships can directly enter the port without having to wait on the quarantine island. Although we boldly took this measure six years ago, we are not complacent about it, because we are not bound by traditional habits, and we are not afraid to implement reforms that do not conflict with the fundamental principles of quarantine. We now gradually understand the cause of diseases and their transmission, rather than the previous blind fear, so all preventive methods are also more rationalized, and harbor quarantine can be integrated with industry and commerce, no longer trapped in isolation. Taking this port as an example, we have received a lot of assistance from the shipping industry. The relationship between customs and quarantine is very close. Before the establishment of the current harbor quarantine agency, all quarantine work in various ports was handled by the customs, which laid the foundation for the existing quarantine organization in our country. Until 1930, the Harbor Quarantine Station was established and gradually took over the quarantine affairs of various ports. The customs side still provided assistance to ensure smooth progress. We are very grateful for the sincere assistance of Inspector General Mei Lehe, various customs supervisors, commissioners, and staff. Now, please allow me to briefly describe the general situation of this port's work last year. The inspection affairs are very busy, and all colleagues are working hard. The total tonnage of imported ships was more than 14 million tons, with a total of 1,821 ships. In terms of tonnage, the United Kingdom ranks first, followed by Japan, and the United States ranks third. In terms of nationality, there are a total of 14 countries. The number of imported passengers is about 113,000 (including 50,000 Chinese). Violations of quarantine regulations have been greatly reduced, which shows that the spirit of cooperation in the shipping industry is improving. Although fumigation affairs have not developed, everything is proceeding as usual. The fumigation equipment in Shanghai is the latest type, and the certificates issued are recognized by various countries without any difficulties. The seventh report of this station is now in print. When you receive it in the future, you will know that we are not only busy dealing with daily work, but also committed to scientific research related to quarantine. The cholera overview and plague overview we have compiled have been published successively and have been well received by the medical community at home and abroad. Finally, I would like to thank you all for attending this annual banquet. I and all my colleagues would like to raise a glass to wish all the guests good health.

Mei Lehe's Speech

Tonight, I am greatly honored to be invited by Director Wu to attend this grand banquet. I am even more terrified to be mentioned for the assistance of the Customs to quarantine and to be praised so much. Director Wu's work achievements are known to both China and foreign countries and need not be repeated by me. He presided over the epidemic prevention work in the Northeast as early as 1910, with remarkable results, and was promoted as an authority in the medical field, and his reputation has grown. In recent years, the government has given him the important position of harbor quarantine, and he has made many contributions. Tracing back to 1930, he took over all the quarantine affairs under the management of the Customs and worked hard to rectify them. Taking this port as an example, its achievements are no less than those of other important ports in the world. It also provides convenience to imported ships, and at the same time, it does not reduce the efficiency of quarantine. Chinese and foreign merchants unanimously praised it. In addition to admiration, I am deeply grateful to the government for getting the right person. Now, I would like to wish Director Wu and his colleagues success in their careers and unlimited future.

### Representatives from All Walks of Life Held a Memorial Meeting for "March 18th" Yesterday Morning

The Whole City Flies Flags at Half-Mast to Express Mourning

Guomin News reports that yesterday was the "March 18th" Beijing Revolutionary Memorial Day. The Municipal Party Department of this city convened representatives from all walks of life at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the department to hold a memorial meeting. Those present included Jiang Hao, member of the Municipal Party Department; Huang Zao Xiong of the Municipal Education Association; Lin Kecong of the Municipal Women's Association; Du Mengsen of the Cooperative Business Promotion Association; Huang Xianggu of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association; Mao Yun of the Second Special Municipality Residents Association; Li Weiliang of the Living Mutual Aid Society; Hu Shouqi of the Southern District Residents Association; Li Jirong of the Zhiguang Society; and the guilds of inlaying teeth, warehouses, the First District Shui Mu, and other labor unions; the Jiangsu Ningbo and other fellow villagers associations; and representatives from schools such as Minli, Shangren, Dezhi, and Da Zhonghua, totaling over two hundred people.

Chairman's Report

The report was given by Chairman Jiang Hao, who stated, "Representatives, comrades, today is the anniversary of the 'March 18th' Beijing people's revolution. Let me first report on the facts of this event. In the spring of 1926, the Zhilu Allied Army and the National Army were in a stalemate in the Pingjin area. In order to prevent the Zhilu Army's Bohai Fleet from attacking, the National Army blockaded the Dagukou and prohibited the passage of all Chinese and foreign ships. It is the right of an independent country to block its own sea mouth in its territorial waters, but the imperialists do not care about your rights. Japanese warships deliberately sailed in first and bombarded Dagukou on March 12th. Not only that, but on March 16th, the Dutch minister, on behalf of the countries of the Boxer Protocol, invoked the Boxer Protocol, issued an ultimatum, and mobilized warships of various countries to carry out threats. At this point, the people of Beijing, seeing the Beijing warlord government's repeated acts of appeasement and humiliation of the country, expected that it would yield and recognize its demands. Therefore, on March 18th, they held a national assembly outside Tiananmen, gathered to discuss countermeasures, and petitioned the Executive Government. Who knew that the Executive Government not only did not accept the people's well-intentioned advice, but ordered the guards to open fire and strafe the people. As a result, more than fifty people were martyred on the spot, more than seventy were seriously injured, and countless were slightly injured. This is the heroic sacrifice suffered by the people of the Northern Revolution who fought against the warlord government and imperialists to safeguard national rights. From the revelation of this incident, we can clearly know that the warlords are completely motivated by personal interests. They only seek temporary peace and preserve their territory. They do not hesitate to kneel before the enemy and offer the country's lifeline and people's lives with both hands. On the one hand, they regard the people as the only enemy and use their power, resorting to both knives and guns. As for the imperialists, their only premise for weak nations is to invade them to their heart's content. They play with those warlords and traitors who sell the country for glory according to their whims. Only for the revolutionary people, they are afraid on the one hand and regard them as the only enemy on the other hand, and use various direct and indirect methods to kill them. We know the true face of the warlords and imperialists. We know that the people of Beijing suffered this heroic sacrifice under the dual oppression of the warlords and imperialists. What is the significance of our commemoration of them today? Many revolutionary people in Beijing sacrificed under the destruction of the evil forces of the warlords and imperialists eleven years ago. Now let's take a look at our real environment. After the success of the Northern Expedition, the evil forces of the warlords were indeed overthrown one by one, but are not most of the predecessors of many traitors who sell their motherland and their souls today warlords? As for imperialism, let's take a look at the situation in recent years since 1926. The May 3rd Massacre, the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and the banditry in the three provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Sui are not all good gifts bestowed by our neighbors? In our current environment, the suffering caused by the remnants of the warlords, the traitors, and the imperialists is a hundred times greater than before 1926. The only significance of our commemoration of the 'March 18th' martyrs today is to emulate the spirit of sacrificing for the country of the predecessors, unite together, and strive forward on the bloody road to save the country from disaster. On the one hand, everyone should vigorously implement the New Life Movement, so that the spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame can be realized in the actual life of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Then we can create citizens with high morals, rich knowledge, and strong physique. Everyone can be a modern citizen with the highest combat power. On the one hand, we must vigorously implement the National Economic Construction Movement, save everyone's waste, and concentrate the country's financial resources to enrich the lives of the people and build the national economic power of national defense. Enriching the individual's intellectual, moral, and physical education and building the economic power of the national lifeline are the two major basic tasks for saving the country at present. We must save the country and ourselves. Only by making these two tasks our lifelong goals can we succeed. At the same time, at present, we must eliminate the Red bandits and traitors in order to eliminate the hidden loyalty within our nation and achieve the practical effect of securing the country internally and resisting foreign aggression. Comrades, today we commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed in the 'March 18th' in Beijing. We must complete the mission that we should continue to strive for. We can only support the overall national policy of the central government and work together under the leadership of the great leader Chiang Kai-shek."

Meeting Slogans

Memorial slogans: (1) "March 18th" is the memorial day for the Beijing people's sacrifice for the country. (2) To commemorate "March 18th", we must eliminate the remaining Red bandits. (3) To commemorate "March 18th", we must eradicate all traitors. (4) The spirit of the "March 18th" martyrs is immortal. (5) Long live the Three Principles of the People. (6) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang. (7) Long live the Republic of China.

### Kowloon Representatives Going to Beijing, Lu Zhang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

The Outcome of Discussions Was Very Satisfactory

The Hong Kong government's forceful demolition of the walled city of Kowloon and the expulsion of its residents has aroused resentment among Kowloon residents. They elected Lu Zhang as their representative to go to Beijing to petition the central government, requesting the government to quickly negotiate with the British side. Lu, upon receiving the order, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and immediately transferred to Beijing to petition. Having completed his mission, he returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to a statement to the Central News Agency reporter, after arriving in Beijing, he met successively with the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Interior to petition. The outcome was very satisfactory. Foreign Minister Wang paid particular attention to the case. He personally presented three requests to Foreign Minister Wang: ã earnestly requesting the government to quickly negotiate with the British government, ã earnestly requesting the government to quickly protect the safety of Kowloon residents, and ã earnestly requesting the government to demand compensation from the British government for the losses suffered by Kowloon residents. Foreign Minister Wang accepted all these requests. Believing that his mission was accomplished, he plans to return south within days.

### Successful Trial Run of the New Shanghai-Quanzhou Route

New Maritime Chart No. 975 Completed; Changfeng Ship Successfully Completed Trial Voyage

Over the years, dozens of ships sailing between Shanghai and Quanzhou, Fujian, have struck reefs and sunk, resulting in losses of life and property amounting to tens of millions of dollars. Last year, Xu Zufan of the insurance industry and Yao Shumin of the shipping industry requested the Naval Hydrographic Office of the Ministry of the Navy to survey and chart a new waterway for this route. They also requested the Customs Port Affairs Office to establish indicators along the Shanghai-Quanzhou sea route.

All Completed

Generally, two red and black buoys are set up at Jixinqi (i.e., south of Dazhui Island) to guide merchant ships through the shoals between Dazhui and Xiaozhui Islands. In addition, two navigation marker poles are set up near Rihu Pagoda to guide merchant ships past the shoals south of Xiaozhui Island. Also, Jixinqi is equipped with red and black lighted buoys; fearing that they may be moved by tides and waves, the two marker poles will serve as accurate indicators. Other lighthouses have been added along the new route. From now on, the Shanghai-Quanzhou route can be permanently safe. After the completion of this project, the Customs has notified shipping companies. The Minxin Shipping Company of this port immediately dispatched the Changtai ship as a

Route Lighthouse

in order to ensure permanent safety. After many months of surveying and charting, the Hydrographic Office has now completed the survey and charted the new Quanzhou sea route, listed as No. 975. The chart details the hidden reefs and shoals near Dazhui and Xiaozhui Islands, as well as the rise and fall of tides. The water depth within the new channel is very deep. At the shallowest point, there are thirty feet at high tide and fifteen feet at low tide. Even deep-draft seagoing ships can safely navigate at half-tide without any danger. As for the establishment of navigation lighthouses and other facilities by the Customs, the Changtai ship has already completed the

Trial Voyage on the New Route

The ship traveled from Shanghai to Quanzhou and back to Shanghai, following this new route in accordance with the new chart No. 975 and the lighthouses and marker poles set up by the Customs. It has arrived safely without any danger. Shipping companies and insurance firms are very satisfied with the facilities provided by the Hydrographic Office and the Customs.

### Brief Shipping Report

The Craigned, which ran aground and sank off Sydney, Australia, was purchased by Chinese merchants in this port and used for dismantling after arriving in Shanghai. It ran aground and sank off Sydney on the 15th of this month. It sank into the sea in just one hour. All the crew members escaped safely, and none were killed. The shipowner is named Lair. This ship was insured by the American Asia Insurance Company of this port. Because it was not used for navigation, it was not registered with the Maritime Administration Bureau. The shipwrecked crew members are now returning to Shanghai on another ship.

The Sanbei Hongheng ship ran aground on the Jiangkou River in the upper reaches on the 16th and could not be freed for a while. The Hongzhen ship has now been dispatched with a barge to unload cargo. News was received yesterday that the Hongheng had not yet been towed out of the shallows.

Sichuan suffered a severe drought last year, and food is scarce for the people. A large quantity of rice has been purchased from Hankou, Jiujiang, and Wuhu to provide relief. Due to shallow waters blocking the Sichuan River waterway, various shipping companies are now transferring the cargo to Shashi and using civilian boats to transport it into Sichuan.

In the case of the Haiheng ship colliding with a sampan, resulting in two deaths, the family members of the deceased went to the China Merchants Bureau yesterday to seek compensation. The Bureau refused because the fault lies with the sampan. The local court also sent a summons to the Bureau yesterday, calling on the ship's senior crew members to appear in court for questioning. The Bureau decided to submit a written statement of reasons, stating that the case has been reported to the Maritime Administration Bureau and, according to regulations, is not under the jurisdiction of the court.

### Patrick Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

Returned from Inspection in South China

Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, went to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong on the 2nd of this month to inspect the economic situation in South China. After half a month, Patrick, believing that his mission was completed, took the McKinley President of the Dollar Steamship Company from Hong Kong and returned north, arriving here at 8:30 yesterday morning. His secretary, Solley, and others arrived at the port to welcome him. Patrick's itinerary has been formally announced in Hong Kong. It is understood that Patrick will rest briefly in Shanghai before going to North China and Central China to inspect.

### All Silk Weaving Workers in the City Resumed Work as Ordered

According to Da Gong She, after the Party and government authorities jointly issued a notice prohibiting strikes in the city's silk factories, the workers, in order to show their obedience, all resumed work last night in the seventeen silk factories in Pudong, Puxi, and Zhabei that were on strike.

### He Yaozu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Envoy to Turkey, He Yaozu, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 7:00 yesterday morning. Whether He's resignation has been withdrawn is reportedly still under consideration, so there is no definite date for when he will go to Turkey to resume his post.

### Yu Qiaqing's Remarks on the Wugu Village Case

The Municipal Council Did Not Report to the Board of Directors; Directors Raised Questions During the Meeting

According to Xin Sheng She, regarding the dispute caused by residents of Wugu Village, who refused to pay Municipal Council house tax, after the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Council agreed on a solution, a reporter interviewed Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese director of the Municipal Council, yesterday to inquire about his thoughts on the case. He replied that some of the residents there have paid the house tax, while others have not. This matter should have been resolved through consultation with the Municipal Government. The fault does not lie with the residents. The Municipal Council's decisive handling of this matter was also inappropriate. The case was never reported to the Board of Directors, so it was not known in advance. During the Municipal Council Board of Directors meeting yesterday (the 17th), some directors raised questions. Subsequently, the Director-General reported that a peaceful resolution had been reached.

### Silk Weaving Industry Association Hosted the Press Yesterday

Cai Shengbai Reported on the Situation of the Industry

The Shanghai Electric Silk Weaving Factory Operators Association hosted reporters from various newspapers at Xinghualou on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, with over thirty people in attendance. Cai Shengbai, chairman of the association, reported that the history of the silk weaving industry in Shanghai is only about twenty years. Before the founding of the Republic of China, there was nothing worth mentioning. The Wuhua Factory first started it, and gradually others followed, increasing the number of looms to about 8,000. However, before 1927, there were only about 2,000 looms in Shanghai. After the January 28th Incident, due to the influence of the economic environment, the number of looms decreased sharply from 7,000 or 8,000 to just over 4,000. Until recently, it has increased slightly to just over 5,000. The reasons for the increases and decreases can be stated as follows: 1. Due to the diligence and thrift of the operators; 2. Due to the influence of the social economy. The silk weaving industry in Shanghai, except for a few factories like Meiya, Tianyi, Meiwen, Damei, and Meifeng, which have a larger number of looms, most others have only dozens or as few as two or three looms. It seems that they have not yet broken away from the model of family industry, and there are absolutely no capitalists who invest heavily to operate them. Therefore, most of the silk weaving factory owners in Shanghai are former silk weaving workers. They usually use their wages to save money and buy one or two looms to weave in their homes, working hard day and night and never leaving the position of laborers. When they become slightly better off, they dare not enjoy themselves and add more looms. The weavers they hire are either relatives or friends, maintaining their relationship through emotions and not bound by conditions. Many factories have gradually expanded their base in this way. Therefore, other industries may have so-called capitalists, but there are no capitalists in the silk weaving industry in Shanghai. Even in the case of Meiya and Tianyi, there are quite a few workers who are shareholders. After 1927, the number of looms gradually increased because the workers' skills gradually matured and their savings gradually became considerable, so they all bought their own looms. This is the real factor in increasing the number of looms. It is not that capitalists saw that there was profit to be made and hurriedly invested. After the January 28th Incident, due to the bankruptcy of the rural areas and the decline of the social economy, all industries were in decline. Civilians had little surplus power to buy cloth, and silk became a surplus commodity. In general, silk weaving factories, due to their nature as family industries, had no liquid funds to accumulate inventory, so they had to stop their machines and close their businesses. Among them, those with a solid foundation, for the sake of ensuring the livelihood of their workers, worked hard to support themselves and maintain their operations, but they were also in difficult and arduous circumstances, barely making ends meet. The hardships in this situation are beyond the knowledge of outsiders. We are engaged in business, half of which is for the sake of our own livelihood, and half of which is not for the sake of the country and the nation. Silk satin is originally a unique and superior product of our country. Before the silk weaving industry was developed, imported goods poured in. In recent years, domestically produced silk satin has improved in technology and increased in production, and imported goods have gradually declined. This is not unrelated to the efforts of the domestic silk weaving industry to reduce a part of the outflow of wealth. Therefore, even after experiencing hardships, we still support them. If you ask whether there is a foreign silk weaving factory in Shanghai, you can understand it. Last year's bumper harvest of agricultural products caused all industries to turn around slightly, and outsiders thought that the silk weaving industry must also benefit from it. Who knows that the distress of the silk weaving industry has not decreased? In the first half of the year, silk sales did not increase much, and the price of silk from the previous year rose sharply, and the cost was extraordinarily high, but the price of silk supply and demand did not reach an equal relationship, and it could not be raised. In the second half of the year, silk sales seemed to move, but the price of silk rose sharply again due to the movement of foreign traders, which increased the cost of silk satin, but it was difficult for the selling price to be in an equal proportion to the cost. Even if there was a small profit, it was only enough to pay official interest, and there was no dividend to be obtained. This can be verified by the final accounts reports of various factories. In short, the silk weaving industry has never reached the ideal realm of affluence, and in the midst of the hardships of the past few years, it has never forgotten the national industry of the country, and it must be fully revitalized, or at least maintained without defeat. Therefore, the total monthly output of silk fabrics in the city last year reached 160,000 pieces in the busiest month, and the annual average was worth about 30 million yuan, accounting for one-fifth of the national silk fabric production, which seems to have fulfilled one or two responsibilities for the national product, without self-reproach. However, due to the dumping of smuggled goods, it is even more difficult to make a profit on the selling price. After the great closure last year, the factories this year started work extremely late, because sales are not moving, the economy is not easy to turn around, and they have to reluctantly start work because they are worried about the livelihood of the workers. Also, last winter, in order to assist the government in cracking down on smuggling, the association vigorously carried out anti-smuggling work within the industry. All silk weaving factories in the city joined the association in order to carry out national law and enthusiastically love the country, so as to increase the strength of the association. The products of the industry are all investigated by the association's personnel to investigate the source of its raw materials, and to audit its consumption and inventory. Each piece of finished product is stamped with the association's certification stamp. The customs can allow it to purchase rayon and release the finished product only with the association's certificate. Since the implementation of this anti-smuggling work, rayon smuggling has become more difficult to import and cannot be sold. According to the Customs report, very few confiscated smuggled rayon have been found recently. However, the association's expenses have increased sharply due to the vigorous anti-smuggling work, which is all jointly borne by the industry. We claim that we dare not lag behind others in loving the country, and we do not only think of our own interests, but we put the country and the nation first. However, the members of the association have little knowledge and are always in danger of failing. I hope that the society will give guidance and assistance at any time, which is really hoped for.

### The Municipal Council Health Department's Budget for This Year

Approximately 5% Higher Than Last Year

The draft budget for the expenditure of the Health Department of the Municipal Council for 1937 has been reviewed by the Council's Board of Directors and approved for consideration by the Finance Committee. The main points are supplemented as follows:

(A) Recurring Expenditures

Excluding the purchase of supplies, allowances, and subsidies, a total of 1,809,600 yuan is required, an increase of 168,880 yuan over the previous year, which is approximately 12%. According to the Director of the Health Department, all kinds of expenditures have been rigorously budgeted and cannot be saved any further. This year, the Department plans to hire two assistant physicians and one temporary assistant physician, respectively, for school medical affairs, prison hospitals, and summer and autumn cholera eradication campaigns. The required expenditures have been included in the budget. The expenses required for mosquito eradication have been increased by 20,950 yuan. There are many facilities that need to be expanded for this kind of work, but due to financial constraints, they have been reduced to a minimum. In order to prevent smallpox and cholera, it is planned to add four full-time nurses. The required expenses have been included in the budget. After studying the above-mentioned entire budget, the Director of Finance reduced the amount as appropriate and set it at 1,711,400 yuan, an increase of approximately 5% over the previous year. The expenses of the chemical laboratory, pharmacy, and various hospitals have increased, and the income of the slaughterhouse and meat market has decreased. The French Concession Municipal Council has independently devised a method to eradicate mosquitoes, and has stopped subsidizing the expenses required by the Municipal Council for this matter. These facts are all the reasons for the increase in expenditures.

(B) Special Expenditures

Special expenditures are divided into two categories, A and C. Category A is those that have been approved by the Board of Directors or are considered important. Category C is those that should not be allocated this year in terms of economic conditions and other aspects. The details are as follows: ã Expanding the West District Infectious Disease Hospital, adding a land purchase fee of 41,000 yuan, listed in Category A. ã The construction cost is tentatively set at 599,450 yuan, of which 300,000 yuan is for the construction of the West District Infectious Disease Hospital, 125,000 yuan is for the reconstruction of the Aerodrome Road vegetable market, and 35,000 yuan is for the addition of the Avenue Edward VII sanitary branch, all of which are listed in Category C. The project fee for the slaughterhouse and cattle shed, in addition to the part that has been spent last year, still requires 20,000 yuan. The project fee for the slaughterhouse's pig slaughtering place is 26,000 yuan, the machinery and equipment are 35,000 yuan, and the equipment fee for the central laundry is 20,000 yuan, all of which are listed in Category A.

### Bad Children Stole Letters from Mailboxes and Tore Off Stamps to Exchange for Money

Stole As Many As Thirteen Letters in Total; Arrested and Interrogated After Being Reported by Postman; Small Tobacco and Paper Shop Owner Accused of Receiving Stolen Goods

Zhou Mingbiao and Zhu Amao, two twelve-year-old children from Ningbo, stole as many as thirteen letters from the postal mailbox at Avenue Petain and Dalianwan Road at 7:45 PM on the 9th of this month. They tore off the stamps and exchanged them for newspapers and copper coins at nearby tobacco and paper shops, totaling seventeen stamps of one fen, five fen, and ten fen. The case was discovered when postman Zhou Xinyi reported to the Yulin Road police station. Detective Li Hongsheng arrested the two children and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention pending trial. During the trial, the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case found that the stolen stamps had been sold to Hu Dongchen, a Zhenjiang native who opened a small tobacco and paper shop at No. 335 Avenue Petain. They went to investigate and found old stamps of one fen (two pieces), two fen (one piece), and three jiao (one piece). Hu Dongchen claimed that the stamps from the two children were handled by his son, Hu Shixian, and he was unaware of them. Yesterday morning, the police station summoned Hu and his son and sent them to the Third Criminal Court along with Zhou and Zhu. Zhang Tianyin, the Municipal Council's lawyer, stated that Zhou had a pawn ticket for seventeen yuan, which was found to be owned by someone named Jia, who works at the World Book Company in Shanghai. Hu Dongchen and his son were prosecuted for receiving stolen goods. Zhou confessed that he sold two five-fen stamps to Hu Shixian, getting twenty-five copper coins, giving twelve coins to Zhu and exchanging the rest for newspapers, so that he could stuff them into the mailbox to pad the bottom and steal letters. Zhu insisted that Zhou invited him to help steal letters and peel off stamps. Hu Dongchen confessed that his three-jiao stamp was returned by a Qingkou person who sent an airmail letter and exchanged it for a five-fen stamp to keep in the store, not from the two children. Hu Shixian's confession was evasive, and he hired a lawyer to request bail. Judge Chuan Lin ordered Zhou and Zhu to be remanded in custody, and Hu Dongchen and Hu Zhixian were each allowed to stop detention with a 200-yuan bond, and the case was changed to a hearing.

### Zhu Xuefan Left the Country Yesterday to Attend the International Textile and Labor Conferences

Two Proposals to Inspect Factories and Stop Smuggling; Zhu Published a Written Statement on the Ship

Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union Committee, was appointed by the Central Government as a representative to attend the World Textile Conference and the Labor Representative to the 23rd International Labor Conference. Zhu boarded the McKinley President of the Dollar Steamship Company yesterday morning at 11:30 AM and set sail. The city's labor community held a grand send-off. Zhu published a statement on the ship, and the details are as follows:

Enthusiastic Send-Off

Those who went to the Bund Customs Wharf yesterday morning to send off Zhu included Du Yuesheng and his son Weifan, Huang Renzhi, Huang Bodu, Lin Kanghou, Director Cai Jinjun's representative Chen Guangzong, Lu Jingshi, Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Ye Xianggao, Gong Yuting, Wu Shaoshu, Sun Lufing, Chen Haifeng, Zhao Banfu, Xu Caicheng, Zhang Kechang, Yu Yaoqiu, Lu Muqin, Guo Lanxin, Tang Shichang, and various groups, including Heng She, Yi She, Yongjin She, the Twenty-Two Societies Association of Caojiadu, the Labor Association, and various labor unions, including the National Postal, Shanghai Postal, Postal Workers, Fourth District Cigarette, First District Water and Electricity, Tenth District Cotton Spinning, British Tramway, Ninth District Soap and Medicine, Military Uniform, Automobile Driver and Training Team, Tug and Barge, Wharf Mutual Aid Association, First District Cosmetics, Huxi Nissha Welfare Society, Fourth District Rubber, Sauce Industry, Tang Tablets, Brewing, Hotel, Seventh District Silk Weaving, Fifth District Shoulder Carrying, Civilian Boat, Fourth District Hat Making, Third District Silk Weaving, Pharmaceutical Industry, and Fifth District Papermaking, etc. Various schools included Minli Middle School, Yangjian Primary School, Lunshan Children's Primary School, and Lunshan Woodworking Research Primary School, with more than 1,000 representatives gathering at the wharf to send off, setting off firecrackers, and hiring several small ferries to accompany them, with extremely enthusiastic emotions.

Going Abroad to Attend the Meeting

Zhu arrived at the New Customs Wharf at 10:30 AM. After bidding farewell to the well-wishers, he took the scheduled Yuebao small ferry to Bailianjing and transferred to the Dollar Steamship Company's McKinley President ship, which set sail from Shanghai at 11:30 AM. After Zhu arrives in the United States, he will attend the World Textile Conference held in Washington on April 2, and then proceed to Geneva to attend the 23rd International Labor Conference on June 3. Then, he will go to the UK for inspection and is expected to return to China and Shanghai in early August.

Our Proposals

We have no proposals for the World Textile Conference. However, at the meeting, our country's employer and labor representatives will make a detailed report on the current situation of the textile industry in our country for reference by the conference. As for the 23rd International Labor Conference, our country has two official proposals: ã Factory inspection; ã Stopping smuggling. In addition, we will make greater efforts to promote the implementation of the case of equal treatment for Chinese and foreign workers, which was proposed at the last (20th) conference.

Farewell Remarks

Zhu published a written statement to reporters on the ship, saying that he was appointed as a representative to attend the World Textile Conference and the 23rd International Labor Conference. He considered himself to be incompetent and was deeply afraid that he would not be able to win. Moreover, he was tied up in affairs and could not get rid of them in fact. However, the Central Government believed that he had attended the conference last time, and that he was more familiar with the people and places, so he could no longer send secretaries and advisors to accompany him to save expenses, and he could not resign. He had to reluctantly accept his shortcomings. This trip will first go to Washington to participate in the World Textile Conference. This is the first time that our country has participated in this conference, and there are no proposals. After the meeting, he will go to Geneva to attend the 23rd International Labor Conference held on June 3. The agenda of this conference is to discuss the safety of construction workers and the reduction of working hours in the textile, printing, and chemical industries, and to revise the conventions on the minimum age of industrial and non-industrial workers. The reduction of working hours is the second stage of the two-level discussion procedure of this conference. The conference can formulate international conventions based on the replies of various countries. In European and American countries with advanced industries and overproduction, reducing working hours can indeed adjust the supply and demand of labor and relieve unemployment. Our country's industry is still in its infancy, and we need to bury our heads and step up production, so there is no such need at present. I plan to submit two proposals to the conference on the Japanese in China smuggling and factory inspection. The former not only directly affects the livelihoods of workers, but also shakes China's entire finance. The international community should have a full and correct understanding of this despicable behavior in order to promote public opinion sanctions. As for the issue of factory inspection in the concessions, the International Labor Bureau has made great efforts to mediate in the past. Although there have been many negotiations over the years, it has not been completely resolved. This matter is of great importance to the livelihood, health, well-being, and sovereignty of workers, and most of China's current industries are in the concession areas and operated by foreign capital, so the solution to this problem is extremely urgent. China is currently on the road to becoming an industrial society, and the labor issue has gradually been noticed by all parties. This is truly a gratifying phenomenon, but the suffering and status of workers are often overlooked by the general public. We believe that the construction of a new country is by no means a task that can be shouldered by a few people. In other words, in the process of production and construction, capital and labor are equally important. Only by ensuring that workers' lives are secure and economic construction can be smoothly promoted. This trip is expected to return to the country in about four days. Today, I am very grateful for the long-distance send-off from friends from all walks of life. I hope that you will give me your advice at any time to help me overcome my shortcomings.

### Glamorously Dressed Actress Excites Courtroom Audience

Wang Caiyun Appears in Court for Car Case, Attracting Attention from General Litigants

In recent years, various industries in society have been experiencing an economic downturn, and the number of unemployed people is increasing daily. "Finding new ways" and "seeking sustenance" have become a common cry among the masses. However, the entertainment industry has surprisingly been blessed with unique advantages and is still developing vigorously. As a result, actors and talents are cultivated daily due to the promotion of the leisure class. Taking just the currently flourishing

Shanghai Opera Department

as an example, its variety has increased many times over the past, and the number of male and female actors is countless. Among them, there are many who have become famous and are popular for a time. For example, Wang Caiyun, a female actress who performs at venues like the New New Company, is still a middle-ranking talent, but her luxury in clothing and accessories can rival aristocratic women. If we consider those even higher up, then their

Extravagant Actions

are not difficult to imagine. Yesterday afternoon, Caiyun was sued in the First Special District Local Court by Livi Auto Company for failing to pay car repair fees and other expenses. She specially accompanied her younger brother to the court to await trial, dressed in unusually beautiful attire. She wore a light green silk cheongsam and brown leather shoes. A diamond ring adorned the middle finger of her left hand, while the middle and ring fingers of her right hand each sported a ruby and jade ring. On her left wrist was

A Gold Bar

As she stood in front of Courtroom 13 before the trial began. The location was originally a long corridor, with courtrooms on both sides. It was not exposed to sunlight all day long. Although there were two or three electric lights overhead, the light was dim. People who came here could not help but feel darkness. Now, the brilliance of Caiyun's diamonds and jewels shone into their eyes, causing the gaze of general litigants in this long alleyway to involuntarily focus on her. Caiyun had a graceful and slender figure,

Cheeks Dyed with Rouge

Under the gaze of the crowd, the peach blossoms on her cheeks became even redder. The most criticized point was a bunch of keys hanging from the button of her right rib's placket, numbering about seven or eight. These were probably the opening tools for all the chests and cabinets in her home. Now that she had to carry them with her at all times, and did not put them in her pocket, they were visibly displayed. Therefore, many who saw her said that the girl intended to show off. Soon after, the judge returned and opened the court with the clerk. Caiyun was then summoned by the bailiff to appear in court for trial. However,

Livi Auto Company

had no representative present. According to Caiyun's statement, although her car was purchased from the company, the repairs were undertaken by another company, so she did not owe the plaintiff any money. The judge then stated that because the plaintiff had not appeared, the trial could not proceed and announced that the case would be adjourned. Wang Caiyun then tightly grasped a copy of the lawsuit and a summons delivered to her by the court and slowly walked out of the courtroom with her younger brother to return home. In this shadow, fleeting like a startled swan, the sound of laughter "It's a pity that her eyes are slightly different in size" could still be heard where she passed.

### Record of Court Hearing on Termination of Adoption of Adopted Daughter

Adopted Daughter Only Asks for Fifty Dollars, Hostess Ferociously Refuses, Judge Persuades Her to Give Twenty

Liang Xingqing, a Cantonese clerk at Shihe Jewelry Company, lives at No. 9 Wenjing Lane, Wuchang Road, Hongkou. His wife, Chen Peiqiong, also from Lingnan, is over thirty years old and is usually very strict at home. In the past, she adopted a daughter named Xiuzhen. Now the girl is nineteen years old and treats Liang and Chen like her parents, but Chen treats her like a servant. The girl could not bear it and quietly ran away last month. After Chen reported it, the Hongkou Police Station found the girl and handed her over to the court for trial. Chen was ordered to take her back, but the girl was deeply afraid of being subjected to further

Cruel Abuse

after returning, so she has not returned. Chen then hired a lawyer to submit a petition to the First Special District Local Court, requesting the termination of the adoption relationship with Xiuzhen. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji opened the court for trial. Li Xiuzhen also appeared in court with her lawyer. The girl's blue cheongsam, velvet short jacket, and leather shoes were all worn and tattered. Her short hair was disheveled, and her face was sad. She lacked the liveliness of a normal girl. According to the girl's statement,

Her Hometown is Suzhou

She was only five years old when she was adopted. Because she could not bear the abuse, she ran away on the 19th of last month and did not steal any items. She is currently living at her sworn sister's house. She asks that Chen give her fifty dollars to cover her current living expenses and does not want to return to Chen's house. Judge Xu then summoned Chen to the case and told her that what Xiuzhen was asking for was only a mere fifty dollars, which was easy to resolve. You might as well fulfill her wish and not get involved in litigation, and litigation also costs money. The woman, hearing this,

Absolutely Refused to Open

her stingy purse, repeatedly saying that she had no money. Judge Xu then persuaded her to reduce the amount to thirty yuan, but the woman still shook her head frequently. The judge then asked her, "How do you have money to hire a lawyer?" The woman said, "The lawyer is helping out." The judge said, "The lawyer is not your relative, how could he be helping out? Moreover, this kind of case has no hope of bearing fruit. This shows that you are too fierce." At this point, Chen's lawyer followed the court's instructions and repeatedly persuaded her. The woman finally

Yielded to Persuasion

and said that she was willing to pay ten yuan and would not increase it any further. Judge Xu saw that the woman was not easy to reason with and could not help but hesitate. The woman's lawyer then stated that he was willing to contribute five dollars. The judge felt that there was still room for maneuver, so he spared no effort to give the woman a final piece of advice, asking her to make up twenty yuan so that the girl could cover her short-term living expenses. The woman still tried to shirk responsibility, but eventually agreed. The clerk then drafted a reconciliation record of their separation, which was signed by the woman, the girl, and both lawyers to close the case.

### Wife Accused of Adultery by Her Husband Tells Her Story

Driven by Livelihood, She Began Cohabiting with Another Man; Husband Was Well Aware of the Matter and Came to Collect Money from Time to Time

Gu Wenbao, a local resident of No. 165 Wenming Road, Nanshi, works at Yuanchanghua Firm, which specializes in selling machine oil. Ten years ago, he married Wu Wenjuan, a woman from Beiping, and they had a son who is now twelve years old. Recently, Gu suddenly reported to the Xinzha Police Station that his wife, Wu Wenjuan, was committing adultery with Xie Hongbiao, a Cantonese man, and living together at No. 80 Qingdao Road. The police station then ordered detective Ruan Yao to investigate and confirmed the facts. Jiang Baolian, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, prosecuted them under Article 239 of the Criminal Law for

Disrupting Family

The case has already been heard once by the First Special Court. Due to hopes of reconciliation, the court ordered a postponement for further hearing. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the case was re-examined by Judge Zhan Liangce in the Second Criminal Court. After the police station lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the intention of the prosecution, Gu Wenbao testified that he had been married to Wu Wenjuan for more than ten years and had a son who was twelve years old. Several years ago, his wife suddenly ran away. After searching everywhere, he could not find any trace of her. It was not until last month that he

Saw Her on the Street

He then secretly followed her and saw his wife enter No. 80 Qingdao Road. He then secretly reported to the police station, etc. Wu Wenjuan stated that she was thirty-two years old, from Beiping, and had been living with Xie Hongbiao for five years. They had a child who was four years old. Her husband was fully aware of her relationship with Xie. After she married Gu Wenbao, Gu did not engage in proper work and did not provide for her. She then became a female employee at Huacheng Tobacco Company. Later, when the business closed, she was forced by livelihood to

Disregard Shame

and became a hostess at Wang Laoer's Yu Shu Zhai in Renmin Heli. At that time, her husband was fully aware of it. She had even asked her husband how to handle it if there were customers. Her husband replied that as long as she gave him money, she could do as she pleased. From then on, her husband came to collect money from time to time, usually three to five yuan at a time. She still maintained her husband's face, and if she encountered customers, she would claim that her husband was a relative. Finally, unable to bear the suffering, she resolutely filed a

Divorce Lawsuit

with the Shanghai Local Court in 1931. Because the conditions were not met, she was sued. When she was at the bookstore, she met Xie Hongbiao, a customer, who learned of her pitiful life. Unable to bear it, he lived with her to maintain her life, which has been five years. Her husband was also fully aware of it. In these years, her husband often waited for her at the small vegetable market to borrow money, or even went to No. 80 Qingdao Road. Because she and Xie lived upstairs, her husband

Dared Not to Go Upstairs

he asked Chen Zhang, a tenant woman, about Xie's whereabouts. If he had gone out, he would ask the woman upstairs to come down. When she came downstairs, she would give him several yuan. Today, Chen Zhang has also come to court, etc. Xie Hongbiao then confessed that he lived with Wu Wenjuan, but did not know that she was a married woman. Chen Zhang, a witness woman, proved that Gu Wenbao had indeed come and asked her to invite Wu Wenjuan

Downstairs to Talk

However, she did not know about the matter of borrowing money. Finally, Gu Wenbao stated that Wu Wenjuan's statements were all false. Since Wu ran away, he had never met her and had never borrowed money from her. During the postponement of the hearing, she had asked him to settle out of court for one thousand yuan, but he refused. He requested a severe sentence. Judge Zhan stated that the case still needed to be investigated and postponed the hearing to a later date.

### New Black Panther Arrives at the City Zoo

The Species is Fierce and Untamed

Currently Temporarily Housed Near the Silk Factory

The black panther purchased by the Municipal Zoo from New Zealand arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. The zoo is currently building a strong iron cage for display. The panther's body is short, small, and powerful, about four feet long and one and a half feet tall. Its fur is black and shiny with colorful spots. It is currently temporarily housed on a pile of sand in a giant fish tank, as it is extremely fierce and untamed. The cage is made of iron bars and wrapped in iron sheets, so it is not easy to see it without permission. The zoo will soon build a strong cage for display to the public. One of the cages originally used to house kangaroos will be reinforced with iron bars and the interior decorated. It is expected to be completed soon. The exact date of formal display has not yet been determined.

### Modern Politics and China (Continued)

â Junshan

Finally, as a result of studying the truth of modern politics, we have fully explained that modern politics has four major trends:

A. From multiple parties to one party;

B. From separation of powers to centralization of powers;

C. From deliberation to dictatorship;

D. From emphasizing the rule of law to emphasizing the rule of people.

These four major trends are issues worthy of study in today's politics. To study today's Chinese politics, we must of course study today's world politics; because in this 20th century, politics, military affairs, and economics are all affected by the world. Therefore, we must study today's world politics before we can study today's Chinese politics. Speaking of this, I can't help but recall Mussolini's criticism of the politics of the founding country of modern democratic politics - the United States. Mussolini said: "Today's United States is a country without politics, because the American people are people without political concepts. Because they only discuss the issue of drinking beer or not drinking beer once every four years. Do these people still have political concepts, political thoughts, and political actions?" We cannot be sure whether Mussolini's words are correct; but let's think about it: the political concept of the people of a country is indeed weak when they only discuss the issue of whether to drink beer once every four years. But when we turn around and look at China, China's situation may be even worse than the United States, because they can still discuss their own pressing issues once every four years, but most of our people don't even know how to discuss - they don't even know what politics is, what is there to discuss? I think: past Chinese politics - maybe even to this day - only has two things: ã want the people's money; ã beat the people's butts. What other relationship is there besides this? It is truly heartbreaking to say! (To be continued)

### After Years of Togetherness, a Sudden Parting: Mother, Daughter, and Sisters Embrace and Weep

Four Conditions Agreed Upon in Court: Severing Family Ties Hereafter

Ms. Shi Xiangyun, a renowned performer of Shanghai-style opera and local resident, is skilled in performing arts at various entertainment venues in this city, as well as excelling in Kunqu opera, enjoying considerable fame. She resides at No. 46, Tongkang Li, opposite the Slaughterhouse Company on Chujia Bridge in the French Concession, a property she owns. Her brother, Shi Qingtang, stage name Xiao Yun, performs Shanghai-style opera. The siblings each have their own distinct style. Qingtang and Wu Lanying collaborate and broadcast on major radio stations in this city. Their father, Shi Xikang, had taken Ms. Leng Feixia from Sichuan as a concubine when he was in Hankou.

She also learned Shanghai-style opera

And performed with Xiangyun and others. She gave birth to a daughter named Lan Shi, who is fourteen years old this year. Xikang passed away last spring. Feixia and her daughter continued to live with Qingtang, Xiangyun, and others. However, after her husband's death, Feixia suddenly became pregnant. In January of this year, she gave birth to twins, both boys, at the China-Germany Maternity Hospital. Both infants were not viable and died shortly after birth. After being discharged from the hospital, Feixia took her

daughter Lan Bao

And rented a place at No. 47, Fuzhi Fang, Beile Road. Shi Qingtang, considering that his father's concubine, Shi Leng Feixia, had behaved improperly by becoming pregnant and giving birth after his death, thereby disgracing the family, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Leng Feixia in the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court, seeking to sever their relationship. The defendant, Leng Feixia, also hired a lawyer to file a defense and a counterclaim demanding property division. The case was heard twice and then

adjourned for out-of-court settlement.

Details of these events have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, Presiding Judge Wu Xiaoke continued the hearing in Civil Division Six. Both parties appeared in court with their lawyers. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the case had been settled out of court through the representatives. They requested the court to draw up a settlement record. Each party added one additional person as a party to the agreement. The plaintiff added Shi Xiangyun, and the defendant added Shi Lanbao. They agreed on

four conditions:

ã Shi Qingtang and Shi Xiangyun will pay the defendants, Shi Leng Feixia and Shi Lanbao, 2,700 yuan for alimony and education expenses. ã The jewelry and property in the safe deposit box at the Four Banks Savings Society previously held by Xikang will no longer be claimed by the defendants. ã After the settlement, Leng Feixia will sever her family relationship with the plaintiffs. ã Lanbao will remain under the guardianship and care of Feixia. The court verified the terms and ordered Feixia to act as Lanbao's legal guardian. The court clerk was instructed to prepare the

settlement record.

The parties and their lawyers signed the record, and the court declared the settlement to be legally binding and adjourned. Shi Lanbao, who had lived with her older sister Xiangyun for many years, was deeply saddened by the sudden separation. Tears streamed down her face. Xiangyun and Feixia, witnessing the scene, could not bear it and embraced each other, weeping with reluctance. They were eventually persuaded by those present and left with tears in their eyes.

### The Head Shopkeeper

â Ai Wu

He was very fat, probably requiring two ordinary people plus several dozen pounds of meat to match his size. His face was the color of purple sugar, extremely full and solid. His voice was exceedingly loud. A simple yawn could startle your ears. His surname was Zhou, but no one ever mentioned it, simply calling him "Head Shopkeeper," both because of his large size and because he ran a large general store.

When calling for a rickshaw, the puller would glance at him and then at the vehicle, worriedly saying:

"I'm afraid it can't hold you?"

He would climb aboard while saying:

"It's alright, I'll sit sideways."

The puller, having no choice, would then ask for more money, to which he would grunt vaguely in agreement. But upon reaching the destination, he wouldn't add a single coin, instead placing his hands behind his back, sticking out his belly, tilting his head, and saying as he walked off:

"You say you're tired? Hmph, I didn't have a pleasant ride either! What suffering, what suffering!"

Upon returning from the streets, he would invariably bellow:

"Bring me something to eat!"

A withered old maid would silently bring him a bowl of braised beef. He would devour it greedily, all the while cursing himself.

"Damn, the poorer I am, the hungrier I get!"

In reality, he was far from poor, owning not only the general store but also several pawnshops. Moreover, the president of the Chamber of Commerce would always remember him when raising funds for the authorities. After his snack, he would shout:

"Where's today's newspaper?"

If no one brought it to him, he wouldn't get angry. He already read the newspaper first thing in the morning, scanning important news such as the rise and fall of grain prices, and was merely using it for leisure at this point. He would read provincial news, national news, and even incomprehensible foreign news, but his criticism after reading was always the same:

"Nonsense!"

Or, he would doze off over the newspaper before finishing it, his nose practically touching the newsprint.

In the general store, his favorite place to sit was between the accountant and the wooden cash counter. The clerks, knowing his habits, would place the extra-large chair made especially for him there. He wasn't there to supervise the accounts or personally manage the money, but because he enjoyed listening to the clerks dropping coins into the cash counter, the sudden clattering sound, and the sound of them telling the accountant things like "Five yuan, change three corners." According to him, this was more interesting than going to the theater to hear men sing in women's voices.

As for banquets for raising funds and the like, he was even less willing to attend. If he was questioned about it later, he would pat his rear and laughingly defend himself:

"What would I do there? ... You don't have a chair for me to sit on!"

He believed that everything in life was fake, and only money earned and held in hand was truly real. But at the age of thirty-five, he suddenly wanted children and took a concubine, but she didn't conceive. At thirty-seven, he took another, but still no children. What was the problem? He couldn't figure it out. Upon turning forty, he grew anxious and finally turned to the gods. Every year in June, when the City God went on procession, he volunteered to help, wiping sweat from his brow while supporting the City God's palanquin through the streets. Because, according to legend, this could indeed produce sons and was a good deed that only required effort and didn't cost much money.

After that, he also engaged in charitable activities. He donated a few dollars to the Red Cross in the provincial capital, buying a badge as a regular member, which he hung on his coat with toothpicks and the like. But when officials from the association came to raise money for medical expenses for wounded soldiers, he angrily cursed:

"Who told them to fight! They're such fools!"

Then, he would become amiable again, speaking a great deal of unimportant words to dismiss the fundraising effort. If the fundraiser was still not sensible enough to leave, he would personally bring out tea, ham, and other items, warmly pointing out to the fundraiser:

"These are top-quality goods, take a sniff, very fragrant! Other stores wouldn't give you this kind. ... Buy some, the price is fair, surely we wouldn't try to profit from an acquaintance?"

The monks in charge of the various temples, knowing that he wanted children, took the opportunity to offer methods. He had previously disliked these people, but now he accepted them very humbly. Because he understood that this was like doing business, requiring multiple calculations. Supporting the City God alone was not enough, but no matter what good methods the monks suggested, it always came down to giving money to the bodhisattvas, such as gilding the large Buddha or buying oil for sky lanterns. What did the head shopkeeper do? He frowned, thought for a moment, and then generously said:

"Bring me the donation book!"

The monks asked him to write himself, but he revealed his thick, strong wrists and declined:

"Look, how can I do that? My writing is shaky, am I supposed to draw snakes?"

The monks asked him how much he was willing to donate, and he strutted his square steps and said generously:

"Whatever you like!"

The monks dared not write too much, only writing fifty days' worth for him. When they asked him to pay, he would walk up to them, pat them lightly, and say as if in private:

"You're so clueless! Old master. How have you lived this long? Does this still require me to pay money? I'm telling you, my name is worth money. You take it and solicit donations now. When people see that I, the Head Shopkeeper, have donated, they'll know it's a very good thing, who wouldn't donate? ... Heh heh, it's not easy to give people my name!"

The burst of laughter at the end would make the other party shudder.

In remote provinces, things are most baffling. When the army needs to move, they tell the people to raise departure fees; when they need to fight, they tell the people to contribute war funds. Therefore, the president of the Chamber of Commerce handed the Head Shopkeeper a slip of paper, saying that he owed twenty yuan. He crumpled the slip of paper into a ball in front of him, almost yelling:

"Hmph, I ask you, what exactly do you do? We elected you to be the president! Not a robber!"

But the president was an old fox and didn't get angry, instead using words to persuade him. He also understood that he couldn't close the store just for twenty yuan, and raising the prices of all goods in the city to recoup the loss would be very easy, so he exceptionally dipped into his own pocket, but was still furious, cursing everyone he met:

"Damn, what's the point of doing this business? It's better to close shop!"

Neighbors on the street had always called him "Head Shopkeeper" to his face, but behind his back they jokingly called him "Big Fatty" or "Meat Archway." Such ridicule about his name was ultimately harmless to him, but when the news of the twenty-yuan donation spread, the new nickname they gave him fully displayed their malice. That was to call him "Soft Edge." "Soft Edge" refers to a turtle, and they believed that it was impossible to get him to move by coaxing. As long as you stepped on its back, it would crawl. Sometimes they didn't call him "Soft Edge," and simply called him "Step On and Crawl." Such situations also happened.

### Father's Hair

â Cheng Zhaoxiang

Having reached my early twenties, not only unable to support a "family" but also spending almost my entire life in worry, I can't help but stare blankly at the trivial things I hear from home.

I don't like to hear people pour out their loneliness, nor do I like to pour out my loneliness to others. But when I discovered that all the joy and hope were too far away from me from some sincere emotions, looking back at myself, I felt truly lonely. We grow up in loneliness: without joy, without hope, only a set of shackles of life grinding us non-stop.

I discovered an even better example, I saw my father's hair, which had been lonely all his life, had turned completely white.

A few years ago, I remembered that his hair was not yet completely white. Once, during a ancestral worship ceremony, when my father bent down to worship, his hair was lifted by a breeze (his hair was a kind of long hair combed backwards after his braid was cut off), and I began to see that what was shining on his head was not black, but silver-like half-white hair, occupying about three-tenths of it. I couldn't help but be silently surprised:

"Ah! Has it become so fast?"

My father, who used to hold my hand and comfort me in many ways to go to school when I was young, was still healthy at that time. Once he held me and lifted his hair - it was completely black, and white hairs were almost impossible to find.

Only fourteen or fifteen years apart, his hair had changed from black to white. In the meantime, we seemed to have not noticed how it turned white - and what flashed before my eyes was a question, what did he do during these years?

Recently, I have occasionally found one or two white hairs in the hair I combed down, and when I held them and looked at them carefully, a little helpless and desolate sorrow arose in my heart.

Here, I also realized the loneliness of our lives from the growth of white hair.

Returning home, in the dawn of the second day, I had such a feeling: in a daze, I habitually heard my father and mother talking about trivial matters at home, from where the money would come from that day to firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and I habitually dreaded listening to these things. However, I had to endure it even if I dreaded listening to it. The sandy voice, with the secondary stress and trembling, relentlessly bombarded my eardrums; it was my father.

"When you get old, you may become a bit talkative!"

I thought. When you get old, you do talk more than others. When my father was in his prime, he was decisive, resolute, and silent, and he never cared about trivial matters at home.

I didn't want to listen to this voice, and with a sighing mood, I buried my head in the quilt.

However, after a while - old, old... the voice shook my heart, and when I poked my head out of the quilt again, I saw half of a hunched figure outside the unfastened window curtains - and his white hair happened to be very clear for me to see.

"Heh heh, so early in the morning, are you pruning the flower trees again?"

As usual, he panted for a while, straightened his back, and bent down again. Half of his life's work was swallowed up by old age, and now he can only entrust his labor to flowers and plants. In the morning sun, I saw his hair trembling in the light into a mess of hemp threads!

So I realized again the reason why white hair climbs onto people's heads. By then, we will still be lonely, and our hair will still turn completely white! Now we have so little that we can't find it.

March 3rd, written in the old house in my hometown.

### That Strange Person

â Long Gonggong

I was very lucky to have met a very strange little train station master. The train station was pitifully small, like a small temple in the corner of a mountain. The first time I saw him was in the winter when it was snowing and raining. He was sitting in the ticket office, his feet resting on a small table. Next to his soaked leather shoes were a bag of peanuts and a bowl of warm yellow wine. The coal stove crackled, and white smoke like spider silk emerged from the crevices. He scolded the peasants who bought tickets. Now there was no one in front of him, so he dozed off in front of the stove. The tenth time I met him, he was still like that...

Constant drool dripped onto the dirty, shiny stain on his uniform. In spring and summer, he would move the sofa to the open space behind the station, where he would sleep all day. In winter - when the wind blew, he would hide in the ticket office and not move at all, drinking yellow wine and waiting for those peasants he thought were both stupid and stingy to come and be scolded.

Now it was winter again, snowing and raining, still in that ticket office. The station bell didn't ring at all. He aimlessly patrolled the room, his ticket machine, and that open window hole with no ghosts in sight, and the hats, thermometers, fire extinguishers, red and green signal flags, and various large and small forms and notices hanging on the wall - all of which were exceptionally familiar and seemed to be of no use at all.

"Okay... but what are you standing here for?"

He patted the red-painted fire extinguisher that hadn't been moved in ten years, as if patting the shoulder of an old friend, and then made a face at the neat, round wall clock like a mischievous child.

The first Sunday of January - but the calendar showed the previous Tuesday... The station master himself knew the year, month, and any day of the week, and never made a mistake, so he was extremely indifferent to things like calendars, just as he knew what his subordinates - clerks, switchmen, porters - did at what time and where their shortcomings lay. ... But now it stopped the station master in his tracks.

This physically strong middle-aged man moistened two of his fingers and started to tear off those calendar pages wolfishly - he sang obscene songs and groaned for no reason, just like he was taking off a woman's clothes.

"That's right - it's Sunday!"

He muttered to himself... "If I treat today as Saturday... do something wrong - that would be so fun!" He took out a toothpick and held it deeply in his mouth, walked to the ticket window, leaned over, and looked outside. The path from the front of the station to the back was damp and lonely. Straw sandals and rubber-soled shoes sparsely imprinted mud marks on it. There were no people or animals - no shadows at all.

I walked behind him - I pushed open the door, there was no sound at all... He had been sticking his face to the window hole for thirty minutes. "Station Master, is the next train coming soon?" He ignored me and continued to stare blankly at the wet path outside.

Every Sunday, when the first train arrived here, a middle school principal named Lin would pass in front of him and simply greet him, "How are you, Station Master?" - It was the station master's only and greatest joy of the week. Today - Sunday, that middle school principal named Lin hadn't come until four o'clock in the afternoon. He had been waiting for him... not knowing at all what I had said to him.

Yes, every Sunday he would block that small ticket window with his strong face... Sometimes others didn't know what he was waiting for...

### Grief Beyond Playfulness

â Feng Zi

(Reading Notes)

The famous reportage writer Egon Erwin Kisch said: "The places and phenomena described by the reportage writer, the experiences he tries, the history he proves, and the sources he explores do not necessarily have to be distant, rare, or difficult for people to approach. In a world that always wants to hide the truth and therefore always finds lies, our writers only need to be able to grasp their subjects. There is nothing more strange than simple truth, nothing richer in exotic scenery than our surroundings, and nothing more beautiful than objective phenomena."

These are words of wisdom, the best lesson for the authors of reportage. After reading Mr. Lu Xiliang's preliminary selection in the eighth issue of Zhongliu, I became even more convinced of the truth of these words.

Kisch once wrote twenty-three segments about our affairs, forming a secret China, which was widely circulated by people who love the truth. However, here, in this ancient country, every day someone is creating lies, covering ugliness with brocade, and decorating chaos with tranquility, so that people cannot see the truth. She has even more secrets, and the author of the preliminary selection has discovered one of these secrets.

The author, using the tone of a township head, tells the story of a preliminary election in a certain county. The vote-buying runners actively woo the township heads. Money, wine, food, positions, gifts, all methods are used, and the township heads have also decided on the people they want to elect. Everything is settled, but when it comes to the election, a clerk from the county government and a soldier escort them to the county magistrate in the Wen Miao Hall. Unexpectedly, the county magistrate glared and said:

"The provincial government issued a secret order last night, asking me to do this! I also think it's inappropriate for you to elect randomly; it's difficult to count the votes and easy to cause disputes. Now we'll follow the provincial government's method, but let me tell you first: the people I've written down are all highly respected in your county. Whoever opposes them is a troublemaker. I won't be polite to troublemakers."

After saying that, the county magistrate wrote four names on the blackboard: the nephew of the military governor, Yang ÃÃ, the younger brother of the military commander, Jiang ÃÃ, the former county magistrate, You ÃÃ, and one who was "neither rich, nor powerful, nor qualified," the peasant Lao Wu. This was to be a puppet, a signboard of justice and fairness. Afterward, he gave instructions before leaving:

"I'm telling you: when you go out, whoever is bribed will be considered to have coveted the bribe; the briber will be considered to have deliberately bribed. Take them to the district together, no discussion, I'll give them one beating and two fines."

"After leaving the election place, the vote-buying runners thought they had fulfilled their agreement and pulled them around to invite them to dinner. But these township heads, intimidated by the county magistrate's instructions and ashamed of breaking their promise, had no choice but to run away."

This story is realistic, and in China, it is still quite remarkable, but the author is able to use a satirical tone to describe it calmly, yet passionately, so that people can feel the power of his pen. This power makes you laugh, but before you can laugh out loud, it immediately makes you serious. This is because what is contained in the author's heart is not playfulness, but grief beyond playfulness. Although the author's name seems unfamiliar, such skilled technique, simple and moving style, is rare in so-called reportage.

However, I think that the last paragraph, writing about the awakening of these township heads, is good, but it is not harmonious with the whole article. The author did not explain Lao Han's background clearly. This character, sandwiched between the peasants, actually said, "...We have the masses, and the masses are power. As long as we lead them, saving the country and the nation will be no problem!" This is somewhat inappropriate. Moreover, the standards that the township heads themselves wanted to elect were not very bright in the first place. Let's look at the self-description of the township head written in the first person:

Initially, I decided on two people on my ballot. One was Principal Wen, who was a friend of my father. His banquets and gifts were more substantial than others. One was Section Chief He, who was a leader in the education field. I wanted to recommend a few primary school teachers to him in the future. I couldn't decide on the other two. It so happened that it was our family's turn to provide a trainee. My younger brother had just graduated from elementary school, how could my father let him be trained? But it was unavoidable. I had to ask Regiment Commander Chen to talk to the chief of the joint village association and tell him not to train or hire someone to be trained. Because hiring someone, you have to give them eight mu of land to settle down! Sure enough, Regiment Commander Chen said it would be fine with just one word. His expression to me was: as long as I voted for him, it would be a thank you. How could I not write his name on my vote, which didn't cost me money! My younger brother was wholeheartedly trying to pass the teacher training institute. The director had clearly said to people: "This time we will select students by vote." My brother's request could not be refused. And the director also agreed to replace my bicycle's tire, so I decided on him again.

A dozen of us coincided. - Of course, they all got their benefits. -

The county magistrate raped public opinion. These township heads realized that they had been sold out, but they didn't realize that they had actually sold themselves out long ago. This state is far from being awakened, and it is inappropriate to write them as a group of "hot-headed" awakened masses.

But apart from that, The Preliminary Selection is still a very good article, especially today - when even the progressive creators are "writing doggerel," it has a serious meaning.

### Two Kinds of Women

â Shuangfei

"The Third Kind of Person" is a way of dividing men into three types; now I divide women into two types:

One type of woman has a rosy complexion, a full figure, and often feels cheerful. This type of woman is called a "healthy and beautiful woman," and they are very capable of participating in society. The other type of woman has a sallow complexion, a thin figure, and often feels depressed. This type of woman is called a "Lin Daiyu-esque woman," and they are relegated to a backward position in society!

The difference between these two types of women is naturally dictated by their environment. Healthy and beautiful women have been cleansed by the new era, so their physique can become strong and healthy. "Lin Daiyu-esque women," on the other hand, are still bound by feudalism, so their physique is weak, even leading to various physiological ailments! Apart from deep sympathy for these women, we hope they can improve their living conditions. If their illness is caused by physical weakness and blood deficiency, we would like to introduce several miraculous women's medicines: "Monthly Red" for promoting menstruation and blood circulation, and "Women's Treasure" for nourishing blood and regulating menstruation. Proper treatment can also cure the diseaseâQiangren.

Commentary

### A Farce

â Tianyu

Japan's new Foreign Minister Mr. Sato, gave a wonderful "equal diplomacy" declaration towards China at the beginning of his tenure, stating that Japan's past mistakes of dealing with China everywhere with a special status, and in the future, it should seek a compromise with China in the spirit of equality. This bold declaration, which had never been heard since the "September 18th Incident," immediately won huge applause from peace lovers at home and abroad. As a result, some of us also thought that Japan's policy had really "turned a corner." However, the reality is not so easy. It seems that after making a bold declaration, Mr. Sato was not so bold after all, or perhaps the voices of opponents had already subtly risen, so within two or three days after the declaration was issued, he successively issued many supplementary explanations. In these supplementary explanations, he emphasized that Japan's national policy has been consistent and has not "turned a corner," and that only the method has changed. We can see that after making a bold declaration, Mr. Sato was quickly trying to gradually take it back. However, despite Sato's keen observation of the situation, and his efforts to dilute the peaceful colors of his declaration to suit the tastes of his opponents, a wave of opposition to his declaration was still spreading uncontrollably. As a result, just four or five days after the declaration was issued, a wave of dissatisfaction arose, and the last sentence was: "Misunderstanding of the situation"! The next request was: the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister should resign together. Sato, who was listening to a lot of applause at home and abroad, was in high spirits, but he was suddenly splashed with a bucket of cold water; and many listeners at home and abroad, whose enthusiastic applause had not yet ended, were followed by a chilling wind, leaving everyone stunned. Such a farcical tragicomedy in the international arena is truly worthy of sighing "it is the limit."

However, this incident is the best lesson for us.

In the past, some of us always believed that people would "return to their senses" one day, which is called "awakening." As the saying goes: "If I always treat people with sincerity, people will eventually treat me with sincerity," which is what it means. However, in fact, a huge national institution, unless it is equal to a machine, can be controlled at will, stopped and started at will. A national institution is not so easy. May I ask: Since the Meiji Restoration of our friendly country, its prosperity has been fundamentally built on military victories abroad. Today, military victories are even more rapid, and it has gained vast lands without any effort. Where can you find such a bargain today? In such a smooth situation where the military chariot is surpassing ancient and modern times, is it actually possible to stop it midway, pat it on the shoulder and say: "Take a break!" Moreover, in today's situation, unless it suddenly encounters a huge obstacle in front, preventing it from advancing at all, and it is forced by the situation to suffer from the pain of wanting to stop but being unable to, let alone when there is no obstacle in front, and it is going very smoothly? Therefore, regarding Sato's farcical tragicomedy, we ourselves can take the opportunity to thoroughly "awaken" and see that unless we quickly throw a bomb at the oncoming chariot, or fire a cannon at it, the chariot will never suddenly stop in front of us midway, and even "stop for a moment" is impossible! Even Sato's "empty promises" speech cannot exist, let alone anything else!

### The Temple of the God of Agriculture

â Youqi

The "Temple of the God of Agriculture" used to be a "forbidden area," used by emperors with the dignity of the ninth five-year plan to perform agricultural ceremonies. Therefore, in the main hall of worship, various agricultural tools were displayed. During the ceremony, it is said that these agricultural tools were "used by the emperor" once every year. The altar site is quite large. There used to be a high wall around it to prevent miscellaneous people from setting foot in it. What happened later? Obstacles like city walls were removed without leaving any trace. This achievement is indeed not small. Whether you are from the north, from the so-called prosperous and somewhat mysterious "Fragrant Factory," or from the west, passing through the "Jiangnan City God Temple" and rushing to the bridge, you can no longer circle along the foot of the wall, and you can directly pass through the forbidden altar.

Then, it became a park, and a few copper coins could give you a good view. The towering pines and cypresses tightly covered the pedestrian path with their branches and leaves, preventing the poisonous face of the sun from hurting the skin of tourists. As soon as you enter the "Second Altar Gate," a cool and fresh breath hits your nose, and your tired mood is also invigorated. We didn't have the eye for what this forbidden area looked like in the past, so we can't know, but the facilities at this time are probably not left over from the past.

Following the uneven tree trunks, there are large "tea sheds" in the dense places, with white tablecloths and rattan armchairs, neatly waiting for ordinary guests. If you have a few cents on you, you might as well sit down. If you are hungry, there are also snacks. Do you want to exercise? There are Earths and other things that you can use to exercise your body. If you want to find a woman to talk to, it's not difficult. Just watch carefully as the women in business slowly stroll through the trees, and when their eyes glance into the tea shed, don't miss this opportunity, go up and strike up a conversation, and then you will easily succeed. If all of this is not for you, if you want to relax your muscles and bones, well, believe your steps and stay in the flower garden for a while. In front of you are unknown miscellaneous flowers and plants, and patterns that have been carefully arranged; look at the rare birds, peacocks, macaques, etc. in the wire cages, and you will also feel a little relaxed.

Entering the third altar gate, there are two "altars" on the left and right of the main path, for some playthings related to heaven, earth, and the five elements that cannot be explained, stone-carved landscapes and "pointing instruments" are placed in a certain direction according to regulations. The dragon-shaped coiled pine lowers its branches into a "dragon claw," almost touching people's heads, and the strong vines climb to the top, winding around like snakes. Climbing to the high altar, the city head of Yongdingmen extends over the embrasure and embraces the outer perimeter of the three altar walls. If it is a windy and cold night, if it is in the deep of the night when there is no one around, the branches and leaves rustle on all sides, and under the dragon-shaped snake-like pine vines, it seems that there are ghosts and monsters, and the city walls silently reveal their terrible teeth like giant demons, and you will feel chills down your spine.

Once, brilliant flowers bloomed here, the "Fragrant Factory" was opened as an amusement market, the girls in the hutongs moved their fragrant nests to new houses built nearby, and the gongs and drums of the amusement center in the south of the city attracted tourists from all over the world. Not far away, there was the "Tianqiao," and every day, groups of people would occupy the tea sheds in the altar so much that they were not enough to distribute!

After that, the fragrant nests were changed to municipal houses, the places to eat and drink were moved to the central area, and the amusement centers that attracted tourists stopped breathing under the strain of tension. At this point, the Temple of the God of Agriculture became desolate.

Originally, this place was close to the south of the city, and it was usually quite remote. Apart from the few streets of the Fragrant Factory, there were few residents nearby. The hot weather was fine, but once it entered autumn, the coldness of the north was quite early. When the autumn wind stirred up the yellow sand on the ground, there were pitifully few tourists in the altar. After the lights were turned on, except for the occasional peddler passing through here, there were almost no pedestrians. At this point, the rumor experts who feared that the world would not be in chaos revealed a message, saying that ghosts and goblins often appeared in this place, with vivid descriptions, which could make people's hair stand on end. Because of this, the fate of the altar was deeply buried by a terrible atmosphere!

In the silent night, I dreamed of the magnificent agricultural altar that had been used by the emperor. Now, the old capital is cast in dim twilight. I haven't seen it for several years, and I'm afraid it has sunk even lower.

### Reflections on Reading Advertisements

â Zhuoren

Recently, a certain dance hall published a huge advertisement for the replacement of the ÃÃÃ band to attract "dance fans," but the next day, the ÃÃÃ dance hall also published an advertisement saying: "The band in this hall has never changed a single person. Someone is using our name to deceive people. We hereby solemnly declare." This kind of advertisement war in the style of "Zhang Xiaoquan's original old store" is already common in Shanghai. However, I am not a "dance fan." Whether it is the "original old store" or "selling dog meat under a sheep's head," I thought of "commercial ethics" because of it.

Doing business is "seeking profit with capital," and it seems excusable to say that your own things are a little better. Except for those who sell bitter gourds, there are no advertisements in the world that don't say "good." However, the best scissors may not be produced by Zhang Xiaoquan, and the pigs slaughtered by Lu Gaojian are also ordinary pigs. However, it seems that opening a scissors store must rely on Zhang Xiaoquan to attract customers, and selling meat must hang a Lu Gaojian sign, or it would be unfair to the "eaters." As a result, people don't know what to do, and even if there are scissors more sharp than Zhang Xiaoquan, and pork more delicious than Lu Gaojian, they are all swept away.

When I read "Commercial English" in the past, I read a very good example: A new barber shop opened across from a barber shop. A customer asked the boss, "How's business?" The boss smiled and replied: "Those who come to our shop are all "upper class people." They only do the business of "peddlers and servants."

He did not focus on the luxurious decoration, comfortable seats, attentive service, and excellent technicians of the "trade," but simply compared "upper class people" with "peddlers and servants." Who would be willing to not be an "upper class person" and be a "peddler and servant"? â This is a very effective advertising technique.

After Mr. Lu Xun passed away, pirated books were everywhere on the market. I bought a pirated "Miscellaneous Essays Collection" for two dimes and eight cents, which was originally priced at four yuan with a 17% discount. However, when I turned to the last page, I saw the eight characters "Copyright Reserved, Reproduction Prohibited." Perhaps the book dealer is a little more clever than other businessmen, and came up with that kind of "dead people can't testify" "humor."

However, the ethics of merchants have been lost!

### Refugee Ship

â Tian Qing

The boundless gray mist swept away the last rays of the setting sun. The evening on the sea seemed so bleak and desolate.

The wind kept blowing on the bugle, churning in the sky. The sea tide was like a naughty child, constantly bouncing, jumping, rejoicing and singing; but it was also like an ambitious politician, vying for superiority and seizing territory: constantly shouting, killing and clamoring.

A lone boat stood precariously, pushed by the waves, constantly overturning and swaying: hundreds of homeless wanderers traveled day and night. Whether they were frail old people, ignorant children, or young and strong people, their hearts were equally cold and desolate. Looking forward, the endless sea and sky, the endless vastness! Looking back, the faces of fierce gods were hung in their hometowns.

The shadow of death hung over everyone's minds. They were not like poets, unable to utter the desolation of the sea at dusk, nor could they sing the poem "The Lone Duck Flies with the Setting Sun." For everything, they only had terror and hatred. They tried to rush up to the sky and crush the sun into powder; because they really hated its poisonous cruelty - the drought tore up the source of their lives: the crops withered into yellow grass, and the seeds rotted together with the scorched mud; the ground cracked into a turtle's back, and even the ancient wells that had been around for thousands of years saw the bottom. The poisonous sun forced everyone to dig up grass roots, peel tree bark, and even eat the flesh of dead people!

The tragic cries under the disaster were indeed like the clamor of the waves.

These waves, this sea, also made them hate and angry; and smeared with extremely strong terror. It was a great harvest year after the drought, and the bitter faces had just regained a little smile; the hope that had been away from them for a long time had also regained a little vitality. But the water, the boundless giant waves, washed away the dikes of the countryside, washed away the safety of their lives: swallowed the lives and property of many people and animals, forcing them to leave the birthplace where their ancestors lived, and step into the vastness.

## Page 18

on the wandering journey, passing through a village, a township, and another county town.

Everyone crossed high mountains, traversed steep ridges, and also crossed winding waters; circled for thousands of miles. It has a little more mobility than the nomadic people. There has not been a peaceful sleep all year round, sweet dreams and reveries have long left them far away, only wandering and famine, hovering beside them all day long.

Wherever they went, they rarely received sympathy and help; they were not allowed to stay for a little longer. It seemed that the world could not tolerate this group of "redundant people." Some busybodies were even more fond of creating many slanderous rumors against them: "The Yellow River Woman" can use closing-eye magic and can draw talismans and chant spells, stealing things without you noticing for a while... They were born with this cheap look, and begging is an ancestral profession; everyone must endure several years of wandering suffering to live peacefully to old age; in their hometowns, they still have whole houses and whole pieces of land...

In this way, the general public became more defensive and hostile towards them, cursing and resenting them. In order to maintain local "peace," they often suffered the treatment of being "escorted" out of the country - adding infinite embarrassment and pain to the lives of those who were displaced and suffering!

Forced off the land and onto the sea, in the vast sea, they did not know where they would set sail?

No one could maintain their mental balance, no one could see their own life clearly, and no one could estimate what life would be like tomorrow? No one in the group knew who would die next?

The night at sea was getting deeper step by step. Under the shroud of dim and miserable fog and the constant attack of waves; the memory of the flood rushing into the village stirred up in everyone's hearts again; this tragic memory made them tremble in terror. Often, because of the overturning and shaking of the ship, it would cause a great, miserable, desperate cry and shout, a request and a prayer - although they were assigned to be "redundant people" in the world, they all cherished their lives very much; they leaned on each other and took care of each other among their companions; people who used to be strangers living in different places have now become closer than their own siblings.

Although they also gave birth on the long journey, it was far from being able to withstand death: the large group of three to four hundred people was left with only a hundred lives - these lives were bound by hunger, cold, and disease, and were approaching death step by step. They could not breathe a sigh of relief, only lamenting the gloom of the world!

The boundless darkness, the heavy miserable fog, combined with the raging wind and waves, made the hearts of the wanderers even more confused!

### Gray Crane

â Zhu Lu

In the ancient northern city, in the emperor's great temple, it is full of solemn relics, the purple-gold courtyard top, the round and thick hall pillars, the old camphor wood armchairs, and on the white stone steps like mutton fat, there are carvings of dragons, symbolizing majesty and tyranny, dancing with claws and teeth.

In the ancient temple, the decorated incense burners and memorial tablets are all protected as antiques. Outside the gloomy main hall, in the thick woods, there is the queen of the sky, a group of gray cranes, flying in the shade of the trees.

In that ancient and quiet atmosphere, only it, a group of gray cranes, represents a group of young people, it has a gray and clever body, gray velvet-like wings, gray head, ... when it is in the golden sunlight, opening its gray-white wings, flying out of the woods, flying in the sky, the sunlight shines on it, it looks so beautiful.

It has a stubborn personality, and flies to the eternally circling woods every year, it will not change to another place, and fly to another place by mistake.

Every year, it flies from the cold and barren wilderness of Siberia, to the ancient city flying with wind and sand, following the example of its ancestors, each time, it only stays in the circle of trees, it loves freedom so much, when people are noisy and disturbing its residence, it will disappear in the clouds.

That circle of woods has been fenced off with iron wire, preventing tourists from running in. When spring comes, and the bright spring light shines, a group of gray cranes appear in the woods, spreading the seeds of spring light in the quiet too temple like being buried in a tomb, singing spring songs in the shade of the trees, such free and exciting songs.

Often, that brave gray crane, twisting its sharp beak, spreading its wings, raising its head, rushes towards the floating clouds, ... the sunlight flashes its beautiful body, ... it flies, bravely flies, ... excitedly rushes towards the brilliant sunlight.

Young master used to wear silk. Today, he is poor and ragged. No heels on shoes. No sleeves on clothes. Who will recruit you with disheveled hair and dirty face? The stomach is not full. No opium to smoke. There is no way to go east and no way to go west. Rack your brains to come up with bad ideas. Clever changes during the day. Try to steal at night. The thief's heart is empty and his body trembles. Afraid of leaking the incident. Turn back and grab the cigarette butt. Making a nest under the gate tower. Waste paper as a quilt. Once the north wind rises. How to spend the cold. Thinking about the past. Suffering is self-inflicted. Regret not throwing yourself into the net. Black rice is anxious. White rice is even more worried. Far-fetched idea clever plan. Tell the story and kowtow. Tears stain the clothes. Snot all over the ground. At this time, he sighs long and lies across the street. He is now yellow and thin. Skin and bones. Looks like a skeleton.

A truly Chinese "good wife and loving mother" type of woman marries a lazy and alcoholic husband. Since her husband is not promising, in addition to fulfilling her pitiful obligation as a woman to give birth to a large group of children, she also has to work hard and rely on her own hands to support the family, buy wine for her husband, and sew and mend clothes for her children. In this miserable life, her youth is gone, her hair turns white, and her husband breathes his last breath, and everything is over. The children grow up. The sons marry and the daughters are wed, and as a result, everyone happily enjoys their youth. An old white-haired mother with a crowd of children becomes a wanderer, homeless, and has no choice but to spend the rest of her days in an orphanage. - The giant film "Song of a Loving Mother" by Lianhua Company depicts such a story.

This is naturally a tragedy of ethics, but we might as well say it is the traditional tragedy of Chinese women. Now "Song of a Loving Mother" will be released at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater in Shanghai. I wonder, in addition to being moved to tears, what other feelings do the audience have?
