Original Text of Wang's Opening Address

Distinguished comrades, the Third Plenary Session, which the people of the entire nation and all party comrades have been eagerly anticipating, has begun today. Looking back to July of last year, the Second Plenary Session, based on the declaration of the Fifth National Congress, solemnly declared the policy of saving the nation and ensuring its survival, and followed it up with earnest implementation. Consequently, the peaceful unification of the country saw significant progress, and the remaining bandits who had fled to the Northwest were increasingly weakened and approaching elimination. Then came the Suiyuan campaign, where the central leadership's guidance was effective, the local authorities performed their duties diligently, the armed comrades fought bravely, and the people of the entire nation rallied together to provide support, resulting in the achievement of defending our territory and resisting the invaders. In the midst of this crisis of survival, our compatriots and comrades found a glimmer of hope, which increased their boundless courage. However, the Xi'an Incident occurred, which almost caused the foundation of saving the nation and ensuring its survival to be severely shaken, and almost caused that glimmer of hope for our compatriots and comrades to return to illusion. Fortunately, Comrade Chiang Kai-shek emerged safely from danger, and fortunately, the order in Xi'an was restored and could be resolved peacefully according to the central government's plans. This unfortunate event revealed the powerful unity of the people of the entire nation and the composure and courage of all party comrades, who were able to remain calm in the face of change and quell the turmoil before it could erupt. Today, on the opening day of the Third Plenary Session, looking back, we can truly feel gratified. However, the national crisis is severe and continues to worsen. How to recover the lost territories and how to defend the territories that have not yet been lost are issues that require our continued efforts. How should we exert all our strength to save the nation from peril? This is the central problem of all our work. Furthermore, with the Xi'an rebellion newly quelled, hidden worries remain. How should we seek progress in unification and stability, so as not to frustrate the national defense plans of the past few years, and especially not to let the bandit suppression efforts of the past few years fall short? This is also a pressing issue to be resolved. Moreover, saving the nation and ensuring its survival depends on strengthening national power, and strengthening national power depends on increasing the strength of the people. How should we engage in national economic construction movements to alleviate the people's suffering and improve their lives, so that their abilities are revitalized and their effectiveness is increased? This issue is not only related to saving the nation and ensuring its survival in the present, but also to the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Furthermore, the slogan of uniting sincerely and facing the national crisis together since the September 18th Incident not only applies to the entire party, but also extends to the entire nation. The central government has repeatedly resolved to convene the National Assembly, and the reason lies in this. Regarding the date of the National Assembly, it has been delayed due to the incomplete elections in various regions. How should we establish a political system based on the Principle of People's Rights and complete the task of national construction? This is also a pressing issue to be resolved. The Third Plenary Session will review the past, examine the present, and determine the future direction of work. There will certainly be many extremely important proposals and extremely important resolutions in the session. Today, I have only given one or two examples, but it is already evident how significant the mission and responsibility of the session are. We deeply feel the magnitude of the mission and responsibility of this session. On the opening day, with our enthusiasm, we swear to the Prime Minister to make unremitting efforts to shoulder this great mission and responsibility. We rely on the spirit of the Prime Minister in heaven to guide us, so that we may obtain an accurate direction for our future work, so as not to fail the expectations of the people of the entire nation and all party comrades.

Compared to 1933, when there were only 2,700 societies with over 540,000 members, there has been considerable progress recently. Finally, he stated that cooperative societies ㊀ can unite the scattered and disorganized masses into solid groups to exert external power, ㊁ people voluntarily organize cooperative societies and manage them themselves, which can gradually cultivate their ability for self-governance, thereby having educational and training functions, ㊂ cooperative societies do not aim to make money but focus on serving their members, thus raising social moral standards, ㊃ exploitative phenomena in society can be eliminated, and economic inequality can be gradually transformed into equality.

### Deng Qingyang Talks About the Rice Shortage in Guangdong Province

[Nanjing] Central Committee member Deng Qingyang said that the current rice shortage in Guangdong Province is unprecedented. The reason is that rice production in the province only supplies about 30% of the province's population's food needs, relying on rice from other provinces and foreign rice from Annam and Siam for about 70%. The central government stipulates that imported foreign rice is subject to taxation, so foreign rice has disappeared, and rice prices have skyrocketed. Currently, one yuan can only buy seven catties, and rice grabbing is rampant, which has a significant impact on local security. Although the central government recently has regulations for collecting half taxes, this is not a fundamental solution, because the price of foreign rice is not low, and even with half taxes, merchants still have no profit to gain and are unwilling to proceed. Xiang rice is transported to Guangdong, but due to high transportation costs and regular taxes, stagnation has occurred. In recent months, the first batch of Yangtze rice, about 100,000 piculs, has been transported to Guangdong, but the rice grains are extremely inferior, and the price is not low, which provides no remedy for the rice shortage in Guangdong Province. This issue has to be raised for discussion and decision at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in order to find a fundamental solution to relieve the rice panic in Guangdong.

### New Developments in International Aviation

— Xing

After a long period of preparation and successful flight tests, scheduled trans-Pacific aviation between China and the United States will begin around March 34th of this year. U.S. Postmaster General Farley (a confidant of President Roosevelt) has already announced the Pacific airmail postage rates. Now, there is no place on the surface of the world that is not surrounded by scheduled air routes. What is even more noteworthy is the signing of the agreement for Pan American Airlines to use the Hong Kong airfield. Hong Kong is the most important aviation base for the British Far East and the hub of the British Imperial Airways route. Under normal circumstances, the two major rival airlines, British and American, would never sign such an agreement. In 1936, the British Imperial route extended to Hong Kong, and the American Pan American route extended from Manila to Hong Kong. Furthermore, the China National Aviation Corporation connected Shanghai and Hong Kong. In the troubled Far East, the air routes of China, Britain, and the United States are connected in Hong Kong. This is not only a new record in the history of science and transportation but also an important event in the history of world politics and diplomacy.

The past year has truly been a year of great activity and progress in the aviation industry. Whether in the opening of air routes, the manufacturing of aircraft, air safety, or flight speed, there have been unprecedented records. The United States has created large aircraft with 1,100 horsepower. The German zeppelin Hindenburg carried over 1,000 passengers on ten trips across the Atlantic last year. The United States, which has the most developed civil aviation, had one million air passengers in one year. The number of aircraft accidents has been reduced to a very low level, with an average of one accident per 13 million miles of flight. The speed of aircraft and the amount of mail have broken previous records. In European countries, due to the dense war clouds, the aviation industry focuses on military aviation. The number of bombers and fighters has increased, and their efficiency has improved. Although this is not a blessing for civilization, it cannot be considered progress from the perspective of the aviation industry itself.

When the first successful crossing of the English Channel occurred, the world was amazed and shocked. At that time, a speed of 40 miles per hour was already astonishing. Who would have thought that the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean would be conquered by monsters of gasoline and steel in just a few decades? Recently, a British engineer announced that in the near future, aircraft speeds could increase to 700 miles per hour, and Shanghai to Nanjing could be reached in 20 minutes. If we base this on the speed of past progress, this prediction is by no means a fantasy or wishful thinking. Science has given us such great victories. We have a way to conquer any space and time. Carrying Mount Tai across the North Sea is not an impossible thing.

We are not only excited and optimistic about the start of scheduled trans-Pacific aviation, but we are also ashamed and in crisis because of it. In the past few years, the Chinese nation has had considerable enthusiasm for the aviation industry. Aircraft have given us a lot of help in military, transportation, and political affairs. However, what contributions have we Chinese made to the opening of international air routes and to the research of flight technology and aircraft manufacturing? The two airlines we have established by borrowing foreign capital and foreign talent have achieved very low results. According to the latest announcement from the Ministry of Transportation, the number of aircraft accidents is still very high, indicating that our aviation equipment has not yet reached a general standard. The lack of widespread aviation knowledge is even more undeniable. Now, the situation in the Pacific will undergo further changes due to the soaring of iron birds. Large aircraft, such as the Eastern Clipper, are already flapping their wings in the vast sky of the ancient country. What kind of vigilance should we have? How should we quickly catch up and stay ahead?

### Japanese Parliament Reopens, Foreign Minister Hayashi Announces Policy

New Understanding of China, Good Atmosphere at the Meeting

[Tokyo] The Japanese Parliament reopened today in fine weather, which seems to contain a good omen. The House of Peers convened this afternoon. After Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro delivered a speech, Foreign Minister Hayashi, in his capacity, briefly reported on foreign policy. Hayashi's speech is worth noting because it differs from those delivered by previous foreign ministers. In particular, Hayashi did not mention the Hirota Three Principles at all. Hayashi's foreign policy report stated, "At this time, cultivating friendly feelings between China and Japan and improving relations between the two countries through mutual cooperation to achieve stability in East Asia is an urgent task," indicating that Japan has a new concept of China compared to before. Hayashi also stated, "Therefore, China and Japan should understand each other's positions. Not only should the governments do so, but the people of both countries should also have closer contact in order for Sino-Japanese cooperation and mutual assistance to achieve concrete success," which is sufficient to show a glimpse of the recent psychology of the Japanese government and public. The influence of Finance Minister Yuki on the establishment of the Hayashi Cabinet's China policy seems to be considerable. Sakatani Yoshiro raised questions at the House of Peers meeting, apparently urging the government to clarify its attitude towards North China, stating that the Chinese people suspect that Japan's continental policy is to invade North China, with the result that Japan's sincerity has not been thoroughly understood by people. Therefore, the diplomatic authorities should make more efforts in this regard. Prime Minister Hayashi immediately replied that Japan does not want to invade North China and will do its best to dispel misunderstandings whenever there is such an opportunity. The general feeling in the House of Peers was satisfaction with Hayashi's reply. The House of Representatives convened in the afternoon, slightly later than scheduled, because Hamada requested to deliver a speech to clarify his previous debate with Terauchi, but it was not achieved after consultation with various parties. Prime Minister Hayashi and Finance Minister Yuki's speeches were met with applause from the audience, which was completely different from the situation on January 21 under the Hirota Cabinet. Hayashi's political ability is truly different from Terauchi's. Regarding diplomacy towards China, Uehara, representing the Seiyukai party, raised questions, asking whether the government should express in a sincere and effective manner that Japan has no intention of invading Chinese territory and whether the government should adopt a new concept of the development of the national significance of the Chinese people. Prime Minister Hayashi replied that Japan has not only repeatedly expressed that it will not invade China, but will further express this whenever there is an opportunity. I fully sympathize with you in thinking that it is necessary to recognize the new situation in China, etc. This point may be considered the most important point of Hayashi's parliament today.

When Prime Minister Hayashi replied to Uehara's question on how to abolish diversified diplomacy, he promised to do his best to unify diplomacy. Regarding domestic affairs, parliamentarians raised sharp questions about the so-called unique constitutionalism, the reasons for Ugaki Kazushige's failure to form a cabinet, and Hayashi's insistence that members of political parties must renounce their relationship with political parties when inviting them to join the cabinet. Although Hayashi's answers were not convincing, the parliamentarians did not launch further attacks.

Finance Minister Yuki's reply was the most frank and straightforward. In one passage, he said that I am merely acting as Finance Minister for now, and various policies are being determined. I do not expect you to be satisfied with this, but I ask you to give me sympathetic understanding. After Yuki finished speaking, the parliamentarians applauded continuously and whispered, "Yuki's sincere attitude is enough to pass the examination of cabinet members."

Afterwards, Kawasaki of the Minseito party raised questions, saying that the huge military expenditure has led to soaring prices. Can the Ministry of the Army, in view of this, reduce military spending by 23 million yen? Army Minister Sugiyama Gen solemnly declared in his reply that the Soviet Union's increased military preparations in the Far East have forced Japan to expand as well, and he hoped that parliamentarians would have a deeper understanding of national defense. The audience greeted him with cold laughter but also applauded, indicating that they were wary of inciting unrest.

In short, judging from the situation at today's meeting, the political parties have no intention of provocation, and political disputes are unlikely to occur. However, we must pay attention to the fact that the Hayashi Cabinet's policy towards China tends to moderate the emotions of the Chinese people. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)

### Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hayashi Senjuro

### Full Text of Foreign Minister Hayashi's Speech

Promote Sino-Japanese Understanding, Stabilize the Overall Situation in East Asia

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hayashi, in his capacity as Prime Minister, delivered the following speech as Foreign Minister:

I am here in my capacity as Minister of Foreign Affairs to present my views. The government attaches importance to international justice, ensures the stability of East Asia, realizes the common prosperity of all nations as its goal, implements a unified national foreign policy, and seeks clarity in international relations. Therefore, it has a friendly and inseparable relationship with "Manchukuo" and must further consolidate it. As for China and the Soviet Union, it is especially necessary to carefully adjust their relations. Japan has always worked with China to ensure the stability of East Asia, but the Chinese side has not fully understood the true intentions of the Empire, resulting in various problems between the two countries, which is truly regrettable. Therefore, the people of both countries should henceforth harmonize their emotions and seek to clarify their diplomatic relations, join hands, and strive to achieve stability in East Asia. The most important thing is to strive to understand each other's positions. Not only should the government do so, but it is especially necessary to stimulate contact between the people to promote the practical achievements of Sino-Japanese cooperation and assistance. At the same time, if there are any obstacles, they should be removed. With this awareness, we are determined to adjust the diplomatic relations between the two countries. Secondly, regarding relations with the Soviet Union, let me briefly state here that for the sake of peace in the Orient, the Federation must properly recognize the position of the Empire of Japan in East Asia and strive for mutual harmony between the two countries, which goes without saying. Therefore, we will promote the friendly resolution of various pending issues between the two countries in order to be consistent with the above objectives. I hope that the Soviet authorities will continue to assist from the perspective of the overall situation. As for the anti-communist agreement that was concluded with the German government, the communists in the recent world, especially in East Asia, have been quite active. Therefore, the Empire of Japan, which has the responsibility to stabilize East Asia, has no choice but to take this measure, which is very timely. The government will not misuse the implementation of this agreement and should do its best to achieve its full effect. The Empire of Japan must further consolidate its friendly relations with its two major allies, Britain and the United States. This policy has never changed. There are still various issues between Britain and Japan that need to be adjusted, but they do not harm the fundamental nature of Anglo-Japanese friendly relations. I believe that they can be adjusted without a doubt after mutual understanding between the two countries.

As for the naval disarmament issue, the Empire of Japan has been outside the treaty since this year, but it insists on the policy of non-threat and non-aggression. There has been no change in its past attitude, which goes without saying.

Finally, striving to expand foreign trade is an indispensable requirement for the development of the Empire, and judging from the current economic situation in our country, it is even more urgently needed. The government should make every effort to remove trade barriers and strive to promote appropriate trade facilities.

When implementing the above policies, the expected results cannot be achieved without the unified strength of the entire country. Therefore, I still hope that you will assist us, which is what I earnestly hope for. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 15th)

### Prime Minister Hayashi's Policy Speech

Revere the Gods and Honor the Emperor, Revitalize Industry

[Tokyo] The House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:00 AM this morning. Prime Minister Hayashi took the stage to deliver a policy speech. The main points are as follows:

The change of cabinet occurred during the 70th parliamentary session, so the parliament continued to adjourn and recess, resulting in wasted days for the parliamentarians, which is very regrettable. The new cabinet's policy framework was announced on the 8th of this month. Regardless of any cabinet, it is based on the essence of the national polity and realizes the ideals of the founding of the nation. This is the basis of governance. Therefore, the current cabinet will also strive to clarify the clear manifestations of the concept of the national polity, and the great righteousness of revering the gods and honoring the emperor goes without saying. To revitalize industry, it is necessary to adapt it to the internal and external economic situation and implement protective industrial equipment and appropriate control. For this purpose, the creative power and entrepreneurial spirit of the people should not be delayed, but should be further assisted. The new cabinet is based on this grand policy, considering the realization of a new round of general administration of long-standing pending issues and stabilizing the people's lives. Therefore, it is willing to implement fair politics and reforms suitable for the times. The new cabinet, because it was established during the parliamentary session, withdrew the budget and legal bills submitted by the previous cabinet for further review. However, due to time constraints, it was not possible to fully review them. Therefore, regarding the budget, in view of the urgency of stabilizing the people's lives and suppressing the trend of rising prices, we intend to stop using a portion of its surplus, which amounts to approximately 270 million yen. However, the new cabinet hopes to realize various policies adapted to the times and will pay close attention to the policies planned by the previous cabinet to ensure that there are no obstacles in the implementation of these policies. In order to enrich the national defense and prepare military and implement other urgent matters, there is no other way to supplement the revenue deficit except by increasing national taxes. Therefore, it has been decided to temporarily increase the tax rate of the existing tax system and implement some new taxes. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 15th)

### Finance Minister Yuki's Financial Speech

National Defense Industry, Both Planned and Considered

[Tokyo] The main points of Finance Minister Yuki's financial speech are as follows:

There is no time to reorganize the general budget for revenue and expenditure in 1937, so we will submit the one that was previously withdrawn. Regarding the number of accusations, I will explain it again, so I will omit it here. However, the government believes that it is not suitable for the actual economic situation to continue to follow the general budget, so it is necessary to make considerable changes. Judging from the current internal and external situations, the urgent need to enrich and implement the national defense military is beyond words. From this point of view, seeking the development of industry and the progress of trade is also an urgent task at present. However, the stability of the people's lives cannot be ignored either.

Regarding national debt, it is believed that a considerable amount can still be digested by issuing it based on Japan's current national economic power. The increase in taxes has a great impact, so we must strive to prevent adverse effects so as not to shrink the entrepreneurial spirit or reduce productivity. Therefore, the government will suspend the use of approximately 269 million yen of the 3.385 billion yen in expenditure for the year 1937 within the year. Regarding the budget for revenue, due to lack of time, we will temporarily establish a tentative plan today. According to this plan, the increase in revenue is due to an increase in temporary taxes of 233 million yen, the creation of new taxes of 39.2 million yen, and the amendment of customs duties of 22.5 million yen, totaling an increase of 292

## Page 8

14 million yen. Regarding the adjustment of local finance, 70 million yen will be delivered to villages and towns in 1937 to reduce their burden. Regarding interest rate policy, we will avoid artificial means and adopt a gradual approach to attract low interest rates, that is, the control of financial institutions, and we will not adopt drastic means, but will gradually guide them to give full play to their functions. The recent temporary emergency measures for foreign exchange will be continued for the time being to observe their progress. Naturally, in the actual operation, we must pay full attention to it to avoid hindering industry and trade. The recent rise in prices in Japan is due to speculative false demand, which is undoubtedly fueling the situation. However, the rapid increase in the budget is also the reason, which cannot be denied. Therefore, the government is striving to prevent the bulging of expenditures. However, if artificial means are used to deal with rising prices, the opposite result will often occur, so it is considered necessary to study fundamental countermeasures. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 15th)

### House of Representatives Questioning Situation

[Tokyo] After Finance Minister Yuki's financial address concluded, Member of the Seiyukai Party, Matajiro Koizumi, ascended to the podium to begin the first round of questioning. He began by questioning the application of constitutional politics, quoting Prime Minister Hayashi's policy statement. He raised the following points: If Japan's constitutional politics are to flourish, the power of political parties is paramount. It is a grave error to merely point out the flaws of political parties and attempt to exclude them.

Koizumi also asked why Prime Minister Hayashi had required those entering the cabinet to leave their parties when he formed his cabinet. He reiterated that a unified, independent diplomacy was most important. Finally, he advocated for respecting public opinion, arguing that freedom of speech is the foundation for expressing the will of the people.

Prime Minister Hayashi's response was as follows:

㊀ The fundamental concept of implementing constitutional government is to strictly adhere to our country's unique constitutional politics and our country's inherent constitution.

㊁ Requiring party affiliation was deemed appropriate under the circumstances.

㊂ Regarding the implementation of diplomatic policy, I believe that unity between the government and the opposition, both civilian and military, is necessary to achieve results. This embodies the practical achievements of so-called national diplomacy.

㊃ Revitalizing general affairs is also included in the budget for the Showa 12th year. I hope that opportunities to realize this will be seized in the future.

㊄ Regarding financial problems, balancing the national burden is paramount. The delayed implementation of the equalization tax system is also intended to correct the burden's imbalance as much as possible.

㊅ I share the sentiment of respecting freedom of speech.

Next, Etsujiro Uehara, a member of the Seiyukai Party, represented the party in the second round of questioning. His statement was as follows:

The one ordered to form the cabinet, regarding the selection of state ministers, quietly awaits the recommendation of the three chiefs of staff of the army and navy. However, for members of political parties, leaving the party is a condition for entering the cabinet. What is the basis for this? On the one hand, you say you respect parliamentary politics, but in reality, isn't this disregarding political parties? As for implementing diplomatic national policy, a policy toward Manchuria should be established, and policies toward China and the Soviet Union should be determined to stabilize East Asia and establish an anti-communist pact in the Orient. We believe these four items are necessary to implement. What are the views of the Foreign Minister?

Prime Minister Hayashi replied:

The requirement of leaving the party was deemed appropriate given the circumstances at the time and is by no means intended to disregard political parties. Diplomacy should be carried out in cooperation with all parties to ensure accuracy. I fully agree with the various policies toward Manchuria, China, and the Soviet Union, as well as the anti-communist pact.

A wave of laughter erupted from the audience, with many saying, "Agree with everything." Prime Minister Hayashi then descended from the stage amidst the laughter.

Next, Katsushi Kawasaki of the Minseito party questioned Finance Minister Yuki on financial matters, stating that military spending was too high, accounting for 49% of the total budget. Although expanding armaments is a worldwide trend, national defense must be based on a sound financial foundation. Otherwise, there is no security to speak of.

As the audience listened quietly, Toyokichi Tajima suddenly disrupted the proceedings, intentionally obstructing order. He was eventually ordered to leave the chamber. Kawasaki continued his questioning, stating that 23 million yen of the army and navy budgets could not be implemented. He asked if the two ministers had any intention of economizing.

Finance Minister Yuki replied that some items in the budget had been delayed, while others had been reduced. The expansion of armaments was unavoidable. National defense is the shield of the nation, so we should cooperate to overcome the times. The extent to which government bonds are absorbed depends not only on the nation's savings capacity but also on the people's trust in the national finances and their hope for the future of government bond policies.

After Finance Minister Yuki left the stage, Prime Minister Hayashi made a customary reply according to the rules. Then, Army Minister Sugiyama replied, stating that compared to the Soviet Union's forces in the Far East, the Imperial Japanese Army's forces stationed in Manchuria were the minimum required. He asked for understanding. If the budget is deemed excessive and must be reduced, how can our country's defense against the Soviet Union be realized? He urged the members of the Diet to change their understanding of the urgency of national defense. Katsushi Kawasaki reiterated that he respected Finance Minister Yuki's frank reply, but Army Minister Sugiyama may have misunderstood. He stated that if the nation is in a necessary situation, even if the entire budget is used for military spending, he would not hesitate. He had already made this decision, but now is not the time. The Manchurian Incident expenses are necessary to maintain security in Manchuria, and he believed that it might be possible to reduce them. If the army truly seeks to achieve the great goal of national defense, he hoped they would adopt a cooperative attitude.

Commerce and Industry Minister Godo made her debut speech, stating that regarding raw materials policy, she was determined to make every effort to ensure the smooth import of important raw materials such as pig iron and oil. The session adjourned at 5:48 PM. (Allied News Service, 15th)

### House of Peers Questioning Situation

[Tokyo] After Prime Minister Hayashi concluded his speech at the plenary session of the House of Peers, questioning began. In the first round, Chifuyu Watanabe took the podium and said that she had submitted questions to the Hirota Cabinet on its policy direction on January 21. It was a great pity that she was unable to get a reply due to the sudden resignation of the Hirota Cabinet. She wanted to question not only the Hirota Cabinet at the time, but also the points it held. Her feelings for the Hayashi Cabinet were the same, so she hoped to get a reply at an appropriate opportunity. Then she stated the gist of the questions she asked Prime Minister Hirota on January 21, and then asked simple questions:

㊀ While advocating Sino-Japanese friendship, there has been recent anti-propaganda regarding Sino-Japanese friendship. Isn't this the result of the failure to establish diplomacy toward China?

㊁ How is European Fascism considered unsuitable for Japan?

㊂ What is your belief in moral education? Prime Minister Hayashi took the podium and replied that diplomacy toward China had been seen in the diplomatic speech and would proceed with clear diplomacy. The political form in the second point would always be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. In the third point, moral education, he planned to emphasize both moral and intellectual education. After speaking, he left the podium. Next, Yoshio Sakatani took the podium to question.

Sakatani questioned the tax increase problem, saying that the previous tax increase required establishing a ten-year financial plan. Although this tax increase reached a considerable amount, there was no other plan. The Finance Minister should consider the impact of this tax increase on the economic world and establish a future plan. Next, he questioned diplomatic problems with China and the Soviet Union.

Foreign Minister Hayashi took the podium to reply that diplomacy with the Soviet Union, such as fishery treaties and other pending issues, should be resolved satisfactorily with a spirit of mutual concession. The border issue in Mongolia is being negotiated between the Soviet Union and Manchuria. The Imperial Government plans to strive for good results. Relations with China will be adjusted. Regarding armaments, he plans to avoid unnecessary competition and proceed within the scope permitted by finance.

Next, Finance Minister Yuki took the podium to reply to the tax increase problem, saying that the tax increase should not have a significant impact on the economic world and national life, and should not cause price increases and the deterioration of international lending and borrowing. He has repeatedly conducted thorough research on the budget of the previous cabinet, but time was running out, so he reduced and revised 270 million yen to compile the budget, but it cannot be said to be sufficient. Although the tax increase has been fully studied and revised to some extent, the tax increase increases the national burden, which is a pity. However, he hoped that the government's intention would be understood at this time and to be patient.

Sakatani took the podium again and said that tax increases must have a purpose. What is the purpose of the Hayashi Cabinet's 300 million yuan tax increase? He does not understand. For what purpose is the tax increase of 300 million to increase the burden on the people? The Finance Minister took the podium to reply that the tax increase was unavoidable in view of the domestic and foreign situation, the enhancement of national defense, and the stability of national life. The meeting adjourned at 11:50 am. (Allied News Service, 15th)

### Seiyukai Innovation Movement

President Suzuki is Poised to Retire

[Tokyo] The advisors of the Seiyukai are concerned about the recent internal conflicts of the Seiyukai. They are determined to break old habits and stand on their own to consider good solutions. On the 14th, a meeting of all advisors was held to exchange views on ㊀ the party's internal innovation movement, ㊁ the new party movement, and ㊂ the retirement issue of President Suzuki. As a result, the opinions of the people were consistent. It was recognized that the reason for the occurrence of the innovation movement within the party or the organization of a new party movement was that President Suzuki had been ill for a long time and could not personally lead the entire party. Therefore, the discussion was centered on the issue of Suzuki's retirement. Since President Suzuki's condition is now absolutely impossible to recover, it would be a loss to the country for the Seiyukai to advance with a sick president. Therefore, there is a strong argument for Suzuki's immediate retirement. As for the method of his retirement, there are three opinions: ㊀ Take appropriate measures and petition President Suzuki to retire immediately; ㊁ Wait until the end of the Diet session to realize the retirement in order to avoid internal disputes within the party during the Diet session; ㊂ Or explain the current situation to Suzuki and request his voluntary retirement. However, after discussion, no specific method could be decided. It was agreed to hold meetings at any time in the future to discuss this issue. The meeting adjourned at around 10 o'clock. (Allied News Agency, 15th)

### Spanish Rebel Cruiser Bombards Valencia

Large Squadron of Aircraft Attacks Madrid; Spanish Foreign Minister Denies Redization

Valencia - A cruiser belonging to the rebel army fired into the port from the sea off this port this evening, firing for a total of fifteen minutes. Ten shells exploded in the city center, and the number of casualties is not yet known. 80,000 members of the Republican, Socialist, and Communist parties in this city recently held a demonstration, advocating that all anti-fascist parties should unite and submit a resolution to Prime Minister Caballero authorizing the Prime Minister to take all measures to win the final victory of the war. In addition, 15,000 refugees from the southern port of Malaga have arrived here via the port of Almeria. (Havas, 15th)

Madrid - A large squadron of aircraft belonging to the National Army carried out an aerial attack on this city this afternoon. Government aircraft immediately took off to intercept them, and it is reported that two National Army aircraft have been shot down, but this news has not yet been confirmed. (Havas, 14th)

[New York] - Spanish Foreign Minister Val today replied to a telegram from Howard, editor of the New York World Telegram, saying that the Spanish left-wing government is not communist in nature, but since proletarian groups now have great power, there is no doubt that the Spanish capitalist system will change after the government forces win. The claim that Spain has been redized is a deliberate slander and an excuse for conspiracy interference. Supporters of the government forces range from Basque Catholics to anarchist parties. Although their sentiments and thoughts are inconsistent, it is not necessarily the case that they want to form a proletarian government after the government forces win. On the contrary, it can be predicted that they will continue to maintain a democratic republic and further promote the social system. (National Telegraph, 15th)

### New League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig

[Geneva] - Since the League of Nations' High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig, Lester, was promoted to Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations, the Council decided to appoint Lieutenant General Muggrath, former Chief of Naval Staff of the Netherlands, as his successor at its meeting last month. However, Teggrath firmly declined the position. The League of Nations has now decided to appoint Dr. Zikhart, a professor of history at the University of Geneva, as the High Commissioner, and has sought his opinion on the matter. (Havas, 14th)

### Balkan Pact Athens Conference

The Little Entente Will Also Hold a Meeting

Athens - The permanent political conference of the Balkan Little Entente will be held here shortly. The entire city has been decorated with flags to celebrate. The Foreign Ministers and representatives of Turkey, Romania, and Yugoslavia arrived here today and were warmly welcomed along the way. It is reported that the important items on the agenda include the new agreement between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, which will be recognized by other countries to show that the unity of the Balkan Peninsula countries is becoming more and more stable. (Central News Agency, 15th)

Bucharest, Romania - It has been learned that the permanent political conference of the Little Entente will be held on an ad hoc basis at the beginning of next month in the capital of the Czech Republic. This was initiated by the Czech government. The purpose is to enable Romania, the Czech Republic, and Yugoslavia to consider the recent international incidents and study the general political situation. According to the Romanian government, although it has always expressed that it has no intention of interfering with the Czech and South countries, a large part of Romanian public opinion, in view of the increasingly close relationship between the Czech Republic and the Soviet Union, the recent establishment of a friendship treaty between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, and the improved relationship between Yugoslavia and Hungary, is quite uneasy.

### Austrian Chancellor Suggests Cooperation with the Socialist Party

And Makes the Same Request to the National Socialist Party, Saying that Propaganda for Restoration Should Have Limits

[Vienna] - Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg addressed a gathering of 1,500 representatives of the "Fatherland Front" today, lasting for two hours. The most important point was the declaration on the restoration of the Habsburgs. Schuschnigg said that he was the only leader of Austria and that he would decide the future of the country. Regarding the issue of the restoration of the imperial family and the enthronement of Archduke Otto, Schuschnigg said that Austria's attitude should be clarified to avoid misunderstandings. Although Austria respects historical traditions, the issue of the imperial family can only be decided by the Austrian people in accordance with their constitution, and this does not require experimentation. The propaganda for the restoration should be limited to the current Austrian boundaries and borders. The nation and the nation's leader must decide the time to allow the Austrian people to make a decision on this issue. Schuschnigg also attacked the royalists for making extravagant social demands for labor, displaying the various rights that the royalists have already promised. Schuschnigg had no intention of recognizing them, but Schuschnigg also made a warm request to the socialists to cooperate with the government. Schuschnigg also made the same request to the National Socialist Party, but declared that this was his last request to them. As for the danger of communism in Austria, he denied it. Schuschnigg's speech above proves that he is extremely indifferent to the current restoration movement in Austria. The royalists, on the other hand, believe that the Chancellor is afraid of the expansion of their popular power and is therefore doing everything possible to oppose their proposals for social reform. They feel that Schuschnigg's speech shows that he is not opposed to the restoration of the imperial family, but that the restoration must be promoted by himself. Since the royalists have already made considerable progress in the future of the restoration, they do not want to be pushed aside. Furthermore, Schuschnigg's statement that the future of the political system will be decided by the Austrian people is not intended to be decided by a public vote, but only by a collective discussion of all Austrian county chiefs. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 14th)

[Berlin] - Although German officials have maintained silence after Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg's speech in Vienna yesterday, political figures feel disappointed and especially unhappy because Schuschnigg decided to strictly suppress various Germanic nationalist cultural groups within Austria.

### A Certain Country Directs the Dismantling of a Fake Communist Party Organization

Heaven-sent Military Police Maintain Strict Vigilance for Days; Fake Communist Party Plots to Cause Disturbances During the Spring Festival; Detectives Arrest Five Major Criminals Based on Reports

Tianjin Communication: During the Spring Festival period, the vigilance here is extremely strict. Police teams are densely deployed in Xingye, Huaan, and major streets in the Southern City, as well as at the intersections of the Japanese and Chinese Concessions. Armored vehicles patrol back and forth incessantly. This state of alert has not yet been lifted. After 7:00 PM every evening, armed security teams are dispatched. According to the authorities, the restrictions will not be relaxed until after the Lantern Festival. Although this vigilance is a general practice during the Spring Festival, its severity is far from ordinary. Before the Spring Festival, the Detective Team of the Tianjin Municipal Police Bureau uncovered two locations of the Fake Communist Party organization, one in Liujia Lane on Fushu Street and one in Qiaodong Jinji Street in the city. It was learned that a certain party had instigated Fang Yongchang, Qiu Wenkai, Li Yingjie, and others, former frustrated military personnel of the Zhili-Lu Clique, to recruit former subordinates for secret activities, creating fake red terror, in order to provide an excuse for a certain party to force the special status of North China. At that time, because Fang Yongchang recruited many fake members, who were scattered and hidden in the city, there was a fear that the search and arrest would not be exhaustive and the prevention would not be thorough. These people inevitably thought cunningly. Therefore, on the one hand, detectives were secretly instructed to pay attention to the investigation, and on the other hand, it was known that the fake members wanted to riot during the Spring Festival, so strict arrangements were made. When the Lunar New Year arrived, the Detective Team received a definite report that Li Shixin (28 years old), Zhang Binshan (30 years old), Li Huating (40 years old), Lin Langxiao (29 years old), Xiao Deping (32 years old), and other five people were leading rioters. They planned to take advantage of the night of the Lunar New Year, when there were lights and firecrackers in every household, to drive out in cars from Dajing Road, Kunwei Road, and Erma Road in Hebei District, throwing bombs and firing guns in separate groups. Then, they would go through Bei Da Guan and the Southern City, distributing red terror leaflets and shouting slogans along the way, so that the city would fall into great chaos and the people would be extremely panic. After the incident, they would escape from the Southern City into a certain concession. After obtaining the accurate report, Detective Team Captain Qiao Weiming ordered the Third Team Captain to select capable detectives to rush to No. 7 Xiaotufang, Shuangjiekou, Liangjiazui, the gathering place of the fake members, before dawn on the Lunar New Year. Unexpectedly, Li Shixin and other five people were captured. On the spot, a large number of absurd documents, such as printed fake communist leaflets and slogans, and four large bombs were found. After taking the five criminals back to the team for interrogation, they all confessed truthfully. In recent days, detectives have been working to search for their accomplices based on their confessions. It is reported that the number of people who have joined this fake communist party is about 500, scattered in Ping, Jin, Bao, and the four railway lines of the Beining, PingSui, PingHan, and JinPu, all waiting for an opportunity to act. Therefore, each railway line has received a secret consultation from the local authorities and has been implementing precautions in recent days. Fang Yongchang himself has gone to Baoding and Shijiazhuang to engage in secret activities. All command affairs in Tianjin are hosted by Mr. Da Gongyuan (pseudonym), a certain national, and Qiu Wenkai. Although the aforementioned fake members have been captured by our authorities, their desire to disrupt the local area has not diminished. On the 13th, they gathered in a certain fresh fruit shop on a certain street in a certain concession to secretly discuss that they still wanted to take action in the near future. Therefore, the city authorities have continuously increased the number of regular troops transferred from the suburbs to the city for joint defense since the 14th to prevent accidents. (14th)

### Japanese Expansion of Power in Fujian

Increased Budget for the Xiamen Consulate General, Large-Scale Dumping of Northeastern Products, Training of Commercial and Intelligence Personnel, Significant Increase in Taiwanese Migration to Fujian Last Year

Xiamen Correspondence: Following Japan's aggressive southward expansion policy last year, the "Taiwan Colonization Company" and the "Nanyang Colonization Company" were first established. Subsequently, the system of the Governor-General of Taiwan was reformed, with a military officer serving as the Governor-General directly under the Emperor, holding a position equivalent to the Governor-General of Korea. Admiral Koshirō Kobayashi was appointed as the first military Governor-General. The targets of this southward expansion are South China and Southeast Asia. The measures implemented in South China include: ㊀ Last autumn, the Japanese Consulate in Xiamen was upgraded to a Consulate General. The budget for the Japanese Consulate General in Xiamen this year has also been increased from 200,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan annually (some say 260,000 yuan). It is rumored that the Japanese government will soon dispatch 60 rigorously trained armed police officers to supplement the Japanese Consulates in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou, with approximately 20 stationed in Xiamen. This deployment is expected to be realized from mid-April to June. ㊁ In the economic sphere, last month, Yang Song, a Taiwanese senior official from the Production Bureau of the puppet "Manchukuo," arrived in Xiamen. Residing at the residence of Chen Xuehai, a comprador of the Osaka Company, he investigated commodity prices with various merchants in Xiamen. According to Yang, since the establishment of "Manchukuo," sales of soybean cakes, soybeans, and flour from Northeastern China have been sluggish in various parts of South China. He came specifically to investigate the reasons for this. If the prices are not competitive, he will find ways to make the goods arriving in Xiamen cheaper than the current market prices. However, he kept the specific methods secret. Yang also went to Shantou and Guangzhou. In early February, he went to Taiwan. It is said that soybean cakes will have a huge market in South China, as the rural areas of South China are still underdeveloped and require large amounts of fertilizer. After Yang's return, Northeastern products will be promoted on a large scale in South China. ㊂ Yang advocated in Xiamen that Taiwanese residing in Xiamen should form the "Xingzhong Company" as an organization to develop commerce in Southern Fujian and promote Japanese goods and Northeastern products. Therefore, after Yang left Xiamen, Chen Changfu, the chairman of the Taiwanese Residents Association in Xiamen, and Ye Zhensheng, a new Taiwanese resident, were responsible for preparing and organizing the Xingzhong Company with a capital of 200,000 yuan. Currently, there is also a proposal to reorganize the "Xiamen Financial Cooperative" into the "South China Trading Company." The Financial Cooperative was established last year and was originally a commercial and financial organization for Taiwanese in Xiamen planned by the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan. Due to insufficient fundraising and poor performance, it has been operating at a loss despite the annual subsidy of 1,500 yuan from the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan. Chen Changfu, the director of the cooperative, went to Taiwan last winter to request assistance from the Governor-General's Office. Coincidentally, there was a proposal to organize the "Xingzhong Company," so Chen planned to reorganize the Financial Cooperative into the "South China Trading Company," engaging in both commercial finance and import-export trade. He is currently still in Taiwan for negotiations. ㊃ In the southward expansion plan of the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, there is a proposal to establish a Japanese five-year Grade A Commercial School in Xiamen to cultivate commercial talent for developing markets in South China and Southeast Asia. The unused school site of the Japanese Asahi Ei School on Gulangyu has been selected for purchase and will be renovated with 500,000 Japanese yen. Students will be selected from commercial schools in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, and Taiwan to study in Gulangyu. Enrollment will be limited to Japanese and Korean students, excluding foreign and Taiwanese students. In addition to advanced commerce, the curriculum will also focus on intelligence training. After graduation, students will be sent to South China and Southeast Asia. The government will provide funds for them to engage in business and undertake special tasks assigned by the Japanese government. ㊄ In terms of immigration, the number of Taiwanese migrating to Xiamen has been increasing year by year. In the 31st year of the Meiji era, there were only 55 Taiwanese residents in Xiamen. After the founding of the Republic of China, according to official household registration surveys, there were 2,800 people in the 6th year of the Republic, 5,000 people in the 10th year, 6,800 people in the 18th year, 9,555 people in the 24th year, and 11,311 people in the 25th year. In the past year alone, there has been a sudden increase of more than 1,700 people. As for those who have not registered and have moved to the inland areas of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, there are approximately 7,000 to 8,000 people, totaling about 20,000 people.

In addition, there are two other matters that are also worth noting: ㊀ Starting from February 1st this year, the number of Taiwanese opium dens in Xiamen will be reduced from 300 to 250. Thereafter, 50 dens will be reduced every six months, with the aim of completely closing all opium dens in three years. However, in early February, a Taiwanese tycoon petitioned the Japanese Consul General in the name of providing relief to unemployed Taiwanese from opium dens, requesting the establishment of five amusement arcades in Xiamen, which are actually disguised gambling dens. It is rumored that the Japanese Consul General has already approved this request, but he is afraid of public opinion, as gambling has been prohibited in Xiamen for two years. Therefore, he stipulated that gambling must not be carried out secretly. The Taiwanese tycoon believes that the purpose of establishing amusement arcades is for gambling; otherwise, they are useless and is currently actively lobbying. ㊁ Smuggling in Southern Fujian by a certain country's nationals, which had subsided for a time during the summer and autumn of last year, has become rampant again by the end of the year. On February 7th, the Xiamen Customs anti-smuggling vessel "Flying Star" encountered a large fleet of seven smuggling sailing boats on the Meizhou Ocean off the coast. It immediately pursued and seized five of them, bringing them back for disposal. However, one sank midway due to a storm. On the 8th, it arrived in Xiamen, carrying over 700 bags of white sugar, over 3,000 boxes of kerosene, and items such as matches and flour, worth over 30,000 yuan. After investigation, it was learned that this large fleet of smuggling boats had departed from Taiwan and was heading towards Sanduao. However, it is rare for the Xiamen Customs to encounter smugglers gathering seven sailing boats, with the value of goods seized from the four boats reaching over 30,000 yuan. (February 14th)

### Songjiang

Status of Business Closures

After the major business closure here, only the Yi Da silk and satin giant, and Guangfeng Southern Goods store, ceased trading. Other businesses have all benefitted. In particular the rice, sesame oil cake, and bran industries, have benefitted the most. The Xin Yu Money Exchange in the financial sector profited by over 20,000, and Yu Kang, Shen Yuan, Cheng Da also made around 10,000. The Yellow Industry Bank's profits were similar. The timber, silk cloth, southern goods, gold, and clothing trades, all also made a profit. However, the consumer industry performed comparatively worse.

### Suzhou

Banks and Money Exchanges Closing in Succession

Business at the banks and money exchanges of Suzhou has been good this past year, with most securing a profit. However, the Suzhou branch of the Shanghai Zhonghe Bank has closed after the main office indicated that they did not intend to manage the Suzhou branch. All depositors were notified on the 15th that all deposits will be handled by the Shanghai main office. Furthermore, in addition to the Yong Sheng Money Exchange of Xizhong City having declared it would close on the 13th, the Yi Kang of Guanqian Street and the Jin Sheng of Dongzhong City, both money exchanges, also closed yesterday. Loans released by these two exchanges both exceed 1 million, and they will be successively recouping loans to repay depositors. Yesterday (the 15th) only eight of the money exchanges listed.

Full Opening of the SuFu Road

The entire SuFu highway project (Suzhou to Guangfu) has long been completed. The long distance bus service is managed by the commercially operated SuFu long distance bus company. A bus service between Suzhou and Shanren Bridge is already in operation and business is flourishing. The company, foreseeing that the plum blossoms of Guangfu Township and Dengwei Mountain's Fragrant Snow Sea will soon bloom, to provide convenience for tourists coming from further afield, has decided to fully open the route from March 1st. From then on tourists from further afield can travel to Dengwei for plum blossom viewing and return in a single day, making travel very convenient. Preparations are underway for the opening of the route.

### Wuxi

Re-investigation of Opium Addicts Concludes

The county-wide re-investigation of opium addicts in Wuxi concluded at the end of last month. Then, the provincial government, in order to purify the atmosphere of opium, specially extended the deadline by ten days. Within those final ten days, the county government urged police officers, as well as the heads of Baojia in each district, township, and village, to capture a very large number of private opium smokers. According to statistics from the county government, a total of 1,451 private opium smokers were captured during the forty day re-investigation. Those who tested and were found to have no addiction were released on bail. Those who were found to have an addiction were ordered to quit their addiction. After that they were handed over to the district security headquarters. The county government telegraphed the provincial government and the provincial office about the details of the general re-investigation. In the future, any opium addicts captured will be handed over to the district headquarters to be punished according to the law.

Correspondence

### The Truth About the So-Called Chinese People's Front and a Review of its Theories (Continued)

— Luo Mei Huan

Firstly: It is a Communist Front, Not a United Front

A nation should possess a solid and unified foundation, especially during times of national crisis or even when launching a war of resistance. There is an even greater need for an indivisible, iron-like unity, advancing in unison with one heart and one mind under central leadership, to achieve the great mission of national liberation. In recent years, through the efforts of the Kuomintang, the foundation for national unity has been built. The achievements in this area were fully demonstrated during the Xi'an Incident. However, this work is the great path to national salvation for the Chinese nation, but it is also the greatest threat to the Chinese Communist Party, because they fear nothing more than chaos, which they can exploit for their own benefit. A unified nation leaves them with no weaknesses to exploit, leading to their inevitable defeat. Therefore, they use their seemingly plausible theories to forcibly divide the holistic nation-state into various stages and factions, to provoke emotions between ethnic groups and eliminate the power of unity. Then, they take a further step and propose a united front, while hiding behind the scenes and mobilizing their disciples and followers to act as their mouthpieces, so that the people will forget their hideous faces of murderers and arsonists. Their methods are clever, but the trick is easily exposed.

The word "united" may sound good, but it is actually an impossible and irrational fantasy. Resistance war is not the same as an ordinary gathering, because the rapidly changing nature of warfare requires a supreme leader who can make decisive decisions on the spot, and because war involves many aspects, it requires a unified national belief. The People's Front advocates that various parties and factions should have consistent awareness in resisting the enemy, but maintain their old views on politics, economics, and even the nation-state. This is truly a brazen deception that is far removed from the reality of national salvation. Moreover, their so-called unity is not sincere at all. Let us look at the confession of the united front theorist, Mr. Liu Bian:

"A united front does not mean taking the best from each and eliminating all internal contradictions, but rather uniting on one hand and struggling on the other..." (To be continued)

### Overview of Japanese Controlled Slave Education in Jilin

Changchun Establishes Primary School Maintenance Association, Education in Yongji Also Monitored by Japanese

[Northeast News Agency] The Japanese have been actively promoting slave education in the Northeast for several years, sparing no effort. Now, with the start of the spring semester, this is an excellent opportunity to implement their anesthetizing policies. The following is a detailed account of the slave education in Changchun and Yongji counties, the most prominent in Jilin Province:

Education in Changchun

(Changchun Correspondence) The puppet Changchun County authorities, starting this year, are implementing a plan to promote slave education under the orders of the Japanese. The Changchun County Primary School Maintenance Association has been established. On the surface, it is sponsored and promoted by the puppet county government. Currently, the education situation in Changchun County includes 80 county-run primary schools with approximately 9,000 students, and 200 private schools with approximately 4,000 students. In order to promote Japanese culture, the Japanese are planning to add more county-run primary schools. The curriculum of private schools should also include more Japanese language courses, and they must be converted into county-run schools in the future. Furthermore, the Japanese side has decided to add 80 schools this year and implement a five-year county education plan to establish 400 schools within five years. However, this plan is closely related to the budget, and its implementation will inevitably face considerable difficulties. The puppet school maintenance association, leveraging the power of the Japanese, plans to levy contributions from each household based on their wealth to use as maintenance and administrative fees for local schools in the future.

Education in Yongji

(Yongji Correspondence) The puppet Yongji County's education budget is divided into county funds and district funds. The budgeted county funds for this year are 51,051 yuan, and the budgeted district funds are 81,616 yuan, totaling 132,667 yuan. However, the income from district school properties has always been managed by each school themselves. In the spring of the previous year, the puppet county government, under the pretext of rectifying school funds, proposed rectification measures to submit the income from each school's farmland to the puppet county government for mixed custody and distribution. Since the implementation of this measure, much of it has been embezzled.

Number of Schools and Classes

There are a total of 100 schools in Yongji County, including 37 county schools and 65 district schools, with a total of 167 higher and lower level classes. There are 9,568 children enrolled, including 2,045 girls. Currently, there are 49 schools that have been closed. The reasons for their closure are mostly due to non-compliance with the Japanese anesthetizing education policy. The puppet county government, due to limited financial resources, only restored 14 schools with 15 classes this spring. There are still 35 schools that have been closed and not restored. It is planned to gradually restore them within two years and set up Japanese language intensive classes or increase Japanese language courses. However, due to financial constraints, the equipment in the schools that have opened is simple. However, they must be serious and meticulous in the Japanese language courses.

Situation of Private Schools

There are currently 328 private schools in Yongji County, mostly located in villages and settlements without schools or with too many students. The teachers have all been examined and approved by the Japanese and puppets, and assigned separately. In addition to Japanese scriptures, the teaching subjects also include fixed Chinese language, moral character, arithmetic, nature, and filial piety courses. From time to time, the Japanese and the puppet county government send personnel to observe whether there are anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese ideas in the teaching. According to statistics, there are a total of 8,000 students in the schools. Most of the teachers are pro-Japanese and are trusted by the Japanese.

Social Education

The so-called social education of the Japanese puppets has not been able to be promoted due to financial constraints. Only one public education center has been established. In addition to frequent lectures on Japanese-puppet friendship, it also handles literacy, reading books and newspapers, etc., as a gesture to gain fame and ingratiate themselves with the masses. As for public schools, only one or two were added in one or two school districts last year, totaling two classes. In addition, schools are used as the center for implementing social education and promoting their anesthetizing policies.

Future Plans

According to the Japanese puppet survey last autumn, there are a total of 70,649 school-age children in Yongji County. Among them, only 17,632 have been enrolled, with an enrollment rate of approximately 25%. There are still 53,017 who have not been enrolled. Taking this opportunity, the Japanese plan to restore the previously closed schools separately within the next two years and fully implement the Japanese education law. In addition, they plan not to add any more schools with county funds, but to provide detailed guidance and lectures to the private schools that have already been approved, so that they gradually move towards the purpose of Japanese-puppet harmony and friendship. When the time is right, they will select the best and convert them into public schools to promote the villages of slave education and Japanese-style social education. They plan to have the teachers and staff of each school be responsible for handling it in the future.

### Moving School Without Prior Approval Subject to Punishment

City Social Bureau Issued Order to Comply

The City Social Bureau previously stated that private schools in the city were moving school sites without prior notification, making it impossible to ascertain the situation. On December 19th of last year, an order was issued to all schools to submit a report to the bureau in advance for verification and approval before moving. This has been reported previously. Recently, as some have failed to comply, the previous order has been reiterated. Yesterday, an order was issued to all private primary and secondary schools in the city stating that moving school sites must be reported to the bureau in advance for approval. Failure to do so may result in revocation of registration or suspension of any subsidies. This was instructed to be followed in Order Hai Zi No. 8551 on December 29th, 25th year. Now, it is found that some schools are still failing to comply, which is unacceptable. It is hereby reiterated that in the future, all schools must report to the bureau for verification before moving school sites and must not report after moving. All must strictly comply with this order.

### Hebei Fishery School to be Placed Under Tianjin City Government Jurisdiction

(Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th) The Hebei Provincial Fishery School of Tianjin will be placed under the direct jurisdiction of the city government. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council has approved this. The Hebei Education Department and the city government are currently in consultation. Furthermore, all colleges and universities in Tianjin will also be placed under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin City Government.

### Standards for Handling Qualifications of University Graduates

Ministry of Education Revised Order

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th) The Ministry of Education has revised items 2 and 6 of the current standards for recognizing the qualifications of graduates from private colleges and universities that have been registered, and issued an order to all colleges and universities on the 15th for information.

### Wang Yuzhang Appointed Principal of Northeast Zhongshan School

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th) Li Xien, Director of the Northeast Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education, who concurrently served as the Principal of the National Northeast Zhongshan Middle School, has, with the approval of the Ministry of Education due to his inability to attend to both, appointed Wang Yuzhang as the Principal of the school.

### The Process of Determining the Prices of Newly Compiled Textbooks by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau (Continued)

A. Textbooks Compiled by the Compilation and Translation Bureau

Upper primary school Chinese language, first volume, 72 pages, plus 2 pages for the cover, priced at one dime. Lower primary school Chinese language, first volume, 31 pages, with four pages of color illustrations, plus 2 pages for the cover, priced at six cents.

B. Textbooks Compiled by Various Bookstores

㊀ Kaiming: Upper primary school Chinese language, first volume, 45 pages, plus one page for the cover, nine cents. Lower primary school Chinese language, first volume, 27 pages, with one and a half pages of color illustrations, six cents.

㊁ Zhonghua: Lower primary school Chinese language, first volume, 27 pages, with color illustrations, six cents.

㊂ World: Upper primary school Chinese language, first volume, 61 pages, plus one page for the cover, twelve cents. Lower primary school Chinese language, first volume, 27 pages, with two pages of color illustrations, six cents.

㊃ Commercial Press: Lower primary school Chinese language, first volume, 26 pages, with two pages of color illustrations, six cents.

From the above, it can be seen that the prices of the Compilation and Translation Bureau's textbooks are actually lower than those of the textbooks compiled by bookstores. Although the number of pages in the later volumes of the textbooks compiled by the Compilation and Translation Bureau has increased more significantly, the price was still not allowed to be increased according to the decision at the time. In the past two months, we have repeatedly informed the larger bookstores and urged them to continue to reduce prices. However, due to the drastic changes in the source of paper recently and the sudden surge in paper prices, the goal of continued price reduction has not yet been achieved. However, the Ministry still insists that even if paper prices rise, the prices of primary school and public textbooks must not be increased. The above situation may not be fully known to the outside world, so we do not hesitate to provide detailed information to clarify the truth.

### Scout Wartime Service Corps Holds Graduation Ceremony Yesterday

Chen Zuoyou and 40 Others Graduate, Tong Hangbai and Others Attend and Deliver Speeches

### American Elementary School Students Wish to Correspond with Our Elementary School Students

A Letter Addressed to Minister Wang of Our Ministry of Education, to be Forwarded to All Elementary School Students Nationwide

The Ministry of Education recently issued an order to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities stating that the Ministry had received a letter from all students of the eighth grade of the Otterland Elementary School in Ottawa, USA, stating that they are extremely willing to communicate and correspond with children in our country. Please forward this letter to all elementary school students, etc. The original letter from the students of the school is hereby copied and sent to the said education bureaus for forwarding to all elementary schools under their jurisdiction for information. The original letter is attached below: To Minister of the Ministry of Education of Nanjing, China, We, the entire eighth grade class, are extremely willing to communicate and correspond with friends in your country. We will highly value it. If you would send this letter to the teachers to be forwarded to the students to communicate and correspond with us, we would be especially grateful. We hereby present this letter and express our gratitude in advance, and wish you good health. After receiving the order from the Ministry, the City Social Bureau has ordered all public and registered private elementary schools in the city to forward the information to their students.

### International Problems Research Association Welcomes Rao at Tea Party

The International Problems Research Association held a tea party at the Bank Association yesterday afternoon at 5:00 pm to welcome the famous Indian scholar Mr. Rao (P. Kodanda Rao, a key member of the Servants of India Society working with Gandhi). Mr. Rao is on a world tour and arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month. He took a night train to Beijing last night.

Guests Attending: Those who attended the tea party last night included Mr. Rao, Li Zhaohuan, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaoji, Zhu Shaoping, He Dekui, Cheng Haifeng, Dai Baoqian, Tu Chuyu, and others, totaling over 30 people. Mr. Li gave a speech to introduce Mr. Rao, stating that Mr. Rao is a famous Indian scholar who is on a world tour. Passing through Shanghai, the Association specially invited him to give a lecture on the current situation in India and the new constitution. Mr. Rao's Lecture: Mr. Rao then gave a lecture, stating that India is a British possession. In 1917, a representative government was implemented, and a constitution was planned. However, everything is based on the will of the British. The new constitution assigns education, industry, and other undertakings to agencies organized by elected representatives in various provinces, while legislation and administration are still managed by the British, which is not enough to express the will of the Indian people.

### Shanghai Interport Team Loses to Military Combined Team

Result: 1-2. Shanghai's Ma Shan'er Absent. Shanghai Chinese Team to Play Hong Kong Combined Team Tomorrow.

Hong Kong, 15th. The Shanghai Interport Team, which had been winning consistently, played an exhibition match against the Hong Kong Military Combined Team at the So Kon Po ground at half past three this afternoon. Because Shanghai's star player Ma Shan'er had returned north, Ke Laituo played right back, Wei Ketai left back, and forward Wei Lihuate played right inside forward, with the rest of the lineup as before. As a result, their strength was greatly reduced. In the first half, they were able to mount an attack, with Roberts Stoff scoring a goal. The Military Combined Team tried hard to counterattack and took advantage of two fouls by Shanghai players, but the penalty kicks were unsuccessful. Less than a minute into the second half, the Military Combined Team's Hua Qiao Chen scored with a kick, tying the score. Fifteen minutes later, the Military Combined Team's Mila and Shi Ba rushed forward as the ball landed near the opposing goal, and they rolled into the goal with the ball. After that, both sides attacked and defended, but there were no further scores. Shanghai ultimately lost 1-2 and failed to maintain their winning streak. After the match, the Hong Kong Football Association held a banquet at the Hong Kong Hotel, and the event ended late at night with everyone enjoying themselves. The team is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the British mail ship Nartra on the morning of the 18th. The East China Team is scheduled to play its final exhibition match against the Hong Kong Combined Team at Caroline Hill on the afternoon of the 17th, and then travel to Guangdong province on the 18th to raise funds for the hospital through a charity match before returning to Shanghai.

### First Battle of the Sino-British Billiards Match: Shen Lince Narrowly Wins Against Gain

Result: 600-514. Today: Wu Chengqi vs. Qu Shim.

The veteran Shen Lince, who came to Shanghai from the capital to participate in the Sino-British billiards match, narrowly defeated Gain yesterday with a score of 600-514. Starting at 5:30 PM today, Wu Chengqi from the fourth group of the Chinese team will play against Qu Shim from the British team in a 600-point match at the billiards room of the Shanghai Amateur Billiards Association at 88 Nanjing Road.

Shen Lince has been away from Shanghai for a long time. He has been passionate about billiards for over twenty years. Although his golden age has passed, his experienced tactics and versatile skills still make him a top player in today's billiards world. Looking at his overall performance yesterday, his start and finish were very impressive, but it's a pity that he wasn't very energetic in the middle, otherwise he wouldn't have won by only 86 points.

In the second shot of the opening, Shen scored 24 points, taking the lead all the way and creating a difference of 124-55, a distance of 69 points. At that time, Gain took the opportunity to catch up, scoring only a few points each time, but gradually accumulated to a tie of 285. After that, Shen suddenly rallied, scoring huge numbers such as 31, 34, 40, 38, and 0, taking the lead again with 540-443. At the end, when Shen was at 557-488, his opponent's ball had already fallen into the pocket, and only one red ball was left on the table. Shen successively hit the middle pocket and made his own ball fall in, displaying accurate and methodical play worthy of praise. Lacking stamina at the end, he shook his head and failed to score at the 29th shot and was overtaken by Gain by 26 points, resulting in a final score of 600-514.

### A Respectful Message to the Chinese Nursing Community (Part 1)

— Li Lingdong

With the unfolding of medical construction in China and the establishment of the goal of reforming medical education, the promotion of the nursing profession and the advancement of nursing education have also been set in motion. Doctors cannot do without nurses, and nurses cannot do without doctors. "Medicine" and "nursing" have a closer relationship of interdependence in their professions and work, and are equally important. This is something that every doctor and every nurse agrees on and silently acknowledges in their hearts. However, the actual encounters and the reality are quite different. In the depths of many nurses' hearts, there is nothing but complaints, sighs, discouragement, and loss of confidence in their own profession. They cannot recognize the importance of the profession they are engaged in. If this continues, when will the entire nursing career see a day of dawn and a day of development? Therefore, at the time of the budding of the Chinese nursing cause, standing under the bitter wind and drizzling rain, hesitating and wandering, I humbly offer a few sincere words to the entire Chinese community, hoping that the senior nurses in the country will teach me and correct my shortcomings.

(1) A Respectful Greeting to All Male Nurse Comrades.

In the minds and consciousness of every male nurse, there is a kind of improper, distorted, and deformed development. They do not take working hard in their own profession as a prerequisite, but are filled with a mentality of hanging out a sheep's head but selling dog meat, wanting to go down the road of becoming a doctor. They want to leave their own profession and constantly fantasize about the idea of becoming a doctor, trying every means to get a doctor's certificate in order to satisfy their desires.

I, who find the mentality of male nurses becoming doctors to be abnormal, completely oppose this view and extremely disagree with this idea. My reasons are as follows:

(1) In terms of academics: There is a simple and obvious fact that will tell us that even doctors who have just graduated from medical university or who have graduated not long ago have received considerable education in medical and pharmaceutical knowledge and practical clinical training. However, whether they can reach the ideal doctor is still a question. Being a doctor is not an easy task. It is not just a matter of prescribing a prescription for a headache to stop the headache. Even if you can do that, the ability to be a doctor requires in-depth research and understanding of various sciences, and the application of that knowledge to diagnose diseases in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and treatment. The difficulty of training a doctor's profession lies in this. In this regard, you can know whether nurses becoming doctors is appropriate or not. Please think about it calmly!

(2) In terms of society: Chinese society is becoming brighter day by day, and politics is getting on track day by day. The National Assembly is about to be held, and the Constitution is about to be implemented. It can already be seen that the dawn of a small country in the future is approaching. Under the sound national laws, no profession will be allowed to be chaotic, disorganized, or upside down. Doctors and nurses each have their own professional scope, regulations, and laws. Therefore, we can know what kind of consciousness the government has when it holds nurse certificate registrations and controls health personnel. We spent a lot of effort and wasted some precious time, but the results were fruitless, and we could not get through this road. Therefore, nurses should recognize reality, grasp the present, and quickly eliminate the illusion of wanting to become doctors.

Since we know that male nurses replacing doctors is a dead end, let's put all our energy and focus on nursing itself, so that nursing education can be developed and the nursing profession can be elevated. The current task of the nursing community is to strive for improving the salary standards of nurses. This is our only survival issue. If nurses' salaries are not much different from doctors' salaries, then the psychology of undervaluing the nursing profession and the reason for not being able to solve life's problems will naturally be easily solved. Therefore, male nurse comrades, recognize this struggle, return to the nursing community, and quickly escape from that gray circle of self-destruction. Stop dreaming about becoming doctors!

(2) Suggestions to the Educational Administrative Authorities of Nurses

Since the Chinese Nursing Association, with foreigners as its background, announced its separation, the Special Committee on Nursing Education has been established in the Ministry of Education to build the Chinese nursing cause with its own administrative power. The Chinese nursing cause has the possibility of embarking on a complete path. We should be grateful. The mission and responsibility undertaken by the Nursing Education Committee is so important. Externally, it concerns the face of the country; internally, it concerns the prosperity of the entire nursing community. Therefore, the performance of the Nursing Education Committee is something that we cannot but care about. How to actively reform nursing education and how to improve nursing administration will not be discussed for the time being. The following questions are worth the attention and research of the officials of the Nursing Education Committee:

(1) Publishing Publications: The Nursing Education Committee is the highest authority in the national nursing community. Every nursing school and nurse has no way of knowing the status of nursing knowledge, nursing education policies, nursing regulations, and all nursing information. Therefore, it must rely on the power of publications or gazettes to transmit and communicate the barriers between the two parties. Although the "Medical Education" publication issued by the Ministry of Education has a very wide range, including medicine, pharmacy, nursing, and midwifery, and because of space limitations, it cannot publish as much text as possible on nursing. At the same time, the Chinese Nursing Association, a private academic organization, also publishes a "Chinese Nursing Quarterly." Therefore, an independent publication of our highest nursing administrative authority is essential and is an urgent need.

(2) Establishing More Standard Schools: To promote Chinese nursing education, we must implement ideal nursing education and create modern nursing talents. The establishment of nursing schools under a standard system is essential as the location for practical work, and is necessary to promote nursing education to perfection. However, China is vast and expansive. Although there is a Central Advanced Nursing Vocational School established in Nanjing to create rational nursing talents, this can only benefit a few provinces and cannot make the reform of nursing education popular and promoted throughout the country. Therefore, each province must be ordered to establish a standard nursing school to create nursing talents in its own province, so that even remote provinces can enjoy the service of the nursing profession. Nursing education can be laid on a cornerstone in Chinese society, and day by day, the future of Chinese nursing education can be promoted infinitely.

### What We Should Know About Influenza

— Zhong Zhihe

We have been reading in the newspapers for days that influenza is extremely prevalent in Britain, and there have been many deaths. According to the survey, the number of people who died from the disease in the previous week reached 1,137, and this week it has increased to 1,155. The speed of its spread and the number of its deaths are enough to be alarming. This disease is a major epidemic, belonging to a type of acute infectious disease. It is a local epidemic or sporadic disease. In the previous century, there were four major epidemics, in 1853, 1866, 1890, and 1899 to 1890, and then from 1917 to 1918. This was the third major epidemic in recent years. The momentum was very strong. It spread globally, and there were many deaths in various countries. In 1921, it was prevalent in the Far East. It spread to the world, but the epidemic was not severe. According to the disease's epidemic, each place generally lasts for six to eight weeks, and few are spared by the epidemic tide. During a major epidemic, it accounts for almost 40% of the entire population, or stronger. The severity of its infectiousness is truly terrifying. Now that it has become prevalent in Britain, and once it is transmitted to our country due to the convenience of transportation, even if the mortality rate is not very high, it is a minor harm after being infected and weakening the body, affecting lifelong health. How can we ignore it and not take precautions, and not have a deep understanding of the disease? The disease is described below for reference -

▲ Causes

Predisposing factors - (1) The mucous membrane of the respiratory system has mucosal disease or the body's resistance is weak and it is easy to suffer from a cold (2) Alcoholics (3) Adults are more likely to suffer from the disease and women are more likely than men, but the mortality rate is lower (4) Epidemic season According to Hirsch's survey of 175 epidemics, most of them occurred in spring. If they occur in winter, the disease is more severe and the mortality rate is higher.

Inciting factors - (1) Contact infection such as coughing, sneezing, saliva, and phlegm are sufficient to transmit the disease (2) Caused by the influenza bacillus discovered by Pfeiffer of Germany in 1892. Recently, an American doctor discovered a bacillus called Bacterium Pneumo-Sintes, which may also be the pathogen of the disease (3) Carriers

▲ Symptoms

(1) Incubation period: one to four days. The onset of the disease is sudden and the symptoms vary according to the type of disease.

(2) Respiratory system type - The respiratory tract from the nose to the lungs can be affected. Those with mild cases have catarrhal symptoms, but the body feels extremely fatigued. Those with severe cases often have tracheobronchitis, pleurisy, pneumonia, etc., and often leave behind the sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis. According to Newsholme's experience, the third major epidemic from 1917 to 1918 resulted in a large increase in pulmonary tuberculosis patients and is the most dangerous complication of tuberculosis. However, according to a survey by Fischberg during the epidemic in the United States from 1918 to 1919, there was no tendency to develop tuberculosis after the disease was cured. If there was any, it was a pre-existing injury.

(3) Gastrointestinal type - Present diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, bad breath, coated tongue, anorexia, headache, acid regurgitation, abdominal pain, or even diarrhea and presenting mental exhaustion. Pregnant women are prone to miscarriage.

(4) Nervous system type - Headache, dizziness, neuralgia, insomnia, mental excitement, or consequently developing neuritis, encephalitis, meningitis, epilepsy, mental illness, etc.

▲ Treatment

Prevention - (1) Strictly isolate the patient (2) Strictly disinfect and sterilize the patient's nasal secretions, saliva, or phlegm (3) Do not visit the patient (4) Wear masks (5) During an epidemic, do not enter movie theaters, theaters, and various recreational public places (6) Do not take crowded streetcars, buses, trains, or ships (7) Try to use vaccine injection for prevention (8) Be careful of cold and heat to prevent catching a cold (9) The harbor quarantine office should carry out inspections on incoming ships in accordance with the law (10) Prohibit kissing (11) Do not use public towels, bowls, chopsticks, or teacups (12) Wash hands and gargle before meals (13) Children should especially be prohibited from putting their fingers in their mouths (14) Strictly prohibit spitting anywhere (15) The health bureau and the public works bureau should manage street cleaning and sprinkle more water to avoid dust flying (16) Advise not to moisten stamps or envelopes with saliva to avoid carrying germs

Treatment - (1) Bed rest until the fever subsides completely (2) Use mild laxatives to clear the bowels (3) Eat nutritious foods such as milk, eggs, glucose, grape juice, oranges, beef juice, chicken juice, bread, malt extract, etc. every two to three hours in rotation. Porridge and soup are also good (4) Drink more hot drinks (5) You can take a hot bath, but avoid getting cold (6) Bedding should be light and warm. For those with high fever, an ice pack can be used on the forehead (7) The air in the bedroom must be circulating and the sunlight must be shining (8) Pay attention to the weakness of the heart. If necessary, use a bedpan for urination and defecation (9) If there are symptoms of the respiratory system, nervous system, or gastrointestinal system, consult a doctor and do not take medicine indiscriminately. Recently, doctors have advocated using serum injection to achieve results. Others advocate taking the patient's own blood and performing intramuscular injection of 5 to 10 cc each time for three times, or it may be cured (10) Those who are mentally depressed and have difficulty recovering after the illness can transfer to a sanatorium (End)

### Developing Medicine to Make the Chinese People Understand New Medicine (Part 1)

— Xia Chengdao

Medicine is a science that maintains health and relieves disease. It is not a江湖 business of fist-fighting and selling plasters, nor is it an abstruse philosophy of discussing yin and yang and talking about the five elements. Everyone who enters [the world], regardless of who they are, is always a body of flesh and blood, not an indestructible Vajra. Regarding all aspects of life, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, slight violations of hygiene rules can easily lead to various ailments. Ailments are extremely painful. Whether old or young, male or female, rich or poor, everyone wants to find a way to recover their health as soon as possible, so there is medicine. Now, let's talk about Chinese medicine. The Chinese people often divide medicine into "Western medicine" and "Chinese medicine." These terms of "Chinese medicine" and "Western medicine" are completely wrong. However, these terms are what the Chinese people are used to calling them, especially those who are enthusiastically promoting what they see as the essence of the nation. Before explaining, for the convenience of the Chinese people to understand, I also cited these incorrect terms in the above text. Hereafter, they must be corrected.

What is called "Western medicine" is actually "scientific medicine." It is based on the most precise physics, chemistry, physiology, pathology, bacteriology, pharmacology, and other sciences, combined to form a pure science of medicine. Science is the study and explanation of all things in the natural world. Science is shared by the world. For example, if a German person researches and invents something in natural science, it will be distributed to the world. After verification by people from various countries, if it is recognized as correct, this knowledge becomes the common property of all countries in the world. Everyone can use it and enjoy it, and it cannot be exclusively occupied as private property by any country or individual. However, the inventor receives the praise and respect of the world, and their country also gains infinite glory. The more specialized talents a country has in inventing natural sciences, the higher the country's international status. The money and weapons used to enrich the country and strengthen the army are also products of science. French inventions are similarly available for global common use, and the same is true for the United States and Britain. There is no way that French natural science has its own French theory, and Britain and the United States have their own British and American theories. In other words, natural science cannot be divided by national boundaries; it is a common product of all countries in the world. In short, the Earth is a whole, and natural science is unified. Science is the collection of many sciences and is shared by the world. It can be called "world medicine." The medicine of neighboring Japan is also "scientific medicine." Therefore, it is a big mistake for the Chinese people to call "scientific medicine" "Western medicine." As for our Chinese people calling ourselves "Chinese medicine," it is like closing the door and talking beautifully, making foreigners laugh their heads off.

Natural science is conducted separately, progresses day by day, and is researched and developed through practical experiments by gathering the blood, sweat, and spirit of countless scientists around the world. If the predecessors made mistakes, the successors must refute them. It is definitely not like our Chinese adherence to the ancient, considering criticism of ancient sages as a great rebellion. Therefore, for thousands of years, we still promote the prevalence of the essence of the nation based on yin and yang. We have made no progress, which is truly shameful! Whenever there is a new invention in natural science that is beneficial for treatment, scientific medicine will introduce and use it. Therefore, scientific medicine also follows natural science and progresses day by day, undergoing constant change. Therefore, scientific medicine is called "new medicine," while the ancient, conservative essence of national medicine is called "old medicine." These new terms are more accurate, and some people in society are gradually getting used to them.

The Chinese people see that the medicines used in new medicine are imported, so they call them "Western medicine," while the medicines used in old medicine come from our own country, so they call them "Chinese medicine." This is certainly not correct. The medicines used in new medicine are taken from animals, plants, and minerals, but scientific methods are used to refine and extract the more effective components for treatment. However, our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, with even more animals, plants, and minerals. It is a pity that we have not been able to use science, so today we still use ancient methods from thousands of years ago. A large package of crude herbs, half a bowl of water, boiled down to seven-tenths, containing feces and urine, is consumed in one's stomach. Its ignorance and inferiority are deplorable!

Old medicine diagnoses diseases only by placing three fingers on the patient's pulse. The speed, slowness, tension, and height of the pulse are used to diagnose everything, and yin and yang and the five elements are used for far-fetched speculation and metaphysical talk. Therefore, for the same disease, old doctors rely on their three-inch tongue to make metaphysical elaborations and fabrications, to the point where each establishes his own theory, adheres to his own views, and has his own theory. The general public is superstitious, poisoned by the yin and yang qi transformation for thousands of years, and even thinks they understand and follow it. The diagnosis of diseases in new medicine is incomparably precise. To understand the speed and slowness of blood flow, and the tension and height of blood pressure, "pulse diagnosis" is used. To know the hardness and formation of internal and external lesions, and their location, "palpation" is used. To clearly understand whether the heart's mechanism is working normally, "auscultation" is used. To know the condition of the lungs, "percussion" and "auscultation" are used together. To know the patient's past symptoms and current subjective symptoms, there is "anamnesis." What can be seen on the outside is "inspection." What cannot be seen with the eyes inside the body is "X-ray diagnosis." And for microscopic pathogens that cannot be seen with the naked eye, "microscopic diagnosis" and "serological tests" are used. In summary, the diagnosis of a disease in new medicine can be said to be extremely detailed and precise, and each type of diagnosis has its own special equipment. It is by no means comparable to the old medicine that only knows how to use the clumsy method of three fingers and treats human life like a child's play.

However, the Chinese people, especially middle school students, university students, and important government officials who advocate the establishment of a Central National Medicine Hall, and some students who have studied abroad, still stubbornly say that "Chinese medicine has its unique features." And if you go to the countryside to talk about new medicine and old medicine, many people will proudly cite many facts, either saying "So-and-so had a certain disease that Western medicine could not cure, but was later cured by Chinese medicine," or saying "So-and-so had a disease that Western medicine diagnosed as incurable and would soon die, but was later cured by Chinese medicine," and also saying, "Someone in a certain village has a secret recipe that cures a certain disease with miraculous effects, or someone in a certain village has an ancestral crotch remedy that is very effective for curing a certain disease." This kind of talk is truly inexhaustible. These are facts, and we cannot blame the Chinese people for talking nonsense. However, the Chinese people should understand that the entry of Western medicine into our country was due to imperialists using unequal treaties, with hypocrisy and a false mask of compassion, carrying the Bible in the name of spreading religion, and secretly carrying out their ambitions of aggression. In order to cover up their fox tails, they established schools and hospitals in places where churches were located, managed by clergy. The Chinese people were short-sighted and easily deceived, thinking that the clergy were truly benevolent and compassionate. However, foreign clergy only understood a little medical knowledge and were not true medical doctors. Only in the larger treaty ports did hospitals established by foreigners have formal doctors in charge. At the same time, those who worked as nurses and servants in foreign hospitals, through hearing and seeing, also understood a little medical knowledge. After leaving the hospital, they called themselves doctors and hung up their shingles to practice medicine. It is no wonder that their knowledge was shallow, their learning was lacking, and their surgical skills were not refined. And among the formal foreign doctors who practiced medicine, there were also examples of those who had become infected with our bad habits, being cunning and deceitful. Of course, they did not gain the trust of the Chinese people, but this was a bankruptcy of their character. It is hoped that the Chinese people will not mistakenly record this in the account of formal doctors, so as to avoid confusing pearls with fish eyes.

Moreover, the human body is an ingenious, delicate, and very complex instrument. When a machine is damaged, it is necessary to ask a specialist doctor to repair it. Although science has developed to this point, it is sometimes not enough to repair the ingenious human body. Therefore, some diseases are not yet understood. However, what is known is known, and what is not known is not known. It is definitely not like the omnipotence of the three fingers of old medicine, and the absurd and unfounded nonsense of yin and yang qi transformation, which can be used to distort and perfunctorily explain everything. We hope that everyone will work hard to study, that science will advance day by day, and that medicine will also progress accordingly. The diseases that are not yet understood in part now will hopefully be understood in the future, in order to relieve the suffering of patients and seek the happiness of mankind. It is definitely not like the old medicine and some of the Chinese people, who regard the human body as something mysterious, and that immortality pills, magic medicines, and spells can be used to deceive and remove the evil spirits that cause disease.

Diseases are divided into acute and chronic. Chronic diseases require time to treat, and it may take years and months. If the patient does not have the patience or has financial difficulties and cannot be treated for a long time, and fails to achieve the desire for a cure, they will slanderously say "Western medicine is useless." This is too unfair!

### Our Country Decides to Participate in the World Textile Conference

National Federation of Commerce and Industry and others hold regular meetings to discuss candidates for labor and management representatives

The International Labour Office will hold a World Textile Conference in Washington, D.C., in April of this year, inviting our country to send representatives to attend. The government has already sent a letter to the National Federation of Commerce and Industry and other organizations to solicit opinions. It is reported that the Federation will convene leaders of the textile industry for consultation within a few days. The details are as follows:

Approved to be held in Washington, D.C.

The International Labour Office passed a resolution at its 20th session last year, requesting the Governing Body to convene a tripartite (government, labor, and management) meeting to discuss issues related to the textile industry. In November of the same year, at its 77th session, the Governing Body discussed the implementation of the resolution. The U.S. government representative proposed that the conference be invited in the name of the U.S. President to be held in Washington, D.C. The members of the Governing Body expressed their enthusiastic support for this invitation and decided that all countries where the textile industry occupies an important position in their national economy should be invited to send a full delegation to discuss all issues that can directly or indirectly affect the improvement of the textile industry.

Our Country Decides to Participate

The conference is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C., starting from April 2nd of this year. In addition to reducing working hours and labor conditions within the industry, the discussion will also involve important issues in the international economy of the textile industry, such as raw materials, markets, tariffs, etc. The International Labour Office has sent letters to various countries inviting them to participate. Our country is also on the list of invitees. After consultation between the government and Ambassadors Gu Shaochuan and Guo Fuchu, it was decided that, given the important position of our country's textile industry in the national economy and for the sake of promoting Sino-American relations, a delegation should be selected to attend. The Ministry of Industry was instructed to handle the matter. In addition to government representatives selected by the Ministry, the labor and management representatives will be notified to be selected by the National Federation of Commerce and Industry and the China General Chamber of Industry. The two organizations received the notification yesterday and are currently in contact. It is reported that the directors of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association and domestic textile industry leaders will be invited to a meeting on the 21st (next Monday) to discuss the matter.

The article asserts that President Chiang Kai-shek will continue to preside over the central government, and Minister Kung will continue to control finance. The newspaper praised Kung highly, saying that Kung's financial skills have restored China's international credibility. It also stated that if Kung remains the Minister of Finance, China's credit in the London market will be further consolidated, and the British side will be happy to accept debt for China's development. The London market is willing to provide huge amounts of debt, and the British government will not oppose the circulation of Chinese bonds in the London market.

### Income Tax Implementation Begins Reporting of Operating Capital

Deadline is February 28th; Chamber of Commerce continues to offer study classes and lectures

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, noting that the commercial closing period has now passed and that income tax procedures should be prepared for from the start of this session, is circulating the following information:

Start Reporting Capital

According to Article 46 of the Implementing Regulations of the Income Tax Law, companies, firms, shops, factories, and profit-making individuals should, within one month from the date of implementation of these regulations, report their names, addresses, operating capital or the actual amount of share capital to the local competent tax collection authority. The deadline for this reporting was previously announced by the Shanghai Income Tax Office as the end of January of the 25th year. Later, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce considered that the end of January of the Gregorian calendar coincided with the time when businesses were handling their closing, and the operating figures for the next year had not yet been fully determined. Therefore, it requested that the reporting period be extended to one month after the closing, i.e., until March 10th. It then received a letter from the Office, extending the deadline to the end of February. This was communicated to various associations and shops. The date for reporting capital now ends at the end of this month, leaving only a little over ten days. Businesses in various industries are preparing to handle the matter, which is very urgent. The form for the report has also been stipulated by the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance to include (1) the name of the person in charge, (2) the type of business, (3) the address of the firm, and (4) the operating capital or the actual number of shares.

Continue to Hold Meetings for Discussion

The Income Tax Special Committee organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has held three meetings to specifically discuss the draft collection guidelines, implementing regulations, and provisional regulations, and has contributed suggestions for modification. It is reported that the fourth committee meeting is scheduled to be held this afternoon. A notice has already been issued, asking experts to attend on time. In addition, the Chamber of Commerce has established an income tax study class within the supplementary school, inviting accountant Xu Yongzuo to lecture, in order to guide service personnel in various industries. Enrollment has been very enthusiastic in recent days. The lectures will begin on the 25th of this month. Also, the Chamber of Commerce's "Simple Explanation of Income Tax Regulations" explains the regulations in clear and simple language, and is very popular among buyers. The first edition of two thousand copies is about to be sold out.

Chairman's Report

Chairman He Bingsong reported that he was deeply honored that representatives from all circles in Shanghai had come to discuss the establishment of the United National Salvation Grand Alliance. Today's China cannot survive and seek survival without true unity. In the past, our country suffered from many national disasters. The reason for this is that there are still feudal remnants in the country that hinder the central government's power. Therefore, foreign insults invaded, internal troubles arose, the national power weakened day by day, and the national disaster deepened. To seek survival, the first priority is to eliminate the remnants of feudal separatism, consolidate the unified power of the central government, and realize true unity, so that military orders and political orders can be unified and concentrated. Internally, we can appease the people and govern the country, and externally, we can resist insults and save the country. All circles in Shanghai feel the importance of united national salvation. Therefore, the Grand Alliance was launched to awaken the attention of the entire country, to jointly plan and work together to urge the government to mercilessly strike at the Communist Party, the People's Front, the remaining warlords, and all traitors who are destroying China's unity. Only then can the future of the nation and race be hopeful.

Tong's Speech

Then, Municipal Party Headquarters representative Tong Xingbai delivered a speech, stating briefly that he was deeply pleased to be attending the organization of the United National Salvation Grand Alliance here today on behalf of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Since the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, it has been more than ten years. In these ten years, internal and external troubles have come one after another. The depth of the national disaster and the suffering of the people have been rare in modern history. The central government and the responsible officials of various provinces and cities have worked hard day and night to appease the people and worry about the country. It can be said that they have done their best. Why is it that the difficulties and struggles of those who bear the heavy responsibility of party and government, while internal and external worries are still deep-rooted? As the chairman reported, the reason is that the country has not yet fully achieved true unity. All counter-revolutionaries, such as the Communist Party, the People's Front, remnants of forces, and traitors, all use the power of red imperialism to destroy our central government in order to achieve true unity. Therefore, to resist foreign insults and eliminate internal worries, the first priority is to consolidate the central government and achieve true domestic unity. Only with a truly unified central government can we resist foreign insults and eliminate internal worries. The representatives of all circles in Shanghai launched the organization of a national salvation grand alliance, which can indeed understand the current malpractices and lay a solid foundation for the future of saving the country and seeking survival. I know that all compatriots in the country will definitely respond to the news. May we work together.

### Rice Merchants and Rice Shops Change to Decimal Currency System for Payment of Goods

Submission of Simplified Manufacturing Profit and Loss Statement Approved by the Bureau of Social Affairs

In the past, rice merchants and rice shops in this city mostly used small silver coins without adding surcharges for the payment of goods, and there were also cases of using inferior new coins as fillers. Recently, since the implementation of income tax, the preparation of profit and loss statements for merchants is indispensable. Rice merchants in the same industry find it difficult to calculate the losses on this kind of tail money, and they are afraid that the profit and loss report will not be accurate when paying income tax, which is a big deal. Therefore, last month, they jointly applied to the Bean and Rice Industry Association to submit to the Bureau of Social Affairs for record. In the future, all tail money for the payment of goods between rice merchants and rice shops will be changed to a decimal currency system to make it easier to accurately calculate profit and loss. Now, the reply has been received, "We have received the submission. After investigation, the tail money for the sale and purchase of goods should be calculated accurately. The requested change to the decimal auxiliary currency system is feasible. Please notify the purchasers to follow it." In the future, all tail money for the payment of goods in the rice industry should be changed to a decimal auxiliary currency system.

### Xu Geting Enters Beijing to Visit Authorities and Give a Speech on "China and Siam"

Linked by Blood and Economy, Mutual Support Should be Sought for Coexistence and Co-prosperity

Mr. Xu Geting, a standing committee member of the Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, returned to China for inspection and recently went to Beijing to visit various authorities. On the 13th of this month, the Central Executive Committee specially invited Mr. Xu to give a speech on "China and Siam" at the Central Broadcasting Station. The speech was extremely detailed, especially concerning the conditions in Siam and the situation of overseas Chinese. It serves as a reference for those concerned about overseas industrial and commercial practitioners. The following is a record of the speech:

The Largest Number of Overseas Chinese are in Siam

Siam is an independent country in Southeast Asia, located in the center of the Indochina Peninsula. It is situated in the tropics, rich in resources, and its people live in peace and contentment, resembling a utopia. Its total area is 200,148 square miles (200.148 square miles), which is even smaller than Sichuan Province in our country. The total population is 12,633,000, which is similar to the population of Fujian Province in our country. Among these more than 12 million people, overseas Chinese account for 2.5 million. It can be said that Siam is the place with the largest number of overseas Chinese in the world. Industrial and commercial enterprises in the country are almost entirely run by overseas Chinese. Our country imports more than 10 million yuan of foreign rice every year, and most of this foreign rice is also imported from Siam. The relationship between China and Siam is already so close, yet people in the motherland pay very little attention to it. The eyes of the general public are very focused on the Philippines, Malaya, Annam, and other places, and the situation in Siam is relatively ignored and alienated. For example, the boycott of Siamese rice a few years ago sparked much discussion and disagreement. This is all because there is no thorough understanding of Siam. Tonight, due to time constraints, Geting will only briefly report on the racial, political, and economic relationship between China and Siam. If it can arouse a deeper attention from people in the motherland and find a way to deal with it appropriately, that would be a very small hope for Geting.

Very Close Blood Ties Between the Two Countries

According to the research of anthropologists, the Lao and Dai ethnic groups in the current Siamese nation both belong to the Thai ethnic group. In ancient times, the Thai ethnic group lived in the southern part of our country. In the deep mountains of Guangxi and Yunnan provinces, there are still Thai ethnic groups remaining. Their languages and the language of the Siamese people have many similarities. During the Yuan Dynasty, when the Mongols conquered China, the Thai ethnic group started from Simao County in Yunnan, went south along the Lancang River and entered Baiye Province in northern Siam. Later, Han Chinese either entered Bachenburi Province and Chantaburi Province in eastern Siam from Longzhou in Guangxi via Annam, or reached the southern provinces of Pattani and Songkhla in Siam from Chaozhou and Shantou in Guangdong, Qiongya, and Xiamen in Fujian by "red-headed boats." Therefore, we can say that the Siamese nation is originally of Chinese origin. In other words, 80 percent of the Siamese people are descendants of Chinese. In particular, 90 percent of the executive leaders of the Siamese government are descendants of Han Chinese. In 1928, Geting personally listened to King Rama VII of Siam's speech at a Chinese school, "The Chinese race and the Siamese race can be said to be related. In the kingdom of Siam, the bloodlines of the people have been mixed with Chinese to an inextricable extent. Especially administrative personnel, whether they are in office or deceased, are all of Chinese descent. Even I myself contain Chinese blood cells." Furthermore, Mr. Baiwutiezai, a member of the Siamese National Assembly and President of the Supreme Court, also said in a speech at the Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in 1932, "There is absolutely no relationship in the world as close as that between the Chinese nation and the Siamese nation, because the Siamese nation can be said to have originated in China, and has been mixed together until now, just like brothers in the same family. It is impossible to distinguish who is of the father's bloodline and who is of the mother's bloodline. This is not only true for ordinary people, but also for myself, who am a descendant of the Chinese, and even the current Emperor admits to having Chinese blood components." From the speeches of King Rama VII and Mr. Baiwutiezai, it can be further proven how close the blood relationship between the two nations of China and Siam is.

National Relations Between the Two Countries Were Interrupted

Since the races of China and Siam are already so close, then the politics of the two countries naturally have a related connection. In the early centuries of the era, Siam had the establishment of the countries of Funan, Zhenla, Nanzhao, and Dali, all of which sent envoys to pay tribute. In the 13th century, the Sukhothai kingdom established by Ram Khamhaeng had great power, annexed Burma, and also came to China to pay tribute. In the 14th century, Ramathibodi I established the capital in Ayutthaya. After 34 generations, it was destroyed by Burma. Fortunately, Zheng Zhao, an overseas Chinese, gathered Chinese and Siamese patriots and Cantonese soldiers to drive out the Burmese army, restored Siamese territory, established the capital in Thonburi, and appointed Chinese as administrative officials. Everything showed a spirit of sharing together. The degree of friendship between China and Siam had reached its peak. Unfortunately, he had no son in his old age, and his son-in-law Rama I succeeded to the throne. He changed his name to Zheng Hua and continued to send envoys to repair relations with China until Rama IV. After Xianfeng, when Rama V came to power, on the one hand, China's national power was weakening day by day, and on the other hand, the power of the great powers of Britain and France was expanding. They provoked and alienated the feelings between the two countries. As a result, the connection of national relations between China and Siam for hundreds of years was cut off. To this day, diplomatic relations between the two countries have not yet been officially established. All diplomatic matters must be indirectly negotiated by the Chinese ambassador to Japan and the Siamese minister to Japan, so that the people of the two countries cannot truly understand each other and restore the spirit of sincere cooperation as before.

Economic Ties Can Still Be Maintained

Although the national relations between China and Siam have been severed, the economic ties can still be maintained for mutual development. The whole of Siam is in the tropics, the land is fertile, no fertilizer is needed, and productivity is also strong. There are many natural resources, so the people of Siam can easily maintain their livelihoods. The main products are rice, tin, teak, rubber, pomelo, stem, salt fish, pigs, cattle, poultry, coconuts, leather, pepper, mussels, etc., among which rice is the most important, accounting for 70 percent of the country's production. Ninety percent of all rice mills are in the hands of overseas Chinese. The annual output is about 3 million tons. According to Chinese customs statistics, in the 21st year of the Republic of China, the import of Siamese rice was more than 6.4 million piculs. Including other teak, fish, cowhide, pepper, and other imported goods, the total value was 43,788,800 customs taels. And our country's exports to Siam were only 3,868,800 customs taels, a difference of about 40 million taels. Fortunately, overseas Chinese remit 30 million yuan a year back to the motherland, so our country does not have such a huge deficit. Siamese exporters, importers, wholesalers, and retailers are almost entirely controlled by overseas Chinese. Even in remote rural areas, most of the businesses are run by overseas Chinese. If you go to Bangkok, the capital of Siam, you simply won't believe that you are in overseas Siam. You feel like you are still in Chaoshan in the motherland, because the signs of the shops are in Chinese, the clerks are overseas Chinese, and the language spoken is the local accent of Chaoshan. It can be seen how close the economic relationship between China and Siam is. Furthermore, Siam is an industrially backward country. Industry is not yet developed, and all daily necessities depend on Japan, with annual imports of more than 70 million yuan, accounting for 80 percent of the total imports. In recent years, our country's light industry has gradually developed. It is right for our friends to work hard to manufacture goods suitable for the local people and use the power of overseas Chinese in Siam to promote sales. In June of last year, the Chinese inspection team to Siam led by Ling Bing and Lin Kanghou gave the Siamese government and people an excellent feeling and a good impression. In October, the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Team led by Gao Kangheng held a Chinese goods exhibition in Siam, which gave overseas Chinese great excitement and excellent reviews. If the various countries in the motherland can make further efforts, it is believed that the future of our country's trade with Siam will be more effective than in other parts of Southeast Asia.

Mutual Support Should Not Be Ignored

Clinically, what we should understand is that Southeast Asia is the economic lifeline of the Chinese people, and Siam is the lifeline of our economic lifeline. We must not forget that it has abundant specialties (such as rice, teak, coconut oil) that are necessary raw materials and supplies for our country. It has millions of people of the same origin as us, and millions of Chinese-Siamese mixed descendants (on the male side, such as the intelligent and capable Prime Minister Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena and Foreign Minister Luang Praditmanutham, who can influence the Siamese regime; on the female side, such as the physically fit, beautiful, lively Siamese ladies of 1934, 1935, and 1936, who are all of Chinese descent). There are also 2.5 million pure overseas Chinese who hold commercial and economic power. We very much hope that people in the motherland will pay more attention to the Siam issue, especially that all sectors of the country, with a sincere spirit of friendship, will earnestly connect and bring Sino-Siamese relations into the right track, further promote Sino-Siamese trade, cooperate with each other, and support each other, so as to seek the common prosperity of China and Siam.

### Gliding Movement Actively Promoted

Two Gliders Created, to be Test Flown in Suzhou

Zi Jingcong, General Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, strongly advocates civil aviation. In recent years, in addition to focusing on the development of civil aviation between Europe and Asia, he has also launched the gliding movement. He has gathered people in the domestic aviation industry to organize gliding sports meetings and has invested in the construction of gliders. He has hired German technician Ha Yixin to supervise the construction of two aircraft, which are now placed at the Longhua Airport. He has submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to ask the Jiangsu Provincial Government to allow test flights at Qizi Mountain outside Suzhou. Once permission is granted, the aircraft will be transported for test flights, which will be a grand occasion. It is said that the gliding movement was first advocated in Germany. After the European War, the country was subject to restrictions on the air force, so it used aircraft without engines to train its citizens. Later, various European and American countries vigorously promoted it. It has now become a common air sport of good standing. In this upsurge of saving the country through aviation in our country, there is indeed a great significance to promote it.

### Labor Union Demands Postponement of Rickshaw Reduction

Yin Zhiling Visited Philippo Yesterday Morning, Decided to Submit Written Comments Tomorrow

Since the Public Works Bureau decided to reduce 484 public rickshaws by drawing lots on February 20, rickshaw merchants and drivers have expressed their opposition. At 9:00 yesterday morning, the Special District Rickshaw Union sent Yin Zhiling to the Public Works Bureau to petition, requesting a three-month postponement of the implementation. The Chief Executive Philippo received him and asked the military master to submit his hoped-for method in writing for further consideration. The union decided to submit the handling to the bureau tomorrow.

### Shanghai-Pudong Telegrams Change Transmission Method

In Order to be More Rapid and Convenient

The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau has now decided to change the transmission of telegrams between Shanghai and Pudong to telephone in order to expedite delivery. Previously, the bureau had a telegraph branch in Chuansha, Pudong. Later, due to organizational changes, the branch was changed to a business office.

### Car and Truck Collide, Yunfei Driver Dies Tragically

At 6:30 yesterday morning, a car No. 1258 of Yunfei Automobile Company, driving through the middle section of Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, suddenly collided with a freight truck. The driver A Long of Yunfei was ejected from the car, suffering severe head injuries. Nearby patrolmen arrived and rushed the injured driver to Renji Hospital, but he died in the hospital at 7:45 due to his serious injuries. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the mortuary for an autopsy, and reported to the Second Special District Court for examination.

### Public Works Bureau Parks Had 5 Million Visitors Throughout the Year

Most Visitors Were at the Bund Park and Jessfield Park

Last year, the number of visitors to the Public Works Bureau's parks and sports fields increased significantly, totaling 4,735,880. Among them, the Bund Park had the most visitors, followed by Jessfield Park (including the Zoo at Robison Road) and Hongkew Park. Those who entered with long-term tickets accounted for seven-tenths, those who purchased temporary tickets accounted for two-tenths, and the rest were visitors to various sports fields, who were generally not charged. Last year,

Three New Sports Fields Were Added

One was at the intersection of Bubbling Well Road and Great Western Road, divided into east and west sections. The west section was specially for children to play, and the east section was for adults, with a small football field. The other two were children's sports fields, one on Dahua Road and one on Guangxin Road. However, because the land on Guangxin Road was diverted for other uses, the sports field there was soon closed.

Many Trees and Shrubs

In Jessfield Park were transplanted in order to expand the lawn. The botanical garden was also expanded. A two-foot-wide road was paved from the park to the zoo for the convenience of visitors. There were many other improvements, such as the addition of pavilions and the expansion of the rose garden. Various kinds of trees and flowers were gradually planted. Various rare birds and animals in the zoo are naturally

Attracted the Attention of Visitors

Hongkew Park has been slightly expanded because a vacant lot to the west of the shooting range has been incorporated into the park. Drainage work on the ball field has been completed. An old pavilion has been removed and rebuilt. Various flowers have been added to the park to decorate it. The flowers and trees in Jiaozhou Park are quite flourishing, with

Roses Being the Best

The public's interest in the sports fields in the park is increasing day by day. The flowers and trees in Huishan Park are relatively few, but it is hoped that more will be added in the future. There have also been many improvements in the Bund Park. For example, the lawn on the south side has been redesigned and wide walkways have been paved. The central artificial hill has been demolished, and

A Fountain has Been Rebuilt

In its place. The original food and beverage vending area has been moved to the

New House in the Northwest Corner

The park is planted with beautiful flowers for people to enjoy. Other visitors to various sports fields are constantly flowing. The Kunshan Road sports field is particularly crowded. Many of the trees planted on both sides of the roads at various places have been removed due to widening roads or

Adding Buildings

One side of lawn has been laid between Jiaozhou Road and Avenue Haig and between Avenue Foch and Weihaiwei Road, and fenced with iron railings. All have been completed. In Jessfield, Hongkew, and the Bund Parks, string music and military music were played 9 to 23 times each last summer. The largest audience was more than 18,000 people.

### Accomplices in Private Counterfeiting Case Continue to be Arrested

Shi Wanjin Arrested, Awaiting Joint Trial

Feng Baishun, Chinese detective of the Chengdu Road Police Station, and detectives Pang Yutang, Sun Wenxi, etc., previously arrested ten suspects in the private counterfeiting of Central Bank coins, including Lu Yongqing, Qian Yinsheng, Chen Tianxin, Guo Chunxuan, Chen Xiwei, Sun Kunsheng, Wang Bolu, Huang Tuzhi, Zhang Boting, Wang Mingqing, etc., at Room 43 of Yuanyuan Hotel at No. 520 Jiujiang Road, and confiscated a large number of counterfeit coins, and escorted them to the First Special Court for interrogation and investigation. This was reported in this newspaper. Now it is learned that in the case which was rescheduled, suspect Wang Bolu confessed that Shi Wanjin of Tongzhou, a principal offender in the case, resided at No. 290 Rue de Remi in the French Concession. The Chinese and Western detectives went to Rue de Remi with the suspect Wang at 6:30 in the morning to cooperate with the detectives of the French Police Station to arrest Shi Wanjin, took him to the police station for detention, and escorted him to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special Court. The police station lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, saying that when the defendant was arrested, he denied being Shi Wanjin and lied that his surname was Wang. Later, his seal was seized, with the inscription "Shi Wanjin Yin," and he began to admit it. A five-yuan counterfeit coin of the Central Bank, a one-yuan counterfeit coin, a five-yuan banknote of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, six counterfeit dual-cent tickets of the Farmers and Workers Bank, five counterfeit five-fen legal tender coins, and papers were seized at his home. The trial of the suspects Lu Yongqing and others in the previous case has been rescheduled to the 20th of this month, and a joint interrogation should be requested. The defendant Shi Wanjin confessed that he did not admit it, saying that Lu Yongqing, who was arrested in the case, was actually named Shen Yaoting. I have a grudge against Shen, which led to being falsely accused. Judge Huang Risheng examined the confession and ruled that Shi should be detained pending a rescheduled joint interrogation on the 20th.

### Gangsters Extorted Money in Private Counterfeiting Case Using Cigarette Cases as Signals

Two Gangsters Arrested in Baoyu Lane, Each Sentenced to Imprisonment After Trial

Zhang Yixing, manager of Zhang Yixing Ham Company at No. 7 Wuzhou Road, a native of Xiapu, Fujian, received as many as eleven extortion letters from gangsters between December 27 of last year and February 6 of this year. The words were quite fierce, stating that no later than 3:00 p.m. on the 7th, he had to prepare 700 yuan, put it in a large British brand red box, and send someone to contact him near the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, otherwise the bullets would be merciless and prepare a coffin to die. Zhang Zhengxi then reported the situation to the Jiading Road Police Station. Chinese detective Shao Jingfan, deputy detective Yao Yuanlong, detectives Xu Yongyuan, Ma Bingzhang, and detective Chen Ruisheng disguised themselves as tea servants in the Zhongnan Hotel and, together with Zhang's accountant Zhou Guangyu, held a British brand red box containing the money and waited at the appointed time, observing the movements. A Ningbo native, Wang Abiao, arrived and told Zhou Guangyu to go to Baoyu Lane across the street to talk. As soon as he entered the lane, a gangster, Wang Zhiqing, a native of Suzhou, rushed forward and asked Zhou if he was a representative of Zhang Yixing. When Zhou said yes, he took the cigarette case and was about to escape when the detectives rushed forward, arrested the two Wangs, took them to the police station, and escorted them to the First Special District Court for trial and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing came to Criminal Division 3 for investigation and trial. The Public Works Bureau lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the accomplices in the rescheduled case could not be arrested, and now he was prosecuting for attempted extortion under Article 346, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, and requested severe punishment. Wang Abiao confessed that he was asked to go by his friend Li Yonggui, i.e., Ji Yongsheng, and did not know about the extortion letter. He asked for leniency. Wang Zhiqing's confession was vague. Judge Zhong sentenced Wang Abiao to two years and two months of imprisonment and Wang Zhiqing to two years. The extortion letter was confiscated.

### Robbery and Assault in Guangzhao Road

Six Robbers Posing as Gods of Wealth Stole More Than 600 Yuan

At about 3:40 yesterday morning, while the Shunchang Dyeing Factory at No. 231 Guangzhao Road, Zhabei, was welcoming the God of Wealth and the sound of firecrackers was deafening, several people suddenly came, claiming to be the God of Wealth, holding wooden ingots, called "jumping God of Wealth," making all kinds of ugly gestures, and then putting the wooden ingots on the table. In an instant, six robbers wearing various colored long and short clothes and speaking in Jiangbei dialect, one robber holding a box cannon and one robber holding a Browning pistol, drove the factory family into a room, forbidding them to make a sound. Two robbers were on guard at the entrance, and one robber broke into the bedroom of the factory's mistress Wu Fengshi and the bedroom of Fengshi's daughter-in-law Yuan, rummaging through boxes and cabinets. At that time, because Fengshi shouted for help, she was hit in the head with the butt of a gun by one of the robbers, and her injuries were quite serious. As a result, the robbers stole more than 180 yuan in legal tender, two gold rings from the hands of Fengshi and Yuan, a pair of gold earrings and a pocket watch from Yuan's ears, eight silver lockets, many gray rat, sheepskin, camel fleece, and men's and women's silk and woolen long gowns and short coats, for a total loss of more than 600 yuan. Yesterday, the factory owner Wu Yushou (a native of Nanjing) had issued a loss list and reported it to the Hengfeng Road Police Station, which had jurisdiction. After receiving the report, Police Chief Lu Pei, in addition to reporting it to the Inspectorate of the Police General Bureau, sent officers to the house of the principal to investigate and ordered the police detectives under his jurisdiction to strictly investigate and arrest the robbers.

### Russians Gathered to Gamble in a Cafe

The Location Belonged to an Extra-Settlement Road, Transferred to the District Court

The International Cafe at No. 1409 Yu Garden Road was opened by a Russian, Victor Akman. Recently, the Jing'an Temple Police Station learned that there were people gathering to gamble in the cafe, so Western Detective Tong En and Chinese Detective Wu Chengmo investigated and learned that it was indeed the case.

### Lawsuit Against Real Estate Company Shareholders for Breach of Trust and Embezzlement

Chen Zhang and Lin Ziwei from Fujian, together with their fellow villagers and relatives, including Xu Kaimin (38 years old, an engineer residing in Beiping), jointly established Zhiyuan Real Estate Company in Shanghai in June of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Chen invested 3,000 yuan, Lin invested 1,000 yuan, and Xu invested 5,000 yuan. In October of the same year, Lin Yuqing joined with an investment of 1,000 yuan. The company name was changed to Tong'an Gongxing. Initially, no contract was signed. Later, due to insufficient capital for building houses, they mortgaged 11,000 yuan from Shengsheng Bank. In April of the following year, Chen and Lin Ziwei requested to withdraw their shares, which were taken over by Xu Kaimin. Xu then went to Beiping to perform business, and the company's business was entrusted to shareholder Lin Yuqing for management. However, after Chen Zhang and Lin Ziwei withdrew their shares, they discovered that Xu Kaimin and Lin Yuqing had breached their trust and embezzled and falsely reported expenses, such as building houses, mortgage expenses, land rent commissions, and entertainment salaries, amounting to several thousand yuan. Unable to resolve the matter through negotiation, Chen, Lin, and Xu hired lawyers to file a private prosecution for breach of trust and embezzlement against Xu Kaimin and Lin Yuqing in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, with an attached civil lawsuit to recover the embezzled funds. The court, based on the complaint, yesterday appointed Judge Sun Pengxian to conduct a preliminary hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Lin Ziwei, accompanied by his lawyer, appeared in court to provide testimony, outlining Chen's reasons for the lawsuit. The two defendants hired lawyer Ge Zhiqin to defend them, presenting counter-evidence, accounting books, and other items for the points raised in the lawsuit, and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. After the court hearing, which lasted two hours, and the examination of witness Shi Xuehai, the verdict was scheduled for another hearing at 2:00 PM on the 22nd.

### Shipwreck

Chang'an Aground at Haizhou

The Chang'an, a ship of the Liji Shipping Company with a deadweight of 1,491 tons, recently experienced high water levels in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Xunhan section had a draft of 16 feet, and the Jiujiang to Wuhu section had reached over 17 feet. Not only could large river ships pass through smoothly, but even sea ships could navigate. The Chang'an was heading to Haizhou to load salt that had accumulated due to shallow waters in the Yangtze River to transport it to the upper reaches. Yesterday, the Liji Shipping Company received a telegram from the Chang'an's shipowner, stating that the ship had run aground at the port of Haizhou and was stuck in a shallow beach, unable to move. They were planning to wait for the tide to rise and then attempt to tow it out. If it could not be towed out, they would have to unload the cargo.

Shihe Collides with Chunli

The Shihe, a ship of the Gongqi Shipping Company with a deadweight of 1,513 tons, was transporting a large amount of salt from Haizhou, as the Yangtze River's rising water level allowed for transportation. The ship set sail from Nanjing to load cargo at Shierxu. At 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, the ship passed the Wusongkou. Due to heavy fog on the sea surface, the Zhengji's Chunli, which had just departed from Shanghai, encountered the fog at Songkou and dared not venture further, anchoring to wait. Unexpectedly, the passing Shihe could not see it in the fog and continued to advance. It was not until it approached that it saw the Chunli, but it was too late to avoid it, and it collided with the Chunli. The Shihe's outer iron plate on the left side was hit with a large hole. Fortunately, it was near the upper platform deck, and seawater did not seep in. The bow of the Chunli was also damaged. After the two ships collided, they reported to their respective companies, and the United Ship Insurance Association sent surveyor Xu Zufan to Songkou to inspect the damage. Workers were hired to repair the damage immediately. Since the damage to both ships was above the load line, it did not affect navigation, and both ships sailed as usual yesterday.

### Road Workers of the Public Works Department Request Mr. Yu's Assistance Again

The Public Works Department Will Draw Lots Again; Workers Request Serious Negotiations

According to the Great Community, the road workers of the Public Concession are panicking due to the Public Works Department's plan to reduce staff by drawing lots. A strike broke out, and it was only after Mr. Yu Qiaqing and other Chinese directors stepped in to mediate that work resumed. Now, the Public Works Department will draw lots again on the 28th of this month. Upon hearing the news, the workers believe that the Public Works Department has violated the mediation decision. Yesterday, they sent representatives Li Jingchun, Liu Huanwen, Wang Shuangcai, Huan Buying, and Cai Furong to Mr. Yu Qiaqing to petition, requesting serious negotiations. Mr. Yu received them and promised assistance. The letter to Mr. Yu is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, the previous strike was caused by the government's reduction of staff, and we were fortunate to have your great compassion and consideration for the suffering of the laborers, which allowed for a satisfactory resolution. You approved the reinstatement of our original 1,200+ road workers, ensuring that no one would be laid off and that we would continue to work according to the old rules, abandoning the method of drawing lots for layoffs and giving priority to work assignments. Road workers and ditch workers would each have their own responsibilities and would not encroach on each other's duties. If work could not be assigned due to rainy or snowy weather, alternative relief measures would be devised. To prevent abuses by foremen, it was proposed to issue hats with names on them for identification purposes, to avoid abuses and save expenses. The road workers were touched by the news and expressed their support, obeying the order to resume work. The road workers have long admired your reputation and believe that they can rest assured. You repeatedly instructed that if any foreman deliberately sabotaged or laid off road workers without reason, we could report to you at any time for investigation. However, not long after, Xu Huisheng, a foreman in the Suzhou Road district, harbored ulterior motives and planned to take back our road worker badges and issue new ones. The new badges were of the same style for road workers, ditch workers, long-term workers, and short-term workers. If our district has 200 road workers, Foreman Xu plans to issue 400 new badges (i.e., 200 road worker badges and 200 ditch worker and short-term worker badges). If the project only requires 200 people in the future, Foreman Xu can use his own people first. Not only will ditch workers encroach on road worker positions, but our real road workers will be eliminated. There is no greater poison in this plan. If this trend continues, the livelihoods of our 1,200+ road workers will be cut off. Therefore, we are compelled to appeal to you to uphold justice and maintain the previous agreement. If the Public Works Department must change to new badges, they must be of different styles, with road workers, ditch workers, long-term workers, and short-term workers each having their own style, so as to avoid disputes. This is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chinese Director."

### Streetcar Workers of the Public Concession Negotiated Directly Yesterday

Mediation to Continue Today

According to the Great Community, more than 2,000 workers, including ticket sellers, drivers, conductors, and doormen, of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramways Co. in the Public Concession, went on a joint strike on the 9th of this month to demand improved treatment. After the party and government authorities and the Federation of Labor sent personnel to mediate, four resolutions were made. All workers returned to work as usual on the morning of the 10th. Regarding the ten demands put forward by the workers, Yang Zhaoyu from the Baixin Station and Yang Boqing from the Old Station were sent as plenipotentiary representatives to the head office on North Suzhou Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to meet with General Manager Evan and Business Manager [unclear], resulting in a very good situation. The company has agreed to increase wages by two yuan per person per month. The other conditions will be considered and implemented separately. However, the workers believe that there is still a large gap between the company's offer and their demands, so they have not accepted it. It is now decided that the party and government authorities and the Federation of Labor will send personnel to meet with the workers' representatives at the company again this afternoon to negotiate in order to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

Expansion of Public Debt Use

Can Be Used to Convert Larger Denominations into Smaller Ones: Thus, They Do Not Hesitate to Buy at a Lower Price

New High Prices Appear One After Another: Class A Actually Rises One Yuan and Four Cents

Yesterday at the Chinese Stock Exchange, the market opened in the red as usual. Following the previous practice, only two trading sessions were conducted in the morning, limited to one week. Market sentiment was thriving, showing a tendency to rise sharply. Class A bonds, after a long period of sluggishness, rebounded particularly strongly. The Revival Public Bond surged three yuan, and there were still no goods available to buy on the trading floor. The confidence of the people and the scarcity of chips were unparalleled. All public bonds, except Class A, found new high prices. Many brokers, after selling in the first session, immediately bought in the second session to go long. The main reason, it is said, is that the reserve ratio for the financial sector will be changed to four in cash and six in securities. The buying by the financial sector is entirely for its own needs. In addition, there were many short positions carried over from the previous year, and the replenishment was even more enthusiastic. It is believed that the Third Plenary Session will proceed smoothly, and both diplomatic and internal strife have been resolved. Therefore, the future of the bond market is likely to see an unexpected surge. The initial session started with a rising trend, but it was not yet vigorous, because there were still many short positions and long positions coming out. The trend often went from high to low. Numbers 50 and 72 had sales, while numbers 5, 35, and 43, etc., had the most purchases. Although all rose by one dime to half a yuan, the trend was still peaceful, which is often the phenomenon of a red market. In the second session, the financial sector absorbed wildly. Numbers 10 and 77 had the most purchases, and numbers 50 and 72 also turned to buying. Retail investors also gradually covered their positions. Market sentiment gradually recovered, and Class A futures surged by more than one yuan. The demand on the trading floor was still insatiable. Although only five thousand Revival Public Bonds were traded, due to the lack of goods, they were forced up by three yuan, and the short positions were still uncovered. Uniform Public Bonds all rose by four dimes and a half to one yuan and four dimes and a half. The total turnover was 6,375,000 yuan. The resulting increase and decrease are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

### Yarn and Cotton

Commodity Prices Expected to Rise Again

Yarn and Cotton First Fall, Then Soar

16,000 Bales of Yarn in Stock Seem Beneficial to Selling: It Is Also Reported That Chips Will Be Expanded, Which Is Beneficial to Buying

The yarn market, closed for six days during the Spring Festival holiday, opened for business yesterday. The market condition was that prices fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. However, demand for spot yarn from customers is still strong, more active than at the end of last year. Therefore, Indian merchants are tightening their grip on February-term standard yarn and are not letting go. However, general industry shorts, seeing the increase in warehouse yarn inventory, which has reached 16,000 bales, have lost their desire to encourage selling. Rumors of good news suddenly arose in the afternoon, and the buying trend revived.

Indian Merchants Still Maintaining Long Positions

The opening of the standard yarn market saw a consistent decline in all months, and the momentum was very weak. This is because the overseas cotton industry situation has not developed during this holiday period, yarn sales have been sluggish, and market sentiment has relaxed. A certain merchant released a large volume of inventory. However, Indian merchants were still pulling in inventory in the February term and below. After the second session, they maintained their position without moving. Spot yarn trading was still considered good. The result of the standard yarn market was that each month fell by one yuan, six dimes, seven dimes, and eight dimes compared to the closing price of the previous year. The market opened in the afternoon, and the longs came to pull in again, and rumors of good news revived. Buyers were active, and market prices rose slowly. At the same time, the three-grade yarn market rebounded, and market sentiment became more bullish. The result of the standard yarn market was that each month rose by one yuan, two dimes, four dimes, five dimes to two yuan compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that 1,300 bales of Deda were sold, 1,300 bales of Tongji, 6,550 bales of Yuda, 850 bales of Mingde, 3,050 bales of Hexing, 2,300 bales of Yichang, 4,650 bales of Changfeng, 3,750 bales of Runkang, 1,200 bales of Fukang, and 750 bales of Wang Taixing. 5,950 bales of Jinchang were bought, 850 bales of Hengyi, 1,450 bales of Zhenda, 1,050 bales of Daqing, 1,250 bales of Renfeng, 1,800 bales of Xiacheng, 1,350 bales of Dachang, 1,000 bales of Yuanyi, 2,600 bales of Dachangcheng, and 950 bales of Hengchang. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Yarn Sales Weak at 1,500 Bales

The spot yarn sales market is still considered good. It was found that a total of 1,478 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day. The selling price fell by one or two yuan in the morning, and then rebounded by one yuan in the afternoon. The purchase amount of each group is listed below.

Fixed Date for Yarn and Cotton Delivery This Month

The delivery date for the standard yarn and cotton futures of the previous month is now set for the 26th of this month. Trading of February-term yarn and cotton will be suspended for three days (23rd, 24th, and 25th). The market will be closed on the delivery date.

The cotton market initially fell, then firmed, and a rising trend revived. This is because the sources of supply from all directions are withering. It was rumored in the afternoon that the circulating chips on the market would be increased. The gold industry groups also came to buy. At the same time, short positions were covered. Longs and shorts were advancing side by side, and the rising momentum became even more intense.

Active Buying of Standard Cotton Futures in the Afternoon

The standard cotton market was extremely quiet, and trading in the market was not seen to be smooth. Because Indian and American cotton are still stuck in a sideways pattern, market sentiment still lacks excitement. The result of the standard cotton market was that each month fell by one dime to two dimes compared to the closing price of the previous year. The market opened in the afternoon, and rumors arose in the market, all favorable to the longs. There were many buyers, and market prices became more and more popular. The result was that each month rose by three dimes and a half to five dimes and a half compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that 1,400 loads of Jinchang were sold, 1,100 loads of Yuanda, 1,000 loads of Dafeng, 1,600 loads of Tongji, 3,100 loads of Daji, 2,400 loads of Hexing, 9,200 loads of Gengfeng, 1,300 loads of Fengtai, 1,500 loads of Renfeng, 2,200 loads of Changfeng, 1,200 loads of Yuanxingchang, 1,600 loads of Daqing, 3,900 loads of Wang Taixing, 1,900 loads of Taichang, 2,300 loads of Yichang, and 1,600 loads of Xiacheng. 3,300 loads of Hengyi were bought, 1,800 loads of Dachang, 2,000 loads of Chengji, 3,400 loads of Xiacheng, 2,600 loads of Xinchang, 6,300 loads of Changhe, 2,700 loads of Mingde, 5,200 loads of Dachangcheng, and 2,000 loads of Runkang. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

East Goods and Fine Cloth Trading Are Most Active

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened in the red, and the situation was very good. The opening price of white goods, fine cloth, and coarse cloth, rose by five cents per bolt. Fine twill and coarse twill were relatively stable. Among the colored goods, the spring-selling printed cloth suddenly rose by two dimes per bolt, and light-colored printed goods rose by one dime per bolt. Striped plain poplin, dark-colored blue cloth, serge, and colored twill were not very prosperous. Bleached cloth and striped bleached cloth also increased by one dime to four dimes. In the morning, the market sentiment was slightly looser due to the decline in cotton yarn. East goods and fine cloth were five cents lower than the red market price. Many groups from Changjiang and Tianjin purchased them. In the afternoon, the yarn market rebounded, and spot yarn sales were brisk. The Tianjin group absorbed a large amount of fine cloth, purchasing more than 500 bales. The market recovered. Japanese companies opened 200 bales of Longtou fine cloth. The Cantonese group also had good intake, ordering nearly 200 bales of coarse cloth and fine cloth from local factories, and ordering more than 200 boxes of mandarin duck poplin and plain poplin. The Hunan group purchased two hundred and dozens of pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, colored twill, and blue cloth from local factories. Other groups also had small transactions. Most have to wait for the red market price list to be reported before replying to add more.

### Grain

Foreign Wheat Continues to Rise

Flour Futures Rise to the Limit of One Dime

Yesterday, the flour market showed a sudden jump in all months. Since the Spring Festival market closure, foreign wheat prices have risen continuously. Both Chicago and Canada consistently raised prices by five cents, totaling two yuan. Liverpool rose by one and a half pence. During the closure, factory spot flour was once priced at four yuan and one dime. Due to these reasons, the two, three, and four months opened with a full one dime price increase. Therefore, trading was not very smooth and came to a halt. New flour for July also initially rose by nine cents, but then fell back by two or three cents due to factory hedging. In the current situation, if the international situation does not change,

Wheat Futures Prices Are Also Rising Sharply

Factories Have Already Started Buying Spot Wheat

Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw a sharp rise in prices for all months since the market closure. Both Chicago and Canada rose by about two yuan, and Liverpool rose by one and a half pence. Due to these international comparisons, both internal and external market sentiment rose in unison. The recent three months all rose by about one dime and a half. New wheat for June and July rose by nine cents to one dime and one or two cents. Later, because the opening price immediately rose, although trading was smooth, the market stalled. The subsequent situation will depend on the flour market. In the spot wheat market, factories have already started to take delivery. Because standard prices have risen sharply, each grade has also increased by one dime. Kaiyang River, Guandian, and Bengbu wheat was six yuan and seven dimes, Anqing, Nanjing, and Shaoxing wheat was six yuan and six dimes, Jiangbei, Luhe, and Wuyi wheat was six yuan and six dimes and a half, Hefei wheat was six yuan and three dimes and a half, Hankou car wheat was six yuan and six dimes, and Yanghe Chao wheat was six yuan and two dimes. Fuxin purchased 5,000 bags, and Shenda purchased 2,000 bags.

Due to Spring Festival customary practice, the flour and miscellaneous grains exchanges will only open for trading in the morning and close in the afternoon from yesterday to the 20th. From the 21st, they will fully open for trading in both the morning and afternoon.

Soybean Oil Cake Has Not Recovered

Foreign Sesame Oil Alone Rises One Dime

The standard soybean oil cake market was reported to be small at the end of the year, and traders had been selling off. Although actual sales were active, the standard market remained weak. Standard oil fell by two dimes to one dime and five cents, standard cake by one or two cents, and standard beans by four or five cents to nine cents. However, in the afternoon, a telegram came reporting a price increase, and spot prices were uniformly raised. Therefore, it is expected that the market will recover today, because the current soybean oil cake market is completely dependent on the linked market.

The spot market for miscellaneous grains and soybean oil cake has officially opened for red market trading. However, the atmosphere in the market is not as exciting as in previous years. The main reason is that most traders have inventory in hand, so the overall trend is moderate. The market price of soybean oil has not changed much, but peanut oil has fallen by two dimes. Soybean cake was stable in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with a total of 70,000 to 80,000 pieces traded. The destination was Shantou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, and the interior. The same was true for soybeans. The oil mills purchased nine truckloads of Bengbu beans, one truckload of Linhuai Pass beans, and twenty-one truckloads of Siping Street beans. Xicheng beans were sent to Shantou in three or four trucks. Other scattered transactions included one truckload of Fanjiatun beans, 200 bags of Dingjiazhou beans, and 600 to 700 bags of Dudousha yellow beans. Foreign sesame oil was priced at 14 yuan and nine dimes during the big closing. Yesterday, the market rose by one dime, opening at 15 yuan. The Central Trust Bureau purchased 700 tons. The overall trend is firm, and future purchases are relentless, and it may even break out of Guanwai.

Customer Xian Rice Is Quite Active

Yesterday, customer xian rice trading was quite active. Guangzhou merchants were very keen to purchase. However, intake of brown rice was slightly weaker, and there was more inventory and new arrivals on the market, so the market remained stagnant. There were about 100,000 bags of customer xian rice newly arrived at the end of the year, and brown rice accounted for the majority. Although machine rice inventory was sufficient, the market jumped by one dime yesterday because the stores and Guangdong group were active and it was cheaper than river rice. Round rice and round grain rice each rose by five or six cents. A total of 9,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3,445 bags of Hunan rice, 1,220 bags of Hansha rice, 2,500 bags of Wenzhou rice, and 2,100 bags of Jiaxing brown foreign rice were opened.

Few Rice Loads Opened in North Shanghai Rice Market

Since the Shanghai North rice market cleared accounts at the end of the lunar year, the Suzhou River godowns and factories have 274,000 shih of brown and white japonica and xian rice in stock. There are about 90 boats in the river and newly arrived. Only 20 shops opened for business yesterday, and several shops temporarily suspended business. There were few merchants entering the market yesterday, so there were few transactions. Both shop owners and customers were just being polite. The prices of each grade opened were increased compared to the closing price by three dimes or less. White japonica and thin rice prices rose by about three dimes, Yangbu Dujian rose by two dimes, and Baiyuan rose by two dimes and a half. Customer grain rose by one dime. Early rice and Yinyuan lacked goods and did not open.

Moreover, the source of supply from various groups in South Shanghai, including those who arrived in Shanghai at the end of the year, totaled 80 to 90, with a total of 18,450 shih of goods. Among them, thin rice accounted for 46 to 47. Although the sales market was mostly for New Year red market business, stores and rural areas had moved, and there were also Tianjin Tanggu Qingyan and other groups purchasing more than 4,000 bags of thin rice, so the market situation was good. The prices of both thick and thin japonica rice increased by two dimes, and Duyang grain and Yinyuan were also prosperous.

However, the spot number was unusually healthy, and the phenomenon of opening spot deliveries was quite strong, and it was still easy to pull up.

Under the replenishment and purchase of Tongtaichang, Fuxing Yongyi, Yu Shengyuan, and Hengyu, it rose to five yuan and six dimes. Because the swap actually had a tendency to flatten out, Qingfa Yong took the opportunity to supply at a high price, and the closing was 1,155 yuan and three dimes. There was a fluctuation of one yuan and eight dimes during the day. As a result, it rebounded by two yuan compared to before the holiday.

The settlement price was 1,156 yuan and four dimes, a standard gold price listed by the Central Bank, which was about one yuan lower than the closing price.

The buying price added 12 yuan, and Tianjin goods added 14 yuan, but there were few transactions. The Central Bank has been continuously opening spot purchases of about 400 bars in recent days, with the price being uniformly 1,155 yuan, which has affected the swap in this session a lot.

Qiafeng Yongcheng Dayu Xinxing Dachangxiang Yuanmao Yong Dafeng Heng, etc., were on the selling side. Fuxing Yong first sold and then bought, and Qingfa Yong first advanced and then exited.

Also, Jian dealers’ top and middle grade dried longan opened at 27 yuan and a half, all showing increases compared to before the major settlement. It was found that the North goods industry and the dried longan industry, except for a few that were flat, generally had profits. Some even increased their capital. Moreover, Kun Yuan added Xin Jia Qin Kee, with a capital of 36,000 yuan. Also, the new firm Tong Chun has a capital of 30,000 yuan.

### Silk and Tea

Planning to Develop Overseas Trade of Black and Green Tea

Intending to Organize a Trading Company to Manage it

The overseas trade of Chinese tea, since the unification of the transportation and sales of Qining black tea by the governments of Anhui and Zhejiang provinces last year, has been effective. Therefore, it is highly valued. The four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Fujian all have preparations for unified production and sales, and the authorities of Anhui and Jiangxi are engaged in contact. It is learned that the Minister of Industry believes that the overseas trade of Chinese tea is of great importance to economic construction and has drafted opinions and regulations. A Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank has been specially dispatched to contact the authorities of the above six provinces and instructed the Shanghai Foreign Tea Industry Association to participate. The method is to be jointly operated by the government and merchants, organizing a Chinese Tea Trading Company in Shanghai, with a fixed capital of two million yuan, shared equally by the government and merchants, as a unified sales agency, and actively improving production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales matters. After learning of the above news, the tea shop colleagues in this city held an emergency meeting at the industry association yesterday to discuss countermeasures. According to past practice, the act of each shop receiving the god to determine their business, was temporarily suspended yesterday. Observing the current situation, it is inevitable that the unified export of black and green tea will be implemented.

Silk Weaving Has Not Yet Started

Due to the abolition of the lunar New Year, all foreign firms in this port were closed for four days. Yesterday, all businesses resumed. However, the market was quiet and there were no transactions all day. Because Chinese silk merchants had scarce goods in hand and overseas silk prices were firm, their attitude was firm. When foreign firms requested telegrams, they generally held high prices. Therefore, it was still difficult for the two parties to approach an agreement.

Overseas Markets: Silk prices in Japan and the United States have gradually risen in the past few days. The opening price on the New York Stock Exchange has gradually risen from $1.90 to $1.97. All spot silk products have also been raised by 3 cents. (Yesterday was Sunday, no market.) The Yokohama market was quite firm. The spot price opened at 885 yen yesterday, up 5 yen. The futures price opened at 847 yen, down 1 yen.

### Frontier Communication

— Lü Bing

Speaking of frontier communication, I suddenly recalled two things from the late Qing Dynasty:

(1) During the Tongzhi period, the Russian army invaded Yili. At that time, the Qing court was completely unaware. Later, they received a notification from the Russian side and then understood that this important frontier location had fallen into the hands of the Russian army. If Russia had secretly not informed them at that time, and the frontier officials had been afraid of being punished and dared not immediately report to the throne, the Qing court might have been kept in the dark for even longer.

(2) During the Sino-French War, Liu Yongfu, Feng Zicai, and others fought desperately in the Zhennanguan area, almost defeating the French army. However, the news was delayed. The Qing court not only did not know the victory or defeat at the front, but even mistakenly believed rumors that the front had been defeated. Therefore, they immediately ordered the withdrawal of troops and negotiated peace with France.

Looking at the above two incidents, one realizes how important frontier communication is! If the loss of frontier territory is unknown, and the victory or defeat at the front is unclear, what kind of country is it? This was in the late Qing Dynasty, when communication equipment was rudimentary, so it is no wonder. However, since the founding of the Republic of China, several incidents have occurred in Mongolia, Tibet, Gansu, and Xinjiang. In the beginning, the news was chaotic, and later the inside story gradually became known. The time elapsed in between was often several days. The communication between the central government or the interior and the frontier has not achieved rapid progress. It is not only inconvenient for transportation but also feels dangerous for national defense.

The telecommunications industry is run by the state to enable comprehensive planning and not solely for profit. Its vision extends beyond the convenience of communication in the interior provinces and also seeks to ensure the accessibility of news in remote areas, so that in the event of an incident, news can be obtained immediately and strategies can be decided immediately. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications' telecommunications facilities have been based on the principles mentioned above. The wired telecommunications and telephone lines in the Jin-Sui area have long had full connections, which goes without saying. In addition, the establishment of wireless radio communication stations has also increased year by year. Those that have been completed include Lhasa, Kangding, Ba'an, Dengke, Xining, Jiuquan, Dingxi, Jingyuan, Ningxia, Erlizi River, Guihua, Dongsheng, Dushikou, Chicheng, Yulin, Pingliang, and Tianshui, a total of seventeen locations, along with two dedicated radio stations for Zhangjia and Panchen. The Lanzhou radio station has also been expanded to improve communication efficiency. Those under construction include Gongpoquan, Dingyuan, and Yingheguan stations. Although we cannot say that expanding these radio stations and circuits is sufficient for frontier defense communications, we can at least say that the news from the frontier will no longer be isolated, nor will it be delayed and lose its effectiveness. In the recent Suiyuan War, the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers at the front prevented the bandits and puppets from invading, but the convenience of transportation and communication also contributed a lot. In order to seek the consolidation of national defense, we should naturally have prior preparations for national defense communications. This is worth reporting to the public.

### Expansion of Long-Distance Wireless Telephone by the Ministry of Communications

— Bao Zhen

Since the establishment of the international radio station by the Ministry of Communications between China and Japan, it has spared no effort in promoting domestic and international long-distance wireless telephones. For example, since the opening of long-distance wireless telephone service between Shanghai and Guangzhou in early December last year, it has begun preparations for wireless telephone communication between Shanghai and Hong Kong. The method is to use the wireless circuit between Shanghai and Guangzhou and the existing wired circuit between Guangzhou and Hong Kong to connect with each other to provide direct communication between Shanghai and Hong Kong. During the preparation period of the Shanghai-Hong Kong wireless telephone, tests were repeatedly conducted, and the sound transmission was very clear. Experts designed and installed security equipment, so its secrecy is very reliable. After consultation between Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hong Kong, it was officially opened for communication on February 1 this year. The daily business hours are set from 7:00 am to 9:00 pm. The communication price is 7 yuan and 50 cents per ordinary call (an additional 50 cents per call in the Shanghai concession). The Shanghai-Hankou wireless telephone officially opened for communication on September 1 in Shanghai. The above-mentioned long-distance wireless telephone is still a pioneering undertaking in our country, which benefits the commercial communication between Shanghai, Guangdong, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, Hankou. Furthermore, the wireless telephone between Hankou and Guangdong is currently under preparation, and it can also be officially opened for communication soon.

Since the establishment of the nine-province long-distance telephone by the Ministry of Communications, the construction of domestic wired long-distance telephone lines has been completed one after another, with a total of 5,077 kilometers of wired lines. Major cities within the nine provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, and Hebei have now successively opened communication. There are quite a number of long-distance telephone users. Recently, long-distance telephone service between Shanghai and Yuezhou, Changsha, and between Nanchang and Guling, Jiujiang, Zhengzhou, Xuzhou, Xinyang, and Luoyang has been officially opened for communication since February 1 this year. After the communication of the above-mentioned places, the major cities between Jiangsu and Hunan provinces and between Jiangxi and Henan provinces can be connected to each other for communication, which is extremely convenient for public communication in these places. Furthermore, since the opening of the above-mentioned inter-provincial long-distance telephone service, merchants in the above-mentioned places can use it for ordering, urging payment, and other matters. The above-mentioned long-distance telephone allows merchants to discuss and connect with the other party's businesses, which is the same as face-to-face conversation, which is very convenient. Therefore, the increase in long-distance telephone communication locations can not only increase the convenience of public communication but also benefit commerce and promote market prosperity.

The materials and components of the long-distance telephone lines of the Ministry of Communications are all of a certain standard, so when the provinces connect with each other for communication, the sound waves are very clear, and there is no interference. Between two cities with a long distance, an amplifier is installed in the middle telecommunications bureau, so as not to reduce the sound waves and prevent both parties from hearing unclear. The amplifier stations that have been installed include Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Yinjiahui, Jiujiang, and Tongshan, a total of six locations. Those that are being installed and will be installed include Nanchang, Zheng County, Ba County, Xi'an, Changsha, Yuanling, and Jiangshan, a total of eight locations. From this, it can be seen that all the equipment of the long-distance telephone run by the Ministry is technically superior to others.

The capital to Shanghai long-distance telephone line originally had three pairs of copper wires and one pair of phantom wires for direct communication between Beijing and Shanghai and between the regions between Beijing and Shanghai. There is another pair of telephone lines between Changzhou and Shanghai for mutual communication between Shanghai and Changzhou and the intermediate areas. However, all commercial and personnel matters in Beijing and Shanghai and along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, such as Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou, are known to be important. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the public has felt an urgent need for long-distance telephone service between Beijing and Shanghai and the above-mentioned places. The original long-distance telephone lines are really insufficient for application. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications is now planning to add long-distance telephone lines between Beijing and Shanghai. Carrier waves have been added to the lines between Suzhou and Shanghai to increase the convenience of communication. It can be seen that the Ministry of Communications has been generally expanding the construction of long-distance telephone lines between the provinces and between Beijing and Shanghai recently.

### What the Telecommunications Industry Hopes for from the Third Plenary Session

— Zhen

The Third Plenary Session, which the people of the whole country are looking forward to, opened yesterday. At a time when foreign aggression is becoming more urgent and domestic troubles are recurring, the central committee members of our party have gathered in the capital, bringing together the wise men in one hall, resolving national affairs in public discussion, reviewing past achievements, and formulating future political programs, which will surely satisfy our hopes.

We, in society, are a part of the citizens, and in our profession, we are employees of state-owned enterprises. Our hope for the Third Plenary Session is the development of the telecommunications industry, in addition to the same hopes as the general public. What is the individual hope? It is the development of the telecommunications industry.

The telecommunications industry is a state-owned enterprise, and to seek development, domestic political stability and economic development are necessary. If the political situation is unstable, engineering construction cannot proceed. If the economy is not developed, the business of telegrams and telephones cannot be promoted. If there is no way to proceed and no way to promote, it is difficult to even maintain the status quo.

How can the political situation be stabilized? How can the economy be developed? There is one prerequisite: domestic peace and unity are essential. Only peace can consolidate unity, and only unity can achieve true peace. If peace does not aim at unity, then peace is only a temporary respite. If unity does not use peace as a means, then unity is only a temporary suppression. Peace and unity, unity and peace, act on each other and are mutually cause and effect. When Sun Yat-sen was dying, he instructed the people of the country to "peace," "unity," and "save China," believing that without "peace" and "unity," China could not be "saved."

The telecommunications industry is the national nervous system, and its need for peace and unity is more urgent than that of the general public. Without peace and unity, the circuit will be blocked, the bureau will be controlled, and telegrams and telephones cannot be communicated. Looking at the Xi'an Incident, the time when telecommunications and transportation were restored was the time when the incident was quelled. Even before it was resolved, the people of the country needed each other's news very much, but at that time, telegrams and telephones were subject to artificial destruction and could not be communicated. Even if they were communicated, they were subject to illegal inspections and unwarranted delays, which greatly affected communication efficiency! The loss of business and credit is needless to say. Therefore, the telecommunications industry can only develop in an atmosphere of peace and under a unified situation, which is clear evidence.

Moreover, telecommunications has both a national and an international nature. Its engineering plans, business facilities, personnel management, and financial distribution must be under the unified guidance of the central government, with the general public as the target, and then it can consider priorities, weigh the importance, implement step by step, assign tasks on time, and complete the national communication network. If it is not unified, then the central telecommunications administration will not reach the provinces, or the telecommunications and transportation of this province will not reach the neighboring provinces, or the provinces will duplicate construction and conflict with the central government's laws and compete with the central government's affiliated institutions for temporary benefits, so as to reduce the strength of the entire country, which is not the phenomenon that a modern country should have.

The above is the minimum need of the people of the whole country, and it is also the most urgent hope of the telecommunications industry. We know that the gentlemen of the Third Plenary Session will surely comfort our hopes.

### Prospects for the Expansion of the Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications

— Xu Weili

The Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications has recently located a Jing'an Building to build a new radio station with a power of 2,000 watts. The range of the station can reach all of China and neighboring countries in East Asia. It is heard that it is being actively arranged and will be broadcasting soon. The writer hopes that it can devote more efforts to communicating Chinese and Western cultures and reporting general political, economic, women's, children's, youth, and current affairs knowledge, family, and social common sense, as well as broadcasting music, art, dramas, entertainment, and other programs to promote the function of wireless broadcasting education.

During the reorganization of the station, the current programs are naturally not rich enough to satisfy the audience, but it is not difficult to achieve the effect of assisting social evolution if it can strive to innovate. The following is a list of the recent educational programs of the station:

Note: Other singing, Peking opera, business conditions, news, music, etc. are not included. The detailed information can be found in the station's bi-weekly publication, which is sent with a two-cent postage paid to the station.

Many of the above-listed items are broadcast by experts. It is heard that the professors of Great China University are very enthusiastic about promoting wireless broadcasting education and plan to complete an "Air University." For this great task, the writer hopes that the general public who are enthusiastic about electrical education will cooperate with the Ministry of Communications Radio Station with their valuable time and energy to complete it in the shortest possible time.

As for the national wireless radio listeners, it is hoped that they will cooperate closely with the Ministry of Communications Radio Station. What are the ways to cooperate? The writer will try to give the following two examples:

First: All stores equipped with radios can pay more attention to listening to the station's national goods lectures, business conditions, and news, and record them at any time. Use a wooden board to copy a copy of the record and paste it, and then add the store's own advertising terminology, which is tantamount to making a very ingenious living billboard, hung at the door, which will surely attract customers' attention, gather and watch, thereby arousing the buying psychology. The station also has programs such as teaching Mandarin, English, and party ideology, which can assist the shop assistants and apprentices in self-study, increase their knowledge, and seek the development of business.

Second: All families equipped with radios can listen to the station's programs to assist family education. The station has women's education, children's education, popular lectures, family affairs common sense, pictorial readings, travel stories, etc., so that the whole family, big and small, can get extremely useful knowledge. At the same time, the children in the family should be ordered to record the station's broadcasts with a pen and then repeat them to the family, one is to practice writing, and the other is to practice eloquence. Not only can it increase your children's knowledge, but also increase a lot of fun between the family.

If handled in this way, a wireless radio is not only an entertainment product, but a store's billboard, a seed of happiness in the family—a living tool of mass education!

Finally, the writer hopes that the Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications can always move forward to the "Wireless Broadcasting Education" - the avenue! At the same time, I hope that the national wireless radio listeners will pay attention to listening to the station's broadcasts and add criticism and opinions, and send a letter to the station for consideration, so as to promote its success.

As an aside, I would like to report to the readers: The broadcasting studio of the Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications is located at No. 137 Sassoon Building, Nanjing Road, Shanghai. The station has recently published a bi-weekly broadcast, which, in addition to publishing detailed programs, also has scientific common sense, academic lectures, music, drama, women, children, and other introductions. Readers are welcome to ask for a copy. The postage is two cents and it will be sent immediately. The annual subscription is 40 cents, half a year is 20 cents, and three months is 10 cents. Domestic postage is not charged.

Spring and Autumn

### Reading

— (Chen Tianci)

Reading can increase the moral heart and is the most important thing for nourishing life.

Reading can value doubt, and doubt can lead to belief.

Reading is gradual, and gradual can lead to success.

Reading is most afraid of complacency. Only emptiness can receive fullness. If there is fullness, there is no room for anything else. Scholars should wear these words.

Reading must know the method of entering and exiting. At the beginning, you should seek the reason for entering, and at the end, you should seek the reason for exiting. Seeing it intimately is the method of entering, and using it thoroughly is the method of exiting.

When scholars read, they must look at each sentence from their own perspective, thinking and understanding on one hand, and reflecting and practicing on the other hand. This is reading.

Reading a book you have not seen is like getting a good friend, and reading a book you have seen is like meeting an old friend.

Even if reading does not make you famous, you will still have noble character. Cultivating virtue does not require reward, and you will naturally have peaceful dreams and peace of mind.

Many families have been ruined in ancient and modern times, all because of accumulating virtue. The first character in the world is still reading.

### Wang Xiaolai Compares Himself to Livestock

— Sun Chucheng

Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, is a busy man in Shanghai. He has his name in almost every committee of the group. Almost all day long, every moment, he is living in a group life. So he has a slogan, called doing cattle and horses during the day and cats and dogs at night. Those who do not know think that a good big man, why compare himself to animals? Even if he wants to compare himself to animals, he should think from the aspects of dragons, phoenixes, tigers, and pengs, which show his greatness of identity and his lofty aspirations. Why should he compare himself to cattle, horses, cats, and dogs who are despised by people? I used to think it was strange, so I asked him. After his explanation, I realized that it was meaningful. He said that cattle and horses are animals that work hard and bear grudges, are whipped by people, and do things for people. Since he is the chairman and member of various groups, he should do things for people and seek the welfare of the public. He should be as willing as cattle and horses to take on important responsibilities and work faithfully for the owner. However, people's energy is not as strong as that of cattle and horses. After being busy all day, they should think of a way to entertain themselves to regulate their body and mind. Therefore, he likes to sing Peking opera and plays black-headed roles, and he also loves to climb volcanoes and hug people. People think that singing and dancing are a waste of money and useless to people. They don't know that whether it is cold or hot during the day, it is inevitable to catch a cold when going out to do things, and due to time constraints, you have to take a car instead of walking, so there is no chance to exercise. Now, singing expands the voice, and you have to sing according to the board. As a result, you are covered in sweat, which is like taking a dose of medicine to release the surface, which can remove the wind and cold. Dancing keeps the feet moving, and you have to move forward and backward, left and right. The result is a whole-body exercise, which can regulate blood vessels. Cats like to jump, and dogs like to bark. The reason why I compare myself to cats and dogs is to describe the barking of singing and the jumping of dancing. If you think that cats and dogs are inferior animals, your concept is also wrong. Cats can catch mice, and dogs can guard the night. They all protect the owner from violence and good, do their duty, and are kept by the owner without feeling guilty. Compared with those who wear tiger charms and drag big ribbons, who do not know how to suppress bandits when they see them, and retreat when they meet enemies, causing the loss of land and soldiers and causing endless worries to the country, they are still one level higher. How can you despise them just because they are domestic animals? Although the language is humorous, it has a deep meaning, so I especially highlight it to fill this publication.

### A Gain from the Beauty of Words

— Bili

I love to read the small orders between flowers; especially the beauty of Fei Qing and the fluency of Duan Yi. Every time I read a poem, I always peel it apart and carefully sacrifice it. Its taste is like chewing olives, like tasting clear springs. Now, I will try to explain one of Fei Qing's Bodhisattva Man:

"Emerald Quills, Golden Threads, Double Mandarin Ducks, Water Patterns, Fine Rises, Spring Pool, Emerald Green, Pond on the Sea, Crabapple Pear, Rain Sunny, Red Full Branches. Embroidered Shirt Covers Smiling Dimples, Tobacco Grass Sticks Flying Butterflies, Green Lock Against Fragrant Flowers, Jade Pass Sound Information Rare."

The two words mandarin ducks describe the shape of the emerald quill, so the first sentence is to write makeup. The second sentence leads from the fake water bird to a pool of spring water. With just these two sentences, a picture of a beauty by the water, full of charm, is already vividly on the scene. The next two sentences, as everyone knows, are to write about the brilliance of the spring scenery on the pond.

The two sentences after the crossover are actually the most brilliant part of the whole article. Yu Pingbo's occasional reading of the words only said: "These two sentences are also to write about the beauty of spring tour," which is too superficial for Fei Qing's famous sentence. The word "laugh" in the first sentence and the word "stick" in the second sentence are the key to the brilliance and cannot be ignored. The general meaning of this word is that a girl is disturbed by the spring scenery and is stirred up by the spring hate. Then what can she "laugh" about when she walks alone in the garden? The word "stick" in the next sentence is too ordinary if it is only used as a butterfly, squatting on the tobacco grass. It must be known that the word "stick" is the "stick" of a pair of butterflies sticking together. With such an explanation, the "laugh" word in the previous article has a root. You think of a girl who is appreciating the beautiful spring flowers, suddenly saw this pair of butterflies sticking together, how can she not blush and smile involuntarily? After all, she is a girl, seeing this scene, it is always a little embarrassing, so she has to raise her "embroidered shirt" to "cover her smiling dimples." Reading it in this way, you know that Fei Qing's words are beautiful and lovely. If you ask a painting master to paint, you will definitely not be able to describe this look. Photography, how can you find the opportunity between a killer? And Fei Qing's implicit two sentences convey the feeling and scenery, which is both delicate and neat, and is indeed a saintly hand in the words.

With this provocation of spring, it is even more obvious that the spring hate has a cause. Insects are like this, but people do not have any news; how can they not stir up a full of melancholy complaints? Ask Mr. Yu Pingbo, do you also think my words are true?

### Heart Sounds of Heaven

— Pillow Green

Today's people create vernacular poems, saying that it is "living literature," which is relatively discarding old-style poems, regarding them as dead literature. I don't know that the ancients' concept of poetry also emphasized vernacular and took the popular; people said: "Bai Xiangshan's poems, even old women can understand," which is clear evidence. There are also old-style words, composed of long and short sentences, which are already wonderful for talking and entering the silk. A flash of inspiration can write full of feelings on paper and exude a day of charm. Just give an example; it is said that there was a prostitute in Sichuan who blamed a regular customer for coming less often. This customer gave words to explain himself, and the prostitute replied in rhyme: "Say the alliance, say the oath, say the love, say the meaning, it is full of spring sorrow on paper. It should be read "Tuokong Sutra," which gentleman taught it? ... No tea, no rice, no words, no words, only to be haggard for him. Acacia is not free, and there is no time to curse you?" For example, this song, there is not a single classical Chinese sentence in the whole song, and the three words "Tuokong Sutra" are purely slang, and the meaning is the same as the two words "Wok (read Ping Sheng) Kong" in Su Bai. I say this because I want to ask the gentlemen who advocate vernacular poems not to ignore these ready-made, rhymed and popular works.

### Changing the Nest for the Phoenix

— Authored by Zhang Henshui

Chapter Eleven (Whispered Words Move the Merciful Mother, Confessions of Love and Filial Piety, Autumn Light Dimming the Emerald Brows, Scenery Evokes Thoughts)

Only after the sound of footsteps on the stairs faded away, knowing that the Second Young Mistress had arrived, did she greet her with a smile at the door, saying: "Second Sister-in-law, you are so thoughtful, how did you think of sending me a few pots of chrysanthemums?" The Second Young Mistress took her hand and said with a smile: "I saw you were always frowning, and wanted to go out and play with you, but you didn't like anything. Later, I thought that my family likes to grow chrysanthemums, and you always praised them, so I told the old nanny to go back and pick a few good flowers to send over. Do you like them?" Menglan smiled and said: "They are wonderful. Not only do the flowers have character, but the pots they are planted in are also extremely elegant. Who in your household knows how to grow chrysanthemums?" The Second Young Mistress said: "My father knows how to grow chrysanthemums. Even my two elder brothers and I have all learned a little." Upon hearing this, Menglan couldn't help but sigh. The Second Young Mistress held her hand, looked at her face, and was somewhat taken aback. After a long time, she said, "You seem to have learned..." Menglan smiled and said: "Don't misunderstand, I'm not blaming you for sending the flowers poorly. I just feel that now that I'm a young lady, I don't have the leisure and elegance you had when you were a young lady." The Second Young Mistress led her to sit on the bed, patted her shoulder, and said with a smile: "Don't complain like that. How can we compare to you? When I was a young lady, I was confined to my room, that was my duty. Now you are the most fashionable female student, and you are free to go wherever you want. How can we compare?" As for... The Second Young Mistress also felt that continuing this line of conversation was not quite right, so she leaned over the table, gazing intently at the chrysanthemum resembling a lazy woman dressing her hair. She smiled and said: "Sister, what do you think of how this bonsai is planted? According to your Second Brother, the Japanese make the best bonsai, even better than the bonsai made by the people of Suzhou." Menglan smiled and said: "You are a scholar who never leaves his house, yet knows everything under heaven. I don't even know about Japanese bonsai." Seeing that there was already a happy expression on her face, the Second Young Mistress moved the armchair by the desk and sat down facing Menglan. They began to chat casually, intentionally or unintentionally. The little chrysanthemum seemed to have been instructed by the Second Young Mistress. It immediately brewed a pot of tea, poured it into teacups, and distributed them to the two sisters-in-law. Menglan held the teacup, seeing that most of the cup was filled with tea that was a shade of green, with swirls of tea steam rising from the surface, carrying a faint fragrance to her nose. She stared at the cup for a long time, smiled, and said: "This is the Cloud Mist Tea from Mother's room, not something that can be taken out casually?" The Second Young Mistress held her teacup and looked at it for a while, nodding with a smile and saying: "That's right, this is the teacup from Mother's room. Perhaps Mother thought that we were here admiring chrysanthemums and should have sent some wine for us to drink. But thinking that neither of us would drink, she sent good tea instead of wine."

Special Feature

### Water Courtyards on the Songhua River

— Wujiang

Every year when the cold winter arrives, after several heavy snowfalls, the lively Songhua River freezes into a thick layer of ice. Then people engage in various activities on the vast river surface. For example, along the river in Jilin City, firewood vendors build many water courtyards of various sizes to trade firewood.

The construction of water courtyards is not a difficult project: first, the layers of accumulated snow on the river surface are cleared away one by one to determine the shape and size of the courtyard. Then, small ditches are dug around the perimeter. However, the ice is as hard as iron and stone, making it difficult to dig open. Once the small ditches are dug, wooden boards or small branches are inserted into the ditches. As they are inserted, they are watered with icy water. Soon, the wooden boards are frozen as firmly as if they were nailed in place. Inside the large courtyard, other than some fodder for livestock piled in the corners and a few troughs for feeding livestock, the entire space is used for storing firewood.

After the market opens, every morning, rows of carts loaded with firewood are dragged from various towns and villages on the roads from the east, west, north, and south. Some are pulled by livestock, others by people. They all gather in the various courtyards to await customers' demands.

During this freezing cold weather, farmers stop all field activities. They then drag the firewood they have chopped with axes and knives to the city to sell. Some of them live hundreds of miles away and have to brave the cold and walk through the white snowy ground in the middle of the night, hoping to arrive early and sell their goods quickly so that they can return home that day. Most people in the city who buy firewood go to the water courtyards early in the morning. At this time, firewood prices are relatively cheap, and some plan to buy enough for a year or half a year. Because once the spring breeze warms up, the river thaws, making transportation difficult. Moreover, farmers are busy with farming and have no time to go to the city to sell firewood. Therefore, winter is the peak season for selling firewood.

Originally, the Northeast is rich in coal, and most people can use coal. However, heated brick beds (kangs) are still mostly heated with firewood. In the cold winter, the kangs in every household are heated very warmly. Whether old or young, they spend the whole day working or playing on the kang, so firewood is more needed than coal.

Every morning, the cold and desolate Songhua River is filled with the sounds of people talking, the cries of cattle and horses, and the sounds of footsteps on the ice and snow, all interwoven to create a warm and bustling atmosphere. However, since the "September 18th Incident" (Mukden Incident), farmers from distant villages have been prohibited from dragging firewood on the road at night, and some have even been killed. As a result, the firewood market on the river has become bleak!

Short Story

### New Year's Money

— Xiafei

In my hometown, as soon as December 15th had passed, the family would become busy. Sweeping the house, slaughtering pigs, making rice cakes—preparing to celebrate the annual New Year festival with bustling activity. At that time, in the hearts of us children, one day felt longer than a month, and we eagerly hoped that the annoying old year would pass quickly, and that the joyous New Year would arrive soon.

One year, also on New Year's Eve, my grandmother held a plate in her hands, walked up to me with a smile, and said to me:

"Afei, this is your New Year's money: you will be a year older tomorrow, and you should grow a little more knowledge..." Before my grandmother finished speaking, I took the plate from her. When I looked, in addition to a heavy red paper packet, there were two New Year's cakes, two oranges, and many water caltrop peanuts; so, I happily hid them next to my pillow on my bed.

The New Year passed quickly, our days of revelry were coming to an end, and everything would naturally return to the way it was before. —

But one day, perhaps on the evening of the Lantern Festival, the family was holding a ceremony to welcome the Kitchen God, while my grandmother was sitting alone in the living room chanting Buddhist scriptures. At that time, I was playing with toys next to her.

"How much New Year's money did you get this year, Afei!" She suddenly stopped chanting and turned her head to ask me. But I didn't tell her exactly how much I had gotten, but just replied, "A lot!"

"What about the one I gave you?" She asked softly again.

"Under the pillow!" I said, looking at her face. I only saw a kind and comforting smile on her face.

"Remember, you have to hide these two dollars carefully, because I saved them up after spinning cotton thread for a whole year to give to you." She patted my shoulder and turned her face back to continue chanting her scriptures; the prayer beads in her hand were spinning around her fingertips like a belt on an engine.

My grandmother loved me the most, because my father only had four children, and at this time, my eldest sister had already gotten married, my second elder brother had died at the age of six, and my younger brother was still in swaddling clothes, and he was traveling outside with my mother; so, only one child remained at home. But at this time, our family situation was very difficult; my father worked as an employee outside, and the money he earned was not enough for the family's expenses, so sometimes my mother also had to go outside to supplement the household expenses with what she earned with her own hands; at the same time, my grandmother also had to make a living herself in order to reduce my father's burden.

At that time, she was already over seventy years old, but she still helped take care of a temple in Baoshan. Of course, there was no salary, but she was given something to eat. However, in her spare time, she still spun cotton thread, slowly accumulating the money left over from her fingertips, and giving it to me as New Year's money on New Year's Eve. — My grandmother usually lived in the temple, but she returned home once every year on the Little New Year's Eve and went back after the first half of the first month. Tomorrow was the day she would return to the temple, so she was telling me these things today.

But unfortunately, in November of that year—only a little over a month away from New Year's Eve—my grandmother was suddenly carried back on a plank door, and her illness was already very serious. So, after barely surviving for more than a week, she finally passed away despite medical treatment.

After that, I hid these two New Year's dollars, and wrapped them in the original red paper packet. My mother also told me: "Even if you are starving, don't spend these two dollars!" Now, the original red paper has faded to white.

These are two silver dollars, and they are of the same type. Every New Year's Eve, I always take them out and put them next to my pillow, and in my dreams, I seem to see my grandmother's kind and gentle smile, and:

"Afei, this is your New Year's money, you will be a year older tomorrow, and you should grow a little more knowledge..." But when I reached out to take the plate, there was nothing there. Opening my eyes, I found my body still lying in the attic in a foreign land, and the first ray of sunlight of the new year had already crept in through the dilapidated window.

Commentary

### Leading by Example

— Xiao Mei

The marriage system of "parents' orders and matchmaker's words" will probably no longer be supported by anyone except for stubborn and inflexible pedants. Whether it is the so-called new youth or the earlier generations who are ridiculed as "big feet," they have now come to respect their children's opinions on their "lifelong affairs" and allow their children to decide for themselves.

This result did not come out of thin air. From the May Fourth Movement to the present, in addition to verbal attacks and written criticisms, there have been actions as a more resolute response. In these many years, pure young people have staged many tragedies of elopement in order to fight for their lifelong happiness, only to achieve such meager results.

Generally, what is obtained at the cost of a lot of sacrifice is considered more valuable. Therefore, before the old forces are completely destroyed, "leading by example" and using facts to respond is also very important. Of course, the so-called "leading by example" includes a correct understanding of the meaning. If the understanding is insufficient or the method is inappropriate, it will not only fail to help new construction but will also help the hidden growth of new forces.

According to reports: Tai Shuangqiu, the dean of the Education College of Great China University, recently got engaged. Mr. Tai is extremely filial to his mother. For his "lifelong affairs," he relies entirely on his mother to decide. "Anyone who is introduced to him must be introduced to his mother. If his mother is not satisfied, regardless of her character or learning, Mr. Tai will refuse her. If his mother considers her satisfactory, Mr. Tai will obey and accept her." Under such a decision, Mr. Tai recently obtained a wife who is "physically strong and has a dignified attitude."

"Being very filial to one's mother" is a virtue, and marriage is a personal matter, so it seems unnecessary for outsiders to interfere. Moreover, all parents in the world love their children, so there is no reason why they would not care about or act cautiously in their children's lifelong affairs. However, because Mr. Tai is engaged in social education, his past service to society has created his current reputation, and his every move is enough to move social opinion. So, although it looks like a personal matter, I still want to say a few words about my personal feelings.

As mentioned above, "being very filial to one's mother" is a virtue, and "a virtuous mother produces a filial son" is generally mutually causative. Tai's mother's choice of a virtuous daughter-in-law will naturally be more cautious than other mothers, which is certain. However, we would like to raise a question here, which is: Because of the times, is the virtuous daughter-in-law chosen by a loving mother necessarily the good wife of a filial son? The progress of the times often leads to the rejection of things that were considered right in the previous era. We do not have to doubt Tai's mother's standards for choosing a daughter-in-law now; Mr. Tai's new wife is certainly Mr. Tai's best "comrade," and we can offer our blessings. But is such a method of almost risking one's lifelong happiness, even if it is "very satisfactory" to Mr. Tai, the best method for general young people? This is something that deserves our deep consideration.

"...Since Shuangqiu is one of the founders of this method, he must lead by example and advocate for society... Shuangqiu wrongly bears the responsibility of promoting the movement of reading two, and every move is his own responsibility to transform society. He deeply does not want those who improve society to turn into a social curse..."

Precisely because Mr. Tai "takes it upon himself to transform society with every move," we cannot help but have doubts about such "leading by example," and we cannot help but think of "those who improve society turning into a social curse."

### Five Years

— Zhi Lei

The firecrackers outside are ringing continuously, as if deliberately telling the wandering people:

"It's the New Year!"

People who are used to a wandering life simply don't know what a year or a festival is. At most, they buy two bottles of "Huadiao wine" and get drunk when they are happy, and that's only if they have money. But this reminds me of New Year's Eve five years ago, which was when our Harbin fell, or rather, was sold out by traitors.

Originally, around the 27th or 28th of the lunar December, our troops were fighting the enemy at Caijiagou. Unfortunately, we retreated several hundred miles after one battle. On the 29th, we retreated the first line of defense to the rear of Shuangchengbao, almost to the outside of our power plant.

Because of the spread of this news, and also constantly hearing the sound of guns and cannons, there were hardly any people in the dining room at dinner that night. It seemed that the sound of cannons had filled their bellies. Returning to the dormitory, I saw colleagues gathered in groups of twos and threes, talking and discussing, with a look of panic on everyone's face. A tense atmosphere enveloped the entire power plant.

"Hey, do you hear the machine gun firing?" I don't know which colleague was speaking.

"Let's go, let's go up to the cooling tower to take a look!" Another voice suggested.

When we arrived at the cooling tower, there were already several workers from the power plant and the machine repair shop standing there. When they saw us coming, they quickly pointed us in the direction. A worker from the machine repair shop pointed to the left and said

"Look over here."

I looked in the direction he pointed, and saw a large fireball rolling up from the ground level, followed by a loud "boom." The worker said to me again:

"This cannon is very far from here, about Guxiangtun."

The next day, the atmosphere was relaxed, not as tense as last night. The sound of gunfire could not be heard, only planes flying and circling in the sky. We looked up in the courtyard and saw two red dots on the wings. At this moment, its "buzzing" sound became louder, and its body also lowered. The old section chief shouted loudly:

"Scatter quickly!"

When people heard this, they all scattered. After the section chief watched the plane leave, he said to everyone:

"That was close! Didn't you see it spinning? It was preparing to drop a bomb! If I hadn't told you to scatter, it might have dropped one."

On the street, those ×× children and women were raising flags in front of their doors, chanting slogans. The Jihong Bridge was crowded with fair-haired, blue-eyed girls and middle-aged women, as well as some men with high noses, also raising a small ×× flag. At a glance, it was clear that those desperate White Russians were preparing to welcome their enemies from more than thirty years ago.

In the evening, I secretly went out to the street to inquire about news. The dim streetlights seemed to be crying as they illuminated the wide road. I walked along the silent street with the terror of entering a wolf pack. I hated that my legs were walking too slowly. I didn't know how to make my legs walk faster. The sound of the enemy cavalry's horseshoes hitting the stone road was like knives piercing my heart, causing me intense pain and terror. After walking a few more steps, a corpse lay across the road ahead. This made my heart beat even faster, almost bursting. My legs were weak, and I was about to squat down.

A large pool of blood flowed beside the corpse, facing the ground, with snow and mud all over the back of his head. He looked like a student in his twenties. Suddenly, a cold shiver seemed to give me strength from the dead body, my legs became lighter, and I quickly left the scene of the dead person.

I quickly walked to a cross street. There was no one on this street, and the streetlights on both sides had lost their light. However, the sound of horses' hooves became clearer. "Walk quickly, walk quickly," my heart was always urging my legs like this. I forgot how I walked back to the dormitory afterwards. People spent New Year's Eve in this last panic. But now it has been five years!

### Mountain Lodge

— Lu Ping

I love lodges, especially small lodges built on mountains. Because lodges are different from flat houses, they are not only dry and spacious, with good airflow and ample light, but also have endless charm. If this lodge is built on a mountain, then the beauty and tranquility of the scenery go without saying.

However, lodges and windows are very related. Where there is a lodge, there must be windows. It can be said that windows are like the eyes of a person. Therefore, for the windows on a lodge, an appropriate design is required for the location, style, direction, etc.; otherwise, they may destroy the benefits of the lodge.

Seven or eight years ago, I built a small lodge in my hometown. Precisely because it was a small lodge, I loved it very much. This lodge was located exactly halfway up a high mountain ridge, backed by green mountains and facing Tai Lake. The scenery was beautiful and the environment was quiet. Living inside, it was as if I had stepped into a painting, with a feeling of being detached from the world!

At that time, I read books and wrote articles in this lodge. Until I was forced by life to leave my hometown, I reluctantly said goodbye to the mountain lodge. Now, it has been more than ten years since we parted, although the mountain lodge is still safe.

### Beautiful Female Movie Star

— Tan

Because female movie stars often put on powder and makeup when filming, their skin is prone to dryness, aging, roughness, and wrinkles, and their faces are prone to spots, pimples, and blisters.

But why are some female movie stars so beautiful? After my investigation, I learned that they often use "Yipinxiang" skin cream to protect their faces. "Yipinxiang" is rich in medicinal effects (produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy) and can penetrate deep into the skin, promote metabolic function, and normalize secretion, not only whitening the skin but also eliminating spots, pimples, roughness, and wrinkles. Apply it to the face after washing your face or before going to bed to maintain lasting beauty.

Therefore, the "top" female movie stars like to use "Yipinxiang" skin care products.

### Twins

— Chain Link

Guo Defu was a man of forty-five years, and he still had no son under his knees.

His wife also eagerly hoped for the birth of a son to alleviate the loneliness in their lives. However, after waiting for a long time without any offspring, she was often depressed and unhappy about this matter.

Suddenly one day, Guo's relatives and friends received the good news from Mr. Guo. It turned out that Mr. Guo not only had a son, but also twins. Thus, relatives and friends were all happy for him.

On the day of the baby's first month celebration, Mr. Guo happily accepted the congratulations from the guests. During the banquet, he reported, "My wife's body was originally weak, so there was no hope of having children. However, since taking the 'Women's Treasure' from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, her blood has been vigorous, her body healthy, and her spirit lively. She was even able to produce twin boys in one birth. Now, I would like to ask everyone to have two more cups of celebratory wine."

, but the person is gone and the building is empty. I don't know when I will be able to return to that mountain house to read and write.

I remember that my room was a small room facing south, with a row of bright glass windows on three sides. Facing south, I could see a vast expanse of white Tai Lake, the water and sky connected in the distance, like a piece of white satin. On sunny days, it was dotted with lonely sails and faint island shadows. The flocks of birds flying under the white clouds and the sunlight shimmering on the waves would truly intoxicate my soul. When it rained, the misty rain and heavy fog shrouded the lake, and all the scenery of the lake and mountains was reduced to a blurred outline. I would watch the sunrise in the morning and the sunset in the evening. Especially on moonlit nights with sparse stars, I would often lean against the window to enjoy the scenery under the moon.

The building was surrounded by a plum grove. Whenever the plum blossoms were in full bloom, I could see a pure white scene simply by looking down from the window. When I lowered my head to read or write at my desk, a faint fragrance would drift in from the window, filling the small room with an ethereal freshness.

To the north were continuous, undulating mountain peaks. In the autumn, I would always see some woodcutters or firewood gatherers climbing along the winding mountain paths through the yellow leaves and withered grass. The faint songs would be carried into my ears from the open window. In the winter, if there was fresh snow, the mountain ridges would all turn into a crouching jade dragon. To the east, there was a boundless expanse of fields and farmhouses, trees, wheat fields, and vegetable patches. As long as I was happy to stand in front of this window, I could take in all the colorful scenery. The inexhaustible scenery all belonged to this mountain house.

In front of the window, I specially planted a camellia and a sweet dew shrub. The growth and propagation of the sweet dew was truly surprisingly rapid. I planted it in early spring, and by the summer of the same year, it had grown as tall as the eaves. By the second year, it had grown from one or two to five, almost completely obscuring the south-facing window. The lush green giant leaves swayed in front of the window, making them extremely endearing. In the morning, I often went to collect the dew accumulated on the leaves and put it in my inkstone. At night, I would listen to the sound of the wind blowing through the leaves or the sound of rain hitting the banana leaves, lost in thought. At noon, I would sometimes pick a leaf to use as a mat to sleep on. However, the camellia tree that was planted at the same time is still not as tall as me.

There were also a few slender bamboos beside the house, which are now said to have become a grove. In the past, a pair of swallows had built a nest on my small building. The swallows came in the spring to build a new house and live together, had children, and then left in the autumn. The second year, the third year, they still came and went the same way. So for half the year, the swallows accompanied me, and for the other half of the time, I was just reading and writing in the mountain house in solitude. But I love quiet, so I don't dislike that lonely solitude.

"Now, the mountain house is unharmed. I wonder if the swallows still return every year?" I silently miss it.

### Coconut Grove

— Nan Ou

Whenever I feel lonely, I miss that distant southern island, because that's where my home is, and my grandfather's abandoned coconut grove. Now, I've grown up, and my childhood memories have gradually faded away, some even disappearing completely! However, I still clearly remember that under the blue sky, not far from the town, there was the small, quiet coconut grove. It was surrounded by a bamboo fence. On that fertile land, my grandfather diligently planted dozens of coconut trees. Day after day, month after month, year after year, the coconut trees grew, their trunks towering high, their green leaves swaying in the wind. Then they began to bear coconuts, one after another, so big and so round. My grandfather's wrinkled face smiled as he praised the fruit of his hard work to the people. Then, one by one, the coconuts were picked and taken to the market in ox carts, where they were exchanged for shiny Dutch dollars (currency name). Then he wanted to find a beautiful wife for his son, and worked twice as hard in the hope of having a child. Then came the day when the whole family was excited, especially my grandfather, whose hope was about to be realized. He was almost like a child, his face flushed, pacing back and forth outside the wife's door, restless, until I was born with a cry...

I grew up under the love and teachings of my grandfather and mother. One day, I was taken out of the house, sat on an ox cart, and went to the coconut grove. Pointing to the fence, the green grass, and the coconut trees towering in the sky, my grandfather stroked his snow-white beard and said to me:

"Look, how big these coconuts are, how fertile the land in the grove is! Child, these will all be yours in the future. Would you like to have a sip of coconut water? Good, ask someone to pick a few."

Yes, how fresh and sweet the coconut water was. After opening the hard shell, my grandfather and I each shared half to drink. Then, we dug out the coconut meat to eat. While eating, my grandfather also told me about how to make coconut cakes, coconut oil, and dried coconuts, and asked me if I liked this coconut grove? How could I not like it? Later, when I was older, I often ran here alone. The old man who looked after the grove was also a kind and gentle person, calling me little master while cutting away the weeds on the ground. The sun was very hot, and the old man's back was covered in sweat. Seeing him working so hard, I helped him. When it was time to pick coconuts, even my mother was happy to come to the grove to bring tea to the workers. My grandfather was too old, so he sat under the thatched hut, smoking a cigar, and asked me to accompany him. However, this year, the tide of the world's economic depression swept to the coast of the southern island. The harvest of coconuts was more than in previous years, but the price dropped so much that no one dared to believe it! Because of this, my grandfather was worried about the coconut grove: "If this continues, what will become of us!" he said softly. When it came time to pick coconuts the following year, my grandfather quietly passed away underground.

Without my grandfather, I'm afraid I was the only one who loved that coconut grove! My father was pursuing his own career and rarely even set foot in the coconut grove. But I was young and lacked the ability to manage it. In fact, coconuts became less and less valuable every day. The old man also received a sum of money from my father and returned to his home country. Watching the coconut grove that my grandfather had opened up with his own hands gradually fall into disrepair, I was almost crying: but what was the use? My father's idea was that if someone wanted the bitter fruit, it would be better to sell it. Until now, because the whole world is in an economic panic, it is impossible for people to maintain the status quo, who would buy my small coconut grove?

Abandoned coconut grove, whenever I feel lonely, I miss it, searching for traces of longing from my memory. Counting the days, I have been away from the southern island for four years. The weeds in the coconut grove, and the weeds on my grandfather's grave, must no longer remember me, the little master drifting on the sea, right?

### Minxin News

"Gate of Flesh and Soul" requires a musical score, and the work is nearing completion. The sound copies will be distributed to various locations within two weeks.

Jin Qingyu's new work "Fighting at the Wall" script has been submitted to the Central Review Board. The story is more tortuous and moving than "Motherly Love", and the cast also appears with a new look.

The trailer for "Gate of Flesh and Soul" is particularly novel and has been completed. It will be handed over to theaters for screening soon.

The location shooting for "New Humanity" has been unusually intense recently. It is expected to be completed within the budget period. Whether the new Minxin film will be shot after "New Humanity" is completed, or whether it will be shot first, has not yet been decided.

The entire plot of "Mysterious Female Detective" is as tense as possible. Regarding the ideological aspect, it also strives for correctness. It is truly a new type of hard-hitting film.

In "Gate of Flesh and Soul", the main characters have something to do from beginning to end, without missing a step. Moreover, with the transcendence of handling and performance, it can also make the audience's mind not relax a step. This is truly one of the characteristics of this film.

Li Keng, Li Xi, and their newborn younger sister, the three siblings all perform in "New Humanity", playing Zhao Minjie's young son in three different eras.

Bu Wancang said: "When the silent 'Humanity' was filmed four or five years ago, the urban part was filmed first, followed by the rural part. This time, 'New Humanity' coincides again, and the filming process is the same as 'Humanity'." Therefore, luxury and extravagance and famine and hunger form a contrasting force on the set.

### A Scene from Tianyi's New Film "Wealth and Glory"

### Cathay Screens "Hot-Blooded Lovers"

Is the "Party Soul" on the talking silver screen

"Hot-Blooded Lovers" Stjenka Rasin (Volffa-Volga) is a tragic and passionate historical love film set in the era of imperial Russia. The male lead Hans Schlettow from "Party Soul" plays the lead role, and the beautiful female star Vera Angers plays the supporting role. The film tells of the military warlords in power at the time, and the people living in misery. The exciting parts are exciting, and the poignant parts are tearful. The "Boatman's Song", which once sensationalized Shanghai, has an even stronger performance in this film. The mountain battle and sea battle scenes are also tense, real, and soul-stirring. The Cathay Grand Theater will specially screen this film starting today (Tuesday), which is indeed a good work worth appreciating during the Spring Festival.

### "Our Children's Theater Company" First Recruitment of Members

Our city's "Our Children's Theater Company" has been preparing since September last year and has received sponsorship from all sectors of society. Therefore, it plans to convene an inaugural meeting soon to realize the desire to "promote the Chinese children's drama movement with the power of the children themselves." The company is starting its first recruitment of members, in order to connect with the children of this city, strengthen the company's power, so that everyone can get proper entertainment, and everyone can have the opportunity to study drama. It is said that the recruitment method is: children under the age of seventeen can participate as official members, and children aged eighteen to twenty can participate as "special members" - special members have no administrative power. The company charter will be sent upon request. The company address is at the New Central Grand Theater at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road in this city. It is also said that in order to welcome new members to join, the company will hold a tea party in the company every Sunday afternoon, with singing and other entertainment, in order to connect the friendship of new and old members.

### "Song at Midnight" Completed

Ma Xuweibang's directed plays have always been known for their meticulousness. Whether it is sound, makeup, lighting, scenery, or even the arrangement of small props, he personally takes care of everything and does everything meticulously. This new work "Song at Midnight", which he worked on at Xinhua, took eight months to complete and cost a lot of money.

The plot of "Song at Midnight" describes a tortuous and touching, sad and beautiful realistic story, full of sad, but active emotions. In terms of performance, Ma Xuweibang used tense and terrifying techniques in order to strengthen the dramatic nature of the story, so that the whole film is immersed in a gloomy and terrifying feeling from beginning to end, making people stare in shock and shiver.
