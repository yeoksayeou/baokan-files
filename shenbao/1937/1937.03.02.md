Therefore, the importance of this plenary session exceeded all previous plenary sessions. He believed that comrades of the party should strive to implement the declaration, and not repeat the mistake of making decisions without acting on them. Furthermore, all important undertakings in various localities and the leadership of society should still be promoted with the party as the center. Some people believe that all local affairs can be handled by the government, and party headquarters are unnecessary. This kind of thinking is very wrong and should be corrected. He hoped that all comrades would intensify their efforts after this Third Plenary Session so that everything is controlled by the party, and then national rejuvenation can be achieved simply by waiting for it. Chairman 居正 concluded his remarks, and the service ended. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 1st)

(Nanjing) The National Government held its memorial week service at 10:00 AM on the 1st. 张继, 邓家彦, 王伯群, 经亨颐, 朴云陔, 陈绍宽, 陈树人, 陈训泳, 陈其采, 吕超, 魏怀, and members of the National Government and various Yuan and ministries, totaling over 400 people, attended. Chairman Lin led the service and then gave a speech on "Local Administration as the Foundation of National Politics." He explained that a country's administration can be divided into two parts: central administration and local administration. To govern a country well, it is necessary to rely on both effective central administration and careful attention to local administration. If local administration can be promoted smoothly, the entire national politics will have a solid foundation. Therefore, to improve the effectiveness of national politics, it is necessary to study local administration as the foundation of national politics. Next, he elaborated on the idea that local administration is the foundation of national politics, saying that many central government orders cannot be directly implemented by themselves and must rely on local governments to promote them to have a practical effect. Therefore, the work of central agencies focuses on decision-making, while local agencies focus on implementation. No matter how complete the policies decided by the central government, they will be useless if the local government cannot earnestly follow them. Moreover, the central government is relatively distant from the people, while the local government is closest to the people. If local politics is well managed, the people and the government will naturally have a good relationship, and thus they will be very concerned about the politics of the country, and they will also generate a strong political interest. This political interest is not only a basic element for the realization of democracy, but also the best magic weapon for unity. From this, it can be seen that local administration is the foundation of national politics, and central administration is its superstructure. If the foundation is solid, the entire national politics can be promoted to the fullest advantage. He further described the central issues that constitute local administration, one being the organization of local government, and the other being the powers of local government. For the former, in addition to mentioning that China, due to the bandit suppression in recent years, has temporarily improved local administrative efficiency by establishing administrative inspectors, setting up district offices, combining provincial government offices, and changing county government bureaus to sections in order to adapt to needs, he also said that how China's local administrative organization should be further improved in the future to enhance local administrative efficiency is still hoped that central and local officials and experts will continue to work hard and improve as much as possible based on practical experience and findings. For the latter, he said that under the system of balanced powers created by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, local governments, except for military, foreign affairs, currency, and other matters that are national in scope, can promote other matters that need to be adapted to local conditions without hindrance within their powers. Therefore, only when the central and local governments do their best and do not interfere with each other can national politics achieve sound development. This is the major principle that must be followed in determining the powers of local governments in the future. Finally, he hoped that everyone would jointly study to promote the rationalization of local administration and establish a strong foundation for the country.

### British Defence Minister Explains Purpose of Military Buildup

Resolved to Protect France and Belgium if Invaded. Japan Building Fastest Submarine

(London) Defence Minister Sir Hoare gave a speech last night, stating that the government would be overthrown if it did not implement a policy of military rearmament. The whole world should understand that there are really no two opinions in Britain about the need for military rearmament, and this is a very important matter. However, we may have different opinions on how to deal with it, and there are also some different opinions on foreign policy. We are now rearming to defend world peace, and we will protect France, Belgium, or Germany when they are attacked. (Special dispatch from the Zi Lin West Daily, 28th)

(London) A detailed report on the construction, design, speed, and tonnage of warships in various countries around the world was released today. According to the report, the Japanese government is currently building the fastest submarine in the world's navy. After the completion of the Japanese "I-72" class and "I-75" class submarines, the surface speed will reach 20 nautical miles per hour. The report also stated that the old British cruisers Coventry and Curlew have been converted into a new type of warship called anti-aircraft ships, equipped with ten 4-inch high-angle guns and eight mine tubes. The British "Tribal" class destroyers each displace 1,850 tons and have engines that reach 44,000 horsepower, an increase of about 10,000 horsepower compared to previous destroyers. Their speed is no more than 36 nautical miles. The ships will be equipped with eight 4.7-inch guns, twice as many as those installed on ordinary destroyers. Germany is currently building six destroyers with the same displacement as the "Tribal" class, but only equipped with five 5-inch guns. Although other countries' destroyers have been equipped with larger-caliber guns, British experts still consider the 4.7-inch gun to be the best weapon for destroyers. The two new battleships built by Britain, the George V and the Prince of Wales, will both be equipped with 14-inch gun positions. The two large battleships currently under construction in France have 15-inch gun positions. Italian battleships are also the same. The caliber of the guns on one of the 35,000-ton new German battleships is unknown. In the past two years, it has been widely rumored that the navies of several countries have built hundreds of motor torpedo boats, but according to this report, this is not the case. As of 1930, Britain had a total of 13 such warships built and under construction, France had built three, Germany had a total of 15 completed and uncompleted, and the United States, Japan, and Russia had none. Italy has a total of 36, including those built in 1917 and 1918, with little difference from those built recently. (Special dispatch from the Zi Lin West Daily, 28th)

### German Ambassador to Britain Returns Home, British and French Newspapers Speculate

Germany Faces a Dilemma. National Socialist Party Actively Operating in England

(London) German Ambassador Ribbentrop left here the day before yesterday to return to his country. Although the stated purpose of this trip is to attend the opening ceremony of the Leipzig City Spring Fair in Germany, the newspapers here generally believe that the ambassador held talks with Foreign Secretary Eden the day before yesterday, and this trip is probably related to these talks. The diplomatic correspondent of the "Morning Post" declared that since the British government recently announced the amount of national defence expenditures, Germany must have felt that once this huge military build-up plan is completed, a large part of Germany's existing military equipment will be useless. Moreover, judging from the situation in the Spanish Civil War, the effectiveness of German military equipment is not as good as that of Soviet military equipment, which is also very obvious. From this, it can be seen that Germany's future is extremely bleak, and there are only two paths to follow in the future: one is to continue to engage in an arms race with various countries, but the result of the competition will inevitably be inferior; the other is to agree with these countries to stop expanding armaments. This is only left to the country to choose by itself. In short, today's situation is very unfavorable to Germany, and the country has often lost the opportunity to succeed in Europe." In addition, the Daily Herald and the News Chronicle both believe that after Ambassador Ribbentrop returns to his country this time, he will inevitably lose the favour of Führer Hitler, according to the Daily Herald, this is due to the machinations of Propaganda Minister Goebbels. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 1st)

(Paris) The German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, returned to London from London the day before yesterday. Among the newspapers in the French capital, only the right-wing "White Sun Daily" commented, saying: Ribbentrop was ordered to be an envoy to England, and the task he was entrusted with has now completely failed, because he had requested the British government to hold general negotiations on European issues, but British Foreign Secretary Eden remained unmoved, and only told the ambassador that, regarding the future Locarno Treaty issue, the British government had submitted a note on November 19 last year, but Germany had not yet replied, and recently Britain has again sent a letter to Germany, urging it to reply quickly. What the British government wants to know is whether Germany will guarantee the status quo in the Rhineland area, and whether the country will respect the independence of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Germany has not yet provided a satisfactory answer to this question, and the British government has really not been able to wait any longer. Therefore, after Ribbentrop returns to his country, if he cannot obtain a satisfactory answer from the German government, it is feared that there is no possibility of returning to his post." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 1st)

(London) The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, recently carried a report stating that the propaganda activities of the German National Socialist Party in the United Kingdom are now becoming increasingly developed. There are propaganda personnel sent by Germany distributing leaflets in various public houses in London and in British seaports, severely criticizing Jews and Communists. Many German students at British universities are also engaged in this work. In addition, German businessmen in London are very close to British people who can express sympathy for the National Socialist Party, in order to strengthen their connections.

(London) Lord President MacDonald recently gave a speech in Staines, Middlesex, reiterating his unwavering faith in the League of Nations, and believing that the various spiritual and material forces from which the League of Nations was founded would ultimately prevail. However, the League of Nations must include all the nations of the world before it can be effective. Those nations that have not yet joined the League of Nations must always make them feel that they will benefit by joining the League of Nations, otherwise there will be no benefit to these nations.

### German Residents in Czechoslovakia Demand Autonomy

Safeguarding Minority Rights

(Prague) Henlein, the leader of the Sudeten German Party in Czechoslovakia, today presented conditions to the Czech government, demanding that the western part of Czechoslovakia, where the German-speaking minority is most prominent, be guaranteed its autonomy. Henlein did not recognize the minority agreement formally announced by the Czech government on February 20, and gave a speech in Aussig today, claiming that the agreement concluded between the Czech government and the German mixed political party cannot satisfy the wishes of the three million German residents in Czechoslovakia, and said that the demand for autonomy does not infringe on the territorial integrity of Czechoslovakia. Henlein also claimed that if his demands are not accepted, he will file a protest with Geneva, accusing the Czech government of imposing cultural oppression on the German minority. Previously, the Czech government had made considerable concessions to the German minority in its territory, such as employing Germans in factories and government positions, and using the German language more appropriately.

### British Committee Releases Report on Hong Kong Maids

Conflicting Opinions Among Committee Members; Suggestions for Improving the System of Employing Maids

(London) The report released today by the Anti-Slavery Committee states that the British Colonial Office and the governments of Hong Kong, Malaya, and other regions have not ignored or been negligent regarding the trafficking of women and children. The report provides a detailed account of the structure of Chinese families, stating that maids are considered members of the family. Therefore, strictly speaking, the practice of employing maids cannot be immediately considered a source of prostitution, as it is rare for maids to become prostitutes. Regarding the number of maids, opinions vary, with some estimating hundreds and others as many as ten thousand. However, without conducting a household-by-household investigation, it is impossible to obtain an accurate figure. The report also states that the treatment of maids varies, but generally speaking, maids receive treatment that is not much worse than other members of the family. The report further points out that the existence of the maid system is entirely for domestic service, not for the exploitation of the poor. While instances of abuse, abandonment, or rape do occur, they are rare and severely punished if discovered. However, Chinese family life is rapidly evolving, and the maid system is perceived as unjust and is gradually being abolished. The report also provides the following recommendations for improving the maid system: ㊀ Employers should ensure fair treatment of maids; ㊁ The employment of girls under the age of twelve should be prohibited; ㊂ Registered maids should no longer be employed as maids once they reach the age of eighteen; ㊃ Registered maids under the age of fourteen should be visited at least three times every six months; ㊄ Maids over the age of fourteen should be visited at least four times a year; ㊅ Former prostitutes should be segregated and housed separately. Ms. Picton-Turbervill, the author of the report on the maid system, advocates that existing laws should be abolished and replaced with new legislation to expedite the abolition of the current system and ensure strict supervision. (Central News Agency, 1st Reuters dispatch)

(London) The report of the Anti-Slavery Committee on the issue of Hong Kong and Malayan maids can be broadly divided into two parts: the report of the majority of the committee members and the report of the minority. The report of the majority of the committee members, as mentioned in the previous telegram, recognizes maids as part of the Chinese family, whose purpose is to serve the family and not to exploit the poor. It also states that maids are not a source of prostitution and rarely become prostitutes. However, the report of the minority of the committee members is not as optimistic as the former and is not as satisfied with the current system as the other committee members. The majority of the committee's report provides a lengthy description of the Chinese family's practice of adopting daughters, but states that it is extremely difficult for Hong Kong maid owners to pass off maids as adopted daughters and deceive inspectors. As for the definition of a maid, it is recognized as a young girl who is transferred from one family to another to perform domestic work, receives no salary, and has no freedom to leave the employer. However, the difference between a maid and a domestic servant is that a maid is a member of the family, and when she reaches marriageable age (around eighteen), the employer arranges a suitable spouse for her to marry. The above is the report of the majority committee, signed by Chairman Sir Woodhead and Willis. Their views are the same as those of Sir Clementi, Sir Maxwell, the Roos Bay Committee, and the League of Nations Commission on Traffic in Women and Children, who have previously studied this issue. They also unequivocally state that maids and prostitutes cannot be compared, and that there are very few prostitutes who were previously maids. Therefore, under normal circumstances, maids are not exposed to moral danger. The report also states that the practice of employing maids in Hong Kong is rapidly being abolished. However, because the Chinese in Malaya are wealthier, the value of maids is also higher, so the reduction has not been as rapid as in Hong Kong, and registration is not as enthusiastic. However, according to what the investigators have personally witnessed, Malayan Chinese maids receive very good treatment. If one could start by punishing employers who fail to register, the same good results as in Hong Kong could be achieved. The report signed by the minority of committee members, Ms. Picton-Turbervill, expresses dissatisfaction with the current laws and requests that the thousands of unregistered maids in Hong Kong be dealt with immediately. Therefore, she advocates abolishing the existing Hong Kong and Malayan maid ordinances and replacing them with new legislation to promote the speedy abolition of the maid system. (Central News Agency, 1st Reuters dispatch)

(London) Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore stated in the Lower House today, in response to questions from Labour Party members, that the Colonial Office intends to consult with the Hong Kong and Malayan governments regarding the recommendations in the majority and minority reports of the Committee on Maid Issues and conduct a careful review.

Current Commentary

### Significance of the Indian National Congress Party Victory in Elections

— Auxiliary

At the end of last month, Reuters sent a dispatch from Mumbai stating the final results of the provincial elections under the new Indian constitution. The All-India National Congress Party has achieved unprecedented victories, gaining an absolute majority in administrative regions such as Mumbai and Madras, as well as in the United Provinces, Central Provinces, Bihar, and Orissa. In Bengal, Assam, and the Northwest Frontier Province, the Congress Party is the largest single party. Only in the Punjab and Sindh did the Congress Party receive fewer votes. The Congress Party's victory in Madras was particularly astonishing because the region had been the stronghold of the Justice Party for the past fourteen years. However, in this election, the Justice Party suffered a crushing defeat, winning only sixteen seats, while the Congress Party won one hundred and fifty-nine seats and gained a majority of twenty-six seats in the forty-six-seat upper house. The main reason the All-India National Congress Party was able to achieve such an unprecedented victory in this election is naturally due to their uniting voters from all classes and parties to fight for the independence and liberation of the Indian nation.

The holding of these provincial elections in British India is the initial procedure for implementing the new Indian constitution. This new constitution is the British imperialist's new magic weapon for ruling India. It was passed and announced in 1935 and is scheduled to be implemented on April 1 this year. The new constitution stipulates that India is a federal state, including the eleven provinces of British India and five hundred and sixty Indian princely states. The elections are now being held in the provinces of British India to organize parliaments, and then representatives will be elected from the British provinces, with one hundred and fifty-six members for the upper house and two hundred and fifty members for the lower house. The Indian princely states will elect one hundred and four representatives to the upper house and one hundred and twenty-five representatives to the lower house to form the Federal Upper House and Lower House. Under the new constitution, in addition to obtaining extremely limited autonomy, all important ruling powers remain in the hands of the Governor-General of India, specially appointed by the British Empire. Therefore, the National Congress Party has adopted a firm opposition to this new constitution. President Nehru also said that this constitution is "a chain of slavery" that must be broken.

Since the National Congress Party firmly opposes this "chain of slavery," why are they now participating in the provincial elections under this constitution and even achieving an unprecedented victory? This attitude may seem very contradictory at first glance, but in fact, there is a great principle behind it. This is stated very clearly in the declaration issued by the All-India National Congress held in Faizpur at the end of December last year. We can quote it as follows: "The Congress opposes the entire new constitution and clearly declares that any constitution formulated by foreign forces that hinders the sovereignty of the Indian people and does not recognize the Indian people's right to govern their political and economic organization is unacceptable. In order to prevent the strengthening of foreign rule and exploitation, the Congress has decided to participate in the upcoming provincial council elections. However, the purpose of the Congress representatives participating in the parliament is not to comply with the new constitution but to find ways to break it and end it."

As a result of these provincial elections, the Congress Party has gained a great victory. Therefore, they have a good chance of succeeding in their goal of shattering the new constitution. As for whether the Congress Party will participate in the organization of the provincial governments afterwards, the last Congress did not decide and must wait for the Executive Committee to decide at its meeting in Delhi this month. No matter how this question is decided in the future, the All-India National Congress's attitude of opposition to the new constitution will not change. The last Congress declaration stated, "Regardless of the resolution of this issue, we must remember that the Congress is absolutely opposed to this new constitution and will never cooperate with it. Our only goal is the end of the new constitution. Therefore, we must make every effort to prevent the implementation of this federal constitution, because the effect of this constitution is to allow imperialist and feudal interests to forever rule over the entire country of India and prevent all progress towards freedom."

India's national liberation movement has embarked on a clear path in recent years under the leadership of the All-India National Congress. The unprecedented advantage gained by the National Congress Party in the provincial elections is a symbol of the victory of the liberation movement. We, who are in a semi-colonial position, should not only celebrate the future of India's national liberation movement, but also reflect on ourselves and find ways to rescue ourselves from the trap of semi-colonialism.

### Japanese Delegation of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association Arrives in Shanghai

Expected to Arrive on the 14th; Kodama Discusses the Mission of This Trip

(Nanjing) The Japan-China Trade Association held a board meeting at 2:00 PM on the 1st and decided to invite Chairman Kodama and other directors to attend the general meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association in Shanghai on March 18. They also discussed and agreed on the selection of directors to attend. As a result, the official list of attendees from Tokyo is as follows:

Chairman Kenji Kodama, Director President of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) Noboru Ohtani, President of the Bank of Chosen (Korea) Keizo Kato, Employee of Mitsubishi Corporation Hyotaro Miyakegawa, President of Nisshin Spinning Co., Ltd. Seijiro Miyajima, Employee of Mitsui & Co., Ltd. Reisuke Ishida, President of Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (Nisshin Steamship Co., Ltd.) Hori, Akiyama from Mitsubishi Corporation, and Yutani, Director of the Japan-China Trade Association. From Osaka, there will be Managing Director of Sumitomo Bank, Ohira, and President of Toyo Spinning Co., Ltd. Iio. However, two or three more people will be added from Osaka. The group is scheduled to depart from Kobe on the Nagasaki Maru on March 12 and arrive in Shanghai on the 14th.

After the board meeting, Chairman Kodama gave a speech stating that he was attending the general meeting at the invitation of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association. According to the association's charter, the meeting should have been held in the spring of last year, but it was suspended due to a sudden incident on the Japanese side. It was then postponed to autumn, but due to the not-so-good relations between China and Japan at the time, it was rescheduled for this spring. The Chinese side seems to have very high expectations for them, or may propose substantial counter-proposals on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. He said that he would do his best to acknowledge the other party's requests and hopes. Since returning to Japan from his position as the branch manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank in Shanghai in 1920, he has not visited China. Although he does not know any young Chinese people, he knows many people such as Chiang Kai-shek and other financial leaders. Therefore, he plans to meet with various key figures in the Nanjing government. As for Yasukawa, the president of the East Asia Development Company (Taku), he plans to inspect Manchuria and North China and will likely return to Shanghai around April. Therefore, they will not be able to travel together with him. (1st Allied Press dispatch)

### British Circles Pay Close Attention to Japanese Prime Minister's Pro-British Policy

The Netherlands Unwilling to Sign Non-Aggression Treaty; Japan Plans to Improve Relations with Russia

(London) Circles here concerned with Far Eastern affairs are paying close attention to the speech given yesterday in the House of Representatives by Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senjuro Hayashi regarding Japan's desire to increase Anglo-Japanese friendship and to resolve the immigration issue with Australia. Many acknowledge the sincerity of Mr. Hayashi and believe that his words represent the views of the Japanese military and should be considered separately from the statements made by civil servants. Former Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Newton told a Reuters reporter today, "I have always regretted the dissolution of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. I firmly believe that restoring close Anglo-Japanese relations will lead to peace and security in the Far East and will directly benefit China." Sir Frederick Whyte, who served as a political advisor to the Chinese government from 1929 to 1932, believes that Japan has now realized that it must work to eliminate the effects of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany abroad. Furthermore, a banker in the Far East expressed the view that some people are now guiding the United States to lean towards a mutual assistance agreement between France and Russia, which Japan is deeply concerned about, so it is seeking ways to counter it. Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Bruce mentioned the Japanese immigration issue, saying that he was unaware of any hope of discussing the immigration issue in the near future. This is purely an economic issue and has nothing to do with the human aspect. The Australian people mostly love and admire the Japanese people, but we are constantly seeking to maintain a certain standard of living for all types of workers.

⊙The Hague Someone inquired of a key figure today about the attitude of the Dutch authorities regarding the issue of Japan's Prime Minister Hayashi's statement in parliament yesterday that Japan would study the possibility of concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Netherlands and seeking to lease the Dutch New Guinea island. The reply was that concluding a non-aggression treaty is not in line with the Dutch government's policies. Japan stated that the right to cede New Guinea would be considered by the Dutch East Indies government. However, it should be known that the Dutch government has already granted several rights to cede cottonwood on the islands of New Guinea and Borneo to Japan. The official also firmly stated that the Dutch government is now pursuing an open-door policy in the Dutch East Indies. (Central News Agency, 1st Reuters dispatch)

(Nanjing) It is heard that Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hayashi will soon instruct Japanese Ambassador to Russia Mamoru Shigemitsu to eliminate the Soviet authorities' misunderstanding of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany in order to improve relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. The procedure for this has not yet been revealed. However, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun, this move may be a prelude to Japan slightly delaying the submission of certain economic and cultural proposals to the Soviet Union. The newspaper also stated that many officials in Tokyo now feel that the anti-Japanese atmosphere in the Soviet Union has reached its extreme, so they believe that the cabinet should urgently take action to improve this situation so that Japan's "Far East stabilizing force" can be stabilized.

### Japanese Seamen's Strike Expands

Sino-Japanese Services Operate as Usual

(Nanjing) The Meirokai (Bright Enlightenment Association) of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) suddenly launched a reform movement on the 28th under the banner of reforming the company's concept of national polity (Kokutai Meicho). At the same time, they telegraphed crew members on ships anchored at Osaka, Kobe, and Yokohama, as well as those currently sailing in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and nearby waters, ordering them to leave their ships. Forty-five land-based employees in Tokyo and Yokohama, as well as crew members on ships in Yokohama, gathered at the training hall operated by Eigoro Matsuda in Nishisugamo-cho, Toshima Ward, after receiving the order. The headquarters of the strike group at the Keihin Ryokan in front of Shinagawa Station considered countermeasures overnight. The company authorities were very alarmed by the sudden strike and dispatched the deputy director of the maritime affairs department to the Metropolitan Police Department yesterday afternoon to meet with Mr. Kitamura, the head of the labor section, to explain the entire situation. After the Meirokai launched the strike, various Japanist groups, such as the Current Affairs Council, the Political Reform Council, and the New Japan Seamen's Union, actively supported it, and the momentum was very strong. The strike leaders are determined to fight to the end in order to achieve their demands and are preparing for a long-term strike. Regarding the dispute of the Meirokai, the shipping company has decided to firmly adhere to the policy of dismissal based on Article 581 of the Commercial Code and Article 26 of the Seamen's Law. The chief engineer and four other engineers of the List Bow Maru, as well as the third-class engineer of the Malacca Maru, have already been dismissed as a result and replacements have been made. As a result, the ships that departed from Kobe on the 1st were delayed for several hours due to dismissals and replacements, but they have all left port. (1st Allied Press dispatch)

### Russia Arrests and Deports German Residents

Some Said to Be Unwilling to Leave

(Moscow) Nine German residents who were arrested in Leningrad in November last year on charges of espionage and counter-revolution have recently been escorted by officials to the border between the Soviet Union and Poland and expelled. (Central News Agency, 1st Havas dispatch)

(Moscow) Several Germans in Moscow and Leningrad who were arrested in mid-November last year on charges of counter-revolution and espionage were decided by the Soviet Interior Ministry on February 16 to be deported. On the 27th of last month, a counselor from the German Embassy met with representatives from the Foreign and Interior Ministries and talked with the deportees for two hours. During the conversation, Tito and Fefa told the German counselor that they did not want to return to Germany. Fefa said that he would rather stay in the Soviet Union and serve his sentence. If he had to be sent back to Germany, he would commit suicide when crossing the border. Tito requested to be sent to another country, claiming that he could prove that he was also a British citizen. Tito, Gaerxi, Mid, and Merche were sent out of the Soviet-Polish border yesterday. After Tito crossed the border, he had the opportunity to resolve his citizenship and place of residence. Fefa's deportation was temporarily suspended in order to obtain an entry passport to another country.

### An Overview of the Situation in Spain

Government Forces Shift from Defense to Offense; British Newspaper Correspondent's Observations

(London)

Bertolot, a reporter for the News Article Newspaper, recently went to the territory controlled by the Spanish government forces to conduct an on-site investigation. He recently published an article on the findings, stating: "The most serious problem facing the government is the issue of internal organization. The country urgently needs a leader like Napoleon of France. Unfortunately, there are no talents there sufficient to speak of this. The government forces have now changed their strategy from defense to offense. Assigning the troops of the Central Route Army to General Miaja, Chairman of the Madrid City Defense Committee, for his personal command is the first step in changing the strategy. It is expected that the Valencia government will also appoint commissioners to control food supply and transportation matters. If the traffic conditions between Madrid and Valencia can be improved as soon as possible, the government forces will certainly have a great advantage in the future of the war. For example, Madrid's supply is in danger of being depleted, but if it is said that its source is exhausted, it is better to say that its distribution is not good. This can be seen in the supply of kerosene." As for personnel matters, Premier Caballero was an indispensable figure at the beginning of the civil war, and contributed a lot to unity at that time. Up until now, all parties and factions have eliminated prejudices in order to win the final victory, so Caballero's age and position are not as important as before. In addition, the military talents of General Miaja, Chairman of the Defense Committee, are still not recognized by the general public. "But judging from the current situation, it is increasingly impossible for the Nationalists to directly capture Madrid. If the security of transportation in the government-controlled area, the security of the city of Valencia, and even the security of the entire Spain, are to be maintained, then the leaders of the political and military circles must show greater courage and a greater spirit of sacrifice, just as the Basque Autonomous Region troops on the front line of the Manzanares River south of the capital have done, in order to succeed. When I inspected the front line, every soldier of the region was able to bravely fight the enemy without fear. This is truly commendable." (Central News Agency, 1st Havas dispatch)

### Fierce Artillery Battles Around Madrid

Government Army Positions Consolidated

⊙Madrid Government forces bombarded the university city district today with artillery fire. The rebels did not return fire, apparently to save ammunition. At the same time, government forces on the southern front launched a surprise attack with artillery and Russian tanks. Three tanks were destroyed by the rebels. One of them was captured by the rebels near Cubretura. However, government forces are still trying to use hand grenades to break through the rebel machine gun teams there. In the Jarama River area, the rebels launched a fierce attack for several hours, but made no progress. (28th National News dispatch)

⊙Madrid The town of Maranosa, near the Garama River, southeast of the capital, is now surrounded by government forces. This morning, Nationalist forces launched several attacks in an attempt to drive back government forces, but after fighting fiercely for several hours, the government forces' positions remained unmoved. The Nationalist forces eventually retreated without success. In addition, Nationalist forces in the Toledo area south of the capital are now relying on fortifications around the northeastern gate of the city to defend it. Government forces took advantage of their unpreparedness and raided the Nationalist forces' positions, and after reconnaissance of the terrain, safely withdrew.

### Spanish Nationalist Forces Deny Executing Hollywood Actress

⊙Avila: A foreign report stated that Ms. Diss, an American Hollywood movie star, was arrested by the Nationalist forces in Seville, southern Spain, for being a spy for the Spanish government army. After a trial, she was sentenced to death by firing squad. Local authorities here recently denied this claim, stating that Ms. Diss had already traveled to Portugal and is currently still within Portuguese territory.

### Unfortunate Incident in Wuchang: Clash Between Students and Soldiers

Bo Wen Middle School Surrounded and Fired Upon by Garrison Troops; Principal Petitions Education Bureau to Request Protection from Authorities

Hankou Dispatch: At 1 p.m. on the 27th, Bo Wen Middle School in Wuchang and the nearby stationed army heavy mortar battalion had a dispute over a trivial matter between a student and the battalion's company commander, leading to a clash. This resulted in an unfortunate incident involving a demonstration of gunfire and the surrounding of the school. The school is located outside the Dadongmen gate, midway along the Wuluo Motor Road. Most of the students are from Wuhan. The Road Bureau, to facilitate the students, set up a station outside the school. The 27th was a Saturday, and the afternoon was a regular holiday. Many students were waiting at the station to return home. At about 1 p.m., a bus arrived from Wuhan University in Luojia Mountain. As the students were about to board, Xiong Zaixun, the company commander of the army heavy mortar battalion, and a platoon leader stood in the doorway, making it difficult for the students to board. The students asked them to make way, but they refused to pay attention. Ji Yuan, a freshman at the school, who was very young, stepped forward to negotiate. A misunderstanding arose during the conversation, and the company commander struck him with a heavy blow. The student then retaliated against Xiong, and a conflict broke out. Cai Huifu, the school principal, Dong Zhengchu, the director of education, Xiao Guogui, the director of discipline, and Wang Rongwu, the military instructor, rushed to the scene. They restrained the students and invited Xiong into the school to talk, hoping to resolve the matter peacefully. Unexpectedly, a platoon leader who followed Xiong, seeing Xiong enter the school, ran back to the company headquarters and urgently summoned sixty armed soldiers, who set off for the school. The company headquarters was stationed at Changchun Temple, which was only a few steps away from the school, and they arrived in an instant. They immediately surrounded the school and fired more than twenty shots in a show of force. Teachers and staff who went out to mediate were beaten severely with gun butts, and a school worker was also injured. Many doors and windows were damaged, and the situation was very serious. Nearby residents were panicked, and order almost broke down. Gao Jieying, a patrol officer from the Third Police Sub-Bureau, quickly led more than ten police officers to suppress the situation. The soldiers refused to be restrained, and a conflict with the police officers was about to erupt. Fortunately, Lin Liqiu, the company commander of the special company of the military police battalion, arrived with many military police officers and worked together to resolve the situation. Only then did Company Commander Xiong order the soldiers to retreat. Shortly after, Liu Ganyan, the adjutant of the Wuchang District Command of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, and Kong Fanmei, the battalion commander of the battalion, arrived at the school to investigate the truth of the incident. After discussions among all parties, it was decided that Battalion Commander Kong would be responsible for the demonstration of gunfire and surrounding the school, and the company and platoon leaders would be punished. Principal Cai would be responsible for investigating and punishing the students who made inappropriate remarks. Both sides restrained the soldiers and students, preventing further clashes. The major crisis was temporarily calmed down. However, the school authorities, fearing that the school and the company's garrison were in close proximity, and that other incidents might arise in the future, Principal Cai went to the Education Bureau to personally report everything to Director Zhou. Today, he submitted another report to the Education Bureau, requesting that it be forwarded to the highest military authorities for protection. (28th)

### Southwest Airlines Plane "Chang Geng" Lost in Fog

Wu Bofan and Pilot Perish Together

Guangzhou Dispatch: Southwest Airlines has been flying two or three planes between Guangdong and Guangxi. Recently, the company was reorganized, with increased capital from Yunnan and Guizhou. The company's business will soon expand greatly, opening routes to Yunnan and Guizhou. The civilian aircraft purchased by the company will soon be shipped from the United States to Guangdong. Once the new aircraft arrive, they will fly to Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. However, recently, the capital of Guangxi Province moved to Guilin, and the Southwest Airlines planes have also changed their route to the Guilin line. They take off from Guangzhou, first arrive in Guilin, then go through Liuzhou, and then to Nanning (previously, they went from Guangzhou through Wuzhou, passing Guixian, and directly to Yongcheng). Recently, Dr. Wu Bofan, a consultant to the Shaanxi Provincial Government and an expert in developing alcohol as a substitute for gasoline, was invited by Guangdong to come to Guangdong to test the use of alcohol as a substitute for gasoline. The test results were excellent. After staying in Guangdong for several weeks, the Guangxi Provincial authorities, having heard of Wu's reputation, also telegraphed Wu to go to Guangxi to test his method of using alcohol as a substitute for gasoline. With the introduction of Kan Zonghua, the director of the Guangxi Pacification Commissioner's Office in Guangdong, Wu agreed to fly to Guilin on the Southwest Airlines plane "Chang Geng" on February 22. Unexpectedly, after flying from Guangzhou for only a few tens of minutes, when they regularly reached the jurisdiction of Sanshui County, the weather suddenly changed, and a thick fog covered the sky. The pilot, finding it difficult to navigate in the fog, planned to temporarily land in the jurisdiction of Sanshui County. Unexpectedly, the aircraft suddenly malfunctioned at this time, and plummeted from a height of over a thousand feet. The Sanshui County Government, upon hearing the news, assumed that the crashed aircraft had landed on land and immediately sent people to investigate. However, they could not find any trace of it. Later, according to reports from local people, there was a slick of gasoline floating on the surface of the Qingqi River near Shangduanfeng Township in the jurisdiction of Sanshui County, suspected that the crashed aircraft had fallen into the water. In addition to sending people to salvage, they also telegraphed the province to report to the relevant authorities. Southwest Airlines, upon receiving the report, immediately sent personnel to investigate. At the same time, the Fourth Route Army Headquarters also sent Luo Guangqian, a section chief from the Adjutant's Office, and Adjutant Liu Zhao to Sanshui to inquire about everything. On the 24th, they hired people in the Sanshui River to dive and salvage the "Chang Geng" aircraft that had fallen into the water, but it was still nowhere to be found. It is expected that if the aircraft did fall into the water, then the people on board would have been drowned and could not be saved. Many who heard the news mourned. It was found that on that day, there was only one passenger on the plane, Wu Bofan, and a small amount of mail. The pilot was Zhan Daoyu. Zhan was the son of an overseas Chinese. He graduated from the former Guangdong Aviation School and had many years of service in Southwest Airlines. His skills were quite proficient. This incident was truly unexpected.

### Soldiers of the Hailianhui in Zhanhua County, Shandong Mutiny

Resisting Orders and Opening Fire, Refusing to Be Accepted; Liu Yaoting Dispatches Troops to Suppress, Now Disbanded; Mutiny Leader Gao Shutang and Others Escorted to Ji'nan for Trial

Jinan Dispatch: Bin County, Putai, Lijin, Zhanhua, Wudi, and other counties in northern Shandong are located near the sea, with complex harbors and bays. Sea bandits often disturb the local area. Although there is an organization called the Hailianhui (Sea Defense Association), its capabilities are still limited. Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, in order to thoroughly eliminate bandits and consolidate the sea defense of northern Shandong, specially appointed Liu Yaoting, the deputy commander of the Fifth Security District of Shandong Province and the captain of the Third Special Investigation Team, as the commander of the Northern Shandong Maritime Security Team, and Zhu Shiqin, the captain of the Fourth Special Investigation Team, as the deputy commander. The original three squadrons of the Hailianhui were transferred to Liu for reorganization. Upon receiving the order, Liu led Deputy Commander Zhu Shiqin and others to Xiawa in Zhanhua County a few days ago to take over the Hailianhui and establish the Maritime Security Headquarters. The First Squadron of the Hailianhui stationed in Xiawa, led by Wang Gongchen, obeyed the order to reorganize. Liu then dispatched Deputy Commander Zhu Shiqin to Jiushan Village in Zhanhua on the 26th to take over the Second Squadron, led by Gao Shutang. Gao Shutang refused to be accepted, and even deployed troops in a show of force. That night, they mutinied. Zhu immediately returned to Xiawa and reported to Liu. Liu then dispatched Wang Gongchen, the captain of the First Squadron of the Maritime Security Team, together with Zhu, leading the security team and more than a hundred investigators to quell the rebellion. Zhu and others arrived at Jiushan Village early this morning (the 27th). Gao Shutang actually led the rebellious troops to open fire in resistance. After three hours of fierce fighting, they were finally captured, and his deputy captain was killed, along with four rebellious soldiers. The rest were all captured, totaling more than fifty people, and taken to Xiawa. Liu escorted the mutiny leader Gao Shutang and eight others to Jinan that night, to be handed over to the military law department of the Third Route Army Headquarters for legal action tomorrow (the 28th). Liu also decided to visit Chairman Han tomorrow (the 28th) to report on the events. The remaining rebellious soldiers have been detained in Xiawa to await orders for handling.

### Summary of Sino-British Continued Survey of the Southern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Boundary

—Location: Lao Chang, in the Hinterland of Yunnan Province—(Continued)

Border New Year's Day

The first day of January in the 26th year [of the Republic] was New Year's Day and the anniversary of the founding of the Republic. The Chinese commissioners held a rare celebration of the Republic's founding and a group greeting ceremony. At about 10 a.m., all the staff, guards, officers and soldiers, as well as the various chieftain (Tusi), gathered at the meeting ground to participate. Commissioners Liang and Zhang successively gave speeches, briefly stating that the founding of the Republic was difficult, and that such a grand event on the border was even more rare. We should embody this spirit, strive to promote and carry forward the traditions of our predecessors, and so on.

Formal Meeting

The Boundary Survey Committee scheduled its first session of the term for January 2nd at our camp, continuing from the previous term (referred to as the 68th meeting). At 10 a.m., Neutral Chairman Mr. E and Secretary Mr. P arrived first, followed by the British commissioners and Secretary Mr. C. At 10:20 a.m., the meeting began. First, Mr. E gave a speech, briefly describing the process by which the Political Bureau of the League of Nations notified them of the second Sino-British joint survey of the Yunnan-Burma border. He then stated the reasons for deciding on Lao Chang as the meeting place, and then inquired in detail about the security, sanitation, transportation, and other items of both sides. He then recited Article 3 of the supplementary provisions of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of the 23rd year of Guangxu (i.e., 1897), stating the scope of the work this time. He also briefly mentioned the procedures for this term's work. The meeting adjourned at 11 a.m. The Chinese commissioners held a banquet that day for the neutral chairman and his secretary, as well as the British commissioners, their secretary, and the officers of the guards. After the meeting adjourned, there was a short rest, and at 1 p.m. everyone took their seats. The guests and hosts parted happily at 3 p.m. In the days that followed, meetings and on-site surveys continued, and everyone was extremely busy.

National Concern

Yunnan Province is located on the border. Since the Pan Hong Incident, the Chinese people have begun to pay attention to the Yunnan border. Since the last Sino-British joint survey, news about the border has repeatedly appeared in newspapers. Although all parties have a clear idea of the Yunnan border, many still do not understand the intention of the joint survey and have misunderstandings. Some mistakenly believe that this survey is a "border demarcation," and others mistakenly believe that it is a "border definition," as if the boundary line would be determined after the survey. There are quite a few people who hold this view. Commissioners Liang and Zhang have already explained this in a speech at the Yunnan Provincial Party Headquarters last January. There are still some who do not understand the joint survey based on the treaty and have questions about the measurement of the undefined boundary area by both parties. The Chinese Commissioners' Office has separately answered them in letters. Among them, the official letter from the office to a certain county council is the most clear. The letter is as follows (omitted above): "Regarding the first point, the so-called western boundary of Lancang should be extended to the Nujiang River" truly encompasses the entire territory of Wa, Shan, and others west of the Nanjian River. However, this statement is close to ideal. It is neither recorded in the treaty nor included in the Zhenbian map. Liu and Chen's boundary survey also strictly adhered to Laimu Nanka and have not heard of any proposal to reach Gunlong in the west. This commissioner was ordered by the central government to survey the national border and conduct foreign negotiations, all based on the treaty. Abandoning the treaty and relying on ideals, I am deeply afraid that it will be difficult to convince people. The Guangxu 23rd year treaty should be adhered to in good faith. The third item, fourth section, states: "The area of Zhenbian Hall belongs to China, following the Shun Nanjian River... Mengyun belongs to China, Menglun belongs to Britain, etc." This commissioner has not heard that the western boundary of Zhenbian can reach the Nujiang River, so it is not convenient to violate the treaty and make a statement that would be taken lightly. Conducting a survey based on the treaty is a policy that has been determined by the central government. This commissioner恪 keeps the 部令, conducts the boundary affairs, and the authority is limited, and should be understood by the people of the country. As for Lao Chang and other places are all in the hinterland of Yunnan, which is known to China and foreign countries, the British side came here to measure is one thing, and the delimitation of the boundary is another thing, not to say that the land once measured by the other side of the sovereignty will be lost, or that the undefined boundary, is referred to as the Scott-Kirk Red Line and the Liu-Chen-Huang Line area. The British side carried out surveys in areas outside the red line, and our side also sent personnel to conduct surveys in Huban, Feima Mountain, Nangun River, Bangge, Lufang and other places outside the yellow line, and drew detailed maps. There is a mutual understanding, so that the staff of both sides can be facilitated, and is responsible for protection, this method, has long been the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lei Da Yunnan Provincial Government to check on file, this member also reiterated in the previous session, all measurement business, purely technical work, and the sovereignty of both sides, completely irrelevant, this section has been filed, and by the neutral chairman, added to the supervision, to avoid the bad to say that, "Lufang although the British army stationed, after all, can not be regarded as their own" one section seems to be a misunderstanding, our side sent personnel to the site to measure, originally no need to consult the British army agreed, agreed to say, is the British side in view of the Committee's decision, and to express its attitude this commissioner does not recognize the military occupation as legitimate, also do not work the British army agreed and then sent personnel to carry out the test, scrolls are in place, can be reviewed, the above two points, through explanation, can be understood, in short, this committee to deal with the boundary affairs, the internal恪 follow the 部令, 外 then according to the treaty to fight, duty, position such as this, in addition to the provincial party headquarters in the speech has been detailed in Chen said that this quasi-forward, the corresponding reply."

The latest developments, I heard that on January 14th, both sides had moved to Mengsuo for more detailed discussions.

### Kunshan Strictly Prohibits Police from Growing Hair

The County Police Bureau previously issued an order to its members, prohibiting them from growing hair, and strictly stipulated penalties. Now, with the passage of time, it is feared that old habits may reappear, which would violate the original intention of the New Life Movement. Dong Xueshu, the bureau chief, re-emphasized the previous order on the 28th, stipulating that those who have already grown hair must shave it off completely today. Those who violate the order after the deadline will be severely punished. All officers are ordered to be responsible for reporting violations, otherwise they will be held jointly liable, in order to emphasize the importance of the order.

### Wuxi Flour Mills All Profitable

In this county, besides Tailong Flour Mill, which was burned down last year, there are also Jiufeng and Maoxin Nos. 1 and 2 Mills. They produce a large quantity of flour every year, which is sold to various places. Business is thriving. Last year, each mill had a profit of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. In addition, there are more than 30 flour bran shops, including Hengmao, Hengxie, Wanfengchang, Taifeng, Yifeng, Yongyuanfeng, etc. Last year, due to the soaring price of flour, all the shops made a large profit. Those with a larger business scope could make a profit of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, while smaller ones could make 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. At present, the price of flour in Wuxi is lower than last year. Green Mountain Deer brand flour is sold for 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 1 to 2 fen per bag.

### Changzhou County Government Surveys and Builds Wu Huang Road

The county government believes that the transportation in Huangli Town, the ninth district of the county, has always been inconvenient. Usually, people rely on boats for travel, and the distance is 60 li long. Therefore, it is planned to build a highway in order to promote the development of agriculture and commerce. Technical staff member Yu Mengyin has been dispatched to start surveying the road. It is estimated that it will be 30 kilometers long, passing through the first, second, and ninth districts. The width is set at 7.5 meters. The roadbed will be built by requisitioning labor. After completion, bids will be invited from merchants to contract for the operation of cars. Once the survey is completed, drawings will be made, and a budget will be prepared and submitted to the department for approval to start construction.

### Nantong

Difficulties in Opening Traffic at Langfu Ferry

Jiangnan and Jiangbei traffic is blocked. People from various counties in Tongzhou advocate opening a ferry on the Jiangmian River at Langfu Ferry in Nantong Changshu, so that Jiangnan and Jiangbei highway traffic can be connected. The nautical community representatives have surveyed and reported that the shoals on both sides are too long and difficult to ascend and descend, so it is difficult to open this traffic.

### Employee of Haizhou Telegraph Bureau Murdered

Wang Zhilan, a native of Xiangshuikou, Guanyun County, 27 years old, worked as a telegraph operator at the local telegraph bureau. The night before, he was murdered with a kitchen knife in the bedroom of Zhang Xiaoyun, the female director of the Haifeng Hospital. The next morning, a villager named Wang took his young child to the hospital for treatment. He walked into the hospital gate, but there was no sound. He walked to the back room and caught sight of a corpse with more than ten knife wounds, lying in a pool of blood. It was a terrible sight. Two kitchen knives were discarded on the ground. Wang was frightened and screamed wildly. Neighbors gathered from all directions. Someone who recognized the deceased ran to tell his family. His family rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and mourned over the body. The people in the hospital had already fled. The deceased's family immediately reported to the county government to send someone to investigate and arrest the murderer.

### Tokyo World Games Organizing Committee Discusses Remodeling Construction Venues

Ministry of Finance Allocates 5 Million Gold

(Tokyo Correspondence) The World Games Organizing Committee held its tenth meeting at the residence of the Minister of Education (Ministry of Education) in Tokyo, Japan, at 2:00 PM on the 23rd. Attendees included Vice-Chairmen Oshima and Tejima, Commissioners Kawahara, Hiranuma, Kano, Soejima, Okubo, Mori, and Shinohara, Alternate Commissioners Ta Anan, Tashiro, and Sugiura, and Secretaries Kubota, Kurimoto, and Kusama. First, the chairman reported on the progress of determining the venues and the results of various studies. Regarding the current remodeling plan for the swimming pool and the covering work on the railway line, the Ministry of Railways replied that it could be done. The track at Toyama School was also deemed usable. The entire meeting unanimously agreed to pass the following resolutions: ㊀ Athletics Field: It was decided to remodel the Gaien Athletics Field. ㊁ Ball Fields: Located at the site of the Aoyama Shooting Range. ㊂ Swimming Pools: Divided into two locations, one being the renovated Meiji Jingu Swimming Pool, and the other being a newly built one in Shiba Park. ㊃ Cycling Track: Located in Shibaura. ㊄ Motorboat Racing: Located in Ominato. ㊅ Rowing: Located in Toda Village. ㊆ Olympic Village: Located in Kinuta Village.

Educational News

### Teacher Zhang ChuanDao of E Province Middle School Accuses Director Zhou TianFang of the Education Department

Zhang Requested to See Zhou But Did Not Meet, Made Harsh Remarks - Zhou Arrested Zhang for Insulting a Superior - The Court Accepted the Case and the Debate Between Both Parties Concluded

Hankou Correspondence: After the newly appointed Director of the Education Department, Zhou Tianfang, took office, Zhang ChuanDao, a teacher at the Provincial Zhongxiang Middle School, visited him to present his views on educational reform. Because he failed to meet Zhou twice, his language inevitably insulted Zhou's dignity. Zhou, therefore, arrested Zhang on charges of insulting a superior, destroying public property, and obstructing official duties, and sent him to the Provincial Police Department, who transferred him to the Wuchang District Court for legal proceedings. Zhang also hired lawyers Wang Zhaoxiang, Xia Rishi, and Zhang Jixiang to file a complaint against Zhou for abusing his authority, dereliction of duty, infringing on freedom, and fabricating false charges. The court accepted the case, and at 2:30 PM on the 27th, the criminal division of the court opened the trial in the first courtroom. Liu Xianji served as the presiding judge. Because the defendant was the current Director of the Education Department, and he was in court against his subordinate teacher, the visitor seats were very crowded. However, Zhou did not personally attend the hearing due to official duties. After the court opened, the presiding judge first questioned the plaintiff about the four parts of the charges: abuse of power, dereliction of duty, infringement of freedom, and fabrication of false charges. Zhang testified, "On the afternoon of January 15th, I went to the Education Department to visit Director Zhou to present my views on education. The secretary, Yu Longxi, met me on his behalf. He said that the Director was busy and arranged for me to visit again at 2:00 PM on the 17th. I went on time on the 17th and first handed my business card to the reception. I was led into the reception room, and the receptionist then told me that the Director would not see me. I told him that Secretary Yu had made an appointment beforehand, so why would he not see me? Because educational officials should not have this bureaucratic habit. I told the receptionist to report again. Soon, the receptionist came back and told me to wait in the reception room. By 4:00 PM, he still hadn't come out, so I left the Department and returned home. Unexpectedly, as I was leaving the Provincial Government gate, armed guards rushed up and said that the Director would see me and ordered me to turn back. At the same time, they ordered the sentry at the Provincial Government gate to prevent me from leaving. Then, a platoon leader of the Education Department's guards, named Su, held a letter from the Education Department, saying that he was ordered to send me to the Provincial Police Department. After I was taken to the Police Department, I was detained overnight and then transferred to the Prosecutor's Office of the Court. The Education Department's letter stated that I had insulted a superior, damaged public property, and obstructed official duties. This was an abuse of authority and illegal arrest, so I filed a private prosecution." Next, the defendant Zhou Tianfang was summoned. Zhou did not appear, and the Education Department's secretary, Yu Longxi, appeared in court and testified that Zhang ChuanDao had come to the Department on the 15th in the name of a graduate of the Central University to visit the Director. Because the Director was in a meeting, he met him on his behalf. Zhang insisted on seeing the Director, and before leaving, he requested to come again at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th. This was only his unilateral request, and he did not agree. Later, he reported to the Director, but the Director did not comment. On the afternoon of the 17th, when Zhang came, he was not in the Department. At about 4:00 PM, when he arrived at the Department, he heard Zhang speaking loudly in front of the reception room, saying, "Secretary Yu made an appointment for me to come, so why won't he see me?" He immediately came out and stated that there was no appointment. Zhang then said many offensive words, such as, "What kind of bureaucratic airs are you putting on as an educational official? If you want to put on airs, why come to Hubei to be an official? If you went to a puppet country to be a traitor, you might even become a minister. In this time of national crisis, you are still putting on bureaucratic airs. What a bastard!" Director Zhou was therefore angry and reported to the Acting Chairman Lu and sent him to the police department. When Zhang was shouting, many officials from the Education Department and the Finance Department came to watch. Witnesses can be summoned for questioning." Next, the witnesses Wu Zhongya, a supervisor of the Education Department, Chen Zihe, a clerk of the Finance Department, and the receptionist of the Education Department, were questioned. Their statements were the same as Yu's statement, but there were slight discrepancies in the time. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer raised four points and asked the court to pay attention to them: ㊀ All citizens are equal under the law. Zhou Tianfang, as a criminal defendant, refused to appear in court, which is a disregard for the dignity of the law and should be arrested and brought to court. ㊁ Except for military police, other officials have no right to arrest criminals. Zhou directly ordered the guards to arrest Zhang, which is a violation of Article 134 of the Criminal Code. ㊂ The times mentioned by the witnesses when Zhang caused trouble in the Education Department are different, which can prove that this did not happen. Zhou fabricated false charges. ㊃ Since the defendant did not appear in court today, he should be summoned again on a fixed date. At this point, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate and set March 1st for the verdict. (28th)

Shenbao Medicine Special Issue

### Where is Our Medical Construction?

— Hua Xinren

Currently, there is a fashionable ideology in our health circles, shouted out by a group of senior health officials sitting in comfortable offices in tall Western-style buildings, which is the so-called "medical construction." Thinking about it calmly, this is just like "writing proletarian literature while sitting on a sofa," because this is how they want to gain public trust, just like politicians using political tricks to prolong their political lives.

Where is our medical construction? Now I will list the statistics of the United States and China for comparison:

(A) China has a population of 400,000,000, with 7,881 qualified doctors nationwide (referring to those with ministerial licenses). On average, there is one doctor for every 50,000 people. There are 5,000 nurses nationwide, with an average of one nurse for every 80,000 people. There are 50,000 hospital beds nationwide, with an average of one bed for every 10,000 people. The disease rate is 3%.

(B) The United States has a population of 106,775,046, with a total of 140,000 doctors nationwide, averaging one doctor for every 900 people. There are 23,800 nurses nationwide, with an average of one nurse for every 600 people. There are 990,903 hospital beds nationwide, with an average of one bed for every 100 people. The disease rate is 0.15%.

Where is our medical construction? I want to ask our wise authorities, is having only one doctor for every 50,000 people providing healthcare for the people? Is having one hospital bed for every 10,000 people a public medical system? I want to ask, where is our medical construction? The average annual death toll in our country is six million, and the number of deaths due to injustice is also six million (referring to those who do not have access to medical care). The annual economic loss due to excess deaths exceeds 300 million yuan. If this funding were used for construction, we could complete 1,000 universities, 100,000 elementary schools, 5,000 hospitals, 600 waterworks, 100,000 miles of roads, 20,000 airplanes, 30,000 miles of railways, and 800 factories. Looking at the average life expectancy of our people, they can only live to 30 years old, and can only serve in society for 15 years. Looking at these statistical figures, it's probably a bit "shocking," right? What do we urgently need now? Of course, it is "medical construction."

Under the slogan of medical construction, the first step is to increase the number of medical personnel. We want to reduce the mortality rate, improve people's health, and not flaunt new ideologies and shout nice-sounding slogans that can be accomplished, but rather prove the facts with practical methods. Therefore, I say that it is not easy for these specially appointed and simplified health officials to complete this work. Furthermore, "dying of illness" is the most unfortunate thing in the world. Imagine, with only one doctor for every 50,000 people, what do we do when we get sick? In addition, we can see so many patients in the outpatient departments of every hospital, truly as crowded as the road on Shanyin. How eagerly they are seeking a glance from the doctor! Of course, the rich and important people can hire a personal doctor as their exclusive physician when they are sick, or even find a foreign doctor for examination, or even go abroad for treatment. But what about the other poor people? Therefore, to revive the nation and strengthen national power, medical construction is urgently needed. The medical specialist examination held by the Ministry of Health this time, in principle, we feel is suitable for application under the conditions of medical construction, but in terms of method, we have a few points to raise for discussion:

(1) What are the conditions and standards for the selection of members of the Physician Appraisal Committee?

(2) What is the meaning of this appraisal? Is it for the health of the people? Is it for medical construction? Is it to perfunctorily meet the demands of general public opinion?

(3) Is the provision in Article 5, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the appraisal method legal?

(4) Since you are going to conduct a physician examination, why exempt half or all of them? Isn't this an internal contradiction? Why isn't the fee for those who fail refunded?

Physician is a noble and sacred free profession, and it also holds the power of life and death in the world. The government should conduct a thorough reorganization of this. We know that the flexible certification method of the eighteenth year and this year's appraisal method can be said to be a stain on our history, and can also represent the failure of our past education.

"Incompetent doctors kill people" should naturally be banned. We also do not want a few bad apples to damage the reputation of the entire medical community by being called incompetent doctors. However, let us think about how these so-called incompetent doctors came into being. Therefore, the meaning of the government holding this appraisal, I think, is naturally nothing more than wanting to adjust the current social medical system, but we hope that in the adjustment, do not forget the objective environment and conditions! Otherwise, it will once again lead to wasting money and manpower.

Medical construction is not a slogan, but a practical task. How many poor and sick compatriots are waiting for us to do the work we should do, how great is the responsibility we should bear on our shoulders, but currently some senior health officials are too unaware of their position and the responsibility they should bear.

In the past, there were many errors in the path taken by the social medical system. The leaders of health work only aimed at seeking personal and their own faction's way out, forgetting to seek health for the majority of poor and sick people. Therefore, medical construction is a slogan, and the public feels discouraged and disappointed. If the health sector's vision does not pay attention to the grassroots work of society and the health of the general public in the future, I dare say that China's medical construction movement cannot be said to be successful! The medical construction undertaking is not a slogan, but a very arduous task. Now the time to success is still so far away. If we do it bit by bit, if we take the health and welfare of the public as the starting point, and if it is not a slogan, I firmly believe that success is inevitable.

### Developing Medicine and Pharmacy to Make Chinese People Recognize New Medicine (Part 2)

— Xia Chengdao

The old doctors say "Western medicine is good at surgery, and Chinese medicine is good at internal medicine," which is even more nonsense. Surgical diseases, in addition to systemic symptoms (such as fever, headache, dizziness, etc.), must have one place where there is redness and swelling, or erosion, or suppuration and bleeding, or deformation and muscle damage. The new medicine calls this local symptoms. The same is true for internal medicine, there must also be one place where there is suppuration and bleeding, or deformation and muscle damage, and then systemic diseases will arise accordingly. Among all diseases, brain hemorrhage, chest and kidney pain have ulcers, liver cirrhosis must have hydrops, heart valve defects cause edema, cavities in tuberculosis lungs are often like rock crevices, and typhoid intestinal ulcers may even rupture. What is presented externally must be what changes internally. This is verified by pathological anatomy and tested on thousands of people, and there is nothing wrong with it. From this point of view, the symptoms of internal and surgical diseases are the same. The only difference is that those inside are difficult to see, and the old doctors deceive themselves and others, and use words like liver hyperactivity, yin deficiency, phlegm accumulation, and rheumatism to muddle through. Those on the outside are visible to everyone, and the old doctors cannot deceive people with muddling through, and they do not understand surgery, so they say "this disease belongs to surgery, which is not their forte." Then, doesn't the new medicine excel only in surgery? Even internal medicine, dermatology, venereology, gynecology, obstetrics, pediatrics, ophthalmology, dentistry, otolaryngology, etc., each has its own special equipment, each has specialized doctors, and each department is the forte of new medicine. However, some unofficial doctors who were born as nurses in missionary hospitals only understand a few Western medicines, just like old doctors know the uses of Chinese medicine, suffering from the same problem of knowing what it is but not knowing why it is. For example, Christians scold those who worship ghosts and gods as superstitious, but aren't Christians also superstitious in worshiping Jesus God? Using superstition to scold superstition is really like a fox laughing at a cat!

Old doctors have never studied botany, zoology, physics, chemistry, physiology, etc. They do not understand the functions of various human organs, do not know the structure and properties of daily food, so they forbid patients from eating meat, and even the world-recognized nourishing foods for patients, such as eggs and milk, are not allowed to be eaten. Instead, they order patients to eat radishes, pickled mustard greens, and other indigestible things. Patients already have a poor appetite, and eating these things cannot improve their appetite. The more they eat, the less they can swallow at three meals. If they are bedridden for a long time, due to lack of nourishing plants, the body becomes emaciated. Not only can the physical strength and spirit consumed during the illness not be quickly restored, but many are also equivalent to starving to death. The old doctors' lack of reason and harming patients can be said to be extreme. New medicine has special nutritional therapies for patients' diets, which also occupy a very important part of the treatment. It has thorough theories, rich practical experience, specially made nourishing foods, and special equipment, all to help patients quickly restore their healthy physical strength and spirit. Generally, fresh foods that are rich in nutrients and easy to digest are suitable for patients' health preservation, but there are also exceptions, such as people with diabetes cannot eat sugar, and people with mental illness cannot eat stimulating things, etc. The old doctors often order patients to eat vegetarian food, saying that meat produces wind, dampness, phlegm, etc., which is as absurd and nonsensical as delirium!

What is even more painful is that the general villagers say that Chinese medicine says "After eating Western medicine, Chinese medicine will be ineffective in the future," so that the general ignorant people regard Western medicine as taking poison and dare not try it. Both Chinese and Western medicines come from animal, plant, and mineral sources, and there is only a distinction between refined and crude. How could such a strange thing happen? Perhaps they can blame the new medicine when Chinese medicine is ineffective in the future and muddle through their responsibility! Even the educated class in the countryside cannot avoid this, deeply poisoned by the old doctors. It can be seen that the old doctors try to confuse the public, reverse right and wrong, prevent the development of new medicine, prevent it from occupying their territory, and rob them of their rice bowls. Their intentions can be said to be meticulous! These old doctors are just like those blind fortune tellers who have lost their conscience and say that fortunes can not be told, fate cannot be calculated, but food cannot not be eaten. What difference is there? However, this is a social and livelihood problem that should be remedied and resolved by the state. It must not hinder the progress of the country and harm the lives of most people in order to preserve the rice bowls of a few people.

Chinese people must recognize and distinguish right from wrong. We are not as despicable as the old doctors, opposing the old doctors in order to rob them of their rice bowls. Our starting point is world science, and our work is to correct the erroneous theories of the old doctors. Our goal is to promote national progress, seek the happiness of the people's livelihood, and protect the safety and health of people's lives!

However, there are some selfish and profit-seeking merchants who promote the old doctors in the name of promotion and oppose the new doctors. Where have they ever opened their eyes and seen that Korean ginseng, etc., are also transported into our country's gates by foreign freighters?

Finally, developing medicine and pharmacy requires studying domestic drugs, refining them with scientific methods, and using them for treatment. Developing national essence, contributing to the world, and showing the glory of the country require the government to exert efforts to promote science, revitalize industry, open factories, and hire experts in various fields and subjects at home and abroad to preside over it. Manufacturing medical supplies and equipment ourselves to meet the needs of the people is the fundamental way to stop leaks!

### Preconditions for Promoting Rural Health Undertakings

— Yi Dan

Before we talk about the various issues of rural health, it is best to first understand the relationship between public health and the revival of the country and nation, and then talk about the importance of the status of rural health administrative measures and how to promote them smoothly in the future?

I remember that Japanese health professor Dr. Tsunekawa once said: "The prosperity, strength, and constancy of a nation depend on the quality of public health." Indeed, everyone knows this, everyone can say it, and in fact it is inevitable. According to Swedish statistician Sundbärg: "The death rate is the best method to measure the degree of civilization and effectiveness: If we compare the records of death rates in two countries or two places over many years, we can immediately judge the degree of their civilization development." Originally, the length of life increases with the progress of hygiene science and preventive medicine. Let's examine the supporting facts: According to recent surveys, the average life expectancy of Indians is 25 years, the average for people in Massachusetts, USA is 45 years, and the average for Swedes is 50 years. As for whether the health undertakings in these three countries are developed or not? The difference in the level of reality shown by their life extension rate and the level of health undertakings can be silently known. Furthermore, it can be seen that the length of life is always controlled by the artificial power of public health. On the other hand, the purpose of public health is to protect the health of the national physique and serve as the basis for spiritual and material development. Because only with a healthy people can a healthy society be formed, and only with a healthy society can a healthy country be formed; there has never been a nation that is weak and a society that is morbid that can establish a magnificent country in the world!

According to the above points, the importance of public health has been frankly displayed. Therefore, the implementation of public health occupies an important position of factual urgency in any country. However, the implementation of public health in our country is especially important because our country is based on agriculture, and the rural population accounts for more than 85% of the total population of the country: The unhealthiness of farmers is therefore the unhealthiness of the entire nation, and the unhealthiness of the nation is the key to the survival of the country, to put it bluntly, it is a precursor to the destruction of the country and the nation, so although public health is important, rural public health is even more important.

But what about our country now? The entire countryside can be said to be in ruins. The lives of farmers are ravaged by natural disasters and man-made disasters every day. Now they are almost on the last road to death, and the rural problem has also evolved into an extremely serious problem. Under this circumstance, we can often hear a very modern slogan—Go to the countryside and revive the countryside. At the same time, our government also has the organization of the Rural Revival Committee specializing in this matter, and its eyes are also cast on the countryside in terms of health improvement and facilities. As for its achievements, there are facts, and it is not within the scope of this article. Of course, the above is the fact that has clearly told us that China's current rural health occupies great importance, which is to say: Promoting rural health is tantamount to saving the life of China, which is on its last breath. Because the public deeply knows that rural health is important in China and is a reviving medicine for China: Therefore, those who bear the mission of promoting rural health are working hard and are also looking forward to reaching the so-called ideological destination—a rural area that can evolve with the trend of the times—however, under the circumstances of this nascent undertaking, we want to ensure that there are no obstacles in the process of promoting rural health and that we can realize our hopes. From a personal perspective, we should at least solve the following problems:

(1) Engage in active publicity

We know that if we want to implement the various hygiene methods that we consider necessary to implement for farmers, and also make them happy to follow them: This work is indeed not an easy task! First, farmers have immature knowledge: Second, the shadow of superstition is deeply rooted in their minds. With these two factors, farmers have absolutely no possibility of accepting health knowledge. Then, since there is no health knowledge, of course, they cannot understand the good or bad of hygiene and new medicine. Of course, they do not know how to improve the places that hinder hygiene. Therefore, the mutual invasion of diseases is naturally an unavoidable thing. But at the same time, they have to seek survival and have to make another attempt, so they still follow the remaining poison of superstition to do some self-destructive things such as alchemy, swallowing talismans, seeking gods, and worshiping Buddha. But occasionally they will respond to their demands—this demand is not really a gift from the gods, but actually the secret blessing of the natural resistance in their body, but there is no way to be aware of it!—This cannot but be said to be a kind of invisible mental and psychological treatment. Of course, the reason for their belief is based on the effect of this point. In fact, it is precisely the factor that causes their failure, because they never have the instinct to improve, and only hold on to the little grace obtained by superstitious luck, which is definitely not enough to guarantee life. However, people are ultimately rational, and besides, their only goal is still to seek the same line of survival! Therefore, if we want to make today's farmers in our country know the true essence of hygiene, we must at least make them know where the benefits and harms lie, and even more know the skin-cutting relationship between quack doctors, superstitious traditional concepts, etc. that kill people without using knives. This has to take some effort to move their tongues and engage in active hygiene publicity.

(2) Must cooperate with local gentry

If we run to a remote rural area where people are unfamiliar, it is absolutely not easy to see the corresponding situation and effect when we speak. Because in such places, all the farmers do not know us, so they cannot know whether we are good people or bad people. Therefore, no matter how much we make the hygiene methods that should be given to them sound flowery, or shout until our throats are hoarse, in the end no one will pay attention to you, and they may even suspect that we are the ghosts who are trying to harm them. To avoid this malpractice, the only way is to contact the local gentry, cooperate with them, join hands, and jointly seek promotion, which can have significant results. Because they are like the leaders there, the masses of farmers believe in them and obey them. They can intervene in the major and minor events that occur in the rural area, and they can influence the masses of farmers. Therefore, we should adopt this approach, try to cooperate with the local gentry, so that they can follow us. Once this step is put into practice, it is no different from the masses of farmers following us. In this way, we can save a lot of trouble, and we can obtain satisfactory results in simplicity. At the same time, our work should be integrated with the farmers. Then, implementing cooperation with the local gentry is the advanced manifestation of forming a united front with the farmers.

### Common Sense of Hygiene for Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases

— Tang Renjin

(119) What is Glaucoma?

Our eyeballs can maintain a certain tension and hardness, which is caused by the elasticity of the eyeball wall and the pressure of the fluid in the eyeball cavity. This situation is medically called intraocular pressure. If the intraocular pressure suddenly experiences pathological hyperactivity, the disease will immediately appear. The pupil will also appear slightly green, and the eyeball will become as hard as a stone. If intraocular pressure hyperactivity persists for a long time, it can cause atrophy of important organs and tissues in the eye, leading to blindness. This eye disease is specifically called glaucoma. It has also been recorded in Chinese medicine ophthalmology books for a long time. The so-called thunder headache, lateral headache, five-wind change, green wind, black wind, green wind, and black wind, etc., generally refer to glaucoma. Glaucoma has primary and secondary categories. Primary glaucoma refers to diseases that occur without other eye diseases. Secondary glaucoma is caused by iritis or other eye diseases. Primary glaucoma can be further divided into two categories. Those with eye redness, headache, and other stimulating symptoms are called inflammatory glaucoma. Those without stimulating symptoms are called simple glaucoma.

Here, I plan to briefly describe inflammatory glaucoma.

Inflammatory glaucoma has acute and chronic distinctions due to the speed of its progression. Its cause is still unknown. It mostly occurs in elderly people over 40 years old. It is especially prone to occur in those who are neurotic and mentally overworked. Its progression can be roughly divided into four stages, namely:

(1) Prodromal stage—the patient feels blurred vision. When looking at lights at night, colorful halos often appear around them. Swelling and diffuse cloudiness occur on the surface of the cornea. The pupil is slightly dilated and reacts slowly. Intraocular pressure rises. These symptoms can disappear after a few hours and return to normal. However, it recurs after a few days. After repeated attacks like this, it enters the outbreak stage.

(2) Outbreak stage glaucoma—the patient complains of severe headaches and feels loss of appetite, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, etc. Vision is also highly reduced. The cornea is swollen and cloudy. The eyelids are also swollen, the pupils are dilated, and the reaction disappears. Intraocular pressure is very high, so that the eyeball is as hard as a stone, which can be felt from the outside of the eyelid. The pupil appears green, so this disease is specifically called glaucoma. Sometimes the symptoms of this disease are severe, and blindness can occur soon, which is called electric shock glaucoma.

(3) Complete glaucoma—various organs in the eye are completely degenerated and atrophied. At this time, most patients are blind. The cornea is diffusely cloudy. The iris is atrophied and discolored. The pupils are dilated and the reaction disappears. Intraocular pressure is particularly increased. When examining the fundus of the eye, optic disc cupping can often be observed.

(4) Degenerative glaucoma—is the final stage of glaucoma. Corneal sensation is lost. Large bullous keratitis or band-shaped opacity occurs. The iris is atrophied. Eye pain and headache. As a result, the eyeball also comes to atrophy. Intraocular pressure is also reduced.

The symptoms of glaucoma are so complicated, and its danger is so obvious, so we must not underestimate this disease. If you encounter vision impairment, dilated pupils (except when using mydriatic drugs), increased intraocular pressure, and headaches, you should immediately visit a specialist doctor, which is the best policy.

(120) Optic Neuritis

There are many causes of optic neuritis, such as (1) syphilis, (2) acute infectious diseases (most commonly colds), (3) nephritis, (4) tuberculosis, (5) lead poisoning, (6) meningitis, and (7) trauma, etc. The disease often occurs in conjunction with retinitis, which is called optic neuroretinitis. The subjective symptoms of patients with this disease are decreased vision and narrowed visual field. If a fundus examination is performed, the optic disc papilla is seen to be red and raised. Its boundaries are also unclear. The veins of the retina are often dilated, and the arteries are thin.

The prognosis of optic neuritis is often good, but sometimes it can also lead to optic atrophy. The treatment plan should first explore the cause of the disease and add treatment, which is essential.

### Relief for Declining Fisheries: Fishery Syndicate Established Yesterday

Qian Xinzh reports, Vice Minister Zhou delivers instructions,
Election of Standing Directors and Manager

The Ministry of Industries' Fishery Syndicate was established yesterday. The office is located on the fourth floor of the Xinhua Bank on Jiangxi Road. The national flag and the Kuomintang flag are prominently displayed at the entrance. The first board meeting of the syndicate was held at 11:00 AM. All directors attended. Zhou Yichun, the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Industries, attended and gave instructions. Standing directors were elected and various regulations were passed. The details are recorded below:

Directors Attending

All nineteen directors of the syndicate were present, including official directors Yu Zhenyong, Qian Xinzhi, Gui Yanfang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Yuanshan, Zhang Yichou; directors representing various banks Cheng Muhao, Cao Jiru, Dong Chengdao, Sun Renjing, Zhou Desun, Yang Peiyuan, Wang Shaoxian, Chen Chuanghan, Xu Maotang, Ye Fuxiao, Wang Zhidi, Jin Shangqi; and Zhou Yichun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industries; Supervisor Yan Shenyu, etc. Qian Xinzhi was publicly elected as chairman, Hua Wenyu as recorder. The meeting agenda: A. Formalities, B. Chairman's opening remarks, C. Minister's address, D. Reporting matters, E. Discussion items.

Chairman Qian's Speech

After the meeting began, Chairman Qian Xinzhi delivered the opening remarks, stating, "The Ministry of Industries' Fishery Syndicate is established today. I am very grateful for the participation of all directors and the guidance of Vice Minister Zhou. Last year, the Ministry of Industries, recognizing the decline of our country's fisheries, felt the necessity for relief. Therefore, it united with the banking sector to organize the syndicate, to handle loans. The ministry allocated 200,000 yuan, and various banks subscribed 800,000 yuan. A preparatory office was established to carry out the organization. Today it is established, which will provide significant convenience to fishermen. However, there are no sound organizations in fishing villages, so the loan targets are difficult to determine. After investigation by the preparatory office, the situation in various places has been clarified. In the future, we can assist fishermen in various places to establish cooperatives to facilitate loans. The preparatory office has a simple organization, saves expenses, and the Xinhua Bank has also provided a lot of assistance. I hereby submit this report and express my gratitude."

Vice Minister Zhou's Instructions

Vice Minister Zhou Yichun delivered instructions, saying, "On behalf of Minister Wu, I participate in this grand gathering, and would like to report two points: ① In the past, the general society was very unfamiliar with rural areas. Since the financial sector went to investigate, it has gradually gained understanding, and after the pilot rural loans achieved results, the loans have now expanded from small to large, benefiting rural areas greatly. In the future, the Fishery Syndicate is also expected to make concrete contacts with fishermen, following the precedent of rural loans, gradually expanding loans to become a permanent financial institution to improve the lives of fishermen. ② The syndicate's business must strictly adhere to commercial principles and not hold the idea of relief, so that fishermen and the financial sector establish an equal relationship, and the syndicate serves as a communication mechanism, then the syndicate can be successful."

Preparatory Process

Preparatory member Wang Zhixin reported on the preparatory process, stating, "The syndicate was initiated by the Ministry of Industries and supported by twelve banks including the Bank of China, which jointly organized and established the preparatory office. Five meetings were held successively from November 7th of last year. At the first meeting, each bank's subscription was determined: Bank of China, 120,000 yuan; Bank of Communications, 100,000 yuan; Shanghai, Zhejiang Xingye, Four Banks, Jincheng, Jiaye, Zhongnan, Zhonghui, Dalu, Xinhua, 60,000 yuan each; Siming, 40,000 yuan. As for the syndicate's articles of association, loan regulations, etc., the draft was also passed by various meetings and submitted to the Ministry of Industries for record. The preparatory office also sent personnel to Shengsi, Zhoushan, Sheshan Mouth, etc., for investigation, which has come to an end. Future investigations will continue in various places. Also, Four Banks, Xinhua, Zhonghui, three banks, in order to meet the urgent needs of fishermen, first allocated 120,000 yuan for loans, and now several tens of thousands of yuan have been recovered, which will be transferred to the syndicate for handling. " Finally, the list of directors was read out.

### The First Special District Court Sentences Liu Luyin to be Escorted to Hubei for Trial Yesterday

The Hubei High Court Sends Personnel by Plane to Shanghai to Pick Up and Escort Him, Liu Requests Bail, Which is Denied by the Judge

According to the Central News Agency, after the assassins in the assassination cases of Tang Youren, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Yang Yongtai, Chairman of Hubei Province, confessed that Liu Luyin instigated them, Liu was arrested at 1:30 AM on the 24th of last month. The public has repeatedly reported on this in previous newspapers. The case was opened for trial at 10 AM on the 1st in the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Hubei Higher Court sent personnel to Shanghai to request the First Special District Court to transfer the case. Judge Feng Shide sentenced Liu Luyin to be handed over to the personnel of the Hubei High Court to be escorted back to Hubei for handling. The details are as follows:

Full House in the Gallery

At 8:45 AM yesterday morning, Liu was escorted from the Chengdu Road Police Station to the First Special District Court. Liu's wife, brothers, and others were all in court. Liu was wearing a gray silk shirt, his hair was combed back, and there was a hint of gray. He waited quietly in the First Criminal Court for the trial to begin. Before the trial of Liu's case, Liu sat quietly listening to the theft case, and from time to time talked with his lawyer, behaving as usual. The gallery was declared full.

Hubei High Court Requests Transfer

Later, at 10:50 AM, Liu's case was opened for trial, still presided over by Judge Feng Shide. In addition to the originally hired lawyer Wang Shou'an, Liu also hired Shan Yuhua and He Xiaoyuan as defense lawyers. Zhan Jifeng, legal counsel of the Municipal Police Department, appeared in court. First, the police station's lawyer Ru Baoyi declared that the Hubei Higher Court would send representatives to Shanghai, and it was expected that they would arrive around 11 AM. He requested that the trial be changed to 2 PM in the afternoon. Subsequently, Zhan Jifeng, legal counsel of the Police Department, said that the court and the bureau had received official documents from the Hubei Higher Court, and all procedures were legal. He requested that the trial be conducted immediately, and the official documents were submitted. At that time, Judge Feng also stated that the court had received a telegram from Chen Shizeng, the chief prosecutor of the Hubei Higher Court. At the same time, it was heard that the municipal government had also received a telegram. Liu himself and his defense lawyers requested to read the telegram, which stated that Liu was related to the assassination of Yang Yongtai and that the case was serious. It requested that he be transferred back to Hubei for trial. Liu's defense lawyer Shan Yuhua stood up to defend.

Liu States his Case and Requests Bail

At that time, Zhang Fusen, a member of the Hubei Higher Court, carrying official documents, hurried to the court. Judge Feng inquired briefly and then said that if an agency other than the court arrested a criminal, the court would have to investigate the evidence before approving the transfer. Now that the Hubei Higher Court has issued a document requesting the transfer, since both belong to the judicial authorities, as long as the suspect is correctly identified, the case should of course be transferred in accordance with the law. Liu's lawyer requested bail before the transfer. Lawyer Zhan Jifeng said that since there are official documents, everything is legal, and the court should approve the immediate transfer. Liu Luyin then stated to the court that he should be investigated in more detail after his arrest, otherwise his spirit, material wealth, and reputation would be damaged. Moreover, he could not easily escape, and he requested bail before the transfer.

Writes Judgment and Orders Transfer

Subsequently, Liu's representative lawyer made a further statement. Finally, Liu said that if bail was not granted, he would declare that he entrusted his representative lawyer to file an appeal. Judge Feng said that the court could not refuse the transfer and that the appeal could not stop the execution. He immediately wrote the judgment that Liu Luyin would be handed over to the personnel of the Hubei Higher Court to be escorted back to Hubei for trial, and that the Shanghai Municipal Police Department would assist in the escort. He then declared the court adjourned.

Escorted to the Police Station, Soon to be Escorted to Hubei

After the court adjourned, Liu went to the police station lawyer's lounge with his family and defense lawyers and drank a cup of tea. He then took a police patrol car to the Chengdu Road Police Station. The Municipal Police Department also sent personnel to accompany him. After the personnel from the Hubei Higher Court completed the transfer procedures, Liu was escorted to the police station around 12 PM. It is reported that the police station treated Liu very well, and in the afternoon, it was decided to hand him over to the Procuratorate of the Hubei Higher Court for handling.

Main Points of the Document Requesting Transfer

The main points of the official document requesting transfer from the Hubei Higher Court stated that in the case of the assassination of Yang Yongtai, the former Chairman of Hubei Province, the murderers Cheng Xiechao and Gong Baizhou confessed that Liu Luyin instigated them. Liu had organized reactionary groups such as the "Revolutionary Corps" and the "Chinese Youth Special Task Force" and deployed party members in various places to engage in assassination work. Therefore, it requested the transfer of the case for trial.

### Grain Transportation Bureau Announces Drop in Rice Prices in Guangdong

Due to Minister Kong's Earnest Efforts to Provide Relief, Twelve Market Jin Can Be Purchased per Yuan

The Grain Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance announced yesterday that according to a report from the bureau's investigators stationed in Guangdong, the arrival of rice and grain in Guangzhou has recently been quite abundant, and market prices have fallen sharply. Guangdong-produced Simiao rice is 14 yuan, Qimei is 13.7 to 13.9 yuan, Hunan Zhuzhou oil rice is 11.6 yuan, Hengzhou Pu rice is 10.05 yuan, Wuhu Jiaxing Yu rice is 11.4 yuan, Jiangxi Pu rice is 11 to 12 yuan. According to Zheng Baozhao, director of the bureau, Guangzhou's rice prices, according to a report from the bureau's investigators stationed in Guangdong, have fallen by an average of 8 jiao to 1 yuan per dan compared to the highest price in mid-January, and are 4 jiao lower than when I left Guangdong last month, which is also 1 jiao lower than the price of rough rice sold by the Guangdong Provincial People's Food Adjustment Committee. About twelve market jin can be purchased per yuan. Currently, the People's Food Adjustment Committee has more than 200,000 dan of rice in storage, which can be released for sale at any time to suppress the rising market prices. Therefore, the central government and Minister Kong's concern for relief has alleviated the panic and greatly inspired the people of Guangdong.

The notices and announcements are as follows: ㊀ Notice: We are writing to inform you that according to Article 2, Paragraph 3, Item Ren, of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, foundation deposits of educational and charitable organizations or groups, and Item Mao of the same article, annual interest income from educational savings that does not exceed 100 yuan, are legally exempt from income tax. However, according to the announcement of the Income Tax Affairs Office, it is stipulated that for the above two types of deposits, the depositing institution should, upon receiving the deposit, report to the competent collection authority for verification based on the depositor's application. For those deposited before January 1, 1937, or not in the name of the organization or group, the deadline for supplementary reporting or correction is the end of March of this year. Those who do not supplement or correct will be treated as ordinary deposits. The application form for tax exemption has been prepared and sent by the Shanghai Income Tax Office. At the same time, in order to make it clear to depositors, this association, together with the Money Trade Association, will publish another announcement in the newspaper. We are now notifying you separately and enclosing 100 copies each of the two types of application forms. We hope you will receive them and handle them accordingly.

### Four Guangdong Associations in Shanghai Hosted a Banquet for Yu Hanmou and Others Yesterday

More than 300 Attendees; Very Lively at the New Asia Hotel

The Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, Guangzhao Guild Hall, Cantonese Overseas Chinese Business Federation, and Chaozhou Guild Hall, four organizations, held a banquet at the grand ballroom of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road at 6:00 PM yesterday (1st) to welcome Yu Hanmou and other Cantonese members of the Central Committee. Attendees included Yu Hanmou, Li Xuhuan, Liu Weichi, Deng Gang, Yu Junxian, Wu Tiecheng, Tang Haian, Wen Zongyao, Cai Jinjun, Li Dachao, and others, totaling over 300 people. First, Chairman Wen Zongyao delivered a welcome speech, roughly stating that today, the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, Guangzhao Guild Hall, Chaozhou Guild Hall, and Cantonese Overseas Chinese Business Federation, four organizations, as well as fellow villagers in the city of Shanghai,

Jointly Welcome

Mr. Yu Woqi, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army and Director of the Guangdong Pacification Headquarters, as well as the esteemed members of the Central Committee from our hometown. We are honored that you have deigned to attend. Fellow countrymen have long been away from home, and the longer we are away, the stronger our love for our hometown becomes. Commander-in-Chief Yu, as a Cantonese, bears the responsibility of the highest leader of our Guangdong. His contributions to the military and political facilities of Guangdong Province are obvious to all. The esteemed members of the Central Committee are all pillars of our country and accomplished fellow countrymen, whom we all admire. Taking advantage of your attendance at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee,

Passing Through Shanghai

We have gathered this meeting to sincerely express our welcome. Although the arrangements and format may be simple, the intention is sincere and genuine. On the one hand, we want to fulfill our duty as hosts, on the other hand, to strengthen our connections, and on the other hand, to admire your demeanor, and on the other hand, to hope that you can tell us about the recent situation in Guangdong or important party and government news to comfort our fellow countrymen. Zongyao and others, on behalf of our fellow countrymen, raise a glass to Commander-in-Chief Yu, the esteemed members of the Central Committee, and all the gentlemen, wishing you health and inviting you to drink together. Then, Commander-in-Chief Yu gave a speech, roughly saying that he was very happy to be able to gather with fellow countrymen tonight, drinking and talking. Guangdong has been in a

Special Situation

For several years. The outside world is inevitably isolated. But since July of last year, this situation has been completely eliminated. Regarding the recent situation in Guangdong, I will take this opportunity to give a brief report to my fellow countrymen. First, in the political aspect, Guangdong has now implemented military-civilian separation, and local security is also becoming increasingly peaceful. Those of us responsible for military and political affairs will continue to move forward with a spirit of impartiality and the common goal of not competing with the people for profit. Second, in terms of construction, all construction in Guangdong is still far from meeting the conditions of a model province. One reason is the lack of manpower and financial resources, and the other is the various impacts of the global recession, which has led to the decline of industry and commerce and the gradual depression of rural areas. If we want to make Guangdong a model province, it is essential to have a large amount of

Manpower and Financial Resources

Cannot be helped. Taking food alone, in the past, the measurement of Guangdong rice was affected by political factors, and there was almost no profit to be made from planting by the people. Barren fields were all over the province, and Guangdong's reliance on foreign rice increased day by day, while Guangdong's finances flowed outward day by day. Now, the grain problem is difficult to get help from the central government, but this is a stopgap measure. The fundamental solution is to continue to work towards self-sufficiency in order to solve it thoroughly. All other construction is

Being Planned

In the process, I hope that my fellow countrymen will fulfill a responsibility for their hometown and an obligation for the country, and give timely guidance and assistance to the local authorities of this province. Tonight, with this glass of wine, I wish all my fellow countrymen good health. Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech, roughly saying that during the tense situation in Guangdong and Guangxi in July last year, the whole country was anxious, but thanks to Mr. Yu Woqi upholding justice, the crisis was turned into safety and the danger was turned into ease, and the national peace and unity was completed. As for the problems urgently to be solved in Guangdong, the first is the grain problem. Guangdong's grain has always relied on the supply of Annam and Siam, and every year

Financial Outflow

Amounts to 70 to 80 million yuan, so the food problem cannot be solved, and all problems in Guangdong cannot be solved. He said that this problem cannot be solved in a short period of time or by the efforts of a few people. It must be done with the cooperation of the whole province and the central government. The second is the financial problem. In the past, one yuan of Guangdong currency could be exchanged for one yuan and two jiao of silver dollars. Now, due to the depreciation of Guangdong currency, one yuan and five jiao of Guangdong currency can only be exchanged for one yuan of silver dollars. Guangdong is a province with an excess of imports, and the daily necessities of 30 million Cantonese people depend on foreign supply, so prices have risen and people's lives are becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the problem of currency value is also an urgent problem to be solved. If the above two questions can be

Solved

Then it is possible to build a new Guangdong. We believe that the current local authorities of Guangdong Province will certainly work hard to seek happiness for their hometown and welfare for the country. As for the public welfare undertakings of Cantonese people in Shanghai, such as schools and hospitals, we also hope that the local authorities of this province will give encouragement and assistance from time to time. Afterwards, speakers included Director Liu Weichi and others. It was not until after 8 o'clock that everyone dispersed happily. Mayor Wu also scheduled a banquet at the International Hotel at 12:30 noon today to bid farewell to Mr. Yu and introduce him to leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai. Mr. Yu was originally scheduled to return to the south on the Makinlan Presidential ship of the Da Lai Company tomorrow, but because the ship encountered fog on the way, it will not be able to arrive in Shanghai until the 4th and set sail for Hong Kong on the 5th, so Mr. Yu's itinerary will also be delayed.

### The Nanhsing Steamer Encountered a Storm on the Way

The Propeller Wing Was Knocked Off, and the Oil Tank Was Damaged; Now It Is Going to Xiutu for Repairs Before Continuing Its Voyage

The Nanhsing steamer of the Nanhsing Shipping Company at 26 Yong'an Street, French Concession, which specializes in running the Shanghai to Xinghua Quanzhou route in Fujian, mainly transports goods. This time, it loaded a large batch of groceries from Shanghai and set off for Quanzhou. On the way, the ship encountered a storm on the sea. The turbulent waves hit the hull very badly, causing an extremely dangerous voyage. The engine wing of the stern rudder was actually knocked off by the big waves and sank into the sea. The oil tank of the ship was also broken by the strong wind and waves, and even the deck was damaged. Fortunately, it struggled hard and was able to escape this dangerous situation. However, with the engine wing knocked off, the ship had lost its ability to navigate and could not sail. The damage to the oil tank and other places also urgently needed to be repaired. It was immediately forced to sail to Xiutu to dock, and urgently telegraphed Ningbo, ordering Huichang Machinery Factory to rush to make two copper engine wings for application, and also used cement to fill the damaged parts in order to open to Quanzhou. The situation of the accident has been reported to Shanghai by telegram yesterday. As for the details and the extent of the damage, etc., it is necessary to wait for the ship to come to Shanghai, send a ship surveyor for inspection, and at the same time, the captain will submit a detailed report of the accident before everything can be clearly known.

### Owners of Houses in Areas with Roads Built Across Borders Oppose the Municipal Council's Collection of Donations

According to the Central News Agency, regarding the issue of house donations in areas with roads built across borders, the owners of houses in the area have risen up in opposition due to the forced collection by the Public Concession Municipal Council. However, this matter concerns China's sovereignty, so the reporter has learned about the situation from all parties concerned as follows:

Water and Electricity Issues

The case of the recovery of roads built across borders was repeatedly negotiated by the municipal government of this city and the authorities of the Public Concession, but a thorough solution could not be obtained due to various reasons. The municipal government of this city, considering the matter related to sovereignty, dispatched posts in the area by the municipal police bureau to protect security and maintain order. Regarding the issue of water and electricity supply in the area, a considerable solution has also been reached. In the area along North Sichuan Road with roads built across borders, most of the water and electricity has been supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. In the Hongqiao area, the supply of electricity is handled by the Shanghai West Electricity Company, which was approved by the municipal government to establish. The water supply issue has also been properly resolved by the municipal government.

Tax Payment Situation

According to the above situation, all house donations in the area should be collected by the municipal government of this city. House donations in the North Sichuan Road area have been completely collected by the municipal finance bureau. The municipal finance bureau has also sent personnel to collect house donations in the Hongqiao area. Some of the owners have paid the house donations to the municipal government, but some have not yet paid.

Owner Opposition

This time, the Public Concession intends to collect house donations from the owners in the area with roads built across borders. The owners have risen up in opposition. The municipal government will naturally strive for it. At the same time, it is hoped that the owners in the area with roads built across borders can abide by Chinese laws and regulations and pay the house donations to the tax collection office on their own.

### Representatives of the Shantytown Federation Petition for the Speedy Construction of Public Housing

The Municipal Council Should Not Break Its Promise and Set a Deadline for Demolishing Shanties

The Shantytown Federation of this city stated that the Municipal Council limited the demolition of all shantytowns in the areas of Dalian Bay Road, Yulin Road, Qiwupu Road, Pingliang Road, Lan Road, Yangshupu Road, and the intersection of Zhaofeng Road, Dalian Bay Road, and the boundary road of the concession in Pudong before May 1st of this year. This caused panic among the shantytowns in the area. Therefore, Tang Anping, Wang Qitai, Sun Hankui, Xu Xiguang, Wang Xinglin, Duan Yifu, and others were elected as representatives yesterday afternoon to petition the First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Taxpayer Chinese Association, Huadong Yu Qiaqing, and the Municipal Council, etc., to express their grievances and request exemption from demolition, and appealed for the realization of the construction of public housing to avoid homelessness. The association's petition to the Municipal Council is recorded as follows: The petition is for requesting exemption from demolishing shanties to maintain the residence of the poor and avoid homelessness, and to emphasize credit. Since early July of the 25th year of the Republic of China, this association has appealed to all parties to request exemption from demolition. The bureau replied that it would accept the suggestions of the Citizens' Federation, the Taxpayer Association, and the Huadong, and agreed to build public housing to accommodate the shantytowns. This association also voluntarily guaranteed that it would not increase or enlarge, implement chain protection, implement only maintaining existing survival, and gradually implement the reduction plan. It was reported to the bureau for record. In November of the 25th year, Mr. Habert, director of the engineering department, led the representatives of this association to the model room and pointed out the design of public housing. On December 10th, the bureau issued a repair scope letter in view of the misunderstanding in the repair of shantytowns, so as to avoid future disputes. It did not mention other issues. This association knows that the bureau is enthusiastic about society and cares about the suffering of the people. In order to seek joint responsibility, it divides ten households into a group, and ten groups set up a supervisor to supervise on the spot. Recently, 447 groups have been completed, 169 groups are west of Lan Road, and the rest are east of Lan Road. Before the issuance of the repair scope letter, those who reported and forwarded it to the engineering department for approval, a total of 576 households. It has been seven months since now. Not only has the shantytown not been added at all, but on the contrary, the landlords' buildings and other accidents have been demolished by the engineering department by no less than 100 households. The above events are not our exaggeration. I still ask you to inspect it on the spot. The bureau should also maintain the past and wait for the completion of public housing before proceeding is not too late. Recently, the bureau, disregarding the people's difficulties, suddenly issued demolition leaflets west of Lan Road in February of this year, setting a deadline for demolition before May 1st. The east of Lan Road said it would be July 1st. The poor people were panicked when they saw this sudden incident, and before the deadline arrived, the engineering department demolished ten households at the intersection of Jining Road and Qiqihar Road on February 19th. The shantytowns felt even more panicked and helpless. I think the bureau has a decree in front of it and cannot break its promise later. Before public housing has been implemented, it should understand the hardships of the poor. It is impossible to rectify the city appearance and lose credit. Therefore, this association especially begs the bureau to cherish the residence of the poor, withdraw its order, maintain humanity, and avoid the displacement of more than 26,000 people. Then this association is very fortunate, and the shantytowns are very fortunate.

### Wu Ke-ren and Others Pass Through Shanghai

According to the Central News Agency, Wu Ke-ren, commander of the 67th Army, and Li Zhentang, Huo Shouyi, Zhou Fucheng, Tang Junyao, division commanders, and Zhang Zhiheng, chief of staff of the 3rd Cavalry Division, and other six people, went to Ningbo on the 26th of last month to visit Mr. Zhang Xueliang to express their condolences. They returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou the day before yesterday, and took the night train to Beijing at 11:00 PM that night to visit Chairman Chiang on the 3rd for instructions. It is reported that during this visit to Ningbo, Mr. Zhang Xueliang repeatedly warned Wu and others to obey the central government.

### Military Delegation to Europe Led by Shangguan Yunxiang to Return

The Chinese military delegation to Europe, led by Shangguan Yunxiang and others, was dispatched abroad last year to inspect military equipment in various European countries for reference. It has been more than a year since then. It is now learned that Shangguan and others have completed their mission and have returned home on the Conte Verde of the Italian Shipping Company. It is scheduled to go to Guangdong after arriving in Shanghai, and will return to Beijing to report on their mission around the end of the month. Shangguan Yunxiang's wife and others will take a ship south from Shanghai on the 3rd to meet him.

### Mayor Wu Hosts Banquet for He Jian

Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet for Chairman He Jian of Hunan Province, Yin Renxian, the new director of the provincial finance department, Yu Chuanji, director of the construction department, Wang Ping, director of the finance department of Shanxi Province, and Li Hongwen, representative of Yan Xishan, at his private residence on Haig Road at 12:00 noon yesterday. The banquet dispersed at around 2:00 PM.

Now Gu Xueyuan has found that when the corpse was discovered at the West Gate Branch and reported to the local security for inspection, the corpse was no longer there when the local security went to see it.

After graduating last year, she was recommended by her Peide homeroom teacher, Zhu Guangtong, a native of Ningbo, to the Ning County Girls' Middle School to continue her studies. Due to their teacher-student relationship, Zhu frequently visited Yao at the Ning County Girls' Middle School. Unexpectedly, over time, the teacher-student relationship transformed into a romance. Like illicit affairs, they became inseparable, and the ill-fated relationship took root early. Yao's abdomen gradually swelled. Fearing that the secret would be discovered by her classmates and teachers, she had to drop out of school first. Not daring to face her elders in Jiangdong, she followed Zhu Guangtong to Shanghai like Hongfu's elopement, renting a house at No. 136 Jingfu Lane, Matteh Hess Road, in western Shanghai, as their cohabitation place.

### Shanghai Municipal Crematorium to Adopt Chinese Architectural Style

Diesel Fuel to Be Used, Currently in Design Stage, Site in Jiangwan, Budget of 60,000 Yuan, Construction Expected to Be Completed This Spring

Since the Shanghai Municipal Crematorium was initiated by Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and a preparatory committee was established, the following is a report on the recent progress:

Preparatory Meeting

Since the Shanghai Municipal Crematorium was initiated by the Municipal Government, Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Ye Yuhu, Guo Chengen, Heber, Wen Zongyao, Zhu Boquan, Jiang Yiping, Li Yuanxin, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Commissioner Wang Changchun, Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, Police Bureau Director Cai Jingjun, Public Works Bureau Director Shen Yi, Health Bureau Director Li Ting'an, and others were appointed to form a preparatory committee. Several preparatory meetings were convened, and the total construction budget was set at 60,000 yuan.

Budget Allocation

Regarding the allocation of construction funds, a reporter from the Ruentong News Agency learned from the preparatory committee that in addition to 20,000 yuan allocated by the Municipal Government and 10,000 yuan to be raised by Dr. Wu Liande, the remaining 30,000 yuan will be raised by Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, and other committee members from various charitable organizations and public offices that handle burials. The charitable organizations and public offices that donate will enjoy preferential treatment in the future, i.e., they can cremate unclaimed coffins free of charge.

Furnace Design

The Municipal Government has allocated 20 mu of land in Jiangwan for the crematorium site. The architectural style of the crematorium will adopt the Chinese architectural style. As for fuel, using gas would be too expensive and would violate the principle of economic efficiency. Therefore, diesel fuel was chosen. The furnace design is currently being designed by a German engineer. It is expected that three corpses can be cremated simultaneously in the furnace. The cost of diesel fuel required will only be 80 cents in national currency, and the cost per corpse will be less than 30 cents.

Completion This Spring

According to a survey conducted by the Municipal Health Bureau in 1929, there are as many as 100,000 floating coffins in Shanghai. The population of this city is extremely dense, and many good lands are occupied by these floating coffins. Therefore, it is extremely detrimental to society, economy, public health, and the appearance of the city. Therefore, the urgent need for cremation goes without saying. The preparatory committee is actively proceeding with the project, hoping to complete it this spring.

Accomplices of the Thief

Were hiding in room 44 on the 3rd floor of the Guang'an Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. The officer immediately reported to Captain Qian Daxiong, who led a team of detectives to make the arrests. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at room 44 on the 3rd floor of the Guang'an Hotel, the thief and a woman were sleeping, both naked. They were ordered to get dressed and five suitcases were seized.

### Daughter-in-Law Accuses Father-in-Law of Embezzlement

Mother's Family Ancestral Land, Father-in-Law Schemes to Transfer Ownership and Take It for Himself

Huang Changlin, a local resident of No. 253 Yangjiadu, Pudong, whose original home is in Liuhe, so he is also known as Liuhe Arer, is 64 years old this year. He was originally of humble origin, working as a boatman. Later, he suddenly had an opportunity and became a boat charterer running the docks. He has owned many large barges. More than ten years ago, he made a lot of money and was frugal. Therefore, he now has more than 100,000 assets and is one of the richest people in the rural area of Yangjiadu. The villagers elected him as

The local head of the village has become an old master. It is a pity that the younger generation cannot carry on the family business, which is a regret. Huang Changlin was once accused of abandonment by a woman several years ago and was involved in litigation all the way to the High Court before being declared innocent and settling with the woman. Therefore, in recent years, Huang has not been as actively involved in external affairs as before. Unexpectedly, recently his eldest daughter-in-law, Huang Shao (30 years old, has filed a criminal appeal in the local court against Huang Changlin for embezzling real estate. According to the main point of the complaint filed by her lawyer Liu Liang, the plaintiff has

Ancestral Land of Her Mother's Family, Located in Pudong 23rd District, 24th Bao, with a total area of 2 mu, 8 fen, 6 li, and 5 hao, the actual amount after assessment is 4 mu, in the name of Ding Shao. Because the plaintiff was a child bride at the age of six and married at the age of seventeen, the land deed has been kept with the father-in-law. Unexpectedly, the defendant has insidious intentions and intends to illegally own the property he holds for others. He secretly went to the Land Bureau to secretly transfer the ownership. Later, the plaintiff found out and demanded it back. The defendant, seeing that the plaintiff was a woman who could be deceived, ignored her and went to the Land Bureau to collect a new deed, thinking it would erase the facts. However, the Land Bureau also discovered

The Collusion and Fraud and temporarily suspended the issuance. Therefore, it is requested that Huang Changlin be punished for the crime of intending to illegally own property held by him for others, for himself or for a third party, in accordance with Article 335 of the Criminal Law, which is punishable by imprisonment of not more than five years, detention, or a fine of not more than 1,000 yuan. Huang Changlin also hired Senior Lawyer Xue Lisheng to defend him and file a counterclaim for false accusation. The main point is that the plaintiff is the wife of the eldest son, Jinfu. There are often disputes between the husband and wife. The parents-in-law are not in their eyes. They do not know how to follow morality, and also

Disregard Rank and Seniority. Abandoning the labor of women's work, they violate the responsibility of being a good wife, listening to slander and coming home to threaten. Since 1926, they have repeatedly been involved in litigation in civil and criminal courts and the prosecutor's office with her son Jinfu, more than five times, and have repeatedly lost the lawsuits. Therefore, she has unrealistic ideas and falsely accuses the father-in-law of embezzling real estate. However, her purpose is still to ask for a divorce from her son. This is completely fabricated out of thin air. Even if there is this land, there is a statute of limitations, and it cannot be requested back in civil law. Criminal Procedure Law 313

Direct Lineage, Ascendants

Or spouse, shall not bring a private prosecution. Therefore, it is requested that the case be dismissed and the crime of false accusation be punished. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing opened the court. Regarding the relationship between father-in-law and daughter-in-law, it is a direct lineage relative. The defendant's lawyer said that the direct case was a mistake, so the trial continued. The plaintiff's statement was roughly the same as the complaint, while the defendant Huang Changlin said that the land was bought from the Ding family. The official asked in whose name the account was at the Land Bureau. Huang said that Ding Jinfu came forward. The official said,

"Since you bought it, why didn't you use the Huang surname?" Huang replied that it would save a transfer fee, but when the four sons in the family are to divide the property in the future, they would change it back. The official said, "So, the fee will still be needed." The official also asked about Huang Changlin's family situation. Huang was unusually distressed and poor, claiming that he was not rich and only had a broken house to feed himself. The official then ordered Huang Changlin to pay a deposit of 2,000 yuan and to submit all the documents in his home for investigation. Because he did not have time to find a guarantor, lawyer Xue requested that he be released on bail first, and the bail bond would be added the next day.

### Chamber of Commerce Requests Amendments

First Category of Income Tax: Draft Collection Guidelines

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce continues to write to the Income Tax Office, requesting amendments to the draft collection guidelines for the third category [of income]. The letter states: "Respectfully, concerning the draft collection guidelines for income tax, regarding the first category, profit-seeking income, and the second category, salaries and compensation, the various items that should be modified, added, or deleted have already been detailed and communicated to your office by our chamber, requesting their adoption. Now, regarding the draft collection guidelines for the third category of income tax, we have continued our discussions and believe that there are also areas that should be modified, added, or deleted. We have compiled these opinions on a separate sheet and respectfully submit them to you, hoping that you will review and approve their adoption. Attached are the proposed modifications: ㊀ In the original draft, Article 3, Section 2, concerning interest from loans made by foreign firms, organizations, and individuals in the banking industry to companies and businesses, we propose to amend it to 'interest received by companies, businesses, firms, and factories on stored funds.' (Because the third category is originally for income from securities and deposits, the original draft's use of 'loans made' is fundamentally inconsistent with the regulations.) ㊁ In the original draft, Article 4, 'Loans from banks and money houses, and interbank or inter-branch transactions in the banking industry, the interest generated therefrom shall be included in the calculation of business income and shall not be subject to deposit interest income tax,' we propose to amend it to 'interest generated from loans made by banks and money houses shall be included in the calculation of business income and shall not be subject to deposit interest income tax.' ㊂ We propose to add two items under Article 4 in the original draft: ㊄ For profit-seeking businesses, whether companies, businesses, firms, factories, or individuals, with capital of two thousand or more, transactions with other companies, businesses, firms, factories, or individuals shall be handled in accordance with the preceding item. ㊅ Interest calculated on transactions between a main store and its branches shall be allowed to be offset against each other, but this does not apply to those whose income is determined by Article 6 of the Detailed Implementation Rules. The original draft, Article 5, under the sentence 'All funds belonging to educational and charitable institutions or organizations,' we propose to add 'or legal entities not for profit.' Also, 'by the deposit institution at the time of receiving the deposit,' we propose to amend it to 'and also notify the deposit institution at the time of receiving the deposit, and also to report or correct within one month from the date of tax commencement,' we propose to amend to 'should be reported or corrected within one month from the date of tax commencement.' ㊄ In the original draft, Article 6, the phrase 'but the funds of educational and charitable institutions or organizations,' we propose to add the phrase 'or legal entities not for profit.' ㊅ In the original draft, Article 10, 'Unlimited liability shareholders and supervisors,' we propose to delete the four characters 'and supervisors.' (Because supervisors are not legally responsible for execution.) ㊅ In the original draft, Article 11, 'should be at the time of each interest settlement,' we propose to amend to 'should be at the time of each actual payment of interest.' (Because the interest income tax adopts a withholding system, it must be withheld when the interest is actually paid.)"

### Income Tax Office Hosts Banquet for Political and Business Circles

Expedite Preparation of Tax Refund Certificates; Negotiations on Tax Payment for Foreign Nationals

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance and the commencement of various types of income tax collection, the process has been proceeding smoothly. Director Liang Hejun, in order to facilitate inquiries from all sectors, hosted a banquet for various circles in the city the other day. At the same time, due to the small size of the office, the accounting section has been moved to the Bank of China for office work. A reporter from Shenzhou News visited Mr. Liang yesterday afternoon to inquire about the details.

Gratitude for Assistance

The Shanghai Income Tax Office held a banquet for various circles in the city at the New Asia Hotel the other day. Those present included Du Yuesheng of the Local Association, Yu Hongjun and Li Dachao, secretaries of the Municipal Government, Pan Gongzhan, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Section Chief Wu Huanru, Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and all members Ke Ganchen, Gu Xin Yi, Jin Runxiang, Wang Boyuan, Zheng Zenan, as well as Lin Kanghou of the Bankers' Association, accountants Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo, etc. The office has been operating for just over a month, and the smooth progress has exceeded expectations, thanks to the assistance of the municipal authorities and the Local Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc. Therefore, the nation's good tax system can proceed smoothly, and the people's burden of pain can also be reduced. After Director Liang delivered his speech, in addition to expressing his gratitude, he also requested that inquiries on procedures and other matters can be made verbally in addition to official documents, in order to facilitate merchants, because a good tax system is often delayed by slow procedures. At that time, Mr. Wang Xiaolai talked about the rapid processing of tax refunds. The office is negotiating with the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Audit to use tax refund certificates, based on which overpaid taxes will be refunded. Currently, tax returns are filed at the office, and income tax payments are made at the bank, so overpayment may be unavoidable, but the government is determined to refund it.

Smooth Progress

According to Director Liang, income tax is a good direct tax system. Since its commencement, those who have filed and paid taxes have been numerous and the process has been quite smooth. Recently, ㊀ Chinese employees among foreign bank compradors have voluntarily and enthusiastically come to the office to file and pay taxes, which is sufficient to demonstrate their patriotism and will be specially reported to the ministry for commendation in the future. ㊁ Compatriots who deposit funds in foreign banks have also come to the office to voluntarily pay taxes. This spirit is truly capable of revitalizing China and will attract considerable attention from foreigners. ㊂ A reporter from a foreign newspaper visited the other day and was very impressed by the enthusiastic tax filing. ㊃ As for the taxation of foreign nationals, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is already in negotiations, and a concrete decision will be made soon. The process is progressing smoothly. ㊄ Due to the small size of the office, the accounting department has now been moved to the Bank of China for office work. In the future, efforts will be made to gather them at the same location.

Explanation of Procedures

Director Liang continued, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has actively assisted in the implementation of income tax. Currently, in order to enable businesses to understand the procedures for filling out the capital declaration form, the Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a meeting at 2:00 PM on the 5th of this month in the Chamber's auditorium to gather representatives of more than 250 trade associations to hold discussions and invited personnel from the Income Tax Office to attend to explain the procedures. At that time, I (Liang referred to himself) may attend. Liang took a train to Beijing last night because there were matters to be dealt with in the capital.

### Silk and Satin Industries Organize Uniform Research Association

Petition Representatives Return to Shanghai Yesterday; Executive Committee Meeting Decides

The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association and the Electrical Silk Weaving Trade Association's representatives who went to Beijing to petition have returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, a special executive committee meeting was convened to report on the petition process. As a result, it was decided to jointly organize a uniform research association with various silk organizations. The details are as follows:

Executive Committee Meeting

The Silk and Satin Trade Association held its fifth executive committee meeting at its headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Chairman Luo Qinghua reported on the petition process to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry. Then, the following proposals were discussed: ㊀ Regarding the outcome of this petition, the Ministry of Interior hopes that silk organizations will jointly study concrete opinions for government reference. How should this be handled? The resolution was to contact various silk organizations and hire clothing experts to organize a uniform research association to conduct research and contribute to the government for reference at any time. ㊁ How to organize the uniform research committee? The resolution was: (A) This association will nominate Luo Qinghua, Shen Zicha, Jin Haoqing, Shen Jien, Wu Xingcha, Lou Fengshao, Niu Zhizhi, etc., seven people to participate. (B) Send letters to the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association and the Lake Society, each recommending one to three people to participate. (C) Clothing experts will be hired by this association to conduct joint research. ㊂ How should the style of clothing be stipulated in order to contribute to the government for adoption? The resolution was to publish in the newspaper and solicit various uniform style designs for formal wear, mourning clothes, military uniforms, civil servants' uniforms, business suits, student uniforms, etc., and essays explaining the materials and styles. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

Luo Qinghua Speaks

According to Luo's statement to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency yesterday, I went to Beijing this time to ask the central government for instructions, and the results were very satisfactory. When petitioning the Ministry of Interior, Director Chen Nianzhong of the Rites and Customs Department and Secretary Wang Ziqian received him. After stating his opinion, Chen replied that the Uniform Regulations were promulgated by the Ministry of Interior in the 18th year of the Republic, but the Uniform Regulations were not sufficient. The Ministry of Interior is currently soliciting opinions and conducting research from all parties. The principles for amending the Uniform Regulations this time are: ㊀ The established blue gown and black mandarin jacket will definitely not be abolished. ㊁ All uniforms must be limited to domestic products. ㊂ It is hoped that the Shanghai silk organizations will jointly study methods and opinions for government reference. When petitioning the Ministry of Industry, Director Zhang Yichou of the Department of Commerce received him and expressed sympathy for all points of the petition. After completing this petition, I have two major goals: ㊀ To jointly organize a uniform research committee with various silk organizations and hire clothing experts to conduct research and contribute to the government for reference at any time. ㊁ To solicit essays on uniform style designs and the relationship between silk and the international community and people's livelihood, because silk is a unique product of our country with a long history. The annual statistical value is more than 200 million yuan, and more than 30 million people in the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang rely on this for their livelihoods. I am currently organizing a uniform research committee with all parties so that I can make suggestions to the government at any time to make silk increasingly develop, and in terms of economy, there will be more than 200 million yuan in surplus every year.

### Lawsuit Over Construction of Hardoon Building for Lobbying Fees

Xin Shen Construction Company Never Won the Bid; Lobbying Fees Led to Disputes

Lu Nanchu, the owner of Xin Shen Construction Company, wanted to build the Hardoon Foreign Firm building near Nanjing Road and Henan Road last year. Pan Jisun, who lives at No. 9, Lane 76, Chongqing Road, and Fei Linyu, a former employee of Hardoon Foreign Firm, took 5,935 yuan in lobbying fees, but in the end, they still could not win the construction contract. Because of commission disputes, he sued Pan and others in the First Special District Court. The civil lawsuit has not yet ended, and Lu has also filed a private prosecution against Pan and Fei for fraud in the criminal court. The criminal court opened the trial yesterday afternoon. According to the plaintiff Lu Nanchu's statement, Pan came to him at the time and said that Hardoon Foreign Firm wanted to build an eight-story building, and he and Fei Linyu, an employee of the firm, could mediate and ensure that he would win the contract. He signed an agreement that after winning the bid, he would pay Pan a commission of 2.5% and Fei a commission of 5%. The total cost of materials and labor for the entire building would be more than 1 million, so the commissions should be 70,000 to 80,000. Later, Pan said that Mr. Ji's subordinates and Xie Weiyi and Wang Jichen, important figures in the Hardoon Garden, also needed to be rewarded and asked for more money. However, Pan and others took away 5,935 yuan in succession, and the contract ultimately belonged to others. Therefore, he asked to recover the paid funds, but the defendants turned around and sued me for the commission for the piling portion of the contract, which is still in civil litigation. As for Xie and Wang, I found out after investigation that they did not exist. Questioning the defendant Pan Jisun, he stated that the piling project was also introduced by us, and the plaintiff should pay the commission. I only got 500 yuan, and the remaining funds were received by Fei Linyu on behalf of the Hardoon Foreign Firm employees. Fei Linyu said that the commission that should be given to the Hardoon Foreign Firm employees according to the contract price of the piling project was more than 6,980 yuan. It was inconvenient for the firm's employees to collect this money from the plaintiff, so I received it on their behalf, but the plaintiff has not yet paid it off. All the evidence is in the civil case file, and he requested that it be retrieved. The court stated that the two parties in this case are currently in reconciliation outside the court and evidence needs to be investigated, so it was adjourned for further questioning on the afternoon of the 8th of next month.

### Cotton Yarn

Cotton Yarn Market Drops Uniquely This Month

Warehouse Cotton Yarn Stocks Plentiful, Bulls Begin to Roll Over Contracts

Near-Far Price Difference Narrows, Most See Price Declines and Sell Off

The long-term trend in the cotton yarn market is turning upward, but this month has seen a unique decline. This is because current warehouse stocks of cotton yarn are robust, putting pressure on many participants. Some have begun to roll over their contracts, selling this month's contracts and buying contracts for future months. As a result, the price difference between near and far months is narrowing, creating a situation where near-term prices are lower and far-term prices are higher. In the market, some players have flipped from short to long positions, while others have liquidated their long positions. However, the majority are selling off due to expectations of price declines. In the afternoon, rumors of the issuance of national defense bonds caused buying interest to increase slightly, leading to higher prices. Gengfeng bought in large quantities, while Changfeng sold in large quantities, it is said.

June Cotton Yarn Futures Debut Yesterday

Before the opening of the standard cotton yarn market, prices for all months showed signs of rebounding. This was because the "gold gang" (speculators) came in to buy far-month contracts, tightening the market. However, at the opening of the second session, the market for third-grade yarn was mediocre, and a selling frenzy erupted, making the market noticeably looser. Many said that warehouse stocks of cotton yarn were substantial and would not be easily sold off quickly. As a result, momentum weakened significantly, and the closing price for third-grade yarn fell again. Far-month contracts also broke the 240 yuan level, but the long position holders in far-month contracts remained tight and did not give up. The result for standard cotton yarn was that the price for the current month fell by 1.5 to 0.6 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while far-month prices rose by 0.2 yuan. June contracts debuted yesterday at a price of 236.5 yuan, which was 10.04 yuan lower than the debut price for May contracts. At the opening of the afternoon session, the current month remained weak and listless, but long positions in far-month contracts rolled in and tightened. After the second session, it was heard that there were still 1,600 bales of spot cotton yarn traded. The price of third-grade yarn rebounded slightly, and far-month contracts gradually rose. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.269 to 1.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,550 bales, Taixing 1,000 bales, Senkang 1,100 bales, Renfeng 950 bales, Dachangcheng 1,700 bales, Changfeng 6,500 bales, Runkang 4,500 bales, and Tonghe 2,650 bales.

Standard Cotton Benefits from Cotton Yarn Market

June Contracts Open at 44 Yuan

Spot Cotton Consumption Stagnant, Supply Unseen

The cotton market has rebounded, and market sentiment is firm. This is because overseas cotton markets have turned upward, and although cotton stocks in various locations are substantial, arrivals in Shanghai have not been robust recently. As a result, short position holders have been taking profits and covering their positions. However, industry participants tend to sell off. In the afternoon, due to rumors that favored long positions, market prices rose with the cotton yarn market. However, spot cotton trading is quite sluggish, it is said. Before the opening of the standard cotton market, prices for all months rose uniformly, and the situation was tight. This was because American and Indian cotton both turned higher, leading to improved sentiment. However, industry participants still tended to sell off, but prices fell back later. June contracts debuted yesterday at a price of 44 yuan, which was only 0.35 yuan lower than the debut price for May contracts. The result for standard cotton was that prices for all months rose by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon session, market sentiment remained firm and strong, and the market was dry, with selling off not being strong. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Changhe sold 8,200 piculs, Hengde 1,400 piculs, Dachangcheng 4,500 piculs, Yikang 1,000 piculs, Yuanxing 1,300 piculs, Xinhua Chang 1,900 piculs, Yongda 1,300 piculs, Dachang 2,000 piculs, Xiecheng 1,400 piculs, Shenji 2,200 piculs, Shenda 2,800 piculs, and Yuda 2,300 piculs.

Spot Cotton Consumption Stagnant, Mill Demand Listless, Supply Unseen

Japan Did Not Import Indian Cotton Last Week

The Bombay market last week saw a slight rebound due to manufacturers buying in bulk with price limits. However, compared to American cotton, it remained weak. Japanese buyers were absent from the market. Lancashire saw that Indian cotton was cheaper and absorbed a large amount. Cotton mills in mainland China and India did not buy much, as they believed it would be more advantageous to delay purchases until Japan was able to buy. A summary of last week's statistics is attached on the left (in thousands of bales):

### Piece Goods

Sales of Dark-Colored Cloth Are Still Considerable

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw soft sentiment due to the decline in the cotton yarn market. In addition, due to the cold and overcast weather, although there were small-scale transactions in light-colored cloth such as poplin, satin, printed cloth, and bleached cloth, there were no large-scale spot transactions. As a result, blue cloth, drill, broadcloth, and dark-colored printed cloth all showed considerable sales, with blue cloth being particularly strong. However, due to seasonal limitations, sales were short-lived, and the volume of goods sold was ultimately limited. However, the military uniform gangs' demand for 16-pound and 14-pound coarse cloth and coarse twill remained strong. Hua Shang Yong'an, Shenxin, Hengfeng, and other factories were doing their best to catch up with weaving, but there was still a shortage of supply. Spot goods and near-term goods were quite difficult to obtain, and market sentiment was quite firm. English-made Jardine coarse cloth, ranging from 11 to 16 pounds, also saw good sales. The sales of 9-pound coarse cloth were slightly sluggish due to price cuts by Hua Shang Baoxing underwear and Shenxin factories, but the output was not large, and prices did not loosen. The situation for East Asian fine cloth and fine twill was slightly soft. As it was just after the end of the month, both sides were watching and waiting for opportunities to enter and exit the market, and transactions were very quiet, it is said.

"Fire-Ham" Four-Ply Cloth Is Quite Popular

"Fire-Ham" four-ply cloth has been quite popular this spring. Tailors of Western-style clothing in the local area and other places have very strong demand, and daily retail and wholesale transactions are very brisk. There are more new colors arriving than last year. Western-style suits, spring overcoats, hunting attire, and harem pants are now very popular, leading to increasing sales. Yesterday, Riven "Fire-Ham" four-ply cloth was sold wholesale at 5.4 yuan per yard, Friendship at 6.25 yuan, and Rolph at 5.9 yuan.

### Grains

Cold Spring Lingers, Futures Flour Buying Interest Suddenly Surges

Yesterday's flour market saw prices rebounding across all months. The quoted price of foreign wheat had rebounded by about 0.3-0.4 yuan in the past two days. Therefore, at the opening, the quoted price increased due to the rise in foreign prices, and the cold and rainy spring weather also contributed to a sudden surge in buying interest for all months. The current month rose to as high as 4.035 yuan due to factory covering. April rose to 4.0275 yuan due to outside buying. July was opened at 3.5 yuan due to buying by large traders. August opened for the first time at 3.5 yuan, but quickly softened. After the first session, various parties freely offloaded positions, and prices for all months gradually fell back, decreasing by 0.3-0.4 yuan from the highest opening price. At the opening of the afternoon session, prices for March and April fell back to the 4 yuan level due to poor market sentiment, but then rebounded by 0.2-0.3 yuan due to continued factory covering. Sentiment for the new flour in July and August was flat, with little fluctuation. The future situation will depend on actual sales, it is said.

Sales of New Wheat for June and July Are Relatively Strong

Yesterday's wheat futures market saw the quoted price of foreign wheat rebound by about 0.3-0.4 yuan after the opening of the morning session. In addition, the persistent spring rain made market sentiment become harder. Therefore, after the opening, prices for March and April were better by 0.03-0.05 yuan. The early contracts were also stable at first, but then prices fluctuated. At the opening of the afternoon session, the current month was very stable because the goods from the previous month were taken by the Tianjin gangs. Customers entered and exited April, and the market was temporarily calm. The new wheat for June, July, and August saw stronger selling because of the soft price of new flour, decreasing by 0.03-0.05 yuan compared to the morning. The spot wheat market saw stable prices due to both arrivals and sales being quiet. The opening price for Wuyi wheat was 6.6 yuan, Huai'an wheat 6.56 yuan, Jiangbei wheat 6.54 yuan, and Hefei wheat 6.25 yuan. Fuxin took 2,500 bags, and Shenda took 500 bags, it is said.

Sales of Edible Rice in This District Are Still Acceptable

(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the total source of goods from various gangs was over thirty, about six thousand three or four hundred dan of rice. Within that, the amount of Bo Dao rice was over ten. The weather was overcast and rainy, and market sentiment was fixed. Therefore, although the sales in this district were normal, the bag orders were only made from Xi'an and Qingdao gangs who took Bo Dao rice, which was about seven to eight hundred bags. Market conditions exhibited stability. The condition of both thick and thin japonica rice was without both honor and disgrace, the Du Yang Jian and Yin Yuan rice types were similar.

(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the source of goods from each location along the river was not plentiful, about seventeen or eighteen. Because of the overcast and rainy weather, the appetite of each type of good was acceptable. Customer character was tough, as such the high quality of White Japonica rice barely stood, Medium quality was catching up tightly, near the price corner, and the Early Rice followed in tight fashion. The bag orders of Bo Dao rice did not materialize. There were a few transactions in this city. The price shape of the Bo Dao rice was pretty and delicate. The price shape of Du Jian rice exhibited a tight trend. The guest sharp rice price was fixed at Yangfu, and Yin Bian Yuan rice stood tall. Each of the remaining goods' prices were stable. However, at close, the path of each type of good seemed to be stagnant.

There Are Sales of Guest Indica Rice in Both the North and South

— The Market Price Slightly Increased by 0.03-0.05 Yuan Due to Rain —

Yesterday's guest indica rice market situation slightly changed for the better. Although the total volume of goods coming in was still ten to twenty thousand bags, because of the cold and rainy spring weather, there were possible losses for the goods of the spring harvest, merchants' thoughts turned to a more defensive position, and were not as eager to sell off their wares as in previous days. Furthermore, the Cantonese appetite recovered, and Shantou and the Northern seas were both adorned with purchases, and the local appetite was particularly active. The total amount of transactions exceeded twenty thousand bags. Although the market price did not change greatly, market sentiment improved, and the market price surreptitiously strengthened by 0.03-0.05 yuan. Throughout the entire day, a volume of fifteen thousand two hundred bags of Jiangxi rice, seven thousand one hundred bags of Xiang rice, one thousand five hundred bags of Wen Yong rice, and three hundred bags of Han brown rice were opened for sale, with the majority still being purchased by Cantonese gangs.

Oil Prices Decline, Bean Cakes Stable

Recently, there has been no special situation in the oil and bean cake market around the Lantern Festival of the old calendar. Various sources have not yet arrived in large quantities, but sales are also normal. Therefore, market prices have inevitably become weaker. Furthermore, the Dalian Exchange was closed for many days during the Spring Festival, resulting in little change in the exchange market. Yesterday, 700 pieces of various soybean oils were opened for trading in the local market. Market prices fell by 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. Peanut oil also declined by 0.2 yuan, with 800 pieces traded. The sales of bean cakes to Xiamen, Quanzhou, and inland China were still popular. 23,000 pieces of bean cakes from various factories were traded. Market prices were weak at first but then stabilized. The sales of soybean oil from oil mills were still brisk. 7 trucks of Yingzhou beans were traded yesterday, but market prices remained unchanged at the original price of 5.8 yuan. A total of 1,600-1,700 bags of other inland and local beans were traded, it is said.

### Silk and Tea

User Silk Is More Lively

Yesterday's silk industry saw no market in New York on the day, and the Yokohama selling rate saw fluctuations for distant contracts. A total of -7 yuan for spot and +1 yuan for distant contracts. The Shanghai silk market hovered with hesitation. Because of the sluggish overseas silk market prices and stagnant sales, market sentiment also exhibited a tendency to soften. Yesterday, the foreign merchant silk market was calm. The user silk market was more lively. The America-Asia Silk Factory and each silk weaving factory slightly bought in. White factory, Tiantai, and zebra brands saw some sales opened, but the market rate was about 5 yuan to 10 yuan lower than in early last week. Yesterday, a total of 45 bags were opened for sale.

### Metals

Sales of 5mm Steel Plates Are Strong

Since overseas prices for 5mm steel plates have trended upwards, prices in this port have also risen accordingly. For example, lightweight steel plates are estimated at 15 yuan per dan, and heavyweight steel plates are estimated at 14 yuan. However, because the prices are too high, there have been few transactions. Recently, industry participants in this port, seeing the unfavorable environment, are willing to lower prices to sell. Therefore, lightweight steel plates are estimated at 14 yuan, and heavyweight steel plates are estimated at 13 yuan. Trading has suddenly increased due to the rush of buyers, with gangs from Qingdao, Yantai, Hankou, Shantou, and Xiamen all buying. As a result, the market situation has suddenly become brisk, and industry participants on this street are also frantically adding to their stocks, fearing that current stocks will run out. As a result, transactions have increased sharply. It is estimated that over one to two thousand dan have been sold, and there are still many people in negotiations. Therefore, the market situation is very optimistic.

### Review of the American Economy and Silk Consumption (3)

— Tian Yu

It is very clear here that the area of silk consumption has been more deeply encroached upon by other clothing fibers. The threat of silk retreating is naturally the result of the expansion of the territory of rayon. However, silk has superior qualities, such as luster and strength, which are unmatched by rayon. Moreover, the recovery of the American economy, the largest customer, and the increased share of silk's exclusive territory in women's hosiery by 12%, etc., should have been good opportunities for exceptional development. Why is it that consumption not only does not increase proportionally with the economic recovery, but also decreases significantly? This is not easily understood by the average person. However, if we analyze it carefully, we will find that this phenomenon is not accidental.

Originally, the rise of the economy inevitably leads to rising object prices. The price of silk, following the expensive trend of the second half of the previous year, has maintained its relatively high price. This can be seen in the table below:

Spring and Autumn

### Sin

— Yan Chonglou

Sin is not etched on people's faces.

People who hide great sins often point fingers at people who reveal small mistakes!

One should not say that there is no sin, it is just that sin has not been revealed.

Everyone hopes for rewards for merits, but no one hopes for punishment for sins.

People's criminal behavior mostly occurs when they are poor.

Increasing the effectiveness of the law is not as good as reducing the root causes of crime.

Those who help people commit crimes are more sinful than those who commit crimes.

A person uses money to commit crimes, and can also use money to cover up his crimes!

In human nature, there is a kind of goodness and a kind of evil. Because goodness is good, it is often overcome by evil. Therefore, people should cultivate their own goodness to suppress their own evil.

For a person who is currently behaving well, there is no need to ask about his past mistakes and sins.

### Zhang Taiyan's Reasons for Opposing Vernacular Poetry

— Yan Feikun

Ever since Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi, and their group advocated new poetry and overthrew old poetry, those who followed suit for a time had a "stormy" effect, especially among young people. However, opponents also arose one after another. The two sides firmly guarded the old and new fortifications, fighting fiercely for many years. Up to now, the old and new "go their separate ways" without a real result.

Mr. Zhang Taiyan is also a member of the old fortifications who opposes the new poetry. People who do not know the bottom think that Mr. Zhang is "seeing what is benevolent and seeing what is wise," but that is wrong. Originally, Mr. Zhang's reasons for opposing the new poetry, from the standpoint of "poetry," are truly "justified." For example, in Mr. Zhang's "Reply to Huang Jiashu's Letter," there are places where he discusses new poetry. He said: "...Vernacular poetry did not originate with modern people. Yuan and Bai often had it. What I oppose is its lack of rhyme, not its use of the vernacular. Therefore, I use Shi Siming's "Cherry Poem" as a taunt. Generally speaking, poetry must be eternal words. If the rhythm is long and there is no rhyme to harmonize it, then listening to it will definitely be unpleasant. This is why the ancients had no unrhymed poetry. Moreover, if poetry has no rhyme, then chanting history is no different from historical commentary; generally chanting mountains and rivers, scenery, and narrating the difficulty of traveling is no different from travelogues. Why must it be called poetry?..."

This passage breaks through the shortcomings of new poetry in one sentence. We should nod our heads and be pleased. Even those who advocate it, I think, may not have sufficient reason to come and defend it.

### Hair Buns

— Wei Jing

Since the Republic of China, women's hairstyles can be said to have exhausted all possibilities of change.

Qing Dynasty-style hair buns were eliminated along with the revolutionary tide. At that time, men were in vogue with haircuts, so women imitated the ancient style and moved the hair buns that hung behind their heads to the top of their heads, shaped like cow dung, beautifully named "Pan Xiang" (Coiled Incense) buns, but some directly called them "cow dung" buns. Due to the habit of three hundred years, there was always a feeling of being unaccustomed to wearing the hair bun on the top of the head, so after a short time, it returned to the back of the head. Then, the Pan Xiang bun at the back of the head changed into a "Bo Xin" bun, also called "Feng Liang" (Cool Breeze) bun. The initial period of the Bo Xin bun was close to the back of the head. Afterwards, it gradually drooped downwards, reaching below the shoulders. The more it drooped, the more fashionable it was. However, later on, every piece of clothing was stained with a large oil stain, so the "Shan Zi" (Fan) bun, which was close to the back of the head, came into being. It was narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, shaped like an open folding fan. However, the procedure of combing the Fan bun was complicated and took at least an hour, so it evolved into the "Shu Ai Si" (Vertical S-shape) bun, and further into the "Heng Ai Si" (Horizontal S-shape) bun. When the National Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition, secured Wuhan, and recovered Songhu (Shanghai), women's hair buns were all cut off by hairdressers. As a result, the ever-changing hair bun problem was fundamentally solved. Although recently there have occasionally been a few modern women who styled their remaining hair into diamond-shaped buns to show off their uniqueness, these are only a very small number. The fate of the hair bun has largely reached its final stage. In another twenty years, the hair bun may be naturally eliminated.

In the past, hair buns were regarded as a sign of a woman's diligence or laziness. Shiny hair meant diligence, and vice versa. Therefore, before women cut their hair buns, the first thing they did every morning was to comb their hair buns, which was quite troublesome. However, now that the hair buns are gone, the remaining hair has become the standard for whether a woman is fashionable or not. Only those with fashionable perms are valued, otherwise, they are considered country women. It can be seen that the ancients always said that hair was "three thousand strands of worry," which was indeed true. Furthermore, women always liked to insert a head full of pearls and jade when combing their hair buns, which cost a lot. After cutting their hair, they had a water perm every half month and an electric perm every month, the cost of which was also considerable. Therefore, women's cutting of hair buns is not actually a kind of progress, but merely a transformed hair bun. The ancients had a saying about watching hair combing under a crystal curtain, which everyone regarded as a romantic affair. When haircuts were first introduced, people generally thought that the disappearance of hair buns was a great disappointment. However, after the hair buns were gone, women still could not do without combing their hair in front of the mirror every day. At the same time, they all carried a small comb in their handbags. Even in the tram, there were still those who combed their temples in front of the mirror. Going without hair buns is more elegant than before, which may not be what most people expected.

### Chewing Betel Nuts

— Xi Kan

People in Changsha City often give each guest a small packet of Guizi betel nuts after a feast. It is said that in southern Hunan, betel nuts have become a daily necessity, probably due to the proximity to the Five Ridges, which helps to dispel dampness and epidemics. Many of my friends are from Xiangtan, and they all like to chew betel nuts. I can only chew Guizi betel nuts, but I cannot handle the heavy gray betel nuts that people from Xiangtan chew. That kind of betel nut tastes bitter and astringent, and the lime on it, I don't know if it's natural lime or oyster shell lime, is really unpalatable!

The habit of chewing betel nuts among southerners has a long history. There are records of betel nuts in the History of the Southern Dynasties, but unfortunately, I cannot recall the original text from memory. Zhou Qufei of the Song Dynasty said in his "Ling Wai Dai Da," Volume 8: Betel nuts are produced in the Li Dong area of Hainan and also in Jiaozhi. The tree is like a palm tree, and the fruits grow between the leaves, like willow branches, with berries clustered on them. The ones picked in spring are soft betel nuts, which are very delicious. The ones picked in summer and autumn are dried and called rice betel nuts, and those soaked in salt are called salt betel nuts. The small and pointed ones are called chicken heart betel nuts, and the large and flat ones are called big belly betel nuts, all of which are medicines for regulating qi. Sea merchants sell them, and the Qiong officials collect five out of ten taxes on them annually. The Guangzhou Customs collects betel nut tax, tens of thousands of strings of cash per year. Therefore, the amount collected in various places is uncountable.

Based on this record, we can know that in the Song Dynasty, betel nut tax was also a major source of revenue for Guangzhou, and the prevalence of chewing betel nuts at that time can be imagined. At the same time, in this record, I learned about the origin, shape, type, and function of betel nuts. According to my experience, chewing betel nuts after a meal generates a lot of saliva, which undoubtedly helps digestion. Moreover, after drinking and eating to excess, and getting tired of oily food, chewing a betel nut makes one feel refreshed and comfortable. As for its disadvantages, that is unknown. Old medical books say that it lowers qi and consumes qi, which seems mysterious and intangible. I hope that medical experts will take the time to test betel nuts and analyze their composition in order to determine their effectiveness.

### The Mated Phoenixes

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter Eleven (Whispered Sympathy for Mother's Heart, Repentance, Filial Piety, Autumn Light Dimmed, Dark Eyebrows, Evoking Thoughts at the Scenery)

Menglan nodded with a smile and said, "Second sister-in-law, every word you say is the truth. Second brother probably said a lot of bad things about me behind my back, right?" The second young mistress repeatedly shook her head and said, "Your second brother has never mentioned a word to me." Menglan smiled and said, "Sister-in-law, don't misunderstand. What I'm asking isn't whether my brother is discussing my shortcomings behind my back. But like what second sister-in-law said, I'm neither new nor old now, and I can't make a living." The second young mistress, because she had been sitting for a long time, had wrinkles in her clothes, so she stood up and tugged at her clothes a few times. Looking down at her chest, she raised her eyelids and looked at Menglan's face. She smiled and said, "But Mother sometimes mentions you, saying that the younger sister is getting older every year, and she'll graduate soon, but what will happen after graduation?" Menglan smiled and said, "I can't become an official after graduation." The second young mistress said, "It's not for that. Mother means that a girl, even if she lives to be a hundred years old, is still someone else's person. But the old lady can't figure out what you mean at all. So because of these things, her old illness is probably not easy to get rid of completely. The more time passes, the more people are pressing her, and they might force some illness out of the old lady." As she said this, she frowned. Menglan said, "Who is pressing her more and more?" The second young mistress, who was originally wearing a worried look on her face, smiled slightly when she heard this. Menglan picked up a piece of pine nut candy in the dish, but put it down again. She probably understood very well how this smile on her sister-in-law's face came about. So she put down the candy and suddenly stood up and said, "If Mother has any difficulties, just tell me. Even if I'm unfilial, I can't let the old lady lose her old life because of me." The second young mistress said, "It's not that bad. It seems..." As she said this, she tilted her head and pretended to be thinking. Then she continued, "I heard that the Liu family recently sent someone to set a date again. It's between September and October. And they added that if it's because of the younger sister's studies that this date can't be agreed upon, that's a small matter. After the happy event, you can still let the younger sister go to school as before. Mother didn't say anything, but Father probably agreed. Mother tried several times to tell you, but she was always afraid that you would be unhappy. Originally, what girl is willing to leave her mother? Mother is just worried, so her health is not very good." The more Menglan listened, the paler her face became. She sat down, lowered her head, and fiddled with the corner of her clothes, unable to speak for a long time. The second young mistress was also secretly watching her constantly. She didn't interrupt at this time. (139)

Short Stories

### Sound of Waves and Misty Rain

— Xia Fei

The continuous cold rain seemed to have thrown my heart into a gloomy sea, and my heart was soaked in that gloomy taste. So, I began to feel disgusted with this bitter rural life.

I returned to my hometown sadly, and it has been more than a week in a hurry; but those three or four days of rain really made me feel more uncomfortable than being in prison. Especially at night, I often sat alone, staring blankly at the dim light, listening to the rustling sound of rain outside the window; that endless loneliness was gnawing at my heart like a poisonous snake, and I was in pain.

Finally, on a drizzly morning, I resolutely left my family, taking this simple suitcase and embarking on that distant journey. The whistle had already sounded for the second time, so many passengers swarmed towards the ship, and a burst of commotion shook the ship. We went down to the cabin, and the ship turned its head and sailed into the waves, and the lines of sight of the senders and the departed gradually disappeared in the sound of "take care."

There were not many people in the cabin. I occupied a corner and sat down, looking out the window, a kind of melancholy and a kind of loneliness chasing me closely.

The wind was howling like crazy, and the ship was bumping in the waves. We were all like children sleeping in a cradle, rolling to this side for a moment and falling to that side for another. The teapot and teacups on the table were also overturned. Many people were frightened, children were crying, and women were vomiting by the side of the ship. I stared blankly at the lake, which was shrouded in a white misty rain, as if covered with a heavy layer of wet fog. Waves as high as small hills crashed down on the side of the ship one after another, and the ship swayed with the ups and downs of the waves; spray flew onto the deck, and the glass windows rattled. The raindrops hit the surface of the waves, showing honeycomb-like holes, but they immediately disappeared with the waves.

The loud sound of waves and the crisp sound of rain were making a noise on the vast Taihu Lake, like the sound of a mountain collapsing.

The ship seemed to be a stubborn animal, carrying dozens of lives, bravely, braving the waves, facing the wind and rain, and moving forward in the long misty waves. The blurry isolated islands and vague shadows of mountains passed by the side of the ship.

When the ship was approaching Xukou, a patch of black dots suddenly appeared on the hazy lake surface, more than ten feet away from the ship. It looked like many things were floating on the water, or like stars crowded in the sky, arranged very neatly. Looking at them from a distance, they were really beautiful.

"What is that? Are they cormorants!" a fashionable girl exclaimed happily, forgetting the pain of seasickness just now. Then, the young man in a suit next to her seemed to correct her mistake and said:

"No, these are ducks, ducks are wild ducks." A white-sailed boat gradually drifted from the mountain, and very quickly, it approached the middle of a patch of black dots, so, only a burst of sound was heard, and countless black dots all flew into the sky. At that moment, only a black shadow was seen moving in the sky.

The ship was sailing in the sound of waves and misty rain, but the people in the cabin calmed down as if they were exhausted. When it was close to entering the port, the wind weakened and the waves calmed down, but the endless bitter rain was still dripping on the deck.

Special Feature

### The Dry Bridge

— Xu Xia Wei

"Dry Bridge!" It quietly spans over the railway, holding the transportation hub connecting the west side of the North Railway Station to the other side of the railway; Its style. Although it is very simple, it also contains the inherent oriental aesthetics of China. The wooden railings, the wooden pillars, everything is made of wood. However, it has its characteristics, it has its advantages. On the contrary, all the equipment is for practical use, and it is not just a kind of decoration for appreciation. Although, there is also a tall dry bridge in the South Railway Station. Maybe other provinces and cities have its similar types, but everything is famous because of its merits. The achievements of the North Station Dry Bridge are indeed likely to surpass other places. Therefore, when we people living in Shanghai mention the Dry Bridge, the one between Xinmin Road and Qiujiang Road will pop up in our minds!

The twentieth-century monsters filled with passengers and goods are constantly coming and going under its belly, and I don’t know how many people pass by on its back every day. It is not angry, it is not acting coquettish, it is not afraid of violent encroachment, nor is it afraid of the ravages of wind and frost. It faithfully serves the society and mankind. For decades, it has been like a day. It is indeed a calm, hardworking, and practical offender who does not advocate slogans. Its achievements are truly great! If it were gone for a day, the nearby traffic would be disrupted, and people coming and going would complain even more, but now few people can pay attention to it, and even hate it. Really, I really feel very wronged for it.

It once witnessed the January 28th Incident, the bloody battle for national survival, and even witnessed the barbaric acts of a certain country's military expansion. The bloody battle lasted for thirty-four days, and our army finally retreated due to strategic reasons! It! - Dry Bridge - also suddenly lost protection, but it seemed to be determined to coexist and die with the country, always standing still, not being afraid, not escaping, and the enemy's fierce artillery fire and huge bombs could not damage it. As a result, the Shanghai War ended, and it still faithfully served the society. General Weng Zhaoyuan said: "Bullets will automatically avoid brave soldiers." Indeed, it was a victory.

"The head can be broken, the blood can flow, but the country cannot be destroyed."

The Shanghai War is now five years ago! All the constructions destroyed by the warmongers have gradually returned to their original state. Under the government's efforts to revive, it is impossible to find the traces of the bloody battle between the two armies that year. Only on the cement retaining wall of the south embankment of the Dry Bridge, there are still such vaguely distinguishable, generous and passionate characters written in lime water by the Independent 156th Brigade of the Army.

Talks

### Banning Dancing and Smoking and Leading by Example

— Xiao Mei

The joint meeting of the directors of moral education of middle schools in the city, convened by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, was held at the YMCA the day before yesterday. In addition to discussing the banning of middle school students from dancing and smoking cigarettes, Pan, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, personally attended to report the significance of the meeting and to provide guidance on moral education. It can be seen how concerned the authorities are about the future of young students.

Director Pan said in his report: "...In addition to implementing the prescribed plan for moral education, the most effective method is for teachers and students to be able to live together. As the saying goes, 'Teaching by example is better than teaching by words,' and 'Teaching by example is followed, while teaching by words is disputed.' It can be seen that leading by example is the best method of moral education: Scholars follow, and students are originally imitating others, but imitation must have a model, and teachers are the model for students, so the director of moral education should help the principal, and make all teachers and staff understand this meaning, and everyone leads by example as a good model for students, so that students, no matter who they learn from, can improve every day and become healthy citizens. ..."

How to cultivate young students to become "healthy citizens"? Leaving aside other conditions, leading by example is always an essential condition. Or, because of the misunderstanding of "being a teacher," his world view and outlook on life do not conform to the spirit of the times, and thus will lead pure students to a dead end, but that is already another question; I believe that students themselves will also have standards for what to choose and discard. Middle school students are no longer kindergarten children. They will certainly not believe that one plus two equals three. Even if they do believe it, they will compare this answer with the "modern facts of the country" to see if it is three.

Therefore, I think, whether the qualifications of "being a teacher" are sufficient is another question. But to make students believe in the teacher and become "teachers are the model for students," leading by example is always an essential condition. For example, one of the motions at this joint meeting was "how to prohibit middle school students from dancing and smoking cigarettes," and I hope that in the future, no middle school principals, directors of moral education, or even teachers and staff will be found in dance halls, even if they declare when they are found that they are there to investigate whether students have violated the ban, the result will not be believable. As for smoking cigarettes, it is inevitable that they will not smoke in the classroom or the teachers' lounge in the future, but I also hope that they will not smoke in other places, even in their residences or where they think other people will not notice. Because it is not a resolution, it is okay not to lead by example, but if it is resolved, and those who are "teachers" should lead by example, then if unfortunately discovered, in addition to violating the ban, there is also the malpractice of teaching students to comply in public and defy in private, and to cheat in private.

But, can the "teachers" do it? I dare not say that they cannot, but I also dare not write a guarantee that they are all-powerful. For example, not long ago, we saw in the newspaper the news that a principal was suing a hotel for opening a long room. "Opening a long room" is certainly not among smoking and dancing, but modern education says that teaching students to open long rooms, it seems that it is not to that point.

Leading by example is essential in teaching: whether leading by example is contrary to the spirit of the times or not, we are willing to compare it with the "modern facts of the country": now, let's "listen to their words and watch their actions" to see what happens later.

### Homesickness

— Li Liwen

Calmness like a thin veil gently covered the entire school, the school like an ancient temple, like - a large无人的architecture, everywhere touching the desolate atmosphere.

The dormitory, which I usually disliked for its noise, was mostly empty. The dim light from the oil lamp in the corridor and the candle on my desk reminded me of the Buddha hall in an ancient temple! Did the huqin break its sound, and did the Brahma bells go mute?

...Defeated by melancholy! Although I have been wandering for five or six years, crossing countless mountains and rivers, how can anyone forget their home? When it gets dark, birds also return to their nests; when the sun sets, cows also return to their sheds - how can anyone forget their home?

Among the dozens of people left, Liu was the only one I recognized. Although we didn't have any deep friendship in the past few days, we have had a deep friendship with each other in recent days. He originally lived in the house opposite me. Because of loneliness, he moved over the day before yesterday.

Liu is a tall man, his cheeks full of thought, his hair messy and long, as if he hasn't shaved for years. He likes to drink and shell peanuts, and his capacity for alcohol is not necessarily great, but when he gets drunk, he talks non-stop. He is from Heilongjiang. Like me, he hasn't reunited at home for five years. When he is drunk, he often says to me:

"Don't be like a girl! Who doesn't have a home - just don't think about it! Speaking of which: your home is in Southeast Asia, but it's just a bit far away; for me, it's probably difficult to go back. Come on, have a drink. The ancients said it well: wine can dispel sorrow. Once the brain is messed up, home - you won't think about anything. ..."

I can't drink alcohol, the bitter taste of alcohol scares me, and I always remember how my mother cared for me; every time, Liu's invitation was therefore rejected by me. ...However, I couldn't resist it after all. Every day, I watched Liu, awake and depressed, pour cup after cup of wine into his stomach, and then, with a flushed face, excitedly, spewing saliva, talk or sing loudly, and when he got tired or his tongue stiffened, he would go down and start snoring. It seemed that wine really dispelled his sorrow. ...I became envious. ...One day, when Liu was drunk, I swallowed four glasses of Wujiapi in one breath. ...Gradually, I felt both my ears and cheeks becoming hot, my head a little dizzy, but I didn't want to speak. Although the thoughts were rising and falling and stirring non-stop, my mouth seemed to be getting tighter and tighter. I lay down and felt unusually uncomfortable. It seemed that the bed and the house were shaking, as if someone was pressing hard on my chest, making me unable to breathe. I wanted to cry as if I had been wronged. I wanted to be quiet, but I couldn't control myself. My blood seemed to be boiling all over my body, as if it wanted to rush out. ...I felt unusually annoyed, and suddenly thought of going somewhere cool outside, I put on my coat, I rushed out of the dormitory and went to the fields.

The fields looked unusually desolate under the gray and heavy sky. I wandered aimlessly in the wet soil of the fields...until I began to feel cold, the cold north wind had frozen my ears and nose red and stiff; my feet also seemed a little sore, and a little hard. ...When I came back, I was much clearer, and the journey was especially strenuous. ...

Back in the dormitory, I immediately heard Liu singing Xue Li sighing at the moon.

"He's drunk again?"

I thought. And I was a little dazed again. ...

### In a Simplified Primary School

— Huang Jing

Failed again! I spent the entire summer vacation staying in Tianjin looking for a job. Yet I gained nothing! I’ve reached the end of my rope, what should I do? Everything will become a dream! But I still have to live, to live with the greatest courage! So, I returned to Beiping with a heavily wounded heart, placing my last hope there. But how could that work? Beiping, this ancient city swaying in the wind and rain, is not what it used to be! Its throat has been seized by the claws of a powerful beast! It is not allowed to breathe freely! Only two years after I left it, it has become so terrifying! Countless innocent people are opening their mouths in hunger, searching everywhere for a bowl of rice! Everything clearly suggests to me that there is no hope of finding a job! So desperate, none of my friends have the ability to take care of me. Under these circumstances, I wanted to leave immediately, but unexpectedly, a friend actually found me a teaching position at a "Simplified Primary School." I could earn a salary of "thirteen yuan" per month. Although this terrible and pathetic amount of "thirteen yuan" is also called a "salary," I have to accept this rice bowl!

I didn't know before that this "ancient cultural city" of Beiping had so-called "Simplified Primary Schools." There used to be "People's Schools," but there were very few of them. Now, these "Simplified Primary Schools" exist in every district. Perhaps the government is also implementing a policy of universal education, so they are also extending their favor to the children of the poor. These kinds of primary schools are established by the "Autonomous District Public Offices"! In name, it is "poor children can study without money," but in reality, the education expenses still come from the poor themselves, and those running the education are still skimming profits from it. On the surface, it is "entirely for the benefit of the common people."

All the simplified primary schools in the city are named after the street where the school is located. Our school is located on "Fenfang Liuli Street" outside Xuanwumen, so the school is called "Fenfang Liuli Street Simplified Primary School." The school is located in a Guangdong Guild Hall. Although there is a golden plaque with the words "Lianqin Guild Hall" at the gate, only two Guangdong people live inside. The rest of the people are very mixed. There are storytellers of drum ballads, hawkers, and people who run foreign car factories. This is completely a large mixed courtyard.

Both classrooms are dark and filthy! The old plaster on the walls has peeled off! The brick corners are exposed. The wooden frames of the windows have been damaged beyond repair by the wind and rain, and there is no way to paste paper on them. Even if the cold autumn wind is unrestrained, they have to endure it. The students huddle together quietly; they are used to suffering, and suffering has long conquered them!

If you walk into this classroom, you are sure to be startled if you are not careful. The potholes on the ground will make you stumble! Even more pitiful are the desks and benches, almost all missing a leg or having three legs. Not a single bench does not need bricks to prop it up. Sometimes, while I am lecturing, a student suddenly falls from the bench, causing a burst of laughter. Because of these desks and benches, students are constantly fighting, complaining to the teacher, and being beaten to settle the matter. But those who run the education do not pay attention to these educational facilities. They always feel that it is already extraordinary that poor children can be given books to read, how can they look for comfort?

The most active person in the school is not the "principal," but Lao Bai, the errand boy and messenger. He has one eye. According to him, he used to be a soldier, got injured, and is now retired. No student is not subject to his control. He says one is one, and two is two. Those poor children do not know how to resist him. Every day he buys some food from outside and sells it at school, doubling the price.

## Page 20

The principal never comes to class on time. Sometimes I have already finished a class when he arrives at school. However, if the Autonomous District Public Office wants to send someone to inspect, he arrives at school early in the morning, ordering the errand boy to sweep this and sweep that, and scaring the students: "Whoever makes noise or talks when the inspector comes will be expelled!"

A month passed! My "salary" was not paid. It was not until the tenth of the second month that I received it. Later, Lao Bai secretly told me that the principal is used to withholding teachers' salaries. In fact, the Public Office sends the salaries at the end of the month.

Hou Jiuxia "Mao Family Book"

Li Shude (940) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM

Opening "Perspective"

All the flowers have bloomed, and the fragrance of plum blossoms remains. The most miserable thing in life is illness. Food and drink are nothing but soup and medicine. The only one who serves is Little Mei Xiang. How hateful, the evil illness often torments me. Making me, feeble and listless. Seeing through that there is no benefit in life. It is hard to avoid death, young or old. But I compare my body to a house. Teeth are the door and the mouth is like the hall. Fine black hair is like roof tiles. Clear eyes are like emerald silk windows. The eyes are like pairs and the ears are like paintings. The bridge of the nose is like a large central hall. Hands and feet are like the pillars of the house. The back is like the beam of the house. Twenty-four ribs are the rafters, and the winding intestines are like a winding corridor. Ten fingers are busy welcoming guests. A winding wall and a stinking skin bag. When the day of impermanence arrives. The doors and windows are closed. Spring green is like a magnificent room. Old age is like a collapsed hall. Wealth and glory are originally false. Like a dream of yellow millet. Millions of fortunes are hard to carry with you. Only leaving behind. A lonely soul drifting to the west, I am one who has seen through the world and wishes to cultivate myself.

### "One in a Million" to be Released

Ice Skating Queen's Stunning Work

Sonja Henie, a Norwegian girl, has won the ice skating championship three times in a row in the World Games. Her reputation has long been famous throughout the world. The golden statues and trophy awards in her home fill an entire room. She has also performed many times before emperors and kings in various European countries, and has received no small number of precious awards. She is not only good at ice skating, but also a famous ice skating queen in Europe. Therefore, Twentieth Century Fox specifically spared no expense to invite her to star in the film "One in a Million" (it is said that her salary for starring in this film was $150,000), and also selected many good supporting actors for her. Sonja Henie has displayed all her skills in this film, which is truly a magnificent sight. It is rumored that the film will soon be released at the Grand Guangming Theater, and it is indeed a good film worth watching.

### A Scene from Minxin Phonograph's "New Humanitarianism"

### "In Spring"

— One of the Interludes from "Crossroads" —

The new Mingxing film directed by Shen Xiling, starring Zhao Dan, Bai Yang, Ying Yin, Lü Ban, Sha Meng, Yi Ming, etc., "Crossroads," has been completely filmed and passed the Central Inspection Committee. It depicts four typical types of young people: one revolutionary, one wavering, one optimistic, and one pessimistic. The subject matter is realistic, the style is fresh, and there is an interlude called "In Spring," with lyrics written by the famous female poet Guan Lu and music composed by He Luting. The lyrics are recorded below:

"In spring, white flowers are fragrant, lang li ge lang li ge lang li ge lang, the warm sun shines in the sky, shining on my ragged clothes, lang li ge lang li ge lang li ge lang, walking through the streets and alleys, for food and for clothing, busy morning and night, lang li ge lang li ge lang li ge lang, even without money, I must eat a bowl of rice, and I must have a room to live in, even if the landlady makes strange faces, lang li ge lang li ge lang li ge lang. Poverty does not fall from the sky, raw iron can be tempered into steel, as long as we work hard and move forward, even if high mountains block the road, lang li ge lang li ge lang li ge lang, met a good girl, a dear good girl, a naive girl, don't be sad, don't be hurt, life is like a battlefield, be healthy, be strong, work hard on a shift, be healthy, be strong, everyone work hard on a shift."

### Amazing Lu Ming

Yihua's sorrowful and beautiful epic film, written by Pan Zienong and directed by Chen Kengran, "Elastic Daughter," took half a year and cost a huge sum of money. Nineteen parts have been completed, and it will soon meet the audience. Lu Ming sings the song "Swallows in Pairs" and the theme song of "Elastic Daughter" in "Elastic Daughter," which is deeply moving. Her expression is so profound that she has the style of the Eastern Marlene Dietrich. She is truly a promising movie star.
