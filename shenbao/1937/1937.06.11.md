### Legislative Yuan Passes Sichuan Province Disaster Relief Bonds Ordinance

Principle of Unified Name Confirmation Determined and Passed; Conscription Law Changed to Military Conscription Law

[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan held its 107th meeting on the morning of the 11th, with 71 committee members, including Zhao Maohua, in attendance. Sun Ke chaired the meeting, and Liang Han Cao served as Secretary-General. Matters discussed: (1) The draft ordinance and amortization schedule for the Sichuan Province Disaster Relief Bonds of the Republic of China for the 26th year. Resolution: 1. Passed as amended by the Finance Committee. 2. Requested the Executive Yuan to strictly order the Sichuan Provincial Government to include a disaster relief reserve fund item in the provincial budget for the 26th year in accordance with the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law to further consolidate the bond fund. 3. If the second issue of the provincial disaster relief bonds of 6 million yuan is funded by the disaster relief reserve fund, it will clearly violate Article 9 of the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law. If it is necessary to continue issuing the bonds, other sources of funds should be raised. (2) The draft general budget for local ordinary revenue and expenditure of Zhejiang Province for the 25th year. Resolution: Passed as reviewed by the Finance Committee. Revenue and expenditure were each listed as 28,938,578 yuan. Also, the inclusion of a disaster relief reserve fund of 300,000 yuan in the administrative expenses in the budget was not clearly defined and should be removed and listed as a separate item to be more realistic. However, the current year is coming to an end and should be included in the final accounting. (3) The draft general budget for local ordinary revenue and expenditure of Fujian Province for the 25th year. Resolution: Passed as reviewed by the Finance Committee. Revenue and expenditure were each listed as 19,424,3171 yuan. (4) The draft ordinance for encouraging private railway development. Resolution: Passed as reviewed by the Economic and Military Affairs Committees. Adopted the Ministry of Railways' opinion to postpone deliberation. (5) The proposal to implement immigration and border development to save unemployed people and strengthen national defense. Resolution: Passed as reviewed by the Economic and Military Affairs Committees. There is no need to enact separate laws for immigration and border development. (6) The conscription law. Resolution: The title of the bill was changed to Military Conscription Law, and the content was returned to the Military Affairs and Legal Affairs Committees for review. The Industrial Mobilization Law will be formulated when necessary. (7) The proposal to determine the principle of unified name confirmation and amend related regulations. Resolution: Passed as reviewed by the Civil Law and Commercial Law Committees. Article 19 of the Civil Law and Article 115 of the Company Law do not need to be amended. The proposal was initiated by Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, who argued that inconsistent names made it difficult to determine rights and obligations. Therefore, he advocated amending Article 19 of the Civil Law and Article 115 of the Company Law regarding the issue of name rights, so that a person's name, as recognized by law, would only be one and not two, with the name recorded in the household registration as the primary name, thereby preventing all disputes and eliminating all malpractices. The review by the Yuan Committee resulted in the opinion that Article 19 of the Civil Law protects name rights to prevent unlawful infringement. Wu's proposal to unify names to determine the subject of rights and eliminate all difficulties was well-intentioned. However, name rights are only one type of right, and the subject of rights is the person, not the name. Moreover, although the Household Registration Law has been implemented, it has not yet been universally applied. If it is stipulated that a name not registered in the household registration cannot be the subject of rights, it would not be entirely consistent with the general situation of society at present. Regarding Wu's proposal to delete the words "or name" in the second paragraph of Article 115 of the Company Law or to delete the entire second paragraph, corporations can also be shareholders of companies, but corporations only have names and no surnames. If the company stock cannot record the name, it would be difficult to apply when the corporation is a shareholder. Therefore, it was resolved that Article 19 of the Civil Law and Article 115 of the Company Law do not need to be amended. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 11th)

### Full Text of the Verdict in the Yang Yongtai Assassination Case (Continued from Yesterday)

Civil Verdict

Criminal incidental civil action judgment No. 384 of the 25th year of the Hubei Wuchang District Court

Plaintiffs: Yang Li Wuzhen, 56 years old; Yang Yixi, 31 years old; Yang Yunxi, 29 years old; Yang Qiuxi, 23 years old; Yang Yanxi, 19 years old; Yang Chenxi, 15 years old; Yang Jinxi, 12 years old; Yang Huaixi, 8 years old. Right four people’s determination agent, Yang Tang Xueyong, 37 years old; joint litigation agent, Yang Shengkan, lawyer.

Defendants: Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao (alias Tan Wenxin, Tan Rongxuan), Cheng Da, Gong Bozhou (alias Gong Bosheng), Gong Shaoyuan, Gong Ding, Cao Bingrong (alias Zhang Jiayi), Yang Xiaoming (alias Yang Erqian), Xu Qun, Xu Chao, Yang Yousheng, Yang Bokun, Yang Qizhen; Fugitive, Fan Qishu (fugitive).

The plaintiffs filed an incidental civil suit due to the defendants' murder case. The judgment of this court is as follows:

Main text

The defendants Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Bozhou, and Cao Bingrong shall jointly and severally compensate the plaintiffs for damages of 20,000 yuan in national currency and 10,000 yuan in national currency for consolation. The plaintiffs' remaining claims are dismissed. The litigation proceedings regarding the defendants Yang Xiaoming and Fan Qishu are suspended.

Facts

The defendant Liu Luyin incited Cheng Xiechao and others to jointly murder Yang Yongtai, the former Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government. The plaintiffs filed an incidental civil suit during the criminal proceedings, requesting the court to order the defendants to be jointly and severally liable for paying 118,560 yuan in support fees and 100,000 yuan in consolation money.

Reasons

According to Article 504 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment of an incidental civil suit shall be based on the facts determined by the criminal procedure judgment. The defendants Liu Luyin et al. murdered Yang Yongtai, the former Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, and this court has already sentenced them for their crimes. Yang Yongtai's wife, Yang Li Wuzhen, and his children, Yang Yixi et al., filed an incidental request before the end of the criminal case's debate to order Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Bozhou, and Cao Bingrong to jointly and severally compensate for support and consolation fees, which is in accordance with Article 491 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 185, Article 192, Paragraph 2, and Article 194 of the Civil Code. What should be examined is the amount of compensation. The compensation for support and consolation fees should take into account the living conditions of the victim's family, the mental pain they have suffered, and the perpetrator's financial resources as the basis for judgment. The plaintiffs in this case requested compensation for 118,560 yuan in support fees and 100,000 yuan in consolation money. Considering the living conditions of the plaintiffs and the degree of mental pain they have suffered, it is not too much. However, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Bozhou, and Cao Bingrong are all poor and have no property, and Liu Luyin is not wealthy either. This court considers the financial resources of Liu Luyin et al. and determines that Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Bozhou, and Cao Bingrong shall jointly and severally compensate the plaintiffs for damages of 20,000 yuan in support fees and 10,000 yuan in consolation fees. The remaining claims cannot be considered reasonable and should be dismissed. As for the criminal parts of the defendants Yang Xiaoming and Fan Qishu, they were not sentenced because they are fugitives. Since there is no criminal basis for the incidental civil compensation part of the defendants, the substantive judgment cannot be made, and the litigation proceedings should be suspended. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 506, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2, Article 495, Item 5 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and Article 183 of the Civil Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. June 5, 1937, Republic of China.

Liu Xianji, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Court of the Hubei Wuchang District Court; Judge Wang Zhaoji; Judge Yue Shutang. June of the 26th year of the Republic of China, Clerk Shuai Gujing accepted the book. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th)

Court Temporarily Bans Public Attendance

This case is attracting the most attention from the people of the country, who all want to understand the details of the case and the demeanor and statements of the seven gentlemen. The court's ban on public attendance was a temporary change, unknown beforehand. Therefore, before noon, those who went to wait for public attendance were already arriving in an endless stream. However, they saw a notice posted at the entrance of the court, which read: "The Criminal Division of this court, in accordance with Article 65 of the Court Organization Law, has resolved to suspend public attendance for the trial of Shen Junru and others for endangering the Republic. All issued attendance tickets are invalid. Please be informed."

After Several Negotiations, Some Flexibility is Allowed

A single attendance ticket was more precious than an arch-璧. Seeing this announcement, everyone was disappointed. The families of the defendants still stood in the wind and rain, which was a pitiful sight. This was noticed by Suzhou resident Zhang Zhongren, who resolutely stepped forward to find a way to work with Court President Zhu Shusheng. He managed to obtain permission for the families to attend. News reporters also negotiated several times and were allowed to sit in to record. Because of the special importance of the case, the lawyers temporarily requested four stenographers to record the testimony. All others holding attendance tickets were barred from the door.

Shen, Zou, and Others Appear Natural

Defendants Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, Sha Qianli, and Li Gongpu were detained in the branch of the High Court's detention center on Hengjie Street in Wuxian County. Defendants Shi Liang and Luo Qing were detained in the High Court's detention center on Siqian Street. They were transported by car from the High Court separately. At 11:30 a.m., the High Court sent three cars to pick up the defendants from the High Court Detention Center on Guwu Road. Shen Junru and Zhang Naiqi were in the first car. Sha Qianli and Li Gongpu were in the middle car. Zou Taofen and Wang Zaoshi were in the last car. They were followed by a public security bureau escort vehicle. After Shen, Zhang, and the six others arrived at the High Court, two cars went to the High Court Detention Center on Siqian Street to pick up Shi Liang and Luo Qing, and summoned Gu Liuxin and Ren Songgao, a total of ten people.

Twenty-Five Defense Lawyers

On this day, Zou and the others appeared natural. Zou wore a light-colored suit. Before the trial, he told people, "I will not hinder the patriotic action, nor will I do anything to damage my personality." Shen Junru wore a dark silk long gown and was in excellent spirits. Shi Liang had curly hair and bare arms, wearing a blue shirt with a white collar and a smile on her face. In short, everyone's demeanor remained unchanged, with no haggard or depressed look, which showed the preferential treatment in detention. There were a total of twenty-five defense lawyers. Two rows of seats were set up in the First Tribunal, with Qin Liankui in the chief seat. One thing is worth mentioning: Shen Junru stated before the trial that if the case was not tried publicly, he would refuse to speak and would accept any punishment. The fact that reporters and family members were allowed to attend yesterday was related to his remarks.

Reading the Indictment, Individual Interrogation

The bell rang twice to begin the trial. The presiding judge of the First Tribunal, Fang Wen, along with two judges and the prosecutor Weng Zannian, and the clerks, attended the court. The lawyers and defendants also entered in single file. First, Prosecutor Weng rose to read the indictment. After reading the indictment, Judge Fang also questioned each defendant about their age and place of origin. Except for the first interrogation of Shen Junru, the others were taken out of the courtroom for individual interrogation. Finally, after questioning Gu Liuxin, Ren Gao, and Luo Qing, he ordered the clerk to read the confession. It was already 8 p.m. The court ordered that the trial would resume at 1 p.m. on the 12th. Shen and the other eight were returned to detention, while Gu and Ren were released on bail.

The case of Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, etc., began its hearing at the Jiangsu High Court yesterday at 1 p.m. Military police lined the roads and conducted thorough inspections. The situation was very serious. Before 12 o'clock, the front of the court was already packed with crowds, blocking all passage. The court authorities, in order to prevent security risks, temporarily banned public attendance. Those who had already received attendance tickets were extremely disappointed. After several negotiations, family members were allowed to attend, but each defendant was limited to two people. The formal trial began at noon, and the atmosphere was quite tense. A total of twenty-seven lawyers appeared in court. The presiding judge was Wu Fangwen, and the jurors were Wang Jue and Zheng Chuanying. Then the defendants Shen et al. were brought to the court. The defendants all looked energetic and had smiles on their faces. After asking for their names, ages, and addresses, the prosecutor stated the reasons for the prosecution. The defendants were then dismissed from the court. First, Shen Junru was interrogated.

(Question) Have you ever sent Luo Qing to organize the Jiangsu National Salvation Association? (Answer) No. (Question) Do you have anything else to say? (Answer) It is very strange that the responsibility for the Xi'an Incident is placed on us. I myself am very strange. I would like to ask the presiding judge to call Zhang Xueliang to testify.

We advocate strengthening the regime and do not want to reorganize the government. (Question) Do you agree with one-party dictatorship? (Answer) I have no personal opinion, but I am in favor of constitutional government.

[Washington] After presenting his credentials to President Roosevelt today, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Wang Zhengting declared to the press that China is sympathetic to the proposal for a Pacific non-aggression pact proposed by Australian Prime Minister Lyons, and also very much agrees with the permanent neutralization of the Philippines. The Chinese people have been trading and marrying with Filipinos for hundreds of years, and they welcome the independence and autonomy of this sister country. As for the domestic situation in China, the unification in recent years has been completed and transportation has developed, which will greatly contribute to the peace of the Far East. As for President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull's Good Neighbor and Reciprocal Trade policies, the atmosphere of world peace has already been created. Today, countries around the world are working hard to adjust economic problems and reverse the scourge of war, and are following the lead of the United States. China has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population, which is of great importance to the development of world trade. Are we going to cooperate to promote international trade and stabilize the foundation of world peace? (National telegram on the 10th)

[Washington] China's new ambassador, Dr. Wang Zhengting, recently issued a statement to the newspapers, praising the peace policies currently being pursued by the U.S. government. He said that U.S. President Harding convened the Washington Conference in 1921, and former Secretary of State Kellogg initiated the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact in 1928. His successor, Secretary of State Stimson, advocated the doctrine of "non-recognition of land acquired by force" in 1932. Since President Roosevelt came to power, he has implemented the Good Neighbor policy, and the current Secretary of State Hull is also vigorously advocating the conclusion of reciprocal trade agreements with other countries. All of these are manifestations of the U.S. peace policy. In conclusion, Ambassador Wang expressed the hope that trade between China and the United States will develop day by day.

After welcoming the distinguished guests from China and Germany in his speech, he described the close cultural and economic relations between China and Germany, stating, "As far as the political relations between China and Germany are concerned, the treaty signed in 1931 on the basis of absolute equality has already started a new era. Since then, the relations between China and Germany have entered a realm of mutual understanding and sympathy. Although Germany has experienced difficult and arduous times after the World War, it has now rejoined the ranks of strong countries. The Chinese people expressed deep sympathy for Germany's difficult times, and today we are also very pleased with Germany's rapid recovery. In the past 20 years, China has also experienced major difficulties during the period of great reform. We are building a modern country in the old ruins of the old empire. This work is very difficult, and there are still various obstacles to be eliminated before reaching the goal. We believe that the German people who recall the history after the war must sympathize with China, because the environment China is currently encountering is the same as the environment Germany encountered after the war." Ambassador Cheng continued to describe the economic relations between China and Germany, believing that Germany is an industrialized country that needs raw materials and food, while China needs machinery from various countries to develop its natural resources. Therefore, China and Germany complement each other. The industrialization of China will enable German machinery and goods to obtain a larger market, and this close economic relationship will not only benefit China and Germany, but also help solve world economic problems. Ambassador Cheng also expressed his satisfaction with the close cultural relations between China and Germany, pointing out that there are more than 500 Chinese students studying at German universities, and expressed his belief that the integration of Chinese and German civilizations will produce great results in the near future. At this point, Ambassador Cheng recalled the contributions of the Chinese and German politicians participating in the banquet to China and Germany, hoping that the personal contact between the politicians of the two countries would enhance the friendship and cooperation between China and Germany.

### Unprecedented Import Excess in Japanese Trade

Gold Reserves Dwindling Annually, Authorities Vigorously Seek Remedies

[Tokyo] Japan's trade this year has experienced an unprecedented excess of imports, making the maintenance of a balanced international balance of payments the most serious problem at present. According to Japanese international trade history, in the seventy years of the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa periods, only eighteen years saw an excess of exports, namely thirteen years during Meiji and five years during Taisho. For the remaining fifty-two years of import surplus, the balance was mostly achieved by raising foreign debt. Trade improved relatively during the war, allowing Japan to have a gold reserve of ¥1,400,000,000 in addition to its trade income of ¥2,300,000,000. The total of this gold reserve and the original reserve amounted to ¥4,040,000,000. After the war, Japan's international trade reverted to a negative trend, and by 1923, a total of ¥2,387,000,000 in gold had flowed out, leaving only ¥1,653,000,000 in reserves. Although a significant amount of gold has flowed out over the past fourteen years, the foreign debt incurred by the Japanese government and people to maintain the yen exchange market still amounts to ¥121,000,000. In view of the fact that this year's import surplus will be higher than in any previous year, the Japanese government is attempting to collect gold, control gold production, and increase the purchase price of gold bars by the Bank of Japan in order to increase gold production in an effort to improve this situation. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan are considering other effective ways to collect gold from the public. According to statistics from the Bank of Japan, the total value of newly mined gold this year is ¥150,000,000, the amount that can be collected from the public is about ¥30,000,000, and the amount collected from Manchuria is about ¥15,000,000, for a total of ¥195,000,000. The bank also estimates that after 1923, the annual gold production from mainland Japan, Korea, and Taiwan can reach ¥300,000,000, while Manchuria alone can produce ¥100,000,000 after 1923, and ¥200,000,000 after five years. Therefore, according to this statistic, Japan will be able to obtain gold worth ¥500,000,000 annually after five years. The above indicates how eager the Japanese government is to resolve the difficulties encountered in balancing international payments. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 11th)

### Eight Soviet Army Generals Involved in Purge Movement Brought to Trial

All Confess to Being Traitors to the Party and the Country Without Reservation; Internal Strife in the Red Army Fully Exposed

[Moscow] Stalin's large-scale purge of the Red Army movement has begun today. Eight arrested high-ranking generals have been submitted to the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court for trial. The presiding judge is Ulrikh, who recently handled the Trotskyist reactionary case. The charges against each defendant are as follows: (1) betraying the party and the country; (2) providing Red Army intelligence to a certain country; (3) attempting to undermine the Red Army organization; (4) attempting to act as an internal accomplice when a certain country invades Soviet Russia, in order to restore capitalism. All eight defendants confessed without reservation to conspiring to overthrow Stalin's dictatorial government. All eight defendants are the backbone of the Red Army, including General Tukhachevsky, who served as Deputy People's Commissar of Defense and was a close aide to People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov. General Uborevich was the commander of the Belorussian Military District, General Kork was the commander of the Moscow Garrison, and General Yakir was the commander of the Ukrainian Military District. (National Telegram, 11th)

[Moscow] The Soviet government issued an announcement today stating that the investigation into the case of Tukhachevsky, Yakir, Uborevich, Kork, Eideman, Feldman, Primakov, and Putna, who were successively arrested by various agencies of the Internal Affairs Committee, has been completed and transferred to the court for trial. The aforementioned defendants are accused of violating their military oath (perjury), treason, betraying the Soviet people, and betraying the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. The investigation revealed that the defendants, together with Gamarnik, who had committed suicide out of fear of punishment, colluded with key military figures in a certain country unfriendly to the Soviet Union to engage in treasonous activities. The defendants were jointly employed by the military intelligence agency of a certain country, continuously providing secret Red Army information to key military figures in that country, engaging in sabotage activities to weaken the Red Army's power, attempting to cause the Red Army to collapse when the Soviet Union was subjected to armed attack, and jointly engaging in various activities with the aim of assisting landlords and capitalists to restore their power in the Soviet Union. All defendants have confessed to the above charges. The case is scheduled to be heard in a closed session by the Special Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union on June 11. The Chief Justice is Ulrikh, Chairman of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court. The jurors are Yakirnis, Deputy People's Commissar of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army Air Force, General Budyonny, General Blücher (i.e., Galen), Chief of the General Staff of the Red Army Shaposhnikov, Belov, Commander of the Belorussian Military District, Dybenko, Commander of the Leningrad Military District, Kashirin, Commander of the North Caucasus Military District, and Goryachev, Commander of the Sixth Cossack Corps of Stalingrad. (TASS Dispatch, 11th)

[Tokyo] Regarding the arrest of the eight top leaders of the Soviet Red Army, the views of the Japanese Army authorities are roughly as follows: The so-called Red Army conspiracy case is a manifestation of internal strife within the Red Army. In other words, opposition to People's Commissar of Defense General Voroshilov has resulted in this outcome. The so-called hardliners towards Germany have largely been denounced. Gamarnik, the First Deputy Commissar of Voroshilov, committed suicide earlier, and Tukhachevsky, the Second Deputy Commissar, has now been arrested. Therefore, there should be a considerable shock to the entire Red Army. In short, this is the first time that such a large-scale internal strife has occurred within the Red Army since the Russian Revolution. (Domei Dispatch, 11th)

### Brief Biographies of Arrested Red Army Leaders

[Moscow] The Military Collegium of the Supreme Court will begin hearing the case today concerning the betrayal of the country by former Chief of the General Staff of the Army, General Tukhachevsky, and seven other generals. The defendants are accused of violating their military duty, colluding with military personnel from a country unfriendly to the Soviet Union, and engaging in treasonous activities. According to the law promulgated on December 1, 1934, the defendants shall be sentenced to death unless declared innocent. The biographies of the main defendants are listed below:

㊀ General Tukhachevsky, originally a soldier, was captured by the German army during the European War. Later, he served as the commander of the First and Fifth Armies on the Eastern Front of Russia. In 1920, he commanded the Red Army in the war against Poland. In 1923, he quelled the naval rebellion in Kronstadt. In recent years, he has successively served as a member of the Central Executive Committee, Deputy People's Commissar of Defense, Deputy Chairman of the Defense Council, and Chief of the General Staff of the Army. He was recently transferred to the position of Commander of the Volga Military District, but was arrested before taking up his new post.

㊁ Defendant Yakir, 41 years old, joined the Communist Party in 1917. He organized the Red Guards and participated in the campaign against General Denikin in White Russia. In 1930, he was promoted to a member of the Revolutionary Military Council. He was recently transferred to the position of Commander of the Leningrad Military District, but was arrested shortly after taking office, along with Deputy Commander Primakov.

㊂ Defendant Uborevich came from a peasant family and joined the Communist Party in 1917. He also led troops to suppress Generals Denikin and Wrangel in White Russia. In 1922, when Japanese and White Russian troops invaded the Russian Far Eastern provinces, General Uborevich led his troops to repel them. He was later promoted to Deputy People's Commissar of Defense. He was recently arrested while serving as Commander of the Belorussian Military District.

㊃ Defendant Eideman, 42 years old, joined the Communist Party in 1917. He engaged in revolutionary work in Siberia and participated in the campaigns against Generals Denikin and Wrangel in White Russia. He is currently the president of the Chemical Aviation Society.

㊄ Defendant Putna was originally the military attaché at the British Embassy. He was recently arrested on suspicion of participating in the Trotskyist counter-revolutionary case. The Communist Party's newspaper "Pravda" stated that the arrest of Tukhachevsky and others shows that the spy agencies organized by the bourgeoisie have failed and that the effectiveness of the Soviet intelligence agencies has increased. All Soviet people should examine themselves and not unintentionally leak state secrets. (Central News Agency, Havana, 11th)

Monitoring Plan Seeks to Restore Original State; Warring Parties in Spain Expected to Accept

[London] Regarding the issue of guaranteeing the safety of warships from various countries undertaking surveillance work in the Western Mediterranean, Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to hold a meeting with the ambassadors of France, Germany, and Italy at the Foreign Office tomorrow at 3:00 PM to draft the full text of a four-nation agreement on the implementation of safety guarantees.

Therefore, drafting the agreement at tomorrow's meeting should not be difficult. In addition, Ribbentrop and Grandi held a long meeting today, and it is reported that they have agreed to support the drafting of a four-nation agreement in accordance with the following content: ㊀ Outline the incidents that have occurred in the past few weeks, considering it necessary to prevent them from happening again. ㊁ Advise the Valencia Republican government and the Salamanca Nationalist authorities to further expand the "safe areas" that both sides have already accepted in principle. ㊂ Declare that if either party in the Spanish civil war attacks any national warship participating in maritime surveillance in the future, it shall be deemed by the participating countries as a joint attack on those countries. Should such an incident occur, the four countries of England, France, Germany, and Italy shall immediately conduct mutual consultations to determine appropriate defensive measures, but such consultations shall not exclude the right of the warships of the participating countries to self-defense. ㊃ Once the replies from the parties involved in the Spanish civil war are received, the Non-Intervention Committee for Spain shall convene a meeting, and Germany and Italy shall also send representatives to participate again to approve the four-nation agreement. General observers strongly assert that the main goal of this agreement is to restore the original state of the monitoring plan. As for the proposal put forward by France to send neutral observers to inspect the warships of participating countries, it can be seriously considered by the Adjustments Committee at that time. It is heard that the British Admiralty originally opposed the French proposal, but Foreign Secretary Eden supported it without reservation, and the Admiralty finally relented. (Central News Agency, Le Havre Dispatch, 10th)

[London] It is generally expected that the Spanish government can accept in principle the proposal regarding the protection of monitoring warships, although there may be some reservations. The Spanish government will probably require that German and Italian warships no longer engage in actions such as the bombardment of Almeria. As for the Nationalist forces, there may not be any objections. (Reuters Dispatch, 10th)

### Stalemate Between Armies in Northern Spain

Both Sides Wait for Opportunity to Attack; Major Battle Imminent

Bobinan: Spanish government Defense Minister Prieto declared to the Associated Press today that since taking office, he has arranged military preparations to launch a general offensive to relieve the siege of Bilbao. The government army will soon reach 500,000 men, fully trained militarily. As it stands, the government army is stronger in numbers, while the rebels have the advantage in military equipment, command, and soldier training. My mission is to train elite troops to safeguard Spain's democratic system. Now, discipline and combat effectiveness have greatly improved in the new army, and the rebels' military equipment, though advanced, will inevitably fail. (National Telegram, 10th)

Seville: Several government aircraft suddenly flew over here at dawn today, carrying out an attack that killed eight and injured seventy-two. This move may be a prelude to a major counter-offensive by the government army. (National Telegram, 10th)

Saint-Jean-de-Luz: An Argentine observer telephoned the Associated Press from the Biscay front in northern Spain today, stating that the rebel army's military preparations for a general offensive on Bilbao have been completed. If the weather clears, action may begin tomorrow morning. At that time, 180 aircraft and 50,000 ground troops will participate in the offensive, intending to break through the fortified lines outside Bilbao in one fell swoop. Rebel Commander-in-Chief Franco is determined to capture Bilbao with all his strength, so military operations on other fronts are temporarily suspended to allow this area to succeed before moving troops to attack the capital. However, due to heavy rains in recent days, the trenches in the mountains are deeply flooded, making it impossible for the two armies to engage in bayonet charges. (National Telegram, 10th)

### German-Bulgarian Talks Conclude

Seeking Cooperation from Balkan Countries; German Foreign Minister Arrives in Hungarian Capital from Bulgaria

Bulgarian Capital: German Foreign Minister Neurath recently held talks with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov. A communiqué was issued afterward, with rather vague wording, merely stating that the two discussed European peace and various diplomatic issues related to both countries, and the result proved that the two sides' opinions were completely identical. "As for the existing cooperation projects between Germany and Bulgaria in the economic and cultural fields, they should be expanded." Commentators generally believe that Neurath's visit will not lead to any changes in Bulgaria's current foreign policy. (Central News Agency, Le Havre Dispatch, 10th)

Hungarian Capital: The semi-official Hungarian Telegraph Agency recently issued a message stating that German Foreign Minister Neurath, after visiting Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, is scheduled to arrive in the Hungarian capital this afternoon and stay for four days. "The friendship between Hungary and Germany has always been harmonious, and this trip will surely be beneficial to international peace." (Central News Agency, Le Havre Dispatch, 11th)

[Berlin] Newspapers here extensively discussed the significance of Neurath's visit to the Balkan countries. The Münchner Neueste Nachrichten stated that the purpose of Neurath's visit is to consolidate peace in the Balkans and Central Europe. Consolidating peace is Germany's policy towards Southeast Europe. It also stated that not only have friendly relations developed between Yugoslavia and Hungary, but also the relations between Bulgaria and the Balkan countries have recently improved. Mutual hostility has gradually turned into mutual cooperation. Yugoslavia is a strong bulwark against Bolshevism in Central and Southern Europe, and Bulgaria, after restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, has been greatly disappointed and has taken strict measures to prevent Soviet conspiracies.

### Polish President Returns to Warsaw

Warsaw: President Mościcki, who recently visited Romania, has completed his official duties and returned here. General Ryż-Śmigły, Inspector General of the Armed Forces, and cabinet members went to the station to greet him, and the crowds on the streets paid their respects to the President. (Central News Agency, Le Havre Dispatch, 10th)

Vatican City: The Vatican's newspaper, "L'Osservatore Romano," recently published a commentary on the Polish President's visit to Romania, stating, "The policies of Poland and Romania both have an anti-Bolshevik nature. If the friendship between these two countries can be strengthened, it will greatly benefit the anti-Red front in Europe." Referring to German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, it stated that it was an important move by Germany to expand its influence in the Balkan Peninsula. Germany and Italy are excellent customers for Yugoslavia's exports and supporters of Hungary's revision of treaties and rearmament. Now, Germany intends to promote closer relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 10th)

### Heat Wave in Berlin

Unprecedented in Eighty Years; Snow Melting in the Alps

[Berlin] Berlin is scorching hot today, having reached 36 degrees Celsius, equivalent to 97 degrees Fahrenheit. In the eighty-year history of the German Meteorological Bureau, it has broken yesterday's record of 95 degrees and set a new one. As a result of this extraordinary heat, even the "year-round snow" in the Alps has begun to melt. (Note: Berlin's summer climate is usually below 90 degrees.) The city government has hired 3,350 additional street cleaners for sweeping the streets. The amount of water used for cleaning yesterday alone was 16,000 cubic meters, worth 2,400 marks. The daily wages of the street cleaners amounted to a huge 30,000 marks. (National Shipping Telegram, 11th)

### Japan Plans to Cooperate with China on Drug Prohibition

Japanese Establish Heroin Factories in Tianjin; Estimate of Two Hundred Factories Considered Exaggerated

[Tokyo] The League of Nations Opium Committee believes that it is necessary to crack down on the private trafficking of white powder in North China. It stated that it had received reports that the number of heroin factories operated by Japanese in Tianjin reached two hundred, and that the amount of heroin shipped out each week reached 500 kilograms. Therefore, it resolved as follows: The Japanese government should be asked to crack down on Japanese nationals privately manufacturing and secretly selling opium in China. As for the methods for cracking down on the manufacture and private trafficking of opium, the Chinese and Japanese governments should cooperate in handling them. The Japanese government has not yet received a public announcement regarding this matter, but believes that the above figures are exaggerated. According to international treaties, the prohibition of opium smoking and its manufacture and trafficking have long been strictly prohibited, and the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Justice will impose even stricter penalties for prohibiting opium and drug trafficking. The relevant amendment is being drafted, so the purpose of the League of Nations' resolution can be understood. As for the issue of drug prohibition, it should not hesitate to assist the National Government. In accordance with its policy of gradually reducing opium addiction, "Manchukuo" is changing opium cultivation to state-run operations in order to strive to limit its production. At the same time, it is seeking treatment methods, and the number of people who have completely recovered from addiction each year reaches 700. (Domei News Agency, 11th)

[Tokyo] The Opium Advisory Committee of the League of Nations passed a resolution on the 10th of this month, requesting the Japanese government to take effective measures as soon as possible to crack down on Japanese nationals privately manufacturing and trafficking drugs in China. Upon hearing this news, people here took a lukewarm attitude. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared this morning that he had not yet received a report from Masayuki Yokoyama, the Japanese representative to the Opium Advisory Committee of the League of Nations. Since Japan is a signatory to the 1936 agreement prohibiting the manufacture and sale of drugs, it has the obligation to manage all illegal manufacturing and trafficking of drugs. In fact, the Japanese government is currently considering amending existing laws prohibiting drugs that can also be applied to Japanese nationals in China to make them even stricter. Regarding the matter of drugs in North China, the spokesman directly admitted that if Japanese factories in Tianjin manufacture hydrochloric acid, the hydrochloric acid can not only be used to make heroin, but also for manufacturing rayon and aircraft essentials. (Central News Agency, 11th)

### International Labour Conference

Chinese Representative Speaks, Requesting a Council Seat

[Geneva] The International Labour Conference continued its general debate at 10:00 AM today. Li Pingheng, the Chinese government representative, delivered a speech, stating that although there are signs of economic recovery in the world, it is caused by the expansion of armaments by various countries and is actually superficial. Li then elaborated on the labour conferences held repeatedly in countries outside of Europe, such as the regional labour conference held last year in Santiago, Chile, and the conference held this year in Washington by labour and management representatives from the textile industry in various countries, as well as government representatives. He also stated that the Indian representative to the International Labour Conference proposed in 1931 that governments, labour, and management representatives from various Asian countries should hold a consultative conference, which China has endorsed. This proposal is under consideration by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and China is still willing to endorse it. He then listed the measures taken by the Chinese government in social undertakings, stating that only four non-permanent council seats in the Governing Body of the International Labour Office are held by countries outside of Europe, of which Asian countries occupy only one seat. He specifically requested a fair distribution so that China can be granted one seat in this year's re-election. (Central News Agency, Le Havre Dispatch, 11th)

### Textile Industry Committee Passes Forty-Hour Work Week

Employer Representatives Vote Against

[Geneva] The Textile Industry Working Hours Committee of the International Labour Conference recently passed a resolution to implement a forty-hour work week in the textile industry by a majority of sixteen votes to nine, with one abstention. Government representatives from all countries except Japan, England, and Canada voted in favour. Labour representatives from all countries also voted in favour. As for employer representatives from various countries, all voted against except for France, which abstained. The International Labour Conference is currently organizing a special adjustment committee so that the provisions on the implementation of the forty-hour work week in the textile industry can be harmonized with the provisions on working hours in other industries such as the chemical industry. In addition, the committee of the International Labour Conference dealing with the minimum working age recently submitted the issue of special systems implemented in China, Japan, and India to discussion. Following a proposal by Chinese government representative Bao Huaguo, it was decided to submit the entire issue of the minimum working age to discussion and entrust the Presidium to informally exchange views with representatives from countries most closely related to the Far East.

### Belgian Prime Minister to Visit France and Then the United States

Removing Trade Barriers; Conducting Investigative Work

Brussels: Prime Minister Zillan left for Paris at 4:00 PM today to board a ship in the French port of Cherbourg tomorrow afternoon to go to the United States. Although Belgian officials stated that this trip was purely private in nature, it is generally believed that after England and France previously entrusted Prime Minister Zillan to engage in economic investigative work (namely, regarding the removal of international trade barriers), Prime Minister Zillan immediately ordered economic expert Ferrer to collect various economic intelligence and personally discussed matters with French Foreign Minister Daladier, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and German Economics Minister Schacht. Upon arriving in the United States, he will certainly hold talks with President Roosevelt to make contributions to the world economy. Therefore, Prime Minister Zillan's true purpose of this trip is to complete the large-scale investigative work that he has already begun in Europe. As for the claim that Prime Minister Zillan intends to convene a world economic conference, it is likely not accurate, and he himself has repeatedly denied it. (Central News Agency, Le Havre Dispatch, 11th)

### Serious Situation in American Steel Industry Labor Strike

Strikers Clash with Police

Monroe, Michigan – The Michigan steel industry labor strike erupted into a major riot today. Approximately 500 non-striking workers, along with 300 police officers, lined up near the Newton Steel Company, ultimately outnumbering and dispersing the picket line by a margin of six to one. At 6:10 PM, they deployed a large number of tear gas canisters and used brickbats as weapons to escort several non-striking workers into the factory to work. Industrial Organizations Committee representative McBrearty was chased by six men, forced into a nearby house, compelled to raise his hands, and driven out. Thousands of onlookers were also affected by the tear gas. Many women screamed and sought refuge in neighboring houses. The picketers were forced to retreat, and another group of strike breakers went to the steel mill's nearby picket headquarters and set it on fire, causing significant damage. At least 300 people were injured by tear gas, and many others were struck by clubs. At least six people were admitted to the hospital tonight for treatment. Three people were arrested. (National Telegram, 10th)

Pontiac, Michigan – Following yesterday's clash between striking workers at the Newton Steel Mill in Monroe, this state, and the police, the executive committee of the United Automobile Workers Union has issued an order to all its members to immediately hold a sympathy strike for 24 hours.

### A Certain Party Exploiting White Russians to Cause Disturbances

Over Two Hundred People Trained by a Certain Party – Secretly Sent to Peiping, Tientsin and Both Railway Lines to Conduct Activities

Tientsin dispatch – A certain party recently took in over two hundred White Russian petty criminals who had fled to Tientsin and, after training them, sent them to Peiping, Tientsin, and along the Peiping-Suiyuan and Peiping-Hankou railways to secretly carry out disruptive plans. Discoveries have already been made in the Dongchanminxiang area of Peiping. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council is paying close attention to this and has scheduled a meeting in Peiping on the 15th of this month, bringing together responsible individuals from the municipal governments of Peiping and Tientsin, the Peiping-Suiyuan and Peiping-Hankou railway administrations, the Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee, and the authorities of the Tientsin concessions to discuss preventive measures. According to investigations, there are approximately one thousand of these White Russians scattered in the First, Third, and Second Special Districts (i.e., the former German and Russian concessions). Less than one-fifth of these White Russians are employed; most serve as musicians in dance halls, chefs in taverns, and vendors of soap and felt. The rest are idle, and many of the women have become prostitutes. In particular, there are dozens of White Russian brothels in the Zhifou Road area of the First Special District, with over two hundred Russian prostitutes, and countless others secretly engaging in prostitution. As for unemployed White Russians, aside from a few weak ones who beg for survival at train stations and wharves, the rest have turned to theft. There are approximately three hundred of these thieves, with organization and leaders. Each crime requires three or four people, and their targets are mostly foreign residences in the British, French, and Italian concessions. Chinese residences and shops are rarely visited. Using counterfeit money and forging postage stamps are their ancillary activities. Last month, the Peiping police cracked a counterfeit postage stamp case, and White Russian nationals Song Gulov and others were escorted to Tientsin and sentenced to three years in prison by the Tientsin court. This is one example. In January of this year, the British concession authorities in Tientsin cracked several cases involving White Russian thieves, all of whom were handed over to the Tientsin Municipal Police Bureau and then to the courts for legal punishment. At that time, the Tientsin Municipal Government, noting the large number of stateless foreigners in the city, who were committing crimes due to the lack of livelihood, affecting local security, specifically ordered the Police Bureau and the public offices of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Special Districts to conduct a thorough investigation of stateless foreigners and to order those who were unemployed and engaged in illegal activities to leave the country. Coincidentally, the Soviet Russian Consulate in Tientsin also sent an official document to our side, requesting that action be taken against unemployed White Russians. From then on, the hundreds of members of White Russian theft gangs in Tientsin had no place to stand. Seeing this, a certain party believed that there was an opportunity to be exploited and continued to provide conveniences to the White Russians, using the same methods as when raising Chinese traitors. In March of this year, a certain party recruited over two hundred White Russian thieves, providing each with a small daily living allowance and sending people to give them strict training. As of now, a portion, about one hundred people, have completed their training and are carrying out disruptive missions, secretly heading to Peiping, plotting wrongdoing. Fortunately, our side received the report early and took precautions. However, the insidious intentions of that certain party should not be ignored for a moment. (9th)

### After the Failure of the Self-Defense of the People of Northern Chahar, They Suffer Severely

A Certain Party Convenes a Meeting to Implement High-Pressure Tactics – Arbitrarily Implicating and Reinforcing Troops in Chongli County

Zhangbei dispatch – After the people of northern Chahar recently rose up in self-defense, originally intending to fight for a glimmer of hope in a situation of utter despair, their ambitions were thwarted, and a certain party became aware and prepared. The recent situation is akin to water becoming deeper and fire becoming hotter. Not a few have sacrificed their lives and property. Now, in order to ensure that the people of northern Chahar will not stage another uprising, a certain party has consulted with the rebel group and decided to implement high-pressure tactics to eradicate all traces. According to people who came from Jiabusi Temple on the 8th of this month, the head of a certain special service agency has been consulting with De Wang and other rebel leaders since the 1st of this month to search for and arrest the resistance elements who were not captured during this popular uprising, with the aim of eradicating all traces. They are also plotting to eliminate those who are brewing plans to rise up again, preventing them from even germinating. According to reports, the results of the consultations are as follows: ㊀ Strictly investigate and arrest anti-puppet elements in all areas (illegal areas such as northern Chahar), ensuring that none are missed. Village and town chiefs and neighbors are responsible for mutually reporting and exposing each other, and the system of collective responsibility is implemented. ㊁ Resolutely protect local security, with the puppet military and political chiefs stationed in each area being responsible for ensuring that the popular uprising of June 1st does not occur again. ㊂ Use large sums of money to purchase a large number of Chinese traitors, dispersing them to various areas and infiltrating Zhangjiakou to investigate all actions of anti-puppet elements, or attempt to stop their activities, or induce them to leak secrets from behind the scenes, persuading them to join the puppet regime to make the anti-puppet forces dissipate invisibly. If necessary, even resort to assassination. In addition, regarding the issue of invading western Suiyuan, because a certain party is focusing all its attention on implementing the work of tormenting the people of northern Chahar, it has no time for other plans and has decided not to take active action against western Suiyuan in the near future. The righteous people of Taogaimiao Village (i.e., Tuolagai Temple Village), Zhao Xiangchun, Tian Xing, and others, were the first to rise up in self-defense, and people in various areas rose up in response, posing a major obstacle to a certain party and the puppet bandits' invasion of Suiyuan, stirring the once depressed and fearful hearts of the people of northern Chahar. Although it did not achieve significant success, it was enough to expose the true image of the people's unwillingness to submit. Now, after the incident, a certain party is extremely concerned with intimidating the people in various areas. First, it sent rebel Li Shouxin to sit in Zhangbei. Furthermore, because the situation in Chongli County is not very important, it ordered the relocation to the strategically important area of Xiwancun. Now, fearing that the security team and police in the county are weak, on the 7th of this month, it ordered more than four hundred soldiers (approximately one regiment) of the puppet Fourth Division of Bao Guiting, stationed in Zhangbei County, to arrive and garrison Xiwancun. The special service agency of a certain party issued a general order to the garrison and police teams in Kangbao, Binchan, Duolun, Shangdu, and other counties to strictly implement preventive measures. The special service agency of a certain party deeply hates the righteous people Zhao Xiangchun and Tian Xing for killing Wang Yaoguang, the chief of the Taogaimiao Village Public Security Bureau, and confiscating the puppet police's firearms. It ordered the puppet Chongli County Government to confiscate and seize all the family property of the righteous people and have it auctioned off by the puppet government, using the money obtained as compensation for the family of the rebel Wang Yaoguang and the families of the slain police officers. On the 6th of this month, the puppet Chongli County Government specially invited representatives from the Zhangbei and other county governments to hold a memorial service at the Taogaimiao Village Public Security Branch to mourn the rebel Wang Yaoguang and others who had been publicly killed, in order to encourage surviving traitors. Furthermore, Ma has inherited the puppet position left by Yaoguang. (June 8th)

Old cotton goods have also risen by 2-3 cents, with each bale selling for over 18-19 yuan. Hemp sells for 6.2 yuan. Vegetables were only worth 9 yuan at the close, but have now risen to 9.5 yuan. It is feared that prices will continue to rise after the Dragon Boat Festival.

Jiang Tianyi of Liuhe Encircles and Suppresses Bandits

The Jiangdu County Government, on the 10th, because more than forty bandits with complete firearms were discovered at the border between Yizheng and Liuhe, fled north from Tongjiaji. After being pursued and suppressed by the Jizheng cavalry, they were forced into the Caomiaoshan Yinjiawa area of Tianchang, which is connected to the county. Fortunately, the security team stationed in Yiju Village in the Eighth District of this county pursued and suppressed them. They fled again to the Fanjiaji area in the Zhonghe Second District, and upon seeing the deployment of defenses in the area, they fled to the Dajing Zhao area, robbing the wealthy household Xu Zhenggu of property and leading away four mules. Also, because the Tianchang Self-Defense Regiment assisted in the suppression, the bandits fled west again. Fearing that the borders of the southwest townships of this county, which are adjacent to the three counties of Yi, Liu, and Tian, would be invaded and harassed by bandits, in addition to dispatching the provincial security team stationed in this county to intercept, they also dispatched hundreds of county police team leaders, police instructors, and police, dividing them into four large teams, to go to the southwest townships and areas adjacent to the three counties of Yi, Liu, and Tian to conduct a major search and suppression in conjunction with the military and police of neighboring counties. They have been departing from the city in succession since 3:00 PM on the 10th.

### A Bird's-Eye View of Ziliujing

— Geng Ya

After arriving in Ziliujing from Neijiang, I immediately inquired with local people about the various situations of the salt wells. The next day, I drew up an itinerary and went to visit them.

Regarding the types of wells, they are generally divided into three types: water wells, fire wells, and water-fire wells. Those that produce salt springs are called water wells, those that produce fire are called fire wells, and those that produce both water and fire are called water-fire wells. Further analysis reveals that there are also wells that only produce "rock salt," which should be called rock salt wells, or those that produce a small amount of petroleum, which can also be referred to as petroleum wells. Ziliujing is divided into upper and lower plants, also called "Zi Well" and "Gong Well." The total number of wells is estimated to be about 1,400. Except for those that are abandoned and not in operation, only half of them are now active wells. Among them, fire wells account for the majority, followed by water-fire wells, and water wells and rock wells are in the minority. Petroleum wells are still unnoticed. As for what kind of well to dig, there is no scientific identification method, so-called "extracting treasures from the earth" is not only unpredictable, whether it is fire or water, but often after digging to a depth of about 300 zhang, there is still nothing. This is of course terrible. Who will be the owner of this new well, at least 50,000 yuan or more must be sacrificed.

The method of drilling wells is to use a large iron file that is four or five inches thick and about one zhang long. Use several extremely flexible and long bamboo strips to firmly tie it, and lower it into the well. Then, using manpower or ox power, turn the wheels tied to the bamboo strips to chisel up and down, attacking the center of the earth layer by layer. After a considerable amount of mud has been chiseled, use a tin tube with a live cover embedded at the bottom to replace the file and absorb the mud from the well. It takes about 20 minutes for each time you change the tube and draw mud up and down. It can be seen that the depth of the well is very deep. In the future, if the well drilling is successful and salt water is extracted, even if a machine is used to draw it, it will still take about ten minutes each time. The various colors of rock formations passed through during well drilling, as well as the depth at which they are located, must be recorded in detail in the "Rock Mouth Book" for research and repair reference.

The moment when water and fire are seen during well drilling is commonly known as "seeing merit - the mineral layer formed by Ziliujing salt, the location recorded in the rock mouth book of each root salt well" is probably similar. The color of the salt spring is divided into yellow, black and other types. Yellow water is between tens of zhang and one hundred seventy or eighty zhang. At a depth of two hundred fifty or sixty zhang, it is black water, and salt rock is also mostly around two hundred sixty zhang. Fire wells are deeper than this, some reaching more than three hundred zhang, but on average, two hundred eighty zhang or so is the most promising. If no merit is seen after drilling to three hundred twenty zhang, it must be stopped. However, the well drillers are afraid that the well owner will stop work, causing them to lose their jobs. There are even secret drillings to two hundred forty or fifty zhang, but still nothing is gained, which proves that water and fire have a certain temperature, and it is useless if it is too little or too much.

Generally speaking, the salinity of the salt spring is heavier if the well is deep and lighter if it is shallow. Yellow water is lightly salty, and black water is heavily salty. The yellow water at a depth of one hundred thirty zhang may be the Yellow Spring referred to by the ancients as "no seeing each other without reaching the Yellow Spring." The salt content is about one tael and one or two qian per bowl (about twelve taels in weight, which is a specially made standard measuring instrument made of bamboo tube). The yellow water at one hundred fifty or sixty zhang is about one tael and five or six qian per bowl. When drilling to two hundred zhang, there is gradually fire, and black water is also gradually present beyond two hundred zhang, with more than two taels or even two taels and four or five per bowl. Salt rock is even saltier than black water, which is very salty natural salt, but it is deeply hidden under the "Yellow Spring," and it is impossible to bring it to the surface in large pieces like digging a coal mine!

The top layer of salt rock is cyan, about three or four chi thick. The second layer is white like alum, and the thickness varies from five to six chi. The third layer is pink, but the thickness is no more than one chi. It is impossible to dig them out in large pieces, so you have to use water to dissolve them first, and then suck them up. The cyan salt rock contains 40% salt, the white contains 60-70%, and the red contains as much as 90%. On average, each bowl of rock water can yield three taels and six. Ziliujing has several ponds of water, which are stored after rain. That kind of green-black appearance is very useful and valuable there. A pond of fire always sells for hundreds of yuan, because it is borrowed to dissolve rock salt.

The machine for drawing salt water can draw it once every ten minutes, and can draw a total of eight or nine hundred dan per day. Each dan of water has 396 bowls, which is equivalent to 297 jin. The salt content depends on the composition of the salt water. There is a very surging well water that is drawn day and night with an iron cylinder that can draw a thousand jin. The salt content is that every thousand jin of water can boil a hundred jin of salt. The fastening wire used for the machine to draw the cylinder costs 5,000 yuan per strand, but because it is easily broken every day, it is still not as cost-effective as using bamboo strips. However, bamboo strips are only suitable for slow-turning ox carts, not for fast-turning machines. It is said that Germany also has a method of dissolving rock salt with water and sucking it up with a pump, so that the water flows continuously. The rock layers in Ziliujing are too deep. Whether it is possible to suck it up with a pump is being considered and tested.

The fire of the fire well is a kind of natural gas (i.e., gas). It must be lit with another fire to make a "bang" sound, emitting a red and green glow with extremely high heat. The situation is similar to a gas stove. I visited a water-fire well. The wellhead continuously draws salt water, and gas also automatically volatilizes from the same bottom of the well. When it reaches about one or two zhang at the wellhead, it is connected to the kitchen through a dark pipe, and branches can be used to boil dozens to hundreds of salt pots. In this way, water and fire complement each other, which is really infinitely beneficial. If the fire is large but the salt water produced is very little, or even no salt water is produced, it is very cost-effective to buy water from other wells to boil. Assuming that charcoal is used to boil salt, the time and expense are very uneconomical, so those with water but no fire are also happy to sell their water. However, the great profit lies in the fact that fire is more plentiful than water after all.

The source of fire wells is petroleum or other minerals stored in the rock layers, which are gasified into natural gas deep underground due to the pressure of added water and the permanent steaming of geothermal heat. Once a well is drilled to it, it will gush out continuously. As for a fire well, the firepower will gradually weaken after about 30 years. In addition, the air temperature outside the well increases every year in summer, and the evaporation of fire increases, which weakens its own pressure and reduces the upward flow of the well fire, so the flame must be affected. If rainwater overflows into the rock crevices, the well fire will also be temporarily reduced or stopped. Conversely, if the temperature drops in winter, the fire will be very strong. Because it can be transported to other places, some people have designed to compress it with high pressure and store it in steel tanks for use in buses and other engines. Another example is Pu Ba, which contains several chemical elements. Unfortunately, most people only know how to use it to make tofu pudding. If it can be used to develop industry, how great will its effect be? The reserves of kerosene are not very rich, and it can probably be extracted from coal.

According to the salt well owners, the current output and sales have been worse than each other for two years. In the past, at the peak period, the upper and lower plants opened more than 1,400 wells, and the number of workers reached about 200,000. Now the number of wells extracted has been reduced to one-half, and workers have lost their jobs one after another and have been displaced. The main reasons belong to the subjective ones: (1) The manufacturers lack capital, and once they fall, they cannot recover. (2) As soon as the source of fire wells is slightly stronger, people will measure the situation and drill new wells to steal or cut off his fire veins. There are no special rules to restrict the result, and many people kill and defeat each other. The objective reasons are the main fatal injuries: (1) Heavy taxes (2) Reduced sales. The previous sales were in the two provinces of Guizhou and Hunan, especially in Hunan, with annual sales of 3,000 loads (each load weighs 108,000 jin). Manufacturers self-fry and self-transport, and there is no profit of three times. After the Republic of China, there were frequent wars in Sichuan, and military needs were urgent. "Yin" (i.e., salt transport permits) were used to offset the merchants' money. Each Yin, which was originally worth more than 5,000 yuan, was sold at a reduced price of about 2,000 yuan. Moreover, imitating the method of pre-collecting grain tax in the 60s of the Republic of China, the Yin for the next few years were sold. Others with backgrounds, general merchants, bought this Yin at a low price and obtained the exclusive right to transport and sell it, so they hoarded and did not transport enough the number of loads that should be sold, resulting in piles of goods in the producing area and successive bankruptcies. The demand for sales exceeded the supply, and the price of salt rose steadily, so the number of people who ate bland food increased day by day.

### Kong Chen Talked Between Berlin and Shanghai Yesterday

First Ask About the Recent Financial Situation in China, Concerned About Relieving the Silver Coins in Guangdong and Guangxi

Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy of our country to the coronation ceremony of King George VI of England, spoke with Chen Xing, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, in Berlin yesterday afternoon. Kong first inquired about the recent financial situation in China. Chen replied that it was generally good. Although there were minor disturbances in the exchanges during the day, they have gradually stabilized. Kong then inquired about the silver coins in Guangdong and Guangxi, expressing that relief measures should be determined as soon as possible, and inquired eagerly when Song Ziwen, a Standing Committee member of the National Economic Council, would go to Guangdong. Chen replied that Song would set off soon. Finally, Kong asked when the Qiu Jiang Wharf would open. Chen replied that it would be officially opened when the ship on which the special envoy returned docked. Due to the needs of the current situation, it is scheduled to be used first on the 12th of this month. At that time, domestic ships will dock first, and then the Japanese Queen's wheel will dock.

### Du Yuesheng's Great Efforts to Mediate Resulted in the Opening of the Yarn and Cloth Market Yesterday Morning

Agreed that the market price below the red card will be maintained for five days. After the opening, the yarn prices for each month have fallen uniformly. The actual supervisor who will come to Shanghai in the future requested instructions from the Ministry by telegram.

Since the Hua Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange's bid for yarn market prices rose to an unprecedented level, the market was in chaos. The shorts were greatly losing money due to difficulties in pursuing evidence, so they specially requested Du Yuesheng to mediate. After negotiating, the bid for yarn market prices fell below the red card and will be maintained for five days, after which the price will rise and fall freely. After the market reopened yesterday morning, the prices of the upper and lower plates gradually fell, and people's hearts gradually stabilized. The total amount of yarn traded was more than 138,000 pieces. The actual official Cheng Tiangu was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai this morning due to important matters in Beijing to conduct a thorough investigation. Wang Xiaolai, the supervisor of the exchange, telegraphed the Ministry of Industry for instructions. The details are as follows:

Broker Association's Fierce Debate

At 8:30 yesterday morning, Shao Wenmei, the Chairman of the Broker Association, first exchanged views with Mu Ouchu, the Chairman of the Exchange, and Wen Lanting, the Managing Director. At 9:05, he convened an emergency meeting of all brokers in the auditorium. Chairman Shao Wenmei reported the process of Du Yuesheng's mediation. The shorts requested a reduction of 10 yuan in the bidding price of the red card at the close of the 8th, while the longs only allowed a concession of four or five yuan. The interests of both parties were opposite, and a fierce debate broke out at the meeting. The chairman of the meeting could not control the situation, and advised the long and short brokers to rest for five minutes. Shao Wenmei then went to the Board of Directors to discuss with Mu Wen and other directors, and then reported the situation to Du on the phone and asked him to mediate again. It was not until 10:45 that he returned to the meeting to announce the agreed solution. However, a small number of brokers who were long on the market still insisted on not giving in due to the large loss of profits. Afterwards, the chairman explained that it was to follow Du's mediation and handled according to the agreed solution. Then it was submitted to the General Assembly for a vote, and it was unanimously approved by the entire audience.

Maintain Five Days Below the Red Card

After Du Yuesheng accepted the brokers' request, he used his personal status to persuade Xu Maochang and other giants on the long side. After several explanations, the long side followed Du's enthusiasm for mediation and accepted the two solutions in order to maintain the overall situation of the market: (1) The opening market price will be reduced by 4.5 yuan in accordance with the red card standard at the close of the market on June 8. (2) This solution will be maintained for five days from June 11 to June 15. If this deadline is exceeded (that is, from the sixth day, the price will rise and fall freely, etc.), it will be up to each party to decide on its own. According to general observation, after the difficult five days have passed, the yarn price can be stable in the future and no special changes will occur.

Resumption of Bidding and Market Price Fall, after the broker's conference adjourned, the resumption of bidding began at 11:00. The first plate (June) was 288 yuan (7 yuan lower than the red card), (July) 282 yuan (5 yuan 5 jiao lower), (August) 279.6 jiao (4 yuan 9 jiao lower), (September) 280 yuan (5 yuan lower). The second plate (June) was 289 yuan, (July) 282.6 jiao, (August) 280.1 jiao, (September) 280 yuan. The third plate (June) was 289 yuan, (July) 282.8 jiao, (August) 280 yuan, (September) same. Closing price (June) was 298 yuan, (last month) 282.5 jiao, (August) 280.1 jiao (September) 279.6 jiao. The fourth plate was not completely sold out until 1:00 pm. After the market was resold from 2:00 pm, the first plate (June) was 289.8 jiao, (July) 283 yuan, (August) 280.01 points, (September) 280 yuan (the second, third and fourth plates were the same price). The second plate (June) was 290 yuan (the third and fourth plates were the same price), (July) 283.5 jiao (the third and fourth plates were the same price), (August) 280.05 points (the third and fourth plates were the same price). The total number of long and short-term transactions of the upper and lower plates was about 138,000 pieces. Because the market price gradually fell, the market sentiment became stable, and the panic was completely eliminated.

The Exchange Handles the Pursuit of Evidence Procedures

Since the market price fell after the resumption of trading in the morning, most of the shorts have handled the settlement procedures by themselves to avoid further losses. However, a small number of shorts with slightly better financial resources hope that the market price will fall again to make up for the huge losses. However, in order to comply with the market business regulations, the Exchange immediately notified all brokers to handle the pursuit of evidence procedures after the resumption yesterday morning, and the situation was quite good.

Cheng, the Actual Official, Stopped Coming to Shanghai Yesterday

The Ministry of Industry believes that the yarn and cloth exchange in Shanghai is full of speculators, and the market has repeatedly experienced turmoil for many years. This time, the market chaos has created a serious situation that has a great impact on the social economy. It is believed that it is necessary to deal with it severely. It ordered Cheng Tiangu, the Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry, to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the truth. After Cheng was ordered, he originally planned to take the night train to Shanghai the night before, but failed due to temporary matters. Now it is learned that Cheng is determined to come to Shanghai from Beijing today (12th) because the yarn tide needs to be thoroughly investigated. After Cheng arrives in Shanghai, he will summon Wang Xiaolai, the supervisor of the exchange, and Mu Ouchu, the chairman of the yarn and cloth exchange, to inquire about the cause of the turmoil and the market situation so that he can supervise and cooperate with the supervisor in accordance with the Exchange Law to impose effective sanctions so that the turmoil will not happen again. The rumor that he had come to Shanghai yesterday is not true.

Wang Xiaolai Asked the Ministry of Industry for Instructions

Wang Xiaolai, the supervisor of the exchange, believed that the serious turmoil in the yarn and cloth trading market this time, the stalemate between the long and short sides, led to confusion and the social economy was also deeply affected, so on the 10th, he telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to report the situation he had investigated and asked for instructions on how to handle it, and asked to determine the handling method before implementing it.

Investigation of the Number of Transactions of Shorts, after the longs controlled the market on June 8, the market price soared, causing panic. The brokers of the exchange were unable to collect, so the market was chaotic and unable to trade. The total number of transactions at the close of the exchange on the 8th was 95,400 pieces. Among them, the shorts who sold the most yarn and suffered the most losses were: broker (No. 3) 2,350 pieces, (No. 5) 5,950 pieces, (No. 6) 2,400 pieces, (No. 7) 2,650 pieces, (No. 17) 3,000 pieces, (No. 20) 2,750 pieces, (No. 22) 2,900 pieces, (No. 25) 2,500 pieces, (No. 31) 6,650 pieces, (No. 32) 2,900 pieces, (No. 34) 3,300 pieces, (No. 39) 4,600 pieces, (No. 40) 3,300 pieces, (No. 46) 4,900 pieces, (No. 53) 5,050 pieces (No. 55) 7,600 pieces, (No. 66) 10,002 pieces, and other sporadic customers, totaling more than 10 million yuan in losses. After the resumption of trading yesterday, the market fell by 4.5 yuan, which can recover 3-4 million yuan in losses and raise funds.

### The Whereabouts of Current People

Sun Ke, Chu Minyi, and Wei Daoming took the night express train out of Beijing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning. Zhang Gongquan took the 5:30 pm express train from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday and arrived at the station at 10:20 pm.

Zhang Qun took the 8:00 am express train to Beijing yesterday.

Jiang Bocheng took the night express train to Beijing yesterday.

### Huang Ji Visited Song Ziwen Yesterday Morning

Discussing the Reorganization of the Financial Problems in Guilin Province

Regarding the development of the economy, railway construction, and reorganization of financial problems in Guilin Province, Gan Jiehou, the representative of Li Zongren, the Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army, and Bai Chongxi, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and Huang Ji, the representative of the Guangxi Provincial Government and the Director of the Guangxi Provincial Bank, have been negotiating with the authorities and the progress is very smooth. It is learned that in addition to Gan, who visited Song Ziwen the day before yesterday and will soon take a boat back to the south to report his mission, Huang also visited Song at the China Construction Bank at 9:30 yesterday morning to discuss in detail the financial problems of Guilin Province, the reorganization of the monetary system, and the establishment of a Guilin branch of the Central Bank for an hour before leaving. Huang was assigned to stay in Beijing and Shanghai to continue negotiations.

### The Family Exhibition Hosted the Press Yesterday

The China Industrial Improvement Family Exhibition was held at the Racecourse. Since its opening at the end of last month, the number of visitors has not declined slightly for two weeks, especially when the car performance was crowded. The Association specially hosted the local press in the field at 7:00 pm last night. During the dinner, Qian Chengxu gave a speech saying, "Distinguished guests, today is the Association's public banquet for journalists from the local press, and we are very happy to gather together. Since the Association opened two weeks ago, from the perspective of the exhibition itself, 62 Chinese merchants and 66 foreign merchants have participated, and the number of Chinese and foreign merchants is almost equal. As for the number of tourists in the field for two weeks, in addition to the 25,000 free admission tickets and 5,000 passes given by the Association, according to preliminary statistics, it has reached more than 100,000. The national emblem of our Republic of China is flying in the main position of the Racecourse building, and at the same time, the reputation of our national goods can be increased to the outside world, which should give colleagues more comfort and gratitude. However, the process of Sino-foreign cooperation in this session is something to be said at the dinner tonight. In May last year, Mr. Meilingden discussed the proposal of Sino-foreign manufacturers jointly forming the Shanghai International Commodity Exhibition. My opinion at the time was that if the Sino-foreign equal organization established the Chinese and Foreign Committee to preside over the central hub, it would be beneficial to the country's external promotion. However, in terms of initiation, the Chinese industrial and commercial leaders at the time, in view of the failure of another international exhibition in Yangshupu, were unwilling to participate and failed to achieve results. This year, Meilingden brought up the old matter again and showed the roster of foreign merchants joining the exhibition. I still insisted as before that the Chinese side would not bear the economic responsibility, but the two sides understood at the time that (1) the National Federation of Commerce and the China General Chamber of Industry would be invited to be sponsors, (2) the Chinese side would not receive any economic benefits from the foreign side, but the Association would give the Chinese side 10,000 free admission tickets and 1,000 passes, (3) If the Chinese exhibitors are members of the China General Chamber of Industry, they will pay the venue fee at a 50% discount, and will be given benefits to manufacturers and workers in the future, (4) The opening ceremony must be based on the Chinese side, and the national flag of the venue must be the national flag of the Republic of China. Everything has been implemented, which is gratifying. In short, the achievements of this exhibition, the policies and spirit held by the Chinese and foreign sides, can be promoted in the same direction and on the basis of cooperation, and the foundation for Sino-foreign cooperation has been laid for further work in the future." At about 9:00 pm, the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.

### The First Preparatory Meeting of the Industrial and Commercial Coordination Association

Elected the Director and Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee

The Industrial and Commercial Coordination Association held its first preparatory meeting at the Shanghai Accountants Association at 2:00 pm yesterday. All members of the preparatory committee attended, and He Yuanming was elected as the temporary chairman. First, the motion of the last sponsors' meeting was read out, and then the following was discussed: (1) How should the duties of the preparatory committee be distributed? It was decided to elect Jiang Huaisu as the director of the preparatory committee, He Yangwu, Zhang Dafu, and Jin Chuxiang as the organization, Zhao Erchang, Wang Jingdong, and Xu Chuansheng as the investigation, Sun Mingqi, Xie Zhongfu, and Wang Yuanzhang as the propaganda, Song Zhongqing, Chen Panjun, and Qu Zhenhua as the design, and Cao Qiming, Shen Weiting, Zhang Shishi, and Gu Wensheng as the finance. (2) How should the location of the preparatory committee be determined? It was decided to temporarily set the office of the preparatory committee at No. 424 Pudong Building, Edward Road. (3) How should the charter of the association be drafted? It was decided to hand it over to the organization department to draft together with the director and deputy directors. (4) How should the declaration of the association be drafted? It was decided to hand it over to the propaganda department to draft together with the director and deputy directors. (5) How should the funds of the preparatory committee be raised? It was decided that each preparatory member should raise 50 yuan of national currency, which should be paid by next Wednesday. (6) Determine the date of the next meeting. It was decided to hold it at 5:00 pm on June 16. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 pm.

### The National Goods Production and Sales Association Held a Regular Meeting of Members Yesterday

He Bocheng Spoke on Production Undertakings

The Shanghai China National Goods Production and Sales Association held its 207th regular meeting of members at Zhengyi Society on the 7th floor of the Continental Department Store at 12:00 pm yesterday. Chairman Wang Xingyao reported on the recent association affairs, and then the members exchanged opinions on improving business, and invited He Bocheng, the president of Jinan University, to speak on "Production Undertakings." He said that in recent years, our country has been severely oppressed by strong neighbors, and the people have a deep understanding of saving the country and surviving, and are working hard on production undertakings under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which is gratifying. Now the products of national goods factories are being improved day by day, and they can compete with foreign goods and recover many vested rights. It is hoped that national goods manufacturers will have more creative ability, increase production, and not imitate shadow plays to degrade their reputation, then the future of national goods will be unlimited. Then the meeting was followed by a dinner, and the meeting adjourned at about 3:00 pm.

### Sino-Dutch Trade: Chinese Deficit, Overseas Chinese Merchants Eager for Adjustment

Trade Deficit with China Exceeds 20 Million Guilders; Chinese Goods Exported to the Netherlands Subject to Restrictions

Sino-Dutch trade has seen considerable development in recent years. However, China consistently experiences a trade deficit with the Dutch East Indies. This is due to the restrictive import policies of the Dutch East Indies authorities. As a result, Chinese merchants abroad are eager for early negotiations on a Sino-Dutch commercial treaty. According to inquiries with relevant parties, in 1933, the Dutch East Indies' exports to China reached 10,093,000 Dutch guilders, while Chinese goods imported into the Dutch East Indies amounted to only 1,635,000 Dutch guilders. In terms of trade between the two countries last year, Dutch goods exported to China reached 23,319,000 Dutch guilders, while Chinese goods exported to the Netherlands were only 1,622,000 Dutch guilders. Comparing the two, China's trade deficit with the Netherlands was 21,156,800 Dutch guilders. From this perspective, China's financial outflow to the Netherlands reached over 20 million yuan, which is considerable. Fortunately, remittances from overseas Chinese compensate for this, mitigating the imbalance in trade between China and the Dutch East Indies. Overseas Chinese merchants are eager for this to be adjusted.

### Qujiang Wharf Officially Opens Today

China Merchants Kungping Steamer Makes Maiden Voyage to Shanghai; Inauguration Ceremony to be Held After Mr. Kung Returns to China

The Qujiang Wharf, built with investment from the Central Bank, has completed its first phase of construction. The equipment inside and outside the wharf is ready, and it will officially open today. A reporter learned last night that the first ship to dock at the wharf for its maiden voyage is the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Kungping, which sails the Shanghai-Guangdong-Hong Kong-Shantou route. The ship is scheduled to arrive at 6:00 AM this morning and dock at the wharf as a commemoration. The second ship to dock will be the Changxing Company's Empress of Japan, scheduled to arrive tomorrow (the 13th). The third ship to dock is the French mail ship, the Contre Rosso, which arrives in Shanghai on the 21st. It is understood that the wharf's opening today is welcomed by all sectors, and they are invited to visit. Once Director Kung returns to China, a grand inauguration ceremony will be held at a later date, and invitations will be formally extended to all sectors to participate.

### French Aviators Return to Shanghai from Japan After Their Lofty Ambition was Unfulfilled

French Consul General and Others Host Banquet Last Night; Set to Depart Shanghai on Original Ship this Morning to Return to France

The French aviators, Durant and Micheletti, who embarked on a long-distance record flight from Paris to Tokyo last month, encountered danger and were injured in Kochi Prefecture, Japan. After recuperating and fully recovering in Japan, they departed Kobe on the French mail ship, Félix Roussel, to return to France. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday and docked between buoys 10 and 23 of the Huangpu River. The French Consul General's aviation counselor and many others welcomed Durant and Micheletti. Upon arriving in Shanghai yesterday, both were dressed in light green suits, which they had newly made in Tokyo. They were both in high spirits. Except for a slight scar below his neck, Durant's face was completely healed. Micheletti's right hand was swollen, and the injury had not fully recovered, so his right hand was still suspended from his neck with a white bandage. However, according to Micheletti, although his right hand had not fully recovered, he was not in any pain and would be completely healed before arriving in France. Furthermore, according to Durant's conversation with a Shen Zhou News Agency reporter on the ship, their record flight attempt encountered an accident in Kochi Prefecture, Japan, due to extremely bad weather conditions at the time. It was fortunate that they were able to preserve their lives. They were grateful for the sympathy from people around the world for this unfortunate encounter, but they also deeply ashamed themselves. As for whether they would make a third attempt in the future, it would depend on the situation after returning to France. After arriving in Shanghai, Durant and others took a ferry to the Xinguans Wharf around 2:00 PM and then went to the French Consulate to meet Consul General Bodens. At 6:00 PM, the French community hosted Durant and Micheletti at the French Club. At 8:00 PM, the French Consul General hosted a banquet and then held a dance party starting at 10:00 PM. Durant is scheduled to take the original ship to France this morning.

### National Goods Joint Venture Company Holds Regular Board Meeting Today

Director Zhou Yichun Comes to Shanghai to Participate; Discussing Company Affairs and Joint Venture Situation

The China National Goods Joint Venture Company officially started operations on the 15th of last month. Currently, in addition to actively carrying out the announced business operations, it is learned that the company has not yet closed the past National Goods Joint Office. It is now planning to transfer the twelve national goods companies previously established in various locations and handled by the Women's Joint Office to the current company, depending on the needs of each location, increasing investment by one-third or one-half. This is expected to be completed in approximately two months. The company's first-phase business plan for the future is to establish seventeen national goods company branches in major commercial ports and towns. In addition to Nanjing, which was established on the 10th, Hangzhou and Chengdu are currently in negotiations. Furthermore, the company is scheduled to hold a board meeting at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss company affairs, report fees, and the joint venture situation. At that time, Minister Wu from the Ministry of Industry will send Vice Minister Zhou Yichun to participate as a representative. In addition, the company has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry's Social Affairs Bureau for registration. Once approved, 1 million yuan in shares will be issued immediately.

### Appeal Against Discrimination by the Municipal Council Against the Flower and Tree Industry

Paying Taxes the Same as Japanese Merchants; Why Suffer Oppression and Harsh Treatment in Return?

The Flower and Tree Industry Association of this city, along with the Vegetable Farmers Association, previously petitioned the Taxpaying Chinese Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to argue with the Municipal Council for fair treatment in order to maintain their livelihoods, due to the Municipal Council's discriminatory additional levies and harsh restrictions on Chinese flower merchants. According to the person in charge of the association, the Taxpayers Association has not yet negotiated with the Municipal Council, but the oppression from the Council is increasing daily. Recently, several flower merchants have been prosecuted and fined by the Council's Health Department in the Special District Court for violating regulations due to time constraints. On the other hand, Japanese flower stalls in the same vegetable market are allowed to operate freely without any time restrictions. The treatment of merchants paying the same taxes is like heaven and earth. Chinese merchants pay two yuan more in taxes each month than Japanese merchants, yet the treatment they receive is the opposite: one is restricted, and the other is free. There is no such reason in the world, so it is hoped that people in society will pay attention to this and advocate for fair treatment. It is heard that the Municipal Council will soon extend this practice from the Hongkou area to all vegetable markets, which will inevitably endanger all flower merchants.

### Representatives of Silk Weaving Factory Workers Throughout the City Petitioned the City Party Headquarters Yesterday

Detained Workers Have Been Handed Over to the Headquarters for Legal Processing; Social Affairs Bureau Orders the Meiya Factory to Resume Work Immediately

The silk weaving industry strike in this city has been deadlocked for a long time without a resolution. The Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation between the two parties the day before yesterday, but it did not resolve the issue because the representative of the capital side refused to attend. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, more than 300 representatives of silk weaving factory workers throughout the city gathered in a team to petition the City Party Headquarters, demanding the release of Wang Hao, the secretary of the Third District Silk Weaving Union who was arrested, and ordering the factory to resume work. They dispersed around 4:00 PM. The details are recorded below:

Citywide Silk Weaving Workers Petition

The city's party and government agencies, in order to quickly resolve the long-standing silk weaving strike, arrested the leading radical elements, Zhu Baiqing, Ye Jinsheng, Qian Gaoqing, etc. and the day before yesterday (the 10th) summoned the factory side to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, but it did not resolve the issue because the capital side did not send a representative to attend. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, more than 300 worker representatives from the Meiya General Factory and various branches, Xinhua, Fuxing, Yaohua, Meiwen, Dafeng, Yusheng, Huiging, Jinsheng, Xiangji, Yuantong, Qichang, Jiulong, Yongji, Yinli, Yingfeng, Jufeng, Tiancheng, Wanbao, Weichang, Zhicheng, Xiezhe, Xiangbao Hoxing, Baohua, Fengda, Yunlin, Yixin, Shixin, Yifeng, Rongcheng, Xielong, Yingyu, Weiji, Jingyu, Jinsheng, Yiyou, Yuyuan, Puyi, Tongyi, Xinkong, Xiesheng, Xieda, Guanghua, Quangong, and dozens of other factories gathered at the Meiya General Factory in Rihui Port and petitioned the City Party Headquarters in Fenglin Bridge. Because of the large number of people, the City Party Headquarters ordered them to send responsible representatives to enter for talks. The workers from various factories elected Shen Jiancan, Ni Xueyi, Zhang Yuezhen, Ye Chunqi, Dong Wei, Wang Chunhui, etc. as representatives. The Director of the Workers and Peasants Division of the Civil Movement Section, Zhang Sheng, and staff member Dai Yongchan received them. The workers made two demands: (1) Release Wang Hao, the secretary of the Third District Silk Weaving Union who was detained, and (2) Order the factory to resume work immediately. The representatives of the Party Headquarters repeatedly explained, but the workers expressed dissatisfaction until around 4:00 PM, when the Party Headquarters had already stopped working. After the final persuasion, they dispersed.

Detained Workers Handed Over to Headquarters

In order to quickly resolve the silk weaving strike, the party and government agencies arrested the radical elements Zhu Baiqing, Ye Jinsheng, Shi Miaotang, Ma Zhenyao, Yuan Laoyi, Qian Gaoqing, Zhi Zhangqiao, Zhang Changjin, Shang Shuitang, Wang Boquan, etc. by the police station's investigation team and, after an interrogation by the Third Section yesterday morning, transferred them to the Garrison Headquarters for legal punishment. As for Ma Jiongwen, who was arrested by the Public Concession Police, he is still being held at the First Special District Court and has not yet been extradited. The news reported a few days ago that Wang Hao had been arrested has not been confirmed as of yesterday. (According to a letter from the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association, the previous reports in various newspapers that the main culprit of the silk weaving strike, Wang Hao, etc., was captured at No. 41 Changchun Inn, Zhejiang Road, on the 9th is not true. It has been found that the person arrested was Zhu Xuequan, a worker at the Puyi Silk Factory in the West Shanghai District. However, Zhu Xuequan is also a secondary member of this silk weaving strike. As for the main members, Wang Hao, etc., they are still at large, but the authorities are working to arrest them.)

Social Affairs Bureau Limits to Resume Work Tomorrow

The City Social Affairs Bureau's handling of the silk weaving industry strike has been strictly implemented in accordance with the adjudication method, and in order to clarify the opinions of both parties, it summoned them for questioning again the day before yesterday, but there was no result because the capital side was absent. It is learned that the Social Affairs Bureau issued an instruction to the Silk Weaving Industry Association yesterday, ordering all factories to resume work by the 13th of this month and notifying all factories to resume work. If there are any violations, strict measures will be taken.

### Exhibition of Achievements in Maternal and Child Protection in the Soviet Union Opened Yesterday

Will be Transported to Other Cities for Exhibition

The Exhibition of Achievements in Maternal and Child Protection in the Soviet Union, organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, opened on the ninth floor of the Shanghai YMCA from the 9th. Since opening, a large number of visitors have visited, reaching several thousand people. Due to the limitations of the venue, it cannot continue to be exhibited. It closed yesterday afternoon. It is heard that the charts and tables will be transported to other cities for exhibition, so that Chinese people can learn from them.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Petitioned to Prohibit the Slaughter of Ewes Carrying Fetuses

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce presented to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: Regarding the matter of submitting a petition, on the 10th of this month, a letter was received from the Buffalo and Sheep Industry Association of this city, stating that the affiliated association has recently been jointly informed by members Senchun Tong, Senchun Rui, You Zengfa, Zhang Longji, Hongxing Sheep Shop, Pan Jiaji Meat Shop, Fei Shunji, etc., stating that members have been selling mutton, and since the beginning of this year, they have been frequently affected by the sharp increase in sheep prices, and business is extremely difficult. It is difficult to cope with the increasing losses. The goods sold daily are limited by the fixed-order contract and cannot be increased with the current price. The reason for the soaring price is that the herders in the sheep-producing areas greed for high profits and, in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, slaughter and skin the lamb just out of the mother's womb for sale to obtain huge prices. In winter, they slaughter pregnant ewes, skin them for sale to obtain even greater prices. The price of a fetus lamb is several times higher than the price of a whole lamb. Herders greedy for high profits, regardless of cruelty, specialize in slaughtering fetus lambs for sale. There are very few lambs sold in the market. Even if there are occasional ones, the price must be increased to more than three times. Therefore, the number of lambs coming to Shanghai is becoming increasingly scarce, and now they are almost out of stock. Since the supply is so scarce, the price of goods is increasing day by day, without limit. Members are about to be in a situation where they cannot operate. The huge losses have reached the extreme. If a fundamental method of relief is not planned, the business of the members will inevitably be unable to maintain. This phenomenon not only hinders the operation of the industry but also reduces the government's inspection fees for food lambs. Slaughtering fetus lambs does not need to be limited to the slaughterhouse and does not need to request government inspection. They can do whatever they want and slaughter privately anywhere to avoid government inspection. Moreover, slaughtering lambs is cruel and not only hinders the production of sheep but also violates the way of loving animals. The small sheepskin is sold to unscrupulous merchants for private transportation out of the country. Loading is convenient, and it is easy for customs to steal and leak taxes. Slaughtering fetus lambs has a very serious impact. For public and private reasons, it is necessary to prohibit it immediately. A table of sheep-producing areas is attached. The association is requested to forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and then to the competent ministry, ordering a strict ban on herders in sheep-producing areas from slaughtering the two types of lambs in order to maintain the production of sheep and avoid meat food panic. The association has received public interests. According to the investigation, the slaughter of fetus lambs by herders in various sheep-producing areas has caused a sheep panic, soaring prices, and the city has been greatly affected. Sheep industry members are almost forced to suspend business. According to the previous situation, a letter and a table of sheep-producing areas are attached to the association, requesting that they be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, ordering them to investigate and prohibit them in order to maintain the sheep industry. The association received the public interest. According to the investigation, farmers in Zhejiang Province are competing to slaughter lambs to sell the skin, hoping to obtain high profits. Not only has the price of lambs in Shanghai soared, and the industry is in trouble, but the breeding of sheep in Zhejiang Province is gradually decreasing, and livestock is being depleted daily. This kind of temporary profit-seeking behavior is a suicidal policy and has a huge impact on the secondary industry of farmers in Zhejiang Province. However, farmers have short-sighted and shallow thoughts, and I am afraid that a paper document cannot be effective. According to the previous letter, it is appropriate to prepare a document to request the ministry to examine and approve it and to consult the Zhejiang Provincial authorities to properly investigate and prevent the measures, so as to achieve practical results and benefit farmers and merchants.

### Authorities Pay Attention to Abnormalities in the Flour Market

Recently, due to the impact of fluctuations in the yarn market, the flour market soared to one corner the day before yesterday and announced a halt to auctions. Although it has been suppressed by all parties and gradually stabilized, according to observations familiar with the market situation, according to the past situation, at the time of the new wheat market, factories should be increasing production and shipping, so it should be low. Therefore, this abnormal situation may be manipulated by some bull companies, which does not seem to be a normal supply and demand relationship. Therefore, the government authorities are paying close attention to this abnormal situation.

### Members of the Friendship Troupe Returning to Shanghai from the North

The eighth North China tour organized by the Friendship Travel Troupe in this city, with more than 100 participating members, has been completed. They boarded a special train at 7:40 PM last night, led by the troupe leaders Liu Yuqi, Zhu Jinru, Chen Minghui, and Guan Yiming. At one time, all the troupe's cadres and family members of the members arrived at the station to welcome them. The sound of firecrackers and hanging lanterns were extremely magnificent. It is heard that the participating members were unusually energetic.

### A Glimpse of Recent Salt Affairs Adjustment in Production and Sales

Field Production Managed by the Government, Transportation and Sales Promote the Free System; Salt Tax Not Pre-collected, Salt Administration Progresses Without Crisis

Recent reforms in salt affairs have already attracted the attention of all sectors. According to a senior official of the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance, the recent situations of adjustment in production and sales are as follows: Regarding the field production section, since the salt affairs agency adjusted and unified administrative tax collection and anti-smuggling powers, field production management has become increasingly strict. Commissioners are responsible for supervising salt boiling and sun drying. There is a fixed time for returning to the warehouse and stacking, so that the predetermined production quota can be followed before production, in order to avoid the risk of overproduction and stagnation, or underproduction and famine, and to prevent scattered field beaches after production without restriction, so as to eliminate the source of private sales. In addition to this, the related field production projects, such as the construction of warehouses, opening salt field roads, digging group beach ditches, and laying telephones, tax police barracks, etc., are being actively carried out in various regions. This project is extremely important and can be completed within five years. From then on, salt field management can be perfected. The improvement of transportation and sales such as water transportation, promotion of wheel transportation, and land use of cars and trains are all improvements that can be made with the improvement of social transportation tools. However, the promotion of free trade depends on careful planning and human promotion. Since the introduction and coast system of salt sales in our country has a long history, at the beginning of the reform, we can only adopt a gradual policy in order to reduce resistance. It is estimated that since this policy was promoted since the 21st year of the Republic of China, more than 1,000 counties and cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Fujian, Sichuan, Guangdong, Gansu, and Beijing have successively implemented it. In addition, last year, in order to adjust people's food and store salt for use, Changping salt storage was organized in various places in accordance with the order. However, there have been some misunderstandings about this move, such as the recent article by Shi Qianjun in a newspaper "The Crisis of China's Salt Tax", which refers to this as the salt affairs authorities engaging in pre-collection of salt tax. In fact, the Changping salt was originally based on official transportation as a principle. However, due to the difficulty of national strength, we had to rely on commercial power at the same time. Therefore, the official transportation batch is owned by the government when it arrives at the shore. There is no need to collect taxes, and there is no pre-collection. The commercial transportation batch, except for the four shores, has not collected taxes in other places. That is, those transported and stored on the four shores only collect a field tax of three yuan per load and a shore tax of seven yuan and four corners per load, and no fundamental tax is collected. And in order to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants, the bill is collected, and according to the salt affairs accounting practice, the bill must be due before it can be included in the salt account. That is, only the field tax is collected, and the salt from the field that has not paid the shore tax is not included in the number of salt released. Moreover, merchants who transport Changping salt commercially will reduce the transportation of ordinary ticket salt because the capital cannot be accumulated for too long. That is, a part of Changping salt has been used as ticket salt for transportation and sales. Therefore, the article estimates that last year's tax revenue of 250 million yuan, excluding the estimated pre-tax of 58 million yuan, is speculative and deviates from the facts. Moreover, the amount of salt released in the sales area in the 25th year was 44,427,000 loads, and the 24th year was 38,990,000 loads, an actual increase of more than 6.4 million market loads, which is the actual sales volume and has nothing to do with Changping salt. As for the pre-collected tax, in the past few years, various regions often borrowed money to solve the problem, and the amount was quite large. After years of active reorganization, all previous loans have been repaid. If this is referred to as a crisis of salt tax, it has already become the past. In recent years, the amount of salt released, such as 36 million loads in the 18th year, 40 million loads in the 19th year, 43 million loads in the 20th year, 41 million loads in the 21st year, 42 million loads in the 22nd year, and 37 million loads in the 23rd year (the numbers for the 24th and 25th years are mentioned above). Except for the reduction in the 21st year, which was due to foreign troubles and internal disasters, the implementation of market weighing in the 23rd year, the universal tax increase in various regions, sincerely reduced the sales volume sharply. However, after adjusting personnel, tightening anti-smuggling, and actively reorganizing, the number has gradually returned to its old appearance and gradually progressed. Therefore, the article's statement that my country's salt tax has reached the point of collapse clearly shows that it has not seen the essence of the facts. This matter is related to the adjustment of production and sales, and the misunderstanding has caused serious misrepresentation of salt affairs facilities. I will add an explanation here.

### The Municipal Joint Council Inquires About Household Water Bills

Dues Paid Afterwards Should Be Deducted

The First Special District Citizens' United Council of this city, in order to ensure that the Municipal Council of the Public Concession collects police donations, has stipulated that for households whose tap water is supplied by the landlord, the tap water fee should be removed when calculating the donation (10% for foreigners, 5% for Chinese). However, most of the tap water in the district is supplied by the landlord, and citizens who do not know the rules often calculate the tap water fee together with the rent when paying the donation. They are deceived and suffer huge losses. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Real Estate Industry Association to inquire about the tap water fees in the district, and at the same time, the sub-councils in various districts were notified to inform the residents to deduct the water fee in the future and pay the donation according to the actual price of the rent to avoid extra losses. At the same time, since the deduction of tap water fees has not given equal treatment to Chinese and foreigners, the council also intends to argue with the Municipal Council for fair treatment in order to protect the interests of the citizens.

### Horse-riding Thief Arrested

A horse-riding thief who pretended to be an old Siwu from various companies, taking goods as a pretext, and taking the opportunity to steal goods from various cargo stations has been lying low for a long time since the police station ordered strict arrests. However, the day before yesterday evening, a Yangzhou man, Zhu Lanxi, falsely pretending to be an old Siwu from Fuxing Miscellaneous Grain Bank, carrying five sample bags and one sack, stole wheat from the Taikoo Warehouse in Laiyidu, Pudong, and carried it to the shore to escape on a boat hired by Xie Yougao. He was caught by the police in the warehouse and sent to the Pudong Branch and transferred to the local court for interrogation.

### The Central Savings Society Will Draw Lots

The Central Savings Society's 15th lottery will be held publicly at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in this city on the 15th of this month. The special prize is 25,000 yuan. The number of lottery tickets sold will soon exceed 50,000. The special prize will also exceed 25,000 yuan in the future and gradually increase to 50,000 yuan. It is heard that the number of first, second, third, and fourth prizes has been increased to 24 each. There are many additional prizes and last prizes, and it is very easy to win the lottery. In order to facilitate old depositors to pay and new depositors to join, the association will be open as usual on Saturday afternoon and all day on Sunday.

### The Anti-Trafficking Movement Committee Elects and Requests Severe Punishment of Unscrupulous Merchants

Eliminate the Roots of Smuggled Goods, Maintain the Lifeline of the Country

The Anti-Trafficking Movement Committee of all sectors in this city sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: (Titles omitted) The state establishes customs to collect taxes, not only for the sake of finance, but also to protect the domestic production industry to maintain the livelihood of the people. At this time of commercial warfare, all countries are implementing tariff policies to resist each other. However, the Japanese have not only occupied the Northeast provinces with bold moves, but also connived with ronin to steal taxes and smuggle in order to realize their conspiracy of economic aggression. First in North China, then in Central China and South China, the smuggling trend has spread throughout the country and deeply into the hinterland. The losses suffered by the state finance and the national economy are difficult to enumerate. If we do not urgently seek to stop it, the people's livelihood will be difficult and the foundation of the country will be shaken. Even if people do not destroy us by force, they will also fall into ruin by the exhaustion of economic resources. All sectors of this city are pained by the rampant smuggling and endangerment of the foundation of the country, and the Anti-Trafficking Movement Committee was established to awaken the people of the country, not to be greedy for cheapness, not to pursue immediate interests, and to unanimously reject smuggled goods. It is believed that the simultaneous implementation of anti-smuggling and anti-rejection will achieve complete success. Therefore, we specially send a telegram to the Ministry to request that all customs checkpoints across the country strictly investigate and suppress smuggled goods, without the slightest slack, and earnestly implement the anti-smuggling regulations to punish traitors and unscrupulous merchants, thereby eliminating the roots of smuggled goods and maintaining the lifeline of the country.

### Local Coal Production and Sales Association Exposes Inside Story of Private Coal Trafficking

Renamed Hebei Coal Zhongfu to Solely Sell; Letter Urges Boycott of Illicit Goods and Requests Sanctions

Meiye News Agency reports that Yu Shunqing, a standing committee member of the Local Coal Production and Sales Association, has accused unscrupulous merchants of relabeling stolen coal from the Liu Jiang mine and dumping it on the market, disrupting the national coal market. Yesterday, he specifically sent a letter to the Association for Boycotting Illicit Goods, requesting effective sanctions to maintain the transportation and sales of national coal. The letter stated: "To Whom It May Concern: The Liu Jiang Coal Mine has suffered misfortune, subjected to coercion by foreigners and deprived of its freedom, followed by violent occupation and exploitation. In a recent shareholders' meeting in Shanghai, the Liu Jiang Company shockingly resigned itself to its fate, willing to cede its agency for 600,000 yuan to the occupiers. Fortunately, the Shanghai media's righteous condemnation awakened the public to oppose this, and the Ministry of Industry issued a strict prohibition, thus preserving national sovereignty. However, it has been found that certain unscrupulous merchants are cooperating with the occupiers in financing their operations. In Shanghai, someone is the mastermind, using a certain company's name to enter into a sole sales agreement with a certain foreign firm, relabeling the coal as Hebei coal to deceive the public and manipulate the coal market. Last year, disputes arose among these unscrupulous merchants due to unequal distribution of profits, leading to several hearings in the First Special District Court, which are on record. These unscrupulous merchants are deceiving the government and cheating the people, outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, fostering the trade of illicit goods. If the nation ceases to be a nation, how can the people endure? Thinking of this, my heart aches. Therefore, I am not afraid of violence and report the facts truthfully, urging your association to impose effective sanctions to save the nation and the people. This is a crucial moment."

### Representatives from Disaster Areas in Shanxi Province, Luo Zengshou and Others, Arrive in Shanghai

Yesterday's Visit to Zhu Qinglan to Report on the Disaster; Request for Compassion for the Victims and to Raise Funds for Relief

The drought in Hedong, Shanxi Province, is severe, and relief is urgently needed. Representatives Luo Zengshou, Zhu Enrong, and others were specially dispatched to Beijing and then to Shanghai to appeal to various charitable organizations. They arrived in Shanghai on the 10th, requesting relief from the Joint Charity Relief Association, and yesterday morning, they visited Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Relief Committee, to report on the disaster situation.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Raises Bund Embankment

Preventing Heavy Rain, High Tides, and Strong Winds; Installing Pumping Stations for Rapid Drainage

The North-China Daily News reports that the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council has started reinforcing the Bund embankment with a large team of workers to prevent flooding. Engineers expect the project to be completed in one month, preparing for the coming typhoon season. A flood barrier about two feet high is planned to be built along the riverbank for protection, and a powerful pumping station will be constructed near the end of Fuzhou Road to help drain the sewers during flooding. The construction of the flood barrier has already begun near the Peace Monument. There are three major causes of flooding in the concession: 1. Heavy rain; 2. High tides; 3. Simultaneous high tides and strong winds. Although the water in the Huangpu River rarely rises above the riverbank, it often overflows during typhoons. Except for the section from Jiujiang Road to Beijing Road, which has been filled and is adequately protected, the entire Bund will now be protected by a flood barrier about two feet high, with some sections slightly higher. The pumping station will be located near the HSBC Bank, using electricity to pump approximately 3,000 gallons of water per minute. The area covered will be limited to the Bund, Avenue Edward VII, Fuzhou Road, and Henan Road, which are the most prone to flooding. In the future, adjacent areas may be included in the pumping zone. The current plan is to keep the sewers flowing smoothly and the roads dry during flooding. Another benefit of the pumping station is that low-lying areas within the concession, which are flooded during high tides, often retain water even after the tide recedes. In the future, the pumping station will allow for rapid drainage.

### Local Intermittent Rain

The Huangpu River Tide is Quite High; Sewers in Low-Lying Areas Overflow

Datong News Agency reports that Shanghai experienced intermittent rain again yesterday, continuing throughout the day. The atmospheric pressure was quite low and humid. As a result, the tide in the Huangpu River was quite high. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the high tide reached nearly eleven feet, causing sewers in particularly low-lying roads to overflow. At the same time, the water level in the Yangtze River, from Yichang in the middle reaches to the Yangtze River estuary outside Wusong, is rising daily, posing a significant threat to the embankments.

### Male Room Service Employee at Shanghai New Hotel Commits Suicide by Poisoning

Name Unknown; Body Examined Yesterday

At approximately 10:00 PM on the 7th of this month, a middle-aged man went to the Shanghai New Hotel at No. 14, Lane 506, Hubei Road, and booked room number 28. On the registration book, he wrote his name as Chen Baoshan, from Baoshan, 34 years old. However, the next day at noon, the hotel's tea boy, Xie Axiao, discovered that he was delirious and lying on the bed. He immediately informed the front desk, and an ambulance was called to the scene, rushing him to Renji Hospital. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he died at 2:00 PM that day. The hospital reported this to the Laozha Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. It was learned that the deceased had committed suicide by swallowing sleeping pills. Because there were no suicide notes or other items, the reason for the suicide and whether he had any family members are unknown. The body was transported to the forensic examination office on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the office and confirmed that the deceased, Chen Baosheng, male, had indeed died from poisoning. The body was handed over to Pushan Cemetery for burial.

### Shouxian Historical Site Excavation Team Prepares to Depart in Early Autumn

Led by Hu Zhaochun, Director of the Municipal Museum; First Phase of Work to Last Three Months, Using Scientific Excavation Methods

Shouxian in northern Anhui was once a flourishing center of culture and the new capital of the State of Chu. Since the discovery of a large number of antiquities at Li San Gu Dui in the county in 1933, academic institutions in the north and south, such as the Peiping Library, have organized teams to investigate and determined that there are many antiquities that would greatly benefit cultural history and geography. In 1935, Ye Gongchuo, a representative of the investigation team, initiated its development. It has now been decided that the Shanghai Municipal Museum and the Anhui Provincial Library will be responsible for carrying out the work and organizing the Shouxian Historical Site Excavation Team. According to a report from a Shenzhou News Agency reporter yesterday, the team has decided that Hu Zhaochun, Director of the Shanghai Museum, will lead the team, and approximately six people from the museum will participate. The museum has sent personnel to Shouxian twice to make arrangements, and all preparations have been completed. The original plan was to depart at the beginning of this month, but due to the museum's extremely busy schedule with the Document Exhibition and other matters, the departure has been postponed until early autumn this year. The first phase of excavation is scheduled for three months as a trial. The team will organize the historical sites in the county and use scientific methods for excavation, such as drawing, photographing, surveying, modeling, and recording, to ensure that the excavation process is documented in detail. Li San Gu Dui is located in Zhujiaji, Shouxian, and is also known as Li San Gu Dui. There are also seven or eight other Gu Dui sites in the area that are related to Li San Gu Dui. Ying Bu of the Han Dynasty, Liu An, Prince of Huainan, and Yuan Shu of the Three Kingdoms all established their capitals in Shouchun.

### Bank Guard in Mainland Bank Commits Suicide by Shooting After Requesting Leave

Li, a security guard employed by the Mainland Bank branch at No. 114 Fangbang Road in the city to guard the Yimiao Police Station, requested leave after his shift yesterday afternoon. After dismounting from his duty post, the guard did not return the publicly used pistol to the depot, falsely claiming that it was rusty and intending to take it to the bureau for repairs. The bank did not suspect anything amiss. Unexpectedly, in the evening, the Li guard, for reasons unknown, committed suicide with the gun. Discovered by his colleagues, he was immediately taken to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by hired car. It is reported that the injuries were quite serious. The bank has reported to the relevant police station for investigation.

### Wang Xinggao Released on Bail After Original Sentence Revoked for Further Review

Supreme Court Reviews Entire Case File; Testimony of Witnesses Contains Many Doubts

Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing, was previously reported by Zhao Guangfu, the murderer sentenced to life imprisonment in the Tang Jiapeng murder case, to the Law Enforcement Office as Wang Jinkui, the principal offender who instigated the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. The French Concession Police dispatched detectives on January 13, 1935, to arrest Wang along with Chinese and Western detectives from the Laozha Police Station at the Central Hotel. He was sent to the Second Special District Court and prosecuted for the crime of instigating murder. After the trial, Wang Xinggao was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for life. Wang refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The Third Branch of the High Court conducted a thorough investigation of various locations, including the Hubei High Court, for over a year. It was not until the summer of last year that the final trial was concluded, and the original verdict was revoked, changing the sentence to Wang Xinggao being found not guilty. Within the appeal period, it was ruled that he could be released on bail of 20,000 yuan with a guarantee that he would appear when summoned, and his detention was suspended. As a result, his family requested assistance from six formal shops to provide a written guarantee for Wang's release. Later, because the Law Enforcement Office refused to accept the second instance verdict, it petitioned the Third Branch of the High Court, and the prosecutor filed a third instance appeal with the Supreme Court. These circumstances have been recorded in this newspaper. Since the filing of the second instance appeal, many years have passed. It is now known that the Supreme Court, after reviewing the entire case file, found that the previous and subsequent testimonies of the witness, Zhao Guangfu, the accuser, contained many doubts and considered that the original verdict was not thorough enough. Therefore, the Supreme Court revoked the original verdict and sent the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for further review. The judgment and case file have been sent to the Third Branch of the High Court. It is heard that the First Branch of the High Court received the case file a few days ago and dispatched bailiffs to deliver the judgment yesterday. Investigations and trials will be conducted in the near future.

### Shanghai Document Exhibition Conference Invites Collection Directors from Various Counties

Establishes Methods for Consigning Books and Items for Sale

With only ten days left until the deadline for submitting items to the Shanghai Document Exhibition, various counties have been sending in their registration forms to the conference. The work at the office is extremely busy. The receiving point at the Municipal Gazetteer Hall also receives many items daily. In addition to Jiading, Jinshan and other counties, which have already sent hundreds of items in the first batch by the collection directors, other counties have also been shipping items to Shanghai one after another. Because many of the items in this exhibition are precious, the conference is paying close attention to storage. In the future, the exhibits will be displayed in thick glass cabinets, and even paintings and calligraphy will be hung inside to ensure that they are not damaged, no matter how crowded the visitors are. Zhu Kaijian, the collection director of Taicang, visited the exhibition site yesterday with the exhibitors and was very satisfied. He believed that the arrangements were unprecedented compared to previous exhibitions. Because there are several important matters that urgently need to be discussed with the collection directors from various counties, and the counties also have many opinions to exchange with each other, it has been decided to hold a meeting at noon on the 16th of this month at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge. The notification letter has been sent out today. The conference has also received dozens of requests daily from various publishing industries and exhibitors who want to sell books and items at the exhibition site. Therefore, the conference has specially established methods for consigning books and items for sale to ensure uniformity. The methods are listed as follows: 1. To facilitate exhibitors in selling books and items at the exhibition site, the conference has established a sales point, which will be managed by personnel from the conference office. 2. Those who consign books and items for sale must contact the office before June 25, fill out a consignment form. The office reserves the right to refuse consignment if it deems it inconvenient to sell. 3. Consigned books and items must be sent to the conference before June 30. The quantity of each type will be determined by the office. If there are any shortages, they should be replenished at any time. One week after the end of the exhibition, the consignors should come to the conference to retrieve the remaining stock. 4. The conference will retain 15% of the actual price as a handling fee for consigned books and items. The remaining proceeds, along with the remaining stock, will be settled with the consignors one week after the end of the exhibition. 5. Exhibitors who wish to sell exhibited items must indicate this in the product registration form. The conference may indicate the price on the label and handle the sale in accordance with Articles 2, 3, and 4 of these methods. 6. Regardless of whether items are consigned or sold, the consignors may not use other promotional methods in the exhibition site, except for the sales advertisements posted by the conference.

### Issue of Small Cars Entering the International Settlement

The Mainland News reports that after the news that the French Municipal Council has allowed the establishment of small car companies, various taxi companies in the International Settlement have been doing their utmost to abolish this measure. These people believe that it is difficult to make a profit if these small cars only operate in the French Concession. The trial operation in the French Concession aims to break the policy of the Municipal Council, which has always opposed street-hailing cars and "baby cars." On June 6, a Western merchant car company sent a letter in its name to the Transportation Department of the Municipal Council, explaining the situation. On Wednesday, the Local Taxi Owners Association also submitted a letter to the Municipal Council, protesting and at the same time submitting a letter to the Municipal Council and the Transportation Department of the Municipal Council, stating that the harm of these small cars outweighs the benefits. It is not known what the authorities in the two concessions will do. Yesterday (the 10th), a spokesman for the Municipal Council told a reporter from the Mainland News that according to the current traffic regulations, small cars cannot pass through the International Settlement. The initiators may think that if they have obtained a car permit from the Municipal Council, they can drive into the International Settlement, but this is not the case. Private car owners residing in the French Concession can drive their cars into the International Settlement if they have obtained a car permit from the Municipal Council, but for rental cars and cargo cars, the owners must obtain permits from both sides before they can operate in the two concessions. Therefore, according to the currently implemented traffic regulations, these small cars can definitely not drive into the International Settlement.

After the French Municipal Council approved the operation of small cars within the concession, it caused repercussions from all sides. The Taxi Association had previously contacted the Municipal Council for negotiation. It is heard that the American company Yunfei Automobile Company also sent a letter to the International Settlement yesterday, expressing its opposition and stating the harm of operating small cars.

### Health Bureau Advises Those Who Like to Eat Puffer Fish

Please Burn Toxic Parts to Avoid Poisoning and Death for Those Who Pick Them Up

According to the Public Health Department of the Municipal Council, in the past few months, there have been several deaths in Shanghai due to eating puffer fish (also known as fish tiger or bag fish). Certain parts of this fish's body contain toxins, especially its gills and reproductive organs, so Chinese vendors have long been prohibited from selling it in the Municipal Council-run or other food markets. However, some people regard this fish as a delicacy, but scientific works on this fish recognize that it is indeed poisonous. However, the Health Bureau feels that it cannot ban private sales. It specifically advises those who insist on buying and eating this fish to completely burn the discarded meat scraps and other inedible parts, so that beggars and others who collect scraps for food will not be poisoned and die.

### Municipal Government Bans Unhygienic Cold Drinks

The Municipal Government Police Health Authorities are paying attention to summer hygiene to prevent the occurrence of epidemics and are banning unhygienic summer cold drinks and cut or peeled melons and fruits. They have issued a joint notice in the urban area, stating that epidemics have spread in Siam, India, and other places this year, and Shanghai is worried about being affected. Therefore, from now on, vendors who sell cold drinks such as ice cream, shaved ice, soda, sour plum soup, etc., must not sell them without being inspected and approved by the Health Testing Institute and obtaining a license. As for cut or peeled melons and fruits, they are easily contaminated by flies and become infected with bacteria, so they are also prohibited. Otherwise, if discovered, the unhygienic cold drinks and melons and fruits will be confiscated and destroyed, and severe penalties will be imposed. The bureau and others will send personnel to conduct random inspections at any time to warn those who neglect their duties.

### Ancient Stone and Pottery Exhibition Held This Afternoon

### Jiangwan Police Station Bans Lunar New Year's Bad Customs

Since Director Tai Dong took over the Jiangwan Police Station of the Municipal Police Bureau at the beginning of last month, he has actively rectified police discipline. In addition to strengthening the daily inspection work, he has been rewarding and punishing fairly. If any acts of corruption or extortion are discovered, they will be dismissed immediately. Therefore, the morale has been high, and the local people have praised the situation. However, as the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, the Director is afraid that his subordinates may still have accumulated bad habits and extort illegal fees from merchants and people. Therefore, he has reiterated warnings. If any such activities are discovered, they will be dismissed without warning to eliminate bad habits.

### YWCA Members' Variety Show

In order to connect the feelings of members of various departments and promote unity among members of various departments, the Shanghai YWCA specially launched a garden variety show for members of various departments, which was scheduled to be held in the association's garden. Unfortunately, the weather was unfavorable, and there was a drizzle yesterday, so the show was moved to the auditorium. However, the guests were still very enthusiastic. Snacks and the order of the variety show were all prepared by members of various departments. The meeting started at 5:00 PM. First, Chairman Cao Chentao's wife gave a speech, and President Ling Xianyang's wife gave a welcome speech to the members of various departments and guests. Next, Ms. Mai Dalong played the piano, and the children's dance class of the association performed children's dances, solo dances, and humorous performances. All kinds of programs were extremely moving and eye-catching. Finally, the Family Industrial Society presented samples of Invincible Brand White Toothpaste, and the meeting was dismissed. In addition, the National Products Promotion Committee of the association invited the China National Products Company to the meeting to display national products in order to promote national products and introduce members to national products. The guests were very interested in national products.

### Sun Shaoqing and Wife's Appeal Case Concluded Yesterday

Sun Absolutely Denies All Charges; Lawyer Requests Innocence to be Declared

Sun Shaoqing, a native of Tongzhou, previously colluded with Jiang Zhaozhou to organize the Shuguang Law Firm, taking on all kinds of lawsuits and using various threatening means to intimidate the opposing parties' lawyers and other parties to achieve their fraudulent purposes. After being reported, Lu Liankui, Chief Inspector of the General Investigation Office of the Public Concession Police, and Detective Liu Shaokui arrested Sun. It was found that Sun had taken on a number of lawsuits, including Lu Zhushuang suing Lu Guanzeng, Jiang Guopei suing Jiang Yangshi, and Pan Xueyan suing Xu Maochang, all of which had defrauded money through intimidation, totaling approximately tens of thousands of yuan. His wife, Sun Zhu, was also involved in joint perjury. They were jointly prosecuted in the First District Court. The Criminal Division Chief Qian Hongye tried the case and sentenced Sun Shaoqing to five years in prison for continuous intimidation and fraud, with a fine of one thousand yuan and deprivation of political rights for ten years. Sun Zhu was sentenced to one year in prison for perjury. Sun and his wife refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyers Chen Ying, Huang Danwen, and Lu Qi to file separate appeals with the Second Branch of the High Court. The grounds for their appeals were several thousand words long, and the content was entirely to exonerate Sun from guilt, claiming that Jiang Zhaozhou and Fang Nianxuan had framed him for failing to defraud him and requesting that the original verdict be revoked and he be declared innocent. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard by Presiding Judge Yu Hua, along with Judges Zhou Han and Nie Chongyi, Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, and Clerk Guan Zhiliang of the Second Branch of the High Court in the First Criminal Division. According to Sun Shaoqing's testimony, he is currently a foreman at the Huishan Wharf and has been law-abiding and self-sufficient. It can be proven by the fact that I have been driving a car for many years and have never violated regulations or caused accidents. As for introducing lawyers to friends or mediating from the middle, it does exist. However, there is absolutely no such thing as taking on lawsuits, intimidating, or defrauding people. It is entirely framed by my cousin Fang Nianxuan and others. The original trial did not give me a chance to defend myself and hastily sentenced me to severe punishment, which is difficult to accept. That is why I am filing an appeal with your court, requesting the presiding judge to investigate the facts in detail and declare me innocent. Sun Zhu also testified that regarding the Wu Yuee case, the court summoned me to testify and I testified to the court based on what I could remember. There was no false statement. It can be investigated. The original trial's determination was inappropriate, so I am appealing and requesting a verdict of innocence. The court then questioned Sun one by one on the various cases prosecuted by the police, but Sun denied everything, or claimed not to know, or attributed it to Tang Jiazhu, Jiang Zhaozhou, Wang Zhenchuan, and others, saying that it had nothing to do with him. After the court questioned him for a long time, and the facts were clear, he ordered the debate to begin. Gan Jingxian, the lawyer representing the Public Concession Police, argued that the original trial's determination of the appellants' crimes was without error and the sentence was appropriate and there was nothing wrong. Therefore, the appellant's appeal was without merit and requested that the original verdict be upheld and the appeal be dismissed. Finally, the appellants' lawyers defended the two appellants separately, and their conclusion was to request that the original verdict be revoked and innocence be declared. Presiding Judge Yu, after reporting to the court, immediately announced the end of the debate in this case and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 18th of this month.

### Shen Junru and Others' Defense Statement (5)

㊃ In the fourth section of the indictment, it is stated that in the eighth section, the defendants' slogans are said to have originated from the resolutions of the Third International. Both sections are speculative words fabricated by the county, attempting to slander the patriotic movement by claiming it is being manipulated by others. Their conclusions are similar in nature, and a unified defense is provided below: (A) In the fourth section of the indictment, it is argued that the slogans used by the National Salvation Association, such as "United Front" and "People's National Salvation Front," are the same as "People's Front." In the eighth section, it is argued that the "People's Front" is a slogan passed by the Seventh Congress of the Third International, implying that the defendants have an international background and political ambitions. In reality, these slogans originated from the resolutions of the Second International Congress. However, the indictment lists seven types of slogans used in the publications of the National Salvation Association, and it never found the "People's Front" slogan. Therefore, the names are already different. Furthermore, the indictment does not mention anything about the meaning or content of the various fronts used in the National Salvation Association's publications. It is unknown what logic is used to determine that they are the same as the "People's Front." Upon investigation, the main purpose of the various fronts used in the publications of the National Salvation Association is to unite the entire nation to resist the enemy and save the country. This can be clearly understood by examining the context of each name. It should not be confused with fronts promoted by other countries. For example: (子) "'Sincere cooperation' is not our propaganda material, but our pure motive and our basic creed. Only under the premise of resisting Japan can the Chinese people cooperate sincerely with love and affection, and then can we establish a great People's National Salvation Front" (see page 5 of the declaration). (丑) "The congress believes that the past authorities' discrimination against other smaller ethnic groups has led them to break away from the national front and even become the strength of others" (see page 2 of the political program). (寅) "The main purpose of the united front is to expand the ranks of resisting Japan and saving the country" (see page 9 of the booklet "Unite to Resist Aggression"). "The meaning of the united front is to unite all parties and factions horizontally, and to unite all strata of society vertically to deal with the common enemy. Such expanded unity requires extreme sincerity and extreme tolerance" (see page 15 of the Congress Work Review). (卯) "Because history tells us that many countries have promoted internal unity through victories in foreign wars, it seems that the national united front is by no means a short-lived transitional combination. The only question is whether our attitude towards participating in the united front is enthusiastic enough, and whether our belief in the inevitable victory of resisting Japan and saving the country is firm enough" (see page 10 of the booklet "Unite to Resist Aggression"). (辰) "In the past five months, the National Salvation Front has constantly pointed out that the main purpose of Japan's continental policy is to destroy all of China. The only way for us to save the country and survive is to unite the whole country immediately and devote all our efforts to resist the enemy" (see page 1 of the declaration). (己) "We dare to swear that we will continue to stand firmly on the position of this national salvation front in the future, without evading, without retreating, without abandoning our position, and without wavering our will, until the Chinese nation's liberation movement achieves complete victory" (see page 5 of the booklet "Unite to Resist Aggression"). The above are the various fronts used in the National Salvation Association documents listed in the indictment. Try to see if their content seeks to unite the Chinese nation to resist the enemy and save the country, or if it is based on the resolutions of the Third International as claimed in the indictment. In addition to the various fronts cited in the above indictment, the National Salvation Association documents also contain other fronts with the same content and even more obvious meanings, which were intentionally omitted by the indictment, such as: (午) Anti-Japanese Front (see page 7 and page 11 of the political program), (未) Resist-the-Enemy Front (see page 11 of the political program), (申) National Salvation Front (see page 7 of the political program), (酉) Chinese Anti-Japanese United Front (see page 7 of the political program), (戌) National Salvation United Front (see page 6 of the booklet "Unite to Resist Aggression"), (亥) National Front (see page 2 of the same booklet). All of these can be intuitively recognized as referring to uniting the entire nation to resist Japan. The indictment not only does not pay attention to the content of the various fronts listed in the National Salvation Association documents at all,

### Private Seal of a Friend, Issuing Checks, Impersonating Uncle to Defraud Money

Uncle Reported, Search Found Savings Account Book Photos and Fabricated Letters as Evidence

Yang Zibin, a local resident of Shanghai, 23 years old, residing at No. 49 Limahu Road, 16th Section, met Li Wenbin, a student from Wuxi, while studying at the Sino-French School. Their relationship was very close. Li later worked as a teacher at Louis Elementary School. Unexpectedly, he secretly engraved Yang Zibin's seal and obtained a checkbook from Huizhong Bank. He issued checks in Yang Zibin's name to Zhongxi Bookstore for discounting, totaling more than 1,000 yuan in thirteen checks. When they were due, they could not be cashed. He then fabricated letters in Yang's name to Zhongxi Bookstore, requesting a postponement of prosecution. Li himself then disappeared and fled. However, Li Wenbin's uncle, Li Wenlin, is the owner of Liangxi Hotel. Li Wenbin had the absurd idea of writing letters to his uncle, threatening him and extorting money. His uncle reported him to the police. A Huizhong Bank savings account book, a photo taken under a false name, and fabricated letters were found. Yang then learned that Li Wenbin was using Zhang Guan Li Dai's method to defraud money under a false name and frame others. He hired lawyer Cheng Zhengping to publish a warning. At the same time, Li Wenbin's incident of issuing checks under a false name caused Yang Zibin to be involved in a lawsuit. Therefore, Yang Zibin hired lawyer Cheng to sue Li Wenbin for fraud and obtaining property in the local court, requesting that he be wanted and prosecuted.

### Japanese and Korean Defendants in Counterfeit Coin Case Appeared in Court for Cross-Examination Yesterday

Japanese Defendant Hosokawa Manipulated Shanghai Dialect to Confess Everything, Case Needs Further Investigation, Rescheduled Hearing

The counterfeit Central, China, and Communications Banknote factory at No. 61 and 63 Kang Nao Road was seized by the Chief Inspector's Office. The arrested Japanese and Korean defendants have been sent to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation. The four Suzhou defendants, Lin Shizhong, etc., along with the evidence, have been sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing. Sun Shaoshan (also known as Wang Shisheng), who was convicted of imprisonment by the Second Special Court in connection with this case, and his concubine Chen Erbao were also transferred to the court by the French Concession Police. Hosokawa Hidesaburo, a Japanese national detained at the Japanese Consulate, and Jeon Woo-soo, a Korean national, were also brought to court to testify. Judge Chuan Lin opened the hearing and questioned them. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police first stated the recent investigation process, saying that Sun Shaoshan invited Hosokawa to cooperate in counterfeiting banknotes on the first of this month. Hosokawa then invited Jeon Woo-soo to participate, and Sun and Jeon raised capital, which was handed over to Hosokawa to purchase printing machines in Japan and transport them to Shanghai. The installation was just completed when Sun and his concubine were arrested for the case. Later, a Zhang surnamed military officer from Sichuan took over the financing and continued the operation. It was planned that the fake banknotes would be sold to the communist area by a Liu surnamed member of the security regiment. However, the investigation needs to be continued, so it is still requested that after the testimony of the witnesses Hosokawa, etc., an extension of one week be granted. Then, the Japanese Hosokawa used the Shanghai dialect to confess the process of his contact with Sun Shaoshan and others to counterfeit banknotes, and pointed out the work undertaken by the defendants Lin Shizhong and Qian Jinfu. He insisted that there was no relationship with the two defendants Shen Laofu and Zhou Konghe. He did not mention Mr. Liu and expressed his indignation, saying that the case was actually solved by Liu leaking information. Next, Jeon Woo-soo used Japanese to translate the details of his participation in this illegal activity and his repeated contact with Sun Shaoshan and others to use fake banknotes. By the time it was over, it was noon. Judge Fu adjourned the hearing and rescheduled it. Hosokawa and Jeon Woo-soo were sent back to the Japanese Consulate, Shen and Zhou were still released on bail, and the other defendants were still detained.

### Repeat Offender Shen Axiang Appealed and Then Requested Withdrawal

After Being Advised by a Pro Bono Lawyer, He Declared to Request Withdrawal

At 7:30 p.m. on April 29 this year, Yang Arong, who lived in Hongkou, hired a rickshaw and was traveling along Lao Chengan Street in the French Concession, when he was robbed by two bandits from Ningbo, Shen Axiang (42 years old), etc. Shen reached into his own pocket and made a gesture as if he was pulling out a pistol to threaten him. As a result, a wallet containing 57 yuan in banknotes was robbed. Yang called for help after the incident, and detective Chen Jinshan arrested Shen Axiang and sent him to the Second Special Court. The police department prosecuted him for crimes such as intimidation and robbery. After Judge Sun Pengxian's trial, Shen had committed crimes before and was released not long ago, so he sentenced Yan Axiang, a repeat offender, to one year and six months of imprisonment for intimidation. Shen refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The collegiate panel held a hearing the other day and appointed lawyer Xu Wufang to provide pro bono defense. After questioning Shen's reasons for appeal and the facts of the crime, the court ordered the opening of the debate. Wang Ren, the prosecutor, first stated his opinion, saying that according to the trial situation, the defendant had actually committed robbery. The original trial's sentence for intimidation was inappropriate. Please sentence him according to the law. Lawyer Xu Wufang then requested the court to ask the appellant's opinion before the debate began. The court approved it. Xu then enlightened the appellant Shen Axiang, saying, "According to the prosecutor's statement, you actually committed robbery. The original trial's sentence for intimidation was already lenient to you. If you must appeal, if you are sentenced for robbery, the imprisonment will be more than one year and six months. Whether you want to appeal or not is your own decision." Shen listened to lawyer Xu's words, bowed his head and thought for a moment, and then declared to the court that he requested to withdraw the appeal. The presiding judge approved it and ordered him to be sent back to prison to await execution.

According to his confession, his name is Ho Futian, 28 years old, from Hubei. The rest of his words were ambiguous. He was ordered to be detained for investigation and verification.
