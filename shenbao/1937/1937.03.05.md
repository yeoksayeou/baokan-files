(Paris) News of Dr. Wang Chonghui, former judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, being appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese National Government, has aroused great interest among experts in Far Eastern affairs here.

### British Ambassador Visits Chairman Wang

(Paris) "Le Temps" published an article by the renowned Far Eastern affairs reporter Duboisque, commenting on the speech delivered by Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Council of the Chinese Kuomintang, at the Central Memorial Week on January 18 after returning to China. It stated, "China has now entered a new era, which is a confirmed fact." In Wang's speech, there was a section mentioning the Chinese Communist Party's intention to cooperate with the central government to resist foreign aggression. Duboisque expressed doubt about the sincerity of the Communist Party and specifically pointed this out in his article. He believed that "When the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held in Nanjing last month, it passed a resolution to eradicate the Communist scourge and advocated continuing President Chiang's policy of suppressing the Communists. This view is the same as Wang Jingwei's. Some people in China believe that the Kuomintang today should restore the teachings of President Sun and implement the policy of alliance with Russia and tolerance of the Communists. This is a misunderstanding of President Sun's original intention. When President Sun was alive, although he deeply admired the Soviet revolutionary leader Lenin and once experimented with the policy of workers and peasants in Guangdong Province, Sun and his associates never imagined that China's fate should be closely linked with Russia." Duboisque went on to mention Wang's speech regarding Japan, saying, "Wang's views are the same as the hopes of most politicians in China, hoping to resist foreign aggression but only after restoring domestic order... On the Japanese side, since General Hayashi came out to form a cabinet, there is a tendency to adopt a policy of coordination with China. After the selection of the new Japanese Foreign Minister, this trend will surely be further enhanced." (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Significance of Developing Hainan Island in National Defense

— Li

Since the Beihai Incident occurred last year, when Japan once sent warships to Haikou on Hainan Island, the eyes of the Chinese people have gradually focused on our country's only large island. In November of last year, Song Ziwen personally inspected the island and planned its development. In January of this year, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction formulated a four-phase plan for the development of Hainan Island, preparing to implement it in stages. Recently, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce invited various sectors from Shanghai and Guangdong to jointly form a Hainan Island Industrial Inspection Group to conduct a thorough inspection of the island, preparing to invest in industries in the future. Although the implementation of concrete plans still requires a long-term planning process, the domestic industrial sector's keen interest in the island is commendable.

Hainan Island is located in the subtropics, and it has all kinds of important products. Mineral resources such as gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, and salt are abundant. Agricultural products such as rice, sugarcane, rubber trees, coconuts, and coffee are also produced in large quantities. The forests of Ganen, Jiangchang, Yaxian, Lingshui, Wanning, Ding'an, Huile, and other counties are vast and boundless. Furthermore, due to being surrounded by the sea, there are many fish. Between Hainan Island and the Philippines and Annam, there is a fishing area of 5,400 square miles, which is one of the world's major fishing grounds. From an economic point of view, this is indeed a place that cannot be ignored.

Not only that, Hainan Island also has a very important significance in national defense. Yulin Port in Yaxian in the south is a natural and excellent naval port. The depth of the water and the perilousness of the terrain are both above Sandu Ao in Fujian. If it can be managed properly, it will certainly become a base for our country's southern navy. At a time when many important military ports in northern China have already fallen, the significance of managing this military port as the first line of national defense in South China is very great. Precisely because of this, Hainan Island has also become coveted by strong neighbors. The Japanese, Ishihara, in his book "Observing Hainan Island from a Military Perspective," said, "Hainan Island is a base of operations for South China, especially for Guangdong and Guangxi... The position of Hainan Island, in any case, has a dominant effect on the landing of troops in Guangdong and Guangxi, as well as on maritime traffic and trade." The conclusion of the article also says, "If Yulin Port on the island can become a major military port that Japan can freely use, then Japan can concentrate its fleet in the port in a short period of time and render Hong Kong's military value ineffective in one fell swoop, causing the French fleet in Saigon to lie dormant and dare not appear. Before the arrival of the superior American fleet, it will have already controlled the South China Sea in its hands."

Just looking at this article, one can imagine that Hainan Island has already become a target of Japan's southward policy. For the sake of consolidating our southern national defense, for the sake of economic self-reliance, we must hurry up and develop Hainan Island. No matter how huge the capital to be spent and how terrible the resistance to be encountered, this semi-barren island is always worth our full efforts to build. Because on the path of China's rejuvenation, this arduous construction is an essential stage.

### New Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Studies Policies to Overcome Difficulties

Plans to Restore Friendships Lost When Withdrawing from the League of Nations; Military Preparations to Repel Foreign Aggression Should Not Be Used for Aggression

(Tokyo) Sato Naotake, because his opinions on domestic and foreign policies, especially regarding foreign policy, are consistent with those of Prime Minister Hayashi and Army Minister Sugiyama, took office as Foreign Minister and clarified his fundamental foreign policy at the cabinet meeting on the evening of the 3rd. The contents are roughly as follows: The current situation in East Asia, centered on Japan, is not optimistic. The key to overcoming this difficulty lies in the right or wrong of Japan's future actions. Therefore, Japanese diplomacy should always implement policies under a clear direction, based on the concept of international justice. When implementing them, a close understanding should be established between the military, diplomatic authorities, political parties, and various ministries, and they should advance with their collective strength and implement national policies. Then, in the near future, it will be possible to dispel the misunderstandings of various countries, and it will inevitably be possible to overcome difficulties. Moreover, with the Japan-Germany Anti-Communist Agreement, it is not difficult to restore the friendship of the allies lost by withdrawing from the League of Nations. The future is broad. Furthermore, diplomacy is for protecting the legitimate development of the country, so it should not be without sufficient military preparations as its background, but military preparations are always the power to repel foreign aggression and should not be military preparations for implementing aggression. Based on this fundamental policy, Foreign Minister Sato plans to expand the existing trilateral conference of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry, consider ways for all cabinet members to cooperate in implementing foreign policy, and clarify his foreign policy aspirations at an appropriate time. (Allied Press dispatch, 4th)

(Tokyo) After holding his inaugural ceremony on the evening of the 3rd, Foreign Minister Sato spoke about his ambitions in the Diet, saying, "As a result of my appointment as Foreign Minister, some people may think that there will be drastic changes in Japanese diplomacy. However, in my opinion, countries and countries exist permanently. The diplomatic policy of a country should not be changed frequently. It is necessary for a country to establish a diplomatic policy and maintain some continuity. In this regard, my personal views or policies when I was an ambassador stationed abroad, whether they can be fully adopted when I take office as the head of foreign affairs today, remain to be studied. Especially in terms of the continuity of the Japanese government's foreign policy, there is a need for further consideration. Therefore, after studying the foreign policy of the previous cabinet, if there are any that should be maintained in continuity, they will still follow that policy without change. However, as things change, those that need to be changed will of course be fully considered. In short, I will exchange views with the cabinet members, formulate an overall policy, and strive to implement it. This is what I hope for." (Allied Press dispatch, 4th)

(Tokyo) Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Naotake returned to Tokyo and was appointed Foreign Minister after only one night, which shows how urgently the Hayashi Tenjūrō cabinet needed a full-time Foreign Minister. Sato has served in the diplomatic world for 36 years, of which 31 years have been spent far away in foreign countries, and in China, he only served as Consul in Harbin for three years in 1914. In terms of Sato's service time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is one year more than Hirota. When he took office as Ambassador to France four years ago, he once traveled to China for only three weeks. Therefore, many Japanese people believe that Sato not only does not have a correct understanding of the situation in China, but also lacks a full understanding of the actual political situation in his own country. However, because he has been stationed in Europe for a long time as a diplomat, his views and thoughts are not different from those who have lived in a corner of East Asia for a long time. Therefore, there are quite a few people who expect that there will be a practical performance in the future "Sato diplomacy." Judging from the general situation, the current diplomatic trend of Japan cannot be completely dominated by the Foreign Minister. Sato's diplomatic methods and extent may be slightly different from other Foreign Ministers, but there cannot be a 180-degree change, which goes without saying. Indeed, the activities of the forces behind Sato are more worthy of our attention than Sato's own policies. Sato's opinion expressed last night after taking office as Foreign Minister, namely, "The diplomatic policy of a country must have continuity," can prove this. As for the selection of the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, it will not be decided until after the parliament is closed, but if Shiratori Toshio is appointed, the future diplomatic trend will be clearer. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)

(Tokyo) In order to revitalize diplomacy, the new Foreign Minister Sato is scheduled to implement a large-scale change in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the ambassadors stationed abroad in the near future. Because His Highness Prince Chichibu will travel to Europe, there is a particular need to appoint a successor as soon as possible. It is internally decided to appoint the current Ambassador to Italy Sugimura Yotaro as Ambassador to France, and at the same time appoint Horita, Minister to Switzerland, to succeed Sugimura's original position. (Allied Press dispatch, 4th)

(London) The appointment of Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Naotake as Foreign Minister has been praised by observers here, who say that Sato is extremely familiar with European affairs and has been stationed in France for many years. Therefore, his promotion to Foreign Minister is a sign that Japan has a tendency to promote ties with France. However, the general trend of Japanese foreign policy will not undergo major changes as a result of this, because the Hayashi cabinet has already stated that its foreign policy should remain as it was. However, if Sato can achieve the following two things after taking office, the British government will certainly be very satisfied. One is the case last year when British sailors were abused by the Japanese authorities in Keelung Port, Taiwan, which caused protests from the British side. This case has been delayed for several months and has not been resolved. In the future, it is hoped that the Japanese government can find a way to solve this case. The second is that since the United Kingdom, the United States, and France signed the London Naval Treaty in March of last year, Japan has not accepted the qualitative restrictions stipulated in the treaty. Therefore, it is hoped that the Japanese Navy Ministry can accept these restrictions and sign the treaty before the end of this month. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)

(Berlin) The appointment of Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Naotake as Foreign Minister has elicited few comments from people familiar with Far Eastern affairs, who only praise Sato's diplomatic talents, saying that Sato is one of the most outstanding figures in the old-school diplomatic circles in Japan and belongs to the faction that supports the League of Nations. He has represented the Japanese government at the League of Nations on several occasions, until Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. During the Sino-Japanese Manchurian Incident in 1931, Sato played a crucial role in Geneva's extremely delicate negotiations, maintaining Japanese interests. His effectiveness was remarkable. As Ambassador to France in Paris, his mission was extremely difficult, because France and Russia have been approaching each other in recent years, while the relationship between Japan and Russia has been quite tense. Sato's situation was difficult to cope with. However, until Sato left France, the French people still had great sympathy for him. This could not have been achieved without Sato's extraordinary agility. In addition, general observers believe that Sato has a good feeling for the League of Nations and has been stationed in France for many years. After he takes office as Foreign Minister, he may improve the relations between Japan and France, which may affect the friendship between Japan and Germany. Therefore, they are quite uneasy, which is the same as the uneasiness of the German people when Baron Ishii, the former Japanese Ambassador to France, was promoted to Foreign Minister in previous years. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)

(Paris) After the promotion of Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Naotake to Foreign Minister, Le Petit Parisien commented, "The French officialdom is extremely pleased with this move, because Ambassador Sato is a close friend of France. He has been stationed in France for four years and has a great deal of sympathy for France. His talent for diplomatic negotiation is also unmatched. His departure is not something that can be forgotten in a moment." The newspaper recounted Sato's experience, stating that he had served as a counselor in the Japanese Embassy in Russia for many years before the European War and was very familiar with the situation in Russia. Now that he has been promoted to Foreign Minister, he will certainly be able to use this experience and make contributions. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 4th)

(Geneva) After the news that Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Naotake had been appointed Foreign Minister of the country reached here, people from the League of Nations warmly welcomed the news, believing that it was a good thing for Japan, and that it would also benefit world peace. Sato never ceases to think about world peace. Furthermore, after Sato's promotion to Foreign Minister, Japan and the technical groups affiliated with the International Association will certainly continue to cooperate. For example, the meeting of the presidium of the Disarmament Conference is scheduled to be held on May 6 of this year, and Japan will definitely send representatives to participate. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 4th)

### Ambassador Xu Hosts Japanese People

A Grand Occasion

(Tokyo) The Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, held a tea party at the Chinese Embassy this afternoon to entertain leaders from all walks of life in Japan. In addition to important officials from various ministries of the Japanese government, famous figures from the political, diplomatic, business, educational, and other fields in Japan, both in and out of government, participated, totaling more than 200 people. It was truly a rare grand gathering in Tokyo in recent years. Among the guests, Yoshizawa, Obata, Debuchi, Kodama, and Kadono all expressed their hope that Ambassador Xu would be able to return to his post soon after his upcoming return to the country. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)

### US Senate Passes New Neutrality Law

Also Effective in Civil Wars; President Has Deciding Power

(Washington) The Senate today passed the government's proposed Neutrality Law by a vote of 62 to 6, and it was immediately sent to the House for review. The contents of the bill include the following eight points:

1.  All arms, ammunition, and military supplies must be prohibited from export.
2.  Whether other items are prohibited or not is decided by the President.
3.  For belligerent groups, the export of any goods must be prohibited. If a foreign government or agent purchases them and transports them to the belligerent groups, they cannot be prohibited.
4.  Loans to belligerent groups are prohibited.
5.  American citizens are prohibited from traveling on belligerent group ships.
6.  The President has the right to decide whether or not to prohibit belligerent groups from using American ports to transport food.
7.  Armed American ships are prohibited from entering belligerent group ports.
8.  Both sides of a civil war may be considered belligerent groups.

Senator Borah said at the end of the debate that the bill abandoned the maritime freedom policy that the United States has always adhered to, and that the result would be the disregard and attack of other countries. Senator Johnson also opposed the bill's "cash and carry method" and reiterated Borah's words, saying that the United States would be forced to unite with Britain in the Atlantic and with Japan in the Pacific, because Britain and Japan both have strong navies. (National News Agency dispatch, 3rd)

(Washington) The Neutrality Law passed by the Senate today was proposed by Pittman. The highlight of today's discussion was the Republican senators Borah and Vandenberg attacking the United States for abandoning oceanic liberalism. Republican Senator Johnson said that the passage of the bill would be equivalent to depriving Congress of its power to declare war, which is Congress's final and most important responsibility. The various clauses contained in the law will automatically take effect at any time after the President declares the existence of a state of war, and the President also has the right to prohibit American ships from transporting any materials that may endanger the peace of the United States at will. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 2nd)

(Washington) An amendment was added, stipulating that if American merchant ships load any items that are prohibited from being transported to belligerent countries under the Neutrality Law, the American government will not protect the merchant ships. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)

### Roosevelt's Banquet for Quezon

Preparing for Economic Conference

(Washington) Philippine President Quezon told reporters today that he intends to invite President Roosevelt to visit the Philippines, and expressed his gratitude for President Roosevelt's luncheon today. (3rd National Electric)

(Washington) President Roosevelt hosted a luncheon today for Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon. Among those invited to accompany were Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Swanson, Secretary of War Woodring, and nineteen other high-ranking officials. This indicates that the future economic negotiations between the United States and the Philippines will be of great importance. The Secretaries of State, Navy, and War will have a significant impact on future U.S. commercial, naval, and military policies related to the Philippines. Undersecretary of State Sayre told the Associated Press today that the two-and-a-half-hour conversation with Quezon was very satisfactory, and that further talks would continue. (3rd National Electric)

(Washington) Several of the most powerful agricultural groups in the country have today informally united to oppose the amendment of the Philippine Independence Act, in order to avoid being detrimental to American farmers. It is reported that representatives of agricultural commissions from thirteen southern states, who are politically influential, are participating in this movement and have begun an "educational campaign" to ensure that national agricultural leaders understand the relationship between the United States and the Philippines. The most important points are approximately as follows:

㊀ U.S.-Philippine trade currently has the U.S. in a trade surplus position.

㊁ Filipinos tend to purchase more goods from other countries.

㊂ If the United States makes further concessions to the Philippines, American farmers of rubber, vegetable oil, and sugar will be greatly affected. A spokesperson for these groups stated that if the Independence Act is amended, Congress will not pass anything detrimental to American farmers. Agricultural groups have always supported the Independence Act because it stipulates that after the Philippines becomes independent, its status will be equal to that of other independent nations.

### Britain Willing to Cooperate with U.S. to Create World Peace

Lord Privy Seal Advocates Expanding Armaments, Hoping to Generate Stable Power in Europe

(London) Lord Privy Seal Halifax declared in the House of Lords today, "Our efforts, whether in diplomacy, military affairs, or industry, are all based on a single goal, namely, to build peace on the foundation of justice. Only justice can support the edifice and allow all nations to rest in peace."

Halifax elaborated on the rearmament and described the mission of surveillance ships in the Spanish Civil War, stating that these ships do not have the right to arrest or search, but can only identify the names of ships entering Spanish ports and whether they are complying with the agreement, and allow observers to board the ships. Otherwise, everything else remains the same. The British government is now responsible for protecting its own ships. A member asked whether there were observers from other countries stationed on the warships. Halifax said that the Spanish coast has now been divided into sections, each monitored by warships from different countries, and there seems to be no need for observers from other countries to be stationed on the warships.

Regarding the danger of isolation, Halifax said, "We will neither be isolated nor willingly isolated; it is impossible. How the future will be is difficult to predict, but the current government's policy is very clear."

Halifax added, "I am also quite concerned about the possibility of disputes occurring in Eastern Europe. I have not forgotten that these disputes, related to the Franco-Soviet pact, will trigger an even greater crisis in Western Europe. Therefore, if we are to adopt a certain attitude towards hypothetical disputes in Central and Eastern Europe, it is impossible to say at once that we have put the affairs of Central and Eastern Europe out of our minds. Furthermore, we have repeatedly stated that we are willing to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant, but if these obligations cannot be precisely defined, it is a defect of the League of Nations Covenant itself. Although the League of Nations is now weak, British power has not diminished in the slightest, and we are willing to do our best to prevent conflicts from occurring. Some say that Britain's military build-up is due to the imminent threat of future wars, but in fact, we have no such pessimistic thoughts. We firmly believe that the stronger Britain's military is, the less likely war will occur. Britain's military is not a selfish military, nor is it for aggression, but rather, we hope that in the future, a stable power can emerge among the countries of Europe."

Halifax continued, "I know that there will inevitably come a time when a lower level of military balance can be consulted between countries, so as to avoid countries competing in armaments out of necessity. The British government also deeply hopes that this time will come soon. We sincerely welcome agreements that promote peace, no matter when or where. We still firmly believe in the ideals of the League of Nations, but if we do not have the strength to fulfill our duties, it will be in vain."

Halifax concluded that the British government would offer sympathetic assistance to any path that could lead to the realm of peace. Britain has previously dealt with all European issues based on this spirit, and hopes to obtain the cooperation of the United States in this spirit. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 3rd)

### British Army Budget is £82 Million

£26 Million More Than Last Year; Hong Kong to Hold Joint Naval, Land, and Air Exercises

(London) This year's army estimates were released this morning, totaling £63,312,000, an increase of £7,239,000 over last year, including supplementary estimates. £19,054,000 for the equipment and public works expenses of the standing army will be appropriated from the unified fund under the National Defence Loan Act. If this clause is included, the total amount of the army estimates for 1937 will be £82,174,000, which will exceed £26,293,000 over last year. In the memorandum attached to the army estimates, Secretary of War Cooper pointed out that there are two points that make this year's estimates less clear than last year's. The first point is that last year, the construction cost of government factories was £551,800, which was included in the army estimates, but this year, the cost of £794,600 has been changed to the artillery factory estimates, and there is the same amount of subsidy allocated from the unified fund, which is listed in the estimates. The second point is that last year there was a special expense of £2,800,000 related to the Italian-Abyssinian War, but this year this item has been deleted. As for the number of army personnel, excluding those serving in India, the total number is 168,900, compared to 158,400 in 1936 and 186,400 in 1914. This year, a total of 47,200 new recruits are needed. The current number of recruits is not yet sufficient, but Cooper plans to find other ways to remedy this. As it stands, the physical standards have now been modified, and defects in the feet can now be disregarded due to the mechanization of the army. Cooper's memorandum included descriptions of improvements to barracks construction, such as hot air, hot water, and new cooking facilities. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)

(Singapore) Hong Kong will hold joint naval, land, and air exercises within the month. One thousand troops from Singapore will participate, accounting for one of the two battalions of the Singapore garrison. They will travel by submarine HMS Medway, arriving in Hong Kong around March 8 and returning in mid-April. At least one squadron of the Royal Air Force from RAF Seletar will participate, and Air Vice-Marshal Maltby, Commander of the Far East Air Force, will also attend. Furthermore, the current defensive strength of Hong Kong consists of three infantry battalions and units from various corps, such as artillery units, engineering units, and signal units. The artillery units also include two anti-aircraft squadrons, and six aircraft will cooperate with the anti-aircraft units in exercises. It is expected that the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes, carrying twenty fighter planes, will participate as part of the opposing force. Furthermore, the cruiser HMS Cumberland, which remained in the port of Malaya after the Singapore defense exercises, will set sail for Hong Kong on March 10. Other warships participating, in addition to the Medway submarine and the Hermes aircraft carrier, include eleven submarines, eight destroyers, and two small warships, which are already en route to Hong Kong.

### Japan Emphasizes British and American Shipbuilding

Researching Ways to Respond

(Tokyo) The British naval budget for 1937 totals £100,506,500 (an actual increase of £23,776,600 over the previous year). The aim of this new arms expansion plan is to maintain the construction of an invincible navy. The United States' $526 million has been passed by Congress, indicating a determination to build the only modern navy. The shipbuilding competition between the two countries has now taken its first concrete step. The Japanese Navy attaches great importance to this matter and will vigorously expand its independent economic and military preparedness. At the same time, it will quickly implement the Third Supplementary Plan and carefully study the new British and American naval plans that go beyond the quantitative limits stipulated in the Washington and London treaties, and then seek countermeasures.

### Italian Fascist Party's Population Policy

Clever Methods; Encouraging Reproduction

(Rome) The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party continued its meeting last night at 10:00 PM and adjourned at 3:00 AM this morning. First, Minister of the Interior Bottai reported on the population issue, and a resolution was immediately passed to improve the current population policy in accordance with the following principles:

㊀ Those with many children should enjoy priority in seeking employment, because when the country encounters extraordinary circumstances, the families that provide the most men and suffer the greatest sacrifices are those with large populations.

㊁ The size of wages should be proportional to the number of dependents in the family. In other words, for those with the same job and equal performance, the wages earned should be determined by the burden on the family.

㊂ Existing methods used to stabilize the livelihoods of families with large populations should be improved.

㊃ The state should provide marriage loans to those who marry and the state should organize special insurance to protect the lives of workers' widows.

㊄ A national federation should be organized for families with large populations.

㊅ The boundaries of provinces, villages, and towns should be re-demarcated in accordance with the latest population statistics, and those with too many elderly people and a declining population should be immediately abolished.

㊅ A central agency should be established to promote and monitor the implementation of population policies.

This resolution believes that without people, the country has no youth, no military strength, no economic development, no security, and no future. Therefore, the population issue is called "the greatest of all problems." (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)

### Italian Veterans to Assemble Next Month

### Singapore Naval Base to Be Fully Completed in Two Years

Total Cost: £11 Million

(London) The Singapore naval base aroused heated debate in the House of Commons today. First, Labour MP Sorensen inquired about when the construction would be completed and certain financial details. Civil Lord of the Admiralty Lindsay, representing the government, replied that the port should be completed in the 1939 fiscal year. As for the cost, as of the end of January this year, it was £5,856,000, and the total cost is estimated to be £11 million. Lindsay also said that so far, there have been no difficulties in obtaining the steel needed for construction.

Then, Labour MP Griffiths asked whether the port would be built before the Second World War or after the Second World War. Everyone laughed. Conservative MP Williams immediately asked whether the Labour MPs had always opposed the construction of the naval base. Lindsay did not say a word. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 3rd)

### Why Are Important Figures from the Italian Fascist Party Going to Spain?

Bearing Important Secret Missions; German Ambassador Presents Credentials to Rebel Army

"The number of munitions manufactured in Mexico is limited, and it is insufficient to continuously assist the Spanish government army. According to certain sources, a certain country in the Far East, although claiming to be a friend of the Spanish National Army, is now transporting munitions to Mexico to supply to the Spanish government army." (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)

◎ Burgos: The new German ambassador to Spain, General Faupel, today presented his credentials to General Franco of the Spanish National Army government and conveyed the heartfelt wishes of Führer Hitler, saying that Germany deeply sympathizes with the Spanish people's struggle for freedom. The rule of the Communist Party is one of assassination and destruction. Germany believes that the harmony of the people at home is the foundation of international harmony. Communism and class hatred can never achieve peace. Only the reconciliation of class interests can achieve peace. Hitler has eliminated class hatred in Germany, and Germany has become a guarantee of peace. The ambassador finally mentioned the centuries-old friendly relations between Germany and Spain, hoping that the Spanish National Army, under the leadership of General Franco, will achieve final victory to establish a solid Spain.

The battle lasted for 23 hours, and the National Army suffered heavy losses. Later, about 30,000 government troops crossed the Tagus River between Talavera and Toledo and advanced on the railway and the highway between Talavera and Toledo, which the National Army relied on as a source of support from the Talavera side. Furthermore, the National Army once attempted to cut off the highway between Madrid and Valencia, but this plan failed. After four hours of shelling and charging, the National Army retreated to its original defensive line, and the ground was covered with corpses. The government also claimed that the area west of Oviedo city has fallen into the hands of the government army, so traffic to Oviedo has been completely cut off by the government army. However, according to news from the National Army, 400 militiamen from the government side have surrendered to the National Army on the west bank of the Tagus River. They were forcibly conscripted from Valencia and sent to the front immediately after joining the army. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)

◎ Madrid: Regarding the news reported by the Luz newspaper that the government army had entered Toledo, a city south of the capital, General Miaja, chairman of the Defense Committee, recently stated that this news has not yet been confirmed.

### Impressions of the 96th Session of the League of Nations Council

Satisfactory Results on Important Issues, Ambassador Gu Highly Praised by All Countries

Geneva Correspondence: The 96th session of the League of Nations Council has concluded. It was held six times from January 21st to 28th. This was the first council meeting of the year. Although the meeting encountered considerable difficulties, it achieved considerable success. It is not only a glorious record in the history of the League of Nations but also a model for future meetings. European public opinion calls this result a revival of the League of Nations because several important issues were handled appropriately and the results were satisfactory.

First, the Dispute Between Turkey and France

Before the Council meeting, Turkey insisted on the complete independence of the Sanjak of Alexandretta. Negotiations between Turkey and France were nearly deadlocked. A dense fog shrouded the Mediterranean, adding another layer of worry. At that time, there were rumors that Turkey would use force to resolve the issue. If that had happened, the League of Nations would have faced another threat of collapse. However, these two member states did not follow the example of their predecessors, nor did they seek solutions outside the League of Nations. Instead, they entrusted the issue to the Council for resolution, demonstrating their trust in the League of Nations and their adherence to the covenant. The Council's handling of the issue satisfied both parties, and they sincerely accepted it. Thus, an extremely serious problem was averted and brought under the rule of law and culture. As a result, the relations between the two countries returned to normal. In fact, the people of both sides have benefited immensely. This immense benefit was entirely due to trust in the League of Nations and adherence to the covenant, which can serve as an example for the future. Because in the past, if the League of Nations dealt with disputes between two member states with the consent of Country A, it would inevitably be rejected by Country B. There is always one who "obeys the covenant" and one who "breaks the covenant." The Sino-Japanese issue, the Bolivia-Paraguay dispute, and the Italo-Ethiopian War were different, and the countries were of different strengths, but "obeying" and "breaking" are the same. Because there were precedents of breaking the covenant, observers were not optimistic about the Turkish-French issue beforehand. Afterwards, they had infinite hope for the League of Nations.

Second, the Danzig Issue

Since Germany withdrew from the League, the Danzig issue has become increasingly serious, almost becoming the center of conflict between Germany, Poland, and the League of Nations. The power of the German Nazi Party in Danzig is expanding, and those who do not sympathize with the Germanic people face threats of terror. Even League of Nations High Commissioner Sean Lester has been insulted. The "free city" under the rule of the League of Nations has gradually lost its freedom. Danzig, located in northeastern Europe, harbors many crises. This was especially evident during the 93rd session of the Council in October last year. Danzig Senate President Greiser did not speak in the tone of a representative of the citizens at the Council meeting but instead expressed threats on behalf of the Nazi Party. He declared that he would no longer come to Geneva. Therefore, the Danzig issue could not be discussed at the 94th and 95th sessions of the Council. However, Greiser came to Geneva again and appeared at the 96th session. This time, his attitude was very mild and polite. He expressed his agreement with the new High Commissioner appointed by the Council and expressed his willingness to cooperate. He stated that his relationship with the High Commissioner was entirely based on the law. Although this result is related to the political changes in Europe over the past few months, it actually demonstrates the efforts of the Committee of Three. The Council achieved another success.

Third, the Dispute Between Chile and Spain Regarding Refugees

This issue was not originally on the agenda but was initiated by the Chilean representative on an ad hoc basis. The Chilean representative requested the Spanish government to guarantee the safety of refugees seeking asylum in embassies because Chile believed that the Spanish government's massacre of fugitives violated international conventions. The debate between the Chilean and Spanish representatives turned into a heated debate with the Soviet representative, but the Council ultimately achieved the goal of mediation. Chinese representative Gu, as chairman and rapporteur, traveled between the representatives of Chile and Spain dozens of times. With the assistance of Eden (UK) and Delbos (France), everyone worked hard to achieve a satisfactory resolution. Both parties agreed to direct negotiations. This was the last gathering of the session. That afternoon, the Council held a closed meeting, then an open meeting, until it adjourned at 8:30 PM. Representative Gu's report was unanimously adopted by the Council, preventing a minor issue from becoming a major one. It can also be said that the Council achieved another success. Both parties expressed their gratitude for Representative Gu's painstaking mediation efforts.

Fourth, the Issue of Freedom of Speech for Representatives of the Press Stationed at the League of Nations

In recent years, members of the International Association of Journalists stationed at the League of Nations whose articles opposed Fascism have often been suppressed or expelled by the Swiss government. Switzerland, which is universally regarded as the most developed democratic country, seems to have been unable to maintain its spirit of permanent neutrality because it is situated between two major Fascist powers. It has also been unable to fulfill its legal responsibility to protect political prisoners from both countries. However, the aforementioned journalists' association, based on a resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly in 1926, argues that League of Nations member states have a responsibility to ensure that the League understands that without the cooperation of the press, the work of the League and its peaceful purposes cannot be understood by the people of the world. The Swiss government had already accepted the aforementioned resolution at that time, but for several years, it had not interfered with statements that opposed democratic politics or harmed relations with other countries. However, it has uniquely suppressed statements related to Germany and Italy. Council Chairman Gu, after receiving a written statement from the journalists' association, raised the issue for discussion in a closed meeting. The representatives of the Council expressed their indignation and passed a motion to accept and handle the issue, organizing a five-member committee (China, UK, France, Sweden, Poland) to study the matter and report back to the next session. The Council's acceptance of a problem between a private organization and a small country's government is also rare in the history of the League of Nations. Journalists stationed at the League of Nations and the European press regard the attitude of the Council Chairman and the councilors as a manifestation of the League's respect for freedom of speech, which is enough to promote a deeper understanding and sympathy for the League of Nations in public opinion. This can also be considered one of the achievements of this session of the Council. In this unfavorable environment, the Council has achieved satisfactory results on the aforementioned several important issues, and its efforts have not been in vain. Therefore, it has gained special respect from public opinion. On the day the Council adjourned, the Journal de Genève stated: "The 96th session of the Council has adjourned. The League of Nations has never been so vigorous. The 96th session is the most satisfactory. It has restored people's hopes for peace because the councilors can take responsibility and can see the big picture on important issues. At the beginning of 1937, the councilors of the Council took responsibility to ensure that the people of all countries celebrate the guarantee of the League of Nations' peaceful organization..." Speaking of our Representative Gu, the newspaper said: "...The 96th session of the Council has proved the talent of Chairman Gu Weijun... Other newspapers have praised him even more beyond description, praising Representative Gu's keenness and experience no less than praising the League of Nations."

It is noted that this is the third time that our country has taken the chairmanship of the Council. The first time was in 1922 when Representative Gu first served as chairman, the second time was in 1927, when our country's then-Ambassador to France Chen Lu served as chairman, and this time it was Representative Gu's second time as chairman. Mr. Gu was a member of the League of Nations Covenant Drafting Committee seventeen years ago and can be said to be one of the League of Nations' elders. However, people here mostly call him a young diplomat, as his appearance leads them to suspect that he is in his thirties. They do not know that three days after the closing of the session, it will be his 50th birthday. It is thought that Ambassador Gu's return with praise will be even more spiritually pleasant than his friends' birthday wishes. (Central News Agency, Geneva, January 30)

### Bandits in Nan'an, Fujian Province, Collude with Ronin

Multiple Robberies and Murders Occur in Jintao District. Notorious Bandit Huang Sanqi Arrested in Xiamen. Bandits and Ronin Have Secret Organizations

Xiamen Correspondence: Jintao in the second district of Nan'an County, Quanzhou Prefecture, is a border area where the three counties of Anxi, Nan'an, and Yongchun meet. In the past, bandits and communists roamed around, making it notoriously difficult to govern. Last year, after the stationed troops suppressed them, the bandits and communists collapsed, and the local area gradually became peaceful. Unexpectedly, in February of this year, multiple robberies and murders occurred in the Jintao district, and it was discovered that bad elements were colluding with Ronin and had secret organizations. On February 15, the Chen Kaishu and Chen Douchi stores on Xiaxu Street in the district were robbed. The bandits cut off the power lines along the way, creating a very rampant situation. Subsequently, Fang Guo'an, the director of the Qianjin Temple United Security Office in the second district of Nan'an, reported the truth of the incident, stating: "On the 15th of this month, I was ordered by the county government to supervise the chiefs and militiamen to go to the county government for exercises. Unexpectedly, that night, Huang Sanqi from Louxia Township colluded with four Ronin, carrying short guns. They first entered the Huang family's Shisun house in the township, searched for Huang Chi's self-defense Mauser pistol, claiming to be under the orders of the headquarters. When Huang resisted, he was tied up in a nearby dilapidated house. They then went to Xiaxu Street and knocked on the doors of Chen Kaishu and Chen Douchi's stores, pretending to buy things. Three entered the room, and two guarded the door, claiming to collect donations. Suddenly, they claimed to be under the orders of the headquarters to handle a case here and were short of travel expenses, asking to borrow several hundred yuan. They eventually extorted more than two hundred yuan. The merchants immediately sounded the alarm, gathered the militiamen to pursue, but failed to capture them. Huang Chi managed to escape home the next morning. Huang Sanqi was previously wanted. Now, he dares to collude with Ronin to go to the township to tie up and search, which has been reported to the government for strict investigation," and so on. Based on this, it can be proven that local bandits colluded with Ronin. On the 25th, Xie Konghuai of Dongmen Township in Jintao was also robbed of more than 1,300 yuan. In addition, Huang Mao, a general merchandise merchant, went missing in Houkeng Township. His body was later found near the Shen'an United Security Office, stabbed more than seventy times, and the 218 yuan he was carrying was also stolen. After these cases occurred, the district office learned that Huang had come to Xiamen a month ago to lead four Ronin from a certain direction back to Jintao. After the robbery, Huang returned to Xiamen. Fang Guo'an, the director of the second district United Security Office, led two militiamen to Xiamen a few days ago and met with the detective team of the Xiamen Municipal Police Bureau to find out that Huang was hiding in a certain place in Caozaian. At 7:00 PM on March 1, all the detectives went to the address and arrested Huang. He is currently being held at the headquarters, awaiting a letter from the Nan'an County government to transfer him. Huang is a notorious bandit in Jintao, who usually runs rampant in the countryside, and many people have been ravaged by him. This time, he colluded with Ronin, which is especially hated by the villagers. It is also said that the secret organization in Jintao is called the "Action Team," which is an organization of bandits and Ronin from a certain direction. (March 3)

### Poison Also Found in Chaoshan Salt

Salt in Two Salt Factories in Raoping County Sealed Off. Similar to the Poisoned Salt in Southern Fujian Last Month. It is Said That the Poisoning Was Done by Ronin and Traitors.

Shantou Correspondence: The coastal area of Chaoshan is a salt-producing area. Every year, salt is transported and sold to the counties in Chaozhou, Meizhou, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces, totaling more than six million dan, which is a major source of national tax revenue. In recent years, Ronin from a certain country have been causing trouble in the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong, engaging in drug trafficking and smuggling by any means possible. Last month, it was discovered in Putian, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen in Fujian Province that poison had been added to the salt, which alarmed southern Fujian for a time. Unexpectedly, the Xingji and Jitong salt factories in Raoping County in Chaozhou have recently had the same discovery as in southern Fujian. All salt that is white and transparent, crystallized into a rectangular shape, has no salty taste, tastes acidic, slightly bitter, seems to be gelatinous, and melts when exposed to fire. The salt found in the Xingji factory is probably the same as that in Putian and Xinghua in Fujian Province. After the news spread, it was rumored in all counties of Chaoshan, causing panic in the city. The Raoping County government immediately sealed off the salt for thorough chemical examination and investigation. According to a letter from Putian, Fujian Province, three weeks ago, a strange epidemic was discovered in Putian, where patients suffered from abdominal distension, with the belly swelling up like a ball, solid and shiny. Within a day or two, the intestines rotted, and even the belly rotted. Doctors were helpless, and it became an incurable disease. The life expectancy was at most ten days. In Xianyou, Zhangzhou, and other places, dozens of people have died as a result. Later, Xianyou discovered that poison had been added to the salt warehouse. The residents of Zhangzhou and Xiamen checked the salt themselves and also discovered white, crystalline substances. Therefore, last month, there was panic in southern Fujian County. Those who bought salt were all very careful. It has been found that privateers and Ronin often travel to and transport smuggled goods in the salt-producing areas of Nanli, Pinghai, Meizhou, and Dongshan in Fujian Province. Therefore, the people of Fujian unanimously suspect that the poison in the salt must have been done by Ronin from a certain country. Now that similar incidents have been discovered in Raoping, the salt-producing areas of Chaozhou, such as Haishan, Dongjie, Dagang, Fuxun, and Hongmen, are also places where treacherous and Ronin travel. Therefore, the military and political officers of Chaoshan are particularly concerned. According to reports, Division Commander Li Hanhun of the stationed army specially obtained various types of salt from salt-producing areas and salt factories and handed them over to the Shantou Municipal Hospital for chemical examination to determine whether they had been poisoned and what the composition of the poison was. The Shantou Municipal Hospital did not have the necessary equipment for chemical examination. Therefore, Li took them to Guangzhou and handed them over to the Zhongda Medical Department for chemical examination. The Raoping County government has sealed off the Xingji and Jitong salt factories and prohibits them from being sold, awaiting the results of the chemical examination, and has reported the details to the division headquarters, the administrative office, the Fourth Route Army headquarters, the provincial government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and other agencies for filing. It also ordered the subordinate district and township offices to strictly inspect coastal areas for suspicious people poisoning the salt fields.

### Kunshan Actively Prepares to Establish a Sports Association

Since the public sports field in this county was abolished, the promotion of public sports has been lacking. Recently, the county party department was ordered to organize a county sports association and district, township, and town branches. A preparatory committee has now been established, with Zhu Fukang and eight others elected as members to be responsible for actively carrying out the work. They are currently soliciting members and drafting regulations, and it is expected to be established in early April, when national physical training will be implemented.

### Feng Wangyi of Suzhou Arrested for Fraud

Lu Jimei and Lu Pan Quanchun, a wealthy couple on Fenghuang Street in Fengmen, have a deep addiction. The county government has repeatedly ordered them to abstain but they have not complied. They have been arrested and sent to the county hospital for compulsory abstinence. A man named Feng Wangyi, who used to be an adjutant to a certain division stationed in Suzhou, knew that Lu was afraid of being convicted. He contacted Lu, offering to bribe the county's opium suppression authorities and to use his influence in the press to avoid punishment. Lu believed him and agreed to pay 1,000 yuan, with 700 yuan to be used to bribe the county's opium suppression authorities and 300 yuan to be used to influence the press. It was agreed that the money would be paid on the 4th. The county government's opium case investigation office learned of this and sent judges Du and Zhang to the county hospital to arrest Feng Wangyi. They found two Shanghai Bank checks for 500 yuan each on his person. They took Feng Wangyi back to the county government and detained him pending interrogation.

### Preparing to Levy Land Value Tax

Since its establishment, the Wuxian Land Administration Bureau has been gradually completing the task of carrying out land surveying and registration throughout the county. In order to implement the land value tax in the urban area as soon as possible, the county government ordered the Land Administration Bureau on the 4th to submit the names of the landowners who have completed registration in the urban area to the county government by the end of May, so as to prepare all the procedures. As for the investigation of land prices in the urban area, the township and town offices will report them to the county government.

### The Labor Unrest at Changzhou Minfeng Factory Has Not Yet Subsided

On the evening of the 2nd, all the female workers at the Minfeng Yarn Factory outside Xiaonanmen in Wuyi County went on strike. The police bureau sent officers to the factory to maintain order and urged them to return to work.

Feng Jingheng, the representative of the factory, promised to reply again on the 4th. Some of the female workers also dispersed and returned home at night. The factory's strike losses are more than 10,000 yuan per day, and the damage to property is not included.

### Yangzhou Jingcheng Road Limits Demolition of Civilian Houses

The Jingcheng Road in Yangzhou City, which is under construction, has long been surveyed for the road alignment and the bidding has been submitted for approval.

### Shaoxing Builds Cao Hao Wharf

The Shao-Xiao Tangzha Engineering Office previously found that the Cao'e Hao Dam had as many as eleven dry gates built by the Guo Tanghang for loading and unloading goods, which was very dangerous. It was decided to build one or two public wharfs at that place and fill in the original dry gates. The plan has now been drafted and the estimated cost is 5,000 yuan, which will be paid from the annual repair item. It has been submitted to the Department of Construction for approval yesterday.

### Yuyao Prepares to Establish Textile Company

Yuyao cotton is known for its white color and pure quality, with an annual output of over two million dan, ranking first in all of Zhejiang Province. However, the cotton merchants who trade in it often suffer losses. The reason for this is that they are controlled by others and cannot be independent. Yuyao cotton must be transported to Ningbo and undergo drying and inspection. If the drying and inspection are not satisfactory, they will lose at least three or four yuan per pair. Moreover, market prices fluctuate rapidly. These two reasons are the biggest difficulties for Yuyao cotton traders. Shanghai-based Ningbo merchants such as Xu Qianlin, seeing that Zhouxing Town's commerce has become exceptionally prosperous since the establishment of a central station in Ziguan Cao in that town, plan to raise a large amount of capital to establish a textile company in the town, in order to revitalize industry.

Adopting Both Actual Receipt and Payment Systems; Officials to Study in Detail

The Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, in response to a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting the concurrent adoption of an actual receipt and payment system, replied to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: "Regarding your Chamber's official letter No. 320, dated February 20th of this year, concerning the Research Association for the Collection of Income Tax, based on a proposal from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, construction companies that contract for projects may not be able to complete their projects for several years, and payments are also made in installments over several years.

### Zhang Fang Talks About the Severity of the Henan Disaster

Over Nine Million Disaster Victims Awaiting Relief; Report to All Sectors Today

According to Xin Xin News Agency, Zhang Fang, a member of the Central Committee and chairman of the Henan Provincial Accounting Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 27th of last month. He has been visiting various parties in recent days to discuss raising funds for disaster relief. He is scheduled to host a reception for all sectors at 4 p.m. today on the eighth floor of the Hua An Apartment to report on the disaster situation. Zhang will also meet with the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, Song Ziwen and Chen Shang, to discuss ways to implement work relief. After Zhu Qinglan, who is waiting to inspect the disaster area, returns to Shanghai for a meeting, Zhang will return to Henan to preside over disaster relief matters.

Vast Disaster Area

A Xin Xin News Agency reporter visited Zhang at his residence yesterday to inquire about the disaster situation in Henan Province and the implementation of relief measures. According to him, Henan Province has been plagued by frequent disasters in recent years, the rural economy has been exhausted, and the people's plight is already unspeakable. Who knew that since the spring of last year, the weather has been unfavorable, with excessive rain and droughts, followed by insect infestations and hail, resulting in complete crop failure. The land has become barren, and people are constantly fleeing. The disaster area covers 93 counties, accounting for nine-tenths of the entire province, with over 9 million disaster victims. The most severely affected areas are the 30-odd counties in southern Henan, such as Huangchuan. The extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster are rare.

Roads Filled with Refugees

Although the central government and various charitable organizations have successively allocated and raised emergency relief funds of over 1 million yuan, and the provincial government has issued funds to carry out price stabilization and loans of grain, due to the severity of the disaster and the large number of disaster victims, it is like a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. Therefore, most of the young and strong disaster victims have fled to Hubei, Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, while the elderly and weak have no way to find food and have become starving corpses. The situation is truly unbearable to witness. Recently, a telegram was received from the provincial government stating that thousands upon thousands of disaster victims have been flocking to the provincial capital to beg for relief.

Raising Funds in Shanghai

This time, I accompanied Chairman Shang (Zhen) to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, where I specifically requested relief from the central government. The central government has already sent Zhu Qinglan, the chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, to investigate. This time, I came to Shanghai and visited Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Wang Yiting, and Mr. Qu Wenliu to discuss raising disaster relief funds. I have also received the support of these gentlemen to solicit donations from all sectors. However, for the sake of active relief, I plan to implement well-digging, canal-dredging, and road-repair work relief. Therefore, I plan to visit Mr. Song Ziwen in the coming days to discuss everything. I also hope that compatriots across the country will generously donate and provide relief to save the lives of the 9 million disaster victims in Henan Province.

### Huang Xuchu Returns South Yesterday

Yu Junxian Travels on the Same Ship

Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, came to Shanghai after the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to handle private matters. On the evening of the 3rd, Chen Guangfu, General Manager of Shanghai Bank, and Zou Bingwen, Manager, hosted a banquet for Huang at the International Hotel, and invited many leaders from all sectors of the city to accompany him. During the banquet, they exchanged views on developing Guangxi's industries and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Huang went to the Xinguang Wharf at 4 p.m. yesterday (the 4th) and boarded the Yikang, a small steamer owned by the China Alcohol Company, to board the American postal ship President Wilson to return south. The ship set sail at 5 p.m. People from Shanghai's industrial circles and related parties, such as Yu Qiaqing, Zou Bingwen, Huang Huabiao, and Shi Yucun, went to the wharf to see him off. According to Huang, Liu Weizhang will take the President McKinley to Hong Kong and return to Guangxi on the 5th. In addition, Yu Junxian, a member of the Central Committee, returned south on the same ship yesterday.

### Yu Hanmou, Chen Ce, etc. Change Return to Guangdong to Tonight Again

Because the President McKinley's Arrival in Shanghai Was Delayed

Yu Hanmou, Director of the Pacification Headquarters in Guangdong, Chen Ce, Commander of the Humen Fortress, and Liu Weizhi, Director of the Guangdong Construction Department, etc., were waiting to board the President McKinley of the Da Lai Company to return to Guangdong. It was originally scheduled to board the ship last night and depart from Shanghai this morning. However, the ship encountered fog en route and was repeatedly delayed. It will not be able to sail to Shanghai until this morning. It will sail to Hong Kong at 5:45 p.m. today. Therefore, Yu and others must also postpone their departure until this afternoon. At that time, Mayor Wu and others will go to the ship to see them off.

### Flour Mills Fear Raw Material Shortage

Inventory Less Than 50,000 Bags; Orders for Foreign Wheat May Be Reduced

According to Da Gong News Agency, last spring's wheat production in our country increased by about 30% compared to previous years, resulting in a temporary drop in wheat prices when new wheat was harvested. Taking advantage of the low prices, Japanese merchants bought large quantities in China. As domestic wheat inventories decreased, the flour and wheat market experienced unprecedented price increases in September and October last year. At that time, due to domestic stockpiling, there was a lack of precise statistics on the actual surplus or deficit. Since the spring of this year, the stockpiled goods in the interior have gradually been purchased by flour mills, and the inventory has become meager. Just in this city, the current stock of goods stored in various factories and grain stores is less than 50,000 bags, which is not enough for two months of use, according to the raw material needs of the factories' flour milling.

Ordering Foreign Wheat

Due to the relationship between gluten, the flour milled by various factories is mixed with domestic wheat and foreign wheat. Domestic wheat has soft fibers, so the yield is higher. Currently, various factories have limited domestic wheat stocks and are finding it difficult to purchase more. All the goods ordered at the end of last fall have been shipped to China in batches by the end of the year. This spring, the raw material shortage is even more acute. Another 18,000 tons of foreign wheat has been ordered. The first batch of 8,000 tons has been shipped to Shanghai, and the rest are being shipped in succession and will arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of this month. However, the market price of this foreign wheat is 30 to 40 cents higher per 100 catties (Sima catty) than domestic wheat. Due to the urgent need for raw materials, the remaining losses should also be taken into account.

Factories Reduce Production

Amidst the raw material shortage, flour mills are reducing production to maintain business operations. It is estimated that the number of operating machines is only 60% to 70%. If the situation continues until April and May, when the new wheat has not yet been harvested, it will inevitably lead to a complete shutdown. The wheat sown this year has been severely affected by unfavorable weather. According to speculation from people familiar with agricultural affairs, the domestic wheat production this year is likely to be reduced.

### Last Year's Tea Exports Increased

Totaling Approximately 300,000 Quintals, An Increase of Over 6,000 Quintals Compared to Last Year

### City Police Bureau Thoroughly Disinfects and Implements Random Checks on Reformed Opium Addicts

Designating Two Thousand People, Ordering All Bureaus and Offices to Summon for Inspection; Changing Fourth-Term Licenses Starting April 1st

According to Da Gong News Agency, in order to prevent reformed opium addicts from relapsing and to thoroughly eliminate opium addiction, the City Police Bureau is processing the summons and inspection of reformed opium addicts. According to Dai Lizhen, the head of the Opium Suppression Section, the details are as follows:

Issuing Orders to Summon Reformed Opium Addicts for Inspection

The bureau has registered opium addicts and reported the number of registered opium addicts, totaling over 42,000 people, of which over 18,000 have voluntarily quit. However, last year, various sub-bureaus discovered over 220 opium addicts who had relapsed after quitting. After interrogation by the bureau's Third Section, they were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for imprisonment. In order to prevent opium addicts from being indecisive and relapsing, the bureau, with the approval of the municipal government, ordered the 16th Pu West Gate Sub-Bureaus to summon reformed opium addicts for inspection last month. In order to thoroughly eliminate opium addiction, 2,000 reformed opium addicts were designated a few days ago, and the list was announced to all police sub-bureaus and police stations, ordering them to summon them for inspection. After the 2,000 opium addicts have been summoned for inspection, they will be summoned in batches to ensure that reformed opium addicts do not relapse and fall into the legal net.

This Year's Seized Opium Cases

Since the end of the opium addict registration at the end of last December, the bureau has issued orders to all bureaus and offices to step up the investigation and arrest of unregistered opium addicts and drug dealers. As of yesterday, 48 drug cases have been seized, and 84 opium addicts have been arrested. After interrogation by the bureau's Third Section, they were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for trial under military law. The drug dealers will be interrogated by the headquarters and then requested for approval from the Military Affairs Commission for immediate execution by shooting, in order to deter others.

Opium Addicts' Licenses to Be Renewed Next Month

According to the regulations, opium addicts' licenses in this city are renewed every six months. The third-term licenses expired on October 1st of last year and will expire on the 30th of this month. The Opium Suppression Section of the bureau is actively processing the fourth-term licenses, which will begin to be renewed on April 1st. At that time, a full registration will be announced first, and opium addicts will go to renew their licenses.

### Shanghai Electric Power Company's Profits Last Year

12,454,575 Yuan

According to the 1936 annual report released by the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the company made every effort to increase all types of business last year. Although the business situation in the first half of the year was not good, there were still many new subscribers. As a result of this effort, despite the continued sluggishness of most construction activities throughout the year, the number of users still increased by 2,229. At the end of last year, there were a total of 78,934 users. The kilowatt units sold increased by 5% compared to 1935, so the annual settlement showed a very good business performance. The expenses required for the company's expansion and improvement can all be paid from the profits without the need to raise new funds. The reserve fund listed on the balance sheet totals 9,438,878 yuan, an increase of 1,590,291 yuan compared to the end of 1935. The company's income, as of the end of last year, after deducting expenses and other items, showed a profit of 12,454,575 yuan. The company's assets are valued at 177,830,215 yuan.

### Capital of Various Industries Allowed to Submit Supplementary Income Tax Declarations

City Chamber of Commerce Invites Representatives of Various Industries to Talk Today

According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Finance is implementing income tax, and with the assistance of the City Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Industries Association, the promotion is proceeding smoothly. The capital declarations for business income tax were closed at the end of last month. The Shanghai office is currently reviewing them and will report them to the head office in the coming days. However, there are still some businesses and companies that do not understand the filing procedures and meaning and have not filed. The City Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene representatives of various industry associations throughout the city this afternoon to discuss. At that time, Liang Hejun, director of the Shanghai office, and others will attend to explain in detail. It is reported that in order to facilitate merchants, supplementary declarations are allowed. According to the staff of the office, income tax is a good tax, and the procedures must be changed from the previous malpractices. A more generous attitude should be adopted to achieve the initial intention of not harassing merchants. It is hoped that merchants can trust the government to facilitate the promotion. It is also reported that charitable organizations or the foundations and educational savings of groups that are stipulated to be tax-exempt are now also starting to be declared, with the deadline at the end of this month. However, in order to prevent abuses, more detailed regulations will be added. The former must be legal charitable organizations or groups designated as funds for certain purposes and not used at any time. The latter must be savings for children's education, and receipts from school fee payments must be used as proof when receiving the principal and interest. Otherwise, the interest income will be taxed at the ordinary deposit interest rate. In addition, the office will earnestly handle the tax refunds for overpaid taxes. After calculating the tax payment lists from all parties, about twenty cases have been discovered, most of which are due to miscalculations by the taxpaying institutions. Although the amounts are very scattered, they have all been reviewed, listed, and registered. Once the tax refund method is agreed upon, the taxpaying institutions will be notified to collect the refunds. The procedures will also be simplified.

### Workers at British Tram Company's Machine Room Went on Strike Yesterday

Seven Demands Rejected by Management; Representatives to Petition Party and Government Agencies This Morning

According to Da Gong News Agency, Zhang Shunbao and Zhang Shiqing, two steelworkers at the Herd Road Old Factory of the British Shanghai Tram Company in the Public Concession, had requested three days of leave from the company, but they had not returned to work after the expiration of the leave. They returned to the factory on the 27th of last month. The company fired them on the grounds that the workers had not applied for an extension of their leave after the leave expired. The factory workers expressed dissatisfaction upon hearing the news and negotiated with the company, but to no avail. Therefore, a go-slow occurred on the evening of the 27th. The company sent people to persuade them and promised to reply on the afternoon of the 3rd. By the day before yesterday, the company still had not given a definite reply. At about 10 p.m., all 80-odd workers expressed dissatisfaction and went on strike. All 80-odd workers at the Huishan Road factory also followed suit, and the situation was quite serious.

Joint Strike

Since the 160-odd workers in the machine room and coppersmith room of the old and new factories in Herd Road and Huishan Road went on strike, at about 7 a.m. yesterday, the workers in Huishan Road flocked to the main factory on Baikai'er Road, demanding that all workers join the strike. Upon hearing the news, the Western manager of the factory persuaded the workers and promised to reply at 4 p.m. However, the factory still did not reply at that time, so all the workers poured out of the factory and joined the strike. Currently, the striking workers include 86 from the Herd Road factory, 86 from the Huishan Road factory, and over 300 workers from various rooms at the Baikai'er Road factory, totaling about 500 people.

Obstructing Tram Operation

After the workers in the two factories in the eastern district of Shanghai joined the strike, the Yulin Road police station in charge dispatched over 100 Chinese and Western detectives and several police cars to guard the area. At about 4 p.m., when a tram on the 8th route on Yangshupu Road was running, more than 30 workers went to stop it. Two workers were arrested by the detectives. Then, at the Pingliang Road intersection, many workers went to question the detectives upon hearing the news. The detectives, fearing an accident, released the workers immediately. There have been no other disturbances, but the police station is on high alert.

Presenting Conditions

After the workers of the three factories went on strike, they presented seven conditions, as follows: (1) The two workers who were unreasonably dismissed should be reinstated immediately. (2) For every year of service, a month's severance pay should be given, and so on. For those who have not completed one year, it should be calculated at 12%. (3) Whether the factory closes down or the workers resign, all severance pay should be paid. (4) If a worker dies or is injured on the job and cannot work, in addition to the severance pay he is entitled to, special condolence money should be given. (5) Severance pay should be given for five years of service, regardless of whether the worker resigns or retires. (6) If a worker takes sick leave with a doctor's certificate, his salary should be paid. (7) Work should be stopped on Sundays, and salaries should be paid.

Negotiations Failed

At 4 p.m., the workers of the three factories sent foremen Ge Wenpei, Shu Changlin, Chen Pinhai, Zhu Xiaogen, Xu Renhai, Tian Axiang, Zhou Shenglin, and Lu Sanbao to the general office on North Suzhou River to meet with Park Locke, the tram manager, to negotiate, but they were rejected, resulting in no outcome. The foremen held a meeting last night to discuss how to deal with the situation.

Petition This Morning

The workers decided at the meeting last night to send 12 representatives to the City Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the General Labor Union, and other agencies this morning to petition for assistance and mediation in order to prevent the labor unrest from escalating.

Not Escalating

A Da Gong News Agency reporter inquired about the opinions of representatives of the ticket sellers and drivers on this labor unrest yesterday. According to them, the labor unrest of the ticket sellers and drivers had been resolved by the party and government agencies, but they hoped that the company would implement the agreed-upon measures uniformly and not make excuses to obstruct them. They also said that ticket seller No. 243, due to his weak health, was unable to work and had requested the company to retire and issue severance pay. Who knew that the company authorities replied that the severance pay would be implemented from February 1, 1937, and that the previous years of work could not be included. Therefore, the workers are very panicked and have requested the party and government agencies to negotiate. As for the labor unrest of the three factories, it is hoped that the company will accept their demands so that the labor unrest can be resolved as soon as possible.

### Yangtze River Route to Return to Normal Starting Today

Customs lifts ban on waterways, six companies cancel shallow water fees

Last year in September and October, the river water had already receded. When the water level was at its lowest, the Jiujiang-Hankou section receded to nine feet and one inch. Large ships from the six Shanghai companies could only reach Wuhu, and medium-sized ships could only reach Jiujiang. Freight transportation between Xun and Han was changed to barge transshipment. Above Yuezhou on the Hankou-Changsha line, the water level even dropped to one foot, and navigation was completely suspended. All cargo was transported by local boats. The Sichuan River route was also divided into three linked sections, causing major difficulties for Yangtze River shipping. The Jianghan Customs temporarily closed the original river channel and sought a new route to maintain transportation for five months. Until recently, due to the warm weather, the water level in the Yangtze River has risen sharply.

Water Level Rises Significantly

Yesterday, various shipping companies in this port received a telegram from Hankou stating that the shallowest point in the upper reaches has risen to more than eighteen feet, and all difficult navigation points between Jiujiang and Hankou are unobstructed. Large ships can pass directly to Hankou with heavy loads. Ships carrying rice, salt, iron, coal, and deep-draft seagoing vessels can also travel up and down without hindrance. Terry, the Superintendent of the Jianghan Customs Inspection Department, sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday stating that the sections of the waterway closed during the shallow water period will be reopened for navigation on the 5th of this month (i.e., today). The shallowest waterways,

Is Daijia Island

And Luohu Island. When the water was shallow last winter, the Jianghan Customs closed these two waterways, restricting the passage of Yangtze River ships traveling up and down, and set up red and black flag buoys there as warning signs for ships. The lightship in the eastern channel of Daijia Island was stopped from emitting light, and the lightship below Luohu Island also turned off its lights to indicate that this route was impassable. To prevent accidents, the Fankou small steamer was specially dispatched to serve as a guard in that section. Now that the river water has risen sharply, the

Navigation Route Restored

For traffic will be implemented from today. The red and black flag buoys on Daijia Island will be removed, and the lightship in the eastern channel of that area and the Luohu Island lightship will resume emitting light as usual from today, indicating that ships can resume navigation. The Fanjiang small steamer will also be withdrawn from today. All changes to the Yangtze River route during the shallow water period will be restored to their original state today. Lest the shipping companies be unaware, this is telegraphed in detail for notification to avoid misunderstandings. The six companies in this port

Further Agreed

In view of the fact that the Yangtze River water has risen greatly and there are no restrictions on the movement of ships and the loading of goods, the shallow water freight increase agreed upon last year during the shallow water period will be cancelled uniformly from the 10th of this month. The Yangtze River section will be reduced by 50 percent, and the Changsha route will be reduced by 100 percent. It was previously discussed to shorten the reduction when the water rose. Now that it has been discussed and decided, the shallow water fee added last year will be cancelled uniformly from the 10th of this month, restoring the original rate from five months ago. However, due to the sharp increase in various expenses on the ship, after the shallow water fee is cancelled, the freight rate will be moderately increased by 20 percent as compensation. An announcement will be made to all passengers soon.

### Notice from the Tenant Association

Refusing to pay house tax for road construction beyond the concession

According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Tenant Association of this city believes that the forced collection of house tax by the Public Works Department in the road construction area beyond the concession concerns the infringement of Chinese sovereignty. In addition to requesting the municipal government to negotiate the recovery of self-management, it specially notified tenants in the area yesterday to refuse to pay the tax unanimously. The road construction beyond the concession is an illegal act by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession that infringes upon Chinese sovereignty. The various sectors have long advocated for recovery. However, the Bureau is determined to persist, and although negotiations have been held repeatedly, no thorough solution has been obtained. Now the Public Works Department is intensifying its efforts and is willing to use various coercive methods to force the collection of house tax, which is extremely indignant. The owners have now expressed their opposition, and all of our tenants should also deeply recognize that the road construction area beyond the concession should legally be managed by the municipal government. If we rashly pay the tax, it is tantamount to making a cocoon and helping to create the infringement fact. The Association cannot bear to sit idly by. In addition to submitting a request to the municipal government to quickly negotiate recovery for self-management, a special notice is hereby issued to all tenants that they must take consistent steps and persist to the end, and emphasize national integrity to maintain sovereignty. This notice is hereby issued.

### Mint Purchases Eight Nickel-Copper Coin Machines from the US

Increasing the production of new subsidiary coins, expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month

According to Shenshi News Agency, since the implementation of the legal tender policy in our country two years ago, in order to unify the currency system, the Ministry of Finance's Central Mint was ordered to mint one-cent and half-cent copper coins, as well as five-cent, one-dime, and two-dime nickel-based new subsidiary coins, which began to circulate in the market in February last year. Now, due to the convenience of use, the demand from all over the country is increasing day by day, resulting in a situation where the daily output of new coins is insufficient for distribution. Therefore, there is a recent plan to add machinery to increase the daily output of nickel coins to one million pieces to meet demand. Eight coin minting machines were specially purchased from the United States, with four machines dedicated to minting one-cent and half-cent copper coins, and four machines dedicated to minting one-dime and two-dime nickel coins. The machinery has been purchased by the Central Mint from the United States and will soon be shipped from the United States to China. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month and will be installed and completed in May to start minting. The factory authorities believe that after the new machines are added, the factory premises will be insufficient, so a new factory building has been located to the left of the original factory site, costing approximately 20,000 yuan, and construction has begun. It will soon be completed to house the newly purchased coin minting machinery. After the new machines arrive, the factory will have a total of 25 machines. Based on the total production rate of the existing 17 machines, it can produce 18,750,000 to 18,800,000 one-cent and half-cent copper coins, and 20 to 25 percent nickel coins per day.

We hope to inform various manufacturers to pay attention and take the opportunity to promote Nanyang trade in order to achieve first-mover advantage.

### A Woman Crushed into Multiple Pieces on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Tracks

Resembling Suicide, Body Separated into More Than Ten Sections, The Flesh Was Gruesome and Unbearable to Witness

Around 10 p.m. the night before last, a patrol team from the Zhabei Security Corps discovered a human head on the railway tracks between Gonghe Xin Road and Datong Road. Upon inspection, it was determined to be that of a female, with her hair cut off. Further inspection revealed multiple sections of the body, including the torso, legs, and feet, scattered along the second track (belonging to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway) for more than ten zhang (approximately 33 meters). The patrol team immediately reported the discovery to the railway police, who in turn notified the section chief of the railway. Upon arrival and investigation, it was determined that the victim had been struck and killed by a high-speed train at 10:15 p.m. The railway police then summoned the local bailiff, Shen Xiaowu, to collect the severed limbs, head, and torso and place them together to prevent further damage by passing trains. Yesterday morning, the bailiff reported the incident to the Shanghai Local Court. Around 4 p.m., Prosecutor Li Fen, accompanied by a female coroner, arrived at the scene for an inquest. The victim's skull was crushed, and the brain matter had flowed out. Both hands and fingers were also crushed. The abdomen and intestines were exposed. One foot was severed from the knee. She was barefoot, with a pair of leather shoes lying separately. A pair of yellow-black striped socks were also separated from her feet. She was wearing a tobacco-colored silk spring cat-skin cheongsam, with a single blue Shilin cloth long coat and a striped cloth short shirt underneath, and black trousers. She appeared to be around thirty years old. During the inquest, a green gemstone ring was still on the victim's finger, which the prosecutor took for safekeeping. Judging by the circumstances, it appeared to be a suicide. The body was separated into about ten sections, and the flesh was gruesome and unbearable to witness. Since no family members could be found, the prosecutor filled out the coroner's report and instructed the bailiff to prepare a coffin for burial.

### Zhang Youli Assaults His Mother After Failed Attempt to Violate a Neighbor

His Desire to Achieve His Goal Resembles That of a Beast, He Assaults His Mother for Scolding Him; The Police Station Requests Severe Punishment

Zhang Youli, a 35-year-old Jiangbei native who resides at No. 16, Shuncheng Lane, Zhoujia Pai Road, selling steamed buns, is still single. Sun Xiuying, a 17-year-old girl from Taizhou, lives in the same two-story building. She is somewhat attractive and works at the Yufeng Textile Factory. Zhang Youli often teases her, but she ignores him. On the morning of the 22nd of last month, at around 10 a.m., because she was working the night shift, she was asleep in bed. Zhang Youli took advantage of the fact that her mother, Mrs. Ding, had gone out to the vegetable market to buy vegetables. He secretly climbed up to the second floor, pinned down Sun Xiuying, and attempted to violate her. At that moment, his mother returned from the vegetable market, and the girl told her the truth. His mother scolded him, but he became angry and started yelling loudly. He then violently pushed his mother and the girl to the ground and prevented Sun Xiuying from going to work at the factory. He used a knife to cut the girl's face, causing injuries. Chinese detective Zhang Yunjian heard the commotion and arrived, arrested Zhang Youli, and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Bianfen continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 3.

He even assaulted his mother for scolding him. He requested severe punishment. When questioned, the defendant's confession was evasive. Judge Xiao ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled the sentencing for a later date.

The Yu family, a landlord residing at No. 32, Shangxian Lane, Lane 358, Xiafei Road in the French Concession, moved out after being sued by the landlord for owing rent. On the 17th of last month, Yang Wu, a 27-year-old woman from Nanjing who was renting a room downstairs, dismantled the loft boards installed by the landlord for sale while moving. Cao A'er, a city resident who swept the streets in the lane, stopped her from dismantling. Cao's wife, Zhou, rushed over to help, leading to a dispute and mutual struggle at the police station. As a result, Yang Wu was still allowed to dismantle the boards. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 3 p.m., Yang Wu went to Cao to ask for the key to open the door and take the iron bed. Cao's wife, Cao Zhou, again had a verbal dispute with Yang Wu. Wu reported it to the police, who summoned Zhou for questioning. Because Zhou was being unreasonable, they decided to detain her. At 9 p.m., she was released and returned home. Zhou immediately felt pain in her chest. Cao A'er sent her to Jianan Hospital at No. 17, Laozhen Father Road for treatment. Zhou was already in her last breath and eventually died due to ineffective treatment in half an hour. The hospital reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The deceased's husband, Cao A'er, claimed that his wife had been beaten by Yang Wu on the 27th of last month and verbally abused on this day, which led to her detention and death. The police then transported the body to the Tongren Auxiliary Hall Mortuary. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the First Special Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the mortuary at noon to examine the body. No injuries were found on the body. Then, in the afternoon, the body was dissected for a detailed examination. The results showed that the deceased had a history of asthma and heart failure and died from stress. After the examination, the official allowed the husband of the deceased to sign an affidavit to claim the body for burial. However, the deceased's husband was unwilling to accept this and hired a lawyer to prepare for a legal resolution with Yang Wu.

After Chen passed away due to illness, Wang took over the position. However, Chen's son, Chen Defu (currently 23 years old), would frequently demand money from Wang. Wang would often provide assistance, giving him one yuan or several jiao each time. On the 28th of last month, Wang Aru suddenly received a threatening letter from Chen Defu, intending to extort

Fifty yuan

Wang ignored it. Then, on the 1st of this month, he received another letter stating that if he did not pay, he would be met with knives and axes. Wang reported this to the General Patrol Room. Wang would go to the Fuzhou Road vegetable market around 8 a.m. every day to buy vegetables. On the 2nd of the month, his son, Wang Hanzhang, went to buy the vegetables instead. Chen Defu was already waiting inside the vegetable market. When he saw Wang Hanzhang, he stepped forward, first threatening him verbally and then taking out

The detectives then, together with personnel from the Municipal Police Department, arrested Wang Shaoan at No. 224 Xinjiang Road and temporarily detained him at the Municipal Police Department. They then went to Zhou Runxing's shop and retrieved the ax and hammer. Yesterday morning, Chen Defu was transferred to Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Court. The Patrol Room lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the circumstances and filed a lawsuit for the crime of extortion. He stated that Wang Shaoan had not yet been brought to the police station, so he requested

Adjournment for Hearing

Wang Aru then testified about the events, stating that he had provided the defendant with about two hundred yuan in assistance before. When questioned, Chen Defu confessed that the plaintiff was originally a partner of his father. After his father passed away, he had taken over the job for half a month, but then the plaintiff took it away. Although he had given him a considerable amount of money, it was all paid separately. The threatening letter was written by him, and so on. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal court, reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for another week of interrogation.

### Hengli River Works: County Government Urges Completion of Dredging

District Office Summons Baojia for Discussion

The Shanghai County's requisition of labor to dredge the Hengli River works, including the construction of dams to pump water and engage in manual dredging, has been hampered by continuous rain, leading to slow progress. The Shanghai County Government issued Instruction No. 2265 yesterday, stating that the Hengli River channel in the county is of utmost importance for water conservancy and transportation within the county. Local individuals reported that the river had been neglected for years, resulting in increasing siltation. With the approval of this office and endorsement, funds were allocated from the provincial relief fund surplus and funds were raised to implement dredging this year. However, it has been found that more than two months have passed since the commencement of work, and the amount of excavated soil is minimal. The spring plowing season is approaching quickly, and the completion of the project is uncertain, which is a matter of grave concern. All villagers along the river must understand that the dredging of the Hengli River is primarily for irrigation of fields and convenience of transportation. Although no wages are paid for soil excavation, the construction of dams, water pumping, and equipment management involve public funds, which are substantial. It is imperative to take advantage of the current agricultural off-season to work together diligently to complete the project, and no one should use excuses to delay or postpone the work. In the future, before the river is dredged to the specified width and depth, no dams may be opened to divert water, and the work funds received by each district office will not be reimbursed. In addition to issuing separate orders to the respective district chiefs to supervise the work strictly, this announcement is hereby issued, urging all conscripted laborers along the river to consider the vital interests of the river and make a concerted effort. Both agricultural and water conservancy matters depend on it. This announcement is made. It is learned that the Third District Office convened meetings at Huangwu in Zhuanqiao at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday and in the District Office Conference Room at 3:00 PM yesterday, respectively. The meetings were attended by township chiefs, bao chiefs, jia chiefs, section chiefs, and dam contractors concerned. Attendees included Wang Zhixue, Ru Bocai, Zhao Zhongfang, Lu Dezhong, Zhuang Jinshan, Zhao Xinglin, Sun Shiben, Zhou Yangju, Lu Yingquan, Lu Ruming, Lin Quangen, Ni Binzhi, Zhu Hutang, Zhang Cailin, and over two hundred others. During the meeting, District Chief Zhang reported on the actual situation of the river works and the progress plan. Then, questions were raised for joint discussion, leading to the following resolutions: (1) Dam workers must diligently guard the dams; (2) Accumulated water must be pumped out by the ninth of this month; (3) Collective dredging will resume on the seventh of this month; (4) The District Office will provide additional water pumps to assist with water pumping; (5) Soil deposits on both banks will be removed immediately. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.

### Navigation Administration Bureau Cracks Down on Overloaded Ships

Except for lightweight and scattered luggage, no cargo is allowed to be loaded on the canopies of the ships to avoid the risk of being top-heavy. Navigation must be handled with utmost care to ensure safety. After this order is issued, anyone who dares to deliberately violate it will be severely punished upon being reported or found to be true after investigation.

Posing as if they were treating guests, they displayed pistols and knives to threaten the occupants, driving everyone into one room. Tan had already gone to the shipyard to work, and his wife was out shopping. Only Tan's mother and a maid were at home, and they were all tied up with ropes and gagged with cotton cloth, leaving them to ransack the house at will. As a result, they stole 96 silver dollars, over 20 legal tender, a gold chain, a pair of gold buttons, a platinum watch, a Western-style overcoat, and a gray serge robe.

### Debt Collection Leads to Bloody Incident

Unexpectedly, Xu Housheng forgot and led the debt collector upstairs. Di became enraged and spoke disrespectfully, and Xu also refused to yield, leading to a fight. Each grabbed wooden stools and crockery to strike the other, resulting in Di suffering several punctures to his face and legs, with blood flowing profusely and serious injuries. However, Xu Housheng's face was also struck several times, resulting in less severe injuries. Neighbors called the police, and Ma Shuquan arrived and took both injured men to the Lao Beimen Police Station. Chief Shen immediately sent the injured men to Nanyang Hospital for treatment.

### Buck to Perform Benefit Show

Location Still Carlton, Date Still Under Discussion

The "Buck Battles All-Stars" show has been extremely popular since its performance at the Carlton. This is due to the theater's exceptional artistry. All of the group's performances are extremely beautiful and moving. The quality of the dance is unmatched by ordinary dancers in Shanghai. Even the "Ten Thousand Flowers" troupe that came to China a few years ago was not as good. Furthermore, Buck's martial arts are even more exceptional. The "pulling a car" performance is done entirely with muscle. Even the "Ten Thousand Flowers" troupe did not have this kind of performance. It is said that to repay the kindness of the people of Shanghai, in addition to reducing ticket prices and changing the program every day, the troupe will also perform a benefit show for a certain organization. The location will still be the Carlton, but the date is still under discussion. Everything is in progress. The program for the benefit show will be even more exciting.

This toothpaste is made under the supervision of pharmacists, so it has special medicinal effects. It is also made of pure and fine materials, so there is no sound when brushing, so it does not damage the enamel. It is the only fine product among domestic toothpastes. It is sold in all major pharmacies and department stores.

### Post Office Notice: Add Red Label to Express Letters

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1398 states that domestic express mail should have two horizontal lines drawn at the top and bottom of the envelope, and the words "express" should be written between the two horizontal lines at the top. This is already stipulated in Article 261 of the Postal Regulations. However, most senders have not followed this method, which makes it difficult for the post office to sort express mail. In order to make it easier to identify, a deep red label has been printed as a trial, similar to the method for airmail, and is intended to be attached to the envelope when sending express mail. This label can be obtained by the sender from various post offices. This notice is hereby issued to inform the public. Director Zha Peilin, March 3.

The Wing On steamer remains the property of our bureau and is not subject to any restrictions. We request that your newspaper make a correction. Sincerely, Chao Jimei, March 3.

### Tianjin-Shanghai Football Match Scheduled for the 26th at Yiyuan

Tianjin Team to Depart Tianjin on the 22nd

Three Major Battles Scheduled in Shanghai

The Tianjin-Shanghai football match is scheduled to be held on Easter Sunday, the 26th of this month, in Shanghai. The Tianjin team is scheduled to depart Tianjin on the 22nd and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 24th. Three matches will be played in Shanghai before the team returns north on the 29th. The Shanghai Football Club has prepared everything to welcome the Tianjin team. The match schedule is as follows:

Match Schedule

March 26th (Friday): Tianjin vs. Shanghai, Inter-port Match, Yiyuan

March 27th (Saturday): Tianjin vs. China, Friendship Match, Shenyuan

March 29th (Monday): Tianjin vs. Army Union, Friendship Match, Yiyuan

If it rains on the 26th or the game ends in a tie, the match schedule may be changed.

No More Trial Matches

Regarding the selection of the Shanghai team, it is reported that the Shanghai Football Club, in order to save time, will no longer hold trial matches. The selection will be based on the team that went to Hong Kong, with slight changes. It has been decided that Laville players will not participate in the inter-port team and will represent the Army Union instead.

Three Matches Analysis

The Tianjin-Shanghai inter-port match has been played five times. Tianjin has won three times, Shanghai has won once, and there has been one tie. The tie occurred in 1934 when the match was held in Shanghai, with each team scoring three goals. As the Hong Kong team was in Shanghai at the time, a triangular match was held. In this three-match series, the Shanghai team, returning victorious from Hong Kong, will face a fierce battle against the Tianjin team. Although the China team did not perform well during its southern tour, with Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Jia Youliang, and others all playing in Shanghai, the situation will be greatly changed. Tianjin should also not be optimistic against Laville. Laville recently defeated the Pinghan Railway team 6-1, while Pinghan tied the Beining team 3-3. In addition, Laville's momentum has been great in Shanghai recently, and there are many good players, so they should not be underestimated.

Tianjin Preliminary Selection

Central News Agency, Tianjin, 4th: The Tianjin-Shanghai football match will soon be held in Shanghai. The Tianjin International Football Club will select 15 outstanding players from various teams to form an army and travel to Shanghai from Tianjin on the 22nd. The second selection match is scheduled for the 7th to determine the official representatives.

### Gentry in Zhenjiang Establish a Large-Scale Middle School

The location is planned to be outside the East Gate

In the past, Zhenjiang had few private middle schools other than church schools. It was not until ten years ago that the current Women's Vocational Middle School was established. The need for a boys' middle school is particularly urgent. Although Zhenjiang Private Middle School and Dong Middle Vocational School have been established one after another in recent years, there are still many applicants. However, the law is widely adopted, and thousands of out-of-school youths are added every year in Zhenjiang alone. Now it is reported that the gentry Lu Xiaobo, Yan Huiyu, and Leng Yuqiu believe that this is a great loss to the local area and have decided to establish a larger private middle school to remedy it. A few days ago, they reached an agreement with Hu Bijang, Xu Jingren, Tang Shoumin, and other giant merchants in Shanghai to actively carry out the work. The fund has been designated for various public welfare donations, totaling more than 100,000 yuan. The school site is planned to be more than 100 mu of reclaimed land in the suburbs of the East Gate. The construction of a new school building has invited Zhang Haicheng, the former president of Nanjing Middle School, to plan everything, with the goal of enrolling students in the autumn of this year.

### High School Graduation Examination Problems

— Ying

The high school graduation examination method was started in the summer of the 21st year and has been six years now. It has been revised four times, and possible malpractices have been minimized. The voices of opposition have gradually disappeared, but the remaining sound is still endless, just because a system cannot be beneficial without harm, and the remaining abuses of the examination have not yet been completely eradicated. In a blink of an eye, the summer vacation is coming, and provinces and cities will be busy with examination administration. Those who care about education will again have something to discuss. In order to avoid arguments that violate the facts and judgments that fall into errors, we should first review the previous revisions of the examination methods and their implementation. The high school graduation examination method began with the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations on Graduation Examinations for Primary and Secondary School Students in May of the 21st year. In December of the 22nd year, the primary school examination was abolished, and the Regulations on Graduation Examinations for Secondary School Students were promulgated. In April of the 24th year, the Revised Regulations on Graduation Examinations for Secondary School Students were promulgated. In April of the 25th year, an order was issued to change the high school graduation examination method. In November, it was also ordered that the winter examination would still use the previous change method. In the four promulgated decrees before and after the unification, regarding the subjects of the examination, the provisional regulations stipulated that the junior high school was divided into eight subjects: Party Doctrine, Chinese, Arithmetic, History, Geography, Nature, Physical Education, and Foreign Language. The senior high school was divided into ten subjects: Party Doctrine, Chinese, Arithmetic, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Foreign Language, and Physical Education. The formal regulations stipulated that the junior high school was divided into seven subjects: Civics, Chinese, Arithmetic, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, and Foreign Language. The senior high school was divided into nine subjects: Civics, Chinese, Arithmetic, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, and Foreign Language. The revised regulations followed the same unchanged. The change method stipulated that both junior and senior high schools were divided into five subjects: Chinese, Foreign Language, Arithmetic, Chemistry, and History and Geography. Regarding the calculation of grades, the provisional regulations stipulated that the grades of each subject not examined would be sent by each original school to the主管 education administrative agency for review of the calculation methods, etc. The formal regulations stipulated that the calculation method for the grades of each subject of the graduation examination should be based on the school's graduation grades of each subject (the science year grades account for three-fifths of the graduation grades of each subject, and the graduation examination grades of each subject account for two-fifths) accounting for four-tenths, and the grades of each subject of the examination accounting for six-tenths, combined for calculation. The revised regulations stipulated the same, but the so-called school graduation grades of each subject are the average of the three-year grades. The change method stipulated that the sum of the grades of each subject of the examination and the grades of each subject not examined, divided by the sum of the number of examination subjects and the number of subjects not examined, is the total average of the graduation grades. Regarding the problem of school graduation examinations before participating in the graduation examination, although the provisional regulations did not have clear regulations, in June of the 22nd year, the Ministry of Education issued a notice that those who did not participate in the graduation examination, failed, and did not participate in the school graduation examination would not be issued a graduation certificate or a study certificate. It is that the school graduation examination must still be held before the graduation examination. The formal regulations stipulated that the grades of each subject of the graduation examination should account for four-tenths of the school graduation grades of each subject, and the so-called school graduation grades of each subject are calculated by each science year grades accounting for three-fifths and the graduation examination grades of each subject accounting for two-fifths. It is clearly stipulated that the school graduation examination should be held before the graduation examination. The revised regulations abolished the school graduation examination (but junior high schools that do not participate in the examination or sample examination still need to hold a school graduation examination). The graduating students should hold a semester examination for the courses studied in the last semester, and the average grade of each academic year should be the school graduation grade. Regarding the calculation of school grades, the provisional regulations stipulated that the total average of the average grades of all students participating in the examination in each school should be used as the grade of each school, and the grades should be graded and revealed. The formal regulations stipulated that the percentage of (1) the number of graduating students in each school to the number of participants in the examination, (2) the number of participants in the examination to the number of passing students, and (3) the average of the grades of the passing students should be listed as 甲, 乙, 丙, 丁, four grades and revealed. The revised regulations canceled the item of the percentage of the number of participants in the examination to the number of passing students. The change method stipulated that only a list of schools participating in the examination should be issued, and there is no need to calculate school grades based on student grades. This is also a large change in the content of the examination law.

### Yarn

This month, yarn prices have risen eight times,

Jumping up by $6.60.

American cotton, grade three, soars relentlessly.

Indian merchants return with a bullish approach to buying.

Short positions are rapidly covered, intensifying the reactive surge.

The yarn market has turned firm, and the price surge is intense, primarily due to the continuous rise of yarn and cotton prices overseas. Osaka's grade three yarn has surged wildly, jumping from $8.50 to $9.40, shocking the market and stimulating active buying. The "gold shops" (金子帮) have returned to purchase and cover short positions. Furthermore, bullish companies have been organized this month, mainly by Indian merchants, drawing in firms like Jinchang, Gengfeng, and Yichang. As a result, the March futures contract has seen increasingly fierce price increases, breaking through the $40 barrier, closing at $241.50, a significant increase of $6.60 compared to the previous day. However, spot yarn transactions have not yet seen substantial growth.

This month, breaking through the $40 barrier again. At the opening of the cotton yarn market, prices continued to soar due to the bullish market conditions for American cotton, grade three. Market sentiment was high, and the previous day's price drop was deemed too severe. Speculators, sensing a change in the environment, rushed to cover short positions, intensifying the reactive surge and fueling the price increase. However, spot sales remained sluggish, keeping the market relatively stable. Nevertheless, this month has shown signs of a wild surge, rising to a closing price of $240. The grade three yarn price soared by $8.80. The prices for all months of standard yarn were up $2.70 to $3.50 compared to the previous day's closing price. However, this month alone rose by $5.10. At the afternoon opening, the momentum for this month changed dramatically. The market widely speculated that Indian merchant bullish companies bought over 10,000 bales in the morning. Consequently, retail short sellers rushed to cover their positions. The "gold shops," which had sold heavily the previous day, returned to cover their short positions yesterday, further tightening the market. Prices broke through the $40 barrier, and distant months entered a favorable position, but buying decreased. After the second session, the current month surged independently, while distant months remained flat. As a result, the current month rose an additional $1.50 compared to the morning closing price, while distant months rose or fell by $0.20-$0.30. Jinchang and Changfeng bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. Investigating the sales: Hengyi sold 3,400 bales, Yuda 3,750 bales, Hexing 3,850 bales, Changji 1,550 bales, Renfeng 5,550 bales, Yicheng 1,350 bales, Runkang 1,650 bales, Xiecheng 2,600 bales, Shengyuan 2,400 bales, Yongda 4,200 bales, and Xincheng 2,100 bales.

Foreign cotton consistently rises.

Cotton reacts violently.

Market short sellers rush to cover their positions.

Distant months break through the $44 barrier.

The cotton market sees a major surge, with bullish sentiment. As American cotton continues to advance, spot prices approach the $0.14 mark. Indian cotton is also high, and Osaka's grade one cotton is up over $2. As a result, market sentiment is stirred, and short sellers rush to cover their positions. At the same time, the yarn market turns bullish, and the price increase becomes even sharper. Futures contracts for both months have risen above the $44 barrier.

Standard cotton rises by $0.75.

At the opening of the standard cotton market, prices for all months rose sharply. Due to the continued rise in American and Indian cotton prices, Osaka's grade one cotton rose from $1 to $1.90 for both near and distant months. As a result, market sentiment was shaken, and retail investors covered their positions. However, most believe that domestic cotton inventories are still high, and they are not interested in taking long positions. As a result, the prices for all months rose by $0.50-$0.60 compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, market conditions were quite strong and were driven by the yarn market. Short covering was particularly urgent. Market discussions favored English cotton. As a result, prices for all months rose an additional $0.05-$0.20 compared to the morning closing price. Investigating the sales: Xincheng sold 3,000 dan, Yuanyi 2,800 dan, Yukang 3,200 dan, Hexing 5,100 dan, Changji 2,200 dan, Changyu 2,000 dan, Dachangcheng 5,000 dan, Hengchang 3,200 dan, Dachang 2,500 dan, Changhe 4,800 dan, Tonghe 2,400 dan, Yongchang 1,300 dan, and Runkang 1,800 dan.

Spot cotton consumption is still good, and mill needs are gradually increasing. Yao cotton is arriving, 1,600 bales.

American cotton price increases intensify.

There are new sellers for distant months as well.

Spot prices approach the $0.04 mark.

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool and unpredictable foreign political situations. Spot cotton was firm, and domestic and foreign traders actively bought, with prices rising by 3 to 13 points. Although large numbers of long positions were closed and cotton farmers hedged, these were absorbed by speculators. Even new cotton for distant months was being purchased by new speculators. The closing of old long positions had already been taken over, so in reality, market conditions became even firmer. At the closing, the public actively bought, and the market continued to rise, with spot prices up 27 points and futures prices up 21-30 points. English cotton spot prices were up 6 points, and futures prices were up 15-16 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to good news from abroad, then weakened due to the closing of long positions, but ultimately, due to a strong stock market, trader purchases, and short covering, prices rose again. Plain Gaw爾 rose by 2.25-2.5 rupees, 奥姆辣 by 2.5-3 rupees, and White羅溪 by 3.25-3.5 rupees. (Telegram from the 3rd)

### Piece Goods

Spring and summer cotton goods sales suddenly surge.

Yesterday, the cloth market was gloomy and rainy. Once it cleared up and the weather turned warm, sales of light-colored spring and summer goods suddenly surged. At the same time, overseas cotton markets continued to rise, and standard yarn and cotton also rebounded rapidly. After the sharp drop in white goods, Dong Pi fine cloth rebounded strongly yesterday. The leading Longtou fine cloth rose by $0.10 in the morning market and later increased to $0.20. Other grades also rose by $0.05-$0.15. Japanese trading houses offered over 200 pieces of Longtou brand fine cloth for April, May, and June delivery in the morning. The opening price for Longtou was $9, and in the afternoon, it was quoted at $9.10. Fine twills from domestic factories and Eastern goods also rebounded by $0.05.

Fine twills from Chinese and foreign factories were taken up by domestic and Yangtze River/Yunnan merchants, totaling nearly 300 bales. Among light-colored goods, striped and plain silk crepe had good momentum, with demand increasing from both northern and southern merchants, domestic merchants, and local retailers, totaling over 500 boxes. Satin, floral cloth, bleached cloth, and Shilin bamboo also sold well, but dark-colored woolens and blue cloth sales gradually turned sluggish.

### Capital Merchants Busily Procure Western-style Woolens

The woolen fabric market saw a great deal of trade yesterday. Sales of Western-style woolens were stronger than those of ordinary Chinese-style fabrics. Customers from the capital (Beijing) mostly came to Shanghai in person to make purchases, and their demand was stronger than in the past. They were actively procuring Western-style materials such as medium-thick serge, Herringbone, Chong Shi Pao Tuike (冲師泡推克), Four Seas Lishi (四·海力斯), Ha Wei (哈味), lotus woolen fabric, floral flannel, and feather yarn. Payment terms were half cash and half credit. Dealers were busy processing sales orders all day. Shipping and postal deliveries for export were also congested. Standard prices were even more favorable than last week.

Yuanfang's auction prices fluctuated.

Yesterday, Thursday, was the 3027th auction of Yuanfang Trading Company, featuring Western satin, yuan velvet, Zhigong woolen fabric, feather silk, yuan silk crepe, foreign red cloth, white cotton yarn, and bleached white cloth, totaling eight categories and 32 brands, with only 33 boxes in total. The market saw scattered purchases from merchants and inland river traders, while local sales were lackluster. The current offerings mainly consisted of single boxes per brand. Dealers showed little competition in purchasing, and auction prices fluctuated. Western satin prices were a few cents lower than the previous auction for three brands. Yuan velvet and Zhigong woolen fabric each rose by one or two cents for one brand. Yuan silk crepe was not listed for a long time, and its price was also average. Twenty-three brands of yuan feather silk were auctioned. Compared to the previous auction, the price of the Zhulin Luanfeng Cai Bashi (竹林鸞鳳彩八士) brand increased from $0.70 to $1, while the Shibazi and Bozi Tu brands increased from $0.75 to $1.40. The Monkey Deer brand rose by $0.60, and the rest rose by one or two cents. Foreign red cloth prices were firm for heavy grades. White cotton yarn and bleached white cloth, being spring season goods, were listed at firm prices. (Announcement) Next Thursday, Renluntu white silk crepe will be added.

### Grains

The wheat market shifts from steady to rising.

Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally stable in the morning, with minimal fluctuations. Due to mixed movements in foreign wheat prices and market buying and selling partially shifting to the flour market, near- and distant-month contracts initially showed slight gains, followed by a slight decline in distant-month contracts due to weather conditions. At the afternoon opening, the market initially appeared stable, but then the flour market rebounded, and the yarn and cotton markets also rebounded sharply, causing prices for all months to gradually rise, increasing by 3 to 5 cents. The spot wheat market was quiet due to limited arrivals and mill demand. Only about 400 bags of Huangqiao wheat were reported to have opened, with prices similar to the previous day.

Flour futures also change in the afternoon.

Yesterday, the flour market showed initial declines followed by gains after the morning opening. Foreign wheat prices were reported as Chicago down $0.10-$0.20, Canada down $0.04 for near-month and $0.10-$0.20 for distant-month contracts, while Liverpool was up 2 pence. After opening prices were quoted, the market was initially stable due to mixed movements in foreign wheat prices. However, as the weather cleared, outside bullish investors actively sold, causing March and April contracts to ease, with the lowest price falling to the $4.00 level, down $0.02-$0.03 from the previous day. July and August contracts saw more active trading and were only down by $0.01. At the afternoon opening, market sentiment suddenly turned bullish due to the rapid rise in yarn and cotton prices and rumors of international borrowing. Short sellers covered their positions, and mills took the opportunity to buy, causing near-month contracts to rebound by about $0.01. July and August contracts also improved by $0.01-$0.02 due to the rebound in near-month contracts. In the future, unless there are special changes overseas, the market is expected to fluctuate.

Soybeans and sesame seeds show different price movements.

Recently, foreign sesame seeds have shown a declining trend due to sluggish sales and lifeless market sentiment. Prices have fallen below the $14.00 level with no one interested, making the overall situation difficult to predict. Spot raw sesame seeds are fortunate to have sporadic purchases from Japanese traders, allowing prices to stabilize. Soybean prices continue to rise by $0.03-$0.04, driven by strong sales of soybean cakes (with 36,000 pieces of cake sold by various factories from Shantou, Xiamen, and inland regions yesterday). Mill demand remains steady, and local demand in this street and inland regions remains strong. Dalian has also rebounded again, making market sentiment appear stable. Yesterday, a total of over 4,000 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans, three truckloads of Sipingjie soybeans, two truckloads of Yingzhou soybeans, and one truckload of Linhuaiguan soybeans were opened, with other soybeans also seeing 600-700 bags traded.

Ke Xian rice sells the most to Guangdong, followed by the local street.

The arrival of Ke Xian rice has slightly decreased recently, but sales to Guangdong remain strong. Rough rice inventories are scarce, making market conditions even more bullish. The machine-milled rice has been actively purchased by Guangdong merchants, and the market has also turned firmer. Rough rice prices continue to rise sharply, and machine-milled rice is also approaching the level. A total of over 17,000 bags were opened, with Guangdong merchants accounting for the most, around 10,000 bags. The local street was next, with Xiamen, Shantou, and North China merchants each purchasing several hundred bags. The main type of rice sold was Gan rice, totaling 14,210 bags, followed by Xiang rice at 3,250 bags, Han rough rice at 330 bags, and Yongyuan at 270 bags.

Rice prices in both the Northern and Southern markets fall again and again.

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 30 firms brought a total of 6,000 shi of goods. Sales in the local market remained sluggish. After boatmen lowered prices, sales increased slightly. Merchants from Xi'an and Qingdao only purchased 700-800 bags of thin-skinned rice, causing market conditions to decline. Thick Japonica rice prices were reduced by $0.15, while thin-skinned rice prices fell by $0.10-$0.18. Dujian depreciated by nearly $0.10, and Yinwu fell by about $0.10.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 70-80 boats from various waterways arrived at the gate. Due to warmer weather, demand for all goods on the market was even more sluggish, and the market showed a trend of prolonged weakness and brief gains. Yesterday, the market price for top-quality white Japonica rice was flat and weak, while the prices for medium- and low-quality rice fell by a few cents to $0.10. Early rice followed, down by $0.07-$0.08, and thin-skinned rice was also down by $0.05-$0.06. Yangbu Jian prices were down nearly $0.10, while Dujian and Ke Jian fell by $0.03-$0.05. Yinbian Yuan prices were down a few cents from the previous market, and the prices of all other goods were weak.

### Securities

Large Accounts Rarely Enter or Exit

Bond prices remain good, up $0.30-$0.40.

Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market tended to be firm. Large accounts rarely entered or exited. However, a certain firm sold about one million in long-term Class A bonds, which was a relatively large amount. Otherwise, only Firm 16 bought, which was relatively more than others, who all made scattered transactions. The trend has become a consolidation, and the market price is not much different from the previous high. If there are flaws, the decline will also be very rapid. The course of yesterday was that the market price was slightly firm at the opening in the morning, and there was some short covering on the table. Although Firm 18 and Firm 57 sold, Firm 16 and retail investors were quite interested in buying. Although the market was consolidating, it was still raised by $0.10-$0.20. In the second session, Firm 38 had a lot of rolling, and Firm 54 sold a lot. Market conditions were mixed, fluctuating around $0.10. In the two sessions in the afternoon, the market was slightly better by $0.05-$0.20 per session because Firm 4 and Firm 16 bought a little. The market became increasingly clear. Only at the close did Firm 54 offer long-term Class A bonds, but the price of Class A bonds was relatively cheap, and there were many buyers, still gaining $0.10. The future of the market price is not likely to see major ups and downs for the time being. As a result, market prices rose uniformly by $0.10-$0.40. The total number of transactions was 4,390,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)

### Silk and Tea

High-Grade Factory Silk Still Needed in America and France

Over the past two days, the overseas silk market has shifted from weak to firm. Both Japan and the US have seen rebounds. Yesterday, Japanese silk in New York was $0.83 and $0.75. Shanghai and Guangdong silk each rose by $0.03 per pound. Exchange sales rose by $0.03 for recent deliveries and $0.02 for futures. Yokohama spot prices rose by 14 yuan, and futures prices rose by 8 yuan, causing sentiment in Shanghai to turn bullish again. It is learned that current factory prices are $810 for white factory 78 uniform RR and $780 for local silk, but there are still few large transactions. American and French dealers are still more active in high-grade factory silk. Domestic silk consumption is also weak, with only scattered trading. The Shanghai silk market has a trend of turning firm with Japan and the US.

Tea Firms Prepare to Open Market

Local tea, such as Ping Shui, has been on hold due to the proposed unified production and sales plan of the United Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. It is now learned that the company's affairs will not be easy to realize this year due to the wide scope. As a result, each tea firm is preparing to open the market as before.

### Preparation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (2)

— Pan Shihao

(3) Business Type: The business type is the business operated by the firm. The business of each firm should be fixed. According to Article 12 of the Implementing Rules, any purchase or sale of goods, securities, or gold and silver currency unrelated to the main business, and whose income is not calculated under the main business income, is considered a temporary profit-making enterprise. According to Article 12 of the Draft Notice on the Collection of Income Tax for First-Category Profit-Making Enterprises, losses other than the main and subsidiary businesses are not considered necessary and reasonable expenses and losses in business. If the taxpayer lists them in the profit and loss statement, they should be removed when calculating net profit. The scope of the business type filled in this form should not be too narrow. When operating a certain type of goods, the manufacturing or sales matters should be clearly stated at the same time. For example, the yarn number of a yarn store selling cotton yarn should be filled in as the sale of cotton yarn. A sugar store that manufactures and sells sugar should be filled in as the manufacture and sale of sugar.

(4) Firm Address: The address should be filled in in detail, such as No. 14 Defeng Lane, Beijing Road, Shanghai. If there are warehouses or factories in other places within the same tax area, it is not necessary to fill them in together and can be filled in separately in the remarks section. There is no need to fill in another return form. However, warehouses and factories that use another name, or whose capital is divided and whose business is completely independent, should be reported on a separate form.

(5) Actual Amount of Business Capital or Share Capital: The Provisional Regulations on Income Tax define capital in Article 3 as the actual amount of capital, and in Article 4 as the capital amount. The Detailed Implementing Rules define capital in Article 5 and Article 6 as capital, and in Article 7 as the capital that refers to the share capital actually paid in by companies organized under the company structure or the principal actually invested by other organizations. Article 46 refers to the actual amount of capital and share capital. The Notice on the Collection of Income Tax for First-Category Profit-Making Enterprises defines capital in Article 2, Article 3, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 19, and Article 20 as capital or capital amount. This form is an applicable return form for non-company organized commercial firms, row stations, factories, and profitable individuals. And this type of profitable business, except for individual operators, should be a partnership organization. Partnerships also have what is called share money. The business capital referred to in this form is in principle the capital of individual operators. The actual amount of share capital is the capital filled in by partnership organizations, and one of them can be selected. (To be continued)

### Dostoevsky's Pushkin Speech

— Chen Hannian

Recently, I have seen many speeches and writings by celebrities and scholars commemorating the poet Pushkin in newspapers and magazines, which cannot help but remind me of Dostoevsky's Pushkin speech. Dostoevsky's speech is a historically valuable document in Russian literary circles. It was delivered on June 6, 1880, at the opening ceremony of the Pushkin memorial in Moscow. This ceremony was organized by the Russian Literary Friends Association, and many writers were invited to participate, with Dostoevsky and Turgenev being the two most famous.

The ceremony continued for several days. The first evening was a Pushkin poetry reading, followed by two days of banquets and speeches. The seventh was Turgenev's speech. Turgenev was still considered the most prestigious writer in the minds of most people at the time. He praised Pushkin's genius, especially his Russian genius, with his noble, cultivated, and gentle attitude. He said that he was the poet of the motherland, the supreme poet of the motherland. But at the end, he raised two questions: Did Pushkin belong to Europe? Did this great Russian have universality?

The eighth was Dostoevsky's speech. His speech was prepared a few days earlier, so when he was preparing, he did not consider Turgenev's literary views. Dostoevsky and Turgenev differed greatly in their thinking, one being a Slavophile and the other a Westernizer, and their hostility was deep due to these differences. However, by coincidence, his speech resonated with Turgenev in many places, and unintentionally answered Turgenev's questions.

"Never has there been a poet as universal as Pushkin," Dostoevsky said. "He is not only universal, but this universality is so profound that he can embrace and absorb foreign spirits in his soul; it is because of this talent that Pushkin's power is expressed. What is the power of the Russian national spirit if it is not an aspiration towards a world spirit that embraces the entire globe and all of humanity? Because Pushkin uttered the power of the nation, he foresaw and predicted its future significance. Therefore, he is a prophet. What is the significance of Peter the Great's reforms for us? These reforms are not just about adopting European clothes, customs, education, and science. People adopted those things in order to unite and love the world. There is no hostility, only friendship and affection. We incorporate all foreign geniuses into our spirit and can intuitively and quickly distinguish, eliminate contradictions, and reconcile differences; thereby, we express our readiness and desire. We, who have just united ourselves, hope to create a universal unity. The significance of the Russian race is undoubtedly European and global. To be a true Russian and to be a complete Russian, the meaning lies in this: to be a brother to all mankind, possessing universal humanity. This is called Slavophilism; … I have long believed that we—perhaps not us, but future generations of Russians—each of us will know that being a true Russian must have such a meaning; to come up with a solution, to end Europe's disputes; to point Europe to a path in the Russian soul that avoids her suffering; to inject into her a kinship of brotherhood within the four seas, and perhaps, in the end, to announce the great, ultimate message of global harmony, as the Gospel of Jesus says, that is, the eternal harmony of the friendship of all mankind."

In this section of his speech, Dostoevsky was no less than issuing a declaration for Slavophilism, but his Slavophilism is by no means comparable to general narrow nationalism (Chauvinism). It contains a lofty ideal: internationalism.

The enthusiastic emotions that the audience was aroused by this speech were unprecedented and almost unbelievable. As soon as he took the stage, a long burst of applause made it impossible for him to begin speaking. He finally spoke, but every section and every paragraph was constantly interrupted by applause. He spoke excitedly and powerfully, and when he finally spoke of universal love, the entire auditorium seemed to have gone mad. The joyful shouts of the audience were truly indescribable; they cried, hugged, and vowed to love each other. Ladies, government officials, and students all crowded in front of him, hugging him and kissing him. Two old men came up to him and said, "We have been enemies for twenty years; but we have just reconciled—through you. You are our saint, our prophet." Then there was a roar from the whole hall: Prophet! Prophet! His enemy Turgenev also ran over, hugging him tightly, with tears in his eyes, and said, "You are a genius, more than a genius." The poet Aksakov jumped onto the podium and loudly told the audience that his speech was not just a speech, but a historical event. The students swarmed over. One student, with tears streaming down his face, fell at his feet and fainted. The Russian Literary Friends Association immediately elected him as an honorary member. Again, there was a frenzy of cheers. According to the program, Aksakov should have spoken next, but Aksakov was willing to abstain. He said, "Our genius Dostoevsky has said everything and solved everything." At this time, Dostoevsky was very tired and wanted to leave and rest, but the audience would not let him leave. They prepared a huge laurel wreath, and at the end of the meeting, more than a hundred women jumped onto the podium and placed it on his head in front of the entire audience. "We represent all the women of Russia, you spoke so well for them." Everyone shed tears. Enthusiastic cheers resounded throughout the auditorium again.

The poet Pushkin was a prophet who sang of liberation and freedom, and now true liberation and freedom have been realized in his motherland. The novelist Dostoevsky was also a prophet in his Pushkin speech. He prophesied global harmony and universal love for all mankind; but now the world is full of gunpowder, and butchers are shamelessly provoking national hatred. The Russian people, with their decades of arduous struggle, finally enjoyed the poet's prophecy on the centenary of the poet's birth. Then, the people of the world today will surely use the same arduous struggle to realize the novelist's prophecy—the day of this realization may come even before the centenary of this prophet.

### The Youth of Pushkin – W. Eaworsky

### Continued Records of Love in Mountain Country

— Han Gu

When young men and women in Yulong become acquainted, there are two ways they gather:

One is "getting up extremely early." That is, they agree on the first day to meet on the hillside the next day at dawn. When the sky is turning fish-belly white, with a few scattered stars hanging in the sky, and the mountains and forests are lying quietly, with the Jinsha River seemingly not yet awake, the girl waits very early at the agreed place. Seeing the boy coming, she opens her throat and sings:

"I say, a carrying pole with water buckets on both ends, don't joke, I'm telling you, the love hangs on that side."

The boy hears it and continues to sing:

"I say, sister! This brother would rather die under the flowering tree, don't joke, I'm telling you, bury me at the roots of the flowering tree."

The two sit in the forest, listening to the morning birds singing, smelling the fragrance of wild flowers, and whispering sweet words until the sun rises high and the mountain is filled with human shadows before reluctantly returning home.

On the way home, the girl will sing a "provincial tune" while watching the boy's back!

"Chopping water spinach leaves, both ends are empty, what two people do, only they know, swallows carrying mud must keep their mouths steady, spiders drawing silk keep it in their bellies."

The other is "melon seed cracking," which means that they meet and chat while cracking melon seeds. "Melon seed cracking" mostly takes place in the mountain forests. The girls carry some fruit, candied fruit, cakes, melon seeds, and other things to the mountain. They sit on sheepskins, and the girls gather with a few female companions, sitting in a circle, talking about each other, and singing provincial tunes, Dali tunes, Menghua tunes, and local tunes. After sitting for an hour or two, they reluctantly return home.

When it comes to festivals, such as Mid-Autumn Festival or Dragon Boat Festival, the girls make elaborate preparations to send gifts to the boys, including cakes, fruits, candied fruits, shoes (sewn by the girl herself), hats… The boys accept them without any shame because the economic power in Yulong is mostly in the hands of the girls. The girls mostly have "private savings," and their economic ability is very sufficient, so they can afford to send many things to the boys. The boys sometimes reciprocate, sometimes they don't, which is commonly called "snatching."

In Yulong, because boys and girls are betrothed to each other from a young age, it is rare for them to marry out of love. Sometimes, young men and women are too dissatisfied with the wedding date and will jump into the Jinsha River together or hang themselves in the mountain forests, but most of them bow their heads in obedience. After marrying the husband arranged by their parents and raising children, when they encounter their former lovers, they only smile at each other.

### Night on the Road to Gu'an

— Wang Shifeng

Darkness is like the tide from the edge of the sky,

Submerging the vast white future,

The Big Dipper is embedded in the high sky,

One can vaguely distinguish the ditches and roads.

On the dark and silent plain,

A dozen young people are stumbling,

Stepping on the shadows of the people in front,

Their feet rise and fall in the loose soil.

One wrong step,

A half body is covered in dirt,

Silently getting up,

And moving their feet without dusting themselves off.

"Turn to the right."

"Those in front, please walk slower,"

"Be careful, there's a pit."

"Watch out, there's a ditch."

What strings together

The intimacy of this group of unfamiliar people?

"Let's rest,"

Scattered sitting in the dirt.

"Get up—classmates!

Sha—sha—we're setting off again"

Trees seem to stand up in front of us,

And we arrive at another village.

A star-like fire of lights,

Stirs up boundless joy.

Startled barking of dogs,

Draws out surprised eyes:

A dozen young men and women,

Are rushing forward in the dark.

"How many more li to Gu'an?"

"Ten more li."

Almost finished, this dark journey!

Flashing a flashlight,

Voices are heard in the wilderness.

"Where are you from?"

"Beiping."

"Hard work! Only five more li."

The simple consolation of the sentry,

Not far, we have reached the camp.

Excitement grows under our feet.

"Tired?"

"No. How about you?"

"I'm not tired either."

What forges the strength of these young people,

Struggling in the boundless darkness,

In the deep soil?

The small courtyard is filled with early-arriving companions,

Overflowing with the songs of the flood.

The pale gas lamp,

Shines on a group coming from the darkness,

Affectionately

Smiling,

Telling,

Pummeling each other

Mud-caked brown hair, shoes and socks.

In the joyful air,

Removing the burden of the whole body.

Two sixes, two, two sevens, rewrite

### Spring River Night Moon

— Fabricated

Slightly moving, the wind on the river,

I sit alone on a stone

Looking up at the sparse stars.

Waves rush in as the boat passes,

Green grass is submerged in the water

The wind on the river, slightly moving.

Dark gray clouds connect to the undulating water,

A half-yellow face emerges from the gaps,

Light leaps in the waves.

### Drama Again

— Ling Jun

I happened to think of drama and wrote a few useless words, but unexpectedly, I stumbled upon the drama year of 1937. Since I unintentionally joined in the fun, it's all the same whether I say more or less, so it's drama again.

The drama year has just begun, and some people are worried about a shortage of scripts. This bucket of cold water is too ruthless, although the actual situation seems to indicate that this is possible. Not long ago, two theater troupes competed to stage a certain script. Now, a certain theater troupe wants to stage a certain script, but the playwright does not agree, but agrees to let another theater troupe perform it and direct it for them. But this has nothing to do with the actual shortage of scripts. The latter approach can precisely avoid the first dispute. This will naturally cause a greater shortage of scripts for theater troupes that are not supported by playwrights, but that is no longer a question of script shortage, but a question of how a theater troupe can not have the support of a playwright. Because performance rights have always been neglected, some people dare to rashly organize theater troupes, preparing to perform any available scripts they can drag in. Since this main support relies on randomness, other aspects of support feel even more random. As a result, even if there is a good script, because other conditions are not sufficient to support a theater troupe, the performance is also a failure. If staging a script requires consideration of the playwright's support, then when organizing a theater troupe, one must first consider the completeness of the conditions that can obtain the playwright's support, then the chances of failure are less, and the playwright will undoubtedly be willing to support them. Of course, assuming that there are too many theater troupes with complete conditions, and the playwrights are too few and not enough to distribute, there will still be a shortage of scripts, but we cannot say that there is a need to prepare for this assumption now. Compared to actors, our playwrights do not seem to be few.

If there are too many playwrights and nowhere to stage their scripts, they will support any theater troupe indiscriminately. Of course, some of them only seek performance and do not care about the outcome. These can be completely ignored. Some are completely mistaken in overestimating the ability of the script and the ability of the playwright. Playwrights who come from actors or can also act in plays may be the best playwrights, but they are also often the worst. If their acting skills are only ordinary, then the scripts they write do not require higher skills to perform. Our spoken drama movement has not yet created an actor who can get a particularly high evaluation, but among playwrights, there are many authors who have acted in plays. This is also the reason why some playwrights have no choice in theater troupes. Perhaps we can see some playwrights uniting to perform the plays they write themselves. If we expect that they may not be able to perform well, because it is too unrealistic, that theater troupe will not be a stable theater troupe.

Since the promotion of amateur theater to save the decline of civilized drama, there are almost no non-amateur theater troupes. At first, they were very secretive about professional drama. Now, professional and non-professional are no longer a problem. If an amateur theater troupe is required to continue performing, then even if it is amateur, it must become professional. It is said that now audiences and theater managers both have this requirement. We hope that the first one to be required can become a stable one. As mentioned above, to have a stable theater troupe, one must have the support of the playwright. And when a theater troupe's acting skills can determine the success or failure of a play, its support for the writer may be greater than the writer's support for it. A script failing due to a bad performance is the most unjust failure. Being able to re-evaluate a written script fairly is the greatest contribution to Chinese drama and the greatest help to the author. We can hardly expect a theater troupe to do this in practice, but it must have a theater troupe with such ability. And the guarantee of this ability seems to be best expressed by performing world-famous plays, which is a relatively usable method.

Since there are many plays that should be performed for the theater troupe itself, and there are many plays that should be performed for the contribution to drama, we are at least not near a script shortage, and cannot be compared with the situation in the civilized drama era, when both Chinese and foreign scripts were lacking. Saying that people are afraid of a script shortage is to defend finding materials from old operas for it, which may be too far-fetched, but I still have to mention that even if there is a script shortage, we cannot seek help from improving old operas, lest we fall again.

### Bai Wei's "Tragic Life"

— Chu Yang

Before this "tragic era" comes to an end, isn't life always "tragic"? Ancient philosophers once said that human history is a history of "struggle," and it can also be said to be a history of "tragedy"! Why do people like to watch tragedies? From ancient Greece to the present, great literary works are all tragedies. Is tragedy the root of life, the fate of mankind? If we investigate the origin of tragic art and its social value from the perspective that "literature is merely a reflection of life," it is easy to discover that tragedy expresses the reality of life.

Everyone living in a declining society, whether they are awakened or dreaming, who can escape this great historical tragedy? The life reality of an individual under the great historical tragedy is nothing but tragic.

If my view is not regarded as "pessimistic philosophy" and can be recognized as a rational observation, then I think it is extremely meaningful and interesting that Ms. Bai Wei used the four words "Tragic Life" as the title of her "Autobiography." Readers will probably not forget that she is a playwright, a passionate female poet; because she deeply understands tragic art, and she herself has experienced the tragedy of real life in family, society, and love, then her use of her own life to write a vivid history of life and title it "Tragic Life" is not something lightly applied!

"Tragic Life" can be said to be an "autobiographical novel," or a "novel-like autobiography"; but after reading it, I don't think it is a novel, nor is it an autobiography. This is a record of a woman's life, bravely fighting against the ugly feudal patriarchal society, and it is a confession of a passionate new woman who loves freedom and seeks liberation. I read Bai Wei's book with great emotion and piety, just like I am absorbed in Xu Sao's "Confessions," which is full of humanistic cries and boldly shocked the literary world.

I don't want to exaggerate anything for the author. It's best to listen to the author's own explanation. The author said: "It is not necessarily the lives of great men that are worthy of biographies. Small people may have more truth, because the smaller a person is, the less necessary it is to have many false masks, and the more they can come into contact with the darkness and cruelty of society, and even more strongly experience life and demand light and truth. But how much can a cruel society give him, and how much will it exploit him, so that he can feel more and more of the truth.

"This thing is about a 'Nora' who escaped from feudal forces, her desire to move upward, to break through all the encirclements, to fight for her own liberation and the liberation of the masses, and freedom. Unfortunately, she fell into what world, and how was everything destroyed by the cruel devil's hand, and she is still struggling in suffering, living a long and miserable life with a deep desire to move forward.

"It is a sketch, a drawing, a bold, true, pure, passionate, and naked record of a moving 'life' without any concealment. It is a fact more tragic than pear blossoms in a storm, the cry of a suffering soul in hell, it is painting, it is also poetry, it is a love affair of young men and women with different thoughts, it is also an anatomical diagram of the sexes, a product of the times, it is a clear outline of a typical personality, it is also a deep contradiction between work and love, it is the turmoil of the entire semi-colonial country, and the faint writing of colonialized national character, and it is also a red-blooded confession of a pure and passionate woman who wants to move forward."

A book, if you don't read it, no matter how you introduce it, it's useless, especially a pure and legendary book. Therefore, I don't want to describe its contents in detail in this short article. The content of "Tragic Life" can be simply said that ten years of suffering runs through the life, struggle, and struggle of a woman who escaped from the old prison city (family) and fell into a new sea of ​​suffering (society), and finally still struggles! —I am afraid it will be a struggle forever, right? —Unless this social ship can reach the bright shore—. Because a deformed love tightly entangles the protagonist of the tragedy like a poisonous snake, this book also completely uses that tortuous and complicated love as the central thread of the whole book. When you first read it, you can't imagine why a love affair has so many tendrils and vines. After you finish reading it, you will also be surprised that the great tragedy of this love life is so complex and rich, which really makes some simple and innocent young men and women deeply feel the "horror" of such love: isn't that a youth toxin? How precious is the healthy life of society! To truly understand this book, it is necessary to have a sound worldview and outlook on life, and, more importantly, a correct view of the sexes and love. This is not a book to intoxicate you, but a book to guide you to criticize. Reader! You will not hesitate to sympathize with the protagonist of the tragedy and the author of this book with your pure tears, but society is cruel, and the facts are cruel. The author did not attempt to exchange your fragile and pathetic neurotic tears with her tears, which have long flowed into a deep pool that she can jump into and be forever submerged. In order to express the truth of her life, that is, the truth of society, the author has already transcended the cruelty of the facts and expressed the truth more cruelly than the facts. Therefore, this book is not only a passionate work but also a rational work.

However, a person who can criticize, or a person who is good at sympathy, may not necessarily be able to perceive the benefits of this book. Or even some young people who have "cleanliness" about love, or look down on the theme of writing romantic love, will even feel disgusted with this book and the author. To discover the benefits, you should first grasp the following points: First, you must understand that the protagonist written in the book—that is, the author herself—is a typical passionate woman. If she were to play Shakespeare's tragedy, she would indeed be an ideal Ophelia for a great director. Her passion can be compared to any passionate female character in Goethe's books. Unfortunately, she was born in modern times, born in China, in the period of transition between old and new trends in the East; although she escaped from the ancient family, escaped from the marriage of sale, escaped from feudal ethics, and even escaped to a foreign land that was free from these old shackles, she lived a life of labor and a life of freedom. When she liberated herself, she was lost in that colorful Romantic love, and she ended up becoming a victim of "sacred love," unable to extricate herself for ten years! Furthermore, we should know the era in which our protagonist lived. She was entirely a product of the Romanticism of the May Fourth Movement—here, it not only refers to the meaning of "literature" but refers to the general situation from thought to life. At that time, the cult of aesthetics and emotions, and the supremacy of love, were rampant among new young men and women. At that time, they were full of romantic fantasies and regarded love as the primary meaning of life. The protagonist's passionate personality combined with this trend of thought created her life from then on. Although her life was not immutable, she was also advancing with the times. She also plunged into the whirlpool of the Great Revolution and participated in the social and cultural movements around 1930; but the lifeline that had been forged long ago always bound her, and she was tossed in the poisonous disease of love, surviving nine deaths and one life, and finally was "missing," leaving only a glimmer of hope for "light"! There is also one point. We cannot observe in isolation the many people and things surrounding the protagonist. Why is our protagonist's lover such a person? What kind of drama is that "Red" lady playing again? The infatuated doctor and Mr. K, her many friends, and those social lives and activities that are not described in detail, how do they constitute the protagonist's entire tragic life? We must not fail to discern her life, her thoughts, her emotions, and her admirable and shameful aspects from the protagonist's environment. We want to study the social nature of this personal tragedy: because the personal tragedy is caused by the social tragedy.

If the author could more clearly reveal the social nature of her own tragedy, the meaning of this book would be even greater; unfortunately, the focus of her writing is on the description of love. The repeated and layered writing is somewhat uneconomical in some places, which makes the reader feel tired. Her life experience spans the varied periods of the nation's history, such as the May Fourth Movement, 1925-27, September 18th, and January 28th. If she could use these major historical backgrounds as the backdrop of her life, with herself as the protagonist and center, and weave more of her life records into it, how much would it increase the brilliance of the whole book? But she has written it this way after all, and we can only forgive her for writing it "when the black clouds were so oppressive that one could not breathe."

What compelled my heartstrings as I read on and on was the author's passionate and overwhelming writing style. I remember when the author published her long novel "Bombs and Warhorses," Mr. Lu Xun praised her unique style. Her description is indeed "rough" as she said herself (many places are very "bold"), but her "roughness" does not hinder the beauty of her writing. Although there are many descriptions that are too abstract and use too many abstract words, which are objectionable, but that is another matter.

This book also has no "structure." It is entirely her own "inspiration." The entire book is in five chapters, long and short, not closely combined. Each can stand alone, and it is entirely her passionate momentum that merges them into a long river.

Finally, I am surprised that the author's vitality is still so strong after seven or eight years of chronic illness. Embracing serious illness, enduring great pain, in the horror of "the book is not finished but the body dies first," she completed this 300,000-word creation in a few intermittent months. It is truly a tragic song of "death or life?" I hope she will no longer sing this "self-tragic song," and use her life from now on to write a greater "tragic life" for the dying Chinese nation, the people seeking life in death, and the women suffering from layers of oppression. In this great "tragic life," she will begin her "history of light"!

### A News Reporter

— Lao Yan

Impressions from Fifteen Years Ago

A few days ago, I met the famous reporter Huang Jiping. He told me a story. He said that he still cannot forget this matter. The following are the words of Mr. Huang.

Mr. Huang said: "About fifteen years ago, my father suffered from anemia and was very weak. He wanted to take some tonics, but he couldn't find anything suitable for a while. My mother was so worried that she couldn't sleep or eat. She happened to see an advertisement for 'Artificial Self-Flowing Blood' in the newspaper. According to the doctor, he could try it. So I bought a dozen boxes by mail. After taking it for two months, his Qi and blood were indeed stronger. I firmly believed that 'Self-Flowing Blood' was a wonderful product for replenishing blood. After taking it continuously for a year, my father's body had recovered to health. Our family is very grateful to Wuzhou Pharmacy for creating the new medicine. Although the matter has passed for fifteen years, the impression in my mind has not been erased to this day."

Commentary

### Eating Germs and Cooking Children

— Shen Jiaqian

Just after seeing a strange person in the newspaper who could swallow all kinds of germs, now I see news of cooking children's corpses to treat leprosy. To quote an old saying, it's called "The world is so big, there is nothing that is not strange."

Situ Qi, who swallowed germs, returned from Nanjing after being rejected. When he came to Shanghai, only a few newspapers did a "feature" on him; and the Department of Health said that he had a mental illness. Whether that strange person can really eat germs, it can only end without resolution, becoming a "pending case."

Everyone who becomes a "person" wants to "live to be a hundred years old." When a child is born, the eight characters must be arranged first to see if there are any "inauspicious stars," otherwise, the blind fortune teller will first make a good sale, called "resolving the stars." It seems that after one "resolution," it is guaranteed to be long-lived. If the small life is really impatient to live and dies halfway, that is "fate," which cannot be saved by human power.

Because they are afraid of "death," people are most afraid of getting sick. As the saying goes, "Even a hero is most afraid of being worn down by illness." Even if he is a "hero," he seems unable to withstand it when he gets sick. And now science is progressing too fast. Many germs that ears have never heard of are "invented" by those "fools" in laboratories; and there are no medicines to overcome these many new germs. For example, for lung disease, even the most famous doctors in Germany and Japan have not yet invented a medicine that can directly kill tubercle bacilli. And lung disease is developing so universally. I remember that in a small school, the results of examining students showed that about 4.3 out of 10 were suffering from lung disease. Those small lives are probably "unlucky" and will be ended by tubercle bacilli. Therefore, Mr. Situ Qi's "invention" of being able to eat germs is really a savior from heaven! He seems very confident that his physical strength can resist. He can continue not to eat for fifteen days (Situ Qi's conversation with a reporter from a certain newspaper seems to be a "strange person"). Unfortunately, no one asked him to perform publicly, and he ended up as a "mentally ill person." He himself is suffering from a terrible disease.

This kind of official Fu who is not afraid of death ultimately failed. I think that other than this Mr. Situ Qi, I am afraid that it is impossible to find any real evidence to prove that human beings are not afraid of death. In fact, "fear of death" is not a "sin." Even the emperor asks for the "elixir of immortality," and a small gangster opens his head to grab food in order to live. However, because they want to "live," they cook children, which is inevitably bloody. Moreover, it is a big question whether eating dead children can cure leprosy.

However, in this world, there are many people who "kill" because they want to "live," and they always kill hundreds or thousands, as if there is a "population explosion" in this world. In comparison, Peng Chi and Tan Gu seem to be excusable, especially since they killed a "child corpse."

I really don't know when this world will stop killing. I also suspect that the "fate" of those small lives that are "encouraged to reproduce" seems to have committed some kind of inauspicious star.

### Plan for Submarine to Explore the Arctic Under the Ice

— Special

Sir Hubert Wilkins, an American explorer, is currently organizing a grand plan to explore the Arctic from underwater. People in London are paying close attention to this matter. Mr. Wilkins had a submarine built, which was originally scheduled to depart this spring. Whether it can be done depends on whether the submarine can be built in time, or it may have to be postponed for a year, which is not known. According to the current situation, the required engine and the steel needed for the submarine may not be delivered within four months, but the factory undertaking the construction is currently working hard to rush the construction. After everything is complete, it will only take two and a half months to build the submarine.

If Mr. Wilkins decides to depart this year, he must test the submarine before May 1, and then depart from Si Guan Zi Baoqin around July 1 to head to the Arctic, so as not to miss the best time for Arctic exploration. Furthermore, in the past three months, all prices have risen by at least 35%. In the past, the funds he prepared for each expedition must be 50% more than the actual number. The cost of this expedition is estimated to require 20,000 pounds, which is already a large number. If prices continue to rise, and if he cannot raise the increased expenses for a while, the important matter that he regards as immediately implemented may have to be postponed until next year.

According to Mr. Wilkins: "This is the safest of all my planned exploration works. People think that we will be trapped by ice, which is an unclear understanding of the Arctic situation. The dangerous elements this time are far less than the time in 1931 when we took the thirteen-year-old American old submarine 'Nautilus' to Antarctica. Ordinary submarines are very different from the submarines I am currently building. I would like to get a good ship so that I can let others take over and carry out the planned work. The submarine in my mind is extremely convenient, but the comfort is probably extremely small. When it is submerged underwater, it weighs 210 tons, is 74 feet long, 14 feet wide, and has a square keel that is 2 feet wide. The hull is made of fine steel that is 7/8 inch thick, which is unbreakable. The depth of submersion is less than 50 feet. Everything is as simple as possible, because this boat is actually just an empty shell, which only contains one engine, one generator, one propulsion motor, and one large storage battery. There is no decoration on the deck, and there is no special decoration or accessories in the room. All are scientific equipment. There is also no submerged rudder or periscope in the boat, and there are no auxiliary machines at all. When we are on the surface of the water, we can use wireless electricity, about 12 hours a day. When we are submerged in the water, we can use high power to contact 600 miles away. When we leave Si Guan Zi Baoqin, we will travel an average of 50 miles per day until we reach the White Sea. I plan to stay in the Arctic for several days, and then head to Ellesmere Island to determine whether the land that Perry and Macmillan believed they saw exists. Dr. Kirk also took photos of the land. That area has been visited by aviation explorers three times before and after, but all failed. It is really dangerous to survey this area by plane, because the ice there is completely different from the ice in Antarctica. If you land on the ice, the ice will easily break. Surface ships cannot reach within hundreds of miles of this area, only submarines can reach it. Exploring with submarines is not as difficult as ordinary people expect. We will be driving under the ice and can emerge on the surface of the water in the middle of the floating ice at any time. We can see as far as 50 yards away. We don’t feel cold there. The ice, whether good or bad, is only fourteen or five feet thick. Arctic travelers also say that the average thickness of the ice is only between one and two feet. I think it would take two months to reach by ordinary methods, but it would only take about two weeks by submarine. We have a lot of work along the way, such as recording the depth of the sea, studying the composition of the water, investigating animals and plants, and measuring suction. These things have become increasingly important in the scientific world. Magnetic observation is also an important item. In short, we will conduct various polar investigations that have been done before, and several other investigations. We will carry out these many tasks in greater comfort and convenience. As for the personnel in the boat, there will be a total of seven of us. I have not yet selected them, but it is not difficult to get them, because more than 4,000 people have written to apply. It must be known that our submarines are not as complicated as ordinary submarines, so driving is not difficult. In addition, we only need to take care of two hatches, and all the arrangements are very simple, so very little physical labor is used. However, our work is certainly continuous. When under ice or water, our propulsion will be limited to 12 hours a day. People talk about this matter and feel it is very dangerous, but they forget that there is a wide area of water near the Arctic, and the Arctic is also like this at a certain time. Based on my previous experience on the 'Nautilus,' I dare say that this organized expedition can be regarded as the safest of all I have ever undertaken."

Mr. Wilkins is very optimistic about the difficulties he is currently encountering, and hopes to decide soon whether to depart this year or next year. But in any case, this matter must be done. Mr. Wilkins said sincerely: "I have been planning this matter for a long time. Since Bishop Chester John Wilkins first raised this question, it has been delayed for 387 years. Now that I have seen it, I cannot but do it."

### Lucky Child

— Hong Fu

Xiao Bao is the only child of the Liu family. Because his family is wealthy, he has been spoiled by his parents since he was born. His clothes and food are especially exquisite, and he always eats sweets all day long. But although Xiao Bao's upbringing is so superior, his development is not very healthy. He is already four years old this year, but he is yellow and thin! His teeth often hurt! It often causes his parents to worry.

The Wu family's child—Xiao Mao, his family is only a middle-class family, and he has not had that superior life; but his development is very fast and very healthy. He is not yet two years old this year, but he can walk a lot of roads and can bite hard food. When people see how strong and cute he is, they call him a lucky child. In fact, there is nothing else to it. It's just because Xiao Mao's parents have been feeding Xiao Mao "Jia Le Calcium" chocolate candy since last year. This kind of candy contains nourishing ingredients, so it can achieve such an effect.

Children who often eat "Jia Le Calcium" from Wuzhou Pharmacy can become strong and lucky children.

### Dog Skin Peddler

— Li Xuan

That peddler shouted along the road:

"Dog skins for winnowing baskets!"

In the desolate village, shrouded in a deep silence, under the leaden sky, the northwest wind blew from time to time. The shadows of dusk closed the doors of every house. In the twilight, the cold wind spread its wings, and the farm animals pulled the slow two-wheeled cart, strings of intermittent bell sounds drifting from afar.

"Dog skins for winnowing baskets, winnowing baskets for money!"

The peddler stretched out his voice as he shouted. He had a tall and upright body, with a cat-skin winter hat with four pieces sewn together on his head. Many tiny white spots floated on the reed-like fluff. He wore a baggy, deep blue coarse cloth robe. His two long legs walked forward with a goose-like gait. Soon, he turned into a small alley. From under a corner of the wall, a dog came to his side, sniffed him once, and then, startled, raised its head and barked as if beaten. The skin peddler ignored it and stopped under the large overhanging eaves of an old residence. A window on the wall was pushed open, and an old woman leaned out, shouting in a sharp voice:

"Hey, the dog skin buyer!"

Then, the peddler looked around in the darkness and said:

"Whose house is it?"

The thin old woman beckoned him to her door, turned around, and sent out a large spotted dog's skin from the window. He took it and gently stroked it with his palm. The fur, like a small plush rug, slanted and shimmered with curved light. He stroked it with his hand, feeling soft and fluffy, smooth and lovable. Then, he rubbed the black and white fur against his cheek, stretched out his arm, and looked at it carefully with a tilted face before asking:

"Two winnowing baskets?"

"Two winnowing baskets plus two strings of cash!"

"That's too expensive!"

"This is a big spotted dog that we raised for four years. In the first month, those wild cubs stole the dried dates we were drying behind our back door. When our hired hand ran up, it bit a child's leg. The next morning, those rabbit bastards threw it a cooked wild turnip. It took one bite and the dog rolled around howling. That night, all of its teeth fell out. That's when my son skinned it. This skin has been tanned and is guaranteed not to leak oil. Feel it..."

"Alright, I'll give you one more string of cash."

The thin old woman took the money, held two willow winnowing baskets, turned around, and closed the black door panel.

The dog skin peddler lovingly hung the dog skin at the front of his carrying pole, looked up at the night sky filled with dark clouds. It was going to snow again. He walked along the small path frozen with mud, shouting again and again:

"Dog skins for winnowing baskets!"

Dim lights lit up in the windows of every house. Dogs barked mournfully. The night dyed the countryside with a frozen black.

Opening Segment: "Qingwen Patches the Fur Coat"

Entering and leaving the Grand View Garden diligently. The maidens are all equally graceful. Only Qingwen's delicate weeping posture stands out. Her nature is harmonious and her intentions are tender. She deeply wins the love of the Yihong Gongzi (Master of Yihong Courtyard). Every word and action delights him. Her ignorant cough turns into a serious illness. Medicine and stones are ineffective and unnatural. She is haggard and often sleepless. She keeps her illness a secret from her master. She is skillful with needles and thread, with ingenious talent. The cloak with peacock gold threads is torn and cannot be worn. She, in one night's effort, completes the patching. From then on, the burden becomes unbearable. Her beautiful face is short-lived, gone in an instant. The Gongzi's life is ill-fated, his intestines about to break. He secretly makes a hibiscus pouch by the lamp. He sighs once and sheds two tears. In the earthen mound, your life is ill-fated. Under the red gauze window, I am without destiny. Drawing out the tears of the Xiaoxiang concubine. She silently watches from across the window. Burning incense with a flower petal. Presenting a cup on the three-foot lonely grave. Romantic figures are often talented. Clouds and rain are merciless, the moon is not full. Suffering from the endless pain of life and death.

(1) Little brother. Rowing a boat to see grandma. Grandma treats me to candy. Lots of candy. Eating and laughing happily. Not enough candy. I won't come next time. (2) Little younger brother. Rowing a boat to see auntie. Auntie treats me to white pears. White pears are sweet. Farmers have a good year. White pears are sour. Farmers shed tears. (3) Little elder sister. Rowing a boat to see grandpa. Grandpa says I'm really clean. Blue cloth shirt. Calculated flat and dry. Two hands. Washed as white as lotus roots. (4) Little younger sister. Rowing a boat to see the fair. Ten small boats in a row. Don't compete to be first. Competing to be first messes up the class. Don't stop. Stopping blocks the way for pedestrians.

Movies

### Minxin News

Minxin's first production, "Mother's Love," already has high box office records everywhere. This time, "The Door of Flesh and Spirit" has finished at the Suzhou Public Hall, and the total income has exceeded "Mother's Love" by one time, which shows the audience's enthusiastic welcome to the film. The film will be shown in various places soon. Its special style, psychological depiction, heart-stirring mood, and tortuous realistic story will all give the audience a deep understanding.

"New Humanity" recently borrowed the Shanghai's grandest and magnificent Metropolitan Ballroom to shoot a dance scene, and the results were extremely satisfactory.

Since Li Keng started acting, although the roles he has played have different personalities each time, most of them have been poor children. Now Bu Wancang has specially written a play for Li Keng, in which he appears as a little gentleman, co-starring with Lin Chuchu. This film will be one of Minxin's productions this year and is tentatively titled "Little Gentleman."

The greatest scene in "New Humanity," the mass grave, will depart for Qingjiangpu soon to shoot. The actors include Lin Chuchu, Li Keng, Wang Guilin, etc. Other temporary actors, six or seven hundred people, will be recruited locally.

In addition, in "New Humanity," the boat scene of Liang Saizhu, Hu Rong, and Dai Yanwan, although only a few shots, will also be filmed in Yangzhou in order to achieve the best possible shooting effect. The location shooting team will depart at the same time as the Qingjiangpu location shooting.

Bu Wancang praises the acting performance of the newly discovered child star Li Xi to everyone he meets, and those who watched the trial performance of the excerpts the other day were all surprised and speechless.

### Cathay Screens "A Soulful Melody"

Warner Bros.' "A Soulful Melody" (Sing Me A Love Song) is a thoroughly humorous musical. Humorous stars are all on the same stage, and the plot is lively and interesting, making people laugh. Hugh Herbert plays a scion of a wealthy family with a penchant for stealing, which greatly burdens his father. At the same time, he plays the roles of father, son, and brothers, which is quite rare. Zasu Pitts plays a girl whose appearance is like Wu Yan but whose feelings are as delicate as Daiyu. James Melton plays a small-time guy who likes to joke around. Patricia Ellis plays a clerk who is treated like a vase. In addition, there are many other roles that cannot be fully described. In short, this is a unique film that is completely different from other musicals. The film will be screened at the Cathay Grand Theater starting today.

### United China News Bundle

Following "A Match Made in Heaven," United China Film Company will release two more masterpieces: the ethical film "Mother's Song," starring all of United China's stars, and "The General's Daughter," directed by He Mengfu, starring Li Zhuozhuo, Li Qing, Han Langen, and Heng Li.

Cai Chusheng's new work "Wang Lao Wu" has been released, greatly satisfying the audience's thirst. The starring actors in the film include Lan Ping and Wang Cilong.

Li Lin has joined United China and will soon be assigned to a new film project, with limitless future prospects.

"Qilin Music House" is more than halfway through filming. Currently, "Farewell My Concubine" is being filmed, with Ning Xuan and Heng Li playing Yu Ji and Xiang Yu, respectively. Ning Xuan is a newly recruited newcomer who is proficient in Peking opera.

### Da Guangming Star Sunday Additional Early Showing

American Navy Worship Service

For the past two years, the Da Guangming Cinema has lent its venue to the American Navy for worship services every Sunday morning. It is now heard that the theater authorities, due to the extreme crowding of the audience at the two afternoon screenings on Sundays, have decided that, starting this Sunday, an additional screening will be added every Sunday at 10:30 AM. The film shown will be the same as the film shown in the afternoon, and the ticket price will be 60 cents for both the balcony and the orchestra seats. This move will indeed provide a great deal of convenience to movie fans in Shanghai. As for the American Navy worship service, it will be moved to the Cathay Grand Theater on Xiafei Road as before.
