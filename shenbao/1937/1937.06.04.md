### Public Trial of the Liu Luyin Case Opens

Liu Still Denies Instigating Murder. Verdict to Be Announced After Deliberation Today.

[Hankou] The trial of the Yang Yongtai assassination case opened on the morning of the 4th. Even more people attended than the previous time. The court increased its guard.

### Legislative Yuan Revises and Passes Three Types of Police Regulations

Qualifications for Police Officer Appointments Slightly Expanded. Police Uniforms Initially Divided into Three Types.

[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan held its 106th meeting on the morning of the 4th, with 71 members including Wu Huanzhang present. Sun Ke presided as chairman, and Liang Hancao as secretary-general. Items for discussion: (1) The amendment to the Regulations on the Appointment of Police Officers was resolved to pass as reviewed by the Legislative Committee. The full text contains twelve articles. The main points of the amendment are to slightly expand the scope of qualifications for police officer appointments, changing it to a dual emphasis on academic qualifications and experience. In addition to graduates of police academies, graduates of other political, legal, and military schools who have served in the police force are also stipulated as eligible to be appointed as police officers. (2) The Regulations on Police Uniforms and Designs were resolved to pass as amended by the Legislative Committee. The full text contains four chapters and thirty-nine articles, with thirty attached designs. The main points of the regulations are to divide uniforms into three types: full dress, formal dress, and regular dress. Regular dress is worn during normal duties, and formal dress is worn during ceremonies. Police officer ranks are distinguished by regulations on collar badges, sleeve badges, shoulder boards, and arm badges for identification. Special uniforms for the highest-ranking officer in charge of national police administration are separately defined to enhance propriety and demonstrate solemnity. In addition, due to China's vast territory and differing climates between the north and south, the colors of the regular uniforms are given flexible regulations to facilitate implementation. (3) The abolition of the Organizational Law of Provincial Police Departments and the Organizational Law of the Capital Police Department was resolved to pass as reviewed by the Legislative Committee. According to item 4 of the Legislative Procedure Outline, it is recommended that the Central Political Council first send the organization outline of supervisory organs at all levels through the legislative process, and then amend the Organizational Law of Provincial Police Departments and the Organizational Law of the Capital Police Department based on this outline, and formulate regulations for county and city police organs so as not to conflict with the legislative procedure. (4) Other important cases: It is also reported that the court has changed the cigarette unified tax from a two-tier system to a four-tier system, which has been implemented for two months. It is now urging the competent department to send the Cigarette Unified Tax Regulations and the revised tax rate table to the court for review. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)

### Liu Luyin's Confession Mentions Belief in Chiang

[Hankou] The Criminal Court of the Wuchang District Court held a collegial panel at 9:00 AM on the 4th to try the Yang Yongtai assassination case. Liu Luyin wore an old navy blue velvet suit and looked ill. According to Liu Luyin's confession, he not only did not commit the crime of instigating murder in the Yang Yongtai assassination case, but he never even dreamed of such a thing. He also said that he had been following the Premier's revolution for many years, and his work had been in the field of writing, without ever having shouldered actual political responsibility. He has always been indifferent to fame and fortune, which is why he was willing to sacrifice his positions as Minister of Propaganda and Vice President of the Examination Yuan to travel south to seek the unity of the Party and the country. Since he is indifferent to fame and fortune, it is impossible to talk about competing with others for power and profit. He has had a history of more than twenty years in the Party, and he especially believes in and loves Chairman Chiang. After the Xi'an Incident occurred last year, he was very worried about Chairman Chiang's safety. He did not advocate a military conquest and published a statement in the Hong Kong newspapers. As for his friendship with Yang Yongtai, if Yang's family has financial difficulties, he can provide help based on personal feelings, but it is not a legal obligation. He finally said that he had nothing to do with the Yang Yongtai assassination case and had no time to do anything but love and protect Chiang because Chiang is a believer in the Premier and an important person responsible for the central government, proving that he has never participated in any work investigating Chiang's actions.

The commission was composed of two Chinese and two British officials, with a Swiss military officer appointed by the League of Nations as a neutral chairman. The commission has completed its work of delineating the treaty boundary line on the map and has proposed some revisions to the treaty boundary line, which is almost identical to that defined in 1900. The signing of the report and map is the first step towards the final resolution of the Burma-Yunnan border issue. According to the exchange of notes between the British Ambassador and the Chinese Foreign Minister in 1935, the results of the commission's investigation will now serve as the basis for negotiations between the Chinese and British governments in a spirit of mutual harmony and concession, and the report and the results of the investigation will be included in a new treaty between the two governments. Until the new treaty is concluded, both governments will retain their existing positions. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 3rd)

London Correspondence

### British Attitudes Towards the Spanish Incident (Part 2)

— Our European Correspondent, Lie Shan

Under the influence of such public opinion, the Baldwin government's policy of neutrality was fraught with problems, giving the opposition parties opportunities to attack and falling into a difficult situation. The current predicament of the British government is no less than that of the Italian-Abyssinian War era. Even within the government party, many members "rebelled," cooperating with the opposition parties—the Labour Party and the Liberal Party. For example, the famous Conservative MP, the Duchess of Atholl, publicly served as the chairman of the "Spanish Relief Society." Her rhetoric in the House of Commons attacking the intervention of Germany and Italy in the Spanish Civil War was so intense that it gave the government party a headache. She recently went to the front lines in Madrid with two female Labour MPs to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. (In Madrid, they almost lost their lives under the gunfire of Franco's troops.) She personally gave a speech on the Madrid radio station, advising the British and people around the world to do their best to help the Spanish "Popular Front" government. After returning to England, she campaigned everywhere for the Popular Front government. It is conceivable that the attitude of this old duchess towards the Spanish incident was even more radical than that of the leftists.

What Baldwin currently finds difficult to deal with seems to be the domestic opposition parties. Many Conservative members of society who have been to Spain have returned and unanimously, directly or indirectly, attacked General Franco and Germany and Italy. The rhetoric of this group of people has gradually spread to the public, forming a kind of public opinion dissatisfied with the current government (the recent by-election for a Member of Parliament in the Wimbledon constituency of London is proof that the Labour Party snatched a seat from the Conservatives). Therefore, when General Franco announced the blockade of the port of Bilbao a month ago, it immediately aroused the resentment of the British people. Although Prime Minister Baldwin did not formally recognize Franco's blockade plan, he publicly warned British merchant ships not to sail into the port of Bilbao, otherwise they would be responsible for any danger. This timid attitude of his aroused even more dissatisfaction among the public. At the same time, the military and civilians in the port of Bilbao felt a panic about food due to the interruption of sea routes. As a result, the eyes of the world were focused on Britain again. In the House of Commons, Labour and Liberal MPs successively raised serious questions, finally forcing Admiral Hoare to agree that if British merchant ships were attacked by Franco's warships (referring to international waters more than three nautical miles off the Spanish coast), the British Navy had an obligation to protect the merchant ships. Exceptionally, in this incident of transporting food to relieve the people of Bilbao, France and Russia deliberately stepped back. As a result, the British had to come forward themselves. The Labour Party, the Independent Labour Party, and the Liberal Party and other groups have successively raised funds everywhere, preparing to purchase food and break through Franco's blockade. Even the Liberal leader, Lloyd George, donated £290. At the same time, he also said that he was also a Basque, just like General Foch. The Welsh and the Basques are one family. (Note: Lloyd George is Welsh) Not only did many scholars attack Franco's "atrocities," but even several famous church pastors also gave public speeches, preparing to purchase a merchant ship in the name of the church to transport food to Bilbao. (The most severe point of Franco's attack on the other side was that the "Popular Front" government was anti-religious. As soon as the people in the British Church came forward, Franco's propaganda immediately lost its effect). Under such a situation of public outrage, the protection of the British fleet was finally obtained, and three British merchant ships were the first to break through Franco's blockade. The problem of the food panic in Bilbao was resolved.

After the blockade of Bilbao was resolved, as a result of the continuous advance of Franco's troops by land, the British target shifted to relieving the women and children in the area. The first batch of 5,000 women and children has been safely transported out (also as a result of the protection of the British warships) and will be distributed to Britain and France for resettlement. According to the plan of the British "Spanish Relief Society," they also intend to transport all the women and children in batches to safe areas outside the war zone, and most of them will be resettled by Britain.

Regarding the Spanish incident, the British have gradually shifted from passive neutrality to active assistance to the "Popular Front" government, although it is currently limited to relief work. This is naturally the result of the influence of public opinion. This attitude of Britain immediately received severe criticism from Germany and Italy, saying that Britain was intentionally taking sides. Mussolini today ordered all Italian journalists stationed in Britain to be recalled. British newspapers, except for three newspapers that slightly sympathized with General Franco, were all banned from entering the country. The Anglo-Italian relationship was once again strained.

We know that the Spanish incident is an international event. Currently, the helpers of both sides are showing their skills. Not only is there no hope of resolving the dispute for a while, but there may be surprising new developments in the near future. In the meantime, the attitude of the British is worth noting. However, it would be wishful thinking to expect the British government, led by the Conservative Party, to use its strength to uphold international justice! (May 12)

Current Commentary

### The Konoe Cabinet and the Hirota Diplomacy

— Hua

After Hayashi Senjuro resigned, the Japanese government was succeeded by Prince Konoe Fumimaro, who formed a new cabinet. The new cabinet was formally established yesterday. Among the list of names announced, the most notable figures are Hirota Koki and Baba Eiichi. Hirota was the first advocate of the Three Principles towards China. The impression he has left in the minds of the Chinese people is undoubtedly deep. This time, he is reassuming the post of foreign minister, which will have a significant impact on Sino-Japanese relations. Baba was the Finance Minister during the Hirota Cabinet era and made the greatest efforts in planning huge military expenditures for the control of industrial economy. This time, he is assuming the post of Home Minister and also concurrently serving as the Director-General of the Planning Agency, which shows that his relationship with the military and fascists remains consistent and has not changed. Judging from such a selection of personnel, the Konoe Cabinet's policy towards China will probably be more active than that of the Hayashi Cabinet.

A Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo the day before yesterday stated that "Hirota's reappointment at least indicates that the Konoe Cabinet's diplomatic policy places emphasis on China and the Soviet Union." This observation is correct. We feel that the changes in the Japanese cabinet in recent months, in terms of diplomatic figures, from Hirota to Sato and then from Sato back to Hirota, shows that Sato's European and American-oriented broad diplomacy was like a flash in the pan and has become a thing of the past. Now, we are returning to the original focus, with diplomacy towards China as the sole focus. Hirota's re-emergence immediately reminds us of the Three Principles of the past. This has a painful relationship with us, which we cannot ignore in the slightest.

Naturally, in the current situation in the Far East, Sino-Japanese relations are indeed the only major issue. The Konoe Cabinet's emphasis on its China policy is also a matter of course. However, because this issue has a vital stake in our country's interests, we cannot but offer some opinions at this time for the other side to consider.

First, we believe that if Foreign Minister Hirota's re-emergence is still based on the Three Principles towards China of the past, then there is absolutely no possibility of improving Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese people now have a consciousness of independence and liberation, and they are all determined to protect their rights and recover their territory. The humiliation of the past can no longer be tolerated. We certainly hope for peaceful coexistence between nations and for the restoration of normalcy in the Far East, but this responsibility cannot be sought from China but lies in the self-reflection of the aggressors.

Second, the current situation in the Far East has produced various new factors that did not exist a few months or half a year ago. The most important is the development of China's peaceful unification and the increasing anti-aggression atmosphere on the Pacific coast. Since last winter, China's spirit of unity and resistance to aggression has been fully demonstrated. In the future, the strengthening of China's national strength is an important factor in stabilizing the situation in the Pacific. As for the anti-aggression tendencies of other countries on the Pacific coast, it can be seen from the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomacy and from the recent situation of the British Imperial Conference. In short, in the future Pacific, the desire for peace of the majority of countries will not allow any ambitious person to take adventurous aggressive actions.

We all know that the changes in all situations are advancing with time. In recent months, Japan has indeed had several changes in its parliament and cabinet, and the situation in China and the entire Pacific is constantly changing and developing. But we do not know whether Foreign Minister Hirota's Three Principles will also change with the times and be revised.

### Hirota Again Leads Diplomacy

"Demotion" or "Promotion" Not Taken into Account, Wish to See Diplomatic Policies Revised and Implemented

[Tokyo] Former Prime Minister Hirota has been "demoted" to Foreign Minister and has reappeared before the people. However, after all, he is a former prime minister, and he has never gone to the cabinet headquarters, but has received requests to accept the position at home. His leisurely attitude can be seen from this. He said, "I am returning to my old nest this time. Demotion or promotion is not the issue. I grew up in the 'field of foreign affairs,' so agreeing to take office as Foreign Minister is only natural. At this time of complex international problems, I am happy to accept this task." Everyone already knows what kind of person Hirota is, so he will not take new approaches. I only know to serve the country.

According to general observations, the joining of former Prime Minister Hirota into the Konoe Cabinet as Foreign Minister is a representation of Hirota's own plan to complete his diplomatic career. Therefore, his diplomatic policies will be based on the consistent diplomatic policies implemented by the Foreign Ministers Hirota, Arata, and Sato after inheriting the scorched-earth diplomacy. Make partial revisions according to changes in the situation, and continue to implement what should be continued.

Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, after succeeding in the transfer of the North Manchuria Railway during the era of Foreign Minister Hirota, fell into stagnation again due to the conclusion of the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact last fall. Therefore, the new Foreign Minister Hirota will continue the plan of the former Foreign Minister Sato, to attempt to adjust Japan-Soviet relations by reopening the Border Dispute Settlement Committee and convening the Manchuria-Soviet Border Demarcation Committee. Considering Foreign Minister Hirota's strong character in resolving the issue of the transfer of the North Manchuria Railway, there are great expectations for him to resolve the border issues, fishery issues, and various other outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union.

Regarding relations with China, because the new Foreign Minister is the so-called proponent of the Three Principles towards China, it is worth noting what policies will be taken towards this basic goal. According to observations, it is feared that he will adapt to the new situation after the breakdown of negotiations in Nanjing and will move towards opening the path to Japan-China relations by resolving fair and appropriate outstanding issues. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Hirota will naturally inherit the Anglo-Japanese talks that have already been completed by Foreign Minister Sato. Moreover, Foreign Minister Hirota's long-held wish is to cooperate and be friendly with all nations in its diplomacy toward China. Therefore, he will make great efforts in Anglo-Japanese negotiations in the future. In short, the cooperation between Prime Minister Konoe, who advocates Pan-Asianism, and Foreign Minister Hirota, who uses universal harmony as his slogan, can be expected to open up the dead end of today's diplomacy, (Allied dispatch on the 4th)

### Japan and Germany Advance Cultural Cooperation

Fujisawa Meets with German Dignitaries

[Berlin] Dr. Fujisawa, the president of the Japan Cultural League, who is currently here, met today with German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels, Director of the Foreign Affairs Division of the Nazi Party Rosenberg, German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop (who signed the Anti-Comintern Pact on the German side), an official of the subordinate staff member of Rome, and several staff members of the German university student exchange office. They consulted on ways to enhance the mutual relations between German and Japanese universities and to promote close spiritual cooperation between university students from both sides, so as to establish a cultural agreement. Dr. Fujisawa also released a statement saying that German government officials, especially Mr. Rosenberg, are very interested in the plan I proposed. I believe that the German personnel sent to Japan for inspection should be limited to politicians and scientists who adhere to Nazism, and Japan should send diplomats and scientists with similar ideas to Germany. Dr. Fujisawa is scheduled to go to Rome tomorrow, and then return to China from the port of Naples on the Japanese cruiser "Ashigara," (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th)

### The International Labor Conference Continues to Meet

Chinese Labor Representatives Suggest Discussing Smuggling Issues

[Geneva] The 23rd International Labor Conference continued to meet this afternoon. The government representatives of the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, and Mexico were elected as members of the conference's proposal committee. In addition, the employers' and labor representatives each elected a presidium. Chinese employer representative Nie Guangyu and labor representative Zhu Xuefan have both been elected. Chinese labor representative Zhu Xuefan has submitted a draft resolution to the conference, requesting the board of directors of the International Labor Office to discuss the smuggling problem in certain areas of China, saying that the total amount of smuggling in China reaches 300 million yuan, which has a great impact on the economic relations between China and various countries. Zhu Xuefan and Belgian labor representative Mottin, as well as the Japanese and Indian labor representatives, jointly submitted three draft resolutions, requesting the International Labor Council to consider various methods to ensure that the Chinese government's various social laws can be implemented in these concessions and foreign territories by working together with the authorities of China and the concessions and foreign territories, (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 3rd)

### Japanese and American Businesses Request Reduced Pacific Cable Fees

[Washington] Japanese and American merchants have recently filed a complaint, believing that the Pacific cable is more expensive than the Atlantic cable.

### A Certain Party in England Attempts to Harm China's Credit Through Propaganda

[Paris] A major London newspaper published an article about a week ago discussing the Chinese government's military spending. Our reporter recently inquired about this matter with a certain financial figure here who is familiar with Chinese political and financial affairs. According to his reply, the items mentioned in the newspaper are not accurate. This article may have been written at the instigation of a certain party, in order to undermine the mission of Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi in Europe, which is not impossible. According to those in charge, in recent years, China's military spending has been budgeted in detail in advance and rigorously audited afterwards. Furthermore, the Chinese government has been making great efforts in finance in recent years, and the Chinese government has reorganized all financial affairs to make them orderly, thereby stabilizing finance and restoring credit. This phenomenon is unprecedented in modern Chinese history, (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th)

### Inauguration of the Japanese Cabinet, Konoe Announces Aspirations

Exerting Efforts to Eliminate Domestic Confrontational Situations, Seeking to Establish "Genuine Peace" Externally

[Tokyo] Since accepting the imperial command, Prince Konoe has been diligently working on forming a cabinet. On the morning of the 4th, at 10:00 AM, he met with Yoshino Shinji, president of the Northeast Industries Corporation, and decided on his appointment as Minister of Commerce and Industry. With the selection of all cabinet members complete, he entered the Imperial Palace at 1:30 PM today to pay homage to the Emperor, answer the imperial command, and present the list of cabinet members. The Emperor graciously approved, and Prince Konoe withdrew. Subsequently, the Emperor issued an order to hold the ceremony of imperial appointment. Prince Konoe and all cabinet members, dressed in formal attire, entered the palace at 2:30 PM. The Emperor, in ordinary formal attire, accompanied by Chief Chamberlain Hyakutake and Military Aide-de-Camp Usami, proceeded to the Phoenix Room at 3:00 PM. With the retained Minister of the Navy, Yonai Mitsumasa, in attendance, the ceremony of imperial appointment for the Prime Minister was held first. To Prince Konoe, who advanced before the Emperor, the imperial edict of appointment as Prime Minister was bestowed, and the seal was conferred by Minister Yonai. The Emperor then retired. At 3:30 PM, the Emperor returned to the Phoenix Room to hold the ceremony of imperial appointment for the other cabinet ministers. With the new Prime Minister Konoe in attendance, the imperial edicts of appointment were bestowed in order, and the seals were conferred by Prime Minister Konoe. The ceremony concluded, and the Konoe Cabinet was officially established. The cabinet list is as follows:

Konoe Fumimaro, Prime Minister; Hirota Koki, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Baba Eiichi, Minister of Home Affairs; Kaya Okinori, Minister of Finance; Yasui Eiji, Minister of Education; Count Arima Yoriyasu, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry; Yoshino Shinji, Minister of Commerce and Industry; Nagai Ryutaro, Minister of Communications; Nakajima Chikuhei, Minister of Railways; Otani Son'yu, Minister of Colonial Affairs;

Furthermore, the resignations of the Army Minister and Director-General of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs, General Sugiyama Gen, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa, and the Minister of Justice, Koizumi Kichihiko, who were to remain in office, were returned to the Emperor. The resignations of the other cabinet members, including Prime Minister Hayashi, were approved. (4th, Dentsu)

[Tokyo] After the first cabinet meeting, the new Prime Minister Konoe announced the new cabinet's political platform and policies in the form of a statement. The details of the political platform cannot be revealed at this time. Here, I will briefly discuss the general outline of its significance. On the day I received the order to form the cabinet, I also stated that if domestic conflict continues and we undermine each other, the arrival of external humiliation is greatly to be feared. Therefore, I intend to make every effort to alleviate friction. All conflicts related to interests and party factions should take into account the current extraordinary situation, and each person should make efforts to restrain themselves in order to reduce disputes. As for conflicts arising from misinterpretations of the times, although they are to some extent unavoidable, if we seriously study the internal and external situations, move away from our own positions, and discuss solutions, then such extreme conflicts can be eliminated invisibly. However, simply saying "let's reconcile" is an unreasonable demand. Therefore, we should eliminate confrontational situations under guiding principles. Adopting this approach is the cabinet's mission. Concrete measures will be proposed during cabinet meetings. In general, I believe that we cannot simply maintain the status quo externally. We must establish genuine peace based on international justice. As for internal affairs, we should make every effort to realize reforms based on social justice. Today, many issues that need immediate reform both internally and externally are piled up like mountains. If the cabinet tries to handle them all one by one, it may be difficult to do so. At today's first cabinet meeting, I also told the cabinet members that the cabinet should work together, put aside minor differences and focus on common goals, and do everything possible to make progress. All citizens must work together to promote innovation and strive to increase national prosperity. As for the specific details, they will be announced later. What I hope for today is to shake hands with all citizens and hope that all citizens will provide assistance. (4th, Domei News Agency)

### New Finance Minister Kaya

### Finance Minister Kaya Discusses Economic Policies

National Defense and People's Livelihood Should Be Considered Together

[Tokyo] After the first cabinet meeting, the new Finance Minister Kaya discussed the fundamental principles of the new cabinet's economic policy as follows: Under the current circumstances, there are many matters that must be implemented regarding national defense and the people's livelihood, and we should actively proceed with them. However, if the means of implementation are not complete, we cannot rush forward. Therefore, we must make every effort to cultivate national strength in order to achieve our goals. At the same time, if we exceed the economic power of cultivation, it will lead to confusion in the economic sphere, and the economic power itself will decline. As a result, it will run counter to expanding national defense and stabilizing the people's livelihood. Therefore, we should consider this point. From this perspective, establishing policies suitable for international balance of payments, as well as concrete policies for expanding productive capacity, and policies suitable for the supply and demand of materials are all matters that should be implemented urgently. As for solutions to the problem of commodity prices, they are fundamentally included in the above three items. The government must work hard on this matter, but it should be assisted by all citizens working together in order to achieve results. Expanding productive capacity should be based on establishing an integrated Japan-Manchuria industrial plan as a matter of urgency. In short, I believe that the foundation of financial policy should be planned and implemented in accordance with principles, and it depends on the self-awareness of the people in order to implement self-determination. Economic controls should absolutely not be imposed, and should be handled in accordance with public opinion. This is the belief that I hold. (4th, Domei News Agency)

### Colonial Minister is a Monk

[Tokyo] The "title" of the new Colonial Minister, Otani Son'yu, is as an advisor to the Nishi Hongwanji sect and the head priest of Zenpukuji Temple, the Kobe branch temple of the same sect. It is the first time in his life that he has leapt from a monk to a Colonial Minister. He was appointed as a member of the House of Peers by imperial decree in Showa 3 (1928) and has been there for ten years. (4th, Domei News Agency)

### French Government's Foreign Policy

Maintaining Peace as the Goal

[Paris] The day before yesterday marked the anniversary of the establishment of the French Popular Front government. Prime Minister Blum gave an interview to a reporter from the British "Daily Herald" regarding the domestic and foreign policies implemented by the government over the past year. The section on foreign policy stated, "In the platform we announced when forming the cabinet, we declared that we would restore Europe's confidence in peace. We have always adhered to this policy. European countries should know that we have always adopted a faithful attitude towards our obligations and ideals. Our ultimate goals are nothing more than the following: (1) Establishing a collective security system through arbitration; (2) Mutual assistance; (3) General preparatory inspections." Relations between Germany and the countries of the Anglo-Belgian-Turkish-American Little Entente and the Scandinavian countries have become increasingly harmonious. In short, France is prepared to cooperate with all nations to maintain world peace. (4th, Havas from Central News Agency)

### Kong and Chen, Special Envoys, Observe French Air Force Exercises

Mr. Kong Also Invited to a Banquet by the French Minister of Finance

[Paris] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, accompanied by Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, Military Attaché Major General Wen Yingxing, Colonel Wang Chengfu, Lieutenant Colonel Zhou Yingcong, Secretary Yang Guangsheng, and others, went to the Le Bourget airfield near Paris in the morning to observe French Air Force exercises. The scale of the exercises was rarely seen by Chinese politicians abroad. The friendship between China and France is clearly demonstrated here. When Dr. Kong Xiangxi and his party arrived at the airfield, they were personally greeted by General Pesche, commander of the Second Air Region of France (France is divided into four air regions, the Second Region including Paris is the most important), representing Aviation Minister Cot and the representative of the Army Chief of Staff. At that time, the national flags of China and France fluttered in the wind, and two hundred soldiers presented arms to the distinguished Chinese guests. The Air Force band played the national anthems of China and France. Dr. Kong Xiangxi and General Pesche walked and inspected the aircraft parked in the field, including forty bombers and twenty-eight fighter planes. Soon after, the aircraft took off one after another, formed formations, and flew over the reviewing stand in an orderly manner. Dr. Kong Xiangxi and his party subsequently visited various facilities inside the airfield. At noon, General Pesche hosted a banquet at the airfield to entertain the Chinese dignitaries. At the end of the banquet, Pesche gave a speech, praising the ancient culture of China. He also stated that Dr. Kong Xiangxi not only represents China but is also a descendant of Confucius, and he has done much to stabilize the political situation in China. China, France, and the United States are the three great democratic republics in the world, so France is very interested in the enterprises currently being undertaken by the Chinese government. He was particularly pleased that the Air Force had the opportunity to be reviewed by Dr. Kong and the others, and said that although the French Air Force is strong, it has no intention of attacking other countries and will only use it for self-defense. Dr. Kong Xiangxi then gave a reply, briefly stating that he, in the name of the Chinese government and people, thanked the French government and people. He said that the two great democracies of China and France should cooperate with each other to promote world peace and progress. (3rd, Havas)

[Paris] French Finance Minister Olivar hosted a banquet last night (the 3rd) to welcome Vice President Kong Xiangxi. Olivar said in his speech that since Vice President Kong used scientific methods to stabilize finance in China, the country has made rapid progress, and Vice President Kong's decisive spirit is greatly commendable. He went on to say that cooperation between China and France will become even closer. Vice President Kong then gave a reply in Chinese, translated by Weng Wenhao, briefly stating that he had come to France with two purposes: one was to visit the leaders of France, and the other was to study the progress of French economics and industry. He said that China is currently in a critical period of construction, so he came to France to study the situation in order to learn from it. Kong subsequently expressed his gratitude to the French government for its gracious hospitality and solemnly declared that China and France share similar democratic ideas. Since the two countries have expressed mutual sympathy for democratic ideals, cooperation between China and France should become even closer, and it should not only be sincere cooperation but also substantive cooperation. Vice President Kong has two more days to spend in France and will be busy with social engagements. The most important is the meeting with French Chamber of Deputies Speaker Herriot. The French government will formally host a banquet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the day after tomorrow. Vice President Kong and his party are scheduled to leave France for Brussels on Sunday.

### Mola, Northern Front Commander of the Western Rebel Army, Dies in a Plane Crash

Vacancy to be Filled by Davila, Significant Blow to the War Situation

⊙Bilbao Radio stations in Salamanca and Vitoria controlled by the Nationalist forces announced that General Mola, commander of the Northern Front of the Nationalist army, died in a plane crash today while conducting reconnaissance over the Basque front. The plane crashed in the fog, killing the general, two staff officers, and two pilots. Mola, along with Generalissimo Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army, and General Queipo de Llano, commander of the Southern Front, was one of the three pillars of the right wing. His sudden death has greatly demoralized the Nationalist leaders. On May 18, after capturing Amorebieta, a town halfway between Durango and Bilbao, Mola began a full-scale offensive against the Bilbao Iron Belt in order to fulfill his long-held desire. Unexpectedly, he died before his mission was accomplished. When Rivera was the dictator of Spain, Mola was the organizer of the secret police. (3rd, Reuters from Central News Agency)

[Paris] Radio stations reported the details of General Mola's death, stating that Mola's plane emerged from the clouds in a valley near Briviesca in the province of Burgos and crashed into a cliff. The entire plane was destroyed. General Mola's body was found 20 yards from the plane. (4th, Kokumin Haitong News)

⊙Salamanca General Nono of the Nationalist army reported the details of General Mola's plane crash on the radio station here last night. Nono announced that General Mola flew to Valladolid yesterday morning, but on the way in Burgos, the plane Mola was in was shrouded in dense clouds, making it impossible to distinguish the direction, and it crashed into the foothills. Mola and the pilot were thrown out of the plane, a long distance from where the plane landed. The accident occurred at about 10:30 AM on June 3. After completing his report, Nono claimed that although General Mola had died, his spirit was immortal. (4th, Kokumin Haitong News)

⊙Salamanca Following the death of General Mola in a plane crash, General Davila, director of the Nationalist government's technical institute, was appointed by Generalissimo Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army, as commander of the Nationalist army in this province of Biscay in the north. General Saliquet, former commander of the Seventh Division, was appointed as commander of the Nationalist army in the province of Castile and Aragon, succeeding General Mola. According to a radio broadcast issued by the Nationalist authorities, General Mola's plane crashed en route to the city of Valladolid in the northwest. Also killed were Lieutenant Colonel Pozas and two other officers. Mola was known for his outstanding military achievements in suppressing the indigenous rebel tribes in Spanish Morocco. During the terms of Spanish dictator Rivera and former Governor-General of Morocco, Berenguer, Mola served as director of the National Investigation Department and made great contributions to suppressing revolutionary elements. Later, when Fascist Popular Party leader Robles became Minister of the Army, Mola was appointed commander-in-chief of the garrison in Morocco. Last year, he launched a rebellion at the same time as General Franco. The Nationalist army's siege of Madrid and the port of Bilbao were both under the command of General Mola.

### German Head of State Sends Condolences

[Berlin] Upon receiving news of General Mola's death, Hitler immediately sent a telegram to Generalissimo Franco, commander-in-chief of the Western Nationalist army, expressing condolences. The telegram read, "The German people express their deep sympathy for the loss suffered by the Western Nationalist army due to the death of General Mola. Please accept my most sincere expressions of sympathy. General Mola's name will be forever immortalized in the history of Spain's efforts to seek reform." (4th, Kokumin Haitong News)

### Mola's Brief Biography

Mola was a Basque, born in 1891 in a village at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains. In his youth, he aspired to art, but due to his father's wishes, he entered the Army University of Pamplona. After entering the military, he rose rapidly. In 1931, he was appointed Inspector General of the National Police of Spain. When the government became extremely leftist, the rift between General Mola and the government gradually deepened. He was arrested in June 1936. Therefore, after General Franco declared war on the Popular Front government, General Mola immediately became commander of the Northern Front. (Kokumin Haitong News)

⊙Bilbao According to radio reports here, the Basque army launched a fierce attack on the Amorebieta line this morning, resulting in a major victory. They captured several positions, and the Nationalist army under Mola suffered heavy losses and was utterly defeated. When the Basque army attacked, they first bombed with artillery, followed by an infantry charge. When the Nationalist army retreated, the government forces captured countless machine guns, war trophies, and prisoners. (3rd, Kokumin Haitong News)

### Cooperation Methods for Overseeing the Western Sea by Various Nations

England Separately Probes Italy, Germany, and France; Germany Expected to Accept in Principle

[London] According to authoritative sources here, England's proposal regarding the reorganization of the Spanish observation fleet to obtain joint security guarantees has been delivered to the French, German, Italian, and Spanish governments and political figures in the form of a series of questions. It is confirmed that the content of the proposal is the same as reported and it is hoped that the countries concerned will accept it quickly, so that it can be submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee immediately. Well-informed sources say that the Soviet Union has not expressed any opposition to the proposal. (National Marine Telegraph on the 4th)

[Berlin] General opinion here believes that the German government will accept the British proposal in principle, but may raise some questions regarding the handling of suspicious incidents and ways to prevent the Western government forces from repeating offensive actions. The German government deeply hopes that the safe zone system proposed by the British can be realized as soon as possible. (National Marine Telegraph on the 4th)

[London] A responsible person recently stated that the British ambassadors to France, Italy, and Germany have been ordered to engage with the governments of their respective countries this afternoon to explore ways for these countries to participate in guaranteeing security with observation warships. The British side has now put forward two suggestions: one is to expand the system of setting up safe zones, and the other is for the fleets of all countries participating in the observation to cooperate. Regarding the first point, the British advocate asking both parties involved in the Spanish civil war to provide guarantees for respecting safe zones. Regarding the second point, the so-called cooperation of fleets of various countries refers to the fact that when a warship of a country participating in the observation is attacked, it should consult with other countries to determine appropriate countermeasures. The intention of the British proposal is to avoid adopting a forceful approach. Germany initially requested that the fleets of all countries participating in the observation should adopt a joint and consistent system, but Britain opposed this system for fear that it would involve Britain too deeply in the Spanish civil war. As a result, France proposed a cooperative system, that is, if an accident occurs, the countries participating in the observation can consult with each other to avoid unnecessary complications. What Britain is proposing now is this cooperation method. Also, this afternoon, the Italian Ambassador to England, Grandi, and the German Ambassador to England, Ribbentrop, visited the Foreign Office one after another. The Foreign Office informed them of the situation of the British ambassadors to Italy and Germany in Rome and Berlin. Official personnel now hope that the results of the negotiations will satisfy all parties. It is heard that the German government is already prepared to accept the British plan, but the Italian opinion is still unknown. In addition, according to well-informed sources, regarding the inspection of foreign inspectors on warships participating in the observation, some experts are now considering a plan that advocates allowing foreign naval inspectors to exercise surveillance on auxiliary ships participating in the observation, because these auxiliary ships probably have no technical secrets. However, the British naval community hopes that the general outline of the security guarantee plan should first reach a compromise in principle by the countries concerned before various special issues can be determined.

### League of Nations Fails to Handle Sino-Japanese Case

British Imperial Conference Brings Up Old Issues

[London] During today's meeting of major representatives of the Imperial Conference, the failures of the League of Nations in handling the previous Manchurian Incident and the Abyssinian affair were brought up again. It was generally felt that if the League of Nations Covenant needs to be amended in the future, special attention should be paid to Article 16 of the Covenant regarding sanctions. From the perspective of the British Empire, the League of Nations should strive to maintain its life and should remove as much as possible the obstacles preventing other countries from joining or returning to the League of Nations. However, there was no specific conclusion on the reform of the League of Nations at this meeting. It is expected that discussions will continue next week. Furthermore, it is said that the issue of trusteeships was not mentioned. At present, general matters in the Imperial Conference have generally come to an end, and it has been decided to hold the final meeting on the 15th of this month.

### New Record Set for London Gold Market Transactions

Authorities Absorb as Much as Possible; Hoarders Panic

[London] This morning, at the closing price of the city, 900 bars were traded at a price five pence lower than the US parity, worth over £2.5 million. This is unprecedented in previous records. Hoarders were extremely panicked and rushed to sell their gold. The authorities had no choice but to absorb as much as possible again. After the closing price, there were still many who depreciated and sought to sell. The US price even reached seven and a half pence, but those who usually engaged in arbitrage trading with the US were unwilling to buy it, because this kind of transaction has obviously been affected by general panic. This has caused a lot of criticism, because this policy not only fails to quell the panic, but also increases the disturbance caused by rumors that the British and Americans are holding negotiations. In fact, British-American negotiations are only exploratory in nature. London insiders firmly believe that they are not going smoothly at present. Some parties expressed the opinion that the authorities' refusal to raise the gold price to be close to the US parity is nothing more than an attempt to entice merchants with great profits to buy in London and arbitrage out in New York. If this guess is true, then this policy has completely failed, because gold is now pouring into the market, endlessly. Those who engage in arbitrage are inevitably horrified and step back in the face of this huge amount of gold. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)

### The Incident of the Heavenly Law Sacred Farm

Japanese Purchase Land and Forcibly Establish Agricultural Institutions; Buildings Suddenly Burned Down, Leading to Negotiations; Traitorous Citizen Gu Enfu Released, Case Eases

Tianjin Correspondence: This spring, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, using the China Cultural Affairs Fund, planned to establish two institutions in Tianjin to study agricultural improvement and cotton production, as tools for developing rural areas in Hebei and Chahar provinces. One is named "North China Industrial Science Research Institute," with annual funding set at 170,000 yuan. The director, Terada, is hired by Mantetsu and attached to the Tianjin Sino-Japanese Middle School. It is currently under preparation and has not officially started work. The other is named "Sacred Farm," with annual funding of 130,000 yuan. The host, Eizo Shimada, began preparations in March of this year, purchasing 400 mu of land in Louzhuangzi, under the jurisdiction of Hai Xia Tianjin County. It is planned to employ 50 to 100 Japanese, Korean, and Chinese people to specialize in the cultivation of rice, fruits, cotton, and other products. Japanese experts will provide guidance separately so that each person can obtain rich agricultural training. When promoting to various counties in Hebei and Chahar, they will be sent to serve as guidance workers. As for the purchased land, the perpetual lease method used by various yarn factories in Tianjin is adopted, but although the contract is perpetual lease, the funds are paid annually. The person who buys the land under a false name and runs errands is the traitorous citizen of Louzhuangzi, Gu Enfu. The rent for the 400 mu of land is only 900 yuan per year. Before the land deed was signed, Shimada Eizo supervised the craftsmen to build a warehouse and three dormitories in the land. In early April, the Tianjin Municipal Government learned of this matter and sent personnel to the Japanese consulate to negotiate (since last winter, Tianjin County has been directly under the jurisdiction of Tianjin City). He was advised to stop the plan and told that there are many bandits in the area in the spring and summer. If the protection is not adequate, accidents will occur. However, this reason could not dispel the Japanese plan at all. Instead, it replied to the municipal government that the Japanese were not afraid of bandits. If there is danger, you can ask the police or the army to come and station. Afterwards, although the municipal government planned to supplement some reasons to prevent the implementation of the Japanese plan, the Japanese side greatly promoted that the Tianjin municipal government maliciously rejected Japan and opposed economic cooperation. The municipal authorities, intimidated by the mighty power, adopted a principle of doing nothing is better than doing more and did not mention this matter again. Last month, land sales cases were discovered in Hebei and Chahar. Based on the central government's inquiry, Song Zheyuan strictly ordered the Tianjin municipal and county governments to pay attention. If there are criminals who sell land, they can be executed after interrogation. At the same time, Song issued a severe bulletin in the name of the Director of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Appeasement Office. After receiving the order, the municipal and county governments followed it and dared not slacken. At this time, land sales cases were discovered, and many civil servants and traitors were arrested and fled in fear of crime. In order to thoroughly investigate the truth about the sale of land in Tianjin county area, the Hebei Provincial Government of the Hebei Supervision Envoy Office sent Section Chief Yin Jingrang and Commissioner Zhang Ximing to Tianjin to investigate. They have not left Tianjin so far. The Tianjin County Government, under the strict supervision of the superiors, seriously handled the matter. The sale of land in Louzhuangzi to the Sacred Farm was also included in the investigation. On May 27, the traitorous citizen Gu Enfu was summoned and severely reprimanded, and instructed not to sign any contracts with the Japanese. The land that has been purchased or leased under a false name should immediately cancel the contract and return to the original owner. If he does not comply, he will be executed according to the order of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Appeasement Office. After Gu received the doctor's notice, he did not take it seriously and was determined to rely on external forces to proceed with all the procedures as before. On the 28th, the county government arrested Gu again and detained him. On the same day, Shimada Eizo, in the name of the Sacred Homeowner, visited Chen Zhongyue, the magistrate of Tianjin County, and requested that Gu be released. Japanese Vice Consul Nishida Nagayasu also went to visit County Magistrate Chen on the order of Consul General Horiuchi and protested Zhou Ri, strongly stating that the county government's move was hindering Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and deliberately rejecting and resisting Japan. He demanded that the behavior be stopped immediately. County Magistrate Chen replied that he was acting on the orders of his superiors and that he was not in a position to make any decisions. Nishida left dissatisfied. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs obtained this information and sent a telegram to Tianjin on the 29th to inquire about the truth. On the 30th, Horiuchi planned to order Goto, the technician of the Sacred Home, to lead more than a dozen Chinese workers to forcibly cultivate the determined garden land. Goto and his party passed through Heizhongcheng Village and were persuaded to return by the county government police station. On the 1st of this month, Nishida again used this incident as a reason to visit County Magistrate Chen and reiterated his protest, saying that the county government police team insulted the Japanese and hindered legitimate cultivation, which must be stopped immediately, otherwise the Japanese would arm to protect the cultivation. If an incident similar to the Changchun Wanbaoshan incident on July 3, 1931 occurs, the county government should be held responsible. Chen County Magistrate believed that Nishida's wording was strong, so he telegraphed the province to report and asked the Tianjin Municipal Government for instructions. While in the process of handling it, at 1:10 am on the 2nd, the Japanese consulate suddenly notified the Tianjin County Government that more than a dozen Chinese people had set fire and burned the buildings of the Sacred Farm, a warehouse and three dormitories. At the same time, dozens of Japanese detectives were sent, carrying heavy trucks, to investigate. At about 8:00 am that morning, County Magistrate Chen also went to the park to examine the truth. The Japanese consulate sent Nishida and Japanese Police Chief Kōra to inspect and left Japanese detectives armed to guard the area and refused to retreat. Nishida returned to Tianjin at 10:00 am and, based on his one-sided evidence, visited Ma Yanchong, the secretary-general of the municipal government, and protested, saying that the entire park had been destroyed and the losses were incalculable. He immediately verbally expressed four points: ㊀ Immediately release Gu Enfu; ㊁ Be responsible for protecting the Japanese residents in Tianjin County and ban the anti-Japanese behavior of the people; ㊂ Protect the Sacred Farm; ㊃ The municipal government should assist the Japanese in thoroughly investigating the burning of the Sacred Farm to clarify the responsibility and reserve the right to claim damages. Ma agreed to forward it to Mayor Zhang Zizhong in Peiping for a reply. That night, Ma asked Zhang Zizhong for instructions by long-distance telephone, and then at about 6:00 am on the 3rd, he ordered Lu Nansheng, a councilor of the municipal government, and Bai Lun 𤩹, the chief of the police section of the Datsu County Government, to visit Japanese Consul Nishida to express his apology. The four requirements put forward by the Japanese side were accepted in principle and Gu Enfu was released on that day. The Japanese side was satisfied and the situation was eased. Zhang Muzhong was scheduled to return to Tianjin on the 4th to continue dealing with the unfinished ends of the case.

At 10 o'clock in the morning on the 3rd, Chen Zhongyue, the magistrate of Tianjin County, led Section Chief Bai Lun 𤩹 and others to the Sacred Farm to investigate again. The Japanese detectives stationed near the park actually prevented them from approaching. After repeated explanations, they were allowed to enter. The Japanese detectives on duty dug out a male corpse from the ashes, whose face was burned and rotten and could not be identified. However, the most suspicious thing is that although the corpse was just found from the ashes, it was not burned and convulsed. In the afternoon, a member of the court was sent to investigate, and after a cursory examination, it was buried. Now, Japanese Police Chief Hayashi, Tsuboi, and Naka, three people, lead more than a dozen patrol criminals and set up tents to station there, and there is no intention to withdraw. As for the Sacred Farm, there were originally 14 Japanese and 6 Chinese, and by the 2nd, it was verified by Shimada that they were all safe and sound. Therefore, the identity of the corpse found in the ashes is still a question. The Japanese claimed that the corpse was an arsonist who was burned to death after failing to escape after the fire. Our side, based on the research of the corpse's death, suspected that it was first killed and then thrown into the fire. Because we did not want to expand the problem and sought a quick solution, we did not argue about this point. There are two speculations about the burning of the Sacred Farm buildings: ㊀ The Japanese wanted to expand the negotiations, so they ordered Gu Enfu to set fire to create an excuse for anti-Japanese and facilitate the negotiations; ㊁ The farmers who sold the land, because Gu Enfu was detained, feared that they would be implicated and planned to terminate the contract, but because the Japanese had already built warehouses, it was inconvenient to directly graze the land. Stupid behavior, even set fire to burn it down. (Evening of the 3rd)

### Gleanings from Diancheng (22)

— Cup Volume

Forty-seventh day (May 21) Departed from Xingping. The river was rapid. In three hours, we arrived at Yangshuo County. We stopped the boat and landed at the foot of Jianshan Building to climb and photograph. The scenery along the way was vast. After returning, we will be able to make a film of the scenery of Guangxi and other provinces. According to the investigation, there are more than 700 cases of water routes of 20 kilometers from Xingping to Yangshuo, with no peak not strange, no mountain not empty (the result of the dissolution of sedimentary rocks). The best place to be Yangshuo is "Xiangsi River," that is, the situation near "Qing'e Ferry" mentioned in the previous letter. In the future, it may be changed to "Hongdou Ferry."

Monkeys are produced in Yangshuo Mountain, but there are not many recently. The people of Guilin scold the people of Yangshuo for being naughty as monkeys, so those who raise monkeys in Yangshuo also say that there are no monkeys for sale.

Around Yangshuo Park, there are the most grapefruit trees, producing dozens of loads a year. The taste is inferior to Shatin.

Take the provincial car and travel 44 kilometers on the highway to Liangfeng Park, which is the backyard of the high school school. There is a cave on the hillside and a red bean tree at the foot of the mountain, more than ten feet high. It is a parallel branch plant, with no broken branches and leaves. Nearby farmers sell red beans for four cents each. There are more purchases among colleagues, and the supply is less than the demand, so it is impossible to check again. (The red beans here are smaller than those in southern Anhui and more tender than those produced in Changshu. They do not seem to be rare products.)

At 3 pm, travel 20 kilometers from Liangfeng to Guilin. At the Provincial Government, we held a consultation meeting. The points inquired by each person and the answers given by the responsible persons are roughly the same as the indicators recorded in the "Guangxi Yearbook" and "General Situation of Guangxi." I will not repeat them.

In the evening, various legal groups of the Provincial Party Department were publicly invited to Lequn Society, and there was also Guiju. The tune is similar to Hanc腔, the narration is similar to Xiang 吻, the workmanship is still fine, and the rhyme is not smooth.

We have spent more time in Guangxi and Guizhou, and our shoes and socks are all worn out after arriving in Liuzhou and Guilin. The casual shoes purchased in the market are square-toed and have straps, like women's shoes in the Yangtze River. If you take them home, I am afraid that the person in bed will ask about their source. Laughter.

Guilin cuisine, civet cats and turtles have not been eaten, but salamanders are listed before shark fins and swallow's nests. Today's lunch at Liangfeng Park had "Pumpkin Tendril Prefecture Soup," which was especially unique.

The uniforms of civil servants throughout Guangxi Province, from elementary school students to the chairman of the province, are all gray Zhongshan suits (the cloth woven in the province), with only a different symbol on the left chest, even female students are the same, only the long hair is draped under the military hat.

The Political Training Office of Guangxi Province is the hub for promoting mass training. It employs a lot of people, with more than 600 people in the province and 60 to 70 people in Guilin.

The army of Guangxi fears and loves the people. It is very kind in the city and in the countryside. It is not like the people of other provinces who fear the appearance of soldiers. This is a good phenomenon.

Forty-eighth day (May 22) In the morning, we departed from Guilin and traveled 20 kilometers to a Gantang ferry. It was raining. The wheels slipped into the boat seam at the ferry. It took an hour to repair. The river surface of the ferry is 200 meters wide and the water is not very deep. After more than ten kilometers, we arrived at Yichuan. The overseas Chinese have already been washed away by the water and are also passing through by ferry. After another 40 kilometers, we passed Lingchuan County to a "Dada Rongjiang." The ferry is about 100 meters wide. After another 20 kilometers, we arrived at Xing'an County. Xing'an is near the origin of the Xiang and Li Rivers. There is a stone engraved with the words "Ling Canal". 300 steps in front of it, there is Fubo Temple, and in front of it is a water diversion pond.

Zhu Juanjuan spewed out and flowed south into Guibei and flowed north into Hunan. Tourists often stayed here to take a look. After passing Xing'an for 60 kilometers, we arrived at Quan County, and then 25 kilometers to Huangsha River, the upper reaches of the Xiang River. Our car arrived at the station just as it was raining heavily and we couldn't see anyone on the opposite side. Everyone got out of the car, and the car moved forward and fell into a small stream. I had no choice but to unload the luggage and take the Guilu spare car to travel. The original car was set up separately and repaired. A ferry is half a mile from Huangshahe Station. The river surface is more than 100 meters wide. Zaomupu Town is eight kilometers from Huangshahe, which is the boundary between Guizhou and Hunan. There is a stele that records it very clearly. After walking 40 kilometers to Dongxiang Bridge, the bridge surface is covered with tiles and cannot be driven. There is a ferry next to it. Because the river surface is 200 meters wide, it is pulled by a steamship. We saw pine trees planted all over the mountains in Guizhou, and tea (tea oil instead of tea leaves) planted all over the mountains in Hunan. There is still a lot of wasteland in Guizhou, and very little wasteland in Hunan. The population density of the countryside in Hunan is also denser than that in Guizhou, but the village rule and village system in Guizhou are consistent, and Hunan is inferior. There are a total of six ferries within 200 miles of the border between Hunan and Guizhou. It seems that neither province is ready to build bridges on the spot. Therefore, the joint transportation between provinces still needs to be negotiated in the future. In the evening, we arrived at Linglu County and used the 7th District Security Command as a reception center. People from all walks of life competed to win and agreed to a group of Yao people, both men and women, to sing and dance skillfully and play the leather drum. The Yao women wear a flat crown, which is four feet square. The wrapping is made of cowhide, and three sides are covered with tassels of beads. More than 30 silver flowers are attached to the top. Its leather drum has a large head like a trumpet shape, and the drum surface is made of frog skin. One head is as thin as a monkey knife handle, and it is struck with fingers to make a Dong Dong sound. There are also small nets and small cymbals, which are played in harmony with the drum. The board eyes are clear and the movements are fast and neat. It is said that Yao dance is better than Miao dance. There are also four Hunan operas.

On the forty-ninth day (May 22), in the morning, we first went to Lingling Zhishan Park. The park is on the top of the mountain. There is the Martyrs Shrine and the Martyr Tang Ling Stele Pavilion. From a pavilion on the top of the mountain, you can overlook the entire city of Lingling and the scenery along the river. After leaving the park, we set off for 50 kilometers to the opposite bank of Qiyang. First enter the "Yanyan Temple," which was built to commemorate Yuan Cishan Yan Zhen 𨜮. The "Great Tang Zhongxing Song" handed down from the world is on the riverside. There is a Wu Dacheng stele at the entrance, and there are many ancient inscriptions beside the mountain. Then we crossed the Xiao River again, and after three kilometers we arrived at Qiyang County. Qiyang is a prosperous hometown in southern Hunan, and the family system is particularly developed. Beizheng Street and Zhongshi Street in the city are very large ancestral halls, some attached to middle school scholars and some attached to commercial firms. We had lunch at Zhou Jia's Ci Hall, and there was also Hunan opera. The actor was Xiao Yumei, a famous Hunan Gui Kunjiao. She had already sung a play in Lingling last night. Qiyang sent a special car to pick her up here this morning. When Xiao Ling arrived in the territory, she had not arrived at 8 o'clock, and more than 5,000 military and political circles team students lined up along the way to welcome her, thinking that the tour group had arrived. In fact, it was raining heavily, and the group did not arrive until 11 o'clock, causing the crowd to stand for four hours. It was really unjust and in vain. In the afternoon, we traveled 20 kilometers to Shatan River. The ferry is only more than 100 meters wide. Then we passed through Guanshanping, Hongqiao, Quanhuh, and Sitang, four towns, and arrived in Hengyang.

### Japanese in Qingdao Stabbed Police Officer

The Reason Was That the Japanese Smuggled Copper Coins and Was Intercepted; Police Officer Yuan Xinting Suffered Five Knife Wounds; The Japanese Was Arrested and Taken Away by the Japanese Consul

Qingdao Correspondence: The Dagang and Xiaogang wharves in Qingdao are the hub of water and land transportation. Recently, Japanese people have repeatedly smuggled copper coins into the mountains. The police bureau took this into consideration and ordered them to strictly investigate those who smuggle copper coins. At about 10:00 pm on the 1st of this month, six Japanese people each rode a bicycle with a large number of copper coins tied behind the car and flew from Xiaogang 2nd Road to the wharf. Wang Chunfang, the police officer on duty there, saw that they were suspicious and immediately stepped forward to intercept them. The Japanese ignored him and continued to move forward. Police Officer Wang Chunfang chased after them while blowing his whistle to raise the alarm. Three retired police officers, Yuan Xinting, Guo Yi, and Sun Changyin, heard the sound and rushed to help chase. When they chased to Huimin Road, a Japanese man suddenly came with a sharp blade and stabbed Yuan Xinting in the cheek. At that time, the hail police fainted on the ground and did not know anything. The Japanese still thought it was not enough and stabbed Yuan Jing four more times, including one knife on his leg and three knives on his left and right wrists. The injury was extremely serious. The remaining police officers Wang Chunfang and others intended to go forward to rescue him. The Japanese man held a knife and stabbed Sun Changyin and Guo Yi. Fortunately, Sun Guo had precautions in advance. Although they were not stabbed in the vital parts, they were slightly injured. As a result, only one Japanese was captured, along with 3,809 copper coins and one bicycle. The remaining Japanese people took the opportunity to run away. The Japanese man was taken back to the Haixi District Police Sub-bureau. The sub-bureau telegraphed the Japanese consulate and took the Japanese man to interrogate him. The internal organs were transferred to the head office for confiscation. The injured police officer Xinting has been carried to the Hubei Road Qiangchu Hospital for treatment, and the wound has been sutured. There may be no danger to his life.

### Suzhou

Silk Cocoon Selling Boat Robbed Midway

Yesterday afternoon, villagers Zhou Yu 𨜮 and others from Suxiang Hengjing, Dongshan between Taihu Lake, were robbed by a bandit boat carrying five or six bandits with weapons when they were selling fresh cocoons to Dongshan. They were robbed of more than 100 yuan for cocoons and pushed the boatman He Awu into the water and fled. He was familiar with water and did not drown.

### Jiangyin

Situation After the Opening of the Silk Cocoon Market

This year's spring silk cocoon market was decided by the industry association to open on the 1st. There are still few goods on the Southeast Road, because there is an early and late relationship. The highest price has reached 50 yuan. The villagers are still waiting and seeing. There will be no surge in the next one or two days.

### Wuxi

Training of Baolongs in Eight Counties

The training of Baolongs in the eight counties under the jurisdiction of the Second District has been decided by Commissioner Shi Kuiling to start on July 1. The location has been selected in Suzhou. A total of 10,400 Baolongs from the eight counties will be trained in five phases. All the precautions that should be taken by the counties during the Baolong training have been ordered by the special department to the counties for compliance.

### Yangzhou

Northwest Township Wheat Harvest Greatly Reduced

The northwest township area under the jurisdiction of this county has always been known for its poverty. Coupled with years of famine, the people were already struggling to survive. Unexpectedly, heavy rain and snow fell repeatedly in the spring, causing most of the sown wheat seeds to rot in the soil. Even those with wheat ears could not bear fruit, resulting in a greatly reduced harvest. Farmers are all complaining bitterly.

### Zhenjiang

Excellent Silkworm Production Results

This year, Jiangsu Province has had a bumper harvest of mulberry leaves. The spring cocoons have all been placed on frames. Each silkworm egg sheet can produce about 20 catties of cocoons. Recently, cocoon prices have soared, with each dan (unit of weight) exceeding 40 yuan, the highest in the past five years. The Sericulture Management Committee is preparing to start hatching autumn silkworms. It was previously reported that Zhejiang Province had opened up a policy of self-sufficiency in local silkworm egg varieties. This committee has specifically restricted the expansion of various fields to avoid surpluses. It is now learned that Zhejiang Province's local varieties have not yielded well and has ordered 70,000 sheets of improved varieties from Jiangsu Province. It is also said that they plan to purchase another 600,000 sheets. Panic among the fields in Jiangsu Province has decreased.

### Hefei

Wheat Bumper Harvest Market Price

The counties of Hefei, Chaoxian, Lujiang, Shucheng, Wuwei, Hanshan, and Quanjiao in central Anhui Province have all reported bumper wheat harvests, but barley is slightly inferior. Wheat in Hefei has only been on the market for nearly a week. In the past few days, the market price was six yuan per shi (unit of volume). Recently, with convenient transportation, flour companies from Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai have successively sent people to purchase in large quantities. They have also set up branches along the Huainan Railway line in areas such as Xiatangji, Zhujiaxiang, Luoji, Cuozhen, and Qiaotouji, purchasing several thousand shi or more daily. Therefore, the wheat market price on June 2nd has risen to six yuan six or seven jiao per shi. Due to supply falling short of demand, there is still a tendency for it to continue to rise, which is significantly higher than the wheat market prices in previous years.

### Yancheng

Judgment on Land Purchase Lawsuit

Wu Bingzhou, a local resident, purchased 30 mu (unit of area) of land from Ni Yulin in the spring of the 24th year [of the Republic]. At that time, the land was mortgaged to Pan Shufen, and Wu deducted the price to redeem it. Unexpectedly, Wu suddenly fell ill and died. Pan then forcibly refused to allow redemption and colluded with the Ni family to establish another sales contract, attempting to permanently own the land. Wu's wife, Li, and his son, Wu Jia, had no choice but to sue the county government. The judgment ordered Pan to accept the redemption price and release the land. However, Pan refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Qingjiangpu Jiangsu High Branch Court. The president of the court, Sheng Shibi, and judges Han Jingdou and Chen Xianwen, held a joint trial and pronounced the judgment yesterday. Wu Li's attorney, Ying Hongye, received a telegram from Qingjiangpu stating that Pan Shufen's appeal had been rejected and that the appellant would bear the litigation costs. This long-standing property dispute case can now be considered concluded.

### Shaoxing

Building a Dam to Reclaim Land at Hejia Pond

Regarding the case of building a dam to reclaim land at Hejia Pond in Shaoxing, the Land Administration Office has already completed the topographic map. The Fifth Section is planning the land reclamation methods. The total area of the pond is 374,742 mu. It is proposed to build a dam to reclaim 152,688 mu, requiring a dam of 6,095 meters in length and an estimated cost of 32,000 yuan. Currently, it is unknown whether the mud at the bottom of the lake is suitable for planting. Therefore, soil samples will be taken for testing to determine whether this plan should be adopted.

### Ningbo

Manager Embezzles Funds and Flees

Hu Xingfu, the manager of the Xintai Lai Southern Lending House in Fenghua Daqiao, successively borrowed public funds from the store due to friends borrowing from the store, amounting to a huge sum of 5,000 yuan for speculative business in Ningbo that failed without returning. Recently, the friends avoided him, and Hu, fearing that the shareholders would discover and investigate, also absconded with more than 3,000 yuan of store funds, disappearing without a trace.

### Youth Association Holds Strength-Building Movement, Opening Ceremony Yesterday

City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai Delivered a Speech; Acting Mayor Yu and Others Invited to Speak in Rotation Daily

The Strength-Building Movement Exhibition initiated by the Chinese Christian Youth Association held its opening ceremony at the Association in Baxianqiao at 6:00 PM yesterday. City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered the opening speech and invited Acting Mayor Yu to speak on "Strength-Building Movement and National Revival." In addition to the exhibition of various designs on the first floor of the Association, divided into four categories: physical strength, intellectual strength, material strength, and mental strength, and various performances, famous figures in Shanghai will be hired to give speeches every evening from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Details are recorded below.

Chairman's Speech

The venue was on the third floor of the Association, with more than 500 attendees. First, the Association's director, Lu Ganchen, reported on the preparations. Then, Wang Xiaolai delivered the opening speech, saying that Shanghai's Youth Association has been developing the Strength-Building Movement, and he was publicly elected as chairman. Today's meeting is to contribute some humble thoughts to everyone. Today, in the world, there are large and strong countries, countries that are small in land area but very strong in national power, and countries that are large in land area but very weak in national power. Our country's current situation is the third type mentioned above, a so-called large and weak country. But frankly speaking, this situation should not exist. The entire strength of a country is latent in every member of the population. In a country with vast territory and a large population, the strength latent in each member of the population is strong, and the strength it emits must be great. In terms of productivity and defense capabilities, if Country A has a large land area and a large population, and Country B has a small land area and a small population, then Country A's productivity and defense capabilities must be higher than Country B's. Therefore, the size of a country's land and the size of its population should be directly proportional to the strength of its national power. When it cannot be directly proportional and turns into an inverse proportion, there are generally two reasons: ㊀ The inability to concentrate the entire strength of the country, which is the common ailment of the past so-called separatist state and feudal consciousness. ㊁ For example, the self-destruction of past warlords, using the entire strength of the country for unnecessary consumption. Considering the current situation of our country from now on, the foundation of unity has been laid, and the authority of the central government has been established. There is no need to worry about further dispersing or wasting national power. But there is one crucial point that should be recognized: the entire strength of the country is latent in every member of the population. If used well, the latent strength can be expressed and promoted. If not used well, the latent strength can be wasted and turned into nothing. If a country is to have strength, its people must first have strength. As Han Feizi said, "A million foolish people are as good as no people," which is what he meant. Our country, with 490 million people, cannot keep up with the strength of Japan's 60 million people (referring to the Japanese mainland), and the key lies in this point. Therefore, we should not first be pleased that the country is unified and national power is concentrated, thinking that any difficulties can be dealt with in the future. We should also pay attention to the latent strength in each member of the population. Can it be expressed? Can it be promoted? To express and promote their individual strengths, we must use education and saving methods to ensure that their good strengths are not buried or wasted. Then, the strength of 450 million people can be transformed into the entire strength of the country, naturally able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the world's great powers.

Exhibition Situation

The decorations are very solemn. A horizontal plaque with the words "Strength-Building Movement" is hung above the hall on the first floor. On both sides are couplets: "Dig the well when thirsty, prevent trouble before it happens." Portraits of famous figures from past dynasties, such as Shi Kefa, Ban Chao, Sun Yat-sen, Mencius, Zhuge Liang, Zhu Xi, Xu Guangqi, Wen Tianxiang, Wang Anshi, Confucius, and Yue Fei, are hung on the left and right, a dazzling array with great significance. The internal exhibition is divided into four parts: mental strength, intellectual strength, material strength, and physical strength. Pictures and texts are hung everywhere, all very alerting. The exhibition dates are from the opening day yesterday to the 14th. Each day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM is for public viewing.

Daily Lectures

The general topic is "Building Strength to Defend the Country." June 4th: Strength-Building Movement and National Revival, Yu Hongjun. 5th: How Should the Chinese People Build Strength? Pan Gongzhan. 6th: Historical Observation of the Strength-Building Movement, Chen Gaoyong. 7th: Comparison of National Strengths in the World, Fan Zhongyun. 8th: Strength-Building Movement and Spiritual Revolution, Chen Wenyuan. 9th: Strength-Building Movement and National Construction. 10th: Strength-Building Movement and the Mission of Youth, Jiang Wenyu. Time: 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM daily. Location: Assembly Hall of the Youth Association in Baxianqiao. Broadcasting: Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications, frequency 1300.

### Textile Industry Developing Towards the Interior

Impact of Japanese Expansion; Plans in Zhejiang, Henan, and Other Provinces

Due to the large-scale expansion of the Japanese side, China's textile industry has a trend of developing towards the interior, hoping to achieve self-sufficiency in various places. Zhejiang Province currently has a plan to establish a large-scale textile factory with 300,000 spindles. The provincial authorities are contacting the financial community for investment. It is heard that the provincial government has not yet raised enough funds, and the joint venture plan is difficult to determine. Henan Province also plans to establish a factory with equipment of 110,000 spindles and is currently in negotiation. In addition, a medium-sized yarn factory has been decided in Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, with a total of 50,000 spindles. The machinery has been ordered, and the factory in Henan Province is currently under construction. The rest will be able to start work soon. It is heard that after the China Cotton Corporation increased its capital, various banks have joined in the share capital.

After being detected by various parties, they urgently telegraphed the central ministries to quickly issue a strict order to stop it in order to protect national sovereignty. After receiving the telegram, the central government handed it over to the Ministry of Industry for verification.

### Shanghai Telephone Bureau Develops Urban Traffic, Expands User Lines by 2,000 Numbers

Adds Seats to North and South City Zero and Public Platforms; Adds Relay Lines and Purchases 300 New Machines in the Chinese Concession

In order to develop urban traffic, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has specifically planned to expand user lines, order new machines, add relay lines and cables to the Chinese concession, and add seats to the Zero platform and public telephone platforms. It has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and is being carried out in phases. The construction project is scheduled to be completed before the end of this year. The details are recorded as follows:

Expansion of Zero Public Telephone Platform

The Shanghai Telephone Bureau originally had a Zero telephone platform in the Chinese Concession for receiving calls, with two in Zhabei, eight in Nanshi, two public platforms in Nanshi, and one in Beishi. In recent years, after the bureau painstakingly planned and engaged in construction of urban traffic facilities, the number of users has increased sharply, and the long-distance telephone network has been gradually completed, making the number of incoming and outgoing calls very heavy. Therefore, the original Zero platform has felt insufficient. Therefore, it is planned to increase six seats in addition to the original two seats in Zhabei, increase ten seats in addition to the original eight seats in Nanshi, and increase two seats in addition to the original one public telephone platform in Zhabei, and increase three seats in addition to the original two seats in Nanshi.

Increase Relay Lines to Facilitate Calls

The number of relay lines connected by the Chinese Concession has gradually increased to sixty pairs since the city area was converted to automatic telephone exchanges. Now, not only has the number of users in the city area increased sharply, but also nearby areas such as Shanghai County have requested the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to take over, resulting in the original relay lines being insufficient for calling and connecting. In order to facilitate user calls, the bureau has specifically laid another sixty pairs for use in the Zero and public telephone platforms. In the future, calls will not be crowded and interrupted. The relay cable from Zhabei to the city center is being expanded at the same time because the city center is gradually becoming prosperous, and the relay line distribution is difficult. The bureau has also prepared all the application materials and started construction.

Order New Machines and Lay User Lines

In order to expand its business and make urban traffic construction complete, the bureau has submitted a report to the Ministry of Communications to order two of the latest type of telephone exchanges from the German Siemens factory. At the same time, in addition to the original number of lines, it will lay another 2,000 user lines in the North and South cities and various districts so that stores, factories, and residents in the city area can report their installation at any time. It is estimated that the entire project can be completed by the end of this year.

### Japanese Marines Busy Practicing Street Fighting

Nearby Residents Greatly Alarmed

Nearby residents have been greatly alarmed. According to the reporter of the Dagong News Agency, around 9:30 PM the night before last, more than 30 Japanese marines, fully armed, practiced street fighting in the Beisichuan Road Baole'an Road Fenge Lane area. They divided into two groups and made a gesture of surrounding the Japanese military headquarters. There were also weapons such as hand-held machine guns participating in the exercise. At one time, the Japanese army was lurking in the dim light of Baole'an Road and Fenge Lane, crawling along the eaves and advancing towards the Japanese military headquarters. The situation was very tense. It was not until around 10:30 PM that the officers sounded their whistles to return to the camp.

### Changxing Postal Ship Trials Berthing at the Qiujiang Pier

Preparation for Transporting Cars

The Shanghai Times reported that when the Japanese Empress ship of Changxing Company arrives in Shanghai on the 13th of this month, it will try to berth at the newly built pier on Qiujiang Road. All arrangements have now been completed. It is heard that the port authority has signed a contract with a certain car dealership, and the rental fee for each car from the pier to the Public Concession is one yuan or one yuan and five jiao, so that passengers can take it to travel. Those who take a car south to Edward Road or west to Yuqiaqing Road pay one yuan; those who exceed this boundary pay one yuan and five jiao. Luggage is carried by several moving companies, and there are also regulations on the fees. According to an expert from the local shipping industry, berthing at the Qiujiang Road pier is not very difficult in terms of cargo. In addition to the pier being built from a storage yard, all kinds of goods can be sent to warehouses in the concession by heavy trucks and barges. One of the greatest conveniences is that each ship can moor at the pier one hour earlier, and passengers who want to disembark and sightsee will have no difficulties and can sightsee for one more hour. There is a customs inspection office, passenger waiting room, travel agency office, inquiry office, and stores built on the pier. Friends who want to pick up passengers at the pier in advance can avoid the many inconveniences of the past. Those who have their own cars and want to go to the pier can go directly from Yangshupu Road via Jungong Road, or take Beisichuan Road via Jiangwan Road or Qimei Road to the area.

### Zhabei Households Gradually Increase

Prosperity in the Yongxing Road Area

Since the Xuan Sheng case occurred last winter, the Japanese army has set up sentry posts and patrolled and frequently conducted exercises in the area where North Sichuan Road crosses the border and is built, causing the citizens of Zhabei, who had just barely recovered, to be frightened and move away. Therefore, the number of households in Zhabei decreased in November of last year. This year, the situation has stabilized, and the municipal government has spared no effort in revitalizing the Zhabei market, so the population has recently increased again. According to the statistics of the Yongxing Road police station, the number of households was only 9,781 in November of last year, with a population of 50,271 men and women. In the recent two months, more residents have moved in. In April, the number of households reached 11,241, with a population of 56,507 men and women. In May, it increased again to 11,718 households, with a population of 56,812 men and women. This is also evidence of the increasing prosperity of Zhabei.

### The Yangtze River Rises and the Hankou Water Level Exceeds 30 Feet

The Dikes Along the River Gradually Show Signs of Danger?? Customs Warns About Navigation Facilities The Work of the Surveying Office Suddenly Intensifies

The Yangtze River's peach blossom flood level this year is difficult to predict as it rises and falls abruptly. Yesterday afternoon, according to the Datong News Agency reporter's investigation with the Shanghai Maritime Customs Engineering Office, the Hankou water level suddenly rose sharply by more than ten feet, gradually showing dangerous signs. The situation is urgently recorded as follows:

The River Water Rises Suddenly, and the Situation Is Serious

The highest water level of the Yangtze River this year reached more than 24 feet, and then fell to about 19 feet. However, yesterday the Maritime Affairs Department of the Customs received a report from the Hankou Customs that the water level there had risen to 30 feet and 0.2 inches. At the same time, the Jiujiang water level also increased sharply, rising to 29 feet and 9 inches, which is an increase of more than ten feet compared to the water level a few days ago. The Wuhu water level was reported yesterday to be 19 feet and 6 inches. It is expected that as the floodwaters flow downstream, the water level will continue to increase. The counties along the river are gradually showing signs of danger, and it seems necessary to urgently inspect the embankment and riverbank.

The Customs Engineering Office Issued a Warning Yesterday

As the river water suddenly rose, the work of the surveying office under the Customs Engineering Office also suddenly became busy, because the previous navigation facilities had to be changed one by one, and the charts had to be revised to facilitate navigation. The reporter will now record the marine warning announcement issued by Tali, the temporary acting director of the Patrol Engineering Office, yesterday: The Jiujiang section of the Maritime Affairs Department telegraphed on the 1st of this month (whether it is accurate or not must be confirmed): Case: After checking the Yangtze River downstream navigation notice No. 2922 and No. 923, the Huoyanshan Honggaopo channel lightship has been withdrawn from the 2nd of this month, and the Xinzhou Bantan lightship will be set up. Also, the navigation rules for the Huoyanshan Honggaopo channel will be abolished.

### The County Actively Dredges Rivers, and Water Will Be Released Uniformly Tomorrow

The dredging of various rivers in Shanghai County this year has been delayed due to missed work on the levee. Although there have been many sunny days recently, farmers are busy with farming, and those who go out to work are not yet enthusiastic. The county government, in view of the urgent need for water by farmers, has temporarily approved the Hengli, Danshui, Jiaomen, Sanyang, and Liuqu rivers to open their dams and release water tomorrow (the 6th). Before opening the dams, they should still actively urge the work to be done. The Wu and Zhang district chiefs of the first and third districts have been commanding on the river banks for days, and the porters have also been more excited, and it is expected that the river projects will not be far from the standard.

### Workers from the Jingwei Factory Go to Beijing to Petition and Are Persuaded to Return by the Municipal Police Bureau

The Meiya No. 5 Factory Is Temporarily Suspended Due to a Shortage of Raw Materials The No. 6 and No. 7 Factories Continue to Work as Usual

The workers of the Meiya Jingwei Factory on Rihui East Road, Zhaonan, unable to make a living because the management has delayed the start of work, were forced to form a petition group and a propaganda team yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM and set off separately. Upon learning of this, the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau immediately sent bureau member Zhang Huantang, together with the patrol officer of the Rihui Bridge Police Station, to lead the police to persuade them to return to the general factory's workshop and instructed them to wait quietly for the Party and government agencies to resolve the matter in accordance with the law. In addition to the Meiya No. 5 Factory at No. 679 Xietu Road, which was temporarily suspended due to a shortage of warp and weft raw materials, the other No. 6, No. 7, and No. 9 factories are still working as usual. However, if the Jingwei Factory does not start work immediately, the various factories will also be suspended one after another when there is a shortage of warp and weft.

### The Chinese Cigarette Factory Association Sends a Letter Requesting Exemption from the Ban on Gifts

The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association previously received instructions from the Taxation Administration, which were transferred from the Ministry of Finance, to prohibit cigarette gifts. The association, considering that this matter was related to the survival of the majority, convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members to discuss the matter together. It was resolved to send a letter to the Taxation Administration to be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, requesting it to consider the difficulties of the business community, withdraw the order, and exempt it from the prohibition. It is now heard that the association yesterday sent a letter to the Taxation Administration, which read as follows: "We have received your letter forwarding the Ministry of Finance's order No. 37465, Tax Department, dated May 25, 1937, which stated that the four measures previously set by the Ministry for cigarette empty shells, cores, booklets, switching of cigarettes of this brand, and other daily-use domestic goods and ordinary daily-use items were of a temporary and experimental nature. Since these measures have been implemented by various factories, they have existed in name only and have encouraged a侥倖 mentality in the society. They should be announced to be abolished immediately. Cigarettes with switching gifts that have already been produced by various factories will be given leniency and a deadline of three months to voluntarily withdraw them. If there are still switching gifts after the deadline, the Taxation Administration should investigate and immediately stop the sale and issue of licenses for the brands concerned in order to crack down on them. In addition to consulting the provincial and municipal governments for investigation and informing subordinates, it is hereby ordered that the bureau immediately transfer and instruct the district unified tax bureaus, tax bureau chiefs, and the factories concerned to comply with this order. This order has been transferred to the association, and it has been submitted to the 28th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for discussion. Since the tax increase this time, various cigarette factories have had extreme difficulties in their business. If our government is considering the future of industry and the income of national taxes, it should try to maintain them, how can it prohibit gifts again? Moreover, the gift measures have been implemented for many years. Later, the Ministry set four measures to show restrictions and prevent侥倖. Various factories have been able to comply with them, and there have been no transgressions. Even if there are a few managers who, because of slow cigarette sales, make slight changes, the taxation authorities' supervision and crackdown are quite strict, and it is easy to correct them. As for the sections presented by Pan Yaoheng and others, since they are not people in the cigarette factory and do not understand the inside story, the facts are often inaccurate and the words are inevitably excessive. Our government should not lightly believe the one-sided words of Pan and others and hastily order the prohibition of gifts. If the prohibition is actually implemented, it is no different from putting the various cigarette factories to death. Most cigarette factories only have one or two trademarks for sale, and most of them adopt the four gift measures set by the Ministry. If they are abolished once, the cigarettes with original gifts will be unsalable because of the prohibition of gifts. If new trademarks are issued, it will be difficult to promote them. I am afraid that most cigarette factories will inevitably go bankrupt as a result, and millions of workers will be unemployed. The situation is extremely dangerous. Whether there is a guarantee of tax revenue has nothing to do with gifts. Therefore, the various cigarette factories cannot agree with the Ministry's order to prohibit gifts. They only hope to continue to comply with the four gift measures set by the Ministry. If there are any transgressions, the taxation authorities can strictly crack down on them, and there is no need to worry that they cannot comply. We should ask the Taxation Administration to forward the matter to the Ministry of Finance to withdraw the order in order to relieve the difficulties of the business community and maintain business, and to appease the public. We are deeply grateful. This is addressed to the Ministry of Finance Taxation Administration, and the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association hereby initiates."

### The "Iron Lung Man" Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Departs for America Tomorrow Night

The "Iron Lung Man" Arrives in Shanghai Safely from Beiping; Doctors Predict He Can Recover His Health in Two Years; Two Chinese Female Nurses Will Accompany Him to America for Studies

Snlte, a British wealthy young man, now 26 years old, graduated from Bucknell University in Philadelphia, USA, with a master's degree in economics. Because his father had many businesses, he immediately assisted his father, Snlteford, in managing lending businesses in the United States. At the beginning of January last year, his father took a round-the-world trip, and of course, Snlte accompanied him. When they arrived in Tokyo, Japan, in mid-March, Snlte felt slightly unwell, but he was still able to continue the journey with difficulty. By the end of March, when they arrived in our country, his illness suddenly worsened. His whole body muscles suddenly became stiff, and his lung respiration changed from rapid to almost stopping. In this life-or-death moment, the Snlte family learned that Peking Union Medical College Hospital had the only iron lung equipment in the Far East, so they immediately flew from Shanghai to Beiping, asking Peking Union Medical College Hospital to use the iron lung to treat their beloved son. However, at that time, Mr. Snlte's intention was only to try it out. Unexpectedly, after being treated with the iron lung, he improved significantly. After fourteen months of diagnosis and treatment and the efforts of the doctors, he gradually regained the ability to eat, drink, and talk. However, except for his head, he still could not move, relying on the iron lung to prolong his life and unable to leave it. Last month, Mr. Snlte himself, because he had been sick for a long time and was a guest in a foreign country, inevitably felt homesick. Therefore, after discussions between Mr. Snlte's father and doctors, it was decided to return home. So, a special car was ordered from the railway bureau, preparations were made, nurses were hired, and everything else was prepared, which took half a month. Finally, on the 2nd of this month, they set off south. The journey was quite pleasant, but because the iron lung was still a Far Eastern novelty, it attracted many people to admire it. However, the security was tight, and at the same time, for the sake of the patient's health, most people were refused entry.

Special Train is Fully Equipped

Snlte's special train borrowed the blue steel car from the Jinpu Railway Bureau, including three baggage cars numbered 2511, 2714, and 2507, one first-class car numbered 561, one first-class dining car numbered 2055, and one first-class sleeping car numbered 206. Snlte and the iron lung were in baggage car number 2511. There were only a few unsuitable places inside the car, which were slightly modified. The front of the car was the engine room, with three small diesel engines and one hand-cranked small engine in case of emergency, which were the responsibility of four workers. The rear of the car was used to store Snlte's luggage and all the medical equipment needed. The middle was where the "Iron Lung Man" Snlte was sitting. The interior was exceptionally clean, and there were also one or two fresh flowers on the desk. Three Chinese female nurses in white coats and white hats, as well as Dr. Faulkner and Mr. Di Long from Peking Union Medical College Hospital, who were treating Snlte, were also there. However, everyone's mouth was covered with a mask to prevent any impure air from reaching the patient. After the train was prepared by the Jinpu Railway Bureau, it was sent to Beiping Station on May 30. However, due to insufficient preparation, it was not used until June 2, delaying the train for a total of 47 hours, and the car rental alone cost 8,419.80 national currency.

Curious People Gather at the Station

When the special train arrived at Beiping Station, in addition to the Chinese and foreign press who came to the station for work-related reasons to conduct interviews, the photographers also worked extra hard. Many outsiders, driven by curiosity, gave up their sweet dreams and ran to the station platform to visit. However, because the iron gates on the Beiping station platform were crisscrossed, making it inconvenient to enter and exit, after Mr. Snlte's family and servants got off the train, the special train was switched to the Wusong platform. The people who came with him were Mr. Snlte's father, Ford, wearing a light brown palmerino suit, white hat, and white shoes, with glasses on his nose, looking very energetic and amiable. He was very busy taking care of everything and answered questions from visitors in detail without any omissions. Snlte's mother was shorter, also wearing glasses, and wearing a black dress with white flowers. After getting off the train, she was helped out of the station by Snlte's sister, Mary, and Snlte's girlfriend, Miss Sayerfis, and two American female nurses. They took a China Travel Service car to the hotel to rest first. There were eight Chinese female nurses in total. In addition to the three who were on duty in the "Iron Lung Man" car, the other five also went to the China Travel Service Hotel. A Chinese masseur also accompanied them. The China Travel Service Hotel had booked twelve rooms on the fourth floor of the hotel in advance. It is said that six of these eight Chinese female nurses will return to China after arriving in Chicago, and the other two will study in the United States to pursue further education. All expenses will be borne by Mr. Snlte's father. As for the salary during their service period, it will all be paid by Mr. Snlte, and the treatment is very generous. It is said that what they earn in one day is equivalent to their original salary for one month.

The Patient Lies in a Green Cylinder

All the luggage was entrusted to the Shanghai Moving Company for transportation, totaling three cars. The car carrying the "Iron Lung Man" was provided by Moutai Foreign Company, a truck equipped with a steel mesh, with the concession license number 16610 and the city license number 13402. It drove into the Wusong platform at 5:00 am, close to the "Iron Lung Man" car door. At that time, the railway mechanic responsible for managing the electricity on the special train installed a small diesel engine on the truck, turned it on to full power, and connected it to the iron lung. At the same time, the nurses in the car moved the medical equipment into the truck. The nurses in the car covered the "Iron Lung Man's" head with white gauze. By 5:28 am, all the procedures for moving the iron lung were completed, and the car door was opened wide. The coolies from the Shanghai Moving Company and the people in the car slowly moved the "Iron Lung Man" out and into the truck. At this time, the crowd was挤动,争欲一睹鐵肺, but the iron lung was surrounded by doctors and nurses, and only a apple green circular bucket was visible, with the patient lying inside. The reporter, having occupied a good position in advance, was able to catch a glimpse. On top of the bucket-shaped iron lung, there was a thermometer, a活菓氣門 on the left and right, an electrical outlet at the foot, and a drawer-shaped excrement container at the buttocks. The head was completely exposed, with a rubber ring around the neck. Under the back was a bellows-style airbag made of yellow胶布, which was pushed up and down by the motor current, causing the airbag to expand and contract, moving the海棉估 wrapped around the human lungs, and helping with breathing. This is why the iron lung cannot be separated from electricity. In other words, the iron lung cannot stop working for even a minute or a second.

His Condition Was Good after Being Transferred to the Hospital

After all the electrical wires from the small motor on the truck were properly connected to the iron lung, the truck started moving and headed towards the Public Concession Hospital. It was 5:30 am, and the sky was bright. However, in order to minimize the vibrations, the car moved very slowly, from North Railway Station Road, east to Baoshan Road, North Henan Road, and then to North Suzhou River Road. Along the way, the Shanghai Municipal Police dispatched four车巡 West police officers to closely protect the truck. By the time it reached the gate of the Public Concession Hospital, it was 6:10 am. Then, the mechanic who managed the electrical machinery was busy again, first connecting hundreds of feet of electrical wires to the electrical outlets in Ward 5, and then extending them straight to the door and connecting them to the iron lung. At this time, the motor on the truck stopped, and all the power for driving the iron lung was supplied by the hospital. After all the procedures were completed, the "Iron Lung Man" was carefully moved down from the truck and pushed into the hospital, gradually reaching Ward 5. The task was finally completed, and the clock struck seven. Dr. Faulkner immediately examined him, and his condition was very good. The "Iron Lung Man" will return to America tonight on the Coolidge President Ship. The ship is scheduled to set sail tomorrow (Sunday). The China Travel Service has booked twelve first-class cabins. It is said that it will not stop at Honolulu and other ports and is expected to arrive in San Francisco in about 18 days. Then, he will transfer to a train and go directly to Chicago for treatment at a Chicago hospital. According to Dr. Faulkner, if the "Iron Lung Man" receives careful treatment in the United States for two years, he will definitely be able to restore his original health. Mr. Snlte's father, Ford, expressed his gratitude to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for their careful treatment of his beloved son. In addition to donating a new iron lung, he will remit another million national currency dollars from the United States as a fund for the hospital. In total, Snlteford spent more than 550,000 US dollars for his son's illness. The medical and equipment expenses in China alone amounted to 180,000 US dollars.

### First Accusing Her Husband of Indecent Assault, Then Suing for Abuse

She Asks for a Divorce and Living Expenses; Yesterday's Trial Concluded and a Date Was Set for the Verdict

Cheng Jielin, 30 years old, from Wu County, currently residing at No. 8 Qin Shen Li, Fang Xie Road, is a college student. His wife, Zhang Fuxuan, 30 years old, from Taicang, residing at No. 35 Si Xiang Li, Lafayette Road, is a graduate of Taicang Normal School. A pair of intellectuals, a modern couple, have been married for three and a half years. Unexpectedly, they are divorcing due to an indecency incident. Initially, Zhang accused Cheng of scratching her lower body, but after examination, there were no injuries. The prosecutor indicted Zhang for false accusation, and the criminal court ruled that Cheng was innocent. Therefore, Zhang filed a lawsuit in the local court, requesting divorce on the grounds of abuse. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Shao held a court hearing. The plaintiff, Zhang Fuxuan, stated that she had been abused by the defendant in various ways. In addition to requesting a divorce, she also requested a judgment for ten years of living expenses, totaling 3,600 yuan at 30 yuan per month, and 1,200 yuan for the children's education expenses. She also stated that on December 30 of last year, the defendant abandoned her for two months, disregarding her livelihood. On February 2, he sent someone to move away her belongings, etc. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that, according to the plaintiff, the defendant had some physical deficiencies, sometimes unable to consummate the marriage, and sometimes using illegal means to injure her lower body. At this point, the defendant, Cheng Jielin, stated that she had accused him of indecent assault in the prosecutor's office, but the case was not prosecuted, and he sued her for false accusation. She had been away for several months, had an affair, and fabricated facts to repeatedly accuse him in order to achieve the purpose of divorce. The two children were not raised by him but were adopted before and after the marriage. He fundamentally disagreed and let his mother-in-law raise them. He did not want a divorce. At this point, Feng Shaozhang, the former landlord, testified that the belongings were moved away by Cheng Jielin. At this point, the plaintiff presented a photo of the defendant with another woman, but the defendant stated that this was a girlfriend from a former dance troupe. The judge asked the defendant if their relationship was good.

### Post Office Messengers Voluntarily Ban New Year's Gift Giving

Yesterday, Messengers Distributed Notices to Inform All Sectors

The postal messengers and postal workers of this city's post office specially announced to all sectors yesterday that they would voluntarily declare the abolition of the old custom of giving New Year's gift giving and酒资 to implement a new life, and its announcement roughly stated that we postal workers serve the society, always adhering to the spirit of unselfishness and the indomitable will to seek welfare for the country and society, and taking it as our duty, which is truly worthy of self-satisfaction and without愧於職責. However, a few outsiders often automatically give酒资 on the eve of the废曆關節, to reward our hard work, loyalty, and accuracy of service. After thinking again and again, we think it is not so. We are entrusted by the country, that is, we are public servants of the country, and it is our duty to do our best for the country. For the sake of personal responsibility and for the sake of our personality, this move should be abolished, especially since the new life movement is in full swing. All public officials must set an example and advocate it first. Now that the废曆喘節 is approaching, we hereby solemnly announce to all sectors that our colleagues in this bureau voluntarily declare the abolition of the old custom and permanently eliminate bad rules. There is no need to酬劳 with酒资. If there are unscrupulous people who privately ask for cases from all sectors, please use the telephone or write to this bureau immediately. In addition to explaining and persuading them in detail, our colleagues in this bureau are willing to compensate all sectors for all the damages they have suffered as a result. We are very eager to do so.

And Retains the Right to Claim Damages

Chen Zhihou, a wealthy Chaozhou businessman who has been in Shanghai for decades, runs businesses such as Yufeng Grain Store, Yonghe Pawnshop, and Guangchang Japanese Goods Store. His son, Chen Huanzhen, is 18 years old this year. It turns out that, regrettably, he is a disabled deaf-mute. Chen Zhihou, in his deep affection for his son, actually married Zheng Xihua, a woman from his hometown (currently 20 years old, her mother's home is at No. 3 Jingming Li, Fuyou Road), for his son in 1935 when his son was not yet 16 years old. After Xihua passed through the door, she learned that her lifelong companion was a deaf, mute, short, and small person, burying her lifelong happiness. Therefore, in anger, she returned to her mother's home without returning after living together for only four months. Recently, Zheng Xihua hired lawyers Dai Ningrui and Yuan Yuean, etc., and, according to Article 980 and Article 989 of the Civil Code, which stipulate that illegal marriages can be revoked, requested the local court to approve the revocation of the marriage relationship and retained the right to claim damages based on the facts. Judge Cheng Weicheng presided over the trial several times, but the defendant never appeared and submitted a written statement, arguing that the jurisdiction was wrong and requesting that the matter be resolved in his hometown. After the plaintiff objected, the court continued the trial. Yesterday, it ordered Chen Zhihou to appear in court to testify. He is 49 years old, from Chaozhou, and lives at No. 8 Yong'an Xing, College Road, Shanghai City. The Yonghe Pawnshop is jointly owned and has been open for more than a year. The Guangchang Department Store is also jointly owned and has been open for a year. I opened Juchang Pawnshop in Chaozhou and Yiyuan Grain Store in Shantou. I go back and forth to Shanghai. As for the Shanghai Yufeng Grain Store, it has been open for more than ten years and is now closed. I still have five or six people, including my mother and wife, in my hometown, with a three-room two-进 house and small fields. My son and Zheng Xihua were married in Chaoyang. I did not go to host the wedding at that time. I go to Chaoyang once a year. I have another concubine and three children and three servants in Shanghai, a total of eight people. As for my son Huanzhen, he is now studying at a school for the deaf and mute. Xihua married my son on December 21 of the旧历 in 1935 and only lived with him for four months before returning to her mother's home and refusing to come back. The judge asked how many years the Yonghe pawnshop had been open, so how many years had you come to Shanghai? He answered also more than ten years, but going back and forth. The hair妻李氏 and Huanzhen were born to李氏, and李氏 had also come to Shanghai to live for six or seven years because Huanzhen was studying in Shanghai. As for the manager of Yonghe, he is named Xiao Hanchen. At this point, Zheng Xihua immediately said that the Shanghai Yufeng Grain Store had been open for more than 30 years, and he still has immovable property in Shanghai, such as Yonghe Pawnshop and Guangchang Store. As for the Chaozhou pawnshop he mentioned, it was not opened by him but by his fifth uncle. My father-in-law usually lived in Yufeng Grain Store, located on Minguo Road, and both I and the defendant grew up in Shanghai, etc. Then, lawyer Dai stated that Chen Zhihou claimed to have opened a Juchang Pawnshop in Chaozhou, and he should be ordered to submit the share certificate to show credibility. The judge then instructed Chen Zhihou to submit the share certificate and the evidence of the houses in his hometown within ten days as proof. Chen said that it would take at least 20 days. The plaintiff said that it could be done in only one week, so why delay? The judge then instructed that the order should still be carried out, and the court adjourned.

### Jiang Weiyu Detained for Allegedly Luring and Raping Under the Pretext of Marriage

Jiang Confesses He Was Liquidating His Business That Day and Had No Time for Such Jokes, Denying the Accusation; The Court Ordered the Case to Be Rescheduled for Further Hearing

Jiang Weiyu, 28, a minor owner of the Jiang Xiangxing slaughterhouse in Gonghe Road, Zhabei, is a young man who usually wears Western suits, with a refined demeanor. Moreover, he enjoys the benefits of his father's wealth. After his father passed away, he inherited a huge fortune, so he uses the most luxurious clothing. As a wealthy young man, he is naturally amorous. He has both a beautiful wife and a charming concubine, enjoying endless tenderness and spending limitless wealth. He is living an extremely comfortable life. Yet, he also frequents brothels.

Addicted to dancing halls, he squandered the huge fortune accumulated by his ancestors through hard work. He declared bankruptcy, and creditors surrounded him with lawsuits. He moved to Building Ye in Fuli Road, French Concession, number 51, as a high platform to avoid debt. He had previously been sued by creditors for issuing bad checks and punished. Misfortune never comes singly, and bad luck comes one after another. He was sued by Hu Didi (real name Hu Caizhen, 18, from Shaoxing), a Shanghai dance girl, through her mother, Hu Yu, as her legal representative, for the crime of undermining public morals. The complaint states that Hu Yu, 38, is a middle-aged woman. Her husband is in Japan, and she opened Yongshunchang Copper and Tin Hardware Store at number 831 Beijing Road, North Mud City Bridge, Public Concession. After her husband died, Hu Caizhen, following the trend, learned drama and dancing. With her exquisite skills, she went to the Shanghai dance halls and became quite famous for her embracing livelihood. Jiang had danced with her and unknowingly became infatuated. There was Gao Zigang, 31, who often associated with Jiang and was also a close friend of Hu Yu's husband. Jiang Weiyu had divorced his beloved wife and was infatuated with Caizhen, so he asked Gao to be the matchmaker, willing to bring her back with a hundred carriages. However, the Hu family thought that their daughter was in her prime, while Jiang was approaching thirty. Due to the age difference, they expressed their unwillingness. Jiang then asked Gao to go with him to the Hu family to kneel down and propose, vowing to take care of her. Seeing his sincerity and attracted by his wealth, the Hu family immediately agreed. This was at the beginning of July last year. Jiang chose the auspicious day of July 11th to hold an engagement ceremony at the Dajiali Restaurant. However, on July 18th, Jiang lured Hu Caizhen to the Yangzi Hotel and spent two nights with her until the 20th, when she returned. Naturally, Hu Yu learned about this. Thinking that her daughter would eventually belong to the Jiang family, she did not make things difficult. However, after Jiang achieved his goal, he abandoned the engagement and marriage, postponing it until now. Not only did the matter disappear like a stone sinking into the sea, but Jiang also disappeared. The Hu family was furious and filed a lawsuit in court. After repeated summonses, he could not be found, so a warrant was issued for his arrest. Recently, Hu Yu learned that Jiang had reconciled with his beloved wife, repaired the broken mirror, and lived together at number 51, Building Ye, Fuli Road. Therefore, she requested the court to consult with the Second Special Court to arrest Jiang and bring him to justice. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court to hear the case. Jiang Weiyu stated that he met Hu Caizhen on July 14th last year in the garden of Albert Road and had a dispute at the Shanghai dance hall. On July 20th, he was in the early stages of liquidating his slaughterhouse business and had no time for such jokes. Therefore, the accusations made by the plaintiff, such as going to the Xinxin Company to play, watching movies at Jincheng, and opening a room at the Yangzi Hotel, were completely untrue. As for the marriage, Gao Zigang did come to propose, but he refused because the woman claimed to be a dragon, and her age was relatively old. However, Hu Caizhen is the Shanghai dance girl Hu Didi, and there is nothing she cannot do, but he does not know. People in the Beijing Road area all know her reputation. They want to falsely accuse him, and there is nothing he can do. At this point, the official asked Gao Zigang for his statement. Gao Zigang stated that he was the matchmaker for the engagement between Jiang Weiyu and Hu Caizhen. The two of them went out on July 18th and did not return for two nights. Hu Yu asked him on the 20th if he knew where they were, but he did not. Later, at 3:00 PM, they returned one after another. Hu Yu questioned them about the night before, but Caizhen did not give a clear answer. The engagement was originally scheduled for the 20th, but Jiang went bankrupt, so it was not fulfilled. As for whether they opened a room, he did not know. At this point, Hu Yu stated that her daughter was ill and could not come. The official asked if she wanted to prosecute Jiang Weiyu. She replied that he had deceived her and raped her daughter. How could she not prosecute? She requested that he be investigated according to the law. The court ordered the case to be rescheduled and Hu Caizhen to be brought to court for further hearing. The defendant was returned to custody.

Inspector Li also brought Examiner Shen to the scene to identify the corpse and handed it over to Cai's wife, Xu, for burial.

### Hengfeng Road Police Station Recovers Abducted Child

At 6:10 AM yesterday, the Hengfeng Road Police Station in Zhabei received a report from Chinese Detective Lang Guangchun of the Huishi Police Department in the Public Concession, stating that Zhu Laowu had a five-year-old daughter named Mao Mao who had been abducted by the kidnapper Li Delin and hidden at number 6, Yuanfang Lane, Changan Road. He requested assistance. Director Lu Pei immediately sent police officer Zhao Yongqing and others to assist. They found Li Delin at number 6, Yuanfang Lane, Changan Road, arrested him, and recovered the five-year-old Zhu Maomao, a woman named Li Zhang, and a three-year-old girl named Li Gendi. After being taken to the police station, Li Delin and Li Zhang jointly stated that they were lovers and that Li Gendi was born to Li Zhang. As for Zhu Maomao, they said that a person named A Feng had entrusted her to them for foster care. After reviewing the confession, the police station determined that the case involved the abduction of a child. Therefore, at around 4:00 PM, they ordered the case to be transferred to the Police Headquarters for handling.

### Case of Counterfeiting Machine Still Requires Further Hearing and Witness Testimony

Lin Shizhong and Others Are More Closely Involved; Japanese Criminals Must Be Brought to Court for Confrontation

Japanese and Korean residents in Shanghai, Hidezaburo Hosokawa and others, organized a counterfeit printing operation for ten-yuan, five-yuan, and one-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications inside the house numbers sixty-one and sixty-one and sixty-three on Connaught Road and also had Suzhou native Lin Shizhong and Changzhou native Qian Jinfu to act as accessories. Shen Yifu (also known as Shen Liwu), a draughtsman from British American Tobacco Company and Zhou Yunhe (that is Qiu Yunhe), were also suspected of being involved. Chief Inspector Lu from the General Inspectorate led Detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Zhu Shuling, and Detective Song Bingzheng to smash the operation, seized the printing components, copper molds, as well as printed and unprinted counterfeit banknotes, and sent all the arrested Japanese and Korean male and female criminals to the Japanese Consulate for detention. Lin, Qian, Shen, and Zhou were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The circumstances are noted in previous reports. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin opened the court and ordered the four defendants, including Lin, to be brought to court for a further hearing. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police station, relayed the confession of Hidezaburo Hosokawa, who is now at the Japanese Consulate, stating that the matter was initiated last winter. A person named Sun Shaoshan proposed to Hosokawa to privately manufacture counterfeit banknotes. Hosokawa then told him that he needed 2,000 yuan to purchase the machines, and Sun handed over the money. Hosokawa then went to Japan with Korean Jeon Wu-soo to purchase the machines. In fact, the value of the machines was only 800 gold. In addition, Hosokawa also mentioned the conditions for remuneration. Unexpectedly, just as the project was progressing, Sun Shaoshan was arrested by the French Concession Police Department and sent to the Second Special Court for punishment, causing the matter to almost be interrupted. Later, they found Tao and Liu to cooperate. Liu rented the Longcheng Company's house on Connaught Road and began manufacturing. Lin Shizhong was responsible for installing machine components and printing. Although Lin claimed that he was an employee, Hosokawa said that he was not an employee. Qian Jinfu confessed to working as a tea servant in the operation. Although he knew it was illegal, he was trapped in it and could not escape. According to Hosokawa's confession, Qian went home every night, showing that Lin and Qian's confessions were difficult to believe. Therefore, it was still requested to postpone the hearing for a week and transfer Hosokawa and Sun Shaoshan from the Japanese Consulate and the French Police Department to the court for questioning to clarify the matter. As for Shen and Zhou, Hosokawa testified that they only had friendly relations, so the suspicion was slightly lighter and requested for verification. Judge Fu then briefly questioned the defendants. As the testimony of witnesses was still required, the hearing was postponed. He then ordered Shen Yifu and Zhou Yunhe to each pay 800 yuan as security from their shops. Lin Shizhong and Qian Jinfu were returned to custody, and the hearing was postponed for seven days.

### New Invention for Pre-Determining the Sex of a Child

— Luo Caiqing

Since the time of living in nests and caves, a child "only knew the mother, not the father." Perhaps that time was the era of women's power. Afterwards, women suffered misfortune, with the preference for sons over daughters, and it may continue forever. Parents do not find it annoying to have a group of sons, but if three daughters are born in a row, the person in charge of the baby collection box in the infant nursery may hear the bell ringing. This is the case of an ordinary family. It seems that two months ago, a couple who worked hard all day long could not even eat enough, and because they gave birth to three daughters in a row, they chopped the third daughter with a knife and abandoned her in the wilderness. It is said that in this way, they can have a son in the future. This couple's life is still precarious, but they can kill their own daughter, hoping to have a son in the future. This is indeed the superstitious view of foolish men and women, but their eagerness for a son can be seen from this.

Therefore, at one time, speculators published a book called "The Law of Freedom in Giving Birth to Boys and Girls" (the title of the book is probably like this). The advertisements boasted that giving birth to boys and girls can be done at will. Soon, even the book store closed down. However, in the hearts of parents who have no sons, this "Law of Freedom" always hopes that there will be a day when it can truly be "free."

Sure enough, yesterday's issue contained a translated manuscript entitled "A New Invention That Can Pre-Determine the Sex of Boys and Girls," stating that two medical consultants in Harley Street, London, are currently implementing a method for pre-determining male and female sexes. After many years of hard work, they have successfully developed a fluid that can guarantee that those who want to have a son will definitely have a son, and those who want to have a daughter will definitely have a daughter. It has now been tested more than a hundred times, and the results have been effective in 90% of the cases. Generally, wealthy households are already spending a lot of money to buy this fluid, and there is an endless stream of requests from all directions." According to the "dedicated research" of these two medical consultants, they will probably overcome the final difficulties soon, and make this fluid "hit the mark 100% of the time"? How happy will this make all the parents in the world who have no sons?

However, Professor Locke, a scientist and inventor at a certain university, said about this experiment: "After large-scale implementation in the future, I am afraid that there will be a danger of unequal numbers of men and women, because most parents are willing to have sons and unwilling to have daughters. Those who want to have boys account for 30%, and those who want to have girls account for only 1%." It can be seen that although Westerners everywhere LadiesFirst, "preference for sons over daughters" is the same. It is certain that the number of men will far exceed the number of women in the future. Therefore, Locke also said: "This experiment will not only cause family problems, but also national problems. Today's dictators all want to increase their combat power, and naturally want more boys to be born in the country. This is imaginable. If there is a great lack of women, it will easily lead to war. In ancient times, wars were often fought to seize women and food. Once women are greatly lacking, they will become valuable 'trophies.' I am afraid that wars will be fought for women in the future?"

This over-concern is not wrong. Germany is already desperately "encouraging reproduction" and "implementing marriage loan systems," but what will happen after "women are greatly lacking"? To seize this valuable "trophy," the world may have to return to the tribal era, and wars will be fought for a woman. Although things are valued for their scarcity, women will be in an even worse situation at that time, and they will become veritable slaves!

However, the disappointment of "dictators" will remain the same. Those "combatants" who are "encouraged" will probably pay attention to the gains and losses of the "trophies," and forget the important responsibility for which they were "encouraged."

### The Gtaue in the Astor Wilderness

— Shisi

——Third in a Series of Travel Notes

The wilderness was submerged in dust and sand, the sky filled with yellow mist, and the wind howled wildly, like an enraged lion. The southern storm was coming, and we, a group of travelers, were making our way through the wilderness of Astor.

Shouldering heavy luggage, we struggled through the forceful wind and sand, our ankles feeling as if bound by sandbags, making it strenuous to move forward step by step, yet each step became more tiring. The storm was coming, the yellow mist obscured the entire wilderness, and we could barely see a few steps ahead. We needed rest, we needed a forest to hide in, we needed to quickly find one.

The Astor wilderness, the Astor storm. A heavy lead weight pressed on our hearts. In the Astor wilderness—there were the fierce, barbaric… Gtaue (Note: Local dialect for robbers). Those red-skinned robbers who kill without batting an eye, plunder wealth, and specialize in slaughtering white people.

Back in Kotaloar, we had been told: “The Astor wilderness is full of Gtaue who kill white people and rob money, be careful.” Now, we had finally arrived in Astor, but, how unfortunate, we had encountered a storm, yellow sand and mist filling the surroundings, making it impossible to see the way ahead, and we would be subjected to a surprise attack by the Gtaue lurking in this wilderness without any means of prevention. A tragic fate would befall us at any moment.

“Everyone, load your guns, open fire together if anything happens!”

We all loaded our guns with live ammunition, one hand tightly gripping the luggage bag slung over our shoulders, and the other hand tightly gripping that little thing, the safety naturally off, ready to fire at any time.

The wind and sand grew even more violent, tiny pebbles striking our faces. “Whoosh… la…” The wilderness roared loudly. The sky grew darker, was the storm about to arrive? Facing the oncoming wind and sand, our steps grew more tired. Worry, terror… dominated everyone's hearts.

“Bang!…” A sharp gunshot rang out, swirling in the storm, spreading out, and subsiding.

We immediately and quickly crawled down.

“It was a mistake, I accidentally pulled the trigger, it was me, Algen!”

Our hearts, which had been hanging in mid-air, were placed back on the ground. Everyone let out a sigh of relief and got up from the ground, picked up their belongings, and continued on their way.

Suddenly, we heard the sound of hurried hooves behind us.

“Gtaue!…” A sudden terror gripped our hearts.

The sound of hooves grew closer and closer, but we still couldn't see them. – The sound of hooves was ringing out louder and louder.

“Bang!” Someone (one of our companions) fired a shot! The sound of hooves slowed down, slowly approaching with a “indeed, indeed…” sound.

Ah, red-skinned people, Gtaue?… We all stopped in astonishment.

A dozen or so mounted red-skinned Gtaue approached us, leading their horses. – They had no guns in their hands.

"Halt!"

"What is it, gentlemen, what is it?..."

The red-skinned Gtaue asked us in astonishment, they
were so astonished! Their voices trembled slightly.
Their whole bodies were convulsing.

"We also have guns, we are travelers, Gtaue,
be sensible!"

"Ah, Gtaue..." they exclaimed:
"Gentlemen, we are not Gtaue! We are
good residents of Astor Village!"

Everything immediately became clear.

"Gentlemen, the storm is coming, hurry up
and go to Astor Village ahead to take shelter!"
They were so kind.

We naturally accepted their invitation, following
them forward, these good residents of Astor Village
walking in front, we, holding the little thing with the safety off,
followed behind them, looking like a
convoy.

Finally, we were safely in Astor Village,
sheltering from the storm.

### The Mulian Play

— Wu Zantang

When I was a child, I was happy to hear that there was a play to watch, and I would rush to see it even if it was ten miles away. In our countryside, a Mulian play was performed every major year (Note). The performance of the Mulian play was usually in the off-season after the autumn harvest. (Note: That is, the year when the lunar calendar has a leap month.)

The Mulian play was different from the ordinary troupe plays; its origin was based on the legend of "Mulian Saving His Mother." The plays they performed during the day were similar to ordinary troupe plays, but the plays performed at night were all about gods and ghosts. According to them, if a god or ghost appeared on stage, then there would also be a real god or ghost under the stage. They often burned paper money on stage, and also surrounded the stage with a circle of incense, so timid people didn't dare to watch, and parents forbade their children from watching, but I often secretly watched behind my mother's back.

The most terrifying programs in the Mulian play were "Calling the Impermanence" and "Chasing the Hanging Woman." Calling the Impermanence involved a tall actor dressing up as the Impermanence in a desolate place in advance, and then a Grandma Impermanence and Son Impermanence would come out on stage! Those ghost wives and ghost sons would shout the name of the Impermanence on stage, and after shouting for a long time, the Impermanence would run onto the stage majestically in the sound of gongs and firelight. The program of Calling the Impermanence would then come to an end. This kind of comical play must have been very funny.

Chasing the Hanging Woman was even more interesting. The appearance of the Hanging Woman was very terrifying, her face was painted with red and green colors to make her look ugly, blood flowed from her seven orifices, and a long tongue protruded. Her hair was disheveled and draped around her, covered with many green paper ribbons. The clothes she wore were probably red, and her body was covered with paper money. She ran out, singing and acting wildly for a while, and then a Taoist-dressed person came out, also singing and acting wildly, without knowing what he was singing! Then five even uglier monsters with steel forks jumped out, seemingly listening to the Taoist's orders, and shouted in unison, chasing after the Hanging Woman to catch her. They chased her around the stage three times, and the Hanging Woman agilely jumped off the stage and ran out of the crowd. At this time, many people under the stage had already prepared, holding steel forks and torches in their hands, shouting to chase the Hanging Woman. After chasing the Hanging Woman out of the village, the Mulian play would be considered over.

It is said that the actor playing the Hanging Woman must have very fast feet to be able to take on this role. Otherwise, if she ran slowly and was caught by others, people would think it was an ominous sign and would beat the actor playing the Hanging Woman severely. Sometimes, they would accidentally beat the Hanging Woman to death. If they didn't do this, they wouldn't eliminate the disasters of the village. In their eyes, they took the Mulian play very seriously, and after performing a Mulian play this year, they could ensure the peace of the village. In particular, they regarded the program of Chasing the Hanging Woman as an incredibly mysterious thing.

However, I still don't understand why they must perform the Mulian play only in a major year; I only know that it is a kind of superstitious traditional concept in our countryside! If it is said that performing a Mulian play can eliminate the disasters of a village, then this is of course only to deceive simple-minded villagers and coax naive children, and now I will never believe that such a thing exists.

I haven't seen a Mulian play for many years now, but according to people from my hometown, the Mulian play is not often performed now, not because the villages today have broken superstition, but because the economic strength of the villages in recent years is not as prosperous as before. It costs several hundred dollars to perform a Mulian play!

### Sickness

— Lu Jia

On the white painted window, there were shadows of sunlight and swaying flower branches on the plain curtain. Opening the window, the slightly warm May breeze ruffled the stray hairs on my forehead. The peach blossoms in the garden were already in full bloom.

On the sickbed, I lost track of the days and months, and I dared not calculate them, because I was afraid to know how long I had been bedridden. But when I saw spring framing the window, I couldn't help but be secretly shocked: time is ruthless, and now I had already seen the second bloom of peach blossoms in the enclosure.

But the days in the hospital were lengthy. Insomnia at night made me anxious, and gazing at the dimness before me, I longed for the gray light of dawn to stain the window curtain. But during the day, I couldn't bear this boundless loneliness, and frequently looked at the watch at my bedside, waiting for the arrival of dusk. The silent long days were difficult to pass, and the doctor confiscated the books and paper I had hidden under my pillow. I could only turn through the few pages of pictures that I had already seen countless times all day long, or close my eyes and ponder deeply, allowing the footsteps of time to drag by slowly.

Who can describe the loneliness of this hospital: people spoke in low voices, tiptoeing through the long corridor, and even the sound of a falling petal could be heard clearly. Surrounding me were only the smell of carbolic acid, medicine bottles, cod liver oil, syringes, thermometers, and the gentle smile on the nurse's lips. The doctor with the pale scar on his jaw always treated me like a child, often deceiving me with jokes, especially about the date of discharge. The nurse's gesture of bringing the medicine to my lips was also embarrassing, because she was like persuading a stubborn little brother. "Be good and finish your medicine, and I'll give you a piece of candy." She was just short of saying those words.

Two years of life as a sick person had worn away my restless and impatient temperament, and now I was very much like a maiden locked in her boudoir, living a peaceful life on the sickbed. I respected the doctor's instructions: no longer asking fussily about the date of discharge; swallowing large mouthfuls of slightly bitter medicines; enduring the stinging pain of subcutaneous injections; even the cod liver oil that used to cause nausea was now not difficult to swallow. Only in the autumn, when the red cough pressed on my chest, when my cheeks were flushed and I suffered from insomnia at night, did I curse my illness, my attending doctor.

Sickness is unfortunate, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, which is said to follow the patient for life. I was already treading on the edge of death, and it was impossible to predict the fate that belonged to tomorrow. Therefore, facing the colorful peach blossoms in front of the window, I couldn't help but murmur silently:

—When the peach blossoms bloom next year.
