### Kong Xiangxi Meets with Hull to Discuss Financial and Economic Issues

Also Met with the U.S. Treasury Secretary Once; Busy with Social Engagements During Stay in the United States

[Washington] Chinese Minister of Finance Dr. Kong Xiangxi met with Secretary of State Hull today to discuss general financial and commercial issues in the Far East. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Wang Zhengting was also present. The content of the talks was not announced. When Kong arrived here today, the Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Department of the State Department, Hornbeck, Ambassador Wang, and more than 50 Chinese overseas Chinese went to the station to welcome him. Kong first went to the embassy to rest, and then visited the Secretary of State. After the talks, Hull hosted a luncheon for Minister Kong. Those invited to accompany him included Eccles, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Taylor, Undersecretary of the Treasury; Jones, Director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation; Pierson, President of the Export-Import Bank; Woodring, Secretary of War; and Ambassador Wang and other important figures from both China and the United States. Local officials believe that Kong's visit to the United States is of a "educational" nature, as he aims to show Europe and the United States the unprecedented progress of China's industry and economic construction. At the same time, he also wants to create a suitable atmosphere so that he can obtain credit from the United States when there is a special need. Pierson, the president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank's visit to China, is a sign of the United States' deep attention to China's construction plans. Therefore, it is believed here that a formal announcement will be made soon after Kong's arrival in the United States. Observers also said that Kong's trip is similar to the situation when Song Ziwen came to the United States before the U.S. loan to China for cotton and wheat in 1933. Therefore, everyone speculates that Kong must be preparing to borrow from the United States, but the purpose of the loan has not yet been announced. However, linking the feelings of the United Kingdom and the United States is certainly also Kong's main policy. (28th National Telegraph)

[Washington] Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau announced today that he had met with Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting, but "only talked about the friendship between the two countries." When asked whether a communiqué would be issued on this conversation in the future, the Secretary of the Treasury only said "I don't know." As for the silver issue, the Secretary of the Treasury's answer was incomprehensible. It is impossible to determine whether it was discussed today or will be discussed in the future. Some authoritative sources believe that the Secretary of the Treasury's words imply that the U.S. does not intend to raise the silver issue unless Kong raises it. Moreover, since China has stable exchange rates and sufficient reserves, there is no need to sell silver at present. (28th National Telegraph)

[Washington] Dr. Kong Xiangxi met with Jones, director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, again today. It is said that Jones and Pierson, president of the Export-Import Bank, will announce the results of Pierson's recent visit to China tomorrow. The content has not been disclosed today, but it is known that Pierson has studied the possibility of funding the export of machinery industry and railway supplies to China. Jones is the person who previously handled the Sino-American cotton and wheat loan. In addition, according to senior Chinese officials here today, someone recently suggested to Kong Xiangxi to lend money to China to consolidate domestic debts with high interest rates. However, this proposal did not originate from the United States, but mostly from the United Kingdom. Kong is very interested in this financial reorganization plan, because the 8% interest rate on domestic debt is indeed too high. However, Kong does not intend to borrow foreign debt to start new businesses. The old government's revenue deposits and foreign exchange surplus are sufficient to cope with them. Pierson also told reporters from the Associated Press today that he was satisfied with the current state of China's railways, and that the unification of the routes has also made great progress. Tonight, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting hosted a banquet for Kong. Many important officials from the Ministry of Finance, silver experts, and bankers were invited, including Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Undersecretary Taylor, Balance Fund expert Lochhead, Senators Sheppard, King, William, McNary, and Thomas, President of the Rural Finance Corporation Eccles, and Pierson. When Hull hosted a banquet for Kong this afternoon, members of the Democratic and Republican parties of the House Banking and Currency Committee were invited to attend. (28th National Telegraph)

Vice President Kong and others got out of the car in the midst of enthusiastic welcome and took a car to the new embassy to rest. His entourage stayed at the Sheridan Hotel. The cars in which Kong and others were riding totaled more than 30, and military police rode motorcycles to protect and lead the way.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Flood Prevention Work Cannot Be Ignored

— Du

Continuous days of wind and rain have caused floods everywhere. The Yellow River in Shandong is being directly impacted by the heavy flow. The Li Sheng Tun Dam has collapsed. The Jiangshui River in Wuhan has overflowed and risen wildly, breaking the record of the previous year. The fierce flow of the Yongding River and the rising of the Nan Hun River are frightening. In other places, such as the Ganjiang River in Jiangxi, the Minjiang River in Fujian, the Qiantang River and Lanjiang River in Zhejiang, and the Dongjiang River and Hanjiang River in Guangdong, either only the riverbanks are flooded, or the dikes and weirs are broken through. They echo each other, as if singing in chorus, taking advantage of the time to wreak havoc and harm the people. The railway tracks are destroyed and transportation is blocked. The disaster is already pitiful. The city walls of Fujian have also suffered water disasters within two weeks. People's homes have been destroyed and they have no way to cook. Coffins and corpses float everywhere. The scene is sad and indescribable. Now it is still the season of the Yellow Plum rain. Major and minor floods are already threatening each other. In a blink of an eye, the big flood season will begin. The situation will definitely be more rampant. If we do not plan ahead now, how can we ensure peace in the future? We do not hesitate to talk about it as an old saying and disturb the ears of the current sages, just to fulfill our responsibility to remind them.

Floods have long been a major enemy of the people's livelihood in our country. The key is that proper guidance can fortunately avoid it for a while. The serious disaster situation in the 20th year of the Republic of China is still stored in our hearts. The tragic impressions of the previous year are even more vivid. The wounds have not healed and the hidden pain is deep. Learning from the past and knowing the future, we should think about preventive measures when the new disaster comes. However, ordinary people are accustomed to following the old ways and are reluctant to change. Officials only seek to deal with things perfunctorily and cannot distinguish between urgent and important matters. Therefore, there are often many statements in the court, but there is no way to compromise. Documents are delivered, but there are no practical results. This is okay in peaceful times, but during the great floods, delaying things will only delay the opportunity. Therefore, today's flood prevention must be done with one heart and one mind, working together to think about disaster relief as if it were our own problem, and using all our strength to eliminate the sudden crisis. Everyone should shake off the lax spirit and strive for quick responses in everything. Even if the torrents are extremely difficult to control, we can still prevent them from happening now. The fact that we were able to safely pass through the autumn floods last year proves that it was not only due to natural disasters, but also due to the efforts of human beings. This year, we have inherited the surplus of last year's prosperity. I am really afraid that the officials will be complacent about the recent achievements and forget the past failures. Therefore, I specially put forward this suggestion to remind them to examine themselves. I sincerely hope that the responsible parties can handle this flood prevention work with more precise planning and more resolute efforts.

### French New Cabinet Announces Policy Guidelines to the House

Strictly Prohibit Speculation and Maintain Finances; Focus on Peace and Social Progress

[Paris] The new cabinet attended the House of Representatives for the first time at 3:00 PM today, and Premier Chautemps immediately read out the policy guidelines, stating, "The most urgent responsibility of the current government, and the reason for its establishment, is to immediately take strict measures to curb speculation, maintain France's gold reserves, meet the needs of the treasury, maintain budget balance, regulate commodity prices, and revive the national economy." As for the financial reorganization bill proposed by Finance Minister Bonnet, which advocates authorizing the government to take swift action to deal with contingencies, the cabinet is willing to bear full political responsibility. The cabinet is willing to establish good understanding with the Senate and the House of Representatives, and is committed to continuing cooperation with the Popular Front. "The two basic ideals that Republicans have particularly emphasized over the years are peace and social progress. The current government will do its best to implement them. As for diplomacy, the current government will continue to maintain traditional foreign policy within the scope of international justice and the independence of all nations, with the current friendship and the League of Nations as its destination, and strive to expand international cooperation to the greatest extent possible. All forms of coercive measures will be consistently rejected, and threats from others will never be tolerated. In addition, we must maintain maximum national defense to ensure national security. "We hereby appeal to the people and governments of all countries to sincerely support economic cooperation and limit armaments, so that lasting cooperative relationships can be established among the people of all countries." As for domestic affairs, any actions that undermine the recently established social laws will not be recognized under the current circumstances. The current government will also promote mutual trust between labor and management, so that these social laws can be adapted to the needs of the national economy. In addition, there are various reforms that remain to be carried out, such as the extension of the validity of work contracts signed by labor and management in industry and commerce, the revision of rents and commercial debt interest rates, amnesty for those who violate the press law, and the promotion of agricultural education and agricultural organizations. The above are all major issues that must be gradually implemented in light of the country's economic capacity, and cannot be achieved overnight. At this time, we can only "temporarily suspend" various social legislation works in accordance with the policy set by the previous cabinet. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)

[Paris] The House of Representatives has passed the cabinet's policy guidelines declaration with 393 votes against 142. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)

### French House of Representatives Passes Vote of Confidence in Chautemps Cabinet

Agricultural Improvement Bill to be Discussed Today; Financial Reorganization Bill Also to be Proposed

[Paris] Premier Chautemps recently read out a declaration of policy guidelines in the House of Representatives, stating that the current government is determined to take the public opinion expressed in the general election as its guiding principle. When he mentioned foreign policy, members of the left-wing parties repeatedly applauded. The Premier said, "Peace cannot be sought through surrender. The result of surrender is only enslavement and war." When Premier Chautemps criticized financial chaos and announced the government's decision to crack down on speculation, members of the central parties, and even some members of the right-wing parties, applauded along with the left-wing members. Premier Chautemps then requested the House of Representatives to postpone questioning the government's general policies, and submitted this request as a motion of confidence for a vote, stating, "It is now suggested to adopt a simple procedure, please the House of Representatives express confidence in the current government, and hope that the spokespersons of all parties briefly explain their attitudes, and I will briefly answer." After the Premier finished his speech, Communist Representative Renaud immediately took the stage and said, "The content of the political program, especially the agricultural reform, needs to be supplemented and explained urgently. The Communist Party is willing to express its confidence in the current government and requests that the House of Representatives not adjourn before passing the agricultural bill." The leader of the right-wing Republican Democratic Union, Maran, and the chairman of the central Democratic Alliance party group, Bardy, then delivered short speeches. Premier Chautemps then gave a general response and told Renaud that the cabinet will discuss the agricultural bill tomorrow. He then praised former Premier Blum and said, "Reorganizing finances is the responsibility and honor of Republicans." At this point, the House of Representatives passed the motion of confidence with 393 votes against 142.

### French Stock Exchange Closed for One Day

England Suspends Trading in Francs

[Paris] All national stock exchanges and commodities exchanges have been ordered to close for one day, and debtors who need to pay for various bills in foreign currency or in cash can apply for an extension. The Ministry of Finance took preventive measures for fear that speculators might take the opportunity to manipulate the market price of the franc during the discussion of the financial reorganization bill proposed by Finance Minister Bonnet in the Senate and the House of Representatives, and there is no special significance to it. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)

[London] The London Banking Committee, because the French authorities decided to temporarily suspend trading on the Paris Stock Exchange before the plan to deal with the national financial difficulties was submitted to the House of Representatives, held a meeting today and decided that the Exchange should temporarily suspend trading in francs, pending action by France.

### French Financial Counselor Visits British Authorities

Says Willing to Continue Cooperation

[London] French Financial Counselor to the British Embassy, Moyik, visited the British Treasury authorities this morning, informing them of the measures taken by the French government in finance, and declaring that the French government is willing to continue cooperating with the United States and Britain in accordance with the Tripartite Monetary Agreement. On this issue, British financial circles believe that the franc's exchange rate should be allowed to rise and fall on its own, as was done before the late French Premier Poincaré stabilized the franc on June 24, 1928. This approach is in line with the current situation and is generally supported by British financial circles. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)

### International Exchange Equalization Fund

British House of Commons Passes Increase

[London] The British House of Commons today passed a resolution authorizing the government to increase the Exchange Equalization Fund from £350 million to £550 million. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon claimed when proposing the bill that the government would not suffer a sharp loss of gold, which would lead to inaction. As of March 30, the Exchange Equalization Fund had a total of 26,644,000 ounces of cash, and the Bank of England stored 73,842,000 ounces of gold on the same day. Simon believes that this amount of gold reserves is not excessive, and the reason for the increase in the Exchange Equalization Fund is the transfer of floating capital. After that, the gold storage accounts every six months can be published three months after the end of each period. Furthermore, the existing policy will not be changed, because this policy is extremely important in ensuring and fulfilling the Tripartite Monetary Agreement under the current international situation. (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuters)

[Washington] When asked if the French financial situation had any impact on the operation of the Tripartite Monetary Agreement between the United States, Britain, and France, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau replied that the operation of the agreement had not changed, and also said that the amount of the U.S. Exchange Equalization Fund would not be increased.

Tokyo Correspondence

### The Political and Economic Power of Japan's First Zaibatsu, Mitsui (3)

— Nagumo

(5) Seihin Ikeda's Leadership in Politics

Who helped Mitsui transform from being threatened by fascism to leading fascism? This is Seihin Ikeda.

Seihin Ikeda is the "manager" of the Mitsui family, having served Mitsui for more than forty years. The Mitsui family trusts him very much. In the past twenty years, Mitsui capital has been completely under his guidance, so in fact, he is also the leader of Japanese capitalism.

The Mitsui family's reliance on externally hired "managers" did not begin with Seihin Ikeda, and there is a historical basis for this. The Mitsui family's family precepts have always stated: "The key to commerce lies in being able to employ appropriate talents, and it is necessary to eliminate the old and employ the new." The formulation of the family precepts dates back to before the Meiji Restoration, and the vision of the founders of the Mitsui family is truly astonishing.

Each stage of Mitsui's development is due to the planning of strategists. The first phase was helping the Meiji Restoration to break away from the oppression of the feudal shogunate. This undertaking was completed single-handedly by San Nomura, the then "manager" of Mitsui. During the war, the Mitsui family suffered no small sacrifices, but after the war, Mitsui obtained many benefits from the government. This is the first foundation for the smooth development of the Mitsui kingdom.

The second phase was guiding Mitsui from commercial capital to industrial capital, and this was done by two other Mitsui "managers," Kawa Nakakami and Takashi Masuda. After Kawa Nakakami and Takashi Masuda, came today's Seihin Ikeda.

When the Ugaki Cabinet failed and the Hayashi Cabinet was formed, everyone knew that the Hayashi Cabinet was a strong cabinet with a more pronounced fascist character. However, the Minister of Finance of the Hayashi Cabinet, Toyotaro Yuki, joined hands with Mitsui strategist Seihin Ikeda (Ikeda took office as the president of the Bank of Japan). Isn't Seihin Ikeda faithfully representing the interests of Mitsui? From this cooperation, the future of Japanese fascism can be foreseen—that is, taking off the disguise of being anti-zaibatsu and helping to strengthen financial capital control.

Now, among those who are anti-zaibatsu in Japan, there are already many who secretly fawn on the zaibatsu. This is the progress of the zaibatsu's work, and it is also the great achievement of Ikeda Seihin, the leader of the zaibatsu. Ikeda Seihin is the highest mechanic who is loyal to the zaibatsu and promotes the structure of Japanese capitalism.

After the "February 26th" incident, Ikeda, on the one hand, used the relationship of the Kokuhonsha (a Japanese fascist group, most of whose members were soldiers, which was disbanded after the "February 26th" incident) to connect with the upper echelons of the military. On the other hand, he built Mitsui, expressed a shift in direction, and sent overtures to society and young soldiers. At the same time, he used the Osaka Political and Economic Research Association to support existing political parties as much as possible. As a result, from the end of last autumn, political parties began to become active. Baba's finances only slightly cared for the rural areas because of the emphasis on the military's advocated broad national defense, so he could not help but declare his downfall under the resistance of the capitalists.

The success of the Yuki finances lies in sacrificing the rural areas, which everyone admits. If the interests of the rural areas are neglected, what is the meaning of "broad national defense"? However, there is already the following argument in the military:

"In order to complete the national defense plan, it is necessary to avoid friction with the financial community. At present, expanding productive capacity is more necessary than anything else. National defense policy can only have a way out if it is harmonized with financial capital and military demand industrial capital."

The military has retreated from broad national defense to narrow national defense. Strengthening "Manchukuo" is the unanimous call of the "military" and "financial" circles in Japan. The slogans of "overthrowing the zaibatsu" and "reviving the rural areas" have been collected in the historical library. The fascist heroes who launched the "February 26th" incident are either dead, imprisoned, or "purged" from active military personnel. Even radical factions like Itagaki can't get ahead now. The one who is guiding politics is Seihin Ikeda—the spokesperson for the Mitsui zaibatsu. Japanese fascism is changing! It will change from "anti-zaibatsu" to "pro-zaibatsu."

In fact, this is the progress of Japanese fascism, and this is the fundamental meaning of fascism's existence.

Recently, Mitsui invested 30 million yen to open an aircraft manufacturing plant. Unless the existing social structure is fundamentally destroyed, the zaibatsu will always have a way. Ikeda's current appointment as the president of the Bank of Japan is another new stage in the development of Japanese financial capital. As for the profound impact on Japanese society and the international situation as a result, that is beyond the scope of this article.

### Germany and Italy Oppose British and French Supervision of the Spanish Issue

Believes it Destroys the European Balance of Power; Non-Intervention Committee Adjourns

[London] The representatives of the nine countries of the Non-Intervention Committee met here today. The representatives of Germany and Italy expressed their opposition to the British and French plans to supervise all Spanish naval affairs, and the meeting was adjourned until Friday to allow the representatives of each country to consult with their own governments and make a final decision. (29th, National Telegraph)

[London] The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War recently issued a communiqué stating that Italian Representative Grandi had declared that since the implementation of the measure prohibiting volunteers from joining the two sides in the Spanish civil war in December of last year, no volunteers from Italy had gone to the country, and all rumors were false. At this point, the chairman of the Adjustment Committee, British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, explained the new maritime supervision plan proposed by Britain and France. The representatives of Germany and Italy immediately agreed to consult their respective governments and, in principle, raised objections, stating that all plans that cannot maintain a balance between the countries are inconvenient to endorse, and that all personnel from these countries who are engaged in supervision work on the land borders of Spain should be ordered to withdraw. After the representatives of other countries agreed to consult with their respective governments, Chairman Lord Plymouth also raised the issue of volunteer withdrawal. French Representative Corbin immediately, on behalf of his government, proposed that foreign combatants who have been injured or captured should be withdrawn immediately, and that an agreement must be established. The subcommittee adjourned until July 2 to discuss the two issues of volunteer withdrawal and the new maritime supervision plan. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)

[London] Regarding the Spanish issue, the new maritime supervision plan proposed by Britain and France has been objected to by Germany and Italy. British officials recently declared that this was the result of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's firm request to Germany yesterday afternoon to act in concert. After the German government agreed, it immediately ordered its ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop, to return to London immediately to respond to the situation. As a result, the supervisory system will be declared over, and the countries concerned will contact each other within this week in order to restore the original situation in December of last year, that is, each country declared neutrality, but Germany and Italy have reserved the right to reconsider the entire issue of the non-intervention policy, or may propose a counter-proposal. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)

### Spanish Supervision Measures Now on the Verge of Extinction

Britain Still Adheres to the Non-Intervention Policy; Italian Newspapers Say There Will Be Major Developments

[London] Regarding the future of the Spanish non-intervention supervision measures, general observers are pessimistic, believing that the supervision measures will inevitably disappear sooner or later, but it is said that Britain seems to have obtained a guarantee from Germany that it will never attack the Spanish Republican government in the future. At the same time, the chairman of the Adjustment Committee, British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, held talks with French Ambassador Corbin today and made a final decision on the Spanish maritime supervision plan proposed by Britain and France. The plan stipulates that Britain and France will be responsible for the supervision work of the Spanish seas in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean, respectively, and will also assign neutral inspectors to board the warships participating in the supervision to show credibility. This plan will be submitted by Lord Plymouth to the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee tomorrow, and the representatives of each country will be asked to approve it or propose alternative suggestions. At that time, the German representative will probably ask for a considerable amount of time to send a message to Berlin for instructions, and the Italian representative will also take this attitude. According to the impression gained by the general public, Germany and Italy do not agree, and it is expected that Germany can accept it in principle, while Italy is not necessarily. Therefore, this issue must be decided after the representatives of Germany and Italy have received instructions from their respective governments before the subcommittee can be convened for a final decision. (Central News Agency, 28th, Havas)

[London] With Germany and Italy withdrawing from the Spanish coast supervision plan, the filling of the gap by Britain and France has been opposed by Germany and Italy. Italian newspapers have recently launched a fierce attack on Britain, and the Forum newspaper said, "If we clearly say that there will be major new developments in Spain in a few days, it is not revealing any secrets." According to the remarks made by Mussolini's mouthpiece Gaida in Rome, Germany and Italy cannot allow Britain and France to monopolize the Spanish coast supervision plan. This remark can well represent the official opinion and says that the monopolization of the Spanish coast by Britain and France will cause the expansion of communist forces in Spain. Gaida also expressed his approval of Hitler's speech in Würzburg on Sunday, saying that the experience gained by Germany in Spain is an indelible lesson, and proved the prediction of the early victory of Spanish National Army leader General Franco, which shows that Italy has now adopted a stronger attitude. In addition, German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop has returned to Britain from Berlin and has probably been specifically instructed on the filling of the Spanish coast supervision gap by Britain and France. According to people close to the German Foreign Ministry, the Non-Intervention Committee is likely to encounter difficulties, because Germany and Italy will express doubts and fears. If the committee cannot make a decision that satisfies the two countries, then the old agreements, such as the agreement in December 1936 stipulating that each country should individually avoid intervention in the Spanish war, can be re-submitted. If so, the entire supervision plan will become a harmless thing. (Central News Agency, 29th, Reuters)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden, in response to several questions raised by members of the House of Commons, confirmed the intention of Britain and France to replace Germany and Italy in undertaking the entire Spanish maritime supervision work. Labour Member of Parliament Feller then asked whether the attitude taken by Germany and Italy was sufficient to endanger the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Eden replied that Britain had decided to adhere to the non-intervention policy. (Central News Agency, 28th, Havas)

### A Spanish Government Aircraft Shot Down into the Sea by a German Aircraft

Four People Aboard Rescued by a British Ship; One of Them Has Died of Serious Injuries

### Prime Minister van Zeeland's Speech and Impression of Visiting the United States

Removing Trade Barriers: America Inclined to Assist

[New York] Prime Minister van Zeeland of Belgium recently delivered a speech at a banquet of the American Foreign Policy Association, briefly stating that his impressions from this trip concerned two matters: curbing the arms race and removing international trade barriers. The U.S. government is determined to participate in resolving these issues. "According to several factors, the world economy is already showing signs of improvement, but this is more pronounced in the domestic economies than in the global economy. The improvement in the domestic and foreign economies of some countries is partly due to the expansion of armaments, which is an artificial method of promotion. Most other countries have faced various economic and political difficulties since the economic panic of 1929. Even countries with economic recovery are hampered by the turbulent international situation. International trade is unable to develop effectively due to various countries' restrictions on capital flow and the confusion in the monetary situation. The only way to alleviate this is for countries to remove tariff barriers. I know that all countries in the world do not want to see war, but some countries, due to economic difficulties, may also cause war. It is rumored that my trip is to represent Europe to borrow money from the United States to reorganize finances and finance, which is not true." Prime Minister van Zeeland is scheduled to go to Washington tomorrow afternoon at the invitation of President Roosevelt for lunch, and then return home on the French mail ship "Normandie" on the 30th.

The Pravda also published news from Bolshoy, stating that Japan and "Manchukuo" often violated the Soviet border on the Heilongjiang River. For example, the "Manchukuo"-affiliated gunboats "Dingjiang" and "Qinren" entered Soviet territory near Noyagoe on May 21. On June 1, a "Manchukuo" small boat carrying many soldiers landed near the Soviet Konstantinovka and set up outposts. On June 19, another seventy "Manchukuo" soldiers invaded the vicinity of Konstantinovka and were repelled by the Soviet border guards.

Most Willing to Help with New Deal Legislation Program

[Washington] President Roosevelt and members of the Democratic Party in both the Senate and the House of Representatives held a three-day meeting on Jefferson Island.

Travel Correspondence

### National Defense Money (15)

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Uncle Di

(C) Content – The content is really too vast and too detailed. Here, only a general outline is provided. Except for judicial independence, which is not included here, all other aspects of measures are generally included and listed. The main objects are political and economic aspects. The political part roughly includes: rectifying officialdom, reorganizing the police, clarifying land, investigating household registration, changing etiquette and customs, organizing relief work, improving sanitation, reforming village administration, promoting local autonomy, rectifying land taxes, reorganizing old taxes, promoting new taxes, reorganizing financial administration, developing financial undertakings, reorganizing schools, promoting social education, and so on. The economic part includes five items: agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, and transportation. Regarding agriculture, there are regulations on water conservancy, cotton planting, forest reclamation, animal husbandry, and other agricultural promotion agencies and guidance facilities, such as cooperative undertakings, experimental farms, and so on. The industrial part is divided into mechanical industry, dyeing and weaving industry, electrical industry, chemical industry, and so on. The commercial part includes reorganizing finance, encouraging exports, reducing imports, public commercial undertakings, commercial surveys and guidance, cultivating and employing people in villages, and so on. The mining part includes developing unoperated mines, reorganizing operated mines, establishing mining agencies, raising mining capital, and so on. The transportation part includes: railway plans, highway plans, waterway plans, telephone plans, postal and telegraph plans, and so on. The outline of the plan can be divided into the following points: ㊀ Main points. ㊁ A total of three parts are listed: Part 1, General Rules, with six clauses. Part 2, Department of Provincial Construction. Part 3, Department of County and Village Construction. Part 2 is further divided into four chapters: (A) Political aspects. There are two sections: Section 1, Improving the current political system. Items such as "must be achieved" and "expected to be achieved" are listed separately. Section 2, Completing local autonomy, which is further divided into eight clauses. (B) Economic aspects, with three sections: ㊀ Increasing people's production, divided into three clauses. ㊁ Developing public undertakings, with "clauses". ㊂ Facilities for economic control in provinces, counties, and villages, divided into two clauses. (C) Provincial Government Construction Research Institute, divided into four sections. (D) Supplementary provisions, divided into four clauses. Part 3 is the Department of County and Village Construction. (Specifies that county and village administrative plans should be compiled by the county and village themselves.) The last part is the appendix, with two clauses.

This is the general content of the once-famous "Ten-Year Construction Plan of Shanxi Province." However, in addition to this, the authorities in Shanxi once specifically stated: "The political and economic matters listed in this plan are only those that are currently included in the plan and can be generally determined; those that are not included in this plan but should be organized at any time within ten years should be organized, and it does not mean that matters not listed in this plan are administrative matters." Therefore, its content can still be added at any time as needed by the environment. Looking at the essence and intention of such a large-scale plan, I think it is not impossible to say that it is a mutated form of total mobilization.

(D) Time Limit and Steps – Why exactly is it set as "ten years"? According to the explanation of the authorities in Shanxi, there are two aspects of reasons: domestic environment and foreign environment. Domestically, they believe that our political and social situation is not on the right track, so at the beginning, it takes three to five years to remove obstacles to construction and prepare for the implementation of construction. China must become strong, and Shanxi cannot be an exception. As for the foreign environment, according to the estimate of the Shanxi authorities at the time, within ten years, all the naval, land, and air force preparations of the major powers will be completed, and then the East Asian problem will be completely resolved. Therefore, "China must have a solution within these ten years, and it will be too late if it is delayed." At the same time, they also stated: Although it is set for ten years, it would be better if it can be completed in less than ten years.

According to the opinions of the authorities in Shanxi, the steps to implement this plan can be divided into two aspects: the first three years, with politics as the center, focusing on removing obstacles to construction and establishing the foundation of democratic politics; the last seven years, with economy as the center, to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency. However, the division of steps is only based on the emphasis, and it does not mean that the first three years are all political construction and there is no economic construction; or that the last seven years are only economic construction and there is no political construction.

This plan was finalized at the end of the twenty-first year, and it has been four or five years now. If calculated according to the initial calculation of the Shanxi authorities, then it should be exactly the time to step into the second stage.

(E) Final Purpose—What exactly is the final purpose of this "Ten-Year Plan"? We can already deduce this from the motive for their creation of this plan. Here, I would like to describe the specific goals hoped for by the authorities in Shanxi. According to their explanation, what they hope for after the implementation of this plan is: in the political aspect, Shanxi should achieve thorough democracy; in the economic aspect, Shanxi should achieve "the situation where the social and economic income is more than the expenditure." In this way, national defense has protection and a foundation. At the same time, they have a further explanation for the increase in the so-called "social economy," that is: "At least, it can reach an average increase of 20 yuan in production value per person per year."

Mr. Yan Chenchuan, the highest authority in charge of this plan, once said: "Methods can be changed at any time within a reasonable scope; the purpose must not be shaken."

(F) Implementation Methods and Determination—The authorities in Shanxi also know that it is "a pioneering initiative in the political history of China" to implement such a large and arduous plan with the political power of a province. Its significance is nothing less than turning "a government with accumulated abuses into a productive government." They also anticipated the difficulties ahead, so in terms of specific methods, they intend to adapt to the environment and change at any time. Moreover, they plan to set up a research institute first, and designate Yangqu, Taiyuan, and Yuci as experimental areas, hoping to obtain theories from practice and methods from experience. The methods to be promoted temporarily are: ㊀ The Shanxi authorities implement performance appraisal methods to urge the people to produce with political power. ㊁ All departments, offices, bureaus, and county governments must bear the responsibility of supervising and guiding the fish based on the plan. ㊂ Establish a dedicated agency for the implementation plan to strive to promote it. ㊃ It is hoped that "no matter the agency, group, or individual, anyone who has a share of responsibility should do their part and never shirk or perfunctorily."

When we examine the methods used by the Shanxi authorities to promote the plan, we always feel that it is a bit vague and not very certain. However, this shortcoming can be remedied in part by the determination of the Shanxi authorities.

They clearly acknowledge that it must be a very difficult task to vigorously promote this plan. However, they believe that the country has reached this point. It goes without saying how great the pain is if it is unfortunately destroyed: but to seek strength, it cannot be obtained from comfort. Mr. Yan Baichuan once had such a warning: "If this group of officials (referring to the old-fashioned Chinese officials) is gathered together and explained the necessary requirements for a strong country, and everyone votes, they certainly dare not agree to the destruction of the country, but I am afraid they dare not raise their hands to agree to the strong country." Therefore, they advocate that in order to implement this "self-improvement" plan, officials and people alike must be determined to sacrifice, endure great pain, grit their teeth, and work hard for decades. Therefore, they also advocate that during this period of promotion and construction, "negligence" crimes should be established for officials and "obstruction" crimes should be established for the people. All officials and people who cannot follow this plan shall be punished according to these two crimes. Even if this leads to a "productive terror era," it is impossible because of the national crisis, and it is also worthwhile for the sake of eliminating the national crisis.

Mr. Yan Baichuan once stated: "The implementation of the plan requires the responsibility of the people of the whole province. It is not something that can be implemented just by my saying so. However, I really have the determination to implement it this time. I am willing to supervise the people of the whole province to do this, overcoming all difficulties and all concerns. Even though the successful construction of Shanxi Province alone cannot be said to be the overall strength of the country, the country will naturally have a part of hope if one province can embark on a new political path." This statement, in the eyes of the reporter, can be said to be precisely representative of the overall determination and ambition of the Shanxi authorities.

### A Poisonous Plan of a Certain Army in Guanwai to Form a Pseudo-Anti-Communist Army

Using Pseudo-Army to Slaughter the Righteous Army in Chahar North, Liu Guitang and Bai Jianwu are Accomplices

Tianjin Correspondence After the uprising of the people in Chahar North, the righteous flags were everywhere in Chongli, Shangyi, Shangdu, and Huade counties, and the total number of the righteous army was no less than tens of thousands. Among the leaders, in addition to Zhang Chengde and Li Tingyuan, there were also Zhang Zhongying and Li Ying. The situation was huge, and the puppet Mongolian military government was extremely shaken. Although a certain military headquarters in Guanwai had ordered a unit of the Sato Division stationed in Rehe to enter and exit Dolon to intercept the righteous army from entering the puppet Manchukuo, the Righteous Army did not dare to go deep because Shangdu and Chongli had not fallen, and the people in the puppet territory also had a tendency to raise their poles. Therefore, a certain military stationed in the puppet territory could hardly transfer a large army to attack, but strictly ordered the puppet army to strengthen the walls and clear the fields, and guard the important cities and towns of Shangdu and Huade to resist the Righteous Army. At the same time, they used the cunning scheme of Chinese killing each other, because they recruited the bandit leader Liu Guitang, who had been rampant in the Zhilu area, and the former Zhilu Army brigade commander Ma Tingfu, Xia Zhenhua, and Bai Jianwu to organize the so-called North China Anti-Communist Army, which was controlled by the North China Anti-Communist and Long Association of a certain military headquarters in Guanwai, and the Ronin Miura was in charge of the matter. Liu Guitang was the puppet commander-in-chief, Bai Jianwu was the puppet army commander, and Ma Tingfu and Xia Zhenhua were each the puppet division commander, and they secretly recruited bandits and old troops of the Zhilu Army in various parts of southern Hebei, and took Jixian and Zunhua, the puppet Jidong area, as training areas, which were responsible by Ma Tingfu and Xia Zhenhua. In the past two months, more than 5,000 people have been recruited. On June 20, Miura flew to Guanwai to receive military pay and clothing, and accompanied a certain staff officer of a certain military in Guanwai to Tianjin to meet with Liu Guitang and Bai Jianwu to give instructions and issue military supplies. Since the 26th, the pseudo-army has been crossing the Great Wall along the Gubeikou Avenue to Rehe and turning to Chahar North. In early July, they will be concentrated in Shangdu and Zhangbei to listen to the roll call of Tanaka, the head of the special agency stationed in Jiabusi by a certain party, and then Liu Guitang will command and divide the guerrilla righteous army near Shangdu and Huade. Liu Guitang himself, accompanied by Miura, accompanied by two Ronin Baolu and several pseudo-staff members, took a certain company's plane to Zhangbei on the 26th, while Bai Jianwu temporarily stayed in a certain concession in Tianjin to negotiate. The reason why a certain military headquarters in Guanwai ordered Liu Bai to form a pseudo-Anti-Communist Army was that the uprising of the people in Chahar North was a Red Army commando team in contact with the Communist Army in Shaanxi, which would invade the puppet Manchukuo, and even ordered Liu Bai to slaughter it. Its intention was very sinister.

It is also heard that more than 10,000 pseudo-Anti-Communist Army symbols have been made and transported from Tianjin to Chahar North on the 24th. A certain party ordered the six divisions recruited by Liu Bai to be divided into two armies so that they can lead them separately. Therefore, there are still traitors left by Liu Bai secretly recruiting in Daming, Anci, Wuqing, Youan, Xinghao, and Mancheng, and sending them to Zunji counties for training. (28th)

### Songjiang Land Administration Bureau's Assessment of Land Prices Violates Procedures

Landowners Present to Various Agencies to Correct and Request Handling in Accordance with Legal Procedures

Songjiang Correspondence The Land Administration Bureau recently announced the land prices in this county, but its assessment procedures did not follow the prescribed procedures, so all people in the county expressed opposition. Recently, Li Xiuzhe and other landlords in the second district specially presented to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, the County Party Department, the County Government, and the County Land Administration Bureau to request legal correction. The original presentation is as follows: "For the matter of estimating land prices in violation of statutory procedures, please request legal correction. I have checked that land administration agencies have certain procedures for estimating land prices. Articles 239 to 243 of the Land Law and Articles 65 and 66 of the Land Law Implementation Law are detailed. Land prices are the standard for tax collection and are of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, when handling estimates, specialists must be appointed, and specialists must be appointed and qualified (Article 237 of the Land Law). It is by no means something that anyone can fabricate out of thin air. The land prices in this county have been announced by the county government in early this month. Except for the special zone that has not been fully announced, the farmland and residential land in each district exceed the market price by nearly double, and some are even more than double. When asking the people's representatives, they all said that they had never heard of it beforehand. Looking at the county bureau and the disclosure places in each district, there is no announcement of the colored price zoning map (Article 240 of the same law). According to the county notification, "I have checked that the land price zone standard land prices of each district, township, and township in this county have been estimated and completed by the County Land Administration Bureau, and should be announced separately in accordance with regulations." This shows that the announced land prices are only based on the estimation of your bureau, and have not been submitted to the county government for review, or to the people's representative agency for resolution (Article 66 of the Land Law Implementation Law). It is clear that since the statutory procedures have not been followed, whether the statutory calculation methods have been followed during the estimation, and whether the various amounts calculated have been listed separately and explained (same article), the county government and the people's representative agency, which are legally empowered to review and resolve, cannot know the details, and of course cannot be regarded as the standard land price. The method for calculating improper relief specified in Article 246 of the Land Law is based on the premise of a legal standard land price and cannot be applied to this case similar to the land price appointed by the emperor. The county government is busy with government affairs, or does not pay much attention to its review powers, and hastily issues an announcement. The people's representative agency, as the voice of the people, is not willing to give up its responsibility for resolution and has already fought for it according to law. Its presenters each have real estate and have a vital interest in whether the land price estimated by the Land Administration Bureau is appropriate. Now that the land price has doubled, the land price tax will inevitably be increased by one fold. When estimating, the people's right to resolve was deprived, and when taxing, the people's hard-earned money was exploited. They had no choice but to rise up in opposition. They urgently petitioned your bureau in joint names to handle the matter in accordance with legal procedures and correct the illegality of estimating land prices so that standard land prices can be produced. It is really for the public convenience. Sincerely presented, Li Xiuzhe, the presenter of the Songjiang County Second District Landowners, and the 5,065 co-signers, including Sheng Jiahuang, etc."

### The Severe Henan Disaster; Epidemics Resurge and Locusts Swarm Suddenly

Hopes for Relief are Especially Urgent

A telegram from Kaifeng states: Henan Province suffered a severe drought last year. Crops and trees withered, and there was no hope for harvest, resulting in an unprecedented disaster. Starving people were found everywhere, and there were cries of woe across the land. The disaster-stricken counties numbered over ninety in the entire province. Among them, the counties in western Henan suffered the most severe disaster. However, based on the current situation, it is difficult to distinguish between the most severely affected and the next most severely affected areas. It is only a matter of those who have already died and those who are about to die. The counties in western Henan have experienced disasters nine out of ten years. The land is barren, and the people are poor, lacking reserves. The early drought last spring destroyed the wheat harvest, leaving only twenty to thirty percent. Furthermore, there was no rain after autumn, and there was no harvest of grains and cotton seeds. The winter was also extremely dry, and the wheat seedlings withered and died almost entirely. So-called wealthy families now have empty pots and pans. The bark of trees and roots of grass have been peeled and eaten entirely. Now, they are even making cakes from stone powder as food, which is not only difficult to swallow but also causes symptoms such as body swelling and constipation. In various places, disaster victims have swollen faces like basins and bodies as thin as firewood. Many are collapsing by the roadside, moaning and waiting to die. Recently, diphtheria, cholera, typhoid, and other diseases have resurfaced. Reports of disaster victims dying from illness are heard daily. Although the Shanghai Charity Federation's Henan Drought Relief Office and the Henan Provincial Relief Association have distributed emergency relief in the spring, the disaster is too severe, and there are too many disaster victims. The small amount of relief funds each person receives can at most sustain them for ten days. After that, there is still no solution. It's like a drop in the bucket, unable to alleviate the current difficulties. Although some counties have received timely rain and have planted late autumn crops, many other counties have suddenly experienced a surge of locusts, and the autumn seedlings have been eaten entirely. Even in the areas that were fortunate enough not to be eaten, there are still two to three months until harvest time. In this long-term process, the cries of woe continue. Starving disaster victims often faint in the fields while wielding their hoes. Their suffering and hardship are increasing daily. At this critical moment of life and death, if further relief is not provided, not only will the vast majority of people be unable to escape death, but also the previous relief efforts will be in vain. Therefore, under these circumstances, it is especially urgent to hope that various charitable organizations will generously contribute to provide relief.

### Songjiang

Zhu Shaomei Arrested

Zhu Shaomei of this county, who formerly held a position as a military supply officer in a certain agency, embezzled over a thousand yuan of public funds. Zhu, fearing punishment, fled without a trace. It was recently learned that Zhu had secretly returned to Songjiang. On the afternoon of the 29th, the headquarters dispatched a platoon of soldiers to surround Zhu's residence. Zhu was captured on the spot and escorted to the district command for strict handling.

### Suzhou

Smuggled Opium Intercepted at East Station

At 0:57 AM on the 29th, when the Beijing-Shanghai No. 8 night express train arrived at the Suzhou station, railway police discovered a smuggler transporting opium. Two kilograms of opium were found on his person, totaling forty small packages. According to his confession, his name is Wang Wenxiu, 42 years old, from Xuzhou, residing at No. 4 Defu Lane, Sichuan Road, Zhabei, Shanghai. He intended to transport the opium to Baodai Bridge for delivery and then transport it to Zhejiang for sale. He was transferred to the police station that afternoon and then sent to the main bureau for interrogation.

### Changshu

Japanese Officer's Unsuccessful Tour

Commander Okawauchi of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces stationed in China, accompanied by Chief of Staff Takeda and a party of twenty-two, arrived in Changshu on the 28th in thirteen cars for sightseeing. Jia Wenbin, an inspector from the Zhabei Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, also accompanied them with a car attendant, Guan Xuesen, and acted as guides. When they arrived at the Changshu General Station, the local police had already received the news. Chief Inspector Hong Houchang led more than ten detectives and car patrol officers to the train station to inquire about the identity of the Japanese. It was stated that they were purely for sightseeing purposes and had no other intentions. As a result, because they had no passports, Inspector Hong advised them not to enter the city. The officers lingered near the station for twenty minutes and then returned to Wuxi in their original cars. The bureau immediately notified the police stations along the line in Liantang, Yangjian, and Wuxi to be vigilant.

### Jiangyin

Dramatic Increase in Land Tax Revenue

The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, considering that Cheng County's land tax arrears had accumulated to nearly four million yuan over the years, sent a clearing committee to the county at the end of last December to strictly urge payment in order to rectify the situation. In the past six months, revenue has increased dramatically. The total revenue for the province and county this year is over two million yuan, an increase of nearly one-fold compared to the annual assessment (over one million) and more than one-fold compared to the highest revenue in previous years (over nine hundred thousand). This achievement is unprecedented in many years. The reason is due to the improvement of the collection system and the effective urging of payment.

### Wuxi

Request to Suspend Wheat Business Tax

The county government and the Business Tax Bureau have successively received instructions from the Department of Finance, stipulating that from July 1st, wheat shops set up by each flour mill shall collect business tax from wheat sellers on behalf of the tax authorities. The tax will be levied at a rate of 0.5% based on a standard of four yuan per dan (a unit of dry volume). The Chamber of Commerce was immediately informed by letter to notify each flour mill and wheat shop to comply. Upon receiving the order, each factory stated that the flour mill's purchase of raw wheat flour had already been regulated by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with Article 1 of the Business Tax Law, and the Department of Finance had separately issued audit guidelines, which were circulated to various counties with strict regulations. Moreover, according to Article 9 of the Business Tax Law, business tax should be paid directly to the tax authorities by the taxpayers. How could the flour mills be ordered to collect tax on behalf of the wheat sellers? According to Article 25 of the Provisional Constitution, people are not obligated to pay taxes unless required by law. The flour mills pay consolidated tax and cannot bear this responsibility. Yesterday, special telegrams were sent to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, urging the Jiangsu Department of Finance to investigate and stop this practice in order to comply with the tax law and avoid double taxation. At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce was asked to appeal on behalf of the merchants, as the merchants of Jiangsu are in distress.

Wheat and Flour Prices Soar

Due to the impact of rain on the wheat in the surrounding countryside, the harvest is poor, and the wheat kernels are uneven in size. Rice shops in Beidang and Ximen Nanmen do not receive goods enthusiastically, receiving only about twenty thousand bags per day (each bag weighs 174.4 jin according to the city scale). Wheat from other provinces is rarely transported here. Recently, the goods arriving from Hexia are transported from neighboring counties such as Jiangyin, and the quantity is very small, insufficient to meet demand, causing market prices to soar. The price has risen to nine yuan and five jiao per bag. At the 5:00 PM tea party on the 29th, Hexia goods were priced at nine yuan, five jiao and five fen, and bank goods were priced at nine yuan and seven jiao. Flour mills in Shanghai such as Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, Lida, Xinda, and Xiangda have instructed their wheat shops in Wuxi to purchase in large quantities, purchasing over sixty tons per day. Due to a shortage of vehicles, they are transported to Shanghai by ship. The Shanghai Stock Exchange is also purchasing wheat in Wuxi, about one thousand bags per day, to be transported to Shanghai for trading. Local flour mills in Wuxi such as Jiufeng and Maoxin have raised flour prices due to the high cost of wheat. The market price on the 29th for Green Mountain and Green Battleship flour has risen to three yuan and nine jiao and five fen per bag. In the future, wheat prices and flour prices are expected to continue to rise without decline.

### Changzhou

Hengchun Pawnshop Rumored Arson

The Hengchun Pawnshop in Shijia Lane, Wuyi County, has been open for over ten years. The manager is Zhang Peishen. In normal times, its operation is among the best in the pawnshop industry throughout the county. Unexpectedly, on the 28th, many rural pledgers came to redeem their clothing and accessories. Upon investigation, it was learned that unscrupulous individuals were spreading rumors that the pawnshop would set fire to the premises, be robbed, and close down. The villagers believed it to be true and tried to borrow money at high interest rates to redeem their pledges. As of about 5:00 PM that evening, the pawnshop was still crowded. The pawnshop staff were extremely busy, allowing redemptions on arrival. Afterwards, they sent a letter to the county Chamber of Commerce to submit to the county government to investigate and arrest the rumor-mongering villains and to issue a notice to clarify the situation to prevent trouble from arising.

### Yangzhou

Collapse at Liuwei River Mouth

The Liuwei River mouth section of the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Motorized Military Road collapses many times every year. The collapses mostly occur during the summer and autumn when the river tide is high. Over the past decade, more than two English miles have been lost. It was previously discussed to follow the example of Nantong Tianshengang, organize a collapse prevention committee, and request appropriations from the central and provincial authorities to build water dikes to ensure that collapses do not continue to occur. However, the funds required are enormous and the work is difficult, making it impossible to accomplish in a short period of time. Unexpectedly, during the continuous moldy rainy season, the river tide rose, and the southeast wind blew strongly, causing severe erosion. On the night of the 27th, another ten or more zhang (a unit of length) of the Liuwei riverbank collapsed. All the houses at the river mouth were lost to the waves. Fortunately, there was a warning five minutes before the event, so no one was injured. On the morning of the 28th, land transportation between Zhenjiang and Yangzhou was completely cut off and did not resume until after 12:00 PM.

### Yuyao

50,000 Mu of Early Rice Flooded

Since the beginning of summer, Yuyao has experienced continuous rain. The Yaojiang River has risen to a high level, and small floods have occurred. Low-lying areas in the suburbs have become marshes. 50,000 mu of early rice have been submerged, causing widespread panic among farmers who are reporting the disaster to the county government. The county government has dispatched personnel to investigate separately.

Measles Spreading in Nanlan Township

Recently, the Nanlan Township area has been affected by abnormal weather. Measles is spreading rapidly in various villages. The number of children who have died from the disease is nearly 130. The severity of the situation can be imagined, with Yazhuang and Shilin villages being the most affected. Deaths are still occurring. The county government has dispatched physician Yang Taiji to conduct an on-site inspection and find ways to prevent and control the disease.

### Gaoyou

Wheat Prices Soaring Unabated

Wheat prices in this county are soaring unabated. When it first entered the market, it was only over six yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). It then gradually increased, suddenly rising five jiao on the 26th. Now, No. 1 Huxi wheat has reached nine yuan and seven jiao per shi, and Huxi wheat has also reached eight yuan and nine jiao. This is because flour mills from various places and Gaoyou shops are competing to purchase it. In addition, the harvest in this county has declined due to the impact of spring rain. It is not difficult to break through the ten-yuan mark.

Slaughter Tax Collected by the Business Tax Bureau

From the 26th fiscal year (i.e., from July 1st), all slaughter taxes in this county will be collected by the Business Tax Bureau. All brokers must exchange their licenses within the specified period and must not apply early or falsely.

### Qingjiang

Completion of Canal Embankment Slope Reinforcement

The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction has completed the east and west dike slope reinforcement project on the Liyun Canal. In addition to the Canal Works Bureau sending personnel to inspect and accept each section, the Provincial Department of Construction has also requested the bureau to send personnel to inspect and complete the acceptance.

Travel Correspondence

### The Reality of the Yunnan Opium Ban

— Geng Ya

Yunnan has always been known for its beautiful climate, so its products are extremely abundant. According to the Director of the Department of Construction, Zhang Banghan, the quality of various products is roughly as follows:

Yunnan is the richest in mineral resources, especially coal and iron. Almost all 130 counties and bureaus in the province produce coal and iron. In remote areas, there is even more. Iron ore is occasionally mined, but coal is abundant because the forest resources are vast and inexhaustible. Even if the coal seams are naturally exposed, few people pay attention to them. Other minerals such as tin in Gejiu, copper in Huize Qiaojia, silver in Ludian Shuangbai, antimony in Wenshan Pingyi, and arsenic in Menghua Fengyi have all been mined effectively. As for sulfur, nickel, gold, lead, zinc, and cobalt (one of the metallic chemical elements, as hard as nickel, blue-white in color with a slight red tint, extremely expensive, so it is rarely used in industry, only the lead powder made from its oxides has bright colors and is mostly used as pigments), there are also many producing areas. The output of each ore, except for tin in Gejiu, which has a long history of taxation and knows its annual output of six to seven thousand tons, is mostly mined by local methods, with simple scales and irregular mining. There are no investigated figures. There are also marble, crystal, cotton, gypsum, clay, alum, talc, natural alkali, and pigment stone, whose production is also uncertain.

Yunnan has more than 10 million mu of natural forests, producing pine, fir, cypress, chestnut and other timbers of inexhaustible benefit. Forest products for edible, medicinal, and industrial uses are also extremely abundant, such as tea, purple stems, camphor, sapium sebiferum, lacquer trees, tung trees, cotton, chestnuts, pine nuts, walnuts, ginkgo, longan, lychee, wood ear, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, bamboo ginseng, poria cocos, cordyceps, colored kapok (produced in Baniu Village, Mojiang County, with red, blue, and black colors, more vibrant than cotton thread sold on the market, but only a few trees, now trying to plant more), sanqi (perennial herb, externally applied to stop bleeding and reduce swelling, internally taken as a warm tonic), chicken fir mushrooms (a special product of Yunnan, more delicious than "MSG," Emperor Xizong of the Ming Dynasty loved this dish and set up a special post station to buy it to Beijing, only produced in a few counties such as Menghua and Chongming), tiger paw mushrooms (more expensive than chicken fir mushrooms, used in Yunnan's high-end banquets), as well as dozens of special medicinal materials such as cinnamon, whose annual production and sales are considerable.

In the past, the farmers of this province planted a lot of opium, but now they are determined to completely ban planting within this year, even if it affects the province's tax revenue, they will not hesitate. The province's revenue from this item is more than one million yuan in national currency per year, and there is a considerable certainty of how to make up for this. However, the economic losses of the people are very problematic, because the province's opium production reaches more than 40 million taels per year. Aside from the province consuming half of it, the remaining 20 million taels are transported elsewhere, which can be exchanged for at least 20 million yuan in national currency. Now that it is resolutely banned, the economic losses should be compensated for by other means. Opium is related to the value of Yunnan's import and export goods, which is very significant. The major import goods in Yunnan over the years, cotton banknotes and cloths, are worth about 20 million yuan in national currency; silks, satins, silk floss, medicinal materials, cosmetics and other sundries are worth about 10 million yuan, totaling 30 to 40 million yuan. As for export goods, tin ore is worth 17 to 22 million yuan, and mountain goods and medicinal materials are worth about 4.5 million yuan, totaling 23 to 4 million yuan. Before the opium ban, imports exceeded exports by more than 10 to 20 million yuan each year. After opium was replanted, this huge deficit was not only offset, but at times it even appeared to be a surplus. (According to the Yunnan Economic Commission, Yunnan's previous imports exceeded exports by about 2 million taels per year. Since 1931, it has become a surplus, reaching more than 11 million yuan in national currency by 1935.) Therefore, the old Yunnan currency, which was gradually declining, was able to maintain a relatively stable position due to the nourishment of opium. The deep relationship between opium and Yunnan's economy and finance is evident. Therefore, the opium ban compensation plan should first make the price of import and export goods balanced in a considerable period. However, among the current export goods, mountain goods and medicinal materials do not sell well abroad. Fortunately, tin ore can be exported in large quantities, so efforts should be made to increase its production as soon as possible. Other minerals such as tungsten, antimony, asbestos, and mica should also be actively mined to meet market demand.

Provincial Chairman Long Yun has also made some statements regarding the opium ban. He said, "After the opium ban, revenue has sharply declined. In the midst of extreme difficulties, we have prepared a compensation plan. Most of the mountain fields where opium was planted can be used to grow winter crops. As for other suitable plants, tung and cotton are the most important. Tung oil is an important export commodity in this province. We have designated 57 counties such as Yuanmou as tung planting areas. Each county has purchased 500 jin of seeds each autumn to sow. To promote cotton planting, we have purchased 30,000 jin of seeds from the National Economic Commission and distributed them to various official cotton areas for planting experiments. In addition, we have opened a machine spinning and weaving factory outside the South Gate of Kunming to use cotton grown in this province as raw material." Regarding the overall opium ban situation in the province, after the provincial government decided on a "three-year ban" policy and strictly implemented it starting in 1935, 85 cities and counties have completely eradicated opium cultivation. The remaining 44 counties that are strictly enforcing the ban will also be completely cleared by the deadline this year. Regarding the ban on smoking, there are 176,112 registered smokers in the province. Currently, there are many smokers undergoing opium detoxication at the Opium Detoxication Hospital in Kunming.

### Kawagoe, Carrying New Instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Okamoto Held a Dinner Party That Evening and Convened a Meeting; They Agreed to Visit Xu Shiying for Talks This Afternoon; The Dates for Going to Beijing, Heading North, and Going to Lushan Have Not Been Determined

Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe Shigeru, carrying new instructions from his Ministry of Foreign Affairs, came to China to return to his post. He arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday on the Japanese postal ship Asama Maru. Only Secretary Hoshida accompanied him; his family did not come. The ship berthed at the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu. At the time, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces and detectives from the concession police station were heavily guarded. Those who went to the ship to welcome him included Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying, Wang Changchun representing Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun, Zhou Jue, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Pengsheng, Treaty Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Huang Bode, Hu Mai, secretaries of the Embassy in Japan, and Kamimura, Chief of the First Section of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who came to Shanghai to meet him, Japanese Embassy Councilor and Consul General in Beijing Hidaka, Okamoto, Special Commissioner and Consul General in Shanghai, Shimizu, Chinese Counselor, Izumin, Director of the Information Department and Consul in Shanghai, Kicchu, Consul, Soya, Secretary, Kita, Military Attaché, Utsunomiya, Assistant Military Attaché, Honda, Naval Attaché, Okino, Assistant Naval Attaché, Kanoh, President of the Japanese Residents' Association, and Japanese leaders such as Funatsu, Buhe, and Yamamoto, totaling over a hundred people. After Kawagoe exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel on the ship, he declared that he was tired from the voyage and not feeling well. He went ashore and drove directly back to his residence on Bith Road. When the Chinese press corps met him on the ship and repeatedly requested an interview, he was ultimately refused. At 7:00 PM that evening, Consul General Okamoto in Shanghai hosted a dinner party for Kawagoe at his residence on Seymour Road to welcome him. All of Kamimura, Hidaka, Tajiri, Shimizu, etc. were invited to participate. A meeting was held on the spot. Kawagoe explained the process of returning to the country to seek instructions and the content of the new instructions. Hidaka and Okamoto reported on the general situation in China. Kamimura and Tajiri reported on their visit to North China. Kawagoe continued to summon Military Attaché Kita and Naval Attaché Hirata to discuss everything until late at night before dispersing. According to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, Kawagoe had agreed with Xu Shiying to visit Xu at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Xu told a reporter from the New Sound News Agency yesterday that the meeting with Kawagoe would be a private conversation and not a diplomatic negotiation. Earlier, when Xu greeted Kawagoe on the ship yesterday, Kawagoe first conveyed greetings from his new Prime Minister Konoe to Xu, saying that both the Japanese government and the public hoped that Ambassador Xu would return to his post soon. According to Shimizu, Chinese Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, Kawagoe will stay in Shanghai for several days before going to Beijing. However, it is heard that Foreign Minister Wang has decided to go to Lushan on the 2nd of next month, so he may not be able to meet him. The date for going to North China and Lushan has not been determined. The Japanese Embassy has rented a house in Lushan because the various ministries of the Executive Yuan of your country move to Lushan for the summer, in order to facilitate the contact business. In the future, they will send personnel there in rotation, but it is not a formal branch of the embassy.

According to the Central News Agency, observers of the current situation said that this return to his post by Ambassador Kawagoe may not be able to smoothly unfold the stalemate in Sino-Japanese diplomacy. This is because the negotiations that Kawagoe came to prepare for are only the so-called adjustments to trade, aviation, and the tariff system. Japan is unwilling to discuss the various issues in eastern Hebei and northern Chahar that China hopes to resolve. This can be proven by the remarks made by Ambassador Kawagoe to newspaper reporters in Tokyo before returning to his post. Therefore, the hope that the Sino-Japanese issue can be smoothly unfolded after this return to his post by Ambassador Kawagoe seems very slim.

According to the Dōmei News Agency, Ambassador Kawagoe, who had been in his country for about a month, arrived in Shanghai on the Asama Maru at 4:00 PM on the 29th to return to his post. He stated, "I heard that the Chinese side has regarded the remarks I made when I set sail from Yokohama as a problem. I think there is no lack of misunderstanding in it. What I felt deeply when I returned to my country this time was that China has gradually progressed to a modern country by modeling Japan's development, and this has become common sense among the Japanese intellectual class. The so-called re-understanding of China has also been fully popularized, and everything in Japan has continued to progress. I would like to ask people from all walks of life in China to fully recognize this. As for economic cooperation in North China, I will assist in various issues that are beneficial to China and do not harm Japan. This is our new hope. If it can be handled by discussing it with the local authorities, we will promote negotiations with the local authorities. When it is necessary to negotiate with the central government, we should consult with the central government. As for the so-called political adjustment of diplomatic relations, it is difficult to regard the atmosphere between the two countries today as appropriate. If the atmosphere between the two countries becomes good, it is by no means impossible to adjust Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. I firmly believe that there will be such a time in the future. It is the duty of politicians of both countries to make the atmosphere between the two countries good, so I hope that both countries will continue to make efforts. It is also expected that friction may occur in the development paths of China and Japan, but I believe that both China and Japan do not want to fight, so preventing problems before they happen is the task of politicians and diplomats of both countries. The Anglo-Japanese talks are about to begin, but they have not reached a specific stage. The Chinese issue should be included, but it has not been decided in what form. I plan to stay in Shanghai for two or three days and then go to Nanjing. I heard that Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui is scheduled to go to Lushan on the 2nd, so it may not be convenient to meet. However, there is no urgent matter at present, and there is no need to rush to talk. There is a villa for the embassy in Lushan. If there is an important matter, I will go up the mountain, but I do not plan to live there now. I plan to go to North China around July 10, but not specifically to promote economic cooperation. As for economic cooperation, what should be started with? People there know all these kinds of issues very well. I am only discussing with them."

### List of Candidates in the National Election Area of This City

General Office has Approved; 80 People including Du Yuesheng

After the representatives of the National Assembly in this city area were elected last year, they were reported to the General Office by the National Election Office of this city for record.

### Yang Hucheng Sailed Abroad Yesterday on a Mission

First to the US, then to England, Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, and other countries for over a year to study military, agricultural, and industrial affairs

Mr. Yang Hucheng, former Director of Pacification in Shaanxi, was ordered by the Military Affairs Commission to go abroad for inspection. Yesterday afternoon, he departed with his secretary Wang Linge, Yuan Weike, staff officer Fan Yunong, and Mrs. Yang and their son, a total of six people, aboard the Dollar Steamship Line's President Hoover. Details are as follows:

Departure Yesterday Afternoon

Mr. Yang, accompanied by his family and well-wishers, boarded two small ferries, Yue Bao and Zhong Hui, at 9:30 AM yesterday to cross the river and board the President Hoover. The ship set sail for the US at 11:00 AM. Those who went to the ship to see him off included Wang Luyi, representative of Control Yuan President Yu Youren; Li Hongwen, representative of Military Affairs Commission Vice-Chairman Yan Xishan; Yang Hu, Garrison Commander of Shanghai and Woosung; Wang Shaozhai, representative of Acting Mayor Yu; Du Bincheng, representative of Shaanxi Provincial Government Chairman Sun Weiru; Xue Xiudong, representative of 17th Route Army Commander Feng Qinzai; Deng Baoshan, Commander of the Provisional 1st Army; Li Zhigang and Han Weixi, members of the Shaanxi Provincial Government; Yan Zhuang, Supervisor of the Control Yuan; Zhang Youlun, also of the Control Yuan; Zhao Shoushan, Commander of the 17th Division; Wang Zhuoran, President of Northeastern University; Li Huchen, Advisor to the Military Affairs Commission; and Zhang Xiaolin, Mrs. Du Yuesheng, Wang Zhinan, Zheng Boqi, and former subordinates of Mr. Yang, totaling over 60 people.

Remarks

Mr. Yang made remarks to reporters on board, saying, "I have been ordered to go abroad for military inspection, but personally, I also intend to study industry and agriculture more, in preparation for developing my hometown in the future. I will go directly to the United States and will not stay there for long. I plan to stay in the US for two months, first to inspect agriculture in the provinces of North America, and then to New York and Washington to inspect military and political affairs.

### Shi Zhaoji's Speech on Good Neighbor Policy at the Annual Meeting of the American Alumni Association Yesterday

Fear is the most despicable psychology of mankind. I hope Japan will eventually realize this sooner or later.

The Shanghai Alumni Association of American Universities held its annual meeting at the American Club on Fuzhou Road yesterday (29th) at 12:00 noon. Representatives from various universities, including Hill Meek, Dang Lanya, Li Zhaohuan, Po Fook Keung, Chen Jintao, Hu Yizhang, Wang Yukai, Chuan Ruoyu, Xu Shaoming, and others, totaling about 200 people, attended. First, Chairman Hill Meek delivered an opening speech and reported on the association's affairs over the past year. Next, the treasurer reported on the association's financial situation over the past year. Then, the chairman was re-elected, and Yan Fuqing was elected as the chairman for the next year. Finally, former Ambassador to the United States Dr. Shi Zhaoji gave a speech entitled "Good Neighbor Policy." The original text is as follows: Today, when I speak to you about the good neighbor issue, I can't help but recall General Smuts of South Africa's remarks on the European situation. He believed that the tension between European countries was largely due to mutual fear. He said that the relationship between European countries today can be said to be completely driven by fear. Fear is the most despicable psychology of mankind, and today it controls the people of all Europe. Looking at the recent aggressive expansion of armaments by European countries, with swords drawn, there is a sense of precariousness, which is very different from the impression I got in the United States. The relationship between the countries of the Americas is getting better and better, especially the relationship between the people of South and Central America and the people of the United States. This has to be praised for the efforts of the United States to promote good relations. The governments and people of the Americas have always been deeply suspicious of the international policies of the United States. The United States has successively annexed Bao Geli Ge, interfered in Cuba's sovereignty, ruled the Panama Canal area, and its troops occupied countries such as Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Nicaragua, issuing orders without hesitation. All of these things cannot but make people suspect that the United States has no ambition to invade, and even express hatred for the Monroe Doctrine. Although this doctrine is ostensibly aimed at defending against foreign aggression and interference, it is actually a tool for the United States to dominate the weak, and because the United States has repeatedly stated that the United States is the sole responsible party for the Monroe Doctrine, and its scope and application are generally stipulated and presided over by the United States, it has aroused resentment. In recent years, the United States government has made great efforts to promote a good neighbor policy, not only in words but also in deeds, and has earnestly implemented it in both economic and political aspects. Therefore, the fear and suspicion of the weak countries of the Americas in the past has been largely eliminated. From a passive point of view, what this good neighbor policy shows is a declaration that no matter what happens in the future, it will never send troops to invade neighboring countries, and will withdraw troops originally stationed in South and Central American countries, and re-sign treaties with Cuba and Panama to adjust relations. On the active side, it is to sign reciprocal trade agreements with neighboring countries. At the opening of the American Peace Conference last December, President Roosevelt said in his speech on the United States' non-interference in the politics of other American countries: "We will never tolerate any aggressive acts. The people of the Americas and Canada have no ambition to invade, nor do they want to be invaded. We will cooperate with each other on the principles of freedom and equality to promote culture. This goal can be achieved by concluding friendship treaties." The reason why I quote the good neighbor policy of the United States is that I firmly believe that international relations can be adjusted and improved by an enlightened policy that combines words and deeds. At present, there is said to be no mutual suspicion between the countries of the Americas. Now that the relationship between the United States and other countries in the Americas is as described above, let me talk more about the relationship between Canada and the United States. The borders of the two countries are interconnected, but Canada has never had any fear of being invaded. However, the interests of the two countries are not completely the same, and conflicts have often occurred in the past, and sometimes the situation is quite serious, such as the war between Britain and the United States in 1812, when American troops invaded Canada twice, and the dispute between Maine and New Brunswick over the border, as well as the dispute over the Oregon border, the dispute over the Alaska border, and the Caroline affair (Canadian troops bombed and sank a ship in American waters). The people of the two countries also hated each other for fishing and otter hunting. Even today, Canada's commercial policy, which was decided at the Ottawa Imperial Conference, is considered unfavorable by the American business community, and the American tariff policy is also deeply dissatisfied with by Canadians. However, the Canadian people deeply believe that the United States has no intention of using force to oppress them. Although the border between the two countries is long, there are no troops stationed there. One hundred and twenty years ago, the two countries signed a treaty that they would never operate warships in the Great Lakes. The governments of the two countries have adhered to this agreement to this day. Therefore, in the relationship between Canada and the United States, there is no fear psychology that General Smuts spoke of. From the past and present mutual relations of the countries of the Americas, it can be seen that if countries can cooperate peacefully and sincerely with each other, all problems can be solved. There are many large and small countries in the Americas, and there is a large country standing among them. It is easy for bullying the weak to occur, but if the large country can implement a good neighbor policy, it can dispel the fears of the countries. What I have said above is not intended to praise the United States, but to make people realize that what can be implemented in the Western Hemisphere, why can't other countries imitate it, eliminate international fear and suspicion, and cooperate sincerely to ascend to the realm of world peace together. The above-mentioned points should be of concern to the people of East Asia. It goes without saying that the current Sino-Japanese relations need to be improved. We have always admired our Eastern neighbor's efforts to govern the country. Decades ago, Japan was still in the feudal era. With the advocacy of a group of enlightened people, it absorbed Western material civilization and leaped to become a modern industrial country. However, the great development of our country's millennia-old culture depends on its own people and its own talents. Stimson said that China cannot be controlled or driven by external forces. Its deep-rooted culture, with more than 4,000 years of history, can serve as proof, and its love of peace is a guarantee of peace in East Asia. I share the same hope as Stimson, which is that sooner or later Japan will eventually realize this. Japan's commercial and political relations are most closely related to China. To seek permanent benefits, it must use friendly and peaceful means. Military aggression cannot solve the problem. Once the suspicion between China and Japan is eliminated, and the good neighbor policy first implemented on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean can be promoted on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, it will open a new era in modern history, and it should be a matter of rejoicing and encouragement for the people of China, Japan, and the United States. Now I quote Stimson's words in his book "The Crisis in the Far East" to end. He said that all major problems of mankind can eventually be solved, but the solution should be based on the efforts of the sages of the past to show to future generations. Our only duty is to have firm faith and courageous spirit, and to make this transition period and this period of doubt as short and wonderful as possible, so as not to cause unexpected branches.

The Shanghai Banking Association held its 12th Annual General Meeting at its office on Hong Kong Road yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The meeting reported on the association's affairs in the first half of the year, approved the membership of Zhengming and other three banks, the replacement of representatives of nine banks including Dongya, and the final accounts of the previous term and the budget for the next term. Details are as follows:

Secretary-General Lin Kanghou and Secretary Gu Chengan attended as observers.

Chairman's Report

Chairman Wu Yunqi reported on the handling of the association's affairs in the first half of the year, saying, "Today is the date of the 12th Annual General Meeting of our association. Looking back, it has been almost six years since our establishment. These short six years have been the period with the most reforms in the country's economic policy. Starting with the abolition of taels and the use of yuan, including the promulgation of the Savings Bank Law, the unification of domestic bonds, the implementation of legal tender, and the recent implementation of income tax, the new policies are all closely related to the financial industry. The tasks are complex and the responsibilities are heavy, far different from the past. Fortunately, more and more colleagues from the industry have joined the association, which has invisibly increased the strength of our association. All the measures have gradually become sound. My colleagues in the association are deeply cautious about their duties. I hope that my colleagues present will provide guidance based on their observations. It is my great fortune. I will briefly describe the progress in the past six months as follows, and I ask the members present to observe it. The previous term's association affairs report only briefly mentioned the implementation of income tax. Now half a year has passed, and judging from the association's experience, it is the most complicated work in recent years. Income tax itself is related to the entire people, which cannot be compared with other taxes with a narrow scope. The banking industry not only needs to study the tax payment methods of its own industry, but also needs to fulfill the obligation of withholding taxes. At the beginning of the establishment, there was no basis to rely on. Although there were regulations, implementation rules, and various types of collection guidelines, the clues were complicated and the matter was not one-sided. It was difficult to drive the pen and the road was full of difficulties. The association deeply knows the close relationship of this matter, and entrusted the Banking Association to conduct preliminary research. During the winter of last year, it recommended the organization of an income tax working group of the fifteen banks in China to prepare everything. At that time, the Money Industry Association immediately appointed representatives to participate in the cooperation. The most difficult thing to handle when the tax was implemented was the third category of income tax on deposit interest. It was originally scheduled to be levied in October 25th. The association, considering that preparation took time and the procedures were rushed, reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval to postpone it to this year. The working group began to study it step by step. In the past six months, a total of fourteen meetings have been held, each lasting more than three or four hours. Other personal contacts and repeated discussions are more than that. The working group's work steps are to look at the urgency and prioritize them. First, the regulations, implementation rules, and various types of collection guidelines are studied in turn. The doubts about the regulations and implementation rules are related to legislation, and the opinions are drafted and sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to be submitted for modification. Other questions on collection are directly sent to the Income Tax Affairs Office for explanation, often to the second or third time, and it must be thoroughly understood before it is completed. In the meantime, some have been adopted and modified, or there are still some to be considered. The accumulation of volumes is full of feet, and there are still internal procedures of the industry. The surface seems to have nothing to do with the tax law, but in fact there are chain relationships. We have also formulated methods for consideration as far as possible. Together with all the solutions in the past, they have been successively notified to members and local associations, so that they know what to rely on. In the end, at the beginning of the establishment, there was not enough preparation, and the laws and regulations have also been changed. Therefore, in addition to the meeting minutes, there are still many outstanding cases, and it is difficult to have a consistent narrative for the time being. In total, with fourteen discussions and six months of contact, the work is not even half done. It can be seen how trivial it is, and the income tax on profit-making enterprises has not yet begun to be levied. The procedures are even more complicated. There is more work to be done by the working group. After the end of this year, the research will also have some clues. It should be compiled and printed as a special publication for reference. During the study of income tax, there was also a motive for levying inheritance tax. The Legislative Yuan sent the principles and draft regulations of the tax to the association, and asked for opinions. Although this case is not as important as income tax, it should also be considered. Therefore, it was handed over to the income tax working group for discussion. The most important opinion was to divide the principles of the tax into two types: gross inheritance tax and split inheritance tax. Because the relationship between relatives is close and distant, the tax payment should also be different, so as to show fairness and to be submitted to the Executive Committee for review and discussion, and to solicit the opinions of the banks present. It was just sorted out a few days ago and sent to the Legislative Yuan for selection. As for cases that are continuous with the previous term, such as the donation for the purchase of aircraft for birthday celebration, the banks in the association initially jointly recognized 10,000 yuan. Later, the actual number solicited in Shanghai was compared with the planned donation amount, and the difference was still large. The association, loving the country and not daring to lag behind, relied on the enthusiastic contribution of the banks present and continued to recognize the donation of 110,000 yuan, which has been paid in full. It is heard that the government will reward them separately in accordance with the regulations. The donation for the same nature of the Japan Sports Movement also reached more than 9,000 yuan, all of which was the salary income of the colleagues in each bank for one day, and was also submitted to the municipal government for collection and transfer. The case has been closed and is hereby reported so that all members know the beginning and end, etc., etc."

Approved Various Cases

After the chairman's report, the discussion began: ㊀ Approved Zhengming, Shanghai City, Zhonghe, and other three banks to apply to join the association as members. ㊁ Approved Dongya, Siming, Communications, China Farmers, Kenye, China Shiye, Tongshang, Nongshang, Guangdong, and other nine banks to request the replacement of member representatives. ㊂ Approved the final accounts of the first half of this year. ㊃ Approved the budget for the second half of this year. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.

The most severely affected counties include Pinglu, Ruicheng, Yongji, Yuanqu, Linfen, Yuxiang, Anyi, and Jiexian. The affected counties have organized the Hedong Relief Association, requesting investigation and relief from the provincial government on one hand, and recommending representatives to appeal to the Central Government and various circles in Shanghai on the other. Fortunately, considerable results have been achieved. The central government will allocate 100,000 from the Ministry of Finance for relief first. In Shanghai, an agreement has been reached with the Joint Disaster Relief Association of various charitable organizations to handle the Shanxi disaster in a coordinated manner with Sichuan, Guizhou, and Henan provinces. It is also understood that the Shanxi provincial government and various counties also plan to allocate 400,000 to handle emergency relief.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Radio Officers Request Improved Treatment

All Radio Officers of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Request that the Meager Salaries They Receive, Which Were Set More Than Ten Years Ago, Are Difficult to Maintain in Modern Life, and Because the Work They Perform Is Solely Responsible and Their Responsibilities and Duties Are Comparable to Those of Other Senior Crew Members, While Their Treatment Differs Greatly. While Deck and Engine Room Personnel Can Be Promoted and Receive Salary Increases, Radio Officers Have No Possibility of Promotion or Hope of Salary Increase, Remaining Unchanged for Years. Moreover, the Company Requires Radio Officers to Possess a Ship Radio Officer License Issued by the Ministry of Communications, Making Them More Qualified Than Those Who Lack Qualifications. As Qualifications Are Restricted and Work Is More Demanding Than Any Other Vessel, Successive General Managers Have Been Repeatedly Requested, and Because There Were Sufficient Reasons, They All Agreed, but Due to the Poor Market and Poor Business over the Years, Although Improvement Was Permitted or Regulations Had Been Drafted, Implementation Was Not Demonstrated. Now That the Market Has Become Prosperous Again, and the Company's Business Is Extremely Developed, the Previous So-Called Helplessness Has Now Been Defeated.

### Pudong Bank to Expand Pudong Agricultural Loans Next Month

Loan Amount Set at One Million Yuan Warehouses to Be Built in Xinchang and Other Places

The Pudong area is vast and rich in agricultural products. In the past, Pudong Bank has handled agricultural loans to help farmers avoid manipulation by merchants, such as price reductions and devaluations. Since the implementation of these agricultural loans, farmers have found it convenient. Recently, the Pudong gentry and businessmen have requested Pudong Bank to expand agricultural lending. The bank has cooperated with the Farmers Bank of China to handle this, and it can be implemented starting next month. Pudong Bank originally had two warehouses in Zhoupu, Pudong. Now, four new warehouses are being built in Xinchang, Datuan, Qingcun Port, and Gexing. The two banks have sent personnel to the above locations to survey the warehouse locations, and the warehouse styles have also been drafted. Construction can begin the day after tomorrow and must be completed before the autumn harvest. In the future, a joint warehouse will be established. The loan amount for the two banks this autumn has been set at 600,000 yuan from the Farmers Bank of China and 400,000 yuan from Pudong Bank, totaling 1,000,000 yuan. If necessary, the loan amount will be gradually increased.

### British Shipping Company Crew Members Improve Treatment

Successfully Resolved

The Shanghai Times reported that, according to Mr. Watson, joint secretary of the Chinese Seamen's Association and the Chinese Maritime Pilots' Association, the crew members of the Chinese coastal shipping companies requested improved treatment, and negotiations with Jardine Matheson and Swire have been going on for about six months, and now the goal has been achieved. It is heard that Jardine Matheson will no longer calculate the conversion of Chinese currency by converting to local currency, resulting in great losses to the deck and engine room crew members. In the future, it will be settled according to the market. In the past, Swire crew members' salaries were settled according to the market, and the rest was paid in Chinese currency. This system has also changed. It is heard that in the future, all will be paid in Chinese currency, which is equivalent to increasing salaries by more than 10%. In addition to increasing salaries, Jardine Matheson also promised to pay a maintenance fee of five years for those who have wives after the death of employees. Swire has been saving up for employee maintenance fees for six or seven years. Other companies, such as the Great Eastern Company, also have salary increases. However, British and other foreign crew members hired by Chinese shipping companies in Shanghai and other places are of course not related to this new change.

### Navigation Bureau Instructs Two Companies to Replace Ningbo Ship Captains

Before the Two Captains Are Reassigned, Xinjiangtian and Ningxing Are Allowed to Sail

China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ningbo Line's Xin Jiangtian Wheel and Sanbei Company's Ningxing Wheel collided in Zhenhai, and the two captains each refused to admit their mistakes. The Ministry of Communications has telegraphed the Shanghai Navigation Bureau to investigate strictly. The Navigation Bureau dismissed Xin Jiangtian Captain Yang Honglin and Ningxing Captain Pan Erxun at the same time last Saturday, and wanted to detain the two shipowners, and ordered the two companies not to be allowed to sail without replacing the new captain. Later, after the company requested another voyage, the Navigation Bureau agreed. Until yesterday, the two ships returned to Shanghai. The China Merchants and Sanbei companies were unable to delay the departure of the Ningbo wheel due to the incident. Now, an excellent captain has not been found for a while, and he is currently being searched for. Before a new captain has been found, may the Navigation Bureau be requested to approve and temporarily allow the two shipowners to maintain normal navigation? After consultation, the Navigation Bureau agreed to do so, but ordered the two companies to find and hire a new shipowner as soon as possible, so Xin Jiangtian and Ningxing were still able to sail yesterday.

### Various Places Have Responded to Not Buying or Selling Smuggled Goods

Xiamen Minnan Will Continue to Establish Please Send Regulations for Participation

The Shanghai Committee for Not Buying or Selling Smuggled Goods received letters from various places yesterday, expressing the Ning Should Resist Smuggling Movement. The original letter from the Xiamen City Party Department reads, since the prevalence of smuggling through secret channels has affected our people's livelihood and national foundation to a great extent, if we do not seek remedy urgently, we will inevitably plunge the country and government into bankruptcy. Your association has foresight, and in order to assist the government in stopping smuggling, you have promoted the anti-smuggling movement, and since its import, it has achieved remarkable results, which is admirable. This city is a town in South China, and should promote this movement to curb the root of smuggling. However, its implementation methods lack reference materials. Your association has been established for a long time, and each work plan has been carefully formulated. I dare to send a letter requesting investigation and immediate sending of a copy of the implementation methods, regulations, and other plans for reference, and I learned that the Wu County Federation of Trade Unions and Pingnan County have sent letters to the association expressing their response.

### Old Incident Twelve Years Ago Li Guojun's Son Was Kidnapped and the Contact Was Assassinated

Leaving Behind a Widow and an Orphan, the Li Family Has Not Provided Relief Chen Tao Is Now Suing the Court for a Pension

Li Shiquan, son of Li Guojun, former Guangdong Provincial Judge, grandson of Li Hongzhang, a high-ranking official of the late Qing Dynasty, currently residing at No. 3, Shanzhong Lane, Puzhong Road, French Concession, was kidnapped on December 29, 1925, when he lived at No. 4, New Chongqing Road, Public Concession. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of 100,000 yuan. At that time, Li's father, Guojun, entrusted his friend Chen Tao, a graduate of law and former county magistrate, to go to Nanjing with Liu Lushan, a bodyguard from the same place, to negotiate the ransom. Who knew that Chen and Liu were going to be jealous, so on January 9, 1926, Chen and Liu were successively assassinated by kidnappers in the Chinese territory of Luban Road and Xieshi Road. Chen's death left behind a widow, Tao, who is now 59 years old, and an orphan, Xiaonian, who is now 28 years old. At that time, Tao was heartbroken by the tragic death of her husband and suffered a mental breakdown. Coupled with the fact that the orphan was young and ignorant, she did not ask the Li family for compensation. However, Li Shiquan was eventually redeemed by his family, but the families of Chen Tao and Liu Lushan, who were killed by the kidnappers for negotiating the ransom for him, never received proper treatment. Chen Tao has endured the pain for twelve years, suffering and raising her son Xiaonian to adulthood. Recently, Chen Tao and Chen Xiaonian, mother and son, grieved the tragic death of their husband and father, and the Li family turned a deaf ear to their plight, which was against morality, so they entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Court's Civil Division against Li Shiquan, requesting an order to pay a pension of 8,000 yuan. The case was heard twice by Judge Li Liang, but the defendant Li Youquan did not attend, and the date was changed. Yesterday morning, the hearing was continued, and the plaintiff and her lawyer attended the court to state everything. The defendant was represented by a Tang, who made a statement and defense. The court found that the case was clear and ordered the debate to be closed, and the judgment was set for the 30th.

### Man Commits Suicide in the River After Losing Love

Photos of Men and Women Were Found The Male Photo Was Marked "Dai Dunrong"

At 1 AM yesterday morning, a young man dressed in a fake gray woolen long gown and yellow leather shoes suddenly came to the Bund Guangdong Road Wharf in the Public Concession. After wandering around for a while, taking advantage of the quiet night and no one noticing, he took off his long gown and white silk short gown, sighed deeply, and jumped into the river to commit suicide. In an instant, his body sank and disappeared. A dock worker, who was defecating near the boat, witnessed the tragedy but could not stop him, so he reported it to the Chinese police on shore, who took the deceased's two pieces of clothing to the Central Police Station. Inside the clothes pockets, a photo of a man and a woman and a handkerchief were found. The male photo was a two-and-a-half-inch half-body photo, about 27 or 8 years old. The back was written with ink and pencil "Dai Dunrong." The female photo was a four-inch full-body photo, about 20 years old, wearing a turn-down collar shirt, men's overalls, and a men's newsboy cap askew, looking lively and heroic. The back was written in ink "Dying for you," the handwriting was the same as in the male photo, indicating a case of suicide due to a broken heart. Because it occurred on the river surface, the Customs Water Patrol Police Station was notified, and Detective Gong Qingyun took the relics back to wait for the family to claim them. However, the deceased's body has not been found as of last night.

### Chen Baoxiang Sentenced for Defrauding Female Guides of Ornaments

It has been found that the suspect committed a total of nine offenses. He is sentenced to one year and two months imprisonment for habitual fraud.

Recently, there has been a group of unemployed individuals who specialize in renting rooms in various hotels and hiring female guides to come to them, devising ways to deceive them out of their ornaments in order to pawn them for money. Although the police have cracked down on several such incidents, these events still occur from time to time due to the clever methods of the swindlers. Chen Baoxiang from Ningbo is one such person. He usually dresses in Western suits and leather shoes, with an elegant demeanor, and specializes in defrauding female guides of their ornaments under the pretense of being a traveler. After the case was reported, Detective Wang Yingjie of the Old Zhabei Police Station arrested Chen. It was discovered that Chen had committed numerous offenses, totaling nine. Recently, it was also discovered that he used the same method to defraud Xu Jufang from Xujiacun, Meng Lijun from Taishan, and Li Guiyun from Hechun, all three being female guides, of their ornaments. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Chen Baoxiang to the Special Court for further interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted him for the crime of habitual fraud. Judge Ye Shengchao interrogated him and obtained a clear confession, sentencing Chen Baoxiang to one year and two months of imprisonment for habitual fraud.

### Conclusion of the Interrogation in the Hongchang Silk Factory Worker Riot Case

Sentencing Today

Lao Zhennan, the owner of the Hongchang Silk Factory located at No. 3, Lane 369, Kang Nao Tuo Road, West Shanghai, hired lawyer Wu Peng and filed a lawsuit in the District Court against Qian Zenggen, Wang Junming, Jiang Jinsheng, and other workers of the factory, as well as Qian Bajin, Bu Yinhuai, Xu Yacheng, Zhu Shengtai, Zhang Xiangtang, and other representatives of the silk weaving industry union in the Third District of Shanghai, for leading 30 to 40 members of the union into the factory at 8 PM on May 3rd, ordering the Hongchang workers to stop working, forcibly shutting down the motors, and destroying machinery and raw materials. They also went to the plaintiff's home, destroyed the front door, and threatened that the plaintiff must surrender himself, otherwise the union would destroy the entire factory. Later, as the plaintiff came and went, they gathered thousands of people and damaged the factory again. The Gordon Road Police dispatched a team to suppress the riot before it dispersed. Because the location was on a road built across the border, the District Court accepted the case. Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang investigated and prosecuted Xu Chan and the other thirteen defendants. Only Qian Bajin, Lü Zaiyue, Zhang Tianbao, Xu Yacheng, and others of the defendants were present at the continued interrogation by Judge Bai yesterday. They denied the destruction. The court debate concluded, and sentencing will be today.

### Selling Hand Looms by Mail to Collect Money from Other Places

Reported by a customer, investigated by the court.

Li Nanying, the manager of the Tangshan Road Commercial Advertising Company, and Wu Jiqun, an employee of the company, learned that there was profit to be made from reselling the hand looms produced by the Zhonghua New Method Weaving Society. Therefore, they used the company's name to place advertisements in newspapers, claiming that Type A machines cost 160 yuan and could weave woolen sweaters and trousers. They solicited people to purchase by mail from other places, requiring a prepayment of four corners for postage and five yuan for the price, in order to defraud them of the price of the goods. Li Xiangquan from Anhui saw the advertisement and raised 5.40 yuan. On April 19th of this year, he mailed the money to the company from Guantian Town, Jiashan County, Anhui. However, Li and others did not send the machine. Li sent several letters to inquire, but they ignored them. Li then submitted the postal receipt to the Shanghai District Court to file a lawsuit. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang investigated and found the facts to be true, and prosecuted Li Nanying and Wu Jiqun under Article 339, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Judge Wang opened the trial yesterday. The defendant Li Nanying did not appear, and only Wu Jiqun appeared in court with his lawyer Cheng Zhengping. Wu Jiqun stated that he did not deny receiving the 5.40 yuan, but that the hand looms were being sold on behalf of the Zhonghua New Method Weaving Society. The original price of a Type A machine was 5 yuan, and the wholesale price was 3 yuan. They received his money on April 21st, but the company did not have any goods. At that time, the Zhonghua New Method Weaving Society was also out of stock. It was not until May 29th that they received the goods from the society and had already sent them out. The court concluded the debate and will announce the verdict on the 30th.

### Russian Woman Victoria Accuses Husband of Abandonment and Adultery

Informal Discussions

### Begging for Disaster Relief and Tea Parties

— Wang Ruoying

This year's famine is not only extremely severe and tragic, but also covers a wide area, reaching as many as eight provinces. For example, in Shanxi, since the beginning of spring this year, the Hedong area in southern Shanxi has not had any rain, "the stored grain has long been eaten up, the new harvest is extremely poor, and cotton has not yet been planted." Compared with those who have no harvest at all, this situation is naturally a little better, but for those who are experiencing it, what unspeakable suffering it is!

Various forms of disaster relief movements are being carried out to save the suffering compatriots, which is naturally good. In order to allow the victims to survive at a minimum, the severity of the disaster is assessed to determine the order of urgency, which is also beyond reproach. However, the less severely affected areas should also be treated equally and provided with relief, which should not be forgotten. The reason why the disaster in Sichuan has become so severe is due to the lack of attention when it was less severe, and the fabrication of a false sense of peace. Moreover, the disaster in southern Shanxi is not light now.

Therefore, it is undoubtedly necessary to provide disaster relief to the Hedong area of southern Shanxi, and it is also appropriate to send representatives to the central government to beg for relief and to appeal to all parties. After begging for relief and appealing with results, I think they should return quickly. Not only should they return quickly to "handle association affairs," but also to console the long-awaited hopes of the disaster victims.

Before returning, while begging for relief and appealing, the representatives who speak for the victims should be frugal and thrifty everywhere, which I assume is a given. But I still cannot remain silent about tea party receptions.

When thinking of the tragic situation in the disaster area, we certainly don't need to be melodramatic and say things like "unable to swallow food," but based on human compassion, we cannot remain unmoved. Therefore, I believe that begging for relief and appealing, like "inviting the local press to a tea party to report on the progress of the negotiations with various parties," is unnecessary. The reason is simple: saving one penny is saving one penny, and "saving one more penny" is "saving one more life."

Naturally, if it is necessary to "report on the progress of the negotiations with various parties," it is necessary to invite the press or other relevant parties to the meeting. Is the report necessary? I am not familiar with the inside story and have never been a representative, so I don't know. Judging from the words, if it is only to report some progress and has no other purpose, then I think it is completely unnecessary. It is better to return as soon as possible, because the association affairs are urgently awaiting handling, and the victims are eagerly anticipating their return. If it is considered necessary to publicly report the "progress of the negotiations with various parties," then I think it is not necessary to have a "tea party." Finding a free place for everyone to talk is also possible, isn't it? The reason is still the same as above: saving one penny is saving one penny, and "saving one more penny" is "saving one more life." Especially since the organizers of this "tea party" are representatives who have come to beg for the victims, when they sit in front of a white table, smelling the aroma of coffee and refreshments, do they not feel unable to finish their meal when they think of the tragic situation in the disaster area?

If it is said that the convocation of this "tea party" was originally "for the sake of the invitees," then this is an underestimation of the "invitees." Because they have come to listen to the "report," they naturally have great sympathy for the victims; and those who come are not victims, and they will not come just to eat a few cakes and drink a cup of coffee.

### Old-Fashioned Landlord

— Yegao

"Don't mind the dirt, sir! Here you can do what you want without women and children bothering you."

The one who said this was a short, old man in tattered clothes. After I explained my intention and rented his house at the highest price, he led me into a dimly lit room with only one skylight. Although it was winter, the house still reeked of a pungent musty smell.

## Page 20

"This house hasn't been lived in for years..." I thought, but didn't say it. In fact, at this point, it was hard for me to express satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the house. Outside, snow was falling sparsely.

"What do you do?" He asked, sizing up my whole body and the hunting dog behind me.

"Can't you see: a hunter!" I said, pointing to the shotgun and the hunting dog, and was accepted.

"Are you suspicious? This house is lucky. My son and daughter-in-law used to live here..."

"No! I'm very satisfied," I said, and unloaded my things one by one.

In the evening, he occupied some wine and dishes from the small shop, and we sat facing each other in the house and drank. After drinking a few cups, the stern old man's face turned red, and his eyes were slightly drunk. He said a lot, starting with the season and the harvest, and then, in a sad tone, he spoke of himself:

"I, sir, am a worthless person. Except for those who want to harm me, no one respects me." He sighed sadly, "The farmers often scold me to my face: Uncle Gui Sheng, you are a miser, why aren't you ashamed? But why should I be ashamed? I live a good life. My son betrayed me. Three years ago, I got him a wife. Since then, they have been persecuting me together. When I'm not home, they search everywhere, break my door locks, and dig up the bricks under the ground. What for? Sir, think about it, just because they believe I have money hidden underground..."

"So you really hid money underground?" I asked with interest.

"Yes, but what does it matter to them? -- You old devil, we have no good food, no good clothes, but you hide a whole jar of silver underground, letting it rust and get moldy." They scolded me like this, but I ignored them. I believe that one day they will dig up all the foundations in my house, so when they were there, I didn't dare to go out of my room for a step. In the middle of the night, when they were all asleep, I would get up and count the silver. I was afraid that they would use magic to trick it away. Once when I was counting, I found that it had decreased. I believed that they had used magic to trick it away. I was very angry, so I drove them all out of this house..."

"Where are they now?" I called out curiously.

"Near the mountains in the village, sir. You will see them tomorrow when you go to the forest to hunt wild rabbits."

"Now you live alone in this big house?"

"Yes, I live alone. This way I can be much quieter. I can count silver during the day, and no one will hear it."

"Is that convenient?"

"Thank the Bodhisattva, everything is very good. You see, I'm not very old yet. I can still do things..."

After dinner, I retreated to my room. I prepared ammunition for a day of hunting in the forest tomorrow.

Snow was falling all over the mountains and fields. In front of the holy lamp, there was the old man's murmured prayer:

"Bless the old man, there is persecution everywhere!"

I wandered around the house in a daze.

### Sea Journey Notes (II)

— Li Xuan

A Group of Slaves to a Lost Country

Around seven o'clock, the reddish-brown sun hid in the west, the grey-blue sky reflected a dazzling red light, the sea breeze cooled down a bit, and the waves under the ship turned a lovely blue-green, the spray leaping like snow. There was no sound, nor a single star. The sky was dark. On the bow of the ship were three Vietnamese people. A man in his forties, since the ship was moored, he sat on the iron anchor reading. Next to him sat a woman wearing a wool coat, very young, and still a bit beautiful. She seemed to be looking at the distant horizon where the sea and sky meet. Sometimes the two of them would sigh softly. I guessed at their fate. Perhaps during the reign of the Nicholas Dynasty, they were the children of generals or counts. Now they are wandering to the East, consuming all their possessions in endless years. In order to withstand the irresistible hunger and cold, the man became a patrolman, bodyguard, or spy for the imperialists. The woman became a maid, dancer, and prostitute. With the arrival of summer, a group of aristocratic women selling their flesh would rush to Yantai to meet the Western sailors who wandered around the world. Now, with the accelerated "specialization" of Tianjin and Pingjin, a batch of White Russians raised by XX Japanese are pouring into North China, helping their shameless masters to arm and smuggle goods, or to run errands in drug dens and brothels.

Another short man, his mouth never leaving his pipe. He could speak a few incomplete Chinese words.

He leaned against the ship's railing until late at night, facing the sea breeze and smoking, always so melancholy.

The next afternoon, two guys in ill-fitting Western suits were speaking in a language I couldn't understand at all. They looked very much like Chinese, but the language was not a dialect of any province. I suspected they were XX people. After listening carefully, they were not speaking XX language. Coincidentally, two women also came from the stern, wearing the same hemp-stitched Korean clothes. The four of them were talking about a boat sailing away from us in the distance. At this time, a man with a Tianjin accent yelled strangely:

"XX boat, XX boat."

"No, no, Shengjing, Shengjing, British boat."

"Foreign boat! Faster than ours!"

"Shengjing is also foreign, not Japanese."

The Tianjin man asked them something in Korean, but they answered in Chinese:

"The tall ones are Korean, Korean."

The Tianjin man was very serious about them being Korean, and asked them what foreign company they worked for. They mumbled a few words, everyone laughed, and then dispersed.

### Dusk Outside the Fence

— Tian Qing

Southern summers are so hot that you want to soak in cold water all day to feel comfortable. However, in the office, in addition to fanning yourself a few times, you also have to work wrapped in sweat.

Being buried at your desk all day writing fills your brain with jumbled words, and your mind is confused by meaningless sentences. As soon as you move your eyes away from the paper, you experience a phenomenon of blindness. Although a room is so small, it feels too vast at this time, and even the things placed next to you seem to stand too far away! Almost beyond the reach of your eyesight. If you look at the scorching sun outside the window, it's as if you've been hit by tear gas, your eye membranes hurt, and tears stream down.

When it was time to get off work, it was almost dark. Not a trace of the sun's afterglow remained on the horizon, only the evening glow in the distant sky was still shining. I moved my very tired body and walked out of this man-eating machine. It was as if countless crows were flying in front of me, flying in a jumble... As soon as I stepped out of the agency's fence, a dark shadow in front of me stopped me. I used great effort to see clearly what this thing blocking my way was: after a long time, I saw that it was a very haggard child, barefoot, wearing a set of shorts and a vest that country children usually wear, but it was already broken and there was not a complete piece left. He was also carrying an old bamboo hat on his shoulder. He stretched out a hand to me, and seemed to beg me with a "Sir!" His cyan face was covered with the scars of hunger, and also revealed the shyness that is unique to children in the wilderness.

"What!" My eyes widened a bit fiercely, as if the frustration accumulated in the fatigue of work was about to be vented on this thing. This short two-word question immediately caused a terror response in the child's heart. He only repeated a softer "Sir!" and the outstretched hand also trembled slightly. This made me strange. At first I thought he was a small beggar, but now I felt that my judgment was wrong. Curiosity made me temporarily forget my tiredness and asked him about his family situation and why he was blocking people's way at the door alone.

My question was like a poisonous thorn piercing his little heart; before the words could even be spoken, his little eyes were already moist with tears:

"Sir, I have a home, a home in Xikou, ten miles away from here. My father used to be a farmer, and I also had a mother, but..."

"Then why did you run to the city alone? Do you have relatives?" I asked impatiently. I suspected that the child was lost or had been abducted by bandits.

"No, I'm here to find my father. He hasn't been back for ten days."

"What, does your father live in the city?"

"Yes, he's in the city, he said he came to the city to pull a rickshaw."

"Then where does your father pull a rickshaw?"

"I don't know, he, he hasn't been back for ten days! I'm hungry, I've been hungry for two days, and I can't find him..."

After dinner, the tape recorder in the section chief's office played the mawkish song "Drizzling Rain" again. Outside the fence, I faced this poor child, not knowing what to do. I wanted to walk away, but I couldn't.

But if I don't walk away, what can I do?
