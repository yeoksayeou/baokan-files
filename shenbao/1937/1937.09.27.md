### The Enemy's Attack on Jinjiawan Collapses, Our Forces Take Advantage and Recover Yong'an Bridge

The Enemy's Attacks on Jiangwan and Baziqiao are All Repelled by Our Forces; All-Day Artillery Battles in Zhabei and Pudong Cause Us No Losses; Our Dare-to-Die Corps is Active in Luodian, Inflicting Heavy Casualties on the Enemy.

The Enemy Forces Again Concentrated Firepower to Attack Our Liuhang, Attempting to Achieve a Central Breakthrough. Our Loyal and Brave Soldiers Engaged in Bloody Warfare, Fighting Fiercely with the Enemy for Days in the Jinjiawan Area East of Liuhang. The Enemy Soldiers Collapsed and Fled, and Yesterday Morning, Our Army Took Advantage of the Victory to Pursue, Engaging in Close-Quarters Combat. The Enemy Forces, Suffering Wounds, Fled in Disarray. Our Army Has Already Recovered Yong'an Bridge, a Vital Road Between Yanghang and Liuhang, Posing a Significant Threat to the Enemy Forces in Yanghang. Jinjiazhai, South of Luodian, Was Briefly Breached by Enemy Forces Through Our Warning Line Yesterday, but Our Army Has Implemented a Strict Blockade Using Solid Fortifications. On the Front Line of Luodian Town, the Two Sides' Sentries Are Only Three or Four Hundred Meters Apart, and Our Dare-to-Die Corps is Extremely Active, Inflicting Heavy Casualties on the Enemy. A Fierce Battle Erupted Once Yesterday Morning, with Our Army Killing Many Enemy Soldiers and Capturing Countless Spoils of War. In Zhabei, Baziqiao, Jiangwan, and Other Places, Although the Enemy Intensively Attacked with Artillery Fire and Tanks, They Were All Repelled by Our Forces, and Many Enemy Heavy Tanks Were Destroyed. On the Pudong Front, Although the Enemy Bombarded with Heavy Artillery All Day, They Did Not Dare to Attempt an Active Landing Due to Our Solid Defenses. According to Senior Commanders of Our Army, the Enemy's Fourth Wave of Reinforcements Will Arrive Successively, Numbering 40,000, Which is an Exaggeration. The Fourth Attack Is Also a Show of Force, as the Number of Troops Is Not Frightening at All. The Enemy Forces Rely on Aircraft and Heavy Artillery, but Our Morale is Brave, and Our Fortifications Are Solid. If They Want to Break Our Defense Line, They Still Need Infantry to Charge. The Enemy's Infantry Is Cowardly and Afraid of Death, and Without Exception, They Collapse and Flee in Disarray When Encountering Close-Quarters Combat. Our Army Has Strong Morale, and Charging in Close-Quarters Combat Is Our Strength, Which Is Why Our Army Has Absolute Confidence in Sustained Warfare.

### Jinjiawan: Our Forces Took Advantage of the Victory and Recovered Yong'an Bridge Yesterday

Posing a Significant Threat to the Enemy Forces in Yanghang

General Commander Speaks

The Enemy Infantry is Cowardly and Afraid of Death, Fleeing at the First Sign of Trouble; The So-Called General Offensive is Clearly an Exaggeration and Not to be Feared; We Have Absolute Confidence in Sustained Warfare.

From Luodian to All Stations South of Liuhang, a Fierce Battle Erupted the Day Before Yesterday. At Jinjiawan, East of Liuhang, the Enemy Attacked with Their Main Force, and the Attack Was Especially Fierce. That Morning, the Enemy First Bombarded with Heavy Artillery for a Long Time, Followed by Many Tanks Covering Infantry to Attack. Our Army Fought Bravely, Concentrating Artillery Fire, and Held Out for a Long Time. Ultimately, the Enemy Relied on Superior Weapons and Continued to Advance, and Were Temporarily Intruded. Our Army Temporarily Retreated, Until the Reinforcements Arrived in the Afternoon and Cooperated in a Counterattack. The Enemy Was Unable to Gain a Foothold, and After Our Fierce Attack, They Collapsed and Fled Immediately. We Immediately Restored Our Original Warning Line. Then, the Enemy Attacked Again, and the Fierce Battle Lasted All Day. It Was Lost and Regained Twice. Yesterday Morning, the Enemy Could Not Hold Out Anymore, and Our Army Took Advantage of the Victory to Advance and Recover Yong'an Bridge. According to Military Reports, the Enemy Attacking Our Jinjiawan Was the 18th and 68th Regiments of the Third Division.

General Commander Speaks About the Recovery Process

According to the Central News Agency, in the Liuhang Area, Our Army Recovered the Jinjiawan Position the Day Before Yesterday and Took Advantage of the Victory to Pursue. Yesterday Morning, We Recovered Yong'an Bridge. This is the Most Important Victory Message of Our Army in the Past Week, Which Was Told to the Central News Agency Reporter by a Certain Commander at the Front Line Military Station. The Reporter Set Off from Shanghai at 11:00 Yesterday Morning and Encountered Enemy Aircraft Three Times Along the Way, Flying Low in the Sky, Dropping Three Bombs Nearby, and Heard Machine Gun Fire. Fortunately, the Reporter Took Cover in Time and Was Not Harmed.

Enemy Infantry Flees at the First Sign of Trouble

According to a Certain General Commander, in the Past Week, There Has Only Been Artillery Battles on the Front Line, and No Enemy Infantry Has Been Seen. Their Fearful State Has Been Fully Exposed. Before Dawn the Day Before Yesterday, The Enemy Forces in Yanghang, After Heavy Artillery Bombardment, Suddenly Used a Large Number of Tanks to Cover Infantry and Attack Our Positions. The Jinjiawan Position Was Breached Twice, but When Our Reinforcements Arrived, They Launched a Fierce Counterattack While the Enemy Was Unstable, and the Enemy Soldiers Immediately Fled at the First Sign of Trouble and Collapsed. In the Afternoon of the Day Before Yesterday, After Our Army Secured the Jinjiawan Position, We Took Advantage of the Victory to Pursue and Recovered Yong'an Bridge Yesterday Morning. The Enemy's Casualties in This Battle Were Extremely Heavy. Yong'an Bridge Is Located in the Center of the Highway from Yanghang to Liuhang. After Our Army Recovered It, It Posed a Significant Threat to the Enemy Forces in Yanghang.

The So-Called General Offensive Is Clearly an Exaggeration

When Asked by the Reporter Whether the Enemy's Attack Was the Beginning of the General Offensive, The General Commander Shook His Head Repeatedly, but Stated That a Fierce Battle May Break Out Again in the Coming Days. The So-Called General Offensive Is Just a Show of Force by the Enemy. Regarding the Number of Enemy Reinforcements, The General Commander Stated That It Is Probably Not as Many as the 40,000 Rumored. However, No Matter How Many Troops There Are, We Are Not Afraid, Because the Enemy's Strength Lies in Aircraft, Heavy Artillery, and Various Heavy Weapons, Not Infantry. This Can Be Proven by the Enemy's Collapse in Every Battle When They Encounter Close-Quarters Combat.

Solid Position, Prepared for Any Contingency

Regarding the Enemy's Strategy, The General Commander Believes That They May Still Adopt the Plan of Attacking in the East and Striking in the West, Concentrating Forces, and Attempting to Break Through a Certain Point. However, Our Army Is Proceeding Step by Step, and Our Position Is Solid, Which Cannot Be Completely Destroyed by the Enemy's Artillery Fire. Even If the Enemy Breaks Through at a Certain Point, When Their Infantry Advances, Our Army Can Still Launch a Pincer Attack. This Is Our Strength. The Enemy Has No Choice but to Collapse and Flee Except Being Annihilated. Therefore, Although the Battle Line Is Long, Our Army Will Never Be Cut Off. The General Commander Has Absolute Confidence in the Sustained War. Regarding Other Front Line Positions, He Said That There Is Still No Change on Both Sides.

### Our Army Artillery Destroys Enemy Tanks

From the Afternoon of the Day Before Yesterday, The Enemy Repeatedly Bombarded Our Entire Money Front Line in Liuhang Dachang with Heavy Artillery, Ceaselessly Throughout the Night. Yesterday Morning, Their Artillery Fire Gradually Shifted Southward, Concentrating on the Jiangwan Area. Then, the Enemy Used Many Tanks, Followed by Infantry, to Attack. After Our Counterattack, They Ultimately Failed. The Enemy Then Transported Many More Heavy Tanks, Which Were Deployed on Xiangyin Road and Sanmin Road. Many Were Destroyed by Our Landmines and Artillery. The Enemy Has Completely Failed.

The Enemy Was Unusually Active in the Jiangwan Road Area the Day Before Yesterday, Repeatedly Attacking Northward. After Repeated Failures Due to Our Dense Machine Guns, The Enemy Bombarded with Naval Artillery, but Our Defensive Works Are Extremely Solid, and the Losses Were Minimal Except for the Destruction of Several Civilian Houses.

### Enemy Attack on Jiangwan Road Defeated

After the Enemy Forces Attacking Our Chih Chih University Were Repelled Yesterday Morning, Our Army Also Opened Fire on the Enemy Forces Positioned in the Patriotic Girls' School at 5:00 PM, and Sent Troops from the Qujia Bridge and Guangdong Middle School to Approach the Warning Position. The Enemy Forces Were Extremely Panicked. The Enemy Marines Headquarters in North Sichuan Road Sent More Than Ten Tanks to Cover the Infantry's Attack on Jiangwan Road. Both Sides Exchanged Heavy Artillery Fire. Around 7:00 PM, Our Army Returned to the Shuidian Road Position and Opened Fire on the Enemy Tanks, Inflicting Heavy Casualties on the Enemy, and then Retreated to Defend the Trenches. At 10:00 PM, the Two Sides Were Still in a Stalemate.

At Around 6:30 Yesterday Morning (26th), About Three Companies of the Enemy in the Downtown Area Attacked Our Xiangyin Road Sports Association Road Front Line. Our Army Waited in Full Battle Array, and When the Enemy Approached, Our Army Immediately Responded with Machine Gun Teams and Sent Some Infantry to Outflank From Hejia Lane. The Enemy Was Panicked and Fought Fiercely With Our Army for Two Hours. The Enemy Could Not Hold Out and Retreated Towards the Downtown Area.

### Fierce Battle in Luodian Yesterday Morning

Enemy Forces Abandon Their Armor and Flee, Suffering Heavy Losses; The Defense of Liuhang is Tight, and the Area is Quiet.

Our Newspaper Reporter Met Last Night with a Certain Senior Official Who Had Just Arrived in Shanghai from Liuhang. According to Him, the Battle Situation Between Luodian and Liuhang Is Quite Detailed. What Can Be Disclosed is Recorded Separately as Follows: 1. The Defense of Liuhang is Undertaken by Our Department. Although Enemy Aircraft and Enemy Ships Are Constantly Reconnoitering Outside the Port and in the Air, Attempting to Land, Our Side Has Strong Forces and Strict Precautions. As of Now, The Enemy Has Consistently Had No Chance to Take Advantage of, So The Area Is Quite Quiet. 2. On the Luodian Side, the Enemy's Front Line Starts From North of Luodian Town, Along Changqiao Fengzhai to About Two Kilometers North of Caowangfu, and Is Extremely Close to Our Army's Front Line. The Farthest Distance Is Only Three or Five Hundred Meters. Therefore, Enemy Aircraft Also Lost Their Bombing Power. In Luodian Town, the Two Sides Faced Each Other Across the Gushun River. From the Luodian to the Zengwangfu Line, Except That the Enemy Once Attacked Our Caowangfu Position on the 22nd and Was Painfully Defeated, They Have Not Dared to Attack in Recent Days. However, After Dawn Today (26th), Suddenly About Two Companies of Enemy Soldiers Attacked Our Position Frontally From Changqiao. Our Frontal Guard Immediately Pretended to be Defeated and Retreated, Luring the Enemy Deep. The Enemy Did Not Realize They Were Being Tricked and Rushed In. At This Time, The Left and Right Hidden Teams Brave and Took Advantage of and Bombed the Back and Side of the Enemy Forces With Hand Grenades, While Our Frontal Guard Immediately Counterattacked. Under the Painful Attack of Our Three-Sided Encirclement, The Enemy Forces Abandoned Their Weapons and Fled in a Panic. The Shape Was Unprecedented, Because the Enemy Forces Were Afraid of Death, and It Had Reached the Extreme. At That Time, An Officer, Because He Was Wearing Long Leather Boots, and It Was Slippery and Difficult to Escape, He Took Off His Boots and Fled Barefoot. In This Battle, Dozens of Enemy Soldiers Were Killed by Us, and More Than Thirty Branches of Step Eaves Were Seized, More Than Ten Small Flags, Two Radios, and a Pair of Long Leather Boots. 3. Although Luodian North to Shidongkou Is Controlled by the Enemy Forces, The Roads There Are Narrow and Transportation Is More Difficult. Currently, All the Enemy's Heavy Weapons, Such as Heavy Artillery, Field Artillery, and Tanks, Are Transported Via the Baoluo Highway From Baoshan to Yuepu, and the Maiyang Highway From Wusong to Yanghang. In Recent Days, The Enemy Forces Have Also Concentrated Their Forces on the Luodian Liuhang Line, Using a Central Assault Strategy. They Have Been Miserably Defeated Many Times, but According to Reconnaissance Reports, The Enemy Is Increasing Troops to That Line, and It Can Be Seen That They Have Not Abandoned Their Original Plan.

From 6:00 PM the Night Before Last to 8:00 AM Yesterday Morning (26th), The Enemy Artillery in Hongkou Fired on Our Baziqiao Position With Extremely Fierce Firepower. At Dawn This Morning, The Enemy Also Attacked Our Position There With One Company. Our Guarding Troops Responded By Surpassing and Engaging Them, and the Enemy Could Not Hold Out and Retreated. At Around 11:00 AM, Enemy Aircraft Dropped Bombs on Baziqiao. Our Army Returned Fire With Anti-Aircraft Guns and Anti-Aircraft Machine Guns, and the Enemy Aircraft Hastily Fled. At 10:00 AM, The Enemy Force Invaded Our Army, and After About An Hour of Resistance, All Enemy Troops Were Repelled.

The Enemy Forces in the Baziqiao Area Were Active Again Yesterday Afternoon at 2:00 PM, Reconnoitering in the Sky. Our Army Remained Hidden and Did Not Move. A Company of the Enemy Then Advanced From the Japanese Cemetery. Our Vanguard Troops Waited for the Enemy to Approach and Immediately Made a Feigned Attack on the Flower Cluster and Sent Troops to Meet Them. Our Former Commanders Came Out to Meet the Attack, and an Outpost Battle Occurred. The Enemy Forces Could Not Hold Out and Collapsed. No Major War Has Yet Begun on This Line.

### Jinjiazhai Briefly Breached

The Enemy Southeast of Luodian Fiercely Attacked Our Forward Warning Line at Jinjiazhai From the Night Before Last. Our Army Responded Calmly, but Because the Enemy Forces Were Numerous and Approached Fiercely, Their Chen Line Was Breached. A Thousand Enemy Soldiers Took the Opportunity to Cross the Di River Near Yangjiadu, Approaching Jinjiazhai, Hoping to Cut Off Our Shanghai-Taicang Highway Traffic. Currently, Our Fresh Troops Have Arrived and Are Strictly Blocking Them, Fighting Fiercely With the Enemy. South of Liuhang, the Enemy Used Fifteen Tanks the Day Before Yesterday to Cover Infantry and Peer at Our Yangjiufang Area Position. However, After Our Strong Artillery Fire Was Concentrated, They Soon Collapsed and Retreated.

### All-Day Artillery Battle in Zhabei Again Yesterday

In Recent Days, The Artillery Battle in Zhabei Has Been Very Fierce. Yesterday Morning at About 8:00 AM, The Enemy in the Downtown Area Again Used Heavy Artillery to Fiercely Bombard Our Position. Our Army Often Immediately Opened Fire to Respond. For a Time, The Sound of Artillery Was Very Dense. After About Two Hours of Fierce Fighting, The Artillery Bombardment Gradually Thinned Out at More Than 10:00 AM. After 1:00 PM in the Afternoon, The Enemy Attacked Again. The Rumble Was Dense, and the Momentum Was Even More Fierce. At the Same Time, The Enemy in the Jiangwan Road, 63 Garden, and Baziqiao Areas Took Advantage of the Momentum to Rush Our Position. Our Army Then Swept the Area With Heavy Machines and Artillery. The Enemy Suffered Injuries and Retreated. However, The Heavy Artillery Still Recklessly Bombed. Our Army Also Used Heavy Artillery to Return Fire Until Evening. The Enemy Forces Attacked Our Position About Ten Times Throughout the Day, but They Were All Repelled by Our Army Shaking Machine Guns. The Enemy Forces Fired About 200 Shells Throughout the Day, but They Were All Aimless, So Our Army Suffered No Losses. Our Side Fired About 100 Shells, All of Which Landed in Important Areas Such as the 63 Garden, Baziqiao, Japanese Cemetery, Jiangwan Road, North Sichuan Road Enemy Headquarters, Arili Japanese Elementary School, and Japanese Navy Training Ground. Therefore, The Enemy Forces Suffered Extremely Heavy Casualties. When The Enemy Forces Attacked Our Position, Our Army Also Leapt Out of the Battlefield and Engaged the Enemy in Close Combat Many Times. Many Enemy Soldiers Were Killed.

### Enemy Destroyer Captain Severely Injured

According to the Central News Agency, this is a broadcast report from Tokyo at 3:00 PM on the 25th. It Is Said That Prince Fushimi Hiroyoshi, Son of Navy Minister Fushimi, A Navy Captain, Was Leading a Destroyer in Shanghai and Was Hit and Injured by Our Artillery When He Attacked Pudong on the 24th.

### A Senior Military Officer Discusses the Battle in Luodian by Our Forces

Battalion Commanders Liu and Zhan Sacrificed Heroically; Our Dare-to-Die Corps Inflicted Heavy Casualties on the Enemy.

The Battle Situation Around Zengwangmiao, Northwest of Luodian, Has Been Quite Silent in Recent Days. The Enemy Is Stubbornly Guarding in Full Battle Array. Our Division Formed Several Dare-to-Die Corps, Who Advanced Stealthily the Night Before Last and Operated in the Enemy's Position at Changqiao Fengzhai. Rising and Falling, Miraculous and Unpredictable, The Enemy Was Caught Off Guard and Suffered Heavy Casualties. At The Time, We Intercepted an Enemy Wireless Machine, More Than Ten Small Team Flags, 30 Guns, and Many Telescopes. After The Enemy's Three Failed Attacks on Luodian, In View of the Great Strength of Our Resistance, They No Longer Dared to Advance Rashly. Yesterday, A Reporter Met With a Senior Military Officer of a Certain Division, Who Told Him in Great Detail About the Situation After the Money Operation. According to Him, The Division Was Ordered to Undertake the Defense of the Front of the Jialuo Highway and Had Inflicted Heavy Casualties on the Enemy Several Times. In the Struggle for Changqiao Several Times, One Enemy Colonel Was Killed, And Thousands of Enemies Were Annihilated. After the Enemy's Heavy Casualties, They Dared Not Invade Easily. The Division Has Been Resisting for More Than a Month. In Order to Capture Luodian, Battalion Commanders Liu Zhenwu and Zhan Wen Took the Lead and Fought Loyally and Bravely, Making Heroic Sacrifices. Soldiers Also Had Considerable Casualties, but the Existing Position Is Extremely Solid. The Enemy Repeatedly Bombed With Aircraft and Heavy Artillery, but It Was Not Destroyed. The Morale Is Strong, and We Are Waiting for Orders to Attack. He Also Said That The Enemy's Operation Has a Certain Method. Every Time, They First Fiercely Bombarded With Aircraft and Heavy Artillery, Followed By Infantry in a Cone Formation. When Our Side Sees Through Their Formation, We Immediately Sweep the Enemy With a Crossfire Net. The Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses Every Time. Our Army's Night Raids Are Even More Effective. When The Enemy Bombards With Artillery Fire, We Immediately Order a Quick Move Back. As Soon As The Artillery Stops, We Predict That the Enemy Infantry Will Advance to a Considerable Location, and We Will Leap Forward and Rush. Therefore, Southwest of Luodian, Every Battle Often Inflicts Unexpected Losses on the Enemy.

### The Enemy's Plot to Land in Pudong Is Very Urgent, and There Is a Fierce Artillery Battle Between the Two Sides

Artillery Fire Has Been Incessant for the Past Two Days; An Enemy Transport Ship Was Hit by Our Forces.

After The Enemy's Selected Attempts to Cross to Pudong Failed, There Were Rumors in Recent Days That a Large-Scale Attack Was About to Be Launched, but In Recent Days, Under the Strict Precautions of Our Army, No Violent Action Has Occurred So Far. Unexpectedly, The Number of Enemy Ships Suddenly Increased From the Pudong Surface of Mitsubishi Wharf to the Bottom of Yangshu Yong in the Forenoon. In Addition to Transport Ships and Red Cross Ships, There Were a Total of More Than 20 Warships Gathered on the Pudong Surface, Extending About Ten Miles. The Positions of Each Ship's Artillery Have Been Aimed at Pudong. Our Army Reported That it Would Alert the Entire Riverfront Front Line and

Wait in Full Battle Array

The Situation Suddenly Became Extremely Tense. Afterward, Enemy Ships Only Intermittently Opened Fire After Noon. At About 3:00 PM, 13 Enemy Aircraft Came in Formation, Perpetrating Chaos Continuously in the Areas of Qichang Warehouse, 18 Rooms, Yangjing, Zhangjialou, Yangjiadu, Shenjia Alley, and Pudong Avenue, Bombing Back and Forth. By 6:00 PM in the Evening, It Was Estimated That No Less Than 70 or 80 Shells Had Been Dropped. Most of the Shells Fell in the Fields. In addition to a Few Houses Being Affected and Destroyed, There Were No Major Losses. At the Same Time, Each Enemy Ship Also

Opened Fire and Bombarded

From 4:00 PM, It Is Estimated That One Shot Was Fired Every Minute, Continuing for About a Hundred Shots Until the Artillery Fire Thinned Out at About 6:00 PM in the Evening and Stopped at 7:15. Afterward, It Was Quiet for About Four Hours. At About 11:00 PM, It Was Time for Our Air Force to Fly to Shanghai for a Night Raid. In Addition to Firing Their Anti-Aircraft Guns and Machine Guns in Panic, The Enemy Ships Were Deeply Afraid That Our Pudong Garrison Would Take the Opportunity to Attack and Again Fiercely Bombed Our Position With Heavy Artillery! Our Army Believed That the Opportunity Had Come, So It Fired Heavy Artillery to Return Fire,

Echoing Through the Clouds

The Houses Were All Shaken, and Our Shells Fell in the Enemy Forces Position Around Yangshupu. The Fierceness of the Artillery Battle Was the First Since the Start of the War in Pudong. At Midnight 12:00, Four Enemy Boats, Full of 60 or 70 Soldiers, Approached and Dispersed at the Pudong Chunjiang Pier Under Intense Artillery Fire, Using Machine Guns to Sweep the Shore. At the Same Time, Two Enemy Ships Assisted With Heavy Machine Guns. Our Machine Gunner Guarding the Pierhead Displayed His Divine Skills, Resisting Warships on One Side and

Fiercely Returning Fire

The Enemy Soldiers Were Completely Cut Off From Advancing. After About Ten Minutes of Fighting, The Enemy Soldiers Suffered Casualties and Could Not Hold Out and Were Defeated. Seeing That Their Plan Had Failed, The Enemy Ships' Artillery Fire Thinned Out and Stopped. When Our Air Force Went to Bomb Again at About 1:00 AM, The Enemy Ships Densely Bombed Pudong Again. Our Artillery Also Returned Fire. For a Time, The Rumble Decreased at About 2:00 AM. Afterward, The Artillery Fire of Both Sides Was Intermittent. At About 4:00 AM, A Fierce Artillery Battle Broke Out Again. The Enemy Warship Misrepresented Our Position in the Rear, Fiercely Fighting Until About 5:00 AM. Two Enemy Boats Came to the Chunjiang Pier Again, Attempting a

Second Sneak Attack

to Land. Our Army Still Used Machine Guns to Sweep, and the Sound of Shooting Was Exceptionally Crisp. The Enemy Boats Knew That Our Defense Was Tight and Difficult to Invade. Under the Intense Pressure of Our Guns and Ammunition, They Speedily Escaped. However, The Enemy Ships' Artillery Fire Fiercely Bombarded Until 6:30 in the Morning Before Stopping. After This One Night of Intense Battle in Pudong, A Reporter Set Out at 8:00 Yesterday Morning to Investigate and Saw That the Buildings Along Pudong Were Still Intact. The Enemy Ships' Shells Were

Aimless

The Shells Were All Two or Three Hundred Shells and Fell in the Fields at the Junction of ××. Our Army Was Not Damaged At All. However, When Enemy Aircraft Dropped Bombs and Bombed the Area in the Evening of the Day Before Yesterday, Four Farmers Who Were Harvesting Rice Near Maojiazhai Were Killed and One Was Injured. Zhang Zhangshi, a Woman Who Was Injured by Bombing in Zhangjialou, and Pu Mingming, a Man, Were Not in Life-Threatening Danger. Also, Yesterday Morning at About 11:00 AM, Enemy Ships Opened Fire on Our Pudong. The Aim Was Not Accurate At All, and Our Side Was Not Damaged. The Enemy Ships Soon Stopped Opening Fire Too.

Ignored

From 1:00 PM Yesterday Afternoon, Our Side Consumed a Large Number of Shells Again, Constantly Bombarding Pudong. The Sound of Artillery Was Sometimes Dense and Sometimes Thin, and They Occasionally Swept Each Port With Heavy Machine Guns. Two Enemy Aircraft Also Ascended Into the Air to Reconnoiter. Our Army Understood Their Strategy and Retaliated With Heavy Artillery One or Two Shots, and Then Ignored Them. Seeing That It Was Difficult to Invade, The Enemy's Bombardment Thinned Out at About 4:00 PM, and Only One Shot Was Fired Every Few Tens of Minutes. Our Heavy Artillery Was Not Damaged.

Hit the Enemy Warship

Yesterday, A Certain Barges Old Man, Who Was Discharging Foreign Merchants Goods in Yangshupu, Accurately Reported to the Reporter That Yesterday Morning, He Saw a Destroyer of the Third Team Number of Japan, Seemingly Entering the Huangpu River From Wusong, and Was Hit by a Cannonball of Our □□ Artillery. The Tail of the Ship Was Badly Damaged and the Leaves Could Still Barely Sail. It Arrived in Front of the Huishan Pier and Used the Tail to Lean Against the Pier. Soon, A Large Number of Workers Carrying Goods Went On Board, and The Dead and Wounded Soldiers Inside the Ship Were Carried Onto the Pier One After Another. Four People Were Carrying a Person Who Seemed to Be an Officer, and Two People Were Carrying a Person. There Were About a Dozen People.

### Enemy Airfield Sees Ammunition Exploding

According to Dagong News, When Our Brave Air Force Came to Shanghai to Bomb the Enemy Forces Position the Night Before Last, We Heard That Two Shells at the Enemy Airfield Near the Public University Textile Factory Caught Fire. Three Aircraft Were Burned on the Spot, And the Ammunition Depot Was Also Affected. Therefore, The Enemy's Losses Were Extremely Heavy. Yesterday (26th) Morning Around 8:00 AM, Three Enemy Aircraft Were Distributed in the Low-Altitude Reconnaissance in Western Shanghai, Southern Shanghai, and Pudong, Circling Back and Forth for a Long Time, Occasionally Sweeping the Buildings. Around 10:00 AM, They Returned to Calm. Another Aircraft Dropped Several Shells in the Sky Over Zhabei, Destroying Only a Few Civilian Houses.

### Enemy Forces Lie About the Number of Casualties

According to Zilin Bao, A Japanese Military Spokesman in This Port Officially Announced to Foreign News Interviewers Yesterday That The Japanese Army in Shanghai Had Died a Total of 1,412 People and Injured 4,169 People From the Start of the War to September 21. Zilin Bao Analyzed That the Total Number of Casualties Declared Last Time Up to September 13 Was Higher, Which Slightly Indicated That the Battles in Recent Days Were Much Fiercer Than Before. The Number of Deaths Last Time Was Only 905, and The Number of Injuries Was 2,574. In Other Words, The Total Number of Deaths in Eight Days Exceeded More Than Half of the Number of Deaths in Twenty-One Days, and The Number of Injuries Was 1,595. According to the Mainland News, The Total Number of Casualties Announced by the Japanese Army Authorities Only Refers to the Japanese Army. The Losses of The Japanese Navy and Marine Corps Are Not Included. Furthermore, The Deaths of Japanese Soldiers Suffering From Cholera Were Not Included. Translator's Note: The Unreliability of This Total Number of Casualties Can Be Known by Any Eye. The Translator's Translation and Publication in the Newspaper Is Only to Make Clear the Fierceness of the Front Line Battles in Recent Days.

### Enemy Transports Unload Munitions

In recent days, the transport ships carrying the enemy's fourth reinforcement army to Shanghai have successively sailed back to Japan on the previous two days. Currently, those remaining in Shanghai are all for carrying munitions and military supplies, totaling four ships. Two ships are docked at the Huangpu Wharf, named the Sixth Unkai Maru and the Buryoku Maru; one ship is docked at the Osaka Wharf, named the Chikugo Maru; and one ship is docked at the China Merchants Bureau's North Pier, named the Banko Maru.

### Intolerable of Enemy's Fierce Coercion, Puppet Manchurian Army Revolts and is Disarmed

Enemy Marine Corps Commander Okawachi Transferred Back Home Due to Poor Combat Performance

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th: According to military intelligence, enemy Marine Corps Commander Okawachi has been transferred back to his country due to ineffective command. Furthermore, enemy Heavy Tank Unit Commander Major General Shigemitsu was hit by our artillery shell in Yanghang and suffered severe injuries. He is currently receiving treatment on a hospital ship.

According to Central News Agency, at approximately 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, dense gunfire was heard from the enemy positions in the direction of the Patriotic Girls' School. Our army immediately maintained strict vigilance to prevent their attack. The sound of gunfire stopped after about half an hour, and no enemy troops were seen advancing, nor were any bullets flying over. Our army was deeply surprised. After more than two hours, gunfire erupted again, but no bullets were seen flying over. Therefore, frontline soldiers were dispatched to sneak into the enemy's positions to investigate the situation. It was reported that the enemy was killing each other and disarming each other. After holding out for about half an hour, the gunfire subsided slightly until 9:30 PM, when gunfire erupted again. Sentries were dispatched again to investigate, and it was then learned that the Northeast puppet army, due to excessive oppression, suddenly had the intention to revolt. While they were planning to launch their revolt, their plan was discovered by the enemy, so they were disarmed, leading to internal strife. It was said that many intellectuals of the enemy also participated in it, so the incident was quite serious. The gunfire finally ceased at 1:00 AM yesterday morning, and it is thought that the puppet army had been resolved. Their circumstances are particularly regrettable.

### Tianjin-Pukou Railway: Our Army Advances Northward, Crossing Cangzhou

Our New Force Launching Fierce Attacks on Both Flanks Reached Near Yaoguantun Last Night

[Jinan] Yesterday's incident at Yaoguantun in Cangzhou was due to the enemy and our army exchanging defenses. The old army had withdrawn, and the new army had not arrived. A plainclothes team was dispatched to infiltrate Cangzhou city and fire shots. Now, after our new force took over the defense, it launched fierce attacks on both flanks and crossed Cangzhou in the evening, reaching near Yaoguantun. The enemy retreated in a panic. (Urgent telegram at 12:00 PM on the 26th)

One or two enemy artillery shells landed east of Fengjiakou Station without causing any losses. Our army is preparing to counterattack tonight. Today, enemy planes scouted Dezhou, Pingyuan, Yucheng, Linqing, Lingxian, and Jinxian in Deping, Dongguang, Yangxin, and Dexian, and dropped bombs. (Special dispatch on the 26th)

Central News Agency reports that the 29th Army Office received a telegram from Chairman Feng reporting on the battle situation on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway (excerpts): The enemy in the Cangzhou area has been fiercely attacking our positions for several days. The enemy and we have suffered many casualties. The front-line positions have been broken through by the enemy, and yesterday evening, Cangxian was already in a state of chaotic fighting. All transportation has been cut off, and there has been no contact so far.

### Base Behavior of Enemy Army: Aircraft Impersonates Our National Emblem

Bombed Guangde Yesterday Our Authorities Notify the Shanghai Concession Authority and Various Countries' Warships to Pay Close Attention to This Kind of Behavior Easily Causing International Misunderstandings

[Nanjing] Since the start of the war of resistance, enemy planes have come to bomb us, and our loyal and courageous air force generals and soldiers have inflicted heavy damage on them repeatedly. The Kisarazu Air Corps has been almost completely wiped out. After suffering this lesson, the enemy is extremely timid, and in a desperate attempt to reduce the damage of being shot down when they attack, they have impersonated our national aircraft markings. Two enemy aircraft, with the same model and color as our light bombers, and painted with our party emblem, flew to the vicinity of Guangde County at 10:30 AM on the 26th to launch a sneak bombing, dropping two 120-kilogram bombs. Afterwards, they flew from that place towards Shanghai. According to enemy air force's base behavior, it is similar to the act of a petty thief, extremely disgracing the dignity of their country. In contrast to the German Air Force's Baron Manfred von Richthofen in the European War, who specially painted his aircraft red and fought with the air forces of the warring countries in a grand manner in the blue sky, the military personality of the two is truly different from heaven and earth. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

[Nanjing] The enemy is accustomed to using base means, and now another example has been obtained, namely, the sudden discovery of enemy aircraft disguised with our national emblem dropping bombs in Guangde. At 10:10 AM on the 26th, two aircraft were discovered in the Guangde area, flying from the southeast. After receiving the report, our side increased vigilance. When the two aircraft flew closer, it was seen that their fuselages were decorated with our national emblem, and their shape was also very similar to our aircraft. They were flying very low, only 500 feet above the ground, and it was generally thought that our aircraft were returning. Unexpectedly, the two aircraft suddenly dropped two bombs, fortunately, they all landed at the base of the wall, without any damage. Our authorities believe that the enemy's actions are extremely base and not only can cause harm to us, but also easily cause international misunderstandings. They will now notify the Shanghai Concession Authority and various countries' warships to pay close attention. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

### Five Enemy Warships Arrived at Taishan; Landing Troops Were Repelled

We Killed Over 300 Enemies and Injured Over 200 Our Fishermen Near Macao Engaged in Fierce Fighting with Enemy Warships Enemy Warships Bombarded Zhenhai and Outside the Xiangsheng Bridge Estuary

[Hong Kong] Taishan County government telegram stated that five enemy warships arrived in the waters of Guanghai County on the 22nd, first bombarding our coast with artillery, and then sending over 700 landing troops. Our stationed troops were prepared and counterattacked with machine guns and artillery, killing over 300 enemies and injuring over 200, leaving only over 100 who fled back to the warships in a panic. Knowing that it was difficult to invade, the enemy ships sailed away. (Special dispatch on the 26th)

[Hong Kong] Four of our fishing boats sailed from the Guangzhou Bay to near Macao and encountered an enemy warship. The enemy warship sent a steamship to tow two of the fishing boats to the warship's side. The remaining two fishing boats, seeing the critical situation, fired ten artillery shells, sinking the steamship. Over ten enemies were killed or injured. The two fishing boats next to the enemy warship also fired artillery shells at the enemy warship. The enemy warship hastily opened fire and sank the four fishing boats. Dozens of fishermen heroically sacrificed themselves. Guangdong sent planes on the 26th to scout along the coast and found 12 or 13 enemy warships anchored. (Special dispatch on the 26th)

### The Tragic Aftermath of the Bombing of the Capital

All Departments Are Sorting, Arranging, and Resuming Work

[Nanjing] Ninety-six enemy aircraft bombed Nanjing in five waves on the 25th, both in the morning and afternoon. Many of our cultural, health, and charitable institutions were devastated. Many shops and civilian residences were also destroyed by the bombing, resulting in the tragic sacrifice of over a hundred civilians due to the Japanese army's brutal acts. On the 26th, all bombed departments began sorting, arranging, and resuming work with the utmost speed. The cleaning brigade and the Red Swastika Society were still collecting remnants and bodies at the bombed sites on the 26th. They recovered seven bodies on Zhongshan East Road, two in Santiao Lane, one in Da Shijie, one in Hujiazhai, and one in Baiziting. Most of these bodies had severed limbs and were burnt beyond recognition, a truly unbearable sight. The inhuman and barbaric behavior of the enemy army was completely exposed here. This reporter visited various bombed sites on the 26th and personally witnessed a bomb that landed behind the Central Hospital, destroying an area spanning twelve to fourteen meters in diameter and six to seven meters in depth. It can be inferred that the bombs dropped must have weighed at least five hundred kilograms. The enemy army, well aware of the sturdy construction of the hospital, used such massive bombs to destroy our most important public welfare institution. Another bomb, also weighing over five hundred kilograms, was dropped near the Literature Department of National Central University. The enemy army's deliberate destruction of our highest institution of learning is evident. According to the reporter's investigation, the areas bombed on the 25th also included Liugong Temple, Zhen Alley, Zhongshan Wharf, the Meixin Coal Factory, Sanwen River, Zhihe Street, Guanyin Temple, Toutiao Lane, Ertiao Lane, Yanzhi Alley, Zaizhu Alley, Da Shamao Alley, Hehe Street, Heheli, and Emei Road. Fortunately, most residents had taken refuge in shelters and escaped the disaster. Those killed in the bombing were all civilians. Despite the severe air raid suffered by Nanjing on the 25th, the general citizenry remained calm and dealt with the situation composedly. Although the 26th was a Sunday, all departments and organizations worked as usual. The enemy aircraft's barbaric actions, disregarding humanitarian principles and international law, have caused some damage to our city, but the millions of citizens' shared hatred of the enemy has only strengthened their resolve. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

[Nanjing] At 2:40 AM this morning, the air raid alarm sounded again. Residents, already terrified from the entire previous day, were awakened from their sleep. Upon hearing the alarm, people quickly put on their clothes and rushed into bomb shelters. The wind howled fiercely, making it feel very cold. However, enemy aircraft did not appear. An hour later, the alarm was lifted, and everyone returned to their beds feeling relieved. During yesterday's enemy air raid, a bomb landed between the Railway Department and the Ministry of Military Affairs, only four hundred yards from the British Embassy. The sailors of the British gunboats HMS Bee and HMS Mosquito had a clear view of the enemy aircraft bombing the Xiaguan power plant, as both ships were docked within two hundred yards of the power plant. Chinese authorities stated that the death toll yesterday was forty, with twice as many injured. Both the power plant and the waterworks were damaged yesterday, causing temporary disruptions, but they were restored to their original state this morning. The entire National Health Administration was destroyed. The Central Hospital narrowly escaped two heavy bombs, each weighing approximately five hundred kilograms, which created huge craters in the ground. Foreign observers were bewildered and unable to understand the enemy aircraft's intention to destroy the national health center. Mr. Pielczyk, a League of Nations health expert, whose office was located in the Health Administration, personally witnessed the agency being destroyed by the enemy's ruthless bombs. When enemy aircraft suddenly descended from the clouds to bomb the Health Administration, it was reported that two planes crashed near the business department of the Xiaguan power plant. Foreign observers saw one bomber half-submerged in a pond near the power plant. The pilot was blown about a hundred feet away from the plane, his head, arms, and legs separated from his body. A bomb landed in a pond near the newly established International Social Club, causing dead fish to float everywhere. The enemy aircraft's rampage was so indiscriminate that even small fish could not escape, which is truly lamentable. Several foreigners at the Italian Embassy witnessed several bombs explode within a hundred yards of Song Ziwen's residence. Luo Jialun, the President of National Central University, told a Reuters reporter that the university's art department and public health department were completely destroyed by enemy aircraft. Fortunately, the fifty patients in the public health department had been moved to another location in the morning, otherwise, they would have all perished. This was the fourth time that enemy aircraft bombed National Central University. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 25th)

[Nanjing] Japanese planes bombed Nanjing five times today. Although their main targets were the government offices north of the city and the densely populated civilian residences south of the city, stray bombs fell everywhere. A bomb landed in front of the Jiangsu Bank on Qijie Street, causing significant damage to the Nanjing branch of the Haitian News Agency. The Associated Press, located in the same building, was also affected by the bombing. Three houses opposite were reduced to rubble. (National News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Nanjing] Enemy aircraft invaded the city twice in the afternoon of the 25th. The Nanjing City Party Headquarters and the Nanjing branch of the French Havas News Agency were also bombed, and their buildings were destroyed. Our air force bravely responded, resulting in two aircraft being damaged. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

### The Xiang River Rises, Situation is Serious

[Hankou] The rise in the waters of both the Yangtze and Xiang rivers this year is unprecedented. Since the 22nd, continuous heavy rain has fallen in the Xiang River basin, causing the Xiang River to rise sharply again from the 23rd. At 6:00 AM on the 24th, the water level at Baihe reached 11.41 meters, a steep increase of eight meters in one day and two nights. At 6:00 AM on the 25th, the water level at Xiangyang reached 67.44 meters, only nine centimeters lower than the highest flood level in early August, making the situation quite serious. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau has telegraphed all its stations and county governments to maintain strict vigilance day and night. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)

### Yousheng Troupe Plans to Establish Fourth Hospital

The Eighth Red Cross Rescue Hospital of China, organized by the Yousheng Traveling Troupe, has its original hospital premises, which can accommodate more than 200 wounded soldiers. Since its establishment on August 20th, nearly 200 patients have been successively healed and discharged. It is reported that the directors of the rescue association of the troupe are of the opinion that with the war expanding day by day, the rescue work is becoming even more strained, and thus they are planning to establish a fourth hospital attached to the current one, increasing the number of beds to benefit the wounded soldiers. The plan is currently being planned and arranged.

Current Commentary

### The Possibility and Limitations of a Far East Conference

Since the start of our full-scale military resistance, the attitudes of the two major players in the Far East international arena—Britain and the United States—have undergone significantly different shifts. Britain's attitude, having been disappointed by its compromising negotiations with Japan, has become melancholic, ultimately prompting active promotion by the Pacific dominions. However, the Conservative Party gentlemen are still hesitant and observing. The United States' attitude, on the other hand, has become like a fever, with alternating chills and rising temperatures.

If we use facts to prove it, we can point out that since the British Chargé d'affaires, Mr. Hoare, arrived in China, he has met with Kawagoe in secret several times and reportedly presented four demands. (The four demands were: ㊀ The administration of the Shanghai International Settlement must be maintained in its entirety. ㊁ Japan must not take actions that endanger British commercial interests in South China. ㊂ British shipping along the Chinese coast must not be affected by Japan's blockade. ㊃ Japan must guarantee not to occupy militarily important islands near Hong Kong.) This was the high point of compromise negotiations with Japan. However, ironclad facts have proven that Britain's attempt did not succeed. The White Bandit's barbarous actions have only intensified. The blockade of the Chinese coastline has been extended from Shantou to Beihai, and Dongsha Island and Lingding Island, not far from Hong Kong, have actually been occupied by the Japanese fleet. The shelling of Hainan Island also reveals Japan's ambition to swallow everything up. In short, Hong Kong has become an object as easily retrieved as something in a pocket.

Not only that, but Japanese warships also attempted to land on Macau, cutting off the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and hindering Sino-British trade via the railway. Moreover, Japanese aircraft have been conducting continuous bombings of major cities in South China, such as Guangzhou and Chaozhou. What do these facts prove? They clearly prove that the Japanese bandits have rejected Britain's four demands and are determined to act recklessly, disregarding all international humanitarian principles and the commercial interests of any country in South China.

The failure of compromise negotiations has greatly disappointed British gentlemen. The proposal of "We will not include South China when seizing North China," which came from the mouths of the Japanese bandits, has now been shattered by ironclad facts, becoming nothing more than a painted cake, promising much but delivering little.

Amidst the disappointment and melancholy of British gentlemen, representatives from the British dominions in the Pacific, namely Australia, have stepped forward. Its representative to the League of Nations, Mr. Bruce, proposed to the League of Nations General Assembly on September 21 that the Sino-Japanese issue be taken out of the League of Nations and a separate international conference be convened. All countries with interests in China should participate to discuss stabilizing the precarious situation in the Far East.

British gentlemen have responded to this proposal from their dominions with sympathetic silence, while keeping their eyes on the United States, hoping for active action against Japan.

But what about the United States? The facts regarding the United States' attitude towards the Far East, from first withdrawing American residents from Shanghai, first deciding to suspend loans to China and Japan, and first imposing an arms embargo on the Far East, preventing the activities of exporters to China, show that its shrinking and regressive policy is no less than Britain's. However, Britain is actively trying to compromise with Japan, while the United States passively adopts a wait-and-see attitude, unwilling to compromise with Japan but also unwilling to clash with Japan. This has always been the case. Until recently, excessive cowardice risked eliciting the antipathy of a large part of the public, and it seems that there has been a tendency towards more active involvement. However, given the currently "chaotic" situation in the Far Eastern war, frankly speaking, the extent of its active involvement is still very limited.

The reason why Britain and the United States have failed to reach a consensus on the Far Eastern issue is quite complex. One is a historical legacy, and the other is an irreconcilable discrepancy in the weighting of economic interests. No need to mention events further back. Just looking at the Anglo-American relationship with the Far Eastern question after the September 18th Incident, the Stimson Doctrine era was a period when the United States adopted an active policy toward the Far East. However, in Britain, it was the most popular period of the Simon appeasement doctrine. The winter of 1935 was the most active period for Britain, while the United States was quiet and observing. We can assert that this situation will continue in the future and will not undergo major changes.

Understanding these factors, we can know that the possibility of a Nine-Power Treaty-based conference with the United States as the leader is extremely weak. The "tombstone of the Nine-Power Treaty has already been erected." How can we call it back to life? The Far East diplomacy centered on Washington is an obsolete item in history. We sincerely hope that the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty will be revived. However, we must not shy away from saying that this is just our fantasy. The responsible authorities in the United States have already expressed this informally. They have decided to avoid the predicament of the Stimson Doctrine diplomacy, as in 1932.

Secondly, regarding the convening of a Far East international conference based on the spirit of the League of Nations and centered on the content of the proposal made by the Australian representative, we believe that there is ample possibility. But its realization will still take considerable time, because China's diplomatic relations have not yet been severed, and the war situation is still developing. These are the main factors that are causing all countries to hesitate and observe the Far Eastern problem.

The Australian representative's proposal advocates including Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Australia in one meeting and discussing it together. Whether this kind of Far East conference is beneficial to us is really still questionable, because this conference has the potential to become dominated by Britain and Germany, and its task may only be to mediate the dispute between China and Japan. This casts a shadow on the future of China's resistance war. We certainly should never agree to it, and the Soviet Union will not agree to it either.

The Far East international conference that we hope for is based on a collective security mechanism of China, the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States, and builds a bulwark of peace guarantees. At a minimum, it must achieve economic sanctions against Japan.

The diplomatic key to realizing the possibility of sanctions lies in promoting the sympathy of the general public in various countries for our country. Thorough and long-term scorched-earth resistance is a fundamental factor in determining the use of our entire diplomacy.

National power is the foundation of diplomacy. At present, we should say that resolute and thorough resistance is the foundation of our diplomatic victory. We should not have excessive expectations or rely excessively on the current international relations in the Far East.

### The Enemy Army's Bestiality Is Fully Exposed, Disregarding Protests from All Countries

Trampling on Our Civilians, Destroying Our Culture, Britain Upholds Justice and Warns Japan Again

[Nanjing] According to a certain military expert, the enemy aircraft bombed the capital wantonly on the 25th, and the locations bombed were all places where non-combatants were located. They were displaying their savage and beastly nature. Their aim was to trample on our civilians and destroy our cultural, health, and charitable institutions, which is very obvious. After Hasegawa announced the plan to bomb Nanjing some days ago, various countries lodged serious protests with the Japanese government. Although the Japanese side stated that it would avoid bombing non-combatants, the results of the bombings on the 22nd and 25th adequately proved that the enemy despised international justice and disregarded humanitarianism. This is almost a formal response to the protests of various countries. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Tokyo] British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Clive protested to the Japanese government twice today about the bombing of Nanjing and Guangzhou. The wording was very strong. The Tokyo Foreign Ministry will not misunderstand Britain's true intention, and at the same time urge the Japanese government to note that when the Chinese capital was bombed on September 22, fragments of bombs fell on the roof of the British Embassy. (National News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

[Washington] Diplomatic authorities today believe that Japan's failure to heed protests from various countries and continuing to bomb Nanjing is a sign that it is desperately trying to conquer China by any means. To date, Japan has not responded to the United States' protest. State Department officials will soon issue a statement regarding the recent bombing. However, publicly acknowledging this action is a complete rejection of the United States' protest. Officials are unwilling to predict what kind of action the U.S. government will take in the future.

### Joint Action by Britain and the United States Is Enough to Curb Japanese Aggression

Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Britain and France Intensifies, Public Opinion Strongly Advocates Economic Sanctions

[London] The commentaries in various financial publications here generally believe that if Britain and the United States can take joint action, it will not be difficult to completely halt Japan's war machine, which shows that national public opinion is unanimously angry at Japan's aggression against China. The Daily Express stated that Japan is most susceptible to the impact of economic sanctions, because most of the raw materials it uses are supplied by other countries, and those from Britain and the United States account for 60%. Moreover, its cash reserves are very insufficient. 8 million pounds have been transported to London in the past week, which shows the emptiness of its economic situation. Of Japan's foreign trade, goods imported from the United States account for 33.7%, and the UK accounts for 31.4%. Raw materials account for almost 80% of all Japanese imports, the most important of which are wool, cotton, iron, and kerosene. Although Japan's stockpiles of kerosene may last for a long time, Australian wool and American cotton are still the mainstays of its imports. (National News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Paris] Regarding the conflict between China and Japan, the Socialist Party's organ, Le Peuple, recently stated, "If Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands could implement genuine economic sanctions against Japan, they would be able to stop the massacre by the country's soldiers. Japan is an island nation and must sell industrial products to feed its people. The country's strength is based on foreign trade. Therefore, the export industry is the economic lifeline of the country, and half of its exports are purchased by the above-mentioned five countries, especially the United Kingdom and the United States, which purchase a quarter and a fifth respectively. If Britain and the United States refuse to purchase Japanese silk and cotton, and do not sell kerosene, iron, rubber, and machinery to Japan, it would not be difficult to stop Japan's war of aggression against China within a few weeks." The Radical Socialist Party's L'Ère Nouvelle stated, "Regarding the bombing of Chinese cities by Japanese aircraft, after the British government lodged a protest with Japan yesterday, countries around the world should support it."

### Two British Peace Organizations Ask the Government to Take Action

[London] Public anger is growing in British society regarding the bombing of Chinese civilians by Japanese aircraft. The National Peace Council once again submitted a note to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Yoshida, expressing protest. At the same time, the International Women's Association, in addition to protesting to Ambassador Yoshida, also wrote to Foreign Secretary Eden to make an appeal. Details are as follows:

㊀ The note from the National Peace Council to Ambassador Yoshida, signed by the President of the Council, the Bishop of Birmingham, and the Opposition Labour Party Member of the House of Lords, Lord Ponsonby, stated, "We hereby declare to Your Excellency that the public opinion represented by this Council has always advocated the universal abolition of bombers and unjustified aerial bombings. This view is now all the more firmly entrenched due to the situation in the Far East. We will definitely urge the British government to take action again, so that it can completely solve it, and we will call on all countries around the world through the British government.

㊁ The letter from the International Women's Association to Foreign Secretary Eden stated that the British government must exert pressure on Japan to stop the killings. The British delegation to the League of Nations Assembly's Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue must do its best to urge the Committee to immediately submit the issue of indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft for discussion. In addition to expressing outrage, the Association's letter to Ambassador Yoshida also lodged a serious protest. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 25th)

### The League of Nations Assembly Enters Its Third Week, Three Outstanding Issues to Be Resolved

We Submit Memorandum Detailing Enemy Army Atrocities, Advisory Committee Scheduled to Reconvene Today

[Geneva] The 18th Regular Session of the League of Nations Assembly, which opened on the 13th of this month, has lasted for two weeks. Starting tomorrow, it will be the third week, or perhaps the final week, of the meeting. Before the closing of the meeting, there are three issues that the Assembly should resolve, namely the Spanish issue, the application submitted by China, and Chile's proposal to amend the League of Nations Covenant. Regarding the Spanish issue, the debate will begin tomorrow in the Sixth Committee (i.e., the Political Issues Committee). At that time, Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrin will demand, with an extremely resolute attitude, the full implementation of the League of Nations Covenant, so as to stop Italy and Germany from interfering in the Spanish Civil War. Regarding the application submitted by the Chinese government, the 23-nation Advisory Committee is scheduled to meet on the 4th, but many twists and turns are expected. Before Japan participates in the Committee, the Committee may have to go through a lengthy working process. Therefore, the League of Nations Assembly may decide to replace the 23-nation Advisory Committee with a meeting of a smaller number of people, so that countries that refuse to cooperate with the League of Nations can also participate in the meeting to jointly deal with the Sino-Japanese issue. Finally, regarding the Chilean government's proposal to consult with non-member states of the League of Nations on the amendment of the Covenant, it is reported that the Chilean government's attitude is extremely tough, threatening to withdraw from the League of Nations if the League of Nations does not accept it. However, it is generally believed that this issue can still be resolved through appropriate negotiations. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 26th)

### Our Representative Sends Note to League of Nations, Japan Refuses Third-Party Intervention

[Geneva] Today, according to reliable sources here, the Far East Problem Advisory Committee will condemn Japan's aerial atrocities when it meets on Monday. The Chinese side has prepared two memoranda, reporting in detail the bombing of Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Suzhou, and adding to Britain's anger, which is likely to lead to the passage of this kind of moral condemnation. Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has notified the League of Nations that he does not allow third parties to intervene in the Far East issue, saying that the crisis in the Far East is purely a matter between China and Japan, and Japan firmly believes that the two countries can find a fair and practical solution. (National News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

[Geneva] The Chinese delegation to the League of Nations has been very active today. ㊀ Gu Weijun, the chief representative of the country, has recently sent an official note to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, providing supplementary information on the bombing of Nanjing and Guangzhou by Japanese aircraft, and explaining that "Japanese aircraft engaged in bombing indiscriminately and intentionally destroyed many houses that had no military connection, resulting in a large number of ordinary people dying".

### Qian Tai Delivers a Moving Speech at the Disarmament Committee

㊁ At the meeting of the Third Committee of the League of Nations Assembly, namely the Disarmament Committee, today, the Chinese representative, Ambassador Qian Tai, delivered a moving speech describing the tragedy currently occurring in China. He stated, "Regarding the issue of disarmament, the significant achievements of the London Naval Conference last year are indeed commendable and gratifying. However, the increasing skepticism among nations as to whether various international disputes can be resolved peacefully is growing. Looking back to the Manchurian Incident in 1931, if we had been able to strongly compel the aggressor nation to respect the League of Nations Covenant, the Disarmament Conference would not have failed, and the arms race would not have begun. Now, the result of this competition has caused a great disaster in the Far East. Japanese militarists have committed many unjust acts, leading their country into a dangerous situation, and are invading other countries in the hope of resolving their difficulties. At this moment, Japanese troops are indiscriminately attacking non-combatants within Chinese territory. China is a peace-loving nation, and since the Manchurian Incident, it has endured adversity for six years. Now, China supports any measures based on the principles of justice and collective security that can strengthen the peace mechanism, especially the establishment of an agreement to limit armaments." In conclusion, he stated that the evolution of the international situation can only follow two paths: war and destruction, or peace and international cooperation. Nations should choose between the two. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 25th)

Note Sent to the U.S. State Department – Naval Actions Highly Commendable

[Washington] Chinese Ambassador Dr. Wang Zhengting recently sent a note to the U.S. State Department, listing the atrocities of the Japanese army. The full text is quite lengthy, stating, "Japan is perpetrating brutality against innocent Chinese civilians, the sick, and the wounded, even using poison gas, disregarding humanity. All basic principles of international law have been completely destroyed. It is difficult to find appropriate words to condemn these crimes." Chinese envoys stationed in other countries will also send similar notes to their respective governments. Ambassador Wang also stated to the press, "The U.S. government has protested to Japan regarding the bombing of Chinese cities. The purpose of the note submitted by the Chinese government today is to increase the force of the U.S. government's protest. However, I have not received orders from the government to request the U.S. government to lodge another protest, as this is a matter for the U.S. government, not for outsiders to interfere. Nor have I been ordered to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty." When asked for his thoughts on the statement issued yesterday by Rear Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Ambassador Wang replied that the action was "highly commendable."

Named Provisional Committee for the Collection of Customs Duties – Collecting Customs Duties from Japanese Ships Arriving in Shanghai

According to the English-language North China Daily News (today, September 26), it has been learned that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have been conducting customs affairs in the Yangshupu District since September 12. According to sources in the shipping industry, on September 10, the Japanese organized a committee with the intention of exercising customs duties in the area controlled by the enemy forces. The committee is headed by Yamamoto, president of Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Japanese member of the Shanghai Municipal Council. This is the result of a meeting between Japanese shipping companies and associations in Shanghai. The committee is named the "Provisional Committee for the Collection of Customs Duties." Since its establishment, it has been collecting customs duties from Japanese ships arriving in Shanghai, but only inspecting and taxing goods unloaded ashore. Military supplies are not inspected and do not go through any procedures. This morning, when someone inquired about this matter with Yamamoto, Yamamoto denied that the committee had started working, but said that they would indeed collect customs duties from Japanese merchant ships arriving in Shanghai. However, because Japanese ships arriving in Shanghai since the outbreak of the war have not carried any goods, the committee has not yet started working. Once Japanese ships resume carrying goods to Shanghai, the committee will tax the ships docked in Yangshupu according to regulations. At the same time, it is reported that the committee has a list of representatives from Dalian Kisen Kaisha, Nissin Kisen Kaisha, and the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry serving in rotation. The committee's office is currently located in the building of Nippon Yusen Kaisha. Yamamoto also emphatically stated that outside the areas managed by the Japanese army, navy, and air force, where the committee is in charge of tax administration, the Jianghai Customs House will continue to operate as usual. Therefore, the committee does not hinder the administration of the Jianghai Customs House. Although Yamamoto has made this statement, it is not yet known whether the authorities of various countries in Shanghai will protest against this.

### Resumption of British Shipping on the Yangtze River

Protecting the Inherent Interests of the British

Since August 13, the blockade of Jiangyin and the cutting off of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have fundamentally hindered shipping on the Yangtze River. Subsequently, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, San Peh Steam Navigation Company, Ning Shao Steam Navigation Company, Minsheng Industrial Company and other Chinese shipping companies first resumed the Jinghan, Jingguan, and Jingyu lines in the upper reaches in order to restore traffic on the Yangtze River.

This savings certificate has the same effect as the national salvation bond. Those earning more than sixty yuan can follow this procedure. Companies and businesses can collect the National Salvation Bond Certificates from the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks.

Continued Subscriptions from Various Sectors

The Chamber of Commerce's National Salvation Bond Fundraising Headquarters received reports yesterday on the subscription amounts from various industries as follows: the bookselling industry, 330,590 yuan (including 150,000 yuan from Commercial Press, 150,000 yuan from Chung Hwa Book Company, 20,000 yuan from World Book Company, 10,000 yuan from Living Books, 500 yuan from Shanggu Shufang, and 90 yuan from the staff of the trade association); also, the Chinese and foreign grocery industry, 15,000 yuan; the bicycle manufacturing and sales industry, 10,000 yuan; the silk industry, 10,670 yuan; the glass industry (third batch), 1,035 yuan.

Biscuit Industry, etc.

The captains and vice-captains of the biscuit, candy, canned food, and bread industries' National Salvation Bond Fundraising Subcommittee have been appointed: Le Rucheng, Xian Guansheng, Cao Baiheng, Lin Meibao, Ma Hanwen, etc., will respectively take on the responsibilities. They will actively conduct fundraising among their peers and, in accordance with capital, agreed to subscribe to 5%, to be paid in four installments. The first payment will be 2/5, and the remaining installments will be paid over three months.

The remaining members will subscribe as is. Those with sufficient resources will make a one-time subscription, and those who are slightly less capable will subscribe in installments, without strict restrictions.

In addition, Zhou Shifu, the owner of Lingling Food Factory, was fatally struck by stray bullets during an air raid, and his business was completely shut down as a result. In his dying words, he earnestly requested the union to persuade all members of the industry to donate all the sugar sacks to the front lines to fight the enemy. His wife even more commendably contributed 100 yuan to purchase the bond. Those who are still watching are now being urged through letters, hoping to raise a considerable amount.

### Mrs. Shi Donates Property

No Need to Exchange for National Salvation Bonds, Use the Proceeds as National Salvation Donation

The Local Association received a letter yesterday from Mrs. Qiushui, the widow of the late manager of Shen Bao, Mr. Shi Liangcai. She has unconditionally donated her self-owned property located at No. 3 Lulin, Lushan, including furniture, to the government for auction. The proceeds will be transferred for national salvation donations, stating that there is no need to exchange for national salvation bonds, and attaching five types of certificates. The association expressed its utmost admiration for this righteous act and has forwarded the original documents to the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Committee, requesting them to handle the matter according to the donor's wishes.

### Red Cross Transportation Unit Lacks Trucks

Hoping All Sectors Generously Donate Funds

Since Mr. Hu, the head of the Transportation Unit of the Shanghai Rescue Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society, took over the position, he has been devoted to rescue and transportation of wounded soldiers, sparing no effort and achieving remarkable results. However, due to the lack of material equipment, the work is quite difficult, especially due to the lack of trucks. The unit has insufficient funds. It only has [unreadable character] usable trucks of its own and rents the rest from various businesses. On average, each rented truck requires fifty yuan per day (including gasoline, repairs, compensation, and rental fees). However, even with such a price, only a dozen trucks can be obtained. If Shanghai lacks enthusiastic [unreadable character] and generous donations to universally save our loyal and brave wounded soldiers who are serving the country, it would be a great misfortune for the country.

### Ministry of Finance Telegram to Military and Police Agencies to Facilitate People's Exchange of Legal Tender

Military and Police Agencies Nationwide Should Provide Effective Protection When Exchanging Legal Tender for Silver or Purchasing National Salvation Bonds

In order to facilitate the people's exchange of silver coins and silver objects for legal tender, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly telegraphed military and police agencies across the country, instructing their subordinates to protect people carrying silver coins and silver objects to exchange for legal tender at exchange agencies, and not to obstruct them. The telegrams have been complied with by military and police agencies in various places. Now, the Ministry has also stipulated in the newly issued National Salvation Bond raising method that silver coins, raw gold and silver, and their manufactured products can be used to purchase national salvation bonds. The Ministry has specially telegraphed military and police agencies again, instructing border police in various places to provide effective protection for those who exchange silver coins and silver objects for legal tender, as well as those who purchase national salvation bonds with silver coins, raw gold and silver, and their manufactured products. At the same time, it sent a letter to the four banks to actively collect the exchanges in order to strengthen their strength and benefit the war of resistance. The original telegram is excerpted as follows: To the Provincial and Municipal Governments, Pacification Commissioners, and Commanders: In order to facilitate the people's exchange of silver coins and silver objects for legal tender, this Ministry previously telegraphed border police agencies across the country, instructing their subordinates to protect people carrying silver coins and silver objects to exchange for legal tender at exchange agencies, and not to obstruct them. If there are deliberate violations, the people should be allowed to accuse them and strictly investigate and punish them. Since the promulgation of the National Salvation Bond Regulations in August of this year, the Ministry has approved ten articles for the National Salvation Bond Raising Method. Article 2 stipulates that this bond is entrusted to the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks and the Postal Savings Bureau, and designates banks, money shops, and county and city treasuries in various places as collection agencies. Article 3 states that the cash raised includes hard currency, raw gold and silver, and their manufactured products. Since implementation, people in various places have been actively handing over hard currency, raw gold and silver, and their manufactured products to various collection agencies to purchase national salvation bonds. They should be provided with convenience to encourage them. Moreover, now is the time of the War of Resistance, and the exchange of [unreadable character] should be actively handled to strengthen our strength. Therefore, this telegram is issued again: All military and police agencies in various places should effectively protect people who hold silver coins and silver objects to exchange for legal tender at exchange agencies, or who carry hard currency, raw gold and silver, and their manufactured products to collection agencies to purchase national salvation bonds, and should not obstruct them for any reason. In addition to separate telegrams, this special telegram is sent for your information and instruction to your subordinates to comply with.

### Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Notice: Strict Investigation of Impersonation and Arrest

This Headquarters bears full responsibility and should issue a sincere notice: Anyone carrying out arrests in the concessions, other than personnel dispatched by the Municipal Police Bureau, and those who do not possess identification documents issued by this Headquarters, must not take action without authorization.

In addition to reporting and distributing to subordinates, this notice is issued to inform all military personnel, civilians, and others. Take heed.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Office Requesting Strict Pursuit of Grain Payment Deducted by Changshu County

A Decree Forbids Blocking Grain Circulation, Payment for or Grain Should Be Given.

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce had previously sent rice merchant Shi Zufeng to Changshu with a certificate from the Municipal Food Regulation Committee to purchase more than 2,490 dan of grain for Shanghai. When passing through Mochen, the grain was seized and confiscated. The Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting its release. The Chamber of Commerce received a reply telegram yesterday from Zhu Ping, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Food and Fuel Regulation Office, stating that the Changshu County Government had been ordered to release the grain. The Chamber of Commerce then replied, "Director Zhu Ping of the Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Food and Fuel Regulation Office, your telegram has been received. This shipment of rice was purchased in Changshu with a certificate issued by the Food Regulation Committee jointly established by the Shanghai Municipal Military and Political Organs. It is a legitimate transaction without any impropriety. This is irrefutable proof. However, the Changshu County Government recklessly seized the grain first and then cleverly defended itself afterward. In its reply to our Chamber's urgent telegram, it stated that the case had already been decided and could not be handled. It did not mention whether the grain should have been seized or confiscated. Recently, the Executive Yuan's telegram寒朱 [Hán Zhū] stated that provinces and [unreadable character] are not allowed to prohibit the circulation of grain. Shanghai has long relied on grain from Changshu. The shipment of rice was purchased with a certificate. According to the national laws and regulations, there is no reason for confiscation. Recently, our Chamber has sent two telegrams to the county to request legal avenues. Administrative punishment cannot be changed. We have requested that you mediate according to the law with sincere words, but there has been no reply. Now that your office has ordered the release, the county government, even if it defends its past mistakes, will not dare to disobey the order. If it still claims that the matter has already been decided, we request that your office order the county government to strictly recover the price of the rice that was sold and pay it in full or return the same quality and quantity of grain to the original owner. This is permitted by national laws and regulations and cannot be allowed to be shirked. Otherwise, rice merchants can be subject to the whims of one county, with no guarantees. Who would dare to transport the grain? Counties lacking rice will be greatly affected. We respectfully ask you to resolutely preside over this matter so that this case can be fairly concluded as soon as possible. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sends its regards."

### Foreign Merchants in the Northern District Must Move Goods Out by Deadline

### Local Association Investigates Asia Sound Radio Donation

18,000 Yuan Not Handed Over, Leading to Misunderstandings

According to Shen Shi News, after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Beile Road Asia Sound Radio in Shanghai was initiated by some amateur opera singers to broadcast Peking opera to raise funds. Starting from August 29, they held seven or eight performances, claiming that the donations raised would be handed over to the Shanghai Local Association for forwarding to the front lines. However, until recently, the donations had not been sent to the Local Association. It has been learned that the people in charge, such as amateur singers Hua and Jiang, are highly suspected. At the same time, Asia Sound Radio also donated a car, which has been used as a private possession, which is even more dissatisfactory to all parties, causing many misunderstandings. As a result, complaints have been raised one after another. In recent days, donors have been going to the Local Association to inquire about the truth. The association stated that the radio station's fundraising was initiated by other people and was not initiated by the association. The association had not heard of the process. However, it was found that the radio station had published the donation amounts in the Social Evening News on August 29 to September 5 and September 13 and 14. Excluding gold and silver jewelry and comfort items, the cash totaled about 18,000 yuan. However, the association has not received this amount. It believes that this matter is serious and is related to the convenience of future fundraising and the reputation of the association. In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Propaganda Committee for investigation, it has also sent personnel to Asia Sound Radio to investigate the truth with the responsible persons to avoid misunderstandings from outsiders.

### Songjiang Sojourners' Association in Shanghai Facilitates Land and Water Transportation

Songjiang News: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, many Songjiang natives have taken refuge in Shanghai. However, it is difficult to predict when this long-term war of resistance will end. Shanghai's living standards are high, making it difficult to stay for a long time. Or, some people may need to return to Songjiang for various reasons. At this time, transportation is inconvenient, and distant relatives are often inconvenienced. In order to facilitate the return of the fellow villagers, the Songjiang Fellow Villagers Association has negotiated with the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society to provide steam-powered cars and waterways to Songjiang every day. Fellow villagers who wish to return home are requested to register and contact the Songjiang Fellow Villagers Association at Wubenfang, Caishikou, Lafayette Road.

### We Recapture Yong'an Bridge, Advance Triumphantly, and Engage in a Desperate Battle with the Enemy at Kangjia Lane

Bloody Battle All Night Until Noon Today, the Enemy Is Already Weakened. The Enemy Attacked from Three Routes in the Jiangwan Area but Was Repelled by Us. Intense Artillery Battles Between Both Sides in the City Center and Pudong This Morning. We Build a Fire Net at Luodian, Killing More Than 200 Enemies.

After our army recaptured Yong'an Bridge, they triumphantly cleared out the remaining enemy in the vicinity. The enemy stubbornly resisted and successively dispatched large reinforcements from Yangxing and Xinzhen to join the battle. Kangjia Lane, Shen Laozhai to the northeast of Yong'an Bridge, and West Shenjiazhai were the locations of the most intense fighting. The fierce battle has been ongoing from last night until noon today. The enemy used its full strength of naval, land, and air forces to destroy our positions in one fell swoop. Our army was in high spirits, advancing one after another, each soldier fighting as if they were ten. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, but our army still holds the advantage. The enemy in the city center area simultaneously launched a large-scale attack on our Jiangwanzhen positions, but they were repelled by our army. At dawn this morning, enemy heavy artillery bombarded our Jiangwan Baoshan Road, North Station, and Macheng Road positions. Our Pudong heavy artillery units also returned fire, and the rumbling sound was continuous. The enemy suffered considerable damage. Enemy aircraft dropped more than ten heavy bombs on Baoshan Road and Macheng Road, shaking the entire city. Fires broke out in the Baoshan Road area, but damage to our army's positions was minimal.

### Bloody Battle All Night at Kangjia Lane

Both Sides Engaged in the Fiercest Hand-to-Hand Combat. The Enemy Appears to Be Weakened by This Afternoon.

After our army defeated the enemy in the battle of Jinjiawan in the Liuhang area, our army took advantage of the victory to advance along the road. The enemy was in disarray and retreated to Yangxing. Our army then recaptured Yong'an Bridge and continued to advance step by step, tracking the enemy forward. Last night, they advanced to Kangjia Lane and West Shenjiazhai, northeast of Yong'an Bridge, and engaged in fierce battles with the enemy there. The defeated enemy launched a fierce counterattack against our army last night. Several tanks repeatedly covered their infantry in their attack, but they were all repelled by our army's artillery fire. Enemy aircraft were also very active in the air, dropping bombs on our army's positions. Enemy warships in Baoshanjiang also fired heavy artillery to assist in the battle. The naval, land, and air forces launched simultaneously. Although the attack was fierce, our heroic soldiers fought bravely, charging forward under the enemy's artillery fire and engaging in the fiercest hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. After a bloody battle all night, the enemy was covered in dead and wounded and retreated in defeat. After a short break, the enemy replenished with reinforcements and attacked again. Our army continued to fight and inflicted heavy blows on them. By noon today, the fighting was still intense in the Kangjia Lane area, and the enemy already appeared to be weakened.

In the Luodian area, after our army recaptured Jinjiazhai, they held on to the enemy's defensive fortifications and the entire line remained unchanged.

### The Enemy Attacks Jiangwanzhen from Three Routes

Fierce Fighting Unfolds in the Gaojingmiao Area. The Enemy Has Already Retreated by Dawn This Morning.

After the enemy suffered a setback in Luodian and Liuhang, the central route attack plan was severely hampered. Therefore, they planned to attack our Jiangwan positions to try to contain us. While the fierce battle was taking place at Yong'an Bridge last night, the enemy forces in the city center launched an attack on our Jiangwan with newly arrived reinforcements. The enemy advanced from Lujiajiao, Sanmin Road, and Xiangyin Road, hoping to encircle our Jiangwanzhen. When their infantry advanced, enemy aircraft and artillery also concentrated their firepower to bombard Jiangwan. Our army was prepared and immediately launched a head-on counterattack. Fierce battles broke out with the enemy in the Gaojingmiao area. Our army rose up one after another, displaying unparalleled heroism. The attacking enemy forces were all sacrificed under our army's bayonets and machine guns. After a bloody battle until dawn this morning, our army in Jiangwan had repelled the enemy. This morning, the enemy's artillery in the city center continued to bombard our army's Jiangwan positions, but the losses were minimal.

### We Outflank the Enemy on Shuidian Road

Killing More Than Twenty Enemy Soldiers

At 4:00 AM this morning, in the dim light of dawn, the enemy at the Patriotic Girls' School, under the cover of three tanks and two platoons of infantry, attacked our Shuidian Road Chizhi University positions. Seeing the fierce attack of the enemy, our defending troops avoided the front and outflanked them from the left and right, using dense firepower to destroy the enemy vehicles. At the same time, our artillery also bombarded the enemy positions at the Patriotic Girls' School. The enemy's outpost and following infantry lost contact. Our army bravely launched an attack, killing more than twenty enemy soldiers. At around 7:00 AM, the enemy could not hold on and collapsed back toward the Patriotic Girls' School.

### Enemy Aircraft Dropped Bombs Again This Morning

Three Bombs in the Southern City, More Than Ten Bombs in Other Places

From 7:00 AM to 11:30 AM today, nine enemy aircraft, divided into three teams, reconnoitered various parts of the city, and dropped three bombs near Dananmen in the southern city and more than ten bombs in Pudong, Zhabei, and other places. However, because they had no targets, there were no other major losses except for heavier damage to our civilian houses.

### We Build a Fire Net, Killing Two Hundred Enemies

Seizing the Diary of an Enemy Captain, Stating That Our Army Is Brave and the Enemy's Future Is Bleak

In the Luodian area, at a certain transportation hub captured by our army a few days ago, it was expected that the enemy would have to launch a full-scale attack sooner or later, so they actively built defensive fortifications and set up machine guns in the hidden places on both sides, aiming at the road and forming a "fire net." Unexpectedly, at dusk yesterday, the enemy indeed launched a full-scale attack. First, they used aircraft and artillery to cover the attack, followed by about 300 enemy soldiers who rushed forward. When they rushed into the fire net, our army fired intensely. More than 200 enemy soldiers were shot and fell dead. The rest collapsed and retreated in panic. During the search of the corpses, many enemy flags of the small squad of the regiment were found, belonging to the Sato unit of the 11th Division of the enemy. In the diary of one captain, it was recorded that the Chinese army was brave in combat and the Japanese side's future was bleak.

### Enemy Air Force Cables Tokyo for Assistance

Military News: The enemy army has a Shanghai air force, numbering between 125 and 140 aircraft, of which heavy bombers account for two-thirds. However, they have suffered heavy losses in recent days due to intense anti-aircraft fire from our defense forces. Therefore, the enemy army telegraphed the Kaspau Naval Air Base in Tokyo again yesterday, requesting the dispatch of 50 elite aircraft and 100 airmen to Shanghai for deployment. However, our local air defense facilities have been carefully redeployed. No matter what attack the enemy planes undertake, they will hardly succeed. Once the enemy air force from that province comes to Shanghai, it will be difficult for them to survive.

### Enemy Boats Reconnoiter Pudong Docks

They Fled Immediately Upon Being Fired Upon By Our Troops

The enemy army's recent aggressive attempt to attack Pudong has reached a stalemate. Since the massive bombing by enemy planes the day before yesterday afternoon, they have used warships and artillery to bombard heavily throughout the night, and even sent boats to launch surprise attacks. Our army relied on superior positions and retaliated with heavy artillery fire towards the enemy's positions, inflicting heavy damage and chilling the enemy's courage. Therefore, yesterday they only intermittently fired artillery as a show of force, which did not stop until late at night. Our army then used heavy artillery to attack the enemy at midnight yesterday. The rumbling sound shook the houses and the ground. The enemy warships, fearing being hit by artillery shells, moved up and down from time to time after firing. After about an hour of engagement, the artillery fire subsided. Starting at 2:00 AM this morning, enemy motorboats adopted guerrilla tactics, going back and forth in the center of the Huangpu River, reconnoitering the various docks of Pudong, and firing machine guns from time to time. As soon as our army returned fire, the enemy soldiers, fearing death, fled in disarray. At dawn this morning, our troops and the enemy once again engaged in heavy artillery fire, sometimes sparse and sometimes dense. At 8:00 AM, three enemy planes flew over Pudong to assist in the battle, dropping bombs, but with no targets, they had no effect. Before noon today, enemy warships only fired a shell every few tens of minutes. Judging from their cowardly actions in recent days, the dream of occupying Pudong has long vanished.

### Unprecedented Fierce Artillery Fire: Our Troops and the Enemy Engaged in Artillery Battle This Morning

Both Sides' Front Lines Remained Unchanged - Damage from Enemy Bombing Was Minimal - Enemy Small Unit Harassment Was Repelled

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Starting at 5:00 AM this morning, the enemy in the downtown area once again bombarded our positions in the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas with heavy artillery. Our heavy artillery units in Pudong also retaliated against the enemy's base in Hongkou. For a time, the artillery fire rumbled. Our artillery units had accurate targets, and the enemy suffered extremely heavy damage. The artillery fire was still dense at noon today. The front lines of both sides remained unchanged. In addition, six enemy planes flew in detachments this morning to the north of Baoshan Road North Station and the area around Maigen Road, reconnoitering the sky. At about 8:30, they continuously dropped more than a dozen heavy bombs. The sound of the fierce explosions shook the entire city. At that time, part of the buildings on Baoshan Road caught fire, and black smoke shot straight into the sky. Along Baoshan Road and the North Station area, machine gun and rifle fire sounded simultaneously. The enemy repeatedly harassed us with small units, but they were all repelled. Around 11:00 AM, the enemy planes quietly fled. The damage to our positions was minimal.

At 5:00 AM This Morning

The enemy troops in Hongkou, the city center, Jiangwan Road, the 63 Flower Garden, Baziqiao, the Japanese Cemetery, etc., began to fiercely attack our garrison in Zhabei again. First, the enemy from the Yangshupu area opened fire with large cannons, and then the enemy from the city center also successively opened fire. Our army, knowing that the enemy was rumored to launch a general attack today, was prepared early and responded calmly, and then also used

Heavy Artillery Retaliation

Back and forth, the mutual bombardment lasted for about two hours. At about 7:15, the enemy troops made closer contact. Our troops immediately jumped out of the trenches and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. At the same time, they used heavy machine guns, hand grenades, and mortars to bombard and sweep each other. Although the enemy also used machine guns to strafe, they were attacking while we were defending, so they were far less effective than our army. Before long, the enemy

Could Not Withstand and Retreated

At 8:30, many enemy planes, divided into several groups, each group of three, two, or one, appeared in the sky and dropped bombs on our army's positions to assist in the battle. The roaring sound shook the entire city of Shanghai. At this time, the enemy army launched a second charge, and was once again repelled by us. However, after this, enemy planes continuously took turns dropping major bombs. A large number of bombs fell on the section from the intersection of Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road to the library of the Commercial Press. When the bombs fell,

Thick Smoke Shot Straight

Reaching into the sky, looking from afar as if a heavy fog was spreading, making it difficult to distinguish. However, our army's front lines have not changed in the slightest. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented since the outbreak of the war in Zhabei. When the reporter finished writing, the enemy and our troops were still engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The sound of large and small cannons was as dense as a string of beads, and the crackling sound of machine guns was like firecrackers.

### Enemy Planes Attack Jiangxi

A Bomb Hits a Maternity Hospital

[Nanchang] When enemy planes attacked Nanchang on the afternoon of the 24th, a bomb hit the maternity hospital established by the church, killing seven civilians and injuring 58 male and female laborers. 85 households were affected.

### One Enemy Plane Attacked Guangzhou at Night

[Guangzhou] The people of Guangzhou, already startled, were unable to sleep peacefully all night again last night, because air raid warnings were issued twice during the night, and the alert was not lifted until 6:45 AM this morning. However, only one enemy plane attacked, between 3:30 and 4:00 AM, dropping two bombs in the fields near the airfield. There were no losses. Although Shamian and the gunboats of various countries were not affected, they have also been uneasy all night for more than ten days. On average, everyone is startled awake twice a night, and it is heard that the Japanese military authorities have stated that they want to bomb and cut off the Yuehan Railway. Therefore, there will definitely be a large amount of bombing in the next few days. If the traffic on the Yuehan Road is obstructed, the foreigners and gunboats on the Yangtze River will be greatly affected. At least the source of food and other supplies will be cut off.

### The League of Nations Advisory Committee Will Hold a Meeting Today

Australia Will Propose a Pacific Conference - Russia and France Will Oppose It, and the United States Is Also Very Indifferent

[Geneva] The League of Nations Advisory Committee will hold a meeting today to discuss China's complaint regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict. At that time, Australian representative Bruce will submit a resolution advocating the convening of a conference of countries related to the Pacific to discuss the current urgent issues. It is heard that the Soviet delegation will strongly oppose this suggestion, and France may also oppose it. Therefore, whether the motion can be passed depends on the attitude of the United States. Judging from the current situation, the United States does not seem to be very enthusiastic about participating in this kind of conference. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, broadcast a speech to the United States today, requesting sympathy and assistance for China in this critical moment. Gu also warned the countries of the Pacific that if Japan wins in China, the countries will be in danger of continued aggression. Moreover, the consistent policy between China and the United States has been to value friendship and mutual assistance. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 27th)

### The Soviet Union Strongly Protests to Japan

Regarding the Bombing of Nanjing

[Moscow] The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially announced today that Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Lavsky, lodged a "strong protest" in Tokyo yesterday regarding Japan's request for the Soviet Embassy to withdraw from Nanjing. The note reiterated the Soviet Embassy's determination to remain in the Chinese capital and warned the Japanese government that "the Japanese government shall bear full responsibility for any consequences of such illegal acts. Furthermore, the Japanese side claimed, based on reports from Shanghai, that Chinese planes were preparing to disguise themselves as Japanese planes and bomb the Soviet Embassy in order to provoke a Sino-Soviet conflict. The Soviet Embassy has warned the Japanese side that it must bear all responsibility for the bombing as a countermeasure against the Japanese fabrication of rumors. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 27th)

[Moscow] The Chinese Embassy here sent a note to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 25th of this month, detailing the Japanese aircraft's bombing of civilians, refugees, Red Cross relief teams, and cultural institutions," and requested the Soviet government to take appropriate measures to stop this uncivilized and inhumane behavior as soon as possible." The document pointed out that Japan, "in violating international law and moral concepts, is intentionally attempting to implement its barbarism. Japan is challenging Chinese culture, and the places where peace workers reside are being destroyed. Japan is even demanding that the embassies of various countries in Nanjing withdraw in order to achieve its goal of destroying the Chinese capital. (Reuters dispatch)

### Casual Comments

— Appearance

Suppose there is a person who specializes in using deceptive and cunning means and completely disregards justice and humanity, then he is said to have no personality. Suppose a country specializes in using deceptive and cunning means and completely disregards justice and humanity, then it is said to have no national character. The commander of the Japanese Third Fleet notified the embassies and consulates of various countries the day before yesterday to leave the capital quickly, but all were rejected. Therefore, a kind of news policy was used, saying that our country's planes would bomb the embassies and various departments in order to create a scapegoat. Although this kind of propaganda is not worth a smile from knowledgeable people, its deceptive and cunning tricks have been completely exposed. Now, enemy planes are using our country's national emblem to fly to Guangde and bomb it. This kind of ghostly trick is even more obvious. Therefore, some say that this kind of trick is originally what the enemy is used to doing. The enemy's specialty lies in this. Otherwise, they would not be worthy of being called the enemy.

### Six Enemy Warships Attack Humen, Guangdong Navy Wins a Major Victory in Response

□□□□ Two Warships Took the Initiative - Enemy Warships Escaped in Disarray, One Sank

Guangzhou Communication: After blockading our coast, enemy warships repeatedly attacked our coast. On the morning of the 14th of this month, six enemy warships suddenly sailed towards Humen and attacked the various forts. At that time, two warships stationed in 𫁛, □□□□, immediately came out to respond to the battle, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy warships and creating a glorious history of resistance against Japan for our navy. Regarding the situation of the battle at that time, a senior staff member of the 口口 warship talked in detail as follows:

According to the crew member, since the enemy's unreasonable invasion, the coastal ports of our country have borne the brunt, with Songhu being the first, followed by Xiamen, Shantou, and Fuzhou, where battles have also occurred one after another. Humen Fort, as the first gate of the Hai𫁛 sea defense, is indeed the only target for enemy warships to attack. Our Guangdong Provincial military authorities have already seen this point, so in addition to stationing troops, they also ordered the navy and air force to dispatch at any time, preparing everything. If the enemy invades, they will be given a head-on blow. The enemy learned that our sea and land forces were fully prepared, so although they frequently sent planes and warships to harass Shantou, Xiamen, and other places, there was no action against Humen Fort for a long time. Our Humen garrison also did not slacken its vigilance because of this, giving the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of. Since enemy warships repeatedly fired artillery at Chiwan within British territorial waters some time ago, enemy warships have also been found in Dapeng Bay and Lingdingyang waters one after another. Our military authorities believed that enemy warships would definitely come to attack our Humen Fort for a first adventurous attempt, so the port defense work became more tense, reinforcing it again after it was fortified, preparing to give the enemy a head-on blow. Sure enough, six enemy warships, Sanae and Hayakaze, etc., suddenly invaded and harassed our Humen Fort on the early morning of the 14th of this month. At that time, our □□□□□ and □□□□□, were patrolling outside Humen. □□ guided in front, followed by □□, when they sailed to the Sampan Zhou waters about eight nautical miles from Humen Fort, they suddenly saw black smoke billowing ahead, with many enemy warships invading towards Humen. □□ Captain Chen Dade, on the command platform, after observing the enemy's trail with binoculars, determined that it was indeed an enemy warship spying on Humen Fort, so he took the initiative, ordered the officers and men on the warship to prepare everything, and then first fired at the enemy warship. □□ warship also followed with artillery fire. The enemy warships knew that we were prepared, and immediately dispersed and returned fire. The Humen Fort side received the report and also opened fire to assist in the battle, firing at the enemy warships. For a time, the artillery fire rumbled, echoing far and wide. Before long, our air force received the report and dispatched a large group of planes to fight in the air, bombing the enemy greatly. Among them, enemy warship No. 29 was hit and seriously injured by our 口口 warship's artillery shells, but it still resisted stubbornly. In the end, it could not withstand the attack from our sea, land, and air forces, and after resisting for about 50 minutes, it covered the damaged warship and escaped in disarray.

This time, under the command of Captain Chen Tiande of the ×× warship, the officers and men on the warship fought exceptionally bravely. The major commanders Tang Xi and Chief Patrol Lu Shounan, and the important personnel of the ×× warship, Feng Ruzhen, etc., were especially brave, so they were able to inflict heavy damage on the enemy warship. The ×× warship fired with extraordinary accuracy, with every shell hitting the target. I and others watched from the warship with binoculars and witnessed that when ×× fired the first shell, it hit the stern of an enemy warship, and the enemy flag at the stern fell into the sea. When the second shell was fired, the shell went down the enemy warship's chimney and destroyed the engine room. Black and yellow smoke billowed out, rushing up into the sky, over thirty or forty zhang high. At that time, it was known that the enemy warship had suffered heavy damage, and it was estimated that more than 200 officers and soldiers in the engine room were killed. When the third shell was fired, it hit enemy warship No. 29 again, and it was seen that the warship was tilted and had a tendency to sink. The remaining enemy warships, seeing that the situation was not good, rushed to the warship to support it and fled in disarray.

After the enemy warships were defeated and fled, the sea was calm and the river was clear. Our Humen Fort remained unscathed. The mouths of the warships He Zhou only had three soldiers killed and three wounded. One machine gun of the Hai Zhou warship was only slightly injured. The statistics show that the losses were extremely minimal. Afterwards, according to the report of the fishermen of Dakouguan, an enemy warship No. 29 sank in the waters of Dakou. Thinking that this warship, after being injured, had sunk there. This adventurous attempt by the enemy warship has cost them dearly. In addition, the enemy warships attacked Humen this time with a total of six ships. Each time they fired, they fired at least six shots. The momentum was quite fierce. According to the range and speed of the shells, it usually took about a hundred seconds to reach the destination. But in this battle, an average of about three seconds elapsed, and more than thirty shells were fired at us. It is estimated that the enemy warships fired more than 400 shells, but our warships were able to avoid them properly, and were never hit. The reason why the enemy suffered heavy blows in this battle was, of course, beyond their expectations. The reason was also that they were too contemptuous of the enemy, and no one took it seriously. They thought that our country's navy would never dare to go out to sea to fight, so they marched straight in a mighty manner, firing attacks from twelve nautical miles outside Humen. Unexpectedly, our ×××× two warships actually sailed out to sea eight miles away, and fought the enemy warships within the range of the shells, and the enemy suffered heavy losses.

### Pang Jingzhou Talks About Rear Area Relief Work

Wounded Soldiers and Medical Corps are being moved to the interior - manpower and material resources in the interior are not as good as Shanghai - Hoping that all circles in Shanghai will contribute money and effort

Yesterday, according to Red Cross Secretary-General Jingzhou, (1) Shanghai is no longer a suitable area for setting up wounded soldier hospitals, so the Red Cross's Shanghai war relief work, in addition to striving to expand the organization of ambulance teams in accordance with the needs of the situation, in order to facilitate long-distance escorts in many aspects, is striving to move all hospital work to the interior for continued operation. such as □□□□ and other places, Shanghai's relief hospitals must be moved in the next few days. However, the manpower and material resources in the interior are not as good as Shanghai in every aspect, and I hope that all circles in Shanghai are willing to contribute money and effort. (2) As for the fact that people in society previously criticized the relief hospitals in the interior a lot, it is because they don't know that there are few people, scarce material resources, traffic stagnation, and slow action in the interior, so it is certainly not as easy to run a hospital in Shanghai. But if you give it some time, you will definitely be able to achieve considerable results. The Red Cross Hospital in Suzhou can be a precedent. (3) Some people may also talk about the fact that the Red Cross ambulance team cannot take risks at any time and rush to the fire line to rescue and teach. According to the universal practice of all nations, the Red Cross's sanitary service to the army originally stands in an assisting position (Wan Tuowei, the representative of the International Red Cross Society who came to Shanghai from Geneva recently, said so). The enthusiastic members of the ambulance team are certainly different from the stretcher bearers on the front line, especially in China. If there is an accident, there will be a problem of compensation. If the Red Cross recruits 1,000 people and sets up an ambulance team, and unfortunately 200 people have an accident, let alone, each person needs to be compensated 500 yuan, and 100,000 yuan must be prepared first to organize. But on the eve of the Shanghai war, the donations received by the Red Cross were less than 1,000 yuan. After the end of the war, will anyone think of this huge post-disaster payment? If it is said that the ambulance team can do without transportation, and only needs to rely on its blood to walk to the church, how can it be known that even if there are a thousand team members, how many people can they save in a day after a long journey? Furthermore, Japanese soldiers are so cruel, where is the safety guarantee for such a team that operates empty-handed? May I ask who can answer? So, whether this kind of hasty impulse is worth it seems to be worth careful consideration. (4) The Red Cross cannot get the support of the public in advance, store up strong financial resources, and prepare sufficient vehicles, so that it can compile more emergency teams, but it is training a general enthusiastic rescue and compiling an excess of ambulance personnel, but it is an unexpected and deformed phenomenon. However, the Red Cross organizers are diligent and willing to work hard, and will never be discouraged by this. They believe that in the event of war and danger, the public naturally has great sympathy for the cruelty of war. No matter how exhausted the relief personnel are, they are originally bound to be criticized by the society. But look at the relief work of various countries in the European War. How much better is it than ours? But at that time, it was often criticized by people.

### Statistics on Solicitation of Donations for National Salvation by the Donation Raising Committee

Gold and Silver Items Were Collected - Weighing More Than 20,000 Taels in Total

The solicitation of donations for national salvation in Shanghai City began after the solicitation of national salvation bonds, and stopped on September 10. The association's solicitation of gold and silver items to be transferred to donations for national salvation has achieved considerable results. The first batch of received quantities has been revealed and received by personnel dispatched by the Central Bank. The second batch received a large amount from August 25 to September 10. Because the Central Bank has been busy with the work of collecting and exchanging gold and silver items recently, it has not yet dispatched and transferred them. According to the association's statistics, the first batch collected a total of 272 pieces of gold jewelry, 158 gold rings of various colors, 13 pieces of gold utensils, and 6 pieces of foreign gold coins and scrap gold, totaling 449 pieces of gold items, weighing 60.528 taels. 68 silver ingots, 1,498 silver standard coins, 1,957 various silver subsidiary coins, 1,330 silver utensils, 1,102 pieces of silver jewelry, 77 pieces of broken silver, and 789 silver gifts, totaling 6,821 pieces of silver items, weighing 20,052.771 taels. Other non-pure gold and silver items, such as platinum jewelry, various diamond rings, fountain pens, inlaid gifts, etc., are not included in the above quantities.

### Measures for Paying National Salvation Bonds in Small Amounts

Open a Savings Passbook

The Shanghai Business Community Donation Team for National Salvation Bonds stipulates that for employees of various companies, firms, factories, and shops whose salaries and remuneration are more than 50 yuan per month, purchasing public bonds at 10% is the standard, and those less than 50 yuan can purchase freely. The smallest denomination of this public bond is five yuan. There are no clear regulations on how to issue public compensation for odd amounts. In order to clarify the calculation method, the reporter specifically learned the deduction method from the general association as follows: For employees whose salaries and remuneration are 50 yuan per month, 10% will be deducted, that is, five yuan will be given to purchase public bonds. If it is 60 yuan, the deduction amount is six yuan. In addition to giving five yuan of public bonds, the remaining one yuan will be given a national salvation savings passbook. Therefore, this savings passbook has the same effect as the national salvation bond. Those above 60 yuan can be handled accordingly. As for the application of the national salvation bond passbook, various companies and firms can collect it from the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong.

### Unemployed Workers are Registered by Region

Appoint Committee Members to Handle Everything

The Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, etc., have jointly organized the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee in order to relieve unemployed workers. The Municipal Party Department, etc., have appointed local competent authorities and leaders of various groups as committee members. All rules have been formulated and are ready. It has been decided to first register unemployed workers by region (Zhabei, Hudong, Husi, Pudong, Nanshi, etc.), and then classify registered workers by skill in order to find ways to provide relief separately.

### Job Relief Service Department Seeks Skilled Workers for Registration

The Job Relief Service Department of the Vocational Education for National Salvation Association held its first meeting yesterday. Shen Yangkou, Yang Chongkou, Wang Wenqing, Pan Jie Mei, and others attended. It was decided to divide the department into: ❶ Talent Registration and Job Placement Group; ❷ Refugee Education Group; ❸ National Products Investigation and Promotion Group; ❹ Recruitment and慰劳 Group; ❺ Production and Supply Group. Now, due to actual supply needs, skilled and specialized personnel are being sought for immediate registration in the following areas: (A) Drivers and mechanics for repairing automobiles; (B) Repair and installation of telephone equipment; (C) Repair of railway bridges; (D) All kinds of specialized personnel needed during wartime. Those who believe they possess the above skills should register at the department's second office at 80 Hualong Road between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM or 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM daily. They will be notified immediately when needed.

### Tax Reduction on Export of Dried Cocoons

Good Autumn Harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces – Ministry Order to Restore Original Tax Rate

The Shanghai Silk Manufacturers Association previously reported that foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson were raising the price of dried cocoons in Shanghai, purchasing large quantities for export, leading to a depletion of raw materials for Shanghai silk factories and forcing them to suspend operations. The Association specifically requested the Ministries of Finance and Industry to prohibit the export of dried cocoons or increase the export tax. After consultation between the Ministries of Finance and Industry, an order was issued to the Jianghai Customs to change the export tax rate for item 170 (including palace cocoons) in the export tariff to 42 yuan per 100 kilograms of national currency, effective from August 11. The purpose was to reduce the export of dried cocoons. Now, due to the impact of the war, silk factories in various places have been forced to suspend operations. At the same time, the autumn cocoon harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is abundant. It is believed that increasing the export tax on dried cocoons is unnecessary. A special order has been issued to Jianghai Customs to temporarily approve the restoration of the original export tax rate of 28 yuan per 100 kilograms of national currency for dried cocoons. The Customs has already issued a public notice.

### Tetanus Among Wounded Soldiers at the Front Lines is Worrisome

Need for Tetanus Antitoxin Injections – Hope for Swift Purchase and Assistance from All Sectors

Tetanus is a very dangerous disease, and many wounded soldiers at the front lines suffer from it. When soldiers are injured by explosions, germs from the ground take the opportunity to enter the bloodstream and spread rapidly. This attacks the brain and spinal cord, causing various dangerous symptoms such as spasms and opisthotonos, leading to death. The only way to treat it is with tetanus antitoxin injections. In severe cases, 100,000 to 200,000 units are needed, but if administered when first discovered, 3,000 units are sufficient. However, these antitoxin injections have already sold out in Shanghai, causing hospitals to suffer from the difficulty of not being able to purchase them. Soldiers suffering from this disease are facing death without any treatment. The "Friends' Voice" Travel Group, in order to benefit the wounded soldiers, inquired from Little Luzon, and found that only 1,000 injections remained there (each injection containing 3,000 units, priced at 3 yuan in national currency). Although the group intended to purchase all of them, the required funds were too large. In addition to the 200 injections the group purchased for its own Eighth Relief Hospital, it plans to ask for donations from all sectors to jointly purchase the remaining 800 injections and send them to hospitals at the front and rear, to benefit the wounded soldiers. Donations from members of the group are especially welcome.

### The State of the Collapsed Wall of Longhua Temple After Bombing

### Decrease in Refugees in This City

Repatriation Work Gradually Coming to an End – Still Hoping for Donations for Future Use

Ningbo Native Association

Since the outbreak of the war, the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai has been actively handling the reception and repatriation of fellow Ningbo natives in distress. Currently, all the Association's reception centers have been closed, except for the Tenth Reception Center, which still houses 877 people, and the Fourteenth Reception Center, which houses 925 people. The relief team has ceased its work, but the organization remains in place, ready to resume at any time. According to statistics, the association has repatriated 80,200 Ningbo natives in distress from the reception centers, and adding those who applied for repatriation at that time, the number should be over 150,000 people. Therefore, the Association has spent a considerable amount of money on repatriation and relief, and as the long-term war has just begun, it is necessary to continue this work. Therefore, the Association sincerely hopes that fellow Ningbo natives with some financial means will donate more to relief efforts, in order to relieve the suffering of fellow Ningbo natives in distress.

Five Counties Relief Association

The Joint Relief and Repatriation Committee of the Native Associations of Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jintan, Liyang, and Yangzhong counties has been actively finding ways to repatriate refugees. A total of 26 shipments have been made, involving approximately 20,000 people. Yesterday, the Danyang Red Cross Society sent all the refugees in its care back to their original homes, approximately 1,000 people. If there are refugees from the five counties in each refugee reception center, they will be sent to the Association for continued repatriation. Repatriation is carried out once every afternoon, involving approximately 200 people. If fellow natives from the five counties wish to return to their hometowns, they can register with the Association on Baker Road for repatriation. The repatriation expenses are borne by the Association. It is said that it can be completely finished by the end of the month.

Jiangning Native Association

The Jiangning Six Counties Native Association in Shanghai is now continuing to register for three more days at the request of fellow natives in Shanghai, from the 26th to the 28th. The location remains at the Association's headquarters on Xinzha Road. To facilitate fellow natives in the Nanshi area, registration will also be conducted at the 19th Refugee Reception Center of Pujisi Temple on Lafayette Road and Pingjili Road. The Association has published announcements in the Shen and Xin newspapers. Fellow natives from the Jiangning six counties who wish to return home should go to register as soon as possible.
