### Statement by the Spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Lugouqiao Incident

The Japanese Army Should Be Fully Responsible for Violating the Agreement and Attacking Our Side's Maintenance of Peace Is Universally Recognized

[Nanjing] Regarding the Japanese army's failure to withdraw troops in accordance with the agreement and its repeated attacks on our garrison in Lugouqiao, the spokesman of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued the following statement: According to reports, the Japanese army did not comply with the agreed-upon measures to cease military action and refused to withdraw completely to the designated location. First, they left more than 200 troops at Wulidian northeast of Lugouqiao, and then mobilized a large number of troops, more than 1,000, to gather at Dawayao, three miles northeast of Lugouqiao. From 6 p.m. on the 10th, they continuously launched fierce attacks on our garrison in Lugouqiao. At the same time, they mobilized large armies from both inside and outside Japan, continuously sending them to Peiping and Tianjin, intending to carry out large-scale military operations. To the extent that their initial purpose has been thoroughly exposed, the Lugouqiao Incident has once again become serious, and the responsibility should naturally be borne by the Japanese side. This incident originated late at night on the 7th, when the Japanese army was illegally conducting exercises at Lugouqiao and claimed that a soldier was missing, demanding to search the city. After our side refused, they fired artillery and attacked the city, causing a conflict. It is very obvious that this was a planned and purposeful action by the Japanese side. Lugouqiao was originally not a place where foreign troops were allowed to garrison and conduct exercises according to the treaty. The illegality of their behavior is beyond doubt. In addition to the Lugouqiao garrison defending the territory and bravely resisting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Embassy, demanding that the Japanese army immediately stop its military actions, and declared that it would reserve all legitimate demands. On the other hand, the local authorities and representatives of the Japanese army negotiated, hoping for a peaceful resolution of the incident as soon as possible. It can be said that our side's painstaking efforts to maintain peace are universally recognized. Fortunately, a solution was agreed upon by both sides on the evening of the 8th: ㊀ Both sides cease military action; ㊁ The troops deployed by both sides return to their original defenses; ㊂ Lugouqiao is still garrisoned by our troops. The Japanese side claimed that the incident could be brought to an end here. Initially, it was unexpected that the so-called troop withdrawal measures were just a delaying tactic by the Japanese army, with no sincerity in resolving peace. China's national policy is to maintain peace externally and engage in production and construction internally. All outstanding issues between China and Japan are willing to be resolved peacefully through diplomatic means based on the spirit of equality and mutual benefit. It is hoped that Japan will immediately stop its military actions, abide by the previous agreement, withdraw its troops immediately, and, in order to avoid future conflicts, effectively prevent illegal garrisoning and exercises, so that the situation can improve and be resolved more easily. Otherwise, if one mistake leads to another, Japan will inevitably fail to escape its serious responsibility, and the peace and tranquility of the Far East may inevitably become more dangerous, which is not a blessing for the overall situation.

He demanded that the Japanese government be immediately telegraphed to stop the Japanese military action so that the Lugouqiao Incident could be resolved peacefully. Hidaka said that there was news that the Chinese central army was currently moving north, which the Japanese side was very uneasy about. Chen replied that he firmly believed that the Chinese army had no intention of challenging the Japanese army, but it was difficult to tolerate any foreign country arbitrarily increasing troops to China and invading China's territorial sovereignty, so it had no choice but to make normal defenses. He deeply hoped that the Japanese authorities would repent and not put China in a dangerous state. Hidaka also thought so, and bid farewell at 5:30 p.m. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)

### International Concern Arises from North China War News

German Newspaper Does Not Take Sides; American Newspaper Calls It a Dangerous Game

[Paris] Today, the spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry stated that the news of the war in North China naturally raises concerns about international repercussions. However, the information from both sides is largely contradictory. Currently, hesitation outweighs concern. We have not yet received detailed reports, so we cannot offer accurate opinions. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 11th)

[Berlin] All German newspapers are publishing news of the North China war in prominent positions. Germany does not attempt to conceal the gravity of the situation and clearly does not want to side with either party. Both sides' official statements are published equally. The "Posen Daily" carried an editorial stating that the immediate cause of the war is likely the hot weather and frayed nerves. Such wars often end in reconciliation. The peaceful outcome this time depends on both sides not overreacting. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" reported that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has trained the Chinese army into a strong force, no longer as listless as before. (Central News Agency, 11th)

[Washington] The "Washington Post" today published an editorial titled "Playing with Fire," discussing the situation that the incident near Lugou Bridge could cause. The article begins by stating that the situation in North China is very dangerous if the Kwantung Army is allowed to continue the same tactics it has employed there in recent years. It is not yet clear which side, Chinese or Japanese, initiated the conflict, but this point is very important. In the past, Japanese troops have frequently conducted night exercises near Chinese troop encampments, causing incidents. The newspaper continued, stating that Japan had a dispute with the Soviet Union a week ago and is now provoking China, demonstrating the restlessness and instability of the Japanese military. Japan's activities in North China have made China uneasy. It is unknown when the frequent Japanese exercises will turn into actual actions to expand Japan's control over North China. In fact, the Kwantung Army has expanded its control since Japan occupied Manchuria. The newspaper concludes that playing with fire is a dangerous act, especially near a powder keg.

### Necessary Steps to Defend North China

— Hua

The situation in North China has reached its most critical juncture. The commander of the garrison army has been changed from Tashiro to Kasagi. Large numbers of Kwantung Army troops have crossed the Yu Pass to Tianjin. Japanese troops are gathering in Fengtai. Japanese troops are active around Beijing. The Third Fleet has also begun special alert status. All this demonstrates that the Japanese imperialists have revealed their ambition to seize North China by force. Therefore, the previous agreement for both sides to withdraw troops in the Lugou Bridge incident was only a temporary delaying tactic on the Japanese side. Now, although our 29th Army has retreated to the west of the Yongding River, Japanese troops still occupy Lugou Bridge Station and are reinforcing in large numbers, heavily shelling our army's positions. Observing the situation, we feel that this Japanese provocation at Lugou Bridge is a planned beginning to seize the entire North China by force.

Before this Lugou Bridge incident occurred, the Japanese side widely circulated the saying "The eve of the September 18th Incident has returned." Some observers of this incident said that its effect is at least the same as the Fengtai incident of last September. From these two statements, we can also determine that this Japanese provocation is a preliminary probe for a large-scale invasion. If not for the strong resistance of our 29th Army, today's Beijing would have already become the Shenyang of the past, and the arrival of a large number of invading troops would have swept up Hebei in one fell swoop as an accomplished fact. But now, the Japanese provocation cannot fulfill its ambition due to our army's resistance. Therefore, they retreat to seek the next best thing. The Japanese side is now demanding that our army withdraw from Lugou Bridge, turning this only important station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway into a second Fengtai. However, today our country, both above and below, has recognized this lesson. It is because of last year's Fengtai incident that there is now the Lugou Bridge incident. If this Lugou Bridge incident is still resolved with the same concessions as the Fengtai incident, then the aggressors will advance step by step, constantly creating similar incidents, inevitably causing the entire North China to be dismembered piecemeal and completely fall under the control of the enemy before it is done.

Therefore, today, defending Lugou Bridge means defending the entire North China. Our authorities have previously stated that our diplomacy with Japan has a certain limit of tolerance. If this limit is crossed, then no sacrifice will be spared. Now we should take Lugou Bridge as the final limit. Our entire nation, both military and civilians, should pledge to be the backing of the 29th Army, so that the aggressors cannot cross the Lei River one step.

In addition, in terms of diplomacy, our country should make a solemn statement, announcing to the whole world so that all countries understand that the responsibility for this incident lies entirely with the Japanese side. At the same time, we should lodge a serious protest in writing to the Japanese diplomatic authorities. We know that after this incident occurred, the Japanese military authorities in North China hosted reporters and advertised extensively, causing international confusion about the location of right and wrong responsibility. But we feel that among the world powers, with the Soviet Union's direct experience, with America's deep sympathy for us, with Britain and France's concern for peace in the Far East, as long as we have a strong and upright expression, then the international community will definitely give us the greatest support. We should make the whole world understand that North China is an organic part of our country. Any attempt to invade and divide it will inevitably arouse the resistance of our entire nation.

Currently, our entire nation is watching the situation in North China with the greatest concern. The Japanese army's shelling provocation at Lugou Bridge has aroused shock and anger throughout our country. But we are resolutely responding with calm and steady steps, so that the threats and oppression of the aggressors cannot work. However, at this critical juncture, we hope that all developments regarding negotiations should be made public as much as possible, except for military secrets that cannot be disclosed. This will prevent the aggressors' one-sided propaganda from being effective, and it will also make the power of our entire people the backing of diplomacy. We must use the unified power of the entire nation to preserve North China and give the greatest blow to the ambition of the aggressors.

### Finance Minister Kong Completes Mission and Bids Farewell to American Friends

Expresses Satisfaction with American Economic Aid; Kong to Leave New York for Europe on Wednesday

[Washington] Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has held meetings with US government officials several times over the past few weeks and is scheduled to leave here tomorrow night to embark for Europe from New York. Therefore, he specially published a farewell speech to American friends today, saying that he was very honored to receive the hospitality of government leaders and important groups during this visit to the United States. He predicts that the gold and silver exchange agreement signed between China and the United States will further advance China's currency reform and also benefit the business of the two countries. "The two major countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean have always had close relations, and now they are promoting the friendship between the two countries through monetary and economic cooperation. It is expected that the trade between the two countries will increase, the currency will stabilize, and the peace and political stability of the world will benefit." Kong also thanked Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and Pierson, President of the Export-Import Bank, for granting credit to China. Kong will leave New York for Europe on Wednesday and will end everything here today and draft a report on his visit to the United States. (National Telegraph, 10th)

[Washington] Dr. Kong Xiangxi and his party are scheduled to leave New York for France on the 14th aboard the "Normandie," and then transfer from Paris to Germany for a short rest before returning home. Dr. Kong recently gave a speech to the press, expressing his satisfaction with the cooperation between US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and the Federal Reserve Bank and the Chinese Ministry of Finance to consolidate the financial foundation and develop trade between China and the United States. (Havas, 10th)

[Washington] Today's cover of the "Washington Post" carried an article by the famous political commentator Walter Lippmann, elaborating in detail on the importance of the new Kong-Morgenthau agreement to exchange US dollars for Chinese silver. The article states that this agreement, in addition to strengthening the economic ties between China and the United States, will also make China's national system more consolidated and allow it to join the ranks of the world's powers. The exact numbers of silver and gold mutually purchased by China and the United States have not yet been announced. US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Finance Minister of China, have both agreed not to announce the amount of silver and gold mutually purchased by both parties, because this move would only provide speculators with valuable information. However, according to financial sources, the so-called huge amount of gold may refer to gold worth 10 million or 50 million US dollars. Therefore, it is widely believed that the amount of gold and silver exchanged between China and the United States is probably no more than this number. According to Vice President Kong, the gold purchased by China will be kept in the United States as a reserve for China's currency. It makes no difference where the gold is stored. This gold reserve is sufficient to increase the credit of the Chinese government's monetary system. The article concludes that Sino-US trade has increased in the first month of this year, with Chinese exports to the US increasing by 30% and US exports to China increasing by 65%.

### Japanese Spies Active in Russia

Colluding with Special Envoys

[Moscow] The Communist Party newspaper "Pravda" recently published an article exposing Japanese espionage activities in the Soviet Union, saying that "a Trotskyite named Kniyazev sabotaged railway traffic as many as 15 times between 1935 and 1937. A major Japanese spy, who works at the Japanese embassy, ​​asked Kniyazev to find a way to add bacteria to military food. This plan will be implemented only when the Russo-Japanese War begins." The newspaper also said that a man named Gulbakanrif is now in Japan and is the main organizer of espionage work in the Soviet Far East Jewish Autonomous Oblast. In addition, various newspapers have continued to write articles against foreign espionage activities, with the most vehement attacks against Japanese espionage activities.

### Direct Flight from America to Russia via the Arctic

Another Russian Plane Awaits Departure

[San Francisco] The unconfirmed news was received here today that another Soviet Russian plane will depart from Moscow as soon as the weather is suitable and will still take the Arctic route for a non-stop flight to San Francisco.

### Soviet and Swedish Foreign Policies Aligned

Maintaining the Principle of Collective Security; Turkey and Russia Renew Old Ties

[Moscow] Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, who came here to visit on the 9th of this month, has recently started his return trip. (Central News Agency, 11th)

[Moscow] After the Swedish Foreign Minister visited here some time ago, an official communique was recently released, stating, "The Swedish Foreign Minister and People's Committee Chairman Molotov and Foreign Minister Litvinov held talks on the relationship between the Soviet Union and Sweden and the general international situation. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the development of normal relations between each other in politics, economics, and culture, and reiterated that both countries are determined to achieve lasting peace and security and maintain their political independence. The diplomatic policies of both countries should be based on the collective security system based on the League of Nations Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact as their fundamental principle." (Central News Agency, 11th)

[Turkish Capital] Foreign Minister Suat and Interior Minister Sukru are scheduled to arrive in Moscow on the 13th of this month to seek to renew the old ties between Turkey and Russia. Turkey and the Soviet Union have had very close relations over the years, but in recent months, the feelings of both sides have been quite cold. The Soviet side believes that the 1920 Treaty of Alliance between Russia and Turkey stipulates that the Turkish government should consult with the Soviet government on all international issues before acting, but recently, the Turkish government's various diplomatic actions have been quite independent in tendency, which is inappropriate. On the Turkish side, it is believed that the Soviet Union's interference in Turkish foreign policy is unacceptable to Turkey. Not only that, but during the Montreux Conference in June and July last year, an agreement was reached on restoring fortifications in the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. Later, when the League of Nations dealt with the dispute between France and Turkey over the cities of Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria, Russia and Turkey both expressed dissatisfaction with the positions taken by the other party. This is also the reason for the cold feelings between the two countries. This time, important Turkish figures are going to the Soviet Union, which should make up for this shortcoming. Political figures are all confident that the results of Suat and Sukru's trip will be fruitful, because in terms of political needs and geographical location, the policies of Russia and Turkey towards Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Near East should not be at odds with each other.

Iraqi Prime Minister Suleiman replied to the Higher Committee today, saying that the Iraqi government will lodge a formal protest with the British government against this plan and is willing to assist the Arabs of Palestine to achieve their goals. The King of Kuwait also sent a reply with similar wording, but the King of Transjordan, in his reply telegram, repeatedly stated that he would be the support of the Arabs, but advised the Higher Committee to study the Royal Commission's report. (Central News Agency, 11th)

[Warsaw] The Revisionist members of the Zionist Federation, totaling 200,000 people, and another 500,000 sympathizers.

Also, the holy city of Jerusalem is not included in the future Jewish state. How can we accept this? Regarding this report, Jews around the world will soon hold a referendum to express their opinions on the partition of Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state. We firmly believe that the results of the vote will show that opponents will account for the vast majority." The date and method of the vote will be decided by representatives of various groups affiliated with the Zionist Federation at a meeting in London within the next half month. Once the results of the vote are announced, they will be submitted to a temporary meeting of the League of Nations Mandates Commission before the end of July to serve as a basis for discussion.

### British Government Entrusted to Seek a Compromise

France Resolves to Abolish Border Surveillance, Gains Full Understanding from Britain

[London] After being entrusted by the Adjustment Committee to seek a compromise between the surveillance plans of Britain and France and the counter-proposals of Italy and Germany, it is generally expected that the plan to be proposed by Britain will be divided into two parts: ① Britain and France will temporarily undertake the surveillance work of the entire Spanish coast, and Italy, Germany, and other neutral countries will be invited to send observers to monitor aboard British and French surveillance warships. ② After the above temporary surveillance plan is accepted, the Adjustment Committee will study a more detailed plan, which advocates: (A) Dispatching observers to perform surveillance work in the ports belonging to both sides of the Spanish war; (B) Implementing aerial surveillance measures; (C) Withdrawing volunteers from various countries within Spain, and linking this measure to the recognition of both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerent entities. According to reports, until yesterday, Britain originally advocated implementing the second measure first. Now, it will first restore the maritime surveillance plan in the form of a compromise, so that Italy and Germany can accept it, and then it can consider the second step. London diplomatic circles now believe that this compromise plan can be accepted by Italy and Germany, because representatives from those countries, as well as representatives from the Soviet Union and Portugal, all expressed their desire to maintain the non-intervention agreement at the Adjustment Committee yesterday. If maritime surveillance can be quickly restored, the main difficulty will no longer exist. It is generally believed that the Adjustment Committee will hold a plenary meeting next Tuesday or Wednesday (i.e., the 13th or 14th of this month) to discuss the British compromise plan. (Havas News Agency, 10th, Central News Agency)

[Paris] Regarding the government's decision to suspend surveillance along the French-Spanish border in the Pyrenees Mountains from July 13th, local newspapers have rarely commented on it. The commentary in "L'Époque" can represent the general view of the newspapers, roughly stating, "This decision by France is purely a matter of national dignity and sovereignty. As for France's policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, it will not change as a result. This attitude of France is fully understood by Britain. The British government is currently seeking a compromise plan for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War and will not be constrained by France's decision." "Le Populaire" stated, "France's move is originally following in the footsteps of Portugal. Portugal's revocation of the surveillance measures on the Spanish-Portuguese border has indeed been endorsed by Germany and Italy. From now on, if fair and impartial surveillance measures cannot be restored on the land and sea borders of Spain, then we are already prepared for everything and can only restore the system of free trade with the legitimate Spanish Republican government." (Havas News Agency, 11th, Central News Agency)

### Italian and German Reactions

Saying France's Mask Has Been Removed

[Berlin] Regarding the French government's decision to suspend the implementation of surveillance on the French-Spanish border, the "Völkischer Beobachter" commented, "France has now removed its mask. Previously, France only threatened to cancel the surveillance measures, but now it has implemented it. Investigations show that France has never stopped supplying soldiers, weapons, and ammunition to the Spanish Reds. Now it has openly opened the doors to trade." In addition, the arguments of other newspapers are similar. (Havas News Agency, 11th, Central News Agency)

[Rome] The French government has decided to suspend the implementation of international surveillance measures on the border between [the country being referred to, likely Spain based on context] and Italy from the 13th of this month. "La Stampa" recently commented, "If the French government is willing to bear the full responsibility for the complete failure of the non-intervention policy, then Italy should restore free action, transport weapons to the Spanish National Army, and send warships to escort Italian ships to retaliate in case of attack." In the semi-official Italian view, the French government's stubborn attitude has indeed fallen into isolation. For example, "Il Giornale d'Italia" reported that the British and French surveillance plans have failed, and France, out of frustration, has made the above decision. "Il Lavoro Fascista" stated, "When will France have another Joan of Arc emerge to sever the bonds of the French-Russian mutual assistance pact in one fell swoop?" (Havas News Agency, 10th, Central News Agency)

[Berlin] The semi-official German News Agency recently published a dispatch from Paris, only announcing that the French government has temporarily suspended the French-Spanish border surveillance measures from the 13th of this month. However, it did not mention that the implementation of this decision by France depends on whether the surveillance measures at the [likely French and Spanish] border can be restored, and that France should continue to abide by the non-intervention agreement. After the above news was released, German newspapers used it as a basis to launch fierce attacks on France. Subsequently, although a Havas News Agency reporter requested the news agency to correct it, it still did not comply by midnight. (Havas News Agency, 10th, Central News Agency)

### Eden Travels to France

This trip by Eden seems to indicate that the current tense situation has eased. (National Maritime Telegram, 10th)

### Endless Troubles in Spain

The Civil War Will Soon Reach Its First Anniversary; Government Troops Achieve Victory in Counteroffensive Near the Capital

Madrid: The Spanish Civil War began on July 18th last year, and it is now less than a week away from its anniversary. Battles on various front lines are becoming more active again. (Havas News Agency, 10th, Central News Agency)

Andaye: After the Spanish government forces launched a large-scale offensive, there is intense fighting northwest of Madrid. The government issued a communique last night stating that it had achieved a great victory and recovered the three important towns of Brunete, Villanueva de la Cañada, and Quijorna. However, news from the Nationalist forces in Salamanca claimed that 45,000 government troops attacked for three days without success, losing 10,000 men, including 4,000 killed in action. (Reuters, 11th, Central News Agency)

[Paris] Regarding rumors of a possible mediation between the two sides of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish Embassy in France issued a special communique to deny it, stating, "The Spanish government believes that there is absolutely no possibility of mediation between the legitimate government and the rebellious elements." (Havas News Agency, 10th, Central News Agency)

### Contents of the New Franco-German Trade Agreement

Tariff Reciprocity, Exchange of Coal and Iron

[Paris] The detailed contents of the Franco-German trade agreement signed today have now been announced, including agreements on goods, payment methods, and goods transportation. It is generally based on the Franco-German agreement of June 28, 1934. The new agreement will take effect from August 1st of this year and will be valid for two years, until July 31, 1939. The most significant differences between the new treaty and the old agreement are: ① Both parties pay in cash for transactions, without using clearing agreements; ② Trade calculations are based on German exports as the standard, and the repayment plan is based on the estimated annual German exports, which will reach approximately 324,000 marks in 1937, equivalent to 3,180,000,000 francs. The following three items must be deducted from this amount: ① Unexpected expenses; ② Repayment of the French suspension agreement; ③ Balance clearing of goods transactions. As for the value of French goods exported to Germany each year, it remains 1,637,000,000 francs, or 156,500,000 marks, approximately 13,000,000 marks per month. In addition, the trade agreement expands the quota and reduces certain important tariffs. The most-favored-nation treatment clause has been retained, but the tax rates for some goods have also been determined, with both increases and decreases. The most significant fact is the trade in coking coal. In the future, France's coking coal will be entirely supplied by Germany, with Germany exporting at least 275,000 tons of coal per month to France, and France will exchange it with 7,200,000 tons of iron ore per year.

Therefore, a Air Defense and Gas Defense Exhibition was held during the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government to arouse public attention. The "Shanghai Evening Post" recently published a speech on air defense and gas defense given by British Member of Parliament Lloyd George at the London Wireless Radio Station, which is excerpted below for reference. Reading it can show that this matter is closely related to every citizen, and we should prepare for a rainy day to avoid any mistakes. Digging a well when you are thirsty is not feasible. Furthermore, this matter cannot be completely relied upon by the government. All citizens should rise up to help the government so that it can easily achieve success. In fact, helping the government is helping your own family and yourself.

People sometimes ask me (Lloyd George referring to himself, hereinafter the same), why is the government now engaged in manufacturing gas masks and arranging various other air defense preparations? The answer is very simple. We hope never to see war again in the future. We hope that enemy planes will never attack our towns. We hope that no poisonous gas will be dropped on our people. However, today's bombers, with their speed, range, and carrying capacity, are far from comparable to those of 1918. We must deal with this fact, so we should know that without air defense preparations, the consequences of an air raid will inevitably be tragic.

The key point to realize today is that this kind of preparation requires a precise organization and a foundation of perfect equipment to be effective. It cannot be provided hastily when danger comes. Therefore, the organization and equipment prepared in the security policy are precautions to be used in case of emergency. We are currently focusing on this point.

During an air raid, for various reasons, the safe place for civilians is a room with some simple precautions indoors, such as pasting paper over window holes and covering the gaps with soaked newspapers to prevent poisonous gas from entering. This shelter room can be called the first line of defense, but we must also prepare a second line of defense, which is a gas mask, to prevent the shelter room from being damaged and to be used by people outdoors to reach a safe place.

Because of these incidents, the government decided that all people in danger during the war, regardless of wealth or ability to purchase, should have a gas mask. Therefore, how to design and manufacture a simple and effective gas mask that can be mass-produced in the millions became a new and difficult problem that scientists and technical experts painstakingly researched. After a long period of testing, government experts completed their work, so I was able to announce in Congress a few months ago that the government has stored a large number of gas masks, which will be distributed free of charge to every citizen in areas at risk of attack in the event of an emergency. Since I announced this, the work of manufacturing gas masks has been actively underway and very rapid. Trial manufacturing has indeed been going on for several weeks now, with a weekly output of 15,000 filter canisters, which will soon be increased to 2 million per month. The number of completed filter canisters currently prepared is in the hundreds of thousands, and the number of masks is in the millions.

These gas masks will be stored throughout the country and can be distributed very quickly to the entire population before an emergency actually occurs when they are needed. Manchester has a large storage facility that is now filling up quickly. The first batch of gas masks will be transported to London in a few days, and other provincial capitals will have storage facilities established in a few weeks. London will have a large portion of the gas masks needed stored by Christmas. Having all citizens in the capital of the world equipped with gas masks will make Britain the first country. At the same time, storage facilities in various provinces across the country will also be full of gas masks. After a short delay, we will also find ways to allow people who are willing to try on the new gas masks themselves to try them on. This is probably what you are happy to hear.

I would like to let you know that this gas mask has undergone real tests and can defend against all kinds of poisonous gases that the government knows can be used in war without fail. Captain Hothusoul and I have recently worn these masks several times and walked into a special test chamber filled with poisonous gas. We were safe and sound and felt nothing.

Finally, I would like you to know that the equipment of this gas mask, although extremely important, is only one aspect of the national passive air defense system under construction throughout the country. Local committees are currently preparing to organize preliminary casualty stations, rescue teams, gas reconnaissance teams, gas decontamination teams, and improved fire-fighting equipment to deal with incendiary bombs, limit other plans.

The Gas Defense School established by the Ministry of Internal Affairs is training local people to limit local personnel so that they can return to their local areas and train their colleagues. The Railway and Port Authorities, large public companies, and many other commercial firms are all managing their own air defense plans. In short, the organization of air defense preparations is now moving forward day by day.

I have one last word to tell you that local committees will soon recruit volunteer teams to assist in the organization of air defense preparations, and several places have already implemented it. What I am happy to say is that, on the whole, the people have responded with great satisfaction, and I very much hope that this satisfactory response will continue unabated and be promoted throughout the country. In this important task of air defense, we have proven that although Britain handles this matter on a voluntary basis, the results achieved can match those of other countries, even if they cannot surpass them.

During the battle talk, a representative from the British Wireless Radio Corporation came to the microphone and offered the audience the recording of his speech made that day in the poisonous gas chamber. He said:

While we were making this recording, we were actually standing in the dense smoke of poisonous gas. We borrowed a mobile poisonous gas vehicle from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to do this description. We walked into the car through a canvas-covered, airtight passage. This kind of police car is specially used to train police officers from various departments so that they know the intricacies of gas masks and poisonous gas. I stood nervously in a corner like a Martian alien, while a police inspector prepared to ignite his handbag containing poisonous gas. (To be continued)

### The Wanping Incident Turns for the Worse

Japanese Army Launches a Large-Scale Encirclement of the County Seat; Young Officers Disapprove of Troop Withdrawal; 2,000 Soldiers from the Kwantung Army Arrive at Yuguan Awaiting Advancement

Tianjin Dispatch: The Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident on the 10th suddenly worsened again. News from the vicinity of Wanping and Fengtai remains unclear. The sound of artillery fire has been heard intermittently within the city of Beiping. The transportation between Tianjin was cut off at 3:00 PM on the 10th. A comprehensive report from various sources is as follows:

Conflict Rekindles

Around 2:00 AM on the 10th, over two hundred Japanese soldiers who had not withdrawn were positioned on the high ground northeast of the culvert outside the east gate of Wanping. They suddenly opened fire on our security forces inside the city with machine guns for twenty minutes. After the Japanese military advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, Nakajima, along with Wanping Commissioner Wang Lengzhai, negotiated with the Japanese army, the Japanese side claimed that two dead Japanese soldiers had not been found and that they needed to enter the city to search. They also claimed that the security forces had fired first due to a misunderstanding, thus their actions were defensive. After 7:00 AM that morning, Japanese troops from Tongzhou and Tianjin reinforced Fengtai. The Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai, about three hundred soldiers, moved towards Wulidian. Around 3:00 PM, three Japanese airplanes flew from Tianjin to the Lugouqiao, the right bank of the Yongding River, and above Wanping County, circling for reconnaissance for about twenty minutes before departing. At 5:00 PM, the Japanese troops in Fengtai continued to send a train with artillery, adding over two hundred soldiers to the front of Lugouqiao. At 5:10 PM, they launched a fierce attack on our 29th Army on the right bank of the Yongding River and the security forces inside Wanping City. The attack paused slightly around 6:00 PM, then resumed at 7:00 PM, launching a large-scale encirclement of Wanping County. The intensity of the artillery fire was greater than before. Our troops had no choice but to fight back, resulting in heavy casualties. After twenty minutes, the Japanese troops stopped their attack. At 7:30 PM, the artillery bombardment resumed, accompanied by machine gun fire and charges, all of which were resolutely repelled by our troops. After 8:00 PM, although the sound of artillery fire continued, the direction could not be distinguished due to the darkness, and the attack gradually subsided.

Japanese Troops Assemble

From the 10th onwards, Japanese troops successively assembled. Troops from Tongzhou, Tangshan, Tianjin, and Tanggu were dispatched to Fengtai in batches, and then transferred from Fengtai to Lugouqiao. Their headquarters seemed to be in Fengtai, while the forward command post was in Longwangmiao, and the artillery base was in Wulidian. The Japanese troops stationed in Qinhuangdao, Yuguan, and Nandasi were concentrated in Tangshan and had requisitioned vehicles from the Beining Railway to transport them to Tangshan and Tanggu in batches, and then proceed to Fengtai by land. On the 10th, both morning and afternoon, the Japanese troops originally stationed in Tongzhou, due to their defenses being taken over by troops from Tangshan and Tanggu, dispatched over three hundred soldiers to Fengtai. The Suzuki Independent Artillery Regiment stationed in Tianjin, with over three hundred soldiers, also along with the Kayashima Infantry Second Regiment with over three hundred soldiers, took heavy trucks to Fengtai. Therefore, as of the evening of the 10th, the Japanese troops assembled in Fengtai numbered about two thousand, of which over six hundred had gone to Wulidian and Lugouqiao. Hebian, the commander of the infantry regiment stationed in Beiping, went to Wulidian to command on the afternoon of the 9th. Battalion Commander Morita was on the left bank of the Yongding River, commanding the attack on our 29th Army. Military vehicle activity became more active, and the main force of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin was preparing for an emergency deployment. If the fighting intensified, they would be dispatched to reinforce. From 6:00 AM to 1:00 PM on the 10th, over two thousand soldiers from the Kwantung Army stationed in Jinzhou and Suizhong arrived at Yuguan on five trains, parked at the station, awaiting orders to advance. The pseudo-Fengshan Railway was also mobilizing vehicles to transport troops.

Situation Takes a Sudden Turn

Hashimoto, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army Headquarters stationed in Tianjin, met with Japanese Brigade Commander Hebian and battalion commanders Morita, Katada, and Ichiki in Fengtai on the 9th, conveying the intentions of Japanese Army Commander Tashiro. Originally, he planned to go to Beiping immediately to convene Wachi, Matsui, Imai, and others to discuss methods for handling the aftermath. Unexpectedly, young officers believed that such understanding would damage the prestige of the Imperial Army and feared that it would cause the 29th Army to despise the Japanese army, making it impossible to subdue them in the future. Therefore, they all advocated for decisive retaliation to demonstrate the might of the Imperial Army. At the same time, the Kwantung Army adopted a strong stance, urging the young officers of the Japanese army stationed in North China to take action to subdue [omission]. Therefore, Hashimoto's mission was constrained by the young officers, and he could only inspect the troops in Fengtai, comfort the wounded soldiers, and leave for Beiping in the afternoon of the 10th. The Japanese did not meet with our authorities. The Japanese army attacked Lugouqiao again, repeatedly, under the unilateral decisions of Hebian, Wachi, Matsui, Katada, and Ichiki, etc. Their actions also became more aggressive. Japanese Army Commander Tashiro had almost completely lost his ability to control his subordinates. At 11:00 PM on the night of the 10th, the Japanese Army Headquarters even issued a statement, stating that "at 5:10 PM, 7:00 PM, and 7:30 PM on the 10th, the 29th Army fired on Japanese troops at Lugouqiao and Yaomenkou with howitzers from across the river. If any major unfortunate events occur as a result, all responsibility will be borne by the Chinese side." Judging by their intentions, it seems to be shifting responsibility to our side and providing a pretext for a large-scale attack. Therefore, there is general concern here that this incident will escalate beyond control.

Transportation Cut Again

The transportation between Beiping and Tianjin, which had resumed at 7:00 AM on the 10th, with each train only able to re-enter Beiping's Qianmen Station at 7:00 AM and the first train from Beiping to Tianjin also having to depart after 7:00 AM, became tense again around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th. The Yongdingmen railway tracks were once again dismantled by our troops, and the transportation between Beiping and Tianjin was interrupted again. Passenger trains heading to Beiping all turned back to Tianjin after reaching Fengtai. After 9:00 PM, even transportation between Tianjin and Fengtai was cut off. Many Japanese soldiers were crowded at Fengtai Station. The station's telephone room was guarded by Japanese soldiers. A large amount of Japanese ammunition was piled up at the station. Passengers had to undergo inspection. However, Beiping-Tianjin telephone lines remained open, although making calls was still extremely difficult. People in Tianjin became increasingly panicked. Police Chief Li Wentian convened a meeting of all branch chiefs and security team leaders at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th to discuss strict measures to maintain public order in the city, deciding on eight items, including conducting a census starting immediately and completing it within a week. Suspicious persons would be interrogated immediately. Congested residences would not be allowed to harbor idlers. Each district would liaise with each other to ensure close security. The management of lights could be ordered to be extinguished if necessary.

A Glimmer of Hope

Until the night of the 10th, Qin Dechun was still making efforts for peace, constantly consulting with Japanese special service organ officials Matsui and military attache Imai, and Second Section Chief Wachi, etc., to discuss ceasefire methods and follow-up procedures. Wanping Commissioner Wang Lengzhai, Hebei-Chahar Political Council Advisor Nakajima, and Sakurai were all in Beiping, working hard all night to negotiate. If there is a glimmer of hope, the authorities are determined to uphold the principle of peace and friendship, turning hostility into harmony. If the other party's oppression is excessive, leaving us no room for maneuver, we will have to risk everything, even at the cost of sacrifice. It is said that on the night of the 10th, Qin Dechun conveyed this intention to the Japanese side, hoping that the other party would be warned. Chairman Feng Zhaonian is scheduled to return to Baoding early on the 11th, and Qin Dechun will be responsible for all negotiations. (12:30 AM on the 11th)

### A Scene of Troop Withdrawal Negotiations

Tianjin Dispatch: Late at night on the 8th, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a new instruction to Tianjin regarding the attack on Lugouqiao by the Japanese army stationed in Fengtai. Tashiro, the Japanese army commander stationed in Tianjin, convened an emergency meeting at the commander's residence in Zhangyuan in the Japanese Concession, discussing it for a long time. After deciding on a method, he immediately telegraphed Wachi, Matsui, Imai, and others in Beiping to inform them, and ordered Oomoto, the chief of the First Section of the headquarters, along with staff officers Asai and Senda, to depart by steamship at 5:00 AM on the 9th to convey the order to the Japanese army at the front in Fengtai. At the same time, Wachi, Imai, Matsui, and others, based on Tashiro's instructions, held several talks with our officials Qin Dechun, Feng Zhian, and Zhang Zizhong from about 1:00 AM on the 9th. Both sides agreed to first withdraw troops to resolve the wartime situation, and then convene a meeting to negotiate future issues. At 5:30 AM on the 9th, a five-point troop withdrawal method was finalized: the 29th Army battalion stationed in Lugouqiao would first withdraw from the city and assemble on the right bank of the Yongding River; then, three companies of soldiers would retreat to Gu'an County, and one company would remain in villages outside the city within Wanping County. The Japanese army would first retreat to Zhaoxinzhuang and, after the 29th Army had retreated to the so-called appropriate location, would completely retreat back to their original defense area in Fengtai. The defense of Lugouqiao City would be filled by three hundred men from Shi Yousan's Hebei Security Brigade. At around 1:00 AM on the 9th, while the negotiations were underway, the sound of gunfire from the Japanese army gathered outside Lugouqiao City continued intermittently. Our defending troops remained calm until 5:40 AM, when the 29th Army, based on the agreement between the two sides, sent Ho Jifeng, the commander of the 110th Brigade of the 37th Division, along with Zhou Yongye, the director of the Communications Department of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters, by car to Lugouqiao to meet with the Japanese military advisors to the 29th Army, Nakajima and Sakurai, Wanping Commissioner Wang Lengzhai, Lin Gengyu, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and the battalion commanders Morita, Katada, and Ichiki of the First and Second Battalions of the Japanese Infantry First Regiment, the deputy director of the special service organ stationed in Beiping, Terahira, and the commander of the Beiping Gendarmerie, Akato, to jointly discuss and monitor the troop withdrawal of both sides. At this time, Shi Yousan led three hundred security troops to fill the defense, driving in heavy trucks. The Japanese army mistakenly thought that reinforcements from the 29th Army in the city had arrived and opened fire. Shi's troops quickly got out of the vehicles and lay down in skirmish lines on the ground to avoid bullets, but one soldier was killed. Our troops in the city, seeing the Japanese army open fire, also mistakenly thought that the Japanese side was unwilling to withdraw troops and opened fire as well. As a result, gunfire erupted. By 8:00 AM, Oomoto, Asai, and Senda had arrived from Tianjin and participated in the negotiations. Both sides then tried their best to stop the attack. At 8:45 AM, they retreated according to the agreement. After our troops retreated to the right bank of the Yongding River to assemble, after Shi Yousan's troops entered the city to complete the deployment, one company was left in a small village near the city, and the rest retreated to Gu'an. The Japanese army first retreated to Zhaoxinzhuang, several kilometers away from Lugouqiao, and then returned to Fengtai around 10:00 AM. After 10:00 AM, the wartime situation began to ease. However, a small number of Japanese cavalry were still trying to patrol the Hun River and monitor the movements of our troops.

Since the troops of both sides have been withdrawn, the two sides will hold a joint meeting in Pingzhong to discuss subsequent matters. Hashimoto Gun, the chief of staff of the Japanese army stationed in North China, took a ride on the Beining passenger train with his staff officer Tsukada and the affiliated Suzuki to Ping in the afternoon of the ninth. However, because the car could only drive to Fengtai, he got off at Fengtai at about 6:00 PM and transferred to Lugouqiao to investigate the situation after the withdrawal of troops by both sides, and met with Morita, Katada, Ichiki, etc. After giving some instructions, he turned to Beiping in the evening to meet the two generals, Hebian and Mutaguchi, exchanged opinions, and then planned to call Wachi, Matsui, Imai, Asai, Senda, Oomoto, and others to hold a meeting to determine the future negotiation steps. It is said that because Wachi will be transferred to the first section chief of the Japanese army stationed in North China, he is actually the backbone staff of the main battle section of the headquarters. Hashimoto and others will respect his opinions and ask our side for compensation, condolences, and apologies. On the night of the 9th, Chinese and Japanese personnel were still negotiating in Pingzhong. Although the Japanese army had withdrawn to Fengtai, it was still making vocational preparations. On the night of the 8th, the headquarters of the Japanese army stationed in North China had repeatedly asked the Beining Road Bureau for vehicles to transport troops to Fengtai, but was rejected by the Road Bureau. On the morning of the 9th, a batch of chemical warfare troops, about two hundred people, took heavy trucks to Fengtai along the Beining Road. At 6:40 in the evening, another 30 Japanese soldiers and 8 horses escorted a train of military supplies from Nandasi to Tianjin, and transported them to Fengtai overnight in heavy trucks. The Japanese army gathered in Fengtai currently has more than 1,300 people. On the evening of the 9th, they asked the Road Bureau for vehicles to drive to Beiping, but the Road Bureau did not respond. Therefore, Beiping closed its four doors at 7:00 PM on the 9th and imposed martial law ahead of schedule. People generally do not dare to be optimistic about this situation.

The long-distance telephone between Tianjin and Ping was still crowded on the 9th and it was not easy to get through. Although the telegraph line was intact, there were few users. From 7:00 AM, there was heavy rain in Ping and Tianjin at the same time and it did not clear all day. The conflict between the two sides on the 9th was not so fierce, which may be due to the heavy rain. The 21st passenger train from Fengtai to Tianjin in the morning was sparsely seated. The 22nd passenger train from Tianjin to Ping at 7:00 AM also only reached Fengtai and there were not many passengers. The 42nd and 4th passenger trains from Tianjin to Ping at 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM, respectively, had the section of track near Yongdingmen that was demolished repaired at 5:00 PM on the same day. However, because Beiping temporarily advanced martial law to prevent accidents, the 42nd and 4th passenger trains still only went to Fengtai. The 3rd passenger train and the 1st through train from Ping to Shanghai were all advanced to before 6:00 PM according to the prescribed time. The Tianjin-Tangshan, Tianjin-Yuguan, Ping-Shenyang, and Tianjin-Pukou passenger trains were all changed to depart from Tianjin Station according to the schedule. The through trains that should have driven to Beiping stopped at Tianjin Station and were scheduled to depart one after another after 3:00 AM on the 10th, and arrive after Beiping lifted martial law and the city gates opened at about 7:00 AM. If there is no tension on the 10th, the transportation between Ping and Tianjin should be restored.

The Japanese concession here is quite nervous because they don't know where they got their information. Since the late hours of the 8th, all detectives have been dispatched to guard all important intersections, and sandbags have been piled up and electric nets have been set up in remote streets and alleys, and security posts have been added. On the morning of the 9th, the Acting Police Chief Kawatori convened an emergency meeting and decided to divide the entire concession into five districts, and the Japanese police and the Japanese volunteer team [In rural areas, soldiers] jointly divided the districts and were responsible for defense. At 1:00 PM, the Japanese Gendarmerie sent a camp to visit Li Wentian, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, requesting attention to public security in the city. Li promised to take precautions. In the afternoon, dozens of Japanese wounded soldiers from the Lugouqiao front were transported to Tianjin by train and heavy vehicles. (Midnight on the 9th)

### Songjiang

Continued Report on the Anti-Xiong Movement

Since the county education director was commissioned by the provincial office to bear the height of Xiong Zhugao, all circles have risen up in opposition. Now I know that the academic and educational circles of Jiangyin County have also sent a letter to Xiong, the original letter is as follows: "To Mr. Xiong Zhugao, the leader of the Education Department, how about the results of your teaching in our city for several years? Why were you driven out? Now that you have left your job and left with a full load, you can enjoy yourself for the rest of your life without worrying about being frozen or starving. Now, why do you have to go to Songjiang again, which has aroused opposition from the people of the city? The newspapers have reported this, and you can be aware of it. Even if you go with a thick face, you will only cause trouble in Songjiang as you did in Jiangyin. I hope you will rein in your horse before the cliff, it is fortunate."

Escaped Prisoner Captured in Shanghai

The notorious thief, Pei Liu, escaped from prison on December 12th of last year. It has been half a year. Recently, I learned that the criminal was hiding in Shanghai, so on the 9th of this month, the police station sent personnel to Shanghai to join the Gordon Road Patrol Room, and captured Pei and his wife, Xu, on the floor of No. 1298, Pinlang Road, in the Public Concession. Songdi Court ordered the police to go to Shanghai, submit a document, and bring the two criminals to Song and bring them to justice.

### Hangzhou

End of Hangzhou-Caoe Section Project

The Hangzhou-Caoe section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has completed about one-third of the track laying project, and is now speeding up the laying in four sections to complete it by the end of the month. Most of the station ticket offices along the way have been completed, only the Xiaoshan Station ticket office started construction slightly later and needs to be completed at the beginning of next month. Because there are many rivers along the line, there are a total of 77 large and small bridges. The bridge body has already been built, and all the steel beams were erected on the 10th. However, the bridge piers of the Caoe River Bridge are limited to completion within a month, and the steel frame materials are being supplied in time. It can be completed by the middle of next month. The engineering office is now preparing to close, and will transfer the unfinished project to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau at the end of the month to continue handling it.

### Wuxi

Opening of Scenic Area Bus

The Yixi long-distance bus is run by Jiangnan Company, and its business is quite developed. Now, Stationmaster Liu of the Wuxi Station, because tourists from all over come to Wuxi for sightseeing, hiring rickshaws is quite inconvenient. In order to make it easier to visit the scenic area, he plans to open a special bus for the scenic area. He has specially applied to the Nanjing General Company for approval, and a station will be opened in Huishan. It is scheduled to officially sell tickets on the 15th of this month, and the fare is 1.2 points.

### Zhenjiang

Construction of Sanhua Road Branch Line

The Xiaoxian Gushan Dazhong Coal Mine, jointly established by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Shanghai merchant Lu Zidong, has achieved good results since its opening. It is now heard that the mine has agreed with the Jinpu Railway Bureau to build a railway branch line from Sanbu Township to Huajiaosi in the mine site, which is 60 Huali long, and requires 500,000 yuan. Shandazhong and the Road Bureau share the costs and have named it the Sanhua Branch Line. The Road Bureau has already started surveying, and will soon circle and purchase people's land, and is determined to start construction within this year to facilitate the transportation of the coal mine.

### Jiashan

Strange Plane Comes to Territory to Drop Bombs

At 3:00 PM on the 9th, a white-shell plane came from the sky, with obvious red markings on the wings. It then proceeded to the border between Jinjiabang and Jiejinggang in Lijiaqiao Town and dropped a bomb, which happened to be in the paddy field, so it did not explode. Some farmers reported to the 7th Squadron of the town's water police, who forwarded it to the county government, which sent personnel to conduct an on-site survey.

### Zhuji

Students Enlist in the Army

Qiu Zuyi's son, Shunfa, a resident of Tianle Township, Zhuji, is 28 years old and is a student at Hangzhou Middle School. He usually has a sense of patriotism. This time, Japan provoked in Lugouqiao, and our army defended and resisted, resulting in a conflict between the two sides. The student left his parents on the 9th and enlisted in the army.

### Director Li Discusses the 29th Army's Determination to Defend the Territory

Japanese Provocation is a Premeditated Plan; The Strength of the 29th Army is Sufficient to Cope; Qin Dechun and Others Telegraphed War Situation Yesterday Morning; The Press Will Be Invited to Report in the Coming Days

Xin Sheng News Agency reports that since the Japanese army replayed the old trick of Fengtai at Lugouqiao, the news has spread, and people here are all indignant and looking north, their blood boiling. The 29th Army is extremely grateful for the successive telegrams of condolences and support from all walks of life. Li Guang'an, the army's office director stationed in Shanghai, will invite the press in the coming days to report the details and express his gratitude. Yesterday morning, the office also received a telegram from Qin Dechun and others reporting the situation of our army's resistance to the Japanese army's provocation. The original text reads: "To Director Li Guang'an, the office director of the 29th Army stationed in Shanghai, Brother Guang'an, the Japanese army, with a large force of more than a thousand, more than 20 artillery pieces, and more than 30 machine guns, concentrated on Da Waya, about three miles northeast of Lugouqiao, and then launched several violent attacks on our Lugouqiao position, and seized part of the Lugou Iron Bridge, all of which were resolutely repelled by our army. The gunfight gradually subsided at 6:30 PM. Special report, Brother Qin Dechun, Feng Zhian, Zhang Zizhong, knock on the steamer and ginseng."

According to Shenshi News Agency, Li Guang'an recently made a statement to reporters, saying that the spirit of the officers and soldiers of the 29th Army to be loyal and defend the country has long been known to the people of the country, and they have the determination to sacrifice. When Chairman Song took responsibility for Hebei and Chahar, all officers and soldiers had this belief. The reason why the Japanese army has always been critical of the 29th Army, creating rumors and provoking, is nothing more than for this reason. The Wanping incident this time was completely a premeditated plan by the Japanese. At first, they wanted to provoke the 29th Army to retreat with a small number of troops, and then they exerted pressure with all the forces of the North China Garrison Army. But because all failed, and at the same time, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council decided to deal with the Japanese side according to the government's instructions, there were unreasonable attacks on both of the past two days. According to various reports, in addition to the North China Garrison Army, most of the Kwantung Army has also entered the pass and concentrated on Langfang Fengtai. This kind of urgent action of continuous reinforcement is nothing but a pre-determined plan. But since our army has the determination to defend the territory and defend the country, it should spare no sacrifice under the leadership of the government and resist to the end. In terms of strength, it is sufficient to cope.

### Sun Ke Discusses the Lugouqiao Incident's Potential for Expansion

The Central Government is Determined Not to Lose Another Inch of Land; Song Zheyuan's Will is Firm and He is Willing to Swear to Defend to the Death

Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence yesterday afternoon. According to the discussion of the Lugouqiao incident, I and Foreign Minister Wang and others heard about this news in Lushan, and had discussions with Chairman Chiang and others. The initial intention was that the situation would not expand and could be resolved peacefully on the spot. Unexpectedly, while the Japanese side was conducting peaceful negotiations, on the other hand, they sent the Kwantung Army to greatly reinforce it, pretending to cease fire, but actually using it as a delaying tactic. Last night and this morning, they continued to attack us. I recently received a long-distance call from Foreign Minister Wang, who observed that the war may expand. Now the central government is determined not to lose another inch of land. Song Zheyuan's will is firm. If the Japanese side continues to press, he is determined to swear to defend to the death. My trip to Guangdong is to take advantage of the summer recess of the Legislative Yuan to return to my ancestral home in Zhongshan to visit my mother and take care of private affairs. I may have to go to Qiongyai to inspect. I originally planned to leave in the coming days, but now I have to wait for news of the war in the north before I can leave. I will stay in Shanghai to wait for the ship to go south and will not return to Beijing before leaving. Sun also said that the symposiums convened by Chairman Chiang and Chairman Wang for academic experts and leaders from all walks of life will be held as usual and will not be affected by the war in the north. The government personnel who participate are designated by the Central Political Committee. The reason why the central leaders went to Lu one after another was to discuss official business separately and there was no special meeting convened, etc.

### Japanese Third Fleet Flagship Izumo Arrives in Shanghai

Temporarily Stationed in Shanghai for Alert

The Japanese Third Fleet flagship Izumo, was ordered to sail to Shanghai yesterday morning (11th). It entered Songkou at 5:10 and docked at the Bund outside Edward Road at 6:00. According to Japanese news, the Izumo will temporarily prepare for stationing in Shanghai. Commander Hasegawa Kiyoshi of the Japanese First Fleet in China took the Izumo flagship from Shanghai to Qingdao last month, and then turned to Taiwan to inspect various domestic warships. The Lugouqiao incident occurred this time, and a Japanese telegram came, and the Japanese Ministry of the Navy ordered the fleet to be on alert in unison, under the pretext of protecting the bridges and people in various places. Hasegawa was ordered to return to Shanghai on the original warship, entered the port at 5:10 yesterday morning, and berthed in front of the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road, the dock of the Japanese Mail Company. According to the head of Kawatani, he will stay in Shanghai temporarily. Next Thursday, there will be a new transfer order to Shanghai from the Foreign Affairs Department, and then the future trends will be decided. According to the Zilin Bao, Lieutenant General Hasegawa, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese Third Fleet in Chinese waters, was ordered by the Tokyo Ministry of the Navy to return to Shanghai on his flagship from Taiwan today (Sunday). The Tokyo instruction was issued on Thursday, ordering him to take all necessary measures to protect the life and property of the Japanese Bridges along the coast and along the river in China, so the lieutenant general will probably stay in Shanghai for a certain period of time.

### Wu Tiecheng Invites Shanghai Financial Circles to Guangdong for Inspection

Cultural and Economic Circles Especially Welcome the Visit, Wu to Fly to Lushan on the 13th to Meet Chiang

Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, accompanied by Zhang Yuanruo, a member of the design committee, and Li Dachao, a section chief, to attend the 10th Anniversary Celebration of the Municipal Government and the National Congress of the China Cultural Construction Association. Having completed these matters, he is now scheduled to fly to Nanjing tomorrow morning (the 13th), and then to Lushan to meet with Chairman Chiang, to report on the administration of Guangdong Province and seek instructions. Mr. Li Dachao may accompany him. It is understood that one of the important tasks of Wu's visit to Shanghai this time is to solicit the Shanghai financial community to jointly invest in the development of rural construction in Guangdong Province. The current priority of Guangdong Province is the implementation of last year's rural construction plan, which requires a huge amount of funds. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency visited Mr. Li Dachao yesterday. According to him, Chairman Wu has announced the policy of Guangdong Province, whose outline is divided into politics, economy, culture, and rural areas. Among these four aspects, rural areas are particularly important. In terms of loans, the Guangdong banking sector also pays close attention to rural construction and regards it as a fundamental task. Therefore, it has organized a syndicate to prepare to invest in rural areas. The funds are expected to be 30 million yuan, so there has been no mention of borrowing from Shanghai. However, he requested that the Shanghai banking and financial circles organize an inspection team to Guangdong. Since Chairman Wu has old friendships with all circles in Shanghai, he not only specifically invites the banking sector to Guangdong, but also welcomes all sectors such as culture, rural areas, and economy to enter Guangdong for inspection and study good plans, in order to promote the new construction, he said.

### Municipal Government Plans to Establish a Factory for Local Opium Addicts

Planning a Thorough Solution to the City's Opium Problem

The Shanghai Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee and the Municipal Police Department have recently compiled statistics on the occupations of registered opium addicts. More than 80% are workers and unemployed vagrants. Moreover, these opium addicts, due to long-term physical damage and loss of ambition, are unable to produce, which often leads to their degradation. Therefore, after being dissuaded by the authorities, they repeatedly relapse in a short period of time. If a fundamental solution is not sought, its impact on national physique, national livelihood, and social tranquility will be enormous. Recently, the Municipal Police Department has found an increase in the number of relapsed offenders as a result of its investigation. The reason is that it has failed to isolate the reformed opium addicts from the adverse environment. Even if the authorities impose severe penalties, it is not easy to change their environment and reform their minds and bodies. In view of the fact that Jiangsu Province has established opium addict vocational training factories in its anti-smoking work to solve this difficulty, which can be used as a reference, the Shanghai anti-smoking authorities have sent personnel to Nantong, Tongzhou and other places for inspection. After the inspection was completed, the details of the inspection have been reported to the Municipal Government for approval. The Municipal Authorities have started preparations to establish a factory for local opium addicts based on this report, so that the city's anti-smoking work can achieve a more thorough effect, it is said.

### Xu Shiying Strives to Work Despite Illness After the Lugouqiao Incident

—Sends Huang Bodu as Representative to Beijing for Instructions—

Xu Shiying, the ambassador to Japan, has been receiving medical treatment daily since his otitis media relapsed recently. He is also following his doctor's advice to decline seeing guests and is recuperating quietly at his residence on Laoshenfu Road. However, after the news of the Lugouqiao Incident was received, Xu felt very distressed and his spirits suddenly rose. Although he was ill, he still strove to work, listening to information from all sides, paying attention to the development of the incident, and communicating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telephone every day. He also telegraphed the embassy in Tokyo, instructing everything. Xu originally intended to rush to Nanjing to discuss important matters with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in person, but due to his weak physical strength and the doctor's firm instructions, it was temporarily inappropriate for him to move. Therefore, he sent Huang Bodu, a secretary of the embassy in Japan, as a representative to Beijing to contact and request instructions. Huang originally planned to enter Beijing the night before last, but since yesterday was a regular holiday and many inconveniences would arise after arriving in Beijing, he temporarily postponed it until 1:00 AM last night when he took the night train to Beijing.

### Postal Workers' Union and Others Send Telegrams to Military Authorities Urging Determination to Resist and Defend the Country

National Postal Workers' General Union

To General Song Zheyuan and General Feng Zhian in Beiping, and to all officers and soldiers: We have learned that Japanese soldiers at Lugouqiao, using the guise of military exercises, suddenly fired at our garrisoned infantry at Lugouqiao. The Japanese occupied nearby coal mines, surrounded Wanping, and deliberately provoked us. Their intentions are unpredictable. When the news came, both gods and men were outraged. We are filled with righteous indignation, awaiting orders in battle array, and have the will to serve the country and die for the nation. Generals, you are responsible for defending the territory and guarding the land. We urge you to uphold your unyielding spirit, deal with the ugly Japanese, and order your subordinates to be ready for battle, using force as a backup for seeking peace. We would rather fight a battle than lose an inch of land. Our union vows to lead postal workers across the country to await your command, and we will not hesitate to go through fire and water. The National Postal Workers' General Union and the postal workers' unions in various regions respectfully submit.

Workers' Movement Association

To General Song in Laoling, General Feng in Baoding, and all the officers and soldiers on the front line: The violent Japanese have trampled on our China for a long time, forcibly occupied our territory, destroyed our sovereignty, and slaughtered our people. The aggressive acts that violate international law are too numerous to count over the years. Our Central Government and the people of the whole country, determined to exist together, have spared no effort to seek perfection and maintain peace in the Far East, enduring humiliation until now. However, the Japanese side has not recognized this and has once again staged the Lugouqiao Incident. When the news spread, our eyes were torn. Generals, you have already established a glorious reputation for annihilating the enemy in the Great Wall Resistance in the past. Today, disaster is imminent, and you should complete the great task of saving the country. We hope that you will immediately mobilize to annihilate the Japanese invaders. All members of our association vow to be ready for battle and await orders. The Shanghai Workers' Movement Association respectfully submits.

China Labor Association

The China Labor Association sent a telegram to Song Zheyuan yesterday. To Chairman Song of the Beiping-Hebei-Chahar Political Committee: We were shocked to learn that the Japanese army has once again provoked and approached Lugouqiao. Our army fought bravely to resist the enemy and vowed to defend the land to the death. Their loyal hearts and heroic deeds illuminate the world. This association respectfully represents the labor circles across the country to express our condolences and sincere greetings. We also urge you to persevere to the end, not to lose an inch of land, to bring glory to our nation, and to extinguish the flames of the strong neighbors. This association vows to be your backing.

### Eurasia Aviation Corporation Plans to Restore the Lanzhou-Suzhou Line

The Eurasia Corporation opened the Shanghai-Xinjiang line in June of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. It originally flew directly from Shanghai to Dihua, Xinjiang, in an attempt to cross Russia to Berlin in Germany, completing the grand vision of air transportation between China and Europe. However, it was suddenly blocked in September of the same year due to international political obstacles in Xinjiang. Therefore, this line was hindered and could only fly to Lanzhou, Gansu. For many years, this has been the case. Since the company was threatened by the border situation, it had no choice but to change its course and engage in reorganizing domestic air routes (the most important example is the Pinggang Air Service), while quietly waiting for the improvement of the political situation in Xinjiang and planning to resume air service. It is now learned that the company has recently decided to first carry out a plan to restore the flight between Lanzhou and Suzhou, in order to prepare for the restoration of the entire Shanghai-Xinjiang air service. Recently, Holz, the director of the flight crew, went to inspect and has already gained some clues. Therefore, the Lanzhou-Suzhou line will be restored to air service in the short term.

### Vocational Students of the City's Student Training Corps Held Their Outbound Ceremony Yesterday

Commander Yang Relays Chairman Chiang's Speech, Acting Mayor Yu Discusses the Critical Moment of Survival

The outbound ceremony for vocational students of the City's Student Training Corps was held at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 11th) at the Zhongzheng Camp in West Shanghai. Participants included Commander Yang Xiaotian, the representative of the Chairman, Mayor Yu Hongjun, Police Chief Cai Jingjun, Hua Zhou and Wang Xiaolai of the Security Corps, Vice Commander Li Qiqi of the Corps, Corps Commander Luo Kelun, and more than 100 other people. After raising the flag, Commander Yang, the representative of the Chairman, led the military review ceremony. First, Chairman Li Xiangqi delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Commander Yang, the representative of the Chairman, and the awarding of graduation certificates, commemorative badges, and prizes. The ceremony was extremely grand. The speeches by Commander Yang, the representative of the Chairman, and others are recorded below.

Commander Yang's Speech

Today is the outbound ceremony for the vocational students of this corps. I am ordered by the Chairman to represent him in giving certificates and delivering a speech. I respectfully compile the Chairman's instructions to young students in recent years and read them on behalf of the Chairman. Young people are the masters of the country and should take it as their responsibility to save the world, save the country, and save the people. Young people should strengthen themselves, create human culture for the country and society. Young people should understand the responsibilities of the country and themselves, and create a country of the Three Principles of the People. Young people should understand society and develop a spirit of service. In the family, young people should be filial sons. In schools and organizations, young people should be responsible, loving, sincere, united, and unified. Young people should obey their leaders, strictly abide by discipline, and develop a spirit of collective living, decisiveness, courage, adventure, and progress. The goal of education is for the country and for the nation. If we study not to save the country and the nation, it is the same as not studying. Education is to cultivate the habits of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, to develop the habit of labor, and to promote the inherent moral culture and spirit of the nation. Although the training you have received here is short, it has a profound impact on your scholarship, self-cultivation, and life. This is the most valuable page in your life history, because this training has laid the foundation for our being human and for protecting the country. In the future, we must give full play to the spirit of training obtained from the training corps at any time and any place to fulfill our responsibilities to the country and society.

Mayor Yu's Speech

Today, I am very happy to participate in the outbound ceremony for the vocational students of this corps. At the same time, I am also extremely moved. Although the students of vocational schools only have a 40-day training period, under the hard work of all the officers, they have a considerable understanding of various basic military knowledge and have a considerable degree of spiritual cultivation. From now on, it will be easier for you to shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and saving the people. This is where I am happy. What moves me is that every time Hongjun comes to the corps headquarters, he sees our young classmates and thinks of the future hope of the country. Students, you must not forget that our country is in a period of turmoil and severe national crisis. Our responsibility is particularly important. Our country is at a critical juncture of survival. I hope that every young person will have the greatest determination. The greatest determination is to prepare for the greatest sacrifice. Students, you must know the words and deeds of the ancients in Chinese history, such as Yue Wu Mu's loyalty to the country, and Wen Tianxiang's words in prison, "Confucius said to achieve benevolence, Mencius said to take righteousness," which means that each of us should be loyal to the country and should take achieving benevolence and taking righteousness as our purpose. Now that we are in a period of severe national crisis, we want every young man and woman to have the greatest determination to sacrifice. We must look at the two words "life and death" very clearly. Life must have the meaning of life, and death must have the meaning of death, that is, death can be "as heavy as Mount Tai or as light as a feather." After our training, we can contribute our bodies to the country. This death is valuable and as heavy as Mount Tai. Otherwise, even if we are alive, we are not as good as a dead person. People who have no meaning in life are not needed by our country. Students, you all know that there is a law of survival of the fittest. The reason why human beings can survive to this day is because of human resistance. Human beings first competed with the natural world, and then fought with wild animals. Because the strength of human beings is higher than that of wild animals, human beings have won. Until now, this struggle for survival of the fittest has progressed to the mutual struggle between people. If our young people do not know how to resist and do not understand the principle that non-resistance cannot survive, then we will inevitably be eliminated under the law of survival of the fittest. Now we are in a period of severe national crisis, how can we save the country? I hope that our young classmates must remember the solemn oath we took in front of the Premier in the past. We must not only read it every day, but we must also put it into practice. Secondly, we must strengthen our bodies and cultivate our minds in order to prepare for the greatest sacrifice in case of danger. Finally, Cai Ju and Wang Xiaolai delivered speeches, encouraging us very much.

Sports and Dinner

The City's Student Training Corps held a sports meeting the day before yesterday (the 10th). Chairman Li Xiangqi and Commander Yang Xiaotian held the opening ceremony. The sports meeting started at 7:00 AM. Except for the high jump and long jump, which were the same as the ordinary rules, most of the rest were armed competitions. The results were extremely excellent. The most tense events for the audience were the 3,000-meter armed cross-country race, the 5,000-meter bicycle cross-country race, and the tug-of-war competition, which were extremely exciting. It was not completed until 5:00 PM. Chairman Wu Tiecheng and Mayor Yu Hongjun both rushed to participate in the closing ceremony before 5:00 PM and watched the tug-of-war competition. It is said that about 300 athletes participated in the sports meeting. The prizes donated by various agencies and schools in Beijing and Shanghai were displayed on the rostrum, a dazzling array of beauty. The quantity was particularly high, setting a new record for the training sports meeting of all sessions. At 6:00 PM that day, a dinner party was held in the exercise field of the Zhongzheng Camp for the same joy. Participants included Chairman Wu Tiecheng, Mayor Yu Hongjun, Police Chief Cai Jingjun, Vice Commander Li Xiangqi of the Corps, Corps Commander Luo Kelun, and more than 8,000 officers and students. During the dinner, the guests, officials, and students enjoyed themselves very much. At the beginning of the dinner, Vice Commander Li reported on the meaning of the dinner party and detailed Chairman Wu's enthusiasm for leading national military training during his tenure as mayor and the fact that he resolutely allocated huge funds to build the Zhongzheng Camp when the city treasury was in deficit, laying the foundation for military training in the city. Finally, Chairman Wu gave a speech, roughly to encourage all the students to support the leader and revive the nation, and to explain the meaning of the naming of the Zhongzheng Camp. When Mr. Wu gave his speech, his words were passionate and his tone was loud, and the audience was excited by it. It was not until 8:00 PM that everyone dispersed happily. The prizes received from all parties at the sports meeting were awarded at the same time during yesterday's outbound ceremony.

Chairman's Report

Pan Bingchen, Wang He'an, and Wen Zhenwei were publicly elected as the presidium, with Chen Zhonghua as the recorder. Pan Bingchen first reported, saying, "Gentlemen, our guild is holding this oath-taking ceremony today to reject counterfeit Manchukuo currency and not to trade in smuggled goods. The significance of this oath and the relationship between counterfeit Manchukuo currency, smuggled goods, and our national economy and people's livelihood were thoroughly explained by me at the previous members' meeting. I believe all of you who attended have heard it, and those who did not attend have likely seen it in the newspapers. There's no need to waste time repeating it. Today, gentlemen, you have come to this meeting to take the oath on such a hot day. This is truly an excellent phenomenon in China. I hope all of you who attend will faithfully act according to the oath. First, you must never be blinded by profit and forget righteousness, bringing shame to our guild and causing your own downfall and disgrace. Second, you must persevere consistently and never slacken at any time. This is what our guild most earnestly hopes for. Today, we are also honored to have representatives from all sectors come to the meeting for guidance. Our guild is extremely grateful and requests much advice."

Speeches from Higher Authorities

Following this, (1) He Yuanming, representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, stating, "Your guild's oath today to reject counterfeit Manchukuo currency and not to trade in smuggled goods is something I am very fortunate to participate in, having been delegated to attend. The relationship between counterfeit Manchukuo currency and smuggled goods is something all of you understand and are aware of. There is no need for me to say much. I hope you will maintain this enthusiasm and persevere consistently." (2) Cao Zhigong, representative from the Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee, delivered a speech, stating, "Your guild's holding of this oath-taking ceremony today is of great significance. The relationship between counterfeit Manchukuo currency and smuggled goods is something I also need not say much about. The Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee originally wanted to ask various guilds to hold oaths, but your guild is enthusiastic and able to advocate and implement this before other guilds. It is truly admirable." (3) Yuan Hongjun, representative from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech, stating, "Your guild's first holding of the oath-taking ceremony to reject counterfeit Manchukuo currency and not to trade in smuggled goods is greatly admirable. I hope that after taking the oath, members of each Zhuang will follow through to the end."

Oath Taking by All

Under the leadership of the presidium, the managers of the 51 member Qian Zhuang families all took the following oath: "We hereby swear with utmost sincerity not to accept or give counterfeit Manchukuo currency and not to trade in smuggled goods in order to fulfill our duties as citizens. If we violate this oath, we are willing to accept the most severe public censure without any objection. We solemnly swear." The managers of each Zhuang also stamped their seals on the oath form to show their solemn commitment. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.

Counterfeit Currency Styles

Yesterday, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Money Exchange Guild that "counterfeit Manchukuo" currency is divided into denominations of 50 cents, one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. The style is as follows: The front features the Central Bank of Manchuria, with the Manchurian flag on the left and a picture of the bank on the right, and the seal of the president is stamped. The reverse side states: "This note is issued in accordance with the Currency Law of the Government of Manchuria, implemented on June 11, the first year of Datong. Summary of the Currency Law, Article 1: The right to manufacture and issue currency belongs to the government and is exercised by the Central Bank of Manchuria. Article 2: The unit of price is named the 'Yuan,' with a pure silver weight of 23.91 grams." (Image of counterfeit Manchukuo currency omitted.)

The Delegation's Advisor Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday; Original Plan to Arrive in Shanghai via North China Abandoned

The economic delegation from the Dutch East Indies government, after arriving in Shanghai and then proceeding to Japan, is currently still staying in Japan, continuing to discuss trade issues between Japan and the Netherlands.

General Assembly Declaration

Declaration of the Establishment of the Constitutional Advancement Association: The conditions that a modern country must possess are complete territory, independent sovereignty, and a sound national organization. Because we lack a good organization, we have been subjected to countless foreign invasions, contempt, and insults. Why do we lack a good organization? It is only because until recently, China had not yet embarked on the path of constitutional government. But constitutional government is by no means something that can be obtained without effort. Many modern countries have gone through long periods of revolution, bloodshed, and turmoil before embarking on the path of constitutional government. The Chinese people's demand for constitutional government has also gone through a long struggle of forty years. The Xinhai Revolution was to demand constitutional government, the Second Revolution was to demand constitutional government, and the Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang after sixteen years to overthrow the rule of warlords was also only to realize constitutional government. The modern constitutional movement has finally reached the day of victory. Our domestic peace and unification have been achieved, and the national rejuvenation is beginning. After the period of military and political tutelage predetermined by the Chinese Kuomintang, the constitutional period is about to arrive. The National Government has decided to convene the National Assembly on November 11, 26, to formulate a constitution and return power to the people. In this way, a new year in the history of the Republic of China will immediately begin. This future constitutional period will arrive along with the bright and happy future of the Republic of China. From then on, we will forever cleanse the national humiliation of "disorganization." Our country will be transformed into a brand new, youthful, and modern country. These are by no means empty words. We can expect at least the following things from this constitutional period: First, the people of the Republic of China will raise their heads and make China a truly democratic, of the people, by the people, and for the people republic. Second, the rights of freedom that the people of a modern country should enjoy, the Chinese people should all enjoy equally. In particular, freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association, these minimum freedoms should be considered sacred and inviolable. Third, the relationship between the government and the people, and the relationship between the central government and the local governments, will be permanently established on the basis of the rule of law. The whole country will be truly united, and internal friction and conflict will be avoided forever. In short, China in the constitutional period will become a democratic, free, united, and harmonious China. After we establish democracy, freedom, unity, and harmony, we will have a solid guarantee of victory in our external resistance to aggression. But to achieve these goals, the work is not very easy. We have already paid a great price to win the constitutional government. After we have won it, we must make the greatest effort to guarantee and promote the realization of the constitutional government. At present, our efforts should be in the following areas: First, the constitution is the foundation of the constitutional government, and the constitutional government should be participated in by all the people. Therefore, the constitution must also be created by an organ that truly represents the will of the people. Therefore, we must strive to make the National Assembly a constitutional organ that truly represents the will of the people. From this National Assembly, we must also strive to create a democratic constitution that is most suitable for China's national conditions and modern needs. Second, the formulation and promulgation of the constitution is only the beginning of constitutional government. After the constitutional government begins, it must be able to guarantee the full implementation of the constitution. The government should avoid all laws and actions that conflict with the constitution. The people should regard the constitution as sacred and inviolable. The whole country, from top to bottom, must unanimously and sincerely support and abide by the new constitution. It is not easy for our country, which lacks constitutional elements, to achieve this step. This requires a long period of training, supervision, publicity, and education before it can be achieved. Third, the constitution itself, and the operation of the political structure after the establishment of the constitution, are extremely complex and very important. This requires close attention from most people and in-depth research by scholars and experts to be able to consider and improve, so that constitutional government can develop and grow under healthy conditions. The Constitutional Advancement Association is a popular organization including various parties and non-party people with the above work as its purpose, and this organization welcomes all enthusiastic patriots, law-abiding Chinese people to participate. We are now in a period of external resistance to aggression and internal construction. In this period, we need national defense construction and economic construction, but especially we need a strong and good national organization as the foundation of all construction. We believe that assisting the government and promoting constitutional government should be the most fundamental and most important work at present. Fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters of the whole country, let us all participate in this important construction work, and let us all work together to build a new China of democracy, freedom, unity, and harmony. Long live the Republic of China!

Those who have not yet decided on the list should recommend it immediately and notify the association immediately.

General Assembly Declaration

The General Assembly issued a declaration stating, "In recent years, the Shanghai Concession authorities have wantonly destroyed the Chinese New Culture Movement, and it has reached its limit. The Shanghai cultural circles, because they did not want to cause serious disputes, have exercised extreme patience and made concessions everywhere, hoping that the situation would improve and that the Concession authorities would gradually realize their mistakes and injustice. But the result of many years of patience has not only failed to make them realize their mistakes, but has instead fueled the flames of oppression. The facts of recent years can clearly prove that the Concession authorities have consistently used colonial policies to suppress cultural workers with forward-thinking and awakening consciousness, while at the same time allowing the cultural aggression of warmongers to be rampant. Films with maps of the four northeastern provinces must be censored before they can be shown. Dramas with the line 'The Northeast is ours' are banned from being performed. Even slogans such as 'Do not buy or sell smuggled goods' are not allowed to be shown. But films like 'New Land' are openly shown under the protection of public concession police. What is placed before our eyes is an ironclad fact, a fact that the Concession authorities are oppressing us, a fact that the Concession authorities are favoring the aggressors. We have now reached a point where there is no retreat, but the oppression is becoming more and more fierce. Recently, the Concession authorities have deliberately nitpicked the censorship of drama and songs, and at the same time, they have newly formulated even more harsh censorship procedures. If we do not unite and resist now and abolish their censorship rights, then in the near future, there will be no culture to speak of in the Shanghai Concessions, except for anesthetizing culture and culture that promotes imperialism. In order to fight for freedom for the entire cultural circle and to save it from destruction, we have now united various cultural groups in Shanghai to organize and implement our proposal to abolish the censorship rights of the Concessions. The censorship currently implemented by the Concession authorities is completely unreasonable and absolutely unfair. Our struggle this time is to fight for the survival and freedom of the entire Chinese cultural circle. We hope that the Central Government will immediately negotiate seriously with the Concession authorities to abolish this illegal organ in the Concessions that infringes upon China's sovereign rights. We are willing to use the power of the entire cultural circle as the government's support. We want to expand the movement and unite with all sectors of society to fight against the Concession authorities until we achieve our goal. At the same time, we must also convey our voice to the cultural circles of the world to expose the fact that the Concession authorities are oppressing the Chinese cultural movement and shielding Japanese imperialists. We will not hesitate to use the greatest determination and sacrifice to implement our proposal. We ask the national people and all those in the world who sympathize with us to stand with us on the same front and fight. With an indomitable spirit, we will surely achieve final victory!"

Telegram to Encourage Soldiers

The association also sent a telegram stating, "To the Headquarters of the 29th Army in Beiping and to all officers and soldiers at the front lines, The Japanese army is using pretexts to provoke, and the people of the whole country are extremely indignant. All of you are bravely defending the country, and the whole world is in admiration. We urge you to persevere to the end. The members of this association vow to be your backup. Founding Meeting of the Shanghai Cultural Circles Movement to Abolish the Film and Drama Censorship Rights of the Concessions."

### Private Smuggling of Opium Discovered Inside Bamboo Basket

Weight: 53 Ounces

Wei Hehan, a native of Hubei residing at 214 Yanshan Road, was found carrying a bamboo basket containing 50 small packets of opium, weighing 53 ounces in total. This occurred near Yangshupu Lan Road at 9:35 PM the day before yesterday. A Chinese constable, badge number 3376, found his behavior suspicious and stopped him. When asked about the contents, Wei claimed it was clothing. However, the pungent odor of opium was unmistakable. Upon inspection, the basket was found to contain raw opium. Wei was immediately taken to the Yulin Road Police Station and detained. Yesterday, he was handed over to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police attorney Li Zhishan has filed a public prosecution against him on the charge of transporting opium. Constable 3376 submitted a report detailing the arrest, presented the evidence for inspection, and questioned Wei. Wei confessed that he was crossing the river from Pudong on a sampan when a man named Qiu, from his hometown, asked him to carry the bamboo basket to a certain location. Qiu works at the Xinmeihe Wharf in Pudong and was following behind him but fled when Wei was arrested.

### Young Woman Injured After Jumping from Window to Escape Forced Marriage

Wei Wenjian Accused of Depriving Freedom; Imprisoned Li Huailin's Sister at a Friend's House

Li Huailin, a 38-year-old teacher from Wujiang residing at No. 4 Fudeli, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, has a younger sister, Li Ruizhu, 23, who is quite attractive. Wei Wenjian, a 27-year-old bookseller (also from Wujiang), living at No. 1 Fengyuli, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei, has been in love with Ruizhu and proposed marriage. However, Ruizhu and her mother opposed the marriage, and she became engaged to a man named Gao. After being rejected, Wei Wenjian lured Ruizhu to a friend's house and confined her for two days and three nights, coercing her to agree to the marriage. In desperation, Ruizhu jumped from the window and was injured. Li Huailin filed a lawsuit in the local court against Wei for deprivation of freedom. Yesterday, Judge Weng held a hearing. Wei Wenjian testified that in March of last year in Chongming, Li Ruizhu expressed her intention to marry him, and her mother and others agreed. Later, she became engaged to someone else. On the 14th of last month, he met her at the Daxin Amusement Park and invited her to ride in a car with him to his friend Cai Shunzhang's place on Fangxie Road. He pleaded with her due to considerations of face, and she agreed to the marriage. They stayed at Cai's house for two days but did not sleep together. After two days, she somehow escaped, and he chased her to a relative's house. Seeing that she was injured, he sent her to the hospital for treatment, but he did not force her, etc. Li Huailin testified that Li Ruizhu is his younger sister, 23 years old. Wei Wenjian proposed to her in Chongming, but because of the large age difference, their mother was unwilling, and his sister did not agree. Later, she became engaged to Gao. On the 14th of last month, his sister was accompanying relatives at the Daxin Amusement Park when Wei used forceful means to take her to his friend's house, confining her for two days and three nights, demanding marriage. In desperation, his sister escaped from the window, resulting in serious injuries. She was sent to Qu Zhibu Hospital, but due to lack of funds, she was discharged. She has not recovered. If he can bear the medical expenses, he does not wish to pursue the matter further, etc. The judge said that money is one thing, and the law is another. He declared the debate concluded and scheduled the verdict for the 14th.

### Appeal Debate Concluded in Bai Yushuang's Breach of Contract Case

Verdict Scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 15th

Bai Yushuang, the "Queen of Pingju Opera" and Bengbeng Opera actress, also known as Li Guizhen, has been very popular since arriving in Shanghai, where her performances have been risqué. Her career has been extremely successful. Therefore, the Empire Theater entered into a long-term contract with her, which proved to be quite profitable. However, at the end of last year, due to a change in personal circumstances, she had a disagreement with her adoptive mother, Li Bian, and left without saying goodbye, disappearing without a trace. It has now been half a year, and her whereabouts are unknown. Zhang Juchuan, manager of the Tongyi Company, which owns the Empire Theater, believed that Bai Yushuang's contract had not yet expired. During the Lunar New Year period, the theater suffered considerable losses. Therefore, Zhang Juchuan, through Tongyi Company, commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Bai Yushuang's family and Xu Peigen, director of the Pingju troupe, demanding compensation of 5,000 yuan for breach of contract and over 10,000 yuan for the business losses during the unfulfilled contract period. After the initial trial, the plaintiff's claim was rejected. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Because the Empire side was dissatisfied with the judgment, they appealed to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. After investigation, the Third Civil Division of the High Court, led by Judge Xia Quande, accompanied by judges Tong and Fan, came to the Third Court the day before yesterday morning to hold a joint hearing. Lawyers for both sides were present. The appellant requested the reversal of the original judgment and an order for the appellees to compensate the losses in full. The appellees argued that the original judgment was appropriate and requested that the original judgment be upheld and the appeal be dismissed. The court, believing that the case was clear, ordered the debate to be closed and announced that the verdict would be announced at 9:00 AM on the 15th.

When this failed, he beat Zhou severely. Zhou ran to the Sanjiaodi Police Station to report the incident, but the police could not find Shi. Zhou went home, but after walking only a few steps, Shi suddenly chased him and slapped him in the face. Shi was about to search Zhou's body for money and goods when Yang Chuanxin, who lived nearby, saw what was happening and shouted for him to stop. Shi turned his anger on Yang and began to beat him.

### Gao Zengfu Sued for Adultery with a Married Woman

Court Announces Trial Concluded; Verdict on the 16th

Ding Songren, a native of Qingpu, currently residing at No. 13 Jingye Lane, Hengfeng Road, has a wife, Lu Fuqing, who is 24 years old this year. She originally lived in their hometown, while Ding was a merchant in Shanghai and did not often return home.

She met Gao Zengfu, a 37-year-old native of Anhui, and they quickly became intimate. They rented a small house on Dapu Road in the Nanshi District and lived together like a married couple for three years. Ding Songren searched tirelessly for his wife, hoping to find her again. Recently, Lu happened to meet Ding while buying groceries. He followed her and arrested her and Gao Zengfu, handing them over to the local court for investigation. Gao Zengfu claimed that he did not know that Lu was married and that Lu had even written a voluntary statement in the 24th year of the Republic of China as proof. Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang found that Lu was not yet 20 years old at the time, so Gao Zengfu should be charged with abduction and seduction, and Lu Fuqing should be charged with adultery. Yesterday, Judge Cai questioned the parties. The plaintiff's lawyer, Yan Sun, filed a private prosecution for 676 yuan. The defendants' statements were the same as those given to the prosecutor's office. The court announced that the trial was concluded and that the verdict would be announced on the 16th.

Han, a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and the entire Shaanxi Provincial Commercial Inspection Team, led by Li Zhigang from the Shaanxi Provincial Office in Beijing, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to visit the various pharmaceutical production rooms of the Sino-French Pharmaceutical Factory on Daxilu Road. They were very interested in the rapid and accurate output of various new pharmaceutical machines. They particularly praised the small Rendan grinding machine designed by the pharmaceutical factory and praised the excellent quality of the Longchuren Rendan, which they said was superior to any other summer heat medicine.

### Kangfuduo Sales Increase Sharply

Zhengde Pharmaceutical Factory in this port is the most advanced pharmaceutical factory in modern times. Kangfuduo preparations produced by the factory have long been sold at home and abroad, and are delicious health products, cough remedies, and phlegm medicine. Because its main ingredients are fish oil essence and other precious nourishing ingredients, it is especially effective for physical impairment, neurasthenia, lung disease, cough, etc. Furthermore, after the famous medical experiment, the results show that Kangfuduo successfully and safely quit smoking, and has the satisfying effect of restoring health. Since the famous medical experiment announced its effectiveness last year, more than 100,000 people have been addicted to smoking in various places through this method to quit smoking. Therefore, the sales of Kangfuduo in various places are very prosperous. Recently, the government has been stricter in implementing the prohibition policy, and everyone is competing to quit smoking on their own, so the sales of Kangfuduo have increased sharply in recent days. It is reported that the pharmaceutical factory is greatly expanding to meet the needs of society.

Talking Points

### National Salvation and Freedom of Drama

— Nai Yi

The sound of gunfire in Wanping rings again. The rights and wrongs of this time, and who is responsible, have been clearly told to us on the telegram, and there is no need to say more. The enemy has been deliberately pressing in North China for so long, can't we detect it at all? Now, it's just that the enemy thinks the opportunity is ripe, and adds fuel to the fire.

In this situation, since we failed to prevent problems before they happened, drive the enemy out of the country, and stop the enemy's aggression, if we are flustered and indecisive today when the crisis comes, and cannot deal with it properly, what will be the result? The previous examples are all before our eyes. Please feel free to look at that incident.

Now, we can only concentrate all our efforts to unite for national salvation, so that we can overcome the current danger, so that the Chinese nation will live forever!

Under the principle of concentrating strength and under the premise of consistent national salvation, the methods of our national salvation work should be multi-faceted.

This quickly makes people think of the "Shanghai Cultural Circles Abolish and Boundary Film and Drama Inspection Movement" that opened its founding meeting yesterday, and the several young people who were arrested in the Bund Park a few days ago for singing national salvation songs.

The obstacles to national salvation work in the concessions are truly endless. Political and other people's organizations do not need to be mentioned. In terms of films and dramas, we don't know how many times we have experienced and how many times we have produced evidence. Under such accumulation, the rise of the movement to abolish film and drama inspection is inevitable, and there is no need to say more about this. What is noteworthy is the reaction caused by this movement, such as being arrested for singing national salvation songs, etc. Mr. Shen Jiaqian also said this yesterday.

Film and drama themselves are education, and the educational power of national salvation drama. From the repeated obstructions by the concessions, a counter-proof can be obtained: At this time, the sound of gunfire in Wanping rings again, and the nationwide war of resistance against the enemy is about to start. How should we promote and develop this "carving insect skills" that has always been regarded by gentlemen as relieving sorrow and boredom?

On the one hand, we are launching a movement to abolish inspections; Regarding this movement, I believe that we only have the limitations of different goals, and should not have the limitations of the qualifications of participants. Because our purpose is to abolish the illegal inspection rights of the concessions, and not to test whether the participating groups have registered with the Social Bureau. On the other hand, that is to say, outside the concessions, before the illegal inspection rights of the concessions are abolished, we should widely and deeply use various forms to promote national salvation propaganda. We should not only actively perform national salvation dramas, but we should also integrate this kind of national salvation drama into the countryside and factories. Because of this, we are extremely moved by the recent announcement by the municipal government to decisively cancel the celebration program, and in addition to being moved, we can't help but regret that the canceled program happens to be a national salvation drama, because at present, the performance of national salvation drama is not for entertainment, but for education.

Therefore, in addition to hoping that there will be large-scale and widespread performances of national salvation dramas outside the concessions, we feel that the responsibility for the abolition of the inspection rights of the boundary is even greater and more urgent!

### Laborers

— Zhi Fu

That pockmarked young man, quite stout, Wang Dakouzi, the recruitment committee member whose speech always carried a bit of a nasal tone, bowed his head and pondered for quite some time. Then, he hurried back and leaned close to the rickshaw puller A'Shuai's ear, whispering secretively to him again.

The air in the room was still so solemn and tense that you could almost hear the clear buzzing of a bluebottle fly passing by. A'Shuai—his face completely serious now, paying attention to the recruitment list in Dakouzi's hand—felt his heart itching even more. So, this time, he nodded his head uncontrollably and unhesitatingly accepted the symbol given to him by the committee member.

The symbol had several delicate and eye-catching Chinese characters written on it, "The Committee for Mining Production of ×× Country is Recruiting Laborers…" even A'Shuai's own name was written below. He felt another surge of happiness in his heart, raised his hand, and waved the symbol high in front of his chest, mysteriously, and then hid it again in his waistband, with a smiling face.

He saw that Committee Member Wang was very busy talking to others. Only when the time to leave was near did he boldly step forward and say decisively to this Committee Member Wang:

"Well then, I will now act according to your instructions. I will return the rickshaw in the afternoon and come back here to see you; but—don't change your mind… I have three family members, big and small,… making a living is not a joke!"

A'Shuai dragged the rickshaw, dragged it, and stopped the vehicle cheerfully at the entrance of a rickshaw shop. —

However, when he saw Boss Zhao, he deliberately put on a face of sorrow and sadness:

"Boss Zhao! You know that I have four family members to feed, and it's really impossible to survive by pulling this rickshaw every day… Moreover, the day before yesterday, my old mother in the Shandong countryside sent a letter saying that she is old and can no longer work… Therefore, I plan to return to my hometown the day after tomorrow and cultivate a few old fields myself… to avoid… wandering outside all my life…"

"Hmm… hmm…!" Boss Zhao considered for a moment and then spat out two words from his nostrils in response. Immediately afterward, his face turned red and he said, "I know, you say you can survive, but you can't; actually…! You're going to work for the ×× people, aren't you?"

"Who said that? —My God!"

A'Shuai expressed his surprise with great distress.

"What God is there! —You can deceive others, but you can't deceive me, A'Shuai." The rickshaw shop owner pursed his uneven lips and said, "It's up to you whether you do the business or not, but I have to warn you: Wang Dakouzi and the others are not good people!…"

"…" Although these big words still made A'Shuai a little suspicious, he couldn't come up with any words to deny it for a moment. So, he was stunned in confusion.

However, Boss Zhao understood his intention even more clearly.

A'Shuai! I tell you, earning the money of the ×× people is not easy! You have the courage to try, so naturally I have nothing to say, but in the future… in the future, don't come back to me to ask me to rent out the rickshaw again (that is, the meaning of renting a rickshaw). He paused, "Moreover, I'm afraid that once you go, you won't be able to return here… Haven't you seen the floating corpses all over the river these days?"

A'Shuai's heart was pierced like a knife. After a long while, he went over and pleaded:

"Boss! I don't want to get rich, I really want to go back to my hometown!"

"Okay, go!" The boss said this and didn't try to dissuade him anymore: "Then you can return the rickshaw license to me! Hmm, hmm!…"

Arriving home. A'Shuai didn't say a word, didn't even go to Wang Dakouzi's place to stroll around, and went straight to sleep on the broken bed.

But in the middle of the night, A'Shuai had a terrible nightmare. He dreamed of a vast expanse of water, just like the familiar sea route. He was hanging the symbol that Committee Member Wang had given him and looking out at the sea when suddenly, he was surrounded by people who threw his body into the heart of the sea; he shouted, shouting with all his might…

Waking up, he felt a palpitation in his heart, and his body felt strangely empty. He looked alone at the dark corner, recalled the dream, and became confused again,…
