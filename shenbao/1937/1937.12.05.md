### The Japanese Army's Attempt to Invade Nanjing Suffers a Major Blow from Our Forces

The Plan to Invade Lishui Also Stalls, Danyang Front Moves North, Jurong Under Strain, Our Forces Approach Changxing, Fierce Fighting Ensues

[Hankou] According to news received here this morning from the Chinese side, the Japanese army's attempt to invade Nanjing has suffered a blow from the Chinese forces. The Japanese army has been contained at Lücheng, ten miles north of Changzhou, and the Japanese army's plan to invade Lishui from Liyang has also stalled. This is due not only to the resistance of the frontal troops but also to the progress of the Chinese army's advance towards Changxing on the southern shore of Taihu Lake. The fighting near Guangde has been fierce in recent days, with heavy losses on both sides, according to the (Third National Maritime Telegram). Yesterday, according to foreign sources in Nanjing, the Japanese army, since the evening of the third, equipped with strong forces, with Zhenjiang, Jurong, and Lishui as its three strongholds, divided its forces into several routes and launched attacks simultaneously. Our military authorities consider the above-mentioned three strongholds to be the defensive outposts of Nanjing and militarily strategic locations. In addition to gathering elite heavy troops in a twenty-kilometer zone around Nanjing for strict defense, they also strictly ordered the troops in Zhenjiang, Jurong, and Lishui to coexist with the positions and not to retreat a single step without orders. Therefore, since yesterday morning, fierce fighting has unfolded in the area north of Danyang to the south towards Liyang and Lishui, especially along the highway west of Liyang. Furthermore, our army, advancing along the Guangde-Sian highway to counterattack Changxing, aims to cut off the Japanese army's rear. Currently, our army's progress is quite smooth, and the situation is very favorable. It is expected that an unprecedented bloody battle will unfold within a day or two.

The Japanese army attacking Lishui from Liyang is still confronting our army between Heqiao and Zhangzhu. It is reported that Xushe is still in our hands. The Japanese army on that route, due to our army's counterattack on the southern shore of Taihu Lake approaching Changxing, has significant concerns and constraints. It is also learned that the Japanese army in Wuxing, Shimen, Puyuan, and other places has indeed been affected by our army's guerrilla warfare and is retreating towards the Tongxiang area. The situation for our army on that line has therefore improved.

There is still fierce fighting near Danyang, with constant artillery fire for the past two days. The intensity of the fighting between the two sides is unprecedented. Our army has also strengthened fortifications between Xinfeng and Malingzhen, relying on high ground to defend, with substantial strength, which has inflicted a major setback on the advancing Japanese army. The Japanese army advancing west to attack Jurong has also encountered great resistance from our army east of Baituzhen and fierce battles have occurred. There have been no reports of any progress on either side. However, it seems to be a fact that the Japanese army on that route is facing supply difficulties.

The Domei News Agency reports that the Chinese army near Nanjing has begun vigorous movements towards the south since the third. Also, a large unit of the Chinese army in Wuhu is crossing the Yangtze River to the north bank. The Japanese military authorities are paying close attention to this move by the Chinese army.

The Domei News Agency reports that the Japanese army advancing from Liyang towards Nanjing has crossed Mopan Mountain and reached Shangxingbu on the third. Afterwards, they encountered repeated attacks from the Chinese army. However, they occupied Changshan on the morning of the fourth, and their vanguard continued to advance. At 11:00 AM yesterday, they began to attack Baimaqiao Town, which is about twelve kilometers from Lishui. The Domei News Agency reports that the Japanese army advancing westward from Danyang passed through Baituzhen on the evening of the third and captured places such as Xingxiang Daping Village on the morning of the fourth. Near noon, they approached Wangjiabian, the forward guard position of Jurong, which is only three kilometers from Jurong.

### The Principles of Peace Talks Allegedly Proposed During the German Envoy's Mediation

A Semi-Autonomous Zone to be Established in North China, A Japanese Concession to be Opened in Shanghai, The German Ambassador Only Made Suggestions to Chairman Chiang

[Hankou] According to official sources here today, although the German Ambassador to China, Trautmann, has been tasked by Berlin with mediating the Sino-Japanese War, Trautmann has only made suggestions to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and has not put forward any peace proposals. According to information obtained by official sources here, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that China had no intention of going to war with Japan, but once war breaks out, it is impossible not to resist to the end. China's resistance power is far from being exhausted, and it is not possible to talk about ending the war at this time. It is also rumored that Wang Jingwei and others believe that it may be worthwhile to try to talk with the German Ambassador regarding his mediation. However, the opinions of patriotic groups and the public in general, as well as representatives from the Soviet Union, are all urging Chiang to resist to the end and reject mediation. According to sources at the German Embassy, the following are some of the known principles of peace talks proposed by Japan: ㊀ A semi-autonomous organization will be established in North China, employing Japanese advisors; ㊁ A Japanese concession will be opened in Shanghai; ㊂ Chinese tariffs will be revised. (Fourth National Telegram)

[Tokyo] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today formally denied the report in the New York Min Sheng Bao that Japan intends to grant Shandong's rights to Germany in exchange for Japan's permanent enjoyment of the Pacific mandated islands, and dismissed the talk of German Ambassador to China Trautmann mediating the Sino-Japanese War as propaganda. (Fourth National Telegram)

[Hong Kong] Hankou, Fourth Telegram: German Ambassador Trautmann went to Nanjing on the second for official business and returned to Hankou by ship in the evening. He is expected to arrive in port on the morning of the fifth. (Fourth Special Telegram)

[London] Diplomatic circles recently confirmed that the German Ambassador to China, Trautmann, is prepared to act as a mediator for the conflict between China and Japan. However, it is generally believed that the German Ambassador will only suggest direct negotiations between China and Japan. General observers believe that China may not accept direct negotiations, as China is well aware of the true meaning of direct negotiations. Although the conditions proposed by Japan have not yet been revealed, it can be asserted that their demands will be very harsh. (Fourth Havas Telegram)

[Beiping] Today, a certain newspaper run by the Japanese here strongly urges the Chinese and foreign people to advocate peace with Japan, saying that everyone today should make this urgent appeal to the Chinese government. Anyone who submits a telegram advocating peace can be assured that it will reach its destination. (Fourth Reuters Telegram)

[Tokyo] A semi-official Japanese organization here claims that if Chinese leaders use Hong Kong as a base for the anti-Japanese movement, it is feared that new problems will arise. (Fourth Reuters Telegram)

[London] Diplomatic and business circles all believe that the news of Hitler's mediation of the war in the Far East is "inevitably inaccurate, but there must be a reason." This matter has attracted attention everywhere. Reuters reporters today interviewed several diplomats who believe that Hitler would be very happy to increase the prestige of the Fascist countries by restoring peace, and said that Herr Hitler is in a particularly convenient position to mediate. However, Germany has economic interests in China and political relations with Japan, so it is also very difficult to begin. The Daily People's Voice said that Hitler is afraid that Japan will weaken its military strength due to prolonged war, and on the other hand, he is afraid that China will be forced to depend on the Soviet Union. Many parties now believe that Japan certainly wants Britain to come forward to mediate, but there is also reason to believe that the Japanese government does not share the same views as pro-British newspapers. Now all parties believe that Japan is very happy to discuss peace talks, because the expenditure on military expenses far exceeds its expected number. The Chinese people's mood to continue to resist the war is visibly stronger in the past two weeks. Before the fall of Nanjing, China will not pay attention to the talk of peace, and everyone believes that after the fall of Nanjing, China has an excellent opportunity to obtain good conditions. The Daily Post said that the whole world hopes that China and Japan will initiate peace talks directly as soon as possible. Extending the war by one day will only increase the sacrifice of both people and property. Although China has won great sympathy everywhere, it is difficult to expect to obtain anything more substantial after the termination of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. China's resistance is certainly brave, but it will ultimately not obtain any benefits. (Fourth Reuters Telegram)

### Wu Dingchang Gives a Speech in Hankou

[Hankou] Wu Dingchang, Chairman of Guizhou Province and former Minister of Industry, met with representatives of the Haitong News Agency this morning and elaborated on China's position. Wu declared that China will certainly not be defeated. From the perspective of financial situation, China has more than enough to engage in a thirteen-year long-term war. China is an agricultural country, and it is already self-sufficient in terms of food. Especially since the establishment of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, the fear of food shortage is even more unnecessary. The textile industry is currently being reorganized, and the problem of clothing can also be solved. What China needs to rely on from abroad is only military supplies, because China's military industry has not yet developed. However, China has 4,500,000,000 yuan deposited in foreign banks, which is more than enough to pay for the purchase of military supplies within two years. As for all domestic expenses, foreign debts can be raised separately. Therefore, China is determined to fight on until it achieves final victory or Japan changes its course and puts forward acceptable conditions for peace talks. It is only under such circumstances that Nanjing will be willing to negotiate with Tokyo. Regarding the failure of the Brussels Conference, Wu expressed deep regret and believed that all foreign aid is not reliable. When asked by the interviewer whether he would accept the mediation of a third country, Wu declared that China would not refuse if Japan's conditions were acceptable for consideration. In short, the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty must be guaranteed, and the equality of China's economic status must be respected. Regarding Germany's attitude towards the conflict in the Far East, Wu declared that China is pleased with Germany's strict neutrality and believes that this is an important contribution to promoting friendship between the two countries. He hopes that in the near future, the two countries can have mutually beneficial cooperation opportunities again. (Fourth National Telegram)

### Chairman of the Central Political Council Wang Jingwei Delivers a Speech in Hankou

China is Maintaining the Spirit of Struggle Without Declining, Every Citizen Should Fulfill Their Responsibility to the Country

[Hankou] Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Council, said in a speech in Hankou today, "China's front and rear are now maintaining their spirit of struggle without declining, until the very last moment. Therefore, the powers that sympathize with China now have the opportunity to participate in China's resistance to Japanese aggression. China must face this national crisis with great determination, and must not lose its spirit because of Japan's temporary victory." Wang also cited the ancient Chinese proverb "Know yourself and know your enemy" as the secret to China's perseverance and victory. China knows its weaknesses, so it feels the need to make double efforts and resist to the end with a steadfast determination. Long-term resistance depends on the soldiers at the front, and even more on the people in the rear. If the people in the rear are weak and unorganized, there can be no strong combat power. Therefore, the motto of China's struggle at present is that every citizen should fulfill their responsibility to the country by contributing money or labor. Since the issuance of the 500 million national salvation bonds, which are tied to the future of China's resistance, some weaknesses have been exposed. This bond amount is only one-fifth of what Japan can obtain in one stroke. If China cannot raise even this bond amount, how can it be said that it can resist to the end? As for the people's enthusiastic enlistment in the army, it is also an unshirkable responsibility. China has 400 million people and should be able to recruit more than 2 million soldiers. Japan, with its 70 million people, can still recruit 4 million soldiers. Why can't China do the same? In the last paragraph of Wang's speech, he strongly emphasized the importance of the entire nation and the entire people having the determination to support the current struggle with all their strength, until the very last moment.

### British Embassy Staff Depart Hankou for Shanghai

[Hankou] The British Embassy began moving from Hankou to Shanghai yesterday. The British Chargé d'Affaires, Herbert, and a group of embassy staff have departed for Hong Kong, leaving only Second Secretary Gage stationed in Hankou to liaise with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs at any time. Herbert and his party are traveling to Hong Kong via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. There are six men and five women. All kinds of preparations were made before the train departed to ensure safety. The British flag was painted on the top of each train car, and the itinerary was notified to the Japanese side. It is said that the Japanese side has given safety guarantees. A group of personnel from the French Consulate also left Hankou on the same train. It takes about two days to travel from Hankou to Hong Kong by train, and it takes several days to travel from Hong Kong to Shanghai by ship. This move of the British Embassy to Shanghai is of a temporary nature. (Fourth Reuters Telegram)

[Hong Kong] The Hong Kong government issued a public announcement today stating that the British Chargé d'Affaires and the British Embassy staff who arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Hankou via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway had a fairly smooth first leg of their journey and no accidents occurred. However, for the sake of caution, their whereabouts will not be announced for the time being. After arriving in Guangzhou, they will change to gunboats to come to Hong Kong, and will arrive approximately on Sunday. (Fourth Reuters Telegram)

[Hankou] A special train carrying British Chargé d'Affaires Herbert, British Embassy staff, and forty other Britons departed Changsha safely at 12:35 last night. The special train consisted of five cars, each with a large British flag painted on the top. There were many women and children on board, as well as some French citizens. It is reported that an international special train will depart Hankou on December 10, carrying foreigners from Nanjing, Hankou, and other places to Guangzhou, and then to Hong Kong, because as the Japanese army goes deep along the river, if foreigners do not evacuate at this time, it is feared that transportation will be blocked in the future, making it difficult to leave the country.

British Foreign Secretary Meets with US Chargé d'Affaires, France Increases Naval Strength in the Far East

### Japanese Military Parade in Shanghai Criticized Harshly by British Newspapers

Believed that the intention is difficult to understand, fortunately, the incident was not significant

[London] London's morning newspapers all severely criticized the Japanese military parade in the Shanghai International Settlement. The Daily Telegraph pointed out that this was a completely unnecessary provocative parade, and it was fortunate that the unexpected consequences of the parade were not severe. This is truly remarkable. The settlement police seem to have maintained surprisingly good order in this environment. The good fortune and perseverance of the settlement residents allowed this occasional event to not escalate into a massacre. However, this result was not thanks to the Japanese military parade. Could it be hoped that such parades by the Japanese military would not lead to unexpected incidents that are even greater than this? This is something that cannot help but make people question. After all, Japan's undeclared war is not against the International Settlement, so this kind of parade is not a victory parade in conquered territory. The Times also had an editorial entitled "The Vanity of Shanghai," stating that Japan often exposes its great weaknesses in front of the world in a very obvious way. These weaknesses are often seen in the narrowness of the psychology and actions of Japanese soldiers. Yesterday's events were further proof of this. Yesterday's parade, even if it did not cause accidents, was just a tactless show of force. In its true form, this is merely a product of Japanese familiarity and nerves, and what is noteworthy is that this act adequately demonstrates the attitude of the Japanese military toward all foreign rights in China. As for the Shanghai Municipal Council, it can be content that nothing more serious happened, it is said. The News Chronicle said that it is unclear what the Japanese military intended to do with this move. Japan's actions have tested the Shanghai International Settlement, and the settlement police have taken good measures, it is said. The Manchester Guardian reported that the Japanese military's decision to parade through the International Settlement was peculiar, and it is almost impossible to prevent people from suspecting that the Japanese military hopes to create an excuse to strengthen its control over the settlement. Fortunately, the settlement authorities have the ability to maintain order independently, which just proves their folly, it is said. (Reuters dispatch of the 4th)

[London] Regarding the Japanese army's parade through the Shanghai International Settlement, the British provincial newspapers commented with rather strong language. The Manchester Guardian stated that Japan has not yet conquered the Shanghai International Settlement, yet it held its first victory parade within the International Settlement. If it is said that boasting of military prowess to the major powers is a common human sentiment and excusable, then it might as well choose a less provocative method to do so. Why is it necessary to have a large armed contingent pass through the settlement? Assuming that this kind of arrogant behavior is a kind of test, it is nothing more than wanting to use it to prove whether the settlement authorities, being obstructed by the Japanese military, can maintain order without the assistance of the Japanese military. The Yorkshire Post, which is known as the mouthpiece of Foreign Secretary Eden, also recognized this move as a Japanese provocation. The newspaper stated that the Japanese military insisted on parading through the settlement, which must be due to the extreme elements among the Japanese militarists deliberately creating incidents in order to find an excuse to occupy the settlement. If this were not the case, then it would truly be incomprehensible. Or perhaps this occasional event is not too unusual, and it is greatly remarkable that the International Settlement authorities were able to handle it well so that this event did not evolve into a more serious situation. In short, the attitude of the Tokyo government is difficult to understand. The only possible explanation is that it believes that the democratic countries are weak and incompetent. If this is the case, then the only way to deal with it is to accelerate the expansion of military equipment. (Havas dispatch of the 4th)

[London] Regarding the bombing incident during the Japanese military parade in the Shanghai International Settlement, all parties are afraid that Japan will take action because of this. The News Chronicle mentioned Japan's protest against the "anti-Japanese activities" of Chinese leaders in Hong Kong, saying that the Conservative government can generously tolerate direct attacks on the British national emblem, or attempts to direct British policy in any place where the British flag flies, or make people feel unfathomable, it is said.

### Five Japanese Military Trucks Loaded with Goods Drove from the French Concession to the South City Yesterday

Stopped by French patrols, and after negotiations, escorts were sent to accompany them through. The Municipal Council declared that it had not entered into an agreement with the Japanese side.

According to Havas News Agency's local news, five Japanese military trucks, loaded with grain, were heading to the South City around 10:30 this morning. When they reached the entrance of the French Concession on the Bund, they were stopped by French police. The person in charge of the concession explained to a reporter from this agency that it was a misunderstanding, because the French Concession authorities had not received any prior notification. Therefore, in accordance with the current regulations of the concession, they stopped the Japanese military trucks from proceeding. Immediately afterward, the police station designated a route and sent officers to escort the vehicles, allowing them to drive to the South City.

The concession authorities did not enter into an agreement. The Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council, in order to prevent misunderstandings from arising outside about the situation, hereby declares that on the evening of the 3rd of this month, the Police Commissioner of this Council and the Japanese military representative did not enter into any agreement. Because before the Japanese army withdrew from Nanjing Road, the representative of its commander had a conversation with the Police Commissioner of this Council and raised several points. Then the Japanese officials recorded these points in a document. The Police Commissioner of this Council strongly stated to the Japanese side that he had no authority to enter into any agreement. And to explain that the document was not intended as an agreement, he wrote on the document that he had read and understood this document and would convey its contents to the Municipal Council, etc. The Director also solemnly declared to the Japanese side that he could not sign any agreement regarding the passage of the Japanese army through the International Settlement.

The Municipal Council now also wants to declare that before the Japanese army entered the concession for a parade, the representative of this Council strongly stated to the Japanese authorities that it was not appropriate to conduct such a parade at this time.

Regarding the incident that occurred on the 3rd of this month (Friday), the Municipal Council has prepared a detailed report and submitted it to the Consular Body.

Contents of the memorandum published in Japanese newspapers. Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Joint News reported that after the Nanjing Road incident, the Japanese army believed that the situation was serious. The representative of the Japanese army commander, Colonel Kusumoto, negotiated with the Municipal Council authorities, and at the same time exchanged memoranda with the Police Commissioner of the Municipal Council, Nallat. The contents are divided into four items: ㊀ The Japanese army may pass through the International Settlement at any time without notice when it deems it necessary in the future; ㊁ In the future, the Municipal Council should make sufficient efforts to prevent the recurrence of the same incident; ㊂ In the future, if the same incident occurs again, the Japanese army believes that the Municipal Council does not have the strength to maintain local security, and the Japanese army will take independent action; ㊃ If the Japanese army believes that the Municipal Council's crackdown has shortcomings, the Japanese army may take independent measures and take appropriate actions such as search and inspection.

Yesterday at 1:02 PM, when the Japanese military parade passed the intersection of Edward Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, a person suddenly jumped down from a high place and shouted "Long live the Republic of China." As a result, he fell and injured his head and died. It has now been found that this person's name is Yang Jianping, and he is a craftsman at the Crowd Neon Light Company at No. 190 Xafie Road. On that day, he was sent to the top of Nanyang Automobile at No. 860 Edward Road to repair the neon lights of the Red Ruby Cigarette advertisement clock. Yang's body has been reported to the Special First Court by the Chengdu Road Police Station yesterday morning. The inspector Song Genshan, forensic doctors Wei Ligong, Zhang Yan, inspected and verified that he died of a broken head and femur. He ordered his wife to sign an affidavit and receive the body for coffin burial. The body of the person who threw a bomb at the Japanese army on Nanjing Road and was arrested and killed yesterday was not sent to the morgue for inspection.

### Efforts from All Sides to Rescue Refugees

Chinese Red Cross handles education The Shanghai Relief Society of the Chinese Red Cross, in order to improve the situation of the refugees, has organized an Education Committee to handle the education of 300,000 disaster victims in the two special zones and the refugee area in the South City. Chen Heqin was appointed as the chairman of the committee, and more than ten people including Liu Zhanen and Zheng Xigu were appointed as committee members. It is reported that the association has held meetings many times to prepare for the implementation, and now has a considerable number of clues, and classes will be started soon. It is heard that on the one hand, personnel are being sent to various shelters to inspect school buildings and equipment. On the other hand, it plans to recruit a large number of volunteer teachers to serve in various places. These teachers must be qualified with ㊀ strong physique, ㊁ at least junior high school graduate, and ㊂ have considerable education experience. It is very important to check the education work. It is hoped that my young patriotic comrades can actively participate. If there are such volunteers, please list ㊀ name, ㊁ age, ㊂ last graduated school, ㊃ education experience, ㊄ detailed current address, and directly send a letter to Room 418, No. 169 Yuanmingyuan Road, this city, to the secretary of the association, Zhao Chuanjia, to register first. If it is satisfactory, the association will send a letter to invite you for an interview to make a decision. The association is purely service-oriented, so it can only subsidize the volunteer teachers for transportation expenses each month.

The City West Federation provides long-term relief. The Shanghai City West United Relief Association held a meeting yesterday and resolved that although the refugees wandering on the streets of Shanghai have been sheltered by various means, there are still tens of thousands of people suffering from exposure and sleeping in the open. The number of people who are freezing, starving, and dying of illness is increasing day by day. Therefore, the association has decided to expand the scope of diagnosis and treatment and provide medicines to provide long-term relief. In addition to the relief team having distributed more than 100,000 pieces of cotton clothing and quilts, and more than hundreds of thousands of loaves of bread and cakes, donations are still being actively sought from all walks of life for continued distribution. As for the diagnosis and treatment team, it has hired the Chinese medicine doctor Tao Renqing to provide free diagnosis and treatment. All street refugees who are sick can receive a diagnosis and treatment voucher from the association and go for treatment. Surgical diseases can also be provided with free medicines. The association has now printed a large number of diagnosis and treatment vouchers and urgently hopes that people from all walks of life will donate medicine expenses as much as possible and receive vouchers to distribute them to sick refugees to facilitate the process. This is a matter of good deeds and immeasurable merit. You can call 35627 to notify the association, and they will immediately send someone to come and discuss.

Distribution of clothes and quilts in the refugee area. The International Relief Society, considering the refugees in the South City refugee area are freezing and starving, has repeatedly appealed to all walks of life to solicit cotton clothes and cotton quilts. Now it has collected a considerable quantity and sent it to the area. Starting yesterday, it will be handed over to the district chiefs of the nine districts for distribution. However, according to the association, it is still not enough, especially children's clothing is urgently needed. It is hoped that all walks of life will continue to donate.

The nutrition of the refugees is properly allocated. The International Relief Society pays great attention to the daily nutrition of the refugees. The allocation of daily refugee food in the five shelters set up by the association is recorded below. The association purchases various food items for the refugees in bulk, so the price is slightly cheaper. The current daily supply for refugees is 1 jiao of national currency per person. Rice and beans, etc., account for 71.2%, fuel accounts for 13.4%, vegetables account for 11%, and oil and salt, etc., account for 4.4%. The weight of each item eaten by each refugee every day is as follows: 11 liang of rice and beans (adding beans to rice can prevent beriberi), 1.5 liang of vegetables, 0.5 liang of oil, and 0.25 liang of salt, soy sauce, etc., are all properly allocated.

### Zhangjia to Go to Chengdu

Zhangjia is scheduled to go to Chengdu within the day. The Sichuan Provincial Government telegraphed Chongqing on the 4th to inquire about the exact date of his arrival in Chengdu.

### Brief Biography of Panchen

Panchen Erdeni was born in 1883. In 1905, British troops entered Tibet, and the Dalai Lama fled. The Minister Resident in Tibet, You Tai, requested that Panchen concurrently manage the political affairs of the former Tibet, but he strongly declined and went to India to travel. He returned to Shiburen the following year. Panchen left Tibet in 1923 and arrived in Fulan via Gan and Liang. He arrived in Beijing the following year to meet with the authorities to report on Tibetan affairs and border development opinions, but was unsuccessful. Therefore, he traveled around Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui, Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia to promote Buddhism. Until the National Government established Nanjing, Panchen wholeheartedly supported it and set up an office in Beijing to prepare for contact. The government treated him very favorably. In 1932, he was specially appointed as the Western Border Propagation Commissioner. In the autumn of 1933, Panchen entered Beijing. He was appointed as a member of the National Government in the following year. On May 5, 1935, he was ordered to go to Qinghai to promote the faith. In 1936, the Dalai Lama passed away, and he planned to enter Tibet to preside over political affairs, but he was delayed on the journey. He was worried about the national crisis and passed away in Yushu on the morning of the 1st of this month, at the age of 55. Grand Master Panchen passed away due to illness in Yushu on the morning of the 1st. Liu Wenhui telegraphed his condolences on the 3rd. The special envoy to welcome Panchen, Zhao Shouyu, will lead the guards back to the central government via Kangding to report.

The Panchen Office in Qinghai recently received a telegram from the Western Border Propagation Commissioner's Office stating that Grand Master Panchen was seriously ill due to concerns about the serious national crisis and his medical treatment was ineffective. He passed away at the Yushu Danbucang Office at 2:50 AM on the 1st.

### The Dagu Ice River Period is Approaching Customs Regulations for Shipping Methods

The Haiming Lightship is Anchored and Illuminating Broken Ice Ship to Send Pilots Guiding Sailing Ships Should Prepare Three Months of Food and Fuel

The customs authorities believe that winter has arrived and the Dagu River-Blocking Sand and the Haihe River will soon be frozen. Regarding winter shipping and information on ice formation in the Bohai Bay, special regulations have been formulated. The Inspection and Engineering Department instructed the local merchants to comply with them in unison. The details are extracted and recorded as follows:

Customs Announcement. It has been found that the depth of the Dagu River-Blocking Sand waterway has now reached 1.07 meters (3.5 feet) below the Dagu benchmark level, and the average at high tide in winter is about 2.13 meters (7 feet), so at ordinary high tide, the depth is 3.20 meters (10.5 feet). In addition to submitting various regulations and methods for winter shipping in the Dagu River-Blocking Sand and Haihe River to the Customs Superintendent for approval on record, the following is hereby listed. All Chinese and foreign merchants, etc., should be informed. Hereby announced.

Lightship Equipment. Around December 1st of this year, the Dagu Lightship will be removed. However, during the winter period, a winter lightship, the Haiming, will be set up in its original place to replace it. The lightship will display a black ball during the day and a white flash light at night, flashing once every twelve seconds, that is, bright for 1.5 seconds and dark for 10.5 seconds. In clear weather, it can be seen within 18.52 kilometers (10 nautical miles) around. If the lighting equipment of the Haiming Lightship encounters obstacles, the ship will use its searchlight to replace it, flashing towards the mouth of the sea once every ten seconds. Once the equipment is repaired, it will be restored to its original state.

Ice Formation. During the ice river period, the icebreaker Qingling stationed in Dagu will report the ice formation conditions at the mouth of Dagu, the time and height of the last high tide, and all urgent weather and route information via radio at 10:30 AM and 5:30 PM every day. However, the captains of each ship should stop broadcasting radio signals from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM to avoid interfering with the sound waves of the icebreaker communicating with its主管機關

Ice Ship Work. If Tianjin's ship agents want to use a pilot for their incoming ships, they should first discuss with the Yantai or Dalian agents of each company to inform the Dagu Pilot Company by telegram when the ship departs, stating the date and time of the ship's departure and the estimated date of arrival at the mouth of Dagu, in order to handle the matter. Once the ship arrives at the Dagu River-Blocking Sand, if it is feasible, a pilot will be sent on the icebreaker to wait for the ship to arrive in order to guide it.

Precautions. ㊀ During the ice formation period, barges must not sail outside the mouth of the river unless each tugboat is towing one. ㊁ When the ice conditions are serious, all the actions of each ship should be under the command of the person in charge of icebreaking work. ㊂ During the winter period, the captains of each ship should not sail the ships past the River-Blocking Sand without the guidance of a pilot to avoid danger. ㊃ During the winter period (that is, from December 15th of this year to March 15th of next year), all ships coming to Tianjin must prepare sufficient necessities, such as fresh water, fuel, and all food, to avoid any shortage.

### The Political Significance and Effect of Japan Establishing the Imperial General Headquarters

— Written by Miyazawa Toshiyoshi, Translated by 弸中

(Translated from Central Review)

Not long ago, two noteworthy news items emerged from Tokyo. One was Japan's establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters to cope with China's prolonged resistance, and the other was Japan's formal declaration of war against China. Although the latter remains "unimplemented," the former—the establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters—was officially announced on November 20. The latest issue (December) of Central Review carries an article by Miyazawa Toshiyoshi on the Imperial General Headquarters, discussing the significance and effects of its establishment. Although his words seem guarded and not entirely candid, they are still worth reading. Therefore, I am translating it for readers. However, the first half of the article is not particularly important, so it is omitted. The fourth section is also omitted after translation to save space.—Translator

(I)

What political significance and effects does the establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters have at this time?

The Imperial General Headquarters has regulations in the "Wartime Imperial General Headquarters Ordinance" (Meiji 36 Imperial Edict No. 293). Article 1 of the ordinance stipulates, "Under the authority of the Emperor, a supreme command headquarters shall be established, called the Imperial General Headquarters." Article 2 stipulates, "The Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff (i.e., the Chief of the Naval General Staff Department today) shall each be the head of their staff, serving in the inner court, participating in operations, examining the ultimate objectives, and planning the coordinated response of the army and navy." According to these regulations, the Imperial General Headquarters is, in fact, the supreme command headquarters under the Emperor's authority. Although it does not have the highest departments of staff and various agencies, the tasks of the so-called highest departments of staff and various agencies all belong to command affairs, focusing exclusively on "examining the ultimate objectives during wartime and planning the coordinated response of the army and navy." As for general administrative affairs, they are not within its authority.

Therefore, the establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters has no direct impact on the Cabinet itself. The Ministers of State remain responsible for assisting the Emperor in state affairs, and deliberating on the highest policies of state remains their exclusive duty.

Of course, the command headquarters and the executive branch cannot be completely unrelated even in peacetime, but their relationship is even closer during wartime. Therefore, "although the Imperial General Headquarters is a purely command organization, completely unrelated to administrative organs, in practice, there will undoubtedly be many connections between the command headquarters and the administrative branch" (Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, November 5). Under the wartime system, state affairs and command affairs are closely linked. In handling matters, at least the important parts, in fact, still require mutual consultation and action. Therefore, most of the state affairs are, in fact, interfered with by the command headquarters. However, the Imperial General Headquarters, at least as stipulated by the Wartime Imperial General Headquarters Ordinance, is only the highest command headquarters and is by no means responsible for state affairs, and it is not allowed to perform the task of assisting in state affairs.

(II)

Thinking about it this way, the so-called establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters is nothing more than a temporary merger of the General Staff Headquarters and the Naval General Staff Department. It has no impact on the Cabinet itself, and it is clearly without any effect of centralization or integration on the political system.

However, in political reality, especially under the current circumstances, the establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters cannot be simply regarded as a temporary merger of the General Staff Headquarters and the Naval General Staff Department. In fact, the establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters, from the perspective of the executive branch, is equivalent to strengthening the command headquarters, or the actual political superiority of the command headquarters. Furthermore, in terms of the political system, doesn't the establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters contain the effect of "forming centralization and integration with the command headquarters as the guiding force"? Thinking about it this way, it has very important significance.

According to newspaper reports: the establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters will be accompanied by a fundamental reform of the cabinet system. For example, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun (evening edition) on November 2 reported that the establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters would also consider fundamental reforms to the cabinet system, saying, "Regarding the Imperial General Headquarters issue, the command headquarters is strongly advocating its necessity, and the government naturally cannot object to it. However, regarding the major reorganization of the current cabinet and the reform of the cabinet system, starting with Internal Minister Baba, there are various dissenting opinions among the cabinet members. If it is to be implemented decisively, a great determination is necessary." On the same day, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, regarding the attempt to fundamentally reform the cabinet system, also listed the following three points: ㊀ Establish a Cabinet Personnel Bureau to control all powers related to personnel appointments. ㊁ Revise the Civil Service Appointment Ordinance, expand and strengthen the scope of free appointment, in order to open up the deadlocked administration of various ministries. ㊂ Because the Ordinance on Guaranteeing the Status of Officials guarantees the status of officials, which反而办事迟滞, it is necessary to abolish the ordinance, eliminate the accumulated弊病 of the officialdom, and restore the officialdom to an organization that is united as a nation." In addition, the Yomiuri Shimbun on the same day also reported that the establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters "will attempt to fundamentally reform the cabinet system, which has been a long-standing issue, separating the Ministers of State from the administrative heads of various departments, in order to strengthen the cabinet system. This proposal has gradually matured," and so on.

(III)

This aspect of reform is very important. It is not a reform of the command organization, but a reform of the general administrative organization; it is not just a reform for temporary convenience, but a reform of a permanent system. It wants to fundamentally reform the separatist cabinet system, which was previously based on the principle of separation of powers among the ministers of various departments; and reform it into centralization and integration.

It is said that the military is strongly advocating this type of reform, but due to various objections, it does not seem to have been realized yet. Although newspapers have reported the news that the Imperial General Headquarters will be established recently, they have not mentioned the reform of the cabinet system at all. On the contrary, they have reported the opinions of the army, saying that the purpose of establishing the Imperial General Headquarters is entirely to strengthen the organization and guidance of operations during wartime. Within this organization, people other than military personnel, such as the President of the Privy Council and the Prime Minister, do not participate in the 擘畫, and a military government-type organization will naturally not be produced (Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, November 12).

However, as mentioned above, this direction of reform is precisely the reform most required under the wartime system. Therefore, even if this reform theory temporarily subsides now, as long as the wartime system continues in the future, this reform is very likely to become a reality. Newspapers are also reporting this way now: "As a result of the establishment of the Imperial General Headquarters, various matters related to operations can be carried out in a relatively agile state. As a result, the administrative function of the administrative branch will also become more active than before. For this reason, it seems that the military is also hoping for appropriate strengthening work to be done on the cabinet (Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, December 12)." We really need to pay close attention to this point!

War requires the political system to undergo various reforms. Here, the most important thing for us is what meaning these reforms will have for us after the war ends. Of course, the Imperial General Headquarters can not only be established temporarily during wartime or emergencies, and its duties are limited to command affairs; however, the reform of the cabinet system has the possibility of continuing after the war ends, and the duties of the cabinet are related to the entire state affairs. Here lies the important meaning of the cabinet reform. As for the establishment of the wartime Imperial General Headquarters, even if the Imperial General Headquarters itself has no direct impact on the cabinet system, the wartime system will gradually become more wartime-like, and as a result, the cabinet system cannot but undergo some degree of reform. Thinking about it this way, this issue has an importance worth noting.

### International Silver Agreement Expires at Year-End, Not Renewed

Market Future Uncertain, Japan May Use Chinese Tariffs to Demand Recognition of the Changed Situation from Various Countries

[London] The silver agreement concluded in 1933 will expire at the end of this year. According to a statistical report published today, the agreement will not be renewed and will be allowed to expire naturally. The important question at present is whether the precarious balance around the market will be overturned by the expiration of the agreement. This depends on the reaction of the US authorities and their willingness to absorb the increased supply at current prices. This move will be determined solely by the reaction of a few people in the United States. What can be speculated now is that the expiration of the agreement will be reflected in a larger amount of silver being sold on the world market. As for the large amount of silver recently shipped from China to London for storage, there is no question of it being sold in the near future. However, there is some doubt as to whether this will actually happen. If China's exchange reserves are under real pressure, this may soon become a reality, and the Chinese authorities will have to start selling their silver reserves. Furthermore, since the international agreement has expired, it is doubtful whether the Sino-US silver agreement can last. The silver confiscated by Japan in the occupied Chinese territories may also be sold. It is feared that the situation will become more complicated, as Japan will inevitably take this step when the need to collect resources that can be transported out becomes more urgent. The report concludes that, from the current situation, the critical period for the market is ahead, and from the market's perspective, the fact that the 1933 silver agreement is about to expire has not received the attention it deserves. (Reuters, 4th)

[London] The Financial News today published a long article discussing the future of Far Eastern securities, stating that Japan may use the issue of China's tariffs to repay foreign debts as a tool to demand tacit approval of its demands on China from the major powers. The report also mentioned Japan's fear of being unable to repay its debts, stating that this possibility does not yet exist, as Japan would never be able to carry out large-scale development plans on the mainland if it destroyed its financial credit in the West. Moreover, more than half of the domestic and foreign debts are held by domestic people, and they also hold a portion of the Chinese tariff loans. The Manchester Guardian reported on the Chinese customs report, mentioning the surprising publications issued by China since the Sino-Japanese conflict, and stated that Germany's trade with China, in both exports and imports, is lower than that of the United Kingdom and the United States. Although China has suffered significant losses due to the war, its trade in the first nine months of this year has still been able to maintain to an extent that is surprising, and its import surplus has decreased by almost 42 million yuan. (Reuters, 4th)

[Paris] The national defense budget passed by the Chamber of Deputies last night totaled 5,400,000,000 francs. The Minister of War, Daladier, delivered a lengthy speech, stating that it was absolutely impossible to shorten the term of military service during this period of international tension. He also denied the allegations made by the right-wing that part of the 10,000,000,000 francs of military spending had been used elsewhere, and stated that the defenses of the border areas between France and Switzerland and Belgium had been strengthened. According to his wishes, the defensive works on the French borders must reach an impregnable level. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

[Paris] The bill proposed by the government to increase the salaries of civil servants, after being passed by the Chamber of Deputies on the 26th of last month, has now also been unanimously passed by the Senate. This bill has therefore been enacted. According to this bill, the government's annual expenditure will increase by as much as 1,700,000,000 francs. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)

[Paris] The Civil Service Bill, which almost toppled the French government last week, was unanimously passed by the Senate yesterday. The bill stipulates that, due to the large increase in the cost of living, civil servants' salaries will be increased across the board. When the bill was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies, the Socialist Party members strongly opposed it, but it was approved by the Finance Committee, thus avoiding a cabinet crisis. (Reuters, 4th)

### Italy Recognizes Puppet State, We Protest to the League of Nations

And Lodge the Same Protest with the Italian Envoy, Pointing Out Italy's Breach of Contract and Failure to Abide by League of Nations Resolutions

[Geneva] The Secretariat of the League of Nations has recently received a note from the Chinese government protesting against Italy's recognition of "Manchukuo," stating that the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem of the League of Nations General Assembly passed a resolution in 1933 not to recognize "Manchukuo." Italy, as a member state of the League of Nations, should be bound by this resolution, and its recognition of the "Manchukuo government" is a violation of this commitment. (Havas News Agency, 4th)

[Geneva] The note delivered to the Secretariat of the League of Nations by Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese government's representative to the League of Nations, included a protest letter sent by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chong-hui to Italian Ambassador to China, Count Galeazzo Ciano, on the 2nd of this month, requesting the Secretariat of the League of Nations to separately inform each member state of the League of Nations. The protest letter stated that Italy's recognition of "Manchukuo" violates the Washington Nine-Power Treaty signed by Italy and is in conflict with the Covenant of the League of Nations and the resolutions of the League of Nations on the Sino-Japanese dispute. Therefore, the Chinese government is lodging a protest. (Havas, 4th)

### French Chamber of Deputies Passes National Defense Budget

No Shortening of Military Service

[Paris] The French Chamber of Deputies today passed the 1938 national defense budget, with expenditures for the French mainland army amounting to US$171,900,024 and expenditures for the colonial army amounting to US$52,921,542. During the discussion of the bill, Defense Minister Daladier said that if a new war breaks out, he believes that the battleground will definitely not be in the area of the European War of 1914, but in North Africa. Therefore, we must make the defense of the Tunisian border as solid as metal. In terms of national defense, there are more than one million German troops outside the northern border, 300,000 Italian troops outside the southern border, and France only has 378,000 troops. (National Telegraph, 4th)

[Paris] French Army Chief Daladier gave a speech in the Chamber of Deputies today on the national defense budget, saying that due to the turmoil in Europe, the French government will definitely not shorten the military service period for the people. Daladier also said that the standing army in France is only 387,000 people, while Germany has 1 million people, and Italy has a total of 300,000 people, excluding those in Libya, Abyssinia, and Spain. (Reuters, 3rd)

### International Relief Society Sets Up Hospital to Aid Lepers

The Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge has spacious hospital buildings and complete equipment, and is the only large-scale hospital in the city. After our army withdrew from Shanghai, a large number of cavalry troops were stationed near the hospital. It is now learned that the Japanese side has converted the hospital into a rear hospital to treat wounded soldiers. However, there are still more than 100 lepers in the hospital who have not been moved out. Now that the Japanese side has converted it into a rear hospital, it will be difficult for them to continue to stay. It is heard that the International Relief Society has decided to take in and aid the lepers, and has recently built a temporary isolation hospital in the Fourth Refugee Camp to accommodate them. At the same time, doctors who treat leprosy are also being hired.

### Shops on Beijing Road Close Early

Beijing Road, starting from the Bund, was once a prosperous banking and finance center. Now that the commercial center of gravity has shifted inland, there are banks and finance houses with no business, and the overnight interest rate is also extremely low. Also, west of Fujian Road on Beijing Road, there are furniture stores and general merchandise stalls. Due to sluggish business, they are already closing their doors around 5:30 PM. However, the market west of Beinicheng Bridge is better.

### Xiushan Steamer's Maiden Voyage to Chongming Leads to Disaster Due to Misunderstanding

No Prior Notice Given to Garrison - Machine Gun Fire Kills Ship Owner

The British Taikoo Company's steamer Xiushan, which sailed from Shanghai to Chongming yesterday morning, encountered gunfire upon entering the port because the shore troops had not been notified of the ship's arrival beforehand, resulting in a misunderstanding. The ship owner and sailors were accidentally wounded, and the ship owner died from his injuries. The detailed account is as follows:

Carrying Passengers to Chongming: After the outbreak of hostilities, traffic between Shanghai and Chongming was immediately cut off. This time, in response to the requests of passengers traveling to Chongming, the Taikoo Company specially dispatched the Xiushan steamer to carry passengers from Shanghai to Chongming at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. Fearing obstruction along the way, the British Consulate and the Taikoo Company each sent two Westerners to accompany the ship, and four British soldiers were sent on board to provide protection in case of inspection along the way. The ship arrived at Chongming Port at around 10:00 a.m.

Misunderstanding Arises: If the Xiushan steamer could have notified the garrison in advance or sent a small boat into the port to explain that it was a passenger ship upon arrival, the accident could have been avoided. When the steamer approached Chongming Port, the garrison, upon seeing it, immediately fired warning shots with rifles. The steamer did not stop but continued forward as usual, only raising the ship's flag signal. Unfortunately, the garrison did not understand and, seeing the ship still speeding onward, a misunderstanding arose, leading to the shooting.

Crew Members Wounded: At 10:40 a.m., the land-based garrison first fired rifles. When the steamer still did not stop, they used machine guns to fire upon it. All crew members and passengers on board immediately lay prone on the deck. Tang Likun, the ship owner, was on the bridge, and Wan Silin, the sailor foreman, was on the deck, when they were hit by machine gun fire. Tang Likun was hit by a bullet that entered his left temple and exited his right forehead. Wan Silin was shot in the chest. Both suffered serious injuries.

Returning to Shanghai: After the incident, the Xiushan steamer dared not linger in Chongming Port and immediately turned around and sailed back to Shanghai at approximately 10:55 a.m. The passengers remained on the same ship and returned to Shanghai at 2:30 p.m. The ship docked at Taikoo's Pier No. 4 on the Bund in the French Concession. The injured Tang and Wan were immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.

Ship Owner Dies: After being wounded, ship owner Tang Likun was transported back to Shanghai on the ship. His family was notified, and he was rushed to Renji Hospital. Despite the careful diagnosis and surgery performed by Chief Surgeon Chen Cheng, the injuries were too severe, and he died at 6:00 p.m. The hospital then transported the body to the Chinese Funeral Parlor for preparation.

### Coarse Grain Industry Orders Rice: Shunzhi Arrives in Shanghai

20,100 Bags in Total: Distribution Method Decided - Fourth Batch of Foreign Rice Begins Unloading and Delivery to Stores Yesterday - Purchasing Jiangzhe Rice, Wheat, and Beans

The Public Concession Bureau and the South China Rice Industry Company are purchasing foreign rice. The fourth batch of 30,000 bags of foreign rice, purchased on their behalf by the Dafoe Company, began unloading yesterday morning. The first batch of Vietnamese rice ordered by the Coarse Grain Industry Association was transported by the Shunzhi and arrived in port yesterday morning. Details of the situation are as follows:

Coarse Grain Association's Rice Arrives in Shanghai: To regulate the city's food supply, the Coarse Grain Association's member rice stores, with the assistance of the French Concession Bureau, ordered a large quantity of foreign rice from Vietnam. The first batch, transported by the British ship Shunzhi, managed by the British Xia Laochen Company, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf Jiangxin Buoy in the French Concession. The ship carried a total of 20,100 bags of foreign rice, transported on behalf of the Yongda Company. The company began unloading the cargo at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, hiring a large number of trucks. Part of the cargo was put into warehouses, while the rest was picked up by various pre-arranged rice stores and factories.

Distribution Method Already Decided: The Coarse Grain Industry's purchase of foreign rice from Vietnam was greatly assisted by the French Concession Bureau. The chairman of the Coarse Grain Industry Association, Gu Xinyi, owner of Yongda Grain Store, discussed the distribution method for the first batch of Vietnamese rice that arrived in Shanghai yesterday with the French Concession Bureau. It was decided that 8,000 bags would be distributed to 200 rice stores in the French Concession, such as Wanchang Yongda, with each store receiving 40 bags, to handle fair pricing. Another 1,000 bags would be supplied to charitable organizations for the needs of refugees. The rest would be sold at fair prices to Chinese-owned factories to maintain the food supply for workers in the factories. It is understood that the entire batch of foreign rice was pre-ordered before it arrived in Shanghai. Half of the second batch of rice, which has not yet arrived in Shanghai, has also been pre-ordered and is expected to arrive in port around the 15th of this month.

Four Batches Unloaded and Delivered to Stores: The fourth batch of 30,000 bags of foreign rice purchased by the South China Rice Company through the Dafoe Company was transported to Shanghai by the Taikoo Company's Zhejiang ship on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The Dafoe Company, together with representatives from the Rice Store Industry Association, hired more than 20 large trucks at the Bund Wharf on Sanma Road starting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to begin unloading the cargo and transporting it to 500 member rice stores in the two concessions. The French Concession's rice stores were delivered to first, so the French Police sent French officers to protect the wharf and escort the trucks. After the French Concession was finished, the trucks delivered to the Public Concession's rice stores. According to personnel from the Rice Store Industry Association who were handling the unloading at the wharf, it is expected that 5,000 to 6,000 bags can be unloaded each day, and it will take another four or five days to unload the entire quantity.

Rice Stores Receiving Rice and Resuming Retail Sales: The 500 registered rice stores in the Public Concession and the French Concession have received three batches of foreign rice. Although each has received 120 bags, due to the high demand in the market, all rice stores sold out within three days, causing some restaurants to temporarily suspend business due to a lack of rice. Yesterday, the rice stores in the French Concession that had received rice had resumed retail sales as usual. Part of the Public Concession's rice stores will also be able to receive rice and open for business today. The retail price remains 8.5 cents per city catty, with a limit of one yuan per person.

Large Quantities of Rice to Arrive Soon: It is understood that large quantities of domestic and foreign rice will continue to arrive in Shanghai this month: 1. The second batch of Vietnamese rice ordered by the Coarse Grain Industry is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th of this month. 2. The French Dafoe Company, entrusted by Chinese and foreign trading companies to purchase approximately 3,000 tons of Western rice, will be transported by the Postal Steamship Company's Liro freighter and is scheduled to arrive on the 14th. 3. Members of the Coarse Grain, Bean, and Rice Store Industry Association, including Rencheng, Dacheng, Shenyu, Shenchang, and Wanxingyu, have requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Association to issue certificates and send personnel to Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, Taixian, Dongtai, and Tongzhou in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to purchase large quantities of domestic rice, wheat, soybeans, and red beans, totaling more than 300,000 bags. Once completed, the rice will be loaded onto foreign ships and transported to Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply.

### Patriotic Sailors Arrive in Hong Kong from England

To Return to Shanghai by Ship Soon

Thirty-six Chinese sailors who served on the British ship "Sherkworth," which sailed between Hong Kong and Sydney, Australia, resigned en masse due to their patriotic sentiments because the ship was leased to others and sailed to Dalian. They did not want to be used by others. At the time, the ship owner accused the sailors of "disobeying orders" and filed a lawsuit in court, detaining all thirty-six people in the police station. After negotiations by our Consul General in Australia and the hiring of lawyers to defend them in court, the court ruled that the incident was out of patriotism and declared them innocent. These thirty-six people were allowed to leave the ship and return to their country. All travel expenses of 500 pounds were ordered to be paid half by the ship owner and the other half by our consulate. The sailors have now returned to China from Sydney on the British Company's Nanjing ship. They arrived in Hong Kong yesterday (the 4th). Because the ship does not come to Shanghai, the sailors will transfer to another ship in Hong Kong to return to Shanghai.

### Pudong Transportation

Gaogiao Line Open and Unobstructed - Donggou and Yangjing Not Yet Restored

Pudong's east-west transportation, which had been interrupted for three days, was finally permitted yesterday for the British Mueller Company to operate a ferry at a wharf in Gaogiao. This was originally a temporary arrangement. However, it was learned this morning that the Japanese Naval Headquarters had approved the ship to operate on the Gaogiao line, so passengers were extremely crowded. The first trip in the morning had about 1,000 passengers. However, after arriving in Pudong, the inspection of goods was quite strict. As for the reason for the disruption of the Pudong ferry, related parties said that originally, those who flew foreign flags in Pudong were allowed to pass without obstruction. After investigation, it was found that most were Chinese who used foreigners as front men. After investigation at the customs ship registration office, most were still Chinese merchants, so all ferry services were stopped and detained. Changing flags is now being negotiated. It is said that only those purely operated by foreign businessmen can pass without obstruction. The investigation method involves checking the name of the registered household at customs and requiring the relevant consulate to contact the Japanese consulate to request the Naval Headquarters to issue a pass before the ferry line can be reopened. Therefore, it is feared that the Dongjiang and Yangjing wharfs will not be open for a week. It was also learned that since the British Mueller Company cleared the Gaogiao line for transportation between Shanghai and Pudong, the company dispatched two large ferries, Minna and Dina, yesterday, with two trips each in the morning and afternoon. The Shanghai side docked at the New Customs Wharf on Sanma Road. Order was maintained with the cooperation of the water and land police, and there was no major chaos. The Gaogiao side docked at the city ferry wharf, with no one interfering, and the large number of people caused overcrowding. Passengers suffered quite a bit. However, there were no problems transporting Pudong vegetables out, so large quantities of various vegetables arrived on both the morning and afternoon trips. Rumors that someone was conducting strict inspections were not confirmed, but the supply of cattle and sheep was still cut off. Only a small amount of slaughtered pork was brought out. Yesterday's ferry passengers were concentrated on one line because the Yangjing and Donggou lines had not yet opened, making it even more crowded. In total, there were more than 10,000 people. Those coming from Pudong included people from Fengxian, Nanchuan, and the Shanghai city's Tangqiao, Yangjing, Lujing, and Gaohang areas. Those going from Shanghai were mostly vegetable vendors carrying empty baskets. Regarding whether the Yangjing and Donggou lines can be restored in the short term, reporters investigated the ferry company, which said that due to military relations, negotiations have not yet yielded results. Even though the Gaogiao line has been opened, it is still a temporary arrangement.

### All Circles Enthusiastically Participate in One-Cent Movement

Commencement of Presentation of Commemorative Badges

The International Relief Association is conducting a daily one-cent donation campaign to provide relief to the people in distress. All circles are enthusiastically participating. The commemorative badge for the Association's one-cent donation has been made and will begin to be distributed to donors yesterday to mark the occasion. The details are as follows:

Enthusiastic Participation in One-Cent Donations: All circles are concerned about the people in distress and are enthusiastically participating in the one-cent donation campaign. The International Relief Association continued to receive 200 yuan from Zhu Liangming's grandmother, 100 yuan from Huanji, 69 yuan and 68 cents from all faculty and students of He'an Primary School, 50 yuan from Fukangzhuang, 5 yuan and 39 cents from the Gengyutang people, and many others donating three yuan or several people jointly donating three yuan.

Yushengchang and Others Pledge Long-Term Donations: The International Relief Association received a letter from Yushengchang Paper Company, stating, "Our company has received Circular No. 1968 from the Paper Industry Association, initiating a one-cent movement to provide relief to the disaster victims in this city. Our colleagues are fulfilling their mutual aid duty and doing our best. We are enclosing a list of monthly donations, totaling 74 yuan per month. We are sending it now and ask that you please check and receive it." Song Yaozhong and Song Shihua also donate three yuan each per month.

Commemorative Badges Exquisite and Beautiful: To commemorate the enthusiasm of the donors, the Association has specially prepared two-cent donation commemorative badges, which will be presented starting yesterday. All people or organizations that donate one cent for three yuan or more will receive one badge. The commemorative badge has the Association's emblem embedded in the center, surrounded by a blue border. It is small, exquisite, and beautiful to wear on the chest.

### Public Concession's Northern District to Open in Mid-Month

Xin Sheng News Agency reported that since the outbreak of hostilities in this city, the northern district of the Public Concession has almost entirely fallen into the war zone. Although the war has shifted westward, the Hongkou District and Yangshupu District are still under alert and have not been opened. It is learned from relevant parties that, after the Concession authorities have made every effort to plan, the order in the Concession is gradually being restored. At the same time, the area north of the Suzhou Creek has also been repeatedly consulted and is expected to be opened in the middle of this month, allowing Chinese and foreign residents to move back to live there. Also, the special situation in the area beyond the boundary of West Shanghai is also expected to be lifted at the same time. Therefore, the Concession will soon return to its former normal state.

### Christian Student Association to Hold Charity Bazaar

The Shanghai Christian Student Association will hold a charity bazaar on December 19 (Sunday) at the YWCA, 999 Jing'an Temple Road. Goods will be donated by all circles. All preparations are being carried out by students from various schools and are now actively underway. They are selling donation tickets that can be used to purchase goods at the bazaar. The Association will use the profits to provide relief to Shanghai refugees. Major companies and manufacturers are encouraged to donate or sell at cost and should contact the Student Department of the YWCA, the bazaar's office.

### Cilian Association to Thoroughly Rectify Various Shelters

Setting Hygiene Standards and Capacity - Sending Personnel for Investigation at Any Time

Since the Shanghai Cilian Association's Refugee Relief Branch took over the Shanghai Branch of the Refugee Relief Association of the Pre-Emergency Period, there have been many internal rectifications. It is learned that Nie Haifan, director of the Association's Shelter Group, has specially formulated eight "Instructions for Administrators of Shelters" in order to thoroughly rectify the various shelters under its jurisdiction. The instructions have been approved and distributed to each shelter for compliance. It is reported that the standards for improving the hygiene of refugees in the shelters, the number of refugees, the examination of the behavior of the staff, and the conditions of the food supply are specified in great detail. It is also learned that the Group has formulated a "Survey Table of General Conditions of Shelters" and sends personnel to each shelter for investigation at any time. After the implementation of this method, the shelters have been revitalized, and the results are quite significant.

### Four Hui Defeng Workers Die of Poisoning in Hong Kong

All Workers Sent from Shanghai - Five Others Severely Poisoned

On September 2 of this year, a hurricane struck Hong Kong. Dozens of Chinese and foreign merchant ships in Hong Kong were damaged by the wind, some sinking and some running aground. The total direct and indirect losses of ships and cargo amounted to at least 10 million yuan. At that time, the war in Shanghai was raging, and no one paid attention to this huge loss. Local Chinese insurance companies have prepared more than 800,000 yuan in compensation for the damage suffered by overseas Chinese in this disaster, while foreign insurance companies have paid out millions of yuan in this disaster. Some of the damaged ships have not yet been completely salvaged. One of the large tugboats of Hui Defeng, named Darelba, was also blown onto the beach in the Li Yumen sea area of Hong Kong by the hurricane on September 2. After the Shanghai headquarters received the news, it sent 39 workers to Hong Kong to salvage it. Eight of them had already returned to Shanghai, and 31 were still working in Hong Kong. The ship was carrying a large amount of white rice, and the workers first unloaded it. After two months, the moldy white rice in the ship was finally removed, and the ship was able to float on the sea. On the 10th of last month, the ship began to be towed to the opposite side of the Huangpu Shipyard in Hong Kong, preparing for repairs. On the 28th, nine more workers were sent to the cabin to clear out the remaining moldy rice. At that time, the workers glimpsed that a small hole had been pierced in the oil tank in the ship, and the stored gasoline had leaked out, mixed with the accumulated water and rotten rice in the cabin, emitting an extremely foul odor. The workers could not bear it and quickly plugged the small hole where the oil was leaking. Unexpectedly, the oil tank had been soaked in water for a long time, and the surrounding area was rusty and cracked. As soon as it was moved, the kerosene and poisonous gas in the oil tank were completely released. All nine workers were poisoned. Four workers, including Gu Dabao, Shen Genfa, Zhou Xiangzi, and Yao Yulian, died of poisoning immediately. The remaining five were also severely poisoned and have been sent to Hong Kong hospitals for treatment. Because all the workers were sent from Shanghai, the Hong Kong side has telegraphed Shanghai to report the incident.

### Shanghai First Special District Court Criminal Court Relocates Back to Original Site

Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road moved because it was close to the war zone and stray bullets were flying. The First Special District Court and the Gao Yi Branch Court decided to relocate to avoid danger. The First Special District Court moved to a part of the Zhirenyong Women's School on Weihaiwei Road to conduct business. However, the location was small and could only open one or two courtrooms. Furthermore, there were few offices, which caused many inconveniences in handling affairs. Initially, because there were few cases, it could barely be used. Now, civil and criminal cases have gradually increased, causing concerns about insufficient distribution. Now that the Songhu War has shifted westward, away from Shanghai, the order in the original site of the First Special District Court has gradually recovered, and there is no danger. Therefore, after consultation, it was decided that starting next Monday (the 6th), criminal cases will be relocated to the original site on North Zhejiang Road to be heard. Civil cases will still be heard as usual for the time being, but they will soon be completely relocated. President Guo has ordered the bailiffs to clean the original site. The prisoners to be arraigned on Monday will be tried at the original site on North Zhejiang Road.

### Issue of American Ships Laying Off Chinese Seafarers

Yellow Race to Disappear from Next Month - Shanghai and Hong Kong General Union Appeals by Telegram - Livelihoods of More Than 1,800 People Affected

Because the U.S. government passed the Shipping Subsidy Act, all regular mail ships traveling on the Far East Pacific (such as the Great American Company, which operates 17 mail ships on the Sino-American and World routes) and cargo ships on various European routes have been employing Chinese seafarers, waiters, servants, and cooks because of lower wages and longer working hours. It has now been decided that starting on January 1, 1938, all ships will uniformly lay off the Chinese seafarers, waiters, and cooks they employ and replace them with white people. From then on, there will be no people of the yellow race serving as seafarers, waiters, or cooks on American ships. The implementation of this fact has a huge impact on the livelihoods of Chinese seafarers. On the 2nd of last month, the Great American Company's Grant President first laid off 49 Chinese crew members, and the Chris Company laid off 39. More than 1,800 people will be laid off starting next month. After receiving reports from these seafarers who will be laid off, the Shanghai and Hong Kong Seafarers General Union has already sent a telegram to Ambassador Wang Zhengting in the United States, asking him to protest to the U.S. government. The telegram stated, in brief, that Chinese seafarers and workers sell their labor, work hard and diligently, and seek the lowest possible standard of living (omitted). Sino-American relations have always been cordial. Overseas Chinese travel and load goods on American ships, and American commerce in China occupies an important position in world trade, obtaining huge sums of money from the Chinese people every year. Is it too much for Chinese seafarers to work on American ships and earn meager wages? We urge you to protest to the U.S. government to stop the bill to exclude Chinese personnel and to promote the prosperity of the two countries' commerce.

### Recent Changes in Water Transportation Routes

Ende's New Beijing Resumes Shanghai-Ningbo Route - Liverpool Stops Sailing and Changes to Fuzhou

Recently, water transportation between Shanghai and the interior is entirely carried out by foreign shipping companies, but there are not many ships, and passenger and cargo transportation is extremely crowded. Freight rates have also increased sharply, which is a common phenomenon during wartime. The recent changes in the routes of various foreign ships are recorded below:

Liverpool Changes to Fuzhou

The Greek ship Liverpool, represented by the British Wah Lun Company, was originally scheduled to sail to Nantongzhou Tiansheng Port for the first time on the 5th and had already started selling passenger tickets. However, because the Wuhu, Wuxue, Pinghe, and Tonghe, four ships of the Taikoo Jardine and other companies, are already sailing on the line, and it is particularly difficult to transport cargo to Nantongzhou, the route was temporarily changed to Fuzhou. The first sailing date is scheduled for today from the Jinliyuan Wharf. The cargo to be loaded was settled yesterday.

Ende Still on Shanghai-Ningbo Route

The Huayi Shipping Company operates the Shanghai-Ningbo route with the Side and De Ping ships. In the middle of last month, due to the Ningbo River blockade, the Side was changed to the Shanghai-Tongzhou route, and the Shanghai-Ningbo route was operated by the De Ping alone. Now, because each sailing on that line is extremely crowded with passengers and cargo, and Ningbo natives in Shanghai have requested the company to find a way to adjust the transportation, the company has decided to have the Ende operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo route as usual. The first sailing date after the resumption is scheduled for 3:00 p.m. today. It is also learned that the Taikoo Company's New Beijing has also resumed sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route and will continue on to Wenzhou, so transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo will be even more convenient.

Shanghai-Tongzhou Route Operating as Usual

After news that the Japanese army had landed in the vicinity of Tongzhou, various parties in Shanghai were concerned about whether the only Shanghai-Tongzhou route between Shanghai and the interior would be affected and interrupted. Reporters inquired with the British Taikoo Company and Jardine Matheson, which operate on the line. The Wuxue, Wuhu, Pinghe, and Tonghe ships of the company are still operating normally between Shanghai and Tongzhou. Except for the temporary suspension of cargo transportation, it has not been suspended. The Pinghe sailed at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the Wuhu is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Tongzhou at 7:00 a.m. this morning, and the Tonghe is scheduled to leave on the 7th.

Increased Ships on North and South Routes

The British Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Companies are aware that passengers and cargo are fully loaded on each sailing to the Shanghai-Qingdao-Yantai-Weihai-Tianjin line and the Shanghai-Xiamen-Shantou-Hong Kong line. In order to clear the backlog of goods, they have decided to increase the number of ships on these routes. The ships operating on the two lines are Xinjiang, Shuntian, Shengjing, Shandong, Sichuan, Jinan, Desheng, Guisheng, Zesheng, and Fusheng, but they are all irregular liners. Also, the Jinan arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, carrying a large amount of fruit, kelp, peanuts, and other goods, and many passengers from Qingdao avoiding Shanghai. It is said that the situation in Qingdao is very critical, and residents have been ordered to leave the country to avoid disaster.

China-Japan Route Shortened

Domei News Agency, Nagasaki, 4th: Recently, the number of passengers and cargo traveling between Nagasaki and Shanghai has suddenly increased. As a result of negotiations between the Nagasaki branch of the Japan Mail Shipping Company and the Tokyo headquarters on how to deal with the situation, it was decided to shorten the Shanghai Maru route, which previously traveled between Kobe and Nagasaki via Nagasaki. From the 27th of this month, it will run only between Shanghai and Nagasaki.

### Chengdu Road Robbery Case: Four Robbers Captured

Janitor Arrests One Thief Each - Police Detectives Arrest Two Thieves

Zhang Peigen, who opened a printing shop in Nanshi, moved to No. 67, Lane 140, Chengdu Road after the outbreak of the war. At 8:30 a.m. yesterday (the 4th), five robbers suddenly broke into Zhang's house under the pretext of delivering a letter and threatened with handguns, intending to rob. At that time, Zhang Peigen and his driver, Zhang Langen, resisted and first detained the robber He Changfu, who was holding a gun, and seized a Mauser pistol with seven bullets. They also shouted "Thief!" A janitor from No. 1755 came and saw another thief, Zhang Bingsheng, trying to draw a gun to resist arrest. The janitor fired a shot first, and the bullet hit Zhang's pants. He was then captured, and another handgun with five bullets was seized. The remaining three robbers, named Wang Asi, Chen Chuanrong, and Wang Along, saw that the situation was not good and fled out the door. At that time, Feng Baishun, the chief detective of the Chengdu Road Police Station, detectives Wu Dekui, Xia Shuiquan, and Zhang Yousheng, were patrolling and went forward to arrest them. Except for Wang Along, who escaped, Wang Asi and Chen Fuchong were arrested one after another and taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. This morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court. Police lawyers Qian Xunjiu and Wang Yaotang requested a postponement. Judge Xiao questioned the four defendants briefly and ordered them to be detained for further questioning in seven days.

### Foreign Exchange Meanders Considerably

The Central Bank Constantly Maintains, Settlement Continues Unabated

Since escaping danger last week, the trend in local foreign exchange this week has been quite peaceful, and swap rates have also rapidly converged. At the beginning of the week, due to considerable U.S. dollar swaps by Japanese banks, the near-term was loose and the far-term tight, with swap rate differences reaching a substantial 6.25. Sterling, however, saw a relatively stable market sentiment due to the Central Bank's persistent selling intentions, with market prices repeatedly returning to a relaxed level of 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 25/100. As the end of the month approached, and settlements for grain became prevalent, the spot price of the U.S. dollar once tightened to 29.5 yuan. Although the Central Bank constantly maintained the price of sterling at 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 5/100, some foreign firms settled at only 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 21875/100000. By yesterday's midday close, sterling stood at 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 25/100, December at 21875/100000, and January at only 1 shilling, 1 pence, and 875/100000. The spot price of U.S. dollars was 29.5625 yuan, December at 31.25, and January at 28.875. The posted rates for sterling and U.S. dollars at the Central Bank and HSBC remained unchanged. Looking back at the week's foreign exchange activity, there has been considerable maneuvering, but overall, there seems to be little cause for concern. However, it is noted that among the general settlements of foreign firms, a considerable portion is invested in foreign stocks.

### Java Shipping Company Transports Relief Goods Free of Charge

Also Raises Funds in Batavia to Aid Chinese Refugees

The Dutch Java Shipping Company has always been enthusiastic about charity. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the company has shipped a large quantity of medicines and used clothing for refugees from Southeast Asia. The amount of quinine alone reached 560 cases, with estimated freight costs exceeding 1,600 guilders, equivalent to over 30,000 national currency units. These freight charges have been entirely waived. The company's Batavia head office also set up a movie theater and fishing platform at the Batavia night market on the 16th of last month. The income generated, exceeding one thousand guilders, was also entirely donated to a charity, specifically designated to aid Chinese refugees. Furthermore, a film screening venue was established in the Meibu night market to raise funds for refugees. The company's contribution to charitable causes in our country is undeniably significant and highly commendable.

### General Manager of the Municipal Council Thanks the Commander of the Volunteer Corps

After the cessation of hostilities, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the International Settlement was demobilized. At that time, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, Fessenden, visited the Volunteer Corps Headquarters. It is now reported that after the demobilization, Fessenden sent a letter of thanks to the Corps Commander, Colonel Grilias, and Colonel Grilias replied. The translated texts of the two letters are as follows: ❶ Fessenden's letter states, "During my daily inspections of the Volunteer Corps Headquarters, I was deeply impressed by the meticulous organization in the operation of all the institutions within the Corps. I also inspected the various divisions of the Volunteer Corps to observe how the orders issued by the Headquarters were implemented. The commanders of each unit were highly effective in their leadership, and all officers and members were conscientious in their duties, maintaining excellent discipline. All of this has deeply impressed me. The Council recognizes that the services of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps are essential to the residents, not only in defending the settlement but also in assisting the police force to maintain security within the settlement. Now that the Corps has been demobilized, I would like to take this opportunity to express the Council's sincere gratitude to all officers and members of the Corps on behalf of the Council." ❷ Grilias's letter states, "I have received and read your letter, and I am deeply grateful for your high praise of the services of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps during the emergency period. Your letter has been circulated to all units within the Corps, and the senior officers of each unit have requested that I, on behalf of the units they command, express our gratitude to you."
