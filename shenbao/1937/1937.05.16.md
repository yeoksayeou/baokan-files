### The Importance of Compiling Textbooks

— Ye Gongchao

From the establishment of the Tongwen Guan in the capital in the first year of Tongzhi (1862) advocated by the Zongli Yamen to the present, we have spent seventy-five years "learning foreign languages and translating Western books," but now Western textbooks are still used in Chinese universities, and people who do not know a Western language, especially English, still cannot obtain a proper modern education. In terms of academics, there are no international boundaries: those who study advanced knowledge often have to be proficient in several languages. It is reasonable for university students to learn foreign languages to absorb foreign culture. However, no independent country in the world relies entirely on foreign textbooks for the implementation of education. Advanced research can use foreign reference books, but at least the initial or basic textbooks should be in the national language. Introducing a new culture, especially a complex one like modern Western culture, is certainly not easy: to achieve a significant impact, long-term active effort is necessary. However, the method of introduction should be, after mastering the language of that culture, to gradually dissolve the main elements of that culture into the national language, so that the general educated population can be newly influenced by their own language.

Although the translation bureaus of the past, such as the Beijing Translation Bureau, the Tianjin Naval Academy, the Shanghai Arsenal, the Fuzhou Shipbuilding Bureau, and the hospitals of various Western missions, translated hundreds of books, they have all become historical relics, either due to abridged translations, inaccurate translations, outdated content, or excessive emphasis on immediate needs and neglect of theoretical foundations. They represent initial efforts, but because their vision was ultimately short-sighted, the results of their efforts did not have foundational value. As for the many books on natural sciences and law and politics translated from Japanese later, they also cannot meet our current needs for the above reasons.

Since the Republic of China, the authorities have repeatedly proposed establishing translation and compilation agencies (in the fourth year of the Republic, when Tang Hualong, and in the fourteenth year when Zhang Shizhao were in charge of the Ministry of Education, they both proposed that the state establish a translation and compilation institute), but none of them were implemented. Until recently, the government finally officially established a National Institute for Compilation and Translation, although its scale is not large, and its impact since its establishment has not yet been felt by people. Recently, some cultural organizations have also been engaged in translation and compilation, such as the China-America and China-France Boxer Indemnity Fund Committees and the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center, but they have not paid attention to textbooks, but only selected and translated some famous books, which can only provide some reference materials for students. Translating famous books is one thing, and translating textbooks is another.

Our government should quickly establish a middle school and university textbook compilation and translation institute, and engage in the compilation and translation of textbooks needed from high school to university in stages, divided into three phases: one, high school textbooks and related major reference books; two, university textbooks of a general nature and their related major reference books; three, major reference books for specialized disciplines. First, experts from various academic fields across the country should consult to determine the book list, and then select competent experts to engage in the translation and compilation work full-time, and their remuneration should be at least equal to that of ordinary university professors.

This kind of work cannot be handled by private individuals or booksellers. Private individuals are often forced by livelihood and are unwilling to take the risk of translating works that are more extensive and more specialized in nature, because this kind of translation requires too much effort and time, and the usual remuneration is too low, and it is absolutely impossible to maintain a living with this kind of work. Booksellers are naturally profit-oriented. Although they nominally say that they want to promote culture, in fact, no matter how important the work is, if they feel that there is no possibility of profit, they will absolutely not do such a foolish thing that is unprofitable. As a result, there are only novel works that cater to the tastes of the public, and very few works related to academics. Textbooks are not only academic, but also serious, so they will naturally not have much connection with translators and booksellers who take sales as a prerequisite. If we rely on the efforts of booksellers or private individuals, it is tantamount to willingly using Western, especially English, textbooks forever.

The teaching of Western languages is absolutely not to be neglected, but we learn Western languages because we want to use them as a tool, not to replace our own language. To be honest, we are Chinese, and we can only complete the education that our people should have based on the Chinese language. There is a popular mentality now that using Western textbooks is an honor, a sign of being superior in level. This mentality, on the one hand, is a manifestation of colonial consciousness, and on the other hand, it regards writing as a kind of spell, confusing the medium of transmission with the content. Although the most appropriate tool for conveying the content of Western culture is still its original language, since we cannot abandon our own language, we have to reluctantly move the treasures of others into our own home to the best of our ability, rely on the power of time to gradually adapt them to the new environment, and finally become our own property. Some people say that there are many materials that cannot be translated at all, and that the translation is even more difficult to read than the original. I admit that the difficulty of writing is indeed very great. Regarding scientific books, the first hurdle is the problem of translating terms. Most Western scientific terms come from Greek and Latin, and are not translated in modern Western languages, although the pronunciation is different. Of course, we can translate those that can be translated, and those that cannot be can be transliterated or use the original word. Borrowing words is a courtesy between languages and is not surprising. However, the more difficult ones are not single-word nouns, but phrase-like nouns. When encountering such examples, we have to discuss countermeasures together. As for the difficulties in terms of thinking, that is naturally a very complex problem, but since the publication of Mr. Sa Bendong's "Physics" and Mr. Jin Yuelin's "Logic" (both are university series), we cannot but admit that even extremely profound academics and thoughts can be expressed in our language.

Many university professors, who are used to seeing Western textbooks abroad, unconsciously confuse content and tools after returning to China, as if to talk about academics, it is necessary to use writing, in other words, if the use of Western writing is avoided in China, there can be no academic existence. These academic talents may be able to publish articles in foreign magazines, or even receive awards from foreign academies, but we dare say that they are definitely not pioneers in building Chinese academics. Their mentality is worth analyzing carefully. If it is said that there are no suitable Chinese textbooks, then the professors themselves should at least compile Chinese lecture notes or teach in Chinese. If there are available textbooks and they are not used, it is their laziness at work. This laziness is not only a fatal wound to our academic thinking, but simply a fatal wound to our national life.

### Bank of Japan Raises Gold Price

Says it Will Not Affect the Foreign Exchange Market

◎Osaka The Bank of Japan officially announced today that it will raise the value of gold purchased by the bank from 13 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 fen per momme (equivalent to 0.1325 ounces) to 14 yuan, 1 jiao, 3 fen and 7.5 hao. According to observations from the foreign exchange banking community, the Bank of Japan's increase in the purchase value of gold will not have any impact on the market. The Japanese financial market is already under strict currency management, and the relationship between gold and currency has been reduced to a very thin level. Moreover, the purpose of this change in the purchase price is entirely to encourage gold production and prevent smuggling, so it will definitely not have an impact on the foreign exchange market.

### An Analysis of the Results of the Japanese General Election (Part 2)

— Nagumo

It is no longer a question that the Hayashi Cabinet will fall soon. It is also inevitable that the fascist faction will adopt more effective tactics. What needs to be examined now is the relationship between the forces of all classes in Japan reflected in the results of this general election and the future of their development.

The reason for the dissolution of the parliament by the Hayashi Cabinet was: "The parliament's understanding of the current situation is insufficient..." The reason for the attack on the Hayashi Cabinet by the Minseito and Seiyukai parties was: "The government is destroying constitutional government..." On this point, it can be said that the banners of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are still liberal, while the Hayashi Cabinet represents the current control system. Although both liberalism and the control system are within the scope of capitalist development, the control system is the political and economic form of the period when imperialists are eager to carry out the re-division of colonies. The struggle between liberalism and the control system not only illustrates the intensification of the internal contradictions of the Japanese bourgeoisie, which is currently highly concentrated in capital, but also exposes the special weaknesses of Japanese capitalism. However, since the strengthening of control is inevitable (if control is not strengthened, it will be unable to compete for the world market and conquer neighboring colonies), even if the Seiyukai or Minseito party, which is "upholding the restoration of the constitution" today, forms a cabinet, it will have to take the path of the control system.

The number of seats in the Seiyukai has increased slightly. One reason for this is the resistance and struggle of local landlords against financial capitalists (most of the Seiyukai members come from various localities). Half of the seats lost by the Minseito party were due to the surge in people who distrusted political parties, and most people abstained from voting (this time, the number of abstainers is estimated to be 26.5% of the voters, which is unprecedented), and half were taken by the Social Masses Party. The leap forward of the Social Masses Party is due to the following reasons:

Under the "quasi-wartime system," prices are soaring, the real wages of the working masses are decreasing, and all that is infinitely strengthened is labor. At the same time, all political freedoms are about to be deprived. This is the first foundation for the leap forward of the Social Masses Party. Progressive intellectuals deeply hate the current social oppression, but at the same time they cannot engage in illegal activities, so the number of votes for the Social Masses Party has also increased a lot. In addition, there is a part of the declining small producers.

Those who voted for the Social Masses Party do not necessarily fully agree with the party's platform. To weaken the bourgeois parties and promote the opposition between the legal proletarian right-wing party (Social Masses Party) and the bourgeois parties (Seiyukai, Minseito, etc.)! In this sense, many people voted for the Social Masses Party.

After the general election, the Social Masses Party opened a "Gekkeikan" (Japanese sake name) and drank its winning wine.

The slogans of the Social Masses Party are: "Building a labor parliamentarian politics," "Carrying out domestic reforms," "Anti-capitalism"!… etc. But they dare not emphasize "Anti-fascism."

The Japanese Communist Party (legal left wing) most strongly emphasizes "Anti-fascism" and once advocated the "People's Front Movement," demanding merger with the Social Masses Party (the author has previously introduced this issue in this newspaper), and still insists on not abandoning this merger movement. However, the number of seats in the Japanese Communist Party did not increase this time. In fact, if the Japanese Communist Party is really a proletarian party, increasing the number of seats is not a very important issue. Moreover, if it can secure one or two seats, it should also help the Social Masses Party with the remaining votes and force the Social Masses Party to implement the political slogans of the Social Masses Party.

At a campaign speech meeting, Jiadeng appeared and advocated for the Japanese Communist Party, and the candidates of the Japanese Communist Party dared to attack the military and the fascist tendencies of some leaders of the Social Masses Party. This is also very meaningful. However, the reason why the "merger" of the two parties cannot be realized lies in this point.

Truly, the development of the Japanese Communist Party seems to be more possible only when the actions of the Social Masses Party contradict the words of the Social Masses Party. At present, forcing the Minseito and Seiyukai parties to strive for democratic freedom, forcing the Social Masses Party to practice slogans such as "anti-capitalism," and forcing the Social Masses Party to oppose fascism—this is not only one of the tactics of the Japanese Communist Party, but even progressive intellectuals have this kind of awareness, right?

From January to the present this year, the Japanese workers' struggle has recovered. Not only have the number of struggles and the number of people involved doubled, but the nature of the struggle has also undergone special changes. Demanding wage increases and recognition of collective bargaining rights is extremely common. The labor struggles in the military industry sector are the most numerous. This is also a result of the expansion of armaments. At the end of April, there were alliance strikes and strikes by streetcars and buses in Tokyo and Osaka. Each of these struggles is an answer to the "quasi-wartime system"! However, the expansion of the struggle is the driving force behind the leap forward of the proletarian faction.

Only on the standpoint of opposing the current cabinet can the Minseito, Seiyukai and anti-Social Masses Party have the possibility of cooperation. On the standpoint of maintaining bourgeois rule, the Minseito and Seiyukai have already jointly prevented the development of the Social Masses Party. The various fascist factions, on the one hand, are trying to unify the front, and on the other hand, are trying to win over certain elements of each party. However, since the Japanese constitution stipulates that soldiers are not allowed to interfere in politics and that active-duty soldiers are not allowed to join political parties, this provision has become a shackle on the political activities of the military today; therefore, the large-scale development of a unified fascist party is still very slim in the near future.

If the Hayashi Cabinet dissolves the parliament again, then the next election will definitely not break the status quo.

Under the current situation, sacrificing a Hayashi Cabinet is not a big deal in the eyes of financial capitalists, but it is necessary to prevent the development of the labor class political movement. Allowing the Social Masses Party to leap forward for a while is only because the Social Masses Party has a buffering effect between the labor and capital classes.

Look, the force that can break the status quo the most must be some major international event! May 5th.

### Seiyukai and Minseito Parties Resolve to Sacrifice Themselves for the Nation

Vowing to Overthrow the Hayashi Cabinet; Closer Liaison Between the Two Parties

[Tokyo] The Minseito Party's Provisional Executive Committee held a meeting at the party headquarters from 2:00 PM on the 15th. First, Secretary-General Koizumi reported on the situation of the talks between the secretaries-general of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, and decided that the two parties would unite to fight together to overthrow the Hayashi Cabinet. After listening to the report, the Executive Committee fully approved it. At the same time, with the awareness of sacrificing themselves for the country, they are determined not to succumb and decided to move towards overthrowing the cabinet. The Seiyukai-Minseito liaison aimed at overthrowing the Hayashi Cabinet is about to be realized. The secretaries-general of the two parties, Koizumi and Matsuno, have agreed on the 15th. The two parties have decided to hold the first representative committee of the two parties at the Imperial Hotel at 11:00 AM on the 19th to discuss the methods of implementing the overthrow of the cabinet, in order to strengthen the liaison between the two parties. The meeting will specially select members from the representative committee to be responsible for liaison between the two parties and various matters related to the implementation of the overthrow of the cabinet.

### Spain Experiences Another Political Upheaval; Current Cabinet Resigns

Socialist Party Rejects Anarchist Party; Current Prime Minister Ordered to Form Cabinet Again

◎Valencia After the resignation of Cabinet Prime Minister Gabariello, President Ariena immediately summoned leaders of various parties to seek their opinions, and as a result, ordered Gabariello to attempt to form a new cabinet. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 15th)

◎Valencia Regarding the resignation of Cabinet Prime Minister Gabariello, well-informed sources are willing to declare that the reasons are no more than two: 1. The anarchist faction in Barcelona, the capital of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, recently rioted; 2. The civil war has been prolonged, and the cabinet organization must be strengthened to cope with it. In addition, although the Socialist Party and the Communist Party recently resolved that the cabinet members belonging to their respective parties should withdraw from the cabinet, the anarchist National Confederation of Labor and the socialist General Confederation of Labor both advocated that Gabariello should form a cabinet again. Therefore, political figures expect that a new cabinet will be established quickly, and the number of cabinet members will be reduced compared to before. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 15th)

◎Popinan Eight hundred Spanish anarchists have occupied the Yisoda Fortress on the border city, preparing for a long-term resistance to the Valencia government. The government has dispatched a large army to suppress the rebellion. It is also reported that conflicts have occurred again in Barcelona, indicating that the anarchist party in Catalonia has not completely succumbed. (14th, National Dispatch)

◎Saragossa Although order has been restored in Barcelona, some rural towns are still in a state of terror. Leaders of the People's Front and government officials are often ambushed by rioters in some towns. (15th, National Maritime Telegraph)

### Spanish Rebel Army Launches Massive Bombing

More Than Sixty Aircraft Bomb the Entire Northern Front

◎Bilbao The Spanish Civil War will reach its tenth month next Wednesday. The Nationalist army began aerial bombardment on the northern front today, the fierceness of which has rarely been seen. More than sixty aircraft were bombing at the same time, with bombs raining down on the entire front, especially the coastal area near Mount Solubai. Enemy aircraft also frequently used machine guns to fire on various roads. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 14th)

### Britain and the United States Maintain Established Policies Towards China

Disagreement in the British Imperial Conference; United States Unwilling to Form a New Pacific Pact

[London] British officials believe that the concerns expressed in some Chinese newspapers about London's talks with Japan, which may lead to an understanding that endangers China's interests, are completely unfounded. As for the suggestion that Britain may agree to restore spheres of influence in China, it is also regarded as a joke. This is because such a move would undermine the entire trend of Britain's policy towards China after the declaration made by Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain in 1926 and after the British government's first economic adviser, Lees-Ross, was ordered to tour China last year. Moreover, the entire British people will never allow Britain to change its attitude towards China in this way. According to official sources, Britain will welcome an Anglo-Japanese understanding, but the basic point of Britain's position is the strict preservation of China's rights and interests. It is also recalled that on May 5th, Conservative Party Member of Parliament Morgan asked in the House of Commons whether the question of restoring spheres of influence in China could or should be raised when negotiating with countries related to the Far East on trade with China in order to seek a better understanding. At that time, Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the British government had not considered the restoration of spheres of influence in China. Such an answer is quite noteworthy. The reason why his answer was so brief is that, according to parliamentary rules, cabinet members' answers must be brief because time is limited and there are many questions from members of parliament. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 15th)

[Washington] Australian Prime Minister Lyons spoke at the British Imperial Conference yesterday, advocating that Pacific countries conclude a non-aggression treaty. Officials here today said that there was no need for this, believing that existing international treaties such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, if they could be observed unswervingly by the countries concerned, would be sufficient to maintain peace in the Pacific. As for guaranteeing the independence of the Philippines, it should be discussed separately. According to the Philippine Independence Act, the United States should be responsible for negotiating a permanent neutrality treaty for the Philippines with the countries concerned, but no concrete action has been taken on this matter. (14th, National News Agency Dispatch)

[London] The British Imperial Conference opened here yesterday. It is now learned that Canada, Australia, and South Africa will state frankly that each self-governing dominion is willing to avoid being drawn into the vortex of any war that may occur in Europe. Even if there is any action, it must be implemented after it has been decided by its independent free will. They will also propose establishing closer trade relations with the United States. The Times today published a dispatch from Washington, which is highly regarded. The dispatch quoted a speech by Hugh Wilson, president of the U.S. Foreign Policy Association, saying that the time has come for Britain to consider its commercial relations with the U.S. If it misses this opportunity again, the U.S. may fundamentally change its foreign policy. (15th, National Dispatch)

[London] When the Imperial Conference opened yesterday, Prime Minister Baldwin and the prime ministers of the various self-governing dominions successively delivered speeches. Observers generally believe that there are some conflicts of opinion between the British headquarters and the various self-governing dominions. The British government advocates that the problems discussed at this Imperial Conference should focus on foreign policy and imperial defense issues, but the representatives of the various self-governing dominions have decided that economic matters should be the main goal of this conference. If possible, the imperial economic agreements established at the Ottawa Conference in 1932 should be revised. This is the attitude expressed by Canadian Prime Minister King in his speech, which is quite similar to the proposal of U.S. President Roosevelt that peace should be based on international economic cooperation. Australian Federal Prime Minister Lyons advocated that the Pacific countries should conclude a non-aggression pact and frankly declared that cooperation among the Pacific countries is absolutely necessary. Therefore, Australia must cooperate with the United States, Japan, and other British self-governing dominions. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 15th)

### Germany's Policy Toward the United States Will Undergo Major Changes

To Be Carried Out After the New Ambassador Takes Office

[Washington] After the arrival of the new German Ambassador to the United States, Dieckhoff, it is expected that Germany's policy toward the United States will undergo new changes. According to diplomatic circles, when Ribbentrop succeeded Hesch as the German ambassador to the United Kingdom, Germany's policy toward the United Kingdom underwent major changes. Therefore, after Dieckhoff takes office, Germany's policy toward the United States may undergo similar major changes. The former Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Luther, will travel to California and various places in the East, and then return to Germany. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 15th)

### British King's Coronation Week Ends; Dignitaries From Various Countries Depart One After Another

London Diplomatic Talks Also Come to an End; Chamberlain Will Succeed Baldwin as Prime Minister

[London] The delegations from various countries participating in the British King's coronation ceremony have mostly made plans to return home due to the end of their mission. The Chinese delegation is still staying in London for ten days. French Foreign Minister Delbos left for Paris in the afternoon with members of the French delegation after attending a banquet hosted by British Foreign Secretary Eden. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov and Spanish General Marquez are scheduled to return home this afternoon. Spanish Envoy Pestero, Czech Prime Minister Hodza, Argentine Envoy Le Breton, Chilean General Arasena, Admiral Rodgers, and Uruguayan Envoy Herrera are all scheduled to return home tomorrow. Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt still intends to go to the countryside and spend a few days with friends. U.S. Envoy Gerard must stay until the middle of next month. German Defense Minister General Blomberg and Romanian Crown Prince Michael and his entourage must go to Spithead Harbor on the 21st to attend the British naval review before they can return home. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 15th)

[London] With the coronation ceremony of the King completed, Prime Minister Baldwin is about to retire, and Treasury Secretary Chamberlain will succeed him. Responsible sources have recently declared that, based on the diplomatic talks conducted by dignitaries from various countries here recently, it is known that when Chamberlain forms a cabinet in the future, he will still regard close cooperation between Britain and France as the main basis of the new cabinet's foreign policy. It is also known that Chamberlain has already discussed various current issues with dignitaries from various countries, especially French Foreign Minister Delbos, on behalf of the Prime Minister in the past week. In addition, dignitaries from various countries have conducted talks here and have obtained various results:

1. German Defense Minister General Blomberg has expressed his willingness to alleviate the situation caused by the Spanish Civil War and to continue negotiations on the West European Convention.

2. Britain still advises Germany to return to the League of Nations as its main goal, and is willing to consider returning Germany's former colonies if necessary, but only on the condition that Germany rejoins the collective security system and provides sufficient guarantees.

3. Czech Prime Minister Hodza expressed his unease about the increasing strengthening of the German-Italian axis during his talks with the authorities of the countries concerned. The countries concerned immediately declared that they were willing to maintain the country's independence and regard this as the main factor in guaranteeing European peace.

4. Yugoslavia still adheres to the alliance treaty established between the country and France, and all interpretations of the political and economic agreements between Italy and Yugoslavia that contradict this are not consistent with the facts. This has been confirmed by the spokesman of the Yugoslav delegation, but the Yugoslav government is not considering concluding a general mutual assistance treaty with its neighboring countries.

5. Britain and France will continue their efforts to organize the Danube River basin countries economically.

6. Regarding the Spanish Civil War, all parties are continuing their efforts to end it as soon as possible, and the starting point should be the withdrawal of all volunteer soldiers from various countries. The small organizational committee of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee will discuss it in the middle of next week.

7. It is rumored that Italy and Germany have already drafted a plan that, once the Spanish Nationalist army wins, they will establish an Iberian Empire and include Portugal in it. Portugal has therefore expressed indifference to Italy and Germany.

8. Regarding the question of whether the League of Nations should allow the representatives of Abyssinia to attend the League of Nations' temporary assembly at the end of today, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol is currently trying to resolve it, but has not yet achieved any results. However, based on the moderate speech made by Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano in the Italian Chamber of Deputies yesterday and the cordial hospitality of the German Embassy in London to the envoys of various countries, it is possible that Italy and Germany will adopt a compromise attitude.

### British Socialist Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden Passes Away

Advocated Peace During the European War; Benefited the People While in Office

[London] British prominent Labour Party leader and statesman Viscount Snowden passed away suddenly this morning at his home in Surrey due to a heart attack. Snowden was born in 1864 and was once a Labour Party member of the House of Commons. In 1893, he left his political career and engaged in journalism and lectured on socialism. In 1903, he returned to politics and served as chairman of the Independent Labour Party. From 1917 to 1920, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Labour Party government. In 1931, the Labour Party took office for the second time and served as an important minister. Leeds and other three universities awarded him honorary Doctor of Laws degrees. This is a general outline of Snowden's life and career. Snowden was a hero in the British Labour Party. If he had not suffered an accident in his early years, making his body weak, he would have been unmatched in British political socialism. Snowden had a clear mind, was full of political courage, and was good at debate, rich in emotion, and focused on humanitarianism. His sincere speech was able to make listeners forget their fatigue. Snowden was a firm believer in socialism and dedicated his entire life to promoting it. His father was a weaver. Due to poverty, he only attended elementary school. His lifelong learning came from self-study. Later, he took an examination at the tax office and obtained a humble position. After working hard for seven years, he was injured in the spine when he was hit by a bicycle while riding out one day, resulting in disability. During the months he spent recuperating, he studied social and economic problems and became a famous figure in the Socialist Party. Snowden served as a journalist and speaker for the Independent Labour Party, and at the request of the party, he gave speeches on the Labour Party platform. In less than two years, his political enemies were all defeated. In the winter of 1900, he ran for a seat in the House of Commons in Blackburn. Blackburn was a fortress of the government party. Snowden was poor, but he relied on his eloquence and won. As a result, he gained many comrades. Snowden served as a member of parliament for the district for more than ten years. In the 1913 election, he lost this seat like McConnachie because he advocated peace in the European War. It turned out that 3,000 relatives of families in Blackburn had died in the battlefield, so they hated Snowden's pacifism, causing those who had supported him in the past to abandon him and join other parties. However, Snowden strongly opposed communism and the Soviet Bolshevik Party, so he soon regained the support of the public. Mrs. Snowden also wrote two books recording her experiences in Russia after the war. The British labor's opposition to the Soviet regime was mostly due to the influence of these two books. When Snowden served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924, the budget he proposed was regarded as a masterpiece by both the government and the public in Britain. In essence, it was a liberal budget that reduced the food tax, which has long been a feature of the Labour Party's platform. During the general strike of 1926, Snowden, although a member of the Labour Party, strongly opposed it. In 1929, Snowden served as the British representative at the Hague Conference, and always fought for British taxpayers. As a result, Snowden was admired by all walks of life throughout the country, and even the world was full of admiration. Snowden's speeches in the House of Commons were always moving to the audience, and even Lloyd George, who was famous for his eloquence, praised him endlessly. Mrs. Snowden was also known for her virtue. She was a great help to Snowden in his daily life and devoted her spare time to social reform. Therefore, all those who knew the Snowdens admired this couple. Snowden's lifelong doctrine was to rectify industry and society, eliminate the people's distress and poverty, and build human happiness. Snowden was tireless in this doctrine until his death. Britain's abolition of the gold standard was successfully achieved through a proposal put forward by Mr. Snowden while he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Today, when Snowden passed away, his wife was not by his side because she went to London to attend a ball at Buckingham Palace. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 15th)

### Grand Ball Held in British Royal Palace

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden hosted a formal banquet last night at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to honor the British King and Queen. The King sat between Mrs. Eden and Princess Royal. Guests included Chinese Envoy Kong Xiangxi and Deputy Envoy Chen Shaokuan. After the banquet, the British King and Queen held the first formal ball after the coronation at Buckingham Palace, starting at 11 p.m. About 2,000 guests danced, and the scene was colorful, brilliant, and dazzling. The King and Queen started the dance, and the Queen Mother and other members of the royal family were led into the venue by the Lord Chamberlain. Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, Miss Kong, Mr. and Mrs. Zhu Changnian, and the son of Chairman Chiang were all invited to attend the meeting. When the royal family members went to the supper after midnight, Envoy Kong and the Duchess of Norfolk led the way. Tens of thousands of people gathered outside the palace to watch the distinguished guests. The crowds waited for several hours. The King and Queen appeared on the palace corridor after midnight and waved to the crowd for five minutes. The crowd cheered so enthusiastically. It only stopped when the King and Queen retreated.

### Certain Party in Tianjin Acquires Over Ten Thousand Mu of Land

Using the Name of Perpetual Lease to Acquire at High Prices; Tianjin County Magistrate Accused of Stealing and Selling National Land

Tianjin Communication: A certain party has been continuously acquiring land in the four suburban areas of Tianjin under the name of "perpetual lease" for the past two years, with a total of over ten thousand mu. The most recent transactions are mostly in villages on both sides of the Hai River and in southern Tianjin. Because land that was originally worth only a few dozen yuan per mu, the certain party offered a huge price of six to seven hundred yuan. Ignorant villagers not only happily sold it off, but also scrambled for it. Han traitors and gangsters took advantage of it as a source of profit, inciting and persuading, or investigating or negotiating prices on their behalf. Although the Tianjin Municipal Government has strictly cracked down, it is still not easy to achieve absolute results. Unexpectedly, this matter has become more and more strange. Someone has even accused Chen Zhongyue, the magistrate of Tianjin County, of colluding with clerks to steal and sell national land. The truth of this matter has not yet been determined, but the locations pointed out by the accuser are indeed "perpetually leased" by the certain party. The representatives of the people in the southern township of Tianjin County, including Jian Du'an, Zheng Le, Yang Xuexin, Yang Zhaoqing, Sun Huaichen, and Zhu Weichang, filed a complaint with various agencies accusing Chen Zhongyue, the magistrate of Tianjin County, of colluding with clerks to steal and sell national land. The facts of the accusation are divided into four points: 1. Magistrate Chen colluded with clerks and local bullies to sell all official land and civilian property to foreigners. In recent months, more than 10,000 mu of land have been transacted, including 5,000 mu in Louzhuangzi, more than 4,000 mu in Balitai, and more than 1,400 mu north of Xikai. Some of the land was bought from Liyun Company, Gongyi Hall, Qi Family, Deng Family, and Enqing Company. Rongye Company and Dongfeng Company are still in progress. 2. Magistrate Chen and clerks such as Zhang Junwen are buying land on behalf of a certain foreign company. The names of the sellers are Zhang Huaxuan of Liyun Company, Ma Jinting of Gongyi Hall, Qi Yaoshan of Yiliantang, Enqing Company, China Industrial Bank, Zhang Guoti of National Livelihood School, Tongshantang, former Prime Minister Zhang Shaoceng, Han Family of Chongdaotang, Deng Ruzhuo Qingji, He Qingcheng, Rongye Company, etc. The land is all in the Wujia Yao and Balitai areas. 3. Chen and Zhang are buying land for a certain foreign company and have signed a contract for a period of six months to buy more than 5,000 mu, with penalties. 4. Magistrate Chen introduced Lu Zhaoji, director of the official property office in the urban area, to Zhang to privately issue official property licenses. Also, thousands of mu of land in Louzhuangzi were bought by a certain person at a low price through the lobbying of Magistrate Chen and Director Lu, and then resold to foreigners, making a profit of more than 300,000 yuan. The three of them colluded to share the spoils. Because this matter involves a wide range of people, it has attracted the attention of various levels of agencies. The Hebei Supervisory Envoy's Office has also sent people to secretly investigate. According to investigations, the land mentioned above was indeed transacted in March and April of this year, but it cannot be determined whether the points pointed out by the accuser are true. According to Magistrate Chen, most of the land mentioned above is in the urban area of Tianjin, not in the Tianjin County area. Even if it is bought by foreigners, it is beyond the authority of the county government. Their reckless exposure is obviously a slander and is not worth refuting. The truth will eventually be revealed.

The Tianjin County Government arrested Zhang Huaxuan (50 years old), a criminal who stole and sold national land, at the Huizhong Hotel in the French Concession on the evening of the 8th. Zhang is a civil servant of a certain agency, and many people are involved in the same case. After a thorough investigation by the county government, a lot of evidence was obtained. Zhang has been sent to the Tianjin Security Command for interrogation. Recently, the Tianjin Municipal Government has secretly sold real estate to foreigners under the name of individuals, or used the names of Chinese people as a disguise. On the 12th, it reiterated the ban and ordered the Finance Bureau's Tax Deed Office to add the words "Foreigners impersonating Chinese names, hall names, or other names, mortgages and sales of real estate are invalid" to the cover of the deed to prevent this.

### Planning to Build Railways in Guizhou Province

Neighboring Provinces Shipping Salt to Guizhou to Have Additional Salt Tax Levied to Fund Railway Construction in Guizhou Province

A communication from Guilin states that the Guizhou provincial authorities, with regards to transportation construction, besides highways, plan to build railways within Guizhou Province. However, the project is vast, and Guizhou Province's financial resources are limited, fearing they cannot succeed. The chairman of the provincial government, Huang Xuchu, has specially proposed a method for raising funds, imitating Guangdong Province's additional salt tax to issue public bonds for the construction of the Guangmei Railway. He suggests that the salt shipped from neighboring provinces to Guizhou be taxed by the Guizhou salt affairs authorities. The tax revenue obtained will be deposited in the bank as a fund for road construction. Yesterday, this opinion was telegraphed to both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways. The telegram stated: "Upon investigation, Guizhou Province's edible salt bears the burden of both Guangdong and Guizhou taxes, coupled with inconvenient transportation and high freight costs. In remote counties, every hundred market dan costs as much as 20 yuan in legal currency. Commentators believe that the flaws in China's salt law and the unequal burden are unprecedented in other countries. In recent years, the central government has already considered this and has proposed a new salt law, but it has not been implemented, and the people in remote areas are already full of complaints. Recently, the Ministry of Finance sent Inspector-General Zeng Yangfeng and Director Tang Xuan to Guizhou to inspect. Merchants and people in this province have petitioned Mr. Tang and Mr. Zeng, requesting ways to reduce the burden, which shows where public opinion lies. Mr. Zeng and Mr. Tang have graciously agreed to submit it to the Ministry for approval and implement the border subsidy method to reduce the burden on the people of Guizhou. If, on the one hand, taxes are increased and, on the other hand, subsidies are provided, the resulting burden will be the same, and it is feared that the people will mock the government for being fickle. This is the first point. Guangdong has always been known to be wealthy, and its railway lines are increasing day by day. Guangxi has always been known to be poor, and its transportation is inconvenient, and there is not even half an inch of railway lines. Using the additional salt tax as a fund for Guangdong Province to issue Guangmei Railway public bonds has not been mentioned at all in Guizhou Province. Although the railway is not solely for the benefit of one province, the people's knowledge is limited, and ordering them to bear an additional burden may not be explained to them with simple reasons. This is the second point. It is believed that since the attitude of increasing taxes cannot be changed now, it should be requested that the salt shipped to Guizhou be collected by the Guangxi salt affairs authorities. The additional tax revenue collected by the Guangxi salt affairs authorities will be kept in the Central Bank for the purpose of issuing public bonds for future railway construction in Guangxi Province or the Ministry of Finance can plan to build the Yongqin and Hewu lines within Guangxi Province and appropriate the salt tax collected by the Guangxi salt affairs authorities. In this way, there is no change to the original tax increase plan, and the burden on the people of Guangxi has a sufficient reason to be explained. Inspector-General Zeng and Director Tang also agreed with this opinion very much when they came to Guizhou. It is specially attached for your review and instruction." (May 10th)

### Yu Xi Disaster Victims Go to Jiangxi to Reclaim Wasteland

More Than 20,000 People to Depart This Month

A communication from Zhengzhou states that the drought in the counties of western Henan is severe, with the land parched for miles, and the people are in despair. Local people have repeatedly appealed to all parties for disaster relief, but it is like a drop in the bucket, difficult to be universally effective. This spring, local gentry suggested relocating disaster victims to other provinces to reclaim wasteland as an emergency measure. Zhang Fang, Wang Guangqing, and others contacted the Jiangxi provincial authorities, who expressed a warm welcome to the proposal, as the province had wide expanses of land and a sparse population after the bandit disasters. Li Jingshan and other representatives of the people of Mianchi County also submitted a petition to the Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, advocating the relocation of people to relieve the disaster, which has been approved by the committee to go to Jiangxi for reclamation. Disaster victims from neighboring counties such as Luoning, Yiyang, and Xin'an are also willing to go. According to an investigation by Li Jingshan and others, more than 20,000 disaster victims in the four counties are determined to relocate to Jiangxi for reclamation. Immigration procedures are currently being processed. It is expected that Li and others will lead them to Bian this month, first to petition the provincial authorities for travel expenses and negotiate for transportation, so as to go south.

### Suzhou

Request to Reduce Import Duties on Artificial Silk

The Wuxian Gauze and Satin Trade Association (i.e., Yunjin Guild), in view of the fact that the tariff on artificial silk and artificial silk fabrics differs by more than two times, foreign merchants ship artificial silk fabrics to China for dumping, making it difficult to sell domestic silk and satin, and the silk industry is facing its demise. Although the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Machine Weaving Association has repeatedly submitted petitions to the Ministry, requesting the revision of the import duties on artificial silk, it has not been approved. It has sent a letter to the Shanghai Silk Trade Association, requesting the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Machine Weaving Association to send representatives to the Ministry of Finance to petition, and strive to achieve the goal of changing the import duty rate on artificial silk to ad valorem collection. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Machine Weaving Association has now scheduled to convene an emergency meeting of representatives of the same industry from various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang on the 18th of this month. The Wuxian Gauze and Satin Industry and the Iron Machine Silk Weaving Industry will send representatives She Wenqing and others to Shanghai to attend the meeting and discuss how to proceed.

Organize a Commercial Arbitration Office

In order to mediate commercial disputes, the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce initiated the organization of a commercial arbitration office, named the Wuxian Commercial Arbitration Office, drafted the articles of association, and submitted them to the Construction Department for record. Subsequently, it received an order from the Department to correct the name to the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce Commercial Arbitration Office. In order to establish the arbitration office as soon as possible, the County Chamber of Commerce held a meeting on the 15th to discuss it. It was resolved to send letters to various industries to investigate the names of representatives from each industry, so as to compile a roster, and then schedule a general meeting of members to elect the director and councilors of the arbitration office, in order to establish it.

### Changshu

Supervision Office Secretly Investigates Bribery Case

Sun Kangkui, a wealthy opium smoker outside the East Gate, was ordered to quit opium use and had no license. After being detained by the county, he asked someone to help him exchange his brother, Kangtai, and send him to the hospital for inspection. It was found that he had no drug addiction. It was rumored that the Sun family bribed a large sum of money to achieve this result. Wang Zaiming was sent by the Wuxi Special Commissioner's Office to Changshu to investigate. The Sun family did not deny it, and there were villagers who testified to the exchange. He immediately returned to Wuxi to report. Now, the Supervisory Envoy's Office has sent Chen Kan to Changshu to secretly investigate. The situation obtained is similar to that of the previous committee member Wang, but the county government admitted that "the detention was wrong," which may be possible, but "the exchange" was not acknowledged.

Banana Tree Blossoms

A banana tree planted in the home of Yin Shouyi (who works at the Hankou Railway Bureau) in Xiu'an Alley has been around for four or five years. Recently, a huge flower has suddenly bloomed at the top of the tree, yellow and slightly green in color, with thick petals, similar in shape to a lotus flower, and extremely bright. In each petal, there is a bundle of pistils. It is still budding and not fully opened. Experts say that this is the Qionghua flower, which is extremely precious.

### Wuxi

Giant Python Discovered in Xihe Bridge

Jiang Songwei, a resident of No. 33 Xihe Bridge in the city, recently discovered that a pet civet cat had gone missing one after another. He searched everywhere but could not find it, and felt very strange. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a maid was washing dishes in the kitchen and faintly heard a roar from the firewood room. She went to open the door to check and was shocked to see a giant python lying on the ground, about two zhang long, with bright eyes and an open mouth, looking terrifying. The maid was terrified and screamed, reporting to the owner, who immediately called the snake catcher Fu Debiao to capture the giant python and release it into the river at Deda Bridge in the west gate.

Raise Funds to Widen Streets and Demolish the City

Zhang Fulin, the director of the County Construction Bureau, previously drafted the central work plan for the 26th year, with widening the streets from the North City Gate to Fuxing Road and demolishing the North Yue City as the main tasks. He had drafted the budget and other items. It is now learned that the project has been approved by the Construction Department, but due to a lack of funds, it has been decided to add 100 rickshaws, each with a deposit of 150 yuan, totaling 15,000 yuan. The deposit has been collected and is intended to be used for widening the street from the North City Gate to Lianrong Bridge. It is scheduled to convene the twelfth construction meeting at the County Government tomorrow (the 17th) to discuss it, so as to start construction as soon as possible.

Silk Cocoon Requires Ten Million in Funds

The silkworms in Wuxi are developing very smoothly recently due to the sunny weather. The mulberry leaves are also thriving. The large batches have reached the first molt, and the late batches are also starting to bud. It is estimated that the new cocoons can be on the market between the 27th and 28th of this month. According to a recent survey, there are only about 10,000 dan of dried cocoons stored in the whole county. Before the new cocoons are available, they can all be reeled. Silk cocoon merchants are now contacting various banks and money houses to raise funds to purchase fresh cocoons. The amount of funds used last year was 8 million yuan, of which 6 million yuan was used within the Yongtai range, and the remaining cocoon merchants used 1 million yuan. This year, there are more new cocoons, and the amount of funds used will have to be increased to about 10 million yuan. The China Communications Bank of Jiangsu provides the most loans, followed by farmers.

### Zhenjiang

Temporary Market Completed

The project to widen West Gate Avenue and rebuild Daxi Road in Zhenjiang is progressing actively. All the houses on both sides were notified at the end of March to be demolished within 40 days. The deadline is on the 4th of this month. However, due to the difficulty of finding new locations, some shops have not been able to demolish on schedule. In order to actively carry out the construction work, the Municipal Construction Engineering Office has strictly limited the households that have not yet demolished to demolish by the 20th of this month. If the deadline is exceeded, workers will be hired to demolish on their behalf, with materials used to pay for the labor. In addition, the temporary market building by the river has already started construction, with a total of more than 300 rooms, which have also been leased out. As the deadline for demolishing the houses is approaching, the contractor has been ordered to rush the work day and night. All the houses can be completed by the 15th of this month. At the same time, various shops can begin to move in and do business.

### Yangzhou

Yesterday, it was decided to build a Zhongzheng Pavilion near the Xiaoyan Yulou and Cang Sheng Temple in Nanhu, following the principles stipulated by the provincial capital, to commemorate it forever, and it has been submitted to the province for record. Lu Chujue, Zhang Xinfu, and Zhu Yisheng have been appointed to be responsible for the design and construction.

### Xiaoshan

Gamblers Gather to Resist Arrest

Gambling is rampant in Xiaoshan, and the streets and alleys are full of houses that draw commissions and gather people to gamble. In the countryside, private Baeksinbo gambling dens and commission-drawing gambling are everywhere. In Linpu Town, at the junction of Shaoshao, there were gamblers wildly playing Baeksinbo. The director of the Public Security Bureau ordered the patrol police and detectives to rush to arrest them. Unexpectedly, the gamblers relied on their numbers and gathered to resist arrest, taking away two wooden-cased guns from the detectives. Fortunately, the police were brave and captured two gamblers on the spot.

### Ningbo

Fishing Boat Tragically Capsizes

He Hengsheng, Xu Alin, Lu Aquan, Wang Achun of Yin County, Shen Jinfu of Dinghai, Xin Quanlin of Zhenhai, and others make a living by fishing. Recently, the fishing season in Taohua Yang is booming, so they hired three to five crew members each, drove six large fishing boats, and sailed to catch fish. On the 12th, they were fully loaded with fish and planned to return to Ningbo for sale. Unfortunately, when they sailed to the Lichang Yang area of Zhenhai, they suddenly encountered a heavy thunderstorm. The sails of three boats, He Hengsheng, Lu Aquan, and Xu Alin, were broken, and they capsized. Three boat owners and five crew members, including Gu Ruchun and Wang Xiaoshan, drowned. Fortunately, the remaining crew members were rescued. The loss of boats and goods is more than 10,000 yuan.

### Huaiyin

Large Number of Bandits Captured

Teng Shaozhou, the captain of the Honghu Water Police Team, recently received a tip that remnants of bandits suddenly sneaked into Shunhe Town, Laozishan Township, which belongs to the county, on the 7th with the intention of causing trouble. He immediately mobilized his troops to rush to suppress them. Unfortunately, the area is located at the junction of Jiangsu and Anhui, and is backed by mountains and bordering the lake. The troops were insufficient to control the situation. In addition to blocking the bandits' retreat, he also urgently telegraphed the 7th Security Command of Jiangsu Province to send a team to assist. After Li, the deputy commander, transferred a team to join the encirclement and suppression, the bandits were defeated on the 9th and 36 were captured. Dozens of bandit guns were seized. On the 11th, the bandits were escorted to the city and sent to the command for legal action.

### National Goods Maintenance Association Telegraphs Request to Reject Japanese Demand for Lowering Tariffs

The China National Goods Maintenance Association yesterday telegraphed to Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan, Kong, Minister of Finance, Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Wu, Minister of Industry, in Nanjing, stating: "We read in the Shanghai newspapers of May 11th a report on the Japanese Three Ministers Conference, which stated that the policy towards China is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit in order to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, but at the same time, it is proposed to demand that China reduce the tariffs levied on Japanese goods. Upon investigation, Japan imposes particularly heavy taxes on imports from China and has not been heard to have reduced them slightly. However, it demands that China reduce import duties on Japanese goods, which is self-contradictory. What is equality? What is mutual benefit? Moreover, our country levies import duties on goods regardless of nationality and treats them equally. How can it unilaterally grant the right to reduce taxes on Japanese goods? The association feels that this is dangerous, and for the sake of preventing problems, we specially telegraph to your departments, asking you to pay attention. If the other country really has this proposal, we urge you to resolutely reject it, so as to protect national sovereignty and maintain the people's livelihood." The telegram is extremely urgent. Wang Jie'an, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, Standing Committee Members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association.

### Foreigners Also Pay Income Tax

Shanghai Office Thanks He Dekui for Promoting Tax Payment by Chinese Staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council

The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to He Dekui yesterday, thanking him for his advocacy of income tax payment by Chinese staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Settlement, which has been enthusiastically supported. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Dear Sir, After reading the newspaper yesterday, we learned that you have advocated that your Chinese staff voluntarily pay income tax. Upon hearing this, we were filled with admiration. The income tax system has not been established for long, yet it has been promoted nationwide and achieved great results. This is not only due to the government's efforts, but also to the support of the entire people, especially the leading role played by the intellectual class. In this city, for several months, not only Chinese personnel working under foreign firms have voluntarily declared and paid taxes, but also foreign personnel have voluntarily paid taxes. Among them, Russian, German, and Turkish personnel are not to be mentioned, but also Japanese and British residents are not uncommon. All these phenomena prove that the income tax has been fully supported by international morality. Now that you, as a leader, have raised your voice, it is a model for Chinese staff serving in foreign institutions. This move has a small impact on tax revenue, but a great impact on the meaning of self-reliance for Chinese nationals. We are very grateful. According to today's newspaper, the Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Taxpayers Association, etc., have all sent letters to you, expressing their deep admiration, which shows that people share the same feelings and principles, and it is not only the responsibility of this office to promote the new tax. However, we are eager to know the current situation. We are sending you two copies each of the Implementation Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and the Collection Instructions, along with two copies each of the reporting form and the withholding list. We hope you will check them. If there is anything you do not understand, please feel free to ask, and we will provide detailed answers at any time."

### Jin Cheng Bank Celebrated its 20th Anniversary Yesterday Morning with a Commemorative Ceremony

Held a Shareholders' Meeting in the Afternoon and a Banquet for All Sectors in the Evening

Jin Cheng Bank held its 20th anniversary commemorative ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday at No. 1100 Jiangxi Road. Guests attending included Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Song Hanzhang, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Xu Shiying (represented by Huang Bode), Huang Zhuotang, Song Ziliang, Chen Xing, Cai Lejun, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Cai Zengji, Lin Kanghou, Luo Qinghua, Quan Runxiang, Mei Lifang, as well as directors and supervisors of the bank, Ren Zencai, Ning Caixuan, Wu Dingchang, Qian Xinzhi, Ni Youdan, Hu Bijang, Fan Xudong, and over a thousand others.

Chairman's Report

After the ceremonial procedures, Chairman and General Manager Zhou Zuomin first gave a report, saying: "The economic environment in which the bank has been operating and the general situation of the bank's business over the years have been compiled into a commemorative publication and distributed to our shareholders and those in the community who care about our bank. Please take a look and give us your guidance. Now, let me summarize the main points and report to you: ㊀ The bank was established in 1917. The founders were Wang Zhusan, Ni Youdan, Qu Lier, Duan Guxiang, Guo Shantang, Ren Zencai, Wu Daquan, Chen Xinglou, Xu Youzheng, Hu Bijang, and myself. Today, those present are Ni, Ren, Wu, Hu, Qu, and myself. Chen is in Peiping. With utmost sincerity and respect, we commemorate the wisdom and hard work of the deceased founders Wang, Duan, Guo, and Xu. ㊁ When the bank was founded, the capital was only 500,000 yuan, and deposits were only 4,610,000 yuan. Now, the total capital reserve has reached 10,670,000 yuan, and the total amount of deposits, including both commercial and savings departments, has reached more than 170 million yuan. During these 20 years, the economic situation in our country has been tumultuous and has undergone numerous changes. The financial industry, facing this environment, has had to cope with and struggle with difficulties that are almost unimaginable and incomparable in theory, precedent, or common sense. The fact that the bank has been able to gradually advance its business during this period is all due to the care of our shareholders and people in the community, the guidance of the directors and supervisors, and the cooperation of our colleagues. We are deeply grateful. ㊂ The bank's business policy over the years has been to follow a fixed principle, but the specific implementation of its methods has varied depending on the period and region. This is detailed in the commemorative publication, so I will not repeat it here. Currently, the bank has 60 branches and more than 20 warehouses, with over 700 employees. The foundation of our credit has been established, and the scope of our services is expanding daily. We should adhere to the original purpose of our establishment, focus on deposits, strive for safety, benefits, and convenience. For loans, we should strive for solidity, elasticity, and public welfare in their realization, to live up to the trust of our shareholders and customers, and to assist in the progress of economic construction. This is a brief summary report, and I hope that you will not hesitate to offer your advice and guidance, so that we can improve our service." Next, Supervisor Wu Dingchang gave a speech (omitted).

Speeches by Yu and Others

Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun, He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Xu Kan, Wang Xiaolai, and others gave speeches in succession, the gist of which was: "China is subject to external economic influences and internal disasters. The countryside is collapsing, and the money market is extremely tight. Jin Cheng Bank was founded in 1917 by Mr. Zhou Zuomin and others. Initially, the scale was small, but through the efforts of the directors, the capital has increased from 2 million to 10 million yuan, creating strategies for the country and benefiting the people. Now that the country is in the midst of economic construction, we hope that your bank will continue to strive and move forward." Then, Chairman Zhou Zuomin gave a thank-you speech. At 12:00 PM, tea and refreshments were served and a group photo was taken.

Shareholders' Meeting

At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the shareholders' meeting continued at the head office on Jiangxi Road. A total of 21,389 shares were present. Zhou Zuomin presided over the meeting, first reporting on the purpose of the meeting and the business situation of the previous year. Then, the profit distribution proposal was discussed, and directors were re-elected. As a result, Ren Zencai, Ning Caixuan, Wu Daquan, Qian Xinzhi, and Ni Youdan were re-elected as before. Hu Bijang and Fan Xudong were appointed as supervisors. Zhou Zuomin was re-elected as chairman and general manager. At 7:00 PM in the evening, a banquet was held at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road, with over 100 colleagues from the bank's head office and branches participating, as well as inviting over 500 celebrities from all walks of life to the banquet. Performances were given at the time to add to the enjoyment.

### Fish Market Vendors Struck Yesterday

Demanding the Cancellation of Brokerage Fees; Market Held Emergency Meeting to Discuss Response; Resumed Operations This Morning Upon Du's Persuasion, According to Central News Agency

Shanghai Fish Market vendors in the Industry Department, in order to demand that fish market brokers cancel the 1.5% commission fee, failed to reach their goal, and suddenly went on strike yesterday morning. Dozens of fish vendors gathered near Dinghai Bridge, each holding two incense sticks, preventing fish vendor trucks from passing. Along the way in the areas of Waihongqiao, Tilanqiao, and Yangshupu Water Plant, people were engaged in propaganda, resulting in blocked market traffic. Market staff had to show their staff certificates to be allowed to pass. General peddlers then retreated, so the market was virtually paralyzed, until the above situation was learned. The police station and patrol room were telephoned to send police to suppress the situation, but it was already late. Although a few fish vendors arrived at the market afterwards, business was light, reaching only sixty or seventy loads.

Market Response

Market General Manager Wang Xiaolai, Deputy Manager Zhu Kaiguan, and Sun Guchen invited Standing Directors Du Yuezhu, Kui Yanfang, Fang Jiaobo, Tang Chengzong, and Supervisor Qian Xinzhi to an emergency meeting at the Central Bank Building on the second floor at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Wang reported on the incident, and it was decided that since the matter concerned the request to cancel brokerage fees, brokers must be consulted and a report submitted to the ministry for approval. Therefore, the fish vendors were earnestly advised not to use strikes as a threat, and to resume operations immediately and await discussion and resolution. The situation was also reported to the Ministry of Industry by telegram.

Wang's Remarks

According to Wang after the meeting, the 1.5% brokerage fee was submitted to the Ministry for approval and determination. Although fish vendors had expressed a request for cancellation, they did not make a clear request. Today's sudden strike, in the form of coercion, is not a proper means. Now, after earnest advice and guidance, it is expected that operations can be resumed tomorrow morning. According to another source, although there have often been disputes over brokers collecting fees exceeding the fixed amount, they have still coexisted peacefully for a year. Generally, small fish vendors do not dare to express themselves clearly. This strike was instigated by several large fish vendors, some of whom may have had other motives. It is reported that fish vendors held a meeting at the Triangle Vegetable Market on North Henan Road yesterday afternoon.

Impact on Fish Prices

Recently, it has been the season for large yellow croaker, and more goods arrived yesterday. Due to the suspension of operations, although the market was affected, fish merchants suffered direct losses. Therefore, representatives of the bucket fresh industry Xin Fanseng, the fishing transport industry Xu Wusun, and representatives of the eight gang fishermen Xu Yifei, Ge Liquan, Hu Zhizhai, Lin Meiqing, Shi Jihua, etc., went to the Central Bank to request the board of directors to purchase yesterday's fish cargo from the market to avoid losses for merchants. Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, etc., explained that the strike was sudden, and the market also suffered losses, so fish merchants could only bear the losses for one day and were earnestly advised to resume operations. If there is another strike tomorrow, then a solution will be sought. It is reported that yesterday's fish cargo arriving in Shanghai included 165 buckets of fresh fish, thousands of loads of fishing transport, and a total of ten boats from the eight gang fishermen, with a total value of over 40,000 yuan. The opening price reached 8 yuan per load, but later fell to 6.5 yuan, with only sporadic transactions.

Resumption of Operations This Morning

Shanghai Times Agency reports that over 300 fish market vendors in Shanghai went to the residence of Du Yuesheng, the standing director of the market, at 7:45 PM last night to petition, demanding the cancellation of brokerage fees. Six representatives were selected to meet with Du and present their intentions. Du said that this matter requires the fish vendors to first unconditionally resume operations before it can be discussed at length, otherwise it cannot be resolved. The representatives agreed with Du's opinion, so they expressed their acceptance on the spot and agreed to resume operations as usual this morning.

### Shanghai Municipal Bank Accountant Admits to Temporary Misappropriation

Hu Zhide Embezzles Large Sums

Hu Zhide, a Ningbo native and staff member of the accounting department of the Shanghai Municipal Bank's head office, successively embezzled more than 47,000 yuan from the bank due to speculative business ventures. This was discovered by accounting director Li Yangyuan. Since Hu was guilty of embezzling a huge amount of public funds, he reported it to President Zhu Dagao, reported it to the police and sent it to the Supervisory Office of the District Court. Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang investigated and clarified the case and filed a public prosecution. The case was heard by Judge Wu Xiangzu yesterday afternoon. The bank hired a lawyer to file an ancillary civil lawsuit, requesting a judgment ordering repayment. When questioned, the defendant Hu Zhide admitted to using his position to continuously misappropriate public funds. Initially, the purpose was temporary misappropriation, but later, because the amount was too large, he was unable to repay it and sought forgiveness. The court concluded the debate and adjourned to await judgment.

### City Federation Held Representative Congress Yesterday

Passed Declaration and Elected Executive and Supervisory Committee Members

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation convened its sixth first representative congress at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, third floor.  Over a hundred people attended, including representatives from various district branches, city party representatives Wang Yucheng, and Social Affairs Bureau representative Lei Kenan.  The presidium consisted of Lin Kanghou, Zhang Yichen, Wang Manyun, Chen Jicheng, Cao Zhigong, Ye Jiaxing, and Li Aokui. Zhu Yutao served as secretary, Zheng Dongshan as master of ceremonies, and Liang Gengshun and Zhao Ziyun as recorders.  The congress passed a declaration and proposals, and re-elected the executive and supervisory committee members. Details are as follows:

Chairman's Speech

After the ceremonial formalities, Chairman Lin Kanghou gave the opening address, stating that party and government representatives and all representatives trace the organization's origins to the amalgamation of various road business federations in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], and it has now reached its sixth session.  During these years, the domestic and international economic panic occurred, and this city suffered the unprecedented "January 28th Incident," leading to market depression and industrial and commercial difficulties reaching their peak.  This federation, entrusted with the heavy responsibility by the citizens, witnessed the difficulties of the times and ran around appealing, not daring to slacken in the slightest.  However, due to the accumulation of problems, the results achieved were limited.  At the same time, during these years, the Public Works Department, which relied on taxpayers for its survival, and the public utility organs under its supervision, disregarded the environment and implemented many unreasonable measures, such as successive price increases for telephones and tap water. The Public Works Department has also decided to increase the municipal general tax starting from January 1st of next year. Matters such as the recovery of road jurisdiction in areas beyond the settlement boundaries, and the protection of the livelihood of poor citizens, all require our continued efforts to correct or maintain them.  Recalling the fifth representative congress of this federation, a declaration was issued, outlining five key aspects of the federation's work policy: ㊀ Strengthening the organization and enhancing its power; ㊁ Striving for equal political rights; ㊂ Conducting Western rights training for citizens and cultivating the foundation for local autonomy; ㊃ Promoting domestic goods and developing the national economy; ㊄ Improving public utilities to increase public welfare. All of these remain principles that we should adhere to and strive to thoroughly implement in the future.  It is hoped that the party and government bureaus will provide guidance from time to time, and that people from all walks of life will not hesitate to supervise and urge us forward, which is what we deeply hope for.  The representatives from the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau then delivered instructions, and Standing Committee member Zhang Yi'ao reported on the federation's work. Details of the speeches are omitted.

Discussion of Proposals

The discussion of proposals then began: ㊀ The Supervisory Committee requested the passage of the organizational rules of the Supervisory Committee. Resolution: Reserved. ㊁ Representatives Zhang Yi'ao, Cao Zhigong, and Liu Zhongying proposed that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession's increase in the municipal general tax was unilaterally decided by Western taxpayers and will be implemented from January 1st of next year.  Continued efforts should be made to achieve the goal of its cancellation. Resolution: Handed over to the Executive Committee for handling. ㊂ Representatives Liu Zhongying, Cao Zhigong, Li Aokui, and Zhang Yi'ao proposed that this city, as the center of the national economy and industry, is currently rife with private leases, and the resulting impact on the national economy is alarming and could lead to bankruptcy. This should be resolutely stopped.

Congress Declaration

It is no coincidence that this meeting is held in the middle of May, the month with the most national humiliation anniversaries. There is a deeper meaning. The Citizen's Federation inherits from the Road Business Federation, and the Business Federation originated from the June 3rd Movement after the May Fourth Movement in the fourth year of the Republic [1915]. Its support for the revolution, its actions of not sending representatives and not paying taxes, its orderly strike of a full month during the May 3rd Massacre, and its historical achievements in the national revival can inspire patriotic people and make imperialists retreat. Recalling the past, examining ourselves, and looking to the future, the colleagues of this federation deeply feel that our responsibility is great. We should consolidate the unity of "fraternity and sincerity" and act as the front line of "national revival." Daring to base ourselves on this principle, we plan to carry out the following in this session: ㊀ Increasing Strength: "A single arrow is easily broken, but many arrows are difficult to break" is a basic principle of physics. Our Citizen's Federation has not yet fully integrated all citizens within the district into one body, so our strength is still insufficient. In this session, we should open the doors widely and incorporate all citizens within the district into one, so that the strength of this federation will increase to be as strong as iron, as soft as water, as tough as elephant skin, and as solid as compacted earth, so that there is a sense of making it easy to shake Mount Tai, but difficult to shake Yue Fei's army. ㊁ Reviving the Economy: The prosperity or decline of the citizens' economy has many causes, but the quality of municipal facilities is the most important cause. Let us ask whether the municipal facilities in this district promote the prosperity or decline of the citizens' economy. Land prices fall, but valuations are not reduced; rents are reduced, but assessed rents are increased. The authorities still live in comfort and luxury, ignoring the commercial and residential difficulties of the citizens and ignoring the displacement of the citizens. Moreover, it even intensifies these problems. This kind of policy implementation should be strongly corrected to benefit the revival of the citizens' economy. ㊂ Improving Housing: Improving housing is the common desire of citizens, but due to economic factors, there are still many instances of "making do with the simplest possible" places. Moreover, with the national tradition of "self-restraint," people are absolutely unwilling to "sacrifice others to seek exclusive enjoyment." Therefore, some of our citizens still have shacks and pigeon-loft-style housing. If we want to improve this, we should eliminate the causes. What are the causes? That is, excessive taxes and high rents, and excessive fees for public utilities. The prerequisite for improvement is for municipal organs to build public housing, specifying the lowest rents and the lowest taxes, and adding cheap public utilities. If there are names that "do not consider the fundamental but are concerned with the superficial," taking actions that are intended for improvement but are only sufficient to create disturbances, the colleagues of this federation should exhaust their meager abilities to eliminate them and ensure the "safety" of citizens' housing. ㊃ Assisting in Training: Civic training is a national policy for reviving the nation. This federation is aware of this, so it assists in holding training sessions. Currently, there are already 500 citizens in the district who are undergoing training. This session should continue to assist, so that citizens within the district receive training within the prescribed scope, cultivate the spirit of hard work, quick work, and tough work, and cultivate the righteousness of understanding propriety, valuing integrity, and honoring shame, in order to defend the country and protect the locality. This declaration is hereby made for your public information.

Election results: Executive Committee members: Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Tao Leqin, Zhang Xianfang, Wang Zhaocheng, Cao Zhigong, Ding Zhemian, Yu Chuanding, Zhang Yi'ao, Chen Jiufeng, Wang Manyun, Liu Zhongying, Xiao Yihan, Xu Xiaochu, Ge Futian, Chen Jicheng, Wang Jian'e, Yu Yaoqiu, Zhu Yakui, Zhang Tianbai, Li Aokui, Chao Jimei, Ye Jiaxing, Wang Jingdong, Zhang Binggai, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Qizhen, Wu Nongxuan, Qiu Jiaxie, Gu Yucang, Song Shisu, Lu Deqin, Tu Kaizheng, Yu Hualong, Zhang Dafu, etc., 25 people.

### Foreign Ships Carrying Lured Chinese Citizens Abroad

Forty-seven people from Qingtian, the crew refused investigation

Recruiting Chinese citizens to go abroad to work under compulsion has long been prohibited by our government. However, when a certain Italian ship was exporting a few days ago, it was reported that 80 Chinese laborers had been lured to Italy. Yesterday morning at approximately 8:00 AM, the French postal ship "Porthos," of the French postal ship company, docked at the Hongkou China Merchants Wharf. There were also 47 people taking passage to France. The Municipal Police Bureau was informed beforehand and dispatched detectives along with patrol officers from the Water Police Station to board the ship and investigate. As they were about to repatriate them, the ship claimed that they had not received an order from the consulate and instructed the officers to report to our government and request the consulate to inform them so that they could refuse such Chinese laborers from boarding next time, etc. The officers then returned to the bureau to report. It is reported that these people are from Qingtian, Zhejiang. They were secretly lured with promises of earning huge sums of money working abroad. Those with shallow knowledge believed it to be true and rushed to Xiamen, Shantou and other places to obtain passports and transferred to Shanghai for export by boat. Little did they know that once they left their motherland, they would lose their freedom. Furthermore, the first year's wages would be deducted by the recruiters, and only a small amount of wages would be received in the second year, barely enough to make ends meet. By then, it would be too late to regret it.

### Animal Disease Prevention Institute Studies Cattle Mating

Investigating Cattle in the City to Improve Breeds

The Animal Disease Prevention Institute, jointly operated by the Commodity Inspection Bureau and the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, noted that Chinese farmers and dairy farms do not study cattle breeding. Each bull (i.e., "sao" bull) is mated with a cow indefinitely, often hindering the health of the cattle and reducing milk production. Therefore, it is planned to investigate the general situation and provide guidance and corrections, and to prepare for the future purchase of "sao" bulls to improve breeds. Last month, Chen Rongding, director of the institute, was sent to various districts in Pudong to conduct field investigations of cattle numbers and observe the current situation. However, due to misunderstandings caused by the cattle owners not knowing the content, the investigation could not proceed. The institute has now changed its approach, first going to the offices of the municipal commissioners in each district to request assistance. The municipal commissioners of each district will then convene the Tu Di Bao to issue survey forms, explain the purpose to the cattle owners, and investigate and report the number, type, name, and address of the cattle. The institute will then conduct a re-examination based on the information on the forms, thereby simplifying the process and avoiding misunderstandings.

### Shanghai Paper Mill Enforcement Case Damages Creditor Rights

All paper machines for One Drying Cylinder; Plaintiff and Defendant Both Absent

Zhao Guanqing, residing at 627 Datong Road, Beike Road, once transferred all the movable property of the Minsheng Paper Mill in Baoshan Road to the Shanghai Paper Mill. Three years ago, he sued Zhang Deming of the Shanghai Paper Mill in the local court for the return of the factory base. In 1935, he requested the local court to seal up all of Shanghai Paper Mill and put it up for auction. Later, when Ye Yinshan and others, executive members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, declared an objection to the enforcement, Luo Tong was the president of the court. Serious disputes arose over the issue of advancing the auction, and even the Control Yuan investigated and some judges were transferred. The turmoil was unusually great. Subsequently, the Jiangsu High Court approved the appeal of Ye Yinshan and others, and the auction was temporarily suspended after the payment of a deposit. On the one hand, Ye and others filed a lawsuit in accordance with the enforcement objection procedure, which has now concluded in three trials. Zhao Guanqing, in the local court, filed a criminal lawsuit against Ye Yinshan, Zhang Deming, Zheng Yicheng, and others for the crime of damaging creditor rights due to the reasons in this case. According to the main points of the plaintiff's complaint, the original judgment in this case was to seal up and auction off all of the paper machines together. However, Ye Yinshan and others strongly claimed that only one drying cylinder was the object of the auction. The litigation has dragged on for many years since 1935, and after the three trials were concluded, the original court was unable to enforce the judgment based on the complete case file sent to the higher court. The delay of many years and the resulting damage to interest and other expenses were a deliberate attempt to damage creditor rights. He requested that the matter be investigated and handled in accordance with the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Shanxiang opened the court. Zhao was represented by his son Zhao Yangchun. Because the defendant did not appear in court, he was ordered to reschedule the hearing.

### Returned Overseas Chinese from Spain Sent Back by the Social Affairs Bureau

Repatriated to Original Home in Qingtian, Zhejiang

Twenty-three overseas Chinese residing in Spain returned to China to avoid the war in that country. They had previously petitioned the Overseas Chinese Affairs Police and Social Affairs Bureaus to subsidize their travel expenses. It is learned that the Social Affairs Bureau has arranged for these overseas Chinese to be repatriated to their respective homes in Qingtian, Zhejiang.

### Crying from Coffin; True Story of Rumor of Resurrected Dead Child in Xujiahui

Zhang Lao Liu's Young Daughter Was Not Yet Dead; Old Xu's Curiosity Led Him to Take the Child Out

Residents of Xujiahui Town in western Shanghai have been spreading rumors since the night before last that a child surnamed Mou had died a long time ago and was resurrected after being put in a coffin, or that a child was kidnapped by bandits and put in a coffin, and was intercepted by the police while walking on the road, etc. The truth of the matter has now been discovered and recorded as follows: It turns out that the two-year-old daughter of Zhang Lao Liu (who does odd jobs), a resident of Anhui who lives at No. 2582, Wuzhoufang, Xuxu Road, has been suffering from illness for a long time and has not been cured. On the afternoon before yesterday, the child's condition worsened, and she suddenly became expressionless and speechless, with a faint breath. Her father, seeing this, knew that she was beyond help and immediately bought a small coffin and put the child, who had not yet died, into it. At around 6:00 PM, he hired an old Shandong man named Xu (who lives in a shack under the Tianyao Bridge) to carry her to a nearby wilderness to be discarded. However, Xu felt a slight movement under his arm on the way, so he temporarily lifted the coffin lid slightly. At around 11:00 PM, Xu, out of curiosity, invited a neighbor, Mr. Mou, to go and see again. Sure enough, he heard crying coming from the coffin. Xu was overjoyed and took the child out. However, this was discovered by the police officer on duty at Post No. 3428 in that area, who was deeply afraid that there were other circumstances and took him back to the Jinjiqiao Police Station. After a brief interrogation by Chief He Song, Zhang Lao Liu was summoned on yesterday morning, along with the child and the small coffin, and sent to the Xujiahui Police Station. The police were dispatched to investigate the above situation and ordered Zhang Lao Liu to take the child home and seek medical treatment. Old Xu was released without charge.

### Zhang Fang, Chairman of the Henan Relief Committee, Reports on Disaster Situation

The disaster situation in Henan Province is serious and getting worse. The chairman of the Henan Relief Committee recently sent a telegram to Tang Yunqing, a representative stationed in Shanghai, requesting the newspapers to call for relief. The original telegram is as follows: Confidential, forwarded to Tang Yunqing, forwarded to all newspapers: The situation in Henan Province is dire. Since last year, from summer to autumn, no rain has fallen, resulting in a major disaster. The land is barren for thousands of miles, and millions of people are starving to death. The displacement and deaths are too horrible to bear. The committee previously went to Beijing and Shanghai to appeal for help. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao of the Relief Commission and Mr. Lu Bohong and Mu Ouchu of the Cilian Association went to Henan to investigate and believed that the disaster was serious and in urgent need of relief. An article entitled "Henan Disaster Inspection Record" was printed and sent to various places. The Ministry of Finance also ordered the issuance of 320,000 yuan for emergency relief and work relief. Although the disaster areas were assigned funds, universal relief was not achieved, but many starving people were still alive. It was hoped that since the beginning of spring, timely rain would fall and the wheat would be promising. Unexpectedly, not a drop of rain fell, and the drought was even more severe. The two inches of rain received a few days ago were quickly dried up by the hot winds that have been blowing for days. The only wheat seedlings have withered, and the autumn crops have not yet been sown. The disaster situation is getting worse and the people's situation is becoming more dangerous. The great calamity is vast and unknown. In addition to telegraphing the Executive Yuan and the Cilian Association to request relief, I implore you to be mindful of the people's suffering, widely publicize the situation, and publish this news as much as possible to attract the attention of people from all walks of life. The disaster victims are fortunate, and Henan Province is fortunate. Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Disaster Relief Committee.

### Jin Xing Factory Worker Zhang Xianglin Humiliated; Police Station Investigates

Twenty-one Defendants from Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Union Remanded

The Jin Xing Silk Weaving Factory at No. 36, Longshun Lane, Yulin Road, has been closed since the strike that occurred on March 16. The conditions on both sides of labor and capital were too far apart to reach agreement. Among the workers who joined the work stoppage was Zhang Xianglin (from Shaoxing). Because of financial constraints, Zhang sneaked into the factory to work privately. The director of the Shanghai Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Union at No. 138, Lane 130, Jiren Road, learned of this and sent two workers to the factory on the 28th to drag him out and assault him. A large number of union members used wooden sticks and stones to damage the glass windows and guardhouse, etc., resulting in the factory being unable to resume work to this day. At 5:30 PM on the day before yesterday, Zhang Xianglin was passing by Qiwupu Road when he was stopped by several workers from the union and taken to the union to talk. At the union, the chairman, surnamed Fang, decided on a method of disposal. A piece of white paper was inscribed with the words "Zhang Xianglin is a lackey of the Jin Xing Factory and betrays his conscience." He was made to kneel on the ground with the paper pasted on his chest, and Zhang Sijin, an employee of the Xin Xin Photo Studio at No. 648, Huade Road, took a picture. After the incident, he was detained for three and a half hours before being released and instructed not to report to the police, otherwise, drastic measures would be taken. Zhang Xianglin, after suffering this humiliation, consulted with his relatives and immediately reported to the Yulin Road Police Station. A large number of Chinese and Western detectives, armed with weapons, accompanied him to the union and arrested 21 people related to the coercion of Zhang Xianglin at the time, including Wang Tongxing, Zhao Jinkang, Liu Hanmei, He Binliang, and Zhu Chengmei, along with the photo booklets, slogans, and six long and short wooden sticks, all of which were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and stated that the strike at the silk weaving factory was instigated by the workers after collective deliberation, and they had considerable influence. He requested an extension of the case for a detailed investigation by the Political Department of the General Inspectorate to determine whether the union was a reactionary organization. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Zhang Xianglin, and Zhang Sijin, an employee of the Xin Xin Photo Studio, testified about the circumstances at the time. Under questioning by Judge Zhong Qing, the defendants' statements were vague, and the Chinese and Western detectives presented the evidence seized, including the photos, booklets, and wooden sticks. The court ordered that Wang Tongxing and the other 20 people be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further investigation and decision.

### New Contribution from Chemical Factory

Domestically Produced Hydrochloric Acid Sufficient for Self-Supply

The Zhao Xin Chemical Factory has been in operation for more than seven years. Various domestically produced chemical industrial raw materials such as carbonic acid, calcium sulfide alkali, rice flour, mirabilite, yellow dextrin, etc., have long won the trust of major factories. The hydrochloric acid, which has been in preparation for many years, has been tested in recent months and the results have been very satisfactory. It has now been officially put into production, producing products with pure quality and accurate strength. Hydrochloric acid is a major raw material for the chemical industry. Industries such as seasonings, dyeing and weaving, lead and iron, and nail manufacturing require a large amount of it. Previously, the supply of domestically produced hydrochloric acid was insufficient, and a portion was still obtained from overseas. Since the preparation of the hydrochloric acid in the factory has been completed, the factories in this city with access to information have been ordering it one after another. The business side has been feeling overwhelmed, which is not only the glory of the factory but also the glory of the domestic chemical industry. The Ministry of Industry has also issued the National Character No. 458 First-Class Domestic Goods Certificate to encourage them.

### 寶豐軋沉民船

A 民船 Sunk by "Baofeng"

At Pier No. 10 in Nanshi, One Boat Sunk, One Damaged

The "Baofeng" steamer, belonging to the Jufeng Steamship Company of Nanshi, which sails the Shanghai to Chongming and Qidong route, was returning to Shanghai from Chongming on the afternoon of the 14th at approximately 7 p.m. When approaching Pier No. 10 in Nanshi to dock, it collided with and sank one civilian boat and damaged another, causing considerable damage. Yesterday, the shipowner, Huang Ruiyi, reported to the company and the Navigation Administration Bureau, stating that the ship arrived in front of Pier No. 10 at 7 p.m. on the 14th. Due to the "Xin Ruiping" steamer yielding, it didn't start to dock until 7:10 p.m. At that time, dozens of cargo ships carrying cigarettes, foreign wine, and foreign pine wood were moored at the public pier to the south, obstructing the steamer. To the north, four civilian boats carrying garbage, etc., were also moored there. At this point, the bow of the steamer was facing the south wind and was in a downward current. Therefore, during docking, the stern crushed two civilian boats carrying garbage. One of the boats immediately sank into the river due to the hull breaking. The other boat was severely damaged. At the time of the accident, the cargo ships were thrown into panic, and it took a long time for the situation to calm down. Fortunately, the boatman of the sunken boat was unharmed. The company has sent personnel to inspect the damaged boats and is arranging for the sunken boat to be salvaged to another location. At the same time, the Navigation Administration Bureau and the insurance company have been notified. Further investigation and inquiry into the responsibility for the accident are needed.

All 500+ workers at the Mei Ya No. 10 Factory (i.e., Zhicheng Silk Factory) at Baziqiao in Zhabei previously went on strike to demand better treatment and conditions, but the strike failed.

### 丹麥人撞死倒糞老嫗

Danish Man Runs Over and Kills Elderly Woman Collecting Excrement

Family Demands 1,000 Yuan in Compensation; Deaf Mute Only Willing to Pay Expenses

A Danish national, Atto Sheng (transliteration), residing in Room 4 of the company's building at No. 395 Fuli Li Road in the French Concession, attended the British King's coronation ceremony at the racetrack on the night of the 13th. At 4 a.m. the following morning, he drove his car, No. 7109, back to his residence. At 4:35 a.m., as the car was passing the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road, an elderly woman named You Lu, a native of Suzhou, 53 years old, residing at No. 9 Kangji Lane, Malang Road, was pushing a cart of excrement in front of him. Atto Sheng drove the car to that location, where the road was slippery due to the rain. He was unable to brake and ran over You, causing injuries to her head and leg. Patrolmen who witnessed the incident recorded the car's license plate and sent the injured woman to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They also reported the case to the police station for verification. However, You died at 5 p.m. on the 14th due to her injuries. The police station transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan funeral parlor for examination. Yesterday, they reported to Prosecutor Dong Qiwu of the Special Court No. 2, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the parlor to determine that You Lu had died from injuries caused by the car accident. The body was handed over to her husband, You A'xiao, for burial. It is reported that the victim's family is demanding 1,000 yuan in compensation from the car owner for damages. The defendant, on the other hand, claims that the excrement cart pushed by the deceased did not have lights and blames the deceased for the accident. He is only willing to pay for medical, funeral, and other expenses.

Glimpses of Confessions Obtained in the Kidnapping Case by the Wet Nurse

Chen San Guniang Has Two Lovers; Confesses That Zhang Guisheng Instigated the Crime

The case of the wet nurse Shen Chen, of the Ji family at No. 208 Gonghe Road, Zhabei, kidnapping the young master and demanding a huge ransom of 20,000 yuan has been reported in the newspapers. The following is an excerpt of the confessions obtained from the captured criminals in this case. ⑴ Zhang Guisheng (aka Wang Asi) was the first criminal apprehended (already handed over to the Shanghai District Court). He confessed that he was working as a partner in a garment shop in Hexing Lane, No. 8, opposite the Ji family. Last year, he made wedding clothes for the Li family for about six months. During this period, he had an affair with the wet nurse Shen Chen (aka Chen San Guniang) and often met her in hotels. On April 3 of this year, Chen suddenly told me that because the Ji family was about to wean the young master, she decided to take the young master away and hide him. I advised her not to do it, but she said it didn't matter and asked me to first book Room No. 9 at the New Shanghai Hotel in Louhua Lane, Route Robert. On the morning of the 4th, Chen indeed brought the young master Ji Gengshou (aka Gengshou) to the hotel. She had told me in advance that she could bring out 200 yuan. So, that morning, I asked her if she had gotten the money. She told me that the child was the money. In the afternoon, she asked me to borrow a room from the Hu family at No. 90 Rongqing Lane, Route Jisi Fei'er, Caojiadu, stating that the rent was 3.5 yuan for two months. After I took Chen to see the room in Rongqing Lane, she asked me to write a note with the address: No. 90 Rongqing Lane, Route Jisi Fei'er, Caojiadu, Shanghai. Later, she took the young master there. Before she left, she told me that things would be taken care of and that she would come back. Otherwise, she would definitely send me a message within ten days. Until April 13, I was arrested by your team. I really don't know where Chen went. She said she was going back to Jiangbei. ⑵ Wang Beikui (aka Wang Bokui) confessed that Chen San Guniang was my lover. On April 30, she brought the young master to my house. I asked her what was going on. She said that a person named Wang Asi had told her to bring the young master out and gave me a note asking me to find Wang Asi in Shanghai. So, I set off on May 2 and arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 3rd. I was arrested at No. 90 Rongqing Lane, Route Jisi Fei'er, Caojiadu. Later, I was taken to Jiangbei to arrest Shen Chen, Fan Yutai, Ding Wenduan, etc., and bring them back to Shanghai. ⑶ Shen Chen confessed that Wang Beikui was my first lover. My real husband's name is Shen Linzhi. Zhang Guisheng is my second lover. I went to the Ji family as a wet nurse in December of the year before last, recommended by the Huang matchmaking shop. Wang Beikui was my guarantor. This time, Zhang Guisheng instigated me to take the young master away. He started having an affair with me in June of last year. At that time, Zhang was a partner at the Gong garment shop at No. 8 Hexing Lane. On the morning of April 4 of this year, Zhang Guisheng sent his younger brother to the Ji family's door to say that his brother Guisheng was waiting for me at the New Shanghai Hotel on Route Robert. So, I took a diamond ring from the owner's pocket, a pair of glasses from the young lady's clothes, and some money, and took the young master to the Xinshanghai Hotel by ferry at Chadaijiao. Later, I gave the diamond ring and 32 yuan in legal tender to Zhang Guisheng for safekeeping. At dawn on the morning of May 5, I walked to the Zhenru Railway Station, took a train to Suzhou, and hired a small boat with Shi Chaogan and Zhang Laoer. I boarded the boat and sailed east for about 20 days. The expenses along the way were borne by Shi and Zhang. Later, when the boat arrived at Lucao Dang in Jiangbei, one night, when Shi and Zhang were asleep, I took the young master ashore and fled to Dashihe in Huai'an, where I found Wang Beikui. He sent me to Fan Yutai's house, the head of the baojia, for temporary residence. I also gave him the note with Zhang Guisheng's alias, Wang Asi, and asked him to look for him in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, he was arrested by your team. Later, I heard that someone from Shanghai was coming to arrest me, so my relative Pan Liu, who runs a teahouse, sent me to a dilapidated temple, where I was arrested. ⑷ Fan Yutai confessed that at noon on April 30, Wang Beikui told me that San Guniang had returned and had brought with her a young master who was being nursed in Shanghai. I asked him what was going on. Beikui said he didn't know. On May 2, Beikui set off for Shanghai, leaving San Guniang at my house. Later, San Guniang's relative Pan Liu came to pick her up. On the morning of the 8th, I heard that the Zhenjiang Command Headquarters and the Shanghai Detective Team were coming to arrest her and asked me to lead them to arrest her, so I was brought here with her. ⑸ Ding Wenduan confessed that I have been making incense at the Gaoma Temple (aka Gaoma Temple) for many years. The temple doors are closed at night. That morning, when I opened the door, I saw a woman (i.e., Chen San Guniang) standing at the temple door with a child. I didn't pay attention to it and went to the kitchen inside to start a fire. She went into the temple to rest, and I saw Pan Liu, who runs a teahouse at Yangqiaotou, also at the door. Before long, the Zhenjiang Garrison Command and the Shanghai Detective Team arrived and surrounded the temple. Chen San Guniang was arrested. They brought me here as an accomplice. It is also understood that the victim's family has received four letters from the bandits and negotiated many times, but without success. The case is currently being prepared for transfer to the New Zhabei Police Precinct and then to the Shanghai District Court for investigation and prosecution.

### “惟是頂好”電氣冰箱公開展覽

"Westinghouse" Electric Refrigerators on Public Display

Westinghouse Electric, which recently received the world's largest electric refrigerator order, will hold an exhibition of new 1937 "Westinghouse" electric refrigerators today at Old Jinlong Foreign Firm, No. 161 Museum Road, and at No. 978 Jing'an Temple Road (opposite Moshang Wu Road; open as usual on Sunday mornings). This exhibition is expected to attract even more public attention than in previous years. One reason is that the company has the largest record of refrigerator purchases by the U.S. government. The second is that it is currently implementing a large-scale kitchen experiment program. Please read on for details. The U.S. government ordered 16,697 electric refrigerators for low-cost housing for the general population and invited bids from businesses in advance. The main condition was that bidders had to specify the initial purchase price of the electric refrigerator and its operating costs over ten years. Bidding manufacturers also had to guarantee that the operating costs were accurate and would be penalized if they exceeded the stated figures. As a result, Westinghouse Electric won the bid. The reason was not that its price was the cheapest but that its guaranteed electricity costs over ten years were the most economical. Westinghouse Electric is conducting a large-scale kitchen experiment program for this year's household electric refrigerator users, considering food protection, convenience, mechanical operating time, freezing speed, operating costs, and long-term material durability. In this program, 89 kitchens have become actual testing stations. The electric refrigerators are providing usage records under normal kitchen conditions. Each kitchen is equipped with various meters and thermometers, as if it were a laboratory. Thus, under the supervision of the 89 housewives, all current consumption, freezing time, and refrigerator temperature inside and outside are recorded. It is said that the results of this experiment will be made public in the future.

Random Thoughts

### Dismantling Attics

— Shen Jiaqian

In order to "rectify the city's appearance," the straw sheds were dismantled on a large scale. Now, due to "hygiene, fire prevention, and public safety" concerns, attics are about to be dismantled as well. The Municipal Council's considerate planning for our citizens is truly tireless.

In this foreign concession, apart from a few wealthy people and the so-called "upper-class Chinese" who live in tall buildings, most people huddle in "Chinese-style houses." The straw sheds, which were even lower in status, have already been demolished after receiving fourteen yuan in "alms," so there's no need to discuss them further.

Now, the dismantling of attics, which is "submitted to the board of directors for discussion," is the turn of "Chinese-style houses." It is probably true that "Chinese-style houses" are unhygienic, prone to fire, and hinder public safety. Even those of us who live in them every day "to shelter from the wind and rain" feel the need for improvement. Try closing your eyes and imagining: Inside a single-family Chinese-style house, the main room on the ground floor, the upper rooms, and the outer rooms all have sheds built in the courtyards. The common main room becomes a good bedroom (the so-called bedroom is also a family unit). Attics are built in the gaps of the roof ridges, and small rooms are built on top of the sun decks. There is only one staircase for everyone to use, and no one is allowed to step beyond that. Living in this kind of place, you don't see the sun all year round, and there's no talk of fresh air, which is "unhygienic." But every family has to cook, so there are stoves in the east and braziers in the west, which "easily cause fires." Because there are so many people and the population is so complex, the front building is manufacturing red pills, and the back building is hiding kidnapping victims, which "hinders public safety." The three points that the Municipal Council is concerned about are indeed "hitting the nail on the head," but why do these people feel so safe in such a dangerous place like a powder keg? This can be understood by looking at the report of the Committee for the Investigation of Living Conditions organized by the Municipal Council. The report states: "In 1930, the Chinese population was 971,397, renting 72,686 Chinese-style houses, with 1,509 Chinese-style houses unoccupied. By 1935, the Chinese population had increased to 1,120,860, renting 74,952 Chinese-style houses, but the number of unoccupied Chinese-style houses had increased to 6,967."

The population is increasing, but the number of empty houses is also increasing. This report shows that the families living in "Chinese-style houses" are becoming more and more crowded and smaller and smaller. This is because "life" is becoming more and more difficult, and people are naturally calculating everywhere.

When the shantytowns were demolished, the construction of public housing was also rejected because there were "many empty houses" in western Shanghai. The current demolition of attics is probably based on regulating those surplus houses, using "hygiene, fire prevention, and public safety" as great excuses, which is the same as "rectifying the city's appearance." However, those who live in straw sheds are only fit to live in straw sheds, and those who live in attics are only fit to live in attics. Once the straw sheds are demolished, they "sleep on the streets and in alleys." Where is the "rectification of the city's appearance" mentioned? After the attics are demolished, these families probably won't have a better way out! If we continue to do this in a way that is akin to choking because of fear of eating, the 6,967 empty houses may become an even more alarming number.

Finally, I don't hope what the results of the board of directors' discussion are, but I really hope that you will think about "hygiene, fire prevention, and public safety"!

### Celestial Law: Floating Corpses and "Black Hell"

— Wen

Floating corpses, more floating corpses found in the Hai River in Tianjin. Such horrifying news is recorded in the newspapers every day. The Tianjin correspondent reported on the 12th: "In the Dazhigu area of Tianjin's Hai River, floating corpses have been discovered continuously. From early April to the 7th of this month, a total of eighty-seven bodies have been recovered. The corpses are ashen purple and swollen, their appearance utterly tragic." The Public Security Bureau and the police are "investigating everywhere, with a dense network of patrols along the river. However, our side has no right to enter the concessions on the west bank of the Hai River, so we can only watch from across the river." Since the authorities offered a reward for solving the case, four strong men were found carrying a corpse from the south (i.e., the Japanese concession). According to the captured Yang Xiang and Kong Zhaoyuan, they confessed to being coolies, privately hired to carry corpses and throw them into the river. Furthermore, an urgent telegram on the 11th stated: "The First Bureau interrogated Yan Jiaqi, who inquired with the Japanese Police Chief, Kazui, who clearly indicated that the matter was the work of the Japanese area's opium dens and should be investigated and suppressed..." Thus, it completely proves that this case is related to a "friendly nation."

To show that the Tianjin police are very concerned about this case, although it has only come to light today, it has been delayed for too long, and it cannot prove the true purpose of someone killing and discarding corpses. However, it is at least somewhat better than last year when none of the four floating corpses found around the same time were solved. This also shows that such serious cases involving human lives are not impossible to solve, unless one dares not solve them or deems it unnecessary to solve them. Then hundreds of floating corpses will forever become wronged souls, and the enemy's cruelty will become even bolder and more rampant. For six years, China's greatest enemy, in its vain attempt to swallow the entire country and conquer this unconquerable nation, has used all kinds of inhumane methods against our compatriots, openly and secretly creating countless wronged souls. What do killing a thousand or so coolies in Tianjin matter in the eyes of devils? Only we, the slaves who refuse to die submissively, can be enraged and end this massacre through struggle.

This incident has naturally attracted the attention of the Chinese people, but there seems to be little artistic reflection. As far as I know, only Ling He's four-act play "Black Hell" takes last year's floating corpse incident as its theme. Recently, I heard that the Guangzhou Artists Association's public performance of this play aroused the enthusiastic attention of over a thousand audience members. The Nanjing Drama School will also perform it in early next month, and the Xiaoguang Drama Society and the Forties Drama Society are also rehearsing it. It can be seen that the theatrical community attaches great importance to national defense plays against traitors.

I am completely an amateur when it comes to drama, but from the standpoint of someone unwilling to be a subjugated people, I dare to frankly introduce this script to millions of readers. In the fourth act, the author has the traitor Ma Guocai say: "...The coolies who were recruited were for digging cellars and burying gunpowder... Fearing they would reveal where the gunpowder was piled... They were killed with poison, and their faces were destroyed with nitric acid, then flushed into the Hai River from the sewers with water." Here, he speculates on the reason why thousands of coolies were killed. Although it is speculation, we believe that such reasoning is not far from the truth. On the one hand, the author writes about the coolies seeking a way to survive only to walk to their deaths, and on the other hand, he writes about the extravagance and shamelessness of the traitors. The author himself, through the mouth of the young Xu Yi, confidently says: "...The thirty million people in the Northeast are all our comrades, our brothers. In the past, our ranks only included bandits, farmers, and enemy soldiers, but now, not to mention students and workers, even teachers, officers, landlords, and even wealthy people have joined our ranks... It is because they have been forced into a dead end that they have embarked on this path to survival. If every Chinese person embarks on this path and is determined to fight, and is willing to risk their lives to recover lost territory, then we can guarantee that the future victory will be ours..."

At a time when the floating corpse case has angered every Chinese person, I dare to excitedly recommend this "Black Hell."

### Gleanings from the Mountains and Fields

— Zou Heng

On the Mountain Road

Starting from the foot of the mountain, dense, verdant pine trees completely cover the winding mountain road. The wind brings waves of pine needles rustling like the ocean, mixed with the distant scent of donkey dung and earth.

After passing the Mid-Mountain Pavilion, the mountain path is no longer flat, but even more tortuous, with scattered rocks strewn across it. Thorny bushes and low-lying jujube leaves frequently block the way. Bits of spiky brambles and jujube thorns often cling to one's clothing. Occasionally, among the yellowing, fallen leaves and dry grass, the sound of grasshoppers can be heard. Bending down, one can discover lizards just two or three inches long, the same color as the earth. With a light step, they immediately disappear into the cracks between the stones.

Steep cliffs are always looming ahead. The road is rugged and treacherous. After walking for a while, one's legs feel too tired to lift, and the whole body is exhausted. Thus, one rests on a mountain rock.

Looking back, one sees half a mountain view: old, green pine forests concealing rows of houses, valleys, temples, the balconies and corridors of villas, all floating happily in the sunlight. In the distant mountains, a few small black and white dots tremble—horses or sheep grazing. The arduous path taken, however, is finely coiled on the mountainside, like sheep intestines.

The rugged mountaintop is finally near.

To the north, the jagged mountain peaks are layered and winding like sheep. Ahead, the mist is hazy. In the distance, the Hun River flows like a belt, and the shadows of the Jade Spring Hill Pagoda, the Paiyun Hall, and Kunming Lake... are all visible. The nearby Azure Cloud Temple, however, is buried in the valley.

The mountaintop is tranquil, with only occasional sounds of roosters crowing and dogs barking wafting up from below, and a few strokes of distant bells, lofty and far-reaching…

### Before the Rural Inn

Two thatched huts, nestled on an earthen mound at the foot of the mountain.

Deep brown grape vines have just been trained onto the trellis. Underneath the trellis, simple tables and long benches are neatly arranged. On one of the tables in the middle, are some soda, sweets, teacups, and pastries.

The innkeeper and his wife are dressed plainly, matching the antique window frames of the thatched hut. They treat guests cordially and honestly, unlike the slickness of city dwellers.

Beside the chicken coop stands a small child and a dog. The child has one hand resting on the dog's back, while the other is in his mouth. His shy gaze is fixed on the unfamiliar guests.

Occasionally, a caravan of camels passes by on the main road, serenely and leisurely bringing a string of wind chimes' quiet melody.

A cigarette, a bowl of steaming noodles, disperses half a day's fatigue. Moreover, before one's eyes lies an endless wilderness, and the peach blossoms beside the inn and the goose-yellow willow branches on the road perfectly illustrate the verse: "Peach blossoms in the rural inn, a pink and white sight, willow branches by the road, green wisps of smoke." One's heart, along with the pale blue smoke rings, curls gently into the sky.

The sun has already slanted westward. The outline of the mountains is even clearer under the azure sky. The side of the mountain shrouded in the setting sun is like a layer of light purple gauze.

Some donkey drivers are sleeping soundly by the roadside, while others are arguing loudly with guests over prices. The donkeys, however, are vigorously chewing on fodder, occasionally striking the ground with their heavy hooves...

### Also Considered a Bit of "Entertainment"

— Xing An

Mr. Wu Cun's "Watching the Fun" is truly written "lively." It is a pity that at the end he only says "Pushing and shoving in the crowded night, getting covered in sweat, then inexplicably returning home, saying to his wife: 'The British Emperor's coronation, a sea of people, several children and women were crushed, truly a sight to behold!'" He did not expect that these people watching the fun could tell their wives even more interesting "news"!

Look at it! Are there not now several women being grossly insulted by a gang of rascals? Some were dragged down from rickshaws, their clothes torn off, and their lower bodies and buttocks were injured. Some were dragged into alleys, where lewd acts were committed, damaging their lower bodies. Even a pregnant woman had her rickshaw overturned, falling to the ground and being mounted, with attempts made at indecent assault. This is only what has been discovered in the newspapers. Other "interesting dramas" are probably even more numerous!

Since they are called "rascals," their actions will naturally not be "reliable." The excitement at the racetrack this time gave them the best opportunity. In the "pushing and shoving, crowded" excitement, anything can be done. Moreover, they also knew that celebrating the "British Emperor's coronation" and taking the opportunity to make a big scene, the police would never interfere. Thus, everyone gathered in groups and went to the street. If there were wallets or wristwatches to steal, they would steal them. If they encountered women, they would make lewd remarks or even physically insult them. This not only made themselves happy but also made others laugh. Isn't that so? When that pregnant woman was being mounted, with attempts made at indecent assault, not only did no one step forward to rescue her, but some bystanders even cheered in unison! This is what makes it exciting!

It can be seen that that night's excitement was not in vain. Although everyone "got covered in sweat," it was worth it. And "inexplicably returning home," they could still laugh and say to their wives: "It was truly a sight to behold. Several women were stripped completely naked, living mannequins!"

The ceremony held in London this time was extremely lively. It is said that about two million people watched it. So the crowding at the racetrack was nothing. However, in London, more than nine thousand people had accidents, and one old man suffocated to death. Shanghai, however, staged several "interesting dramas" to add to the fun, which cannot be said to be less exciting!

It's just that the rascals' pranks are too "rascally"! If this "entertainment" is reported to London, it will surely make the British laugh their heads off!

### Sunrise

Chen Bailu, a lively and lovely woman, because she could not resist vanity, temptation, and the inescapable evil environment, finally committed suicide. Her former friend Fang Dasheng is a pure young man who has just entered society, and has been subjected to all kinds of stimulation, causing him to almost become excited, but he handled everything well with reason, and gained many, many insights and experiences. He sympathized with Xiao Dongxi, he wanted to fight Jin Batou, he wanted to eradicate people like Jin Batou from society. Wang Fusheng, the tea room attendant in the hotel, is an experienced representative of a thorough villain who "flatters the rich and despises the poor." Zhang Qiaozhi, after returning from studying abroad, has learned a consistent ability to be a sycophant. In this very small officialdom, he lives what seems to be a very comfortable life. Pan Yueting, the manager of Dafeng Bank, uses all his decades of experience and wisdom in every way, not hesitating to use the most insidious means to deceive his lenders and borrowers, but as a result, he cannot escape Jin Batou's means, and ends up bankrupt to an unimaginable degree. Huang Shengsan, his bank clerk, has his rice bowl broken by him, and walks the road to suicide. The secretary, Li Shijing, however, reveals his secrets at a critical moment and is promoted to assistant manager, but he also suffers the same loss and bankruptcy soon after. Gu Ba Nanny, an old and fat middle-aged woman, relies on her wealth to dress herself up in a very flirtatious way. In the midst of her inability to endure the bitterness of sexuality, she also becomes acquainted with Hu Si, the pretty boy who sings female roles. The two of them live their lives in this uncoordinated, irregular way. Cui Xi, long trampled in the hell on earth that is a third-class brothel, has an entire living being ground down into an endless environment, but there is also a tiny living being! Xiao Dongxi! Is also sold to her brothel. Xiao Dongxi, unable to bear such cruel beatings, actually ended her life with a rope.

The short four-act play exposes all kinds of sins and pains in the world, reveals all the black curtains and hypocrisy, and conveys from the psychology of each person how the devil is showing its power, and how it is preparing to swallow all purity and truth. "When the sun rises, let the darkness remain behind." Here we are waiting for it.
